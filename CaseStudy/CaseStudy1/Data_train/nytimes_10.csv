Health,Can Antibody Tests Help End the Coronavirus Pandemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/health/can-antibody-tests-help-end-the-coronavirus-pandemic.html,"A survey of New Yorkers last week found that one in five city residents carried antibodies to the new coronavirus -- and in that, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo saw good news. If so many had been infected and survived, he reasoned, the virus may be far less deadly than previously thought. But many scientists took a darker view, seeing instead a vast pool of people who are still very vulnerable to infection. Like the leaders of many states, Mr. Cuomo has been hoping that the results of large-scale antibody testing may guide decisions about when and how to reopen the economy and reintegrate society. Few scientists ever imagined that these tests would become an instrument of public policy -- and many are uncomfortable with the idea. Antibody tests, which show who has been infected, are often inaccurate, recent research suggests, and it is not clear whether a positive result actually signals immunity to the coronavirus.

On Friday, the World Health Organization warned against relying on these tests for policy decisions. While countries such as Italy have even floated the idea of ""immunity passports"" for people who test positive, W.H.O. officials noted that it is not known to what extent people carrying antibodies are immune to the virus. But widespread testing has started nonetheless, and important decisions are likely to flow from the results. The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and virtually every university with an epidemiology department has begun antibody surveys in communities across the United States. ""It seems like all of a sudden, everybody just decided that antibody tests are going to give them some grand answer,"" said Dr. Michael Osterholm, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Minnesota. The goal of most of these projects is to get a handle on the size and nature of the epidemic here, rather than to guide decisions about reopening the economy. But now scientists are racing to fine-tune the tests and to learn more about what having antibodies actually means, both for the patient and for the community.

The results in New York State offer an early glimpse of the promise and pitfalls of widespread antibody testing. Public health officials tested 3,000 residents at grocery stores and big-box retailers throughout the state. In New York City, about 21 percent of participants were found to carry coronavirus antibodies. The rate was about 17 percent on Long Island, nearly 12 percent in Westchester County and Rockland County, and less than 4 percent in the rest of the state. New York's survey was reasonably well designed and the results largely credible, experts said. But unlike Mr. Cuomo, few saw happy news in the numbers.

""I just don't see any way to put a silver lining on any of these results,"" said Carl Bergstrom, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Washington in Seattle. ""I think that the efforts to spin it that way are irresponsible.""
* Virginia's new lieutenant governor-elect says she won't force vaccines. If one in five residents in hard-hit New York City has been exposed to the virus, he and others said, then four in five are still vulnerable -- and that underscores how far we are from the pandemic's end. New York's results suggested a death rate of between 0.5 and 1 percent, figures some conservative commentators have argued are too low to justify statewide lockdowns. Public health experts like Dr. Bergstrom took the opposite view. ""If the mortality rate is 1 percent, we're looking at 2 million deaths, which is unprecedented in our nation's history and unimaginable,"" he said. ""Anyone talking about the death rate as 'only 1 percent and so we should not worry about it' has an extraordinarily callous view."" The New York survey confirms what experts have long believed: that because of the lack of tests, the state has undercounted the true number of infections by about a factor of 10. Reopening society with such a huge vulnerable population, and without careful consideration, could be disastrous, allowing the virus to sweep through the country, Dr. Bergstrom and others said.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Another lesson from the survey: New York is far from attaining ""herd immunity"" -- a proportion of the community immune to the virus that is so large that the pathogen cannot maintain a toehold. For that to happen, experts have estimated that 60 to 70 percent of the population would need to be immune. Even then, the coronavirus would continue to spread, just at a slower rate. ""Honestly, from an ethical vantage point, herd immunity in the absence of a vaccine is not something we should be aiming to achieve,"" said Maimuna Majumder, a computational epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School. To get there, ""that's a lot of sick people -- and a lot of deaths,"" she added. While these results should not be used to make public health decisions, they can be useful for estimating the size and nature of the epidemic, said Bill Hanage, an epidemiologist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Antibody surveys can also identify high-risk groups, Dr. Dean of the University of Florida pointed out: ""I think that's very important for policy, understanding who are these groups that we need to focus on and work to protect."" The shortcomings of antibody testing were on vivid display in two other recent surveys, one in Santa Clara County and the other in Los Angeles County. Both drew sharp criticism from scientists, who said the tests had a rate of false positives too high to be used in places the virus has left largely untouched and therefore may have few true positives.

Scientists have also repeatedly cautioned that the presence of antibodies does not signify protection from the virus. Some preliminary evidence suggests, for example, that people who are asymptomatic might not produce enough antibodies to prevent a second infection. To be sure about what quantity of antibodies are needed in the blood, researchers need further tests, both to measure the exact amount -- which the majority of rapid tests available do not provide -- as well as more detailed analyses of the antibodies' strength. The answers will take weeks to months. ""We're kind of heavily leaning on these tests when they're not perfect,"" said Saskia Popescu, an epidemiologist at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. ""And we still have a lot of people susceptible, so it's a dangerous thing to heavily rely on them right now."" Dr. Osterholm said an antibody survey, because it provides ""historical data"" on who was infected, is like a smoke alarm that gives out a report once a month. ""It doesn't work very well if you have a fire right now,"" he said. Diagnostic tests for the virus offer a better snapshot of the current picture, he added, and states should focus on acquiring accurate diagnostic tests that can provide timely data on the rise or fall in the number of infections. ""That should be the data we use to judge opening or not opening"" the economy, Dr. Osterholm said.","The tests are not reliable enough to guide policy on lockdowns and reopenings, experts said. But they can help model the spread of the virus.",62ef17b1-97e2-5710-816b-48b1af36f5fd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/26/science/26virus-antibodies1/26virus-antibodies1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2ac62ab03664802682711f18c6583c483ef7d56f90aaeee2b7624c9d8710cb55&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A health care worker labels a blood sample for coronavirus antibody testing at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York.,62ef17b1-97e2-5710-816b-48b1af36f5fd,N24News/imgs/62ef17b1-97e2-5710-816b-48b1af36f5fd.jpg,1
Art & Design,Betye Saar at MoMA: Prelude to a Revolutionary Breakthrough,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/arts/design/betye-saar-moma.html,"Betye Saar's ""Black Girl's Window,"" 1969. Her breakthrough work is the focus of an exhibition helping to reopen the new Museum of Modern Art.





In 1969, Betye Saar made an artwork that would prove pivotal in her career. Taking an old window frame, she filled its 10 sections with a constellation of images. Across the top three panels, she placed colorful printed moons and stars, evoking the night sky. In each of the six squares that follow she set symbolic figures, including an eagle bearing a shield with the word ""love,"" a map of a human head according to the pseudoscience phrenology, and a pair of skeletons, one white and one black. Below these, in the bottom half of the window, Ms. Saar painted the silhouette of a black girl, her eyes made from lenticular lenses and her hands -- marked with astrological signs -- pressed against the glass. The combined effect is moving and forceful, suggesting a young woman wrestling with the ghosts of the past and the vagaries of an uncertain future. She could be staring out the window and dreaming, or she could be looking at us with an appeal.

Although it's not stated in the work or its title, ""Black Girl's Window"" is a kind of self-portrait. Many of the coded references are personal, mixed with ones that are political and occult. The piece represents a cross section of Ms. Saar's interests, and signaled the turn her practice would take toward found objects and more overtly political content -- the hallmarks for which she is now, at age 93, best known.

""Black Girl's Window"" is the focus of one of the exhibitions helping to reopen the new Museum of Modern Art. Concentrating on her early years as an artist, it tracks the experiments in printmaking and assemblage that led her to arrive at the titular work. Despite the unusual color of the gallery's deep purple walls, ""Betye Saar: The Legends of 'Black Girl's Window'"" is relatively modest -- a scholarly study of a specific period, anchored by MoMA's recent acquisition of a group of 42 of her works on paper. It is also, dismayingly, the first show the institution has ever devoted to Ms. Saar. As such, it's smart but not entirely satisfying.

Ms. Saar, who grew up in Pasadena, Calif., was interested in art from a young age. But in the 1940s, ""that was just one of the things black people didn't go into -- they didn't study to be artists,"" she told Frieze magazine several years ago. Instead she took up design, first as an undergraduate and then, nearly a decade later, in graduate school, where she enrolled with the intention of becoming a teacher. As the story goes, however, she ""wandered into a printmaking workshop"" and quickly found herself hooked. By then she was married with two daughters; a third soon followed. One of the earliest prints in the MoMA exhibition, ""Anticipation"" (1961), depicts a pregnant Ms. Saar sitting and holding flowers against a mottled background. She looks tired but serene. Another from the same year, ""Les Enfants d'Obscurite,"" registers as a sort of imaginary ultrasound, showing three babies in a shadowy womb.

Nature was one of Ms. Saar's interests from the beginning, but not in a strictly literal sense: She created moody landscapes as well as mythical scenes starring storybook beasts. These led the way to prints exploring astrology, palmistry and phrenology, including the captivating ""Mystic Chart for an Unemployed Sorceress"" (1964), whose protagonist seems to materialize like an apparition amid a profusion of occult symbols. Clearly for Ms. Saar, the natural and supernatural worlds are extensions of each other, equally wondrous and beyond complete comprehension.

The illusory layering of ""Mystic Chart"" also points to her skillful varying of the textures in her prints. Even at the outset of the exhibition you might notice the impressive diversity of spots and lines -- as well as a few fingerprints -- in a seemingly straightforward work like ""The Wounded Wilderness"" (1962). As she went on, Ms. Saar experimented increasingly with a process called soft-ground etching that allowed her to capture impressions of not only handmade marks but also rubber stamps, copper shapes from a jewelry store and other items; a book that MoMA is publishing alongside the show describes her prints as ""records of objects."" In this way, she was making assemblages in two dimensions. From there it was a short leap to placing the objects themselves in the artworks, especially after seeing an exhibition of Joseph Cornell's enigmatic boxes in 1967. In what almost amounts to a pun on the history of Western painting, Ms. Saar started arranging her prints of occult imagery in old windows, like the one featuring three palms beneath moons and stars (""The Palmist Window,"" 1967). Her frames became gateways to the mysteries of the universe.","A new exhibition concentrates on the artist's early years, tracking the experiments in printmaking and assemblage that led to her pivotal work ""Black Girl's Window.""",6397c0df-6ca5-5e5d-a5d5-386412f5e3ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/18/arts/18moma-saar1/18moma-saar1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=544&w=1040&s=6a3194071fbe3a89785c76d480b78ed6bb51a968a3ec756da72c79d48272c0c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Betye Saar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Black Girl&rsquo;s Window,&rdquo; 1969.

Real Estate,A New Dimension in Home Buying: Virtual Reality,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/realestate/virtual-reality-to-sell-homes.html,"The goggles were strapped to my face like a scuba mask. Only instead of fish, a studio apartment was wavering in my field of vision. I moved forward, trying to enter the bathroom. Feeling slightly seasick, I hit the wall. This was embarrassing. I tried again and smacked into the door frame. ""Are you teleporting?"" asked Jason Darcy, a data scientist and software engineer who works for Halstead Property.

I'd come to Halstead's Manhattan headquarters to test the virtual reality technology that the company is developing. I'd already perused a 400-square-foot West Village resale using a Samsung Gear headset. A Samsung Gear headset can be used to ""walk"" around an apartment and check out its view without ever having to set foot inside. Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times But the Halstead team was most excited about a four-story building in Astoria, Queens, that did not yet exist. Halstead had hired a company called Virtual Xperience to create a virtual rendering based on the architectural plans. The idea was to have potential buyers wear an Oculus Rift headset and ""walk"" around the building. The more realistic the experience, the more likely a client might be willing to pay the asking price of nearly $1.98 million for the building before construction crews even broke ground -- at least that was the hope. ""We sell based on emotion and attaching that emotion to a vision,"" said Matthew J. Leone, the senior vice president of digital marketing for Terra Holdings, the parent company of Halstead. ""Imagine a buyer walking out onto the terrace and thinking: 'If I bought this home and was having breakfast here, this is exactly what I'd see.' That's incredible. For a salesman, it's a dream come true."" So was I teleporting? I kept bumping into virtual walls because the headset was making me extremely nauseated. The Starship Enterprise this was not. Halstead says it will introduce three-dimensional displays and virtual-reality headsets to its offices this year, and the brokerage isn't alone. Greenland Forest City Partners and Douglas Elliman Real Estate are also hoping to add virtual-reality technology in the coming months, as are individual brokers looking for a competitive edge. Digital design firms charge tens of thousands of dollars to create virtual customizable spaces for high-end buyers.

This technology is expected to transform the real estate industry and, some say, make house-hunting more efficient. It can help to reduce the stress of relocating to a new city or buying from abroad and also allow buyers to visualize properties in development. In some cases, the excitement of providing virtual-reality technology to clients has created an outsize sense of the technology's importance. One company was keeping its VR prototype secret, lest a competitor try to steal it. But whether the technology is ready for widespread use -- and whether consumers really want it -- remains an open question. What is now available to consumers and growing more popular is the 3D walk-through. This is an updated version of the panoramic camera shots that were all the rage a decade ago. There's no headset. Users move their mouse or arrow keys from their computer keyboards and devices to navigate through rooms and zoom in on apartment features. Halstead has 3D walk-throughs available for 30 listings, including one on Cornelia Street in the West Village, but its goal is to get its entire inventory online. Mr. Leone said that people stay on a page with a 3D walk-through 10 times longer than those without. The Boerum, a 20-story condominium at 265 State Street in Brooklyn, won't be finished until late this year. But at the showroom of the developer and designer, Flank, brokers pull up renderings of specific apartments on a large-screen TV, using an iPad to move around. They can even take potential buyers over to the window to see the exact view, captured via drone. Buyers will know, for example, if their view might be blocked by another building.

""Imagine that you're sending a check for $30 million and you have nothing to see,"" Mr. Navarro said. ""Our work is the closest you can get without having to build it. You feel the size. You get the textures."" His drones don't just take photos but also capture video. So if there's a lot of street noise, ""I can't lie to you,"" he said. The virtual apartments created by Mr. Navarro cost nearly $100,000 to make and take months to build. They can be viewed with an Oculus headset, Mr. Navarro said, but most clients don't use this option. When presenting images of the 54-story Turnberry Ocean Club Residences in Sunny Isles Beach, Fla., to the developer, Turnberry Associates, Mr. Navarro used a giant video wall to let the company's executives virtually walk around the building without goggles. ""We didn't want the guy coming to write a $70 million check to get dizzy on us,"" he said. Jeffrey Hummel, the chief technology officer of Douglas Elliman, said that while virtual reality has a certain ""wow"" factor, as with any new technology, there are lessons to be learned. In his previous career as a financial services executive, Mr. Hummel gave his programming team pairs of Google Glass to test. ""We had an outbreak of pink eye among all those people,"" he said.

A quick fix for this, of course, is the Google cardboard headset, which typically costs less than $10. Randy Baruh, an associate broker for Corcoran, ordered a handful of these headsets and is planning to have them branded with his contact information and the Corcoran logo. He said he would distribute them at open houses along with his show sheets. (A quick response code on the sheet will start the VR app.) He has contracted with ProMedia, a New York-based production company, to create a few VR-capable listings. ""It's a way to set homes apart in this hypercompetitive environment,"" he said. Mr. Leone of Halstead says virtual reality could eventually eliminate the need for open houses. ""If you can see the homes remotely and be more educated before you actually make a trip, you'll make the process easier,"" he said. At Douglas Elliman, Mr. Hummel said it would be better to put large-screen curved TVs in select offices until the headset technology ""comes of age."" He says the goggles might be better suited to international buyers so they can evaluate a property ""before taking an expensive plane ride.""","The technology is expected to transform the real estate industry, and, many say, make house-hunting more efficient.",42dfeff9-0d00-5641-affd-32c2bbc471eb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/realestate/14VIRTUALJP1/14VIRTUALJP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=826bd10041a2e68127aeaea9fa2be1ce800f44759630c942e62cbfc84883f4fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ellie Wald, an agent at Halstead Property, dons a Samsung Gear headset at the brokerage firm's Manhattan headquarters.",42dfeff9-0d00-5641-affd-32c2bbc471eb,N24News/imgs/42dfeff9-0d00-5641-affd-32c2bbc471eb.jpg,7
Theater,"René Buch, a Force in Spanish-Language Repertory Theater, Dies at 94",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/theater/rene-buch-dead.html,"Rene Buch, a founder of Repertorio Espanol, in an undated photo. He was passionate about repertory theater and favored spare sets because, an associate explained, ""He didn't want the audience to be distracted by other things.""



Rene Buch, a co-founder and the artistic director of Repertorio Espanol, a repertory theater in Manhattan devoted to presenting Spanish-language works in a city that was increasingly Spanish-speaking, died on April 19 at his home in Manhattan. He was 94. Robert Federico, the theater's executive producer, said the cause was respiratory failure. Since 1968, Repertorio Espanol has reimagined Spanish classics and offered contemporary work by Latin and Latin American playwrights, always in Spanish, performed repertory-style -- a rare phenomenon in this country. Maintaining a repertory theater, with a nearly permanent corps of actors performing a different work every night and at matinees, is a financial and artistic challenge. But Mr. Buch was always passionate about the form. And he liked to say that the playwrights of the Spanish Golden Age -- Cervantes et al. -- should be as well known here as Shakespeare. In the beginning, he kept the operation afloat with a day job as a Spanish-language copywriter at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency, while his co-founder, Gilberto Zaldivar, who like Mr. Buch was born in Cuba, was an executive at Diners Club, the credit card company.

At Repertorio Espanol, Mr. Buch, along with Mr. Zaldivar, who died in 2009, and Mr. Federico, who joined the company in 1972, put on plays by Federico Garcia Lorca and Pedro Calderon de la Barca; adapted novels by Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Mario Vargas Llosa; and presented new works by playwrights like Eduardo Machado, Carmen Rivera and Nilo Cruz, who in 2003 won the Pulitzer Prize for drama for ""Anna in the Tropics,"" which Mr. Buch adapted in Spanish for his troupe the next year. The company's home was the Gramercy Arts Theater, a 140-seat mid-19th-century wooden townhouse on East 27th Street -- the city's tiniest theater, The New York Times declared in 1915.

Mr. Cruz remembered hearing Mr. Buch speak when he was a student at Miami Dade College. (Mr. Buch had come to Miami to lecture at the Hispanic Theater Festival.) ""He talked about rhythm on the stage, and not rushing the language. It stuck with me,"" Mr. Cruz said in an interview. ""His sensibility was very European in the sense that the mise-en-scene was important: just space and the actor in space. When he did 'Anna,' there were only three chairs."" Mr. Buch's signature was those lean sets. ""He didn't want the audience to be distracted by other things,"" Mr. Federico said. ""He was like a dance choreographer in that way.""

""La Gringa,"" Carmen Rivera's play about a young New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent who finds herself an outsider when she visits her ""homeland,"" opened at Mr. Buch's theater in 1996 and promptly won an Obie. Twenty-four years later, it is still there (or was, until the recent lockdown), the longest-running Spanish-language play Off Broadway. Ms. Rivera said her collaboration with Mr. Buch, a compact man with a deep baritone, changed the way she conceived her work. ""They say writers write, and directors interpret,"" she said in an interview, ""but he really delved into the play. He was a story excavator.""

The Cuban-born playwright Eduardo Machado, who came to the United States when he was 8 and who, like Mr. Cruz and Ms. Rivera, writes in English, said: ""Rene taught me Spanish literature. He taught me where I really came from. He made me more Cuban. ""When he directed my play 'The Modern Ladies of Guanabacoa,'"" he added, ""the actors were doing it like it was Chekhov. Rene said to them, 'Why are you thinking before you speak? Cubans don't do that.'"" In 1998, Repertorio Espanol took Mr. Machado's play ""Broken Eggs"" to Cuba, part of a cultural exchange between the countries. It was a deeply emotional experience for the troupe; seven of the performers were Cuban. Rene Buch was born on Dec. 19, 1925, in Santiago, Cuba. His father, Ernesto Buch, was a lawyer; his mother, Dolores Santos, was a homemaker and pianist.

He entered college at 15 -- his father had altered his records to make him appear a year older, then the legal age for enrollment in Cuba, Mr. Federico said, so all of Mr. Buch's documents, including his passport, retained the incorrect birth date. He received a doctorate in law from the University of Havana in 1948. Fidel Castro, Mr. Buch said, was there at the same time, and had a habit of wearing a gun and holster to class. He thought he wanted to be an opera composer (his father had told him if he went to law school first, he could do anything he wanted afterward), but he fell in love with the theater, particularly repertory theater, when the French director Louis Jouvet took his company to Latin America and Cuba during World War II. At 20, Mr. Buch won a prize in a national playwriting competition. Mr. Buch received an M.F.A. in playwriting from Yale in 1952 -- though he chafed at what he called the school's ""academic theater"" -- and then moved to New York City, where he worked in journalism and advertising.","As a founder of the venerable Manhattan company Repertorio Español, Mr. Buch reimagined works both classic and contemporary.",b9249c03-2576-536f-a46e-88cc775be99e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/23/obituaries/23Buch-obit3/18Buch3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=381&w=729&s=a9623f54872dde6895be13215cda97084eee236b7479d585c1787bd517fe0300&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ren&eacute; Buch, a founder of Repertorio Espa&ntilde;ol, in an undated photo.

Travel,36 Hours in Dublin,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/26/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-dublin.html,"A lively, cosmopolitan and walkable city, Dublin is a perennial favorite but there are more reasons to come here now than ever before. Immigrant influence -- from Chinese dumpling restaurants to Polish grocery stores -- has added color and variety to an already vibrant culture of Irish food, crafts and booze. Dip into James Joyce's ""Ulysses"" notebooks at the new Museum of Literature Ireland and then relax with a glass of natural wine; shop for modern Irish linen and locally roasted espresso; and follow an into-the-wee hours traditional music session with a next-morning shakshuka (a tomato and egg dish from the Middle East) breakfas t. Irish art has always leaned heavily on tragedy, and Dublin's historic cemeteries and jails are worth visiting for enlightenment into what has fueled the country's often-melancholy nature. But it's the local sense of humor -- occasionally dark as it can be -- that's what most visitors take away from a visit to the capital.

The imposing Kilmainham Gaol (EUR8, or about $8.85, for the tour, which is the only way to view the site; best to book in advance) has been a tourist attraction for a surprisingly long time: since 1966, when the jail was reopened after years of restoration by a hard-working group of volunteers. The hourlong tour of the cells and stone-breakers yard, where the leaders of the 1 916 Easter Rising  -- an armed insurrection against British rule -- were executed, demonstrates the grim role the prison has played in Ireland's history. It housed rebels arrested during every uprising against British rule, and was a holding place for convicts awaiting deportation to Australia. The tour ends in an informative museum, which lays out details of the Easter Rising, War of Independence and Civil War. If certain aspects of the prison look familiar, it might be because scenes from the movies ""In The Name Of The Father"" and ""Michael Collins"" were shot here.

You can smell the Teeling Whiskey Distillery well before you can see it. The first new distillery to open in Ireland in 125 years, it's located in The Liberties, a neighborhood accustomed to the smell of barley and hops, because, in the 19th century, it was home to dozens of distilleries and breweries. Teeling's hourlong tour (starting at EUR17 per person; includes a tasting) details the long history of Irish whiskey-making and takes you through the working distillery, where you can watch the ""wort"" fermenting in wooden fermenters, and whiskey being distilled in giant wooden stills. The tour ends in the bar, where the guide leads you through a tasting of single grain, small batch and single malt whiskeys.

In the green heart of the city's south side, lively St. Stephen's Green, you'll find students lounging on the lawns, tourists feeding the pigeons, and office workers taking a break. Stroll around the ponds and flowers, stopping in the northeast corner to see the tribute to Wolfe Tone, an 18th-century revolutionary considered the father of Irish republicanism. Note the slabs of stone lined up behind his statue; Dubliners, who love to nickname public monuments, have dubbed it Tonehenge. Stroll down Dawson Street toward an aperitif at Peruke & Periwig, a cozy and atmospherically lit bar. Chatty bartenders whip up some of the city's best cocktails (around EUR13 each) with spiced gin, local whiskey and enhancements like apple-wood smoke. The cozy second floor, with its velvet chairs, oil paintings and windows looking down onto the bustling street, is an excellent place to sequester yourself for an hour or two. Book ahead for dinner at Clanbrassil House, where the chef Grainne O'Keefe brings a new approach to old ideas in dishes like Killary Fjord mussels from the west of Ireland, bathed in a spicy XO broth, and smoked trout layered onto charred sourdough and topped with pickled cabbage. This small restaurant opened in 2018 and serves some of the most innovative plates in Dublin: sausage made in house from pork cheeks; marmalade ice cream; and hash brown fries with an onion mayonnaise. Interesting, Eurocentric wines are served by the glass, and the family-style option, in which the kitchen sends out a range of small plates, starters, mains and desserts, is a fun way to snack around the tempting menu. Dinner runs around EUR120 for two, including wine.

When you just can't face another Irish fry, grab an early brunch (around EUR30 for two) at Brother Hubbard South, which has one of the most inventive breakfast menus in the city. Middle East-inflected dishes like a crispy halloumi sandwich with pickled tomatoes, or Turkish eggs with whipped feta, are made with ingredients from local producers, and the coffee is roasted on-site. They even make their own cola. Despite rave reviews, it remains unpretentious and welcoming, and the large patio is a popular spot for al fresco breakfasts when the weather is up to it.

Leopold Bloom, perhaps the most famous character in Irish literature, makes a visit to Sweny's Pharmacy in James Joyce's ""Ulysses,"" where he purchases a bar of ""sweet lemony wax"" soap that accompanies him around the city. The same soap is still on sale (EUR5) in this pharmacy, now a small, tchotchke-filled museum run by volunteers who happily discourse on Joyce, and hold daily readings and discussion groups on the author's works. Saturdays between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. are for the ""Ulysses"" reading, which anyone is welcome to come in and enjoy -- or contribute. The pharmacy (in business from 1853 to 2009), with its wooden fittings and dusty bottles looks, one imagines, exactly the same as it did in Joyce's day.

A short stroll from the museum are two studios showcasing modern Irish workmanship. Jennifer Slattery Textiles' Irish linens are embroidered with care and whimsy, with items like finely woven napkins (EUR78 for four) adorned with a tiny knife and fork. Thin, brightly colored trays (EUR45 each) of embroidered linen brushed with resin, make fabulous gifts. Next door, Flock Studio sells toy sheep, mice and other animals, made with Irish wools and merino that's been turned into felt by hand. A 10-minute walk brings you to Arran Street East, a small corner studio, cafe and shop that makes its own beautifully glazed range of small cups, pitchers and plant pots, all in muted primary colors. They run workshops (starting at EUR50) as well, if you want to try your hand at the wheel.

The Dublin 7 neighborhood is home to an increasing number of excellent restaurants that are well off the tourist trail. Stop on Benburb Street and hop onto a high stool at Fish Shop, where the catch of the day (sustainably fished) becomes a truly excellent battered fish and chips (lunch for two, around EUR40). There's a selection of natural, organic and biodynamic wines by the glass. Follow lunch with a ""Night and Day"" at Proper Order, a cheerfully staffed coffee shop with beans from esoteric European roasters like Square Mile and Fried Hats. The ""Night and Day"" (EUR4.50) is a pair of espresso shots, one black and one with milk, that comprise a sort of mini tasting menu, with enough caffeine to power you through the rest of your day.

Occupying buildings ranged around the vast inner courtyard of the former Collins Army Barracks, the fabulous National Museum of Ireland -- Decorative Arts & History (free admission) is home to some of Ireland's greatest treasures. In addition to exhibits on Irish history, the galleries are home to expertly curated displays on Irish fashion through the years; a millennium of Irish coinage; a huge collection of Irish silver and much more. The signs accompanying everything from a poplin dress from the early 1900s to an iron-wrought candlestick to a chair made from straw impart incredible amounts of fascinating detail; you'll learn more than you ever expected.

L. Mulligan Grocer, in increasingly cool Stoneybatter, is the best kind of neighborhood restaurant: locally sourced ingredients, a lengthy and interesting list of local and international craft beers, and a lovingly curated whiskey list with descriptions that are almost poetic. The food, from high-end versions of Scotch eggs that feature pickled onion and Dijon mayonnaise, to delicately braised lamb with juicy carrots and a black-pudding-and-potato croquette, doesn't look far from home for inspiration, but the execution and ingredients are exemplary and have created a loyal local fan base. After washing down your Irish cheese plate with a specially paired whiskey, stroll over to the trad session in The Cobblestone, a busy pub with live fiddlers and uilleann pipers going hard every night, where you can sink a Guinness while the talented musicians do their thing.

You can learn an astonishing amount of Irish history from a general history tour (EUR13.50) of Glasnevin Cemetery, where most of Ireland's politicians, revolutionaries and luminaries are buried, including many who were jailed at Kilmainham. The efficient, well-informed guides take you to the graves of people like the revolutionaries Michael Collins and Countess Markievicz, delivering a neat summary of each person's place in history, as well as explaining the intricacies of Ireland's civil war and what happened after the Easter Rising in 1916. Following the tour, exit through the southwest corner and enter the John Kavanagh pub, colloquially known as The Gravediggers, for a pint where (apocryphally) the cemetery workers used to refresh themselves during particularly long wakes. While away your afternoon snacking around Eatyard, an open-air, gravel-floored courtyard with food stalls selling everything from wings dipped in sauces flavored with Irish whiskey to vegan fish and chips (made with a plant-based meat substitute) to locally made ice cream. The space also plays host to playful events like potato chip festivals (complete with impassioned debates on the best flavors). Eatyard officially closes in the winter, though it opens frequently for special events. If it's shut, settle in next door at the Bernard Shaw, a cheerfully ramshackle pub with a tendency to play world music all day long, for a hemp ale or an I.P.A. brewed by the owners as well as a good selection of other locally brewed beers and high end Irish gins. Dublin's easy to get around, but staying near the city center will save shoe leather: Look for rentals in ZIP codes D1 and D2. One-bedroom apartments rented through Airbnb cost around $120 a night; more in summer and less in winter. The chic Iveagh Garden Hotel (doubles from EUR180) has rooms in a range of sizes, decked out in green and blue velvet accents and with generous bathrooms. The hotel backs onto the lush Iveagh Gardens and is walking distance from many city sights.","A vibrant culture of Irish food, crafts, booze, literature and music offers a weekend of diversions, but it's Dublin's complex history and its welcoming spirit that will linger longest.",63dc76a5-0879-5843-95c4-6a6b60760de1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/26/travel/26Hours-Dublin2/26Hours-Dublin2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1fdcf384a6ca9e17becdfc1719d680216160473cca6a00f904b73b2c6e6c847d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The National Museum of Ireland-Decorative Arts & History features some of the country's greatest treasures, with displays on historical events, fashion, furnishings, Irish design and more.",63dc76a5-0879-5843-95c4-6a6b60760de1,N24News/imgs/63dc76a5-0879-5843-95c4-6a6b60760de1.jpg,4
Books,How Sweet It Is. And How Malignant.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/23/books/review/james-walvin-sugar.html,"Sweets have invaded the English language the way they have invaded our diet, with almost universally positive connotations. Sweet love, sweet people and sweet deals all suggest pleasant experiences, as do the sugary confections that grace our tables and fill our stores. 's new book, ""Sugar: The World Corrupted: From Slavery to Obesity,"" will thoroughly disabuse you of such agreeable associations and may make you reluctant to reach for something sweet. Sugar, he shows, is a blood-soaked product that has brought havoc to millions and environmental devastation to large parts of the planet, premature death to the poorest populations in many parts of the world and huge health costs for societies from the United States to India. After reading this book the mere mention of sugar should make you think of slavery and cavities, imperialism and obesity -- and remind you to check the label on the products you consume.

Walvin, the author of several books on slavery, takes his readers on a roller-coaster ride through 500 years of history. Sugar, he shows, was rare for most of human history, with sweetness largely derived from fruits and honey. Sugar was believed to have healing properties and in much of the world it was dispensed by apothecaries; consumption of small quantities of sugar was the prerogative of elites. Then, in the 16th century, Europeans seized large territories in the Americas and quickly dedicated much of that acreage to sugar cane. By killing off local inhabitants and enslaving Africans to do the backbreaking labor of tending the sugar plant, European settlers managed to build a huge production complex. Hungry for power and profit, they turned the fertile soils of Brazil, Barbados, Guadeloupe, Jamaica, St. Domingue and other places to the growing of sugar for European markets by slave labor, producing extraordinary wealth in cities like Bristol, Bordeaux and Boston, and unimaginable misery for millions of enslaved workers.

Sugar, Walvin argues, was the cutting edge of global capitalism, with the plantations among the largest business enterprises, the most significant sources of profit and, in light of their highly regimented discipline, the most modern work sites. As a major share of the total trade of both 18th-century France and Britain, sugar lubricated the world economy and provided nutrition to the growing number of people who worked in cities and industry. Sugar catalyzed some of the first waves of globalization -- notably in British North America, which entered the world economy as a supplier of goods to the Caribbean sugar complex and a processor of its harvest. Boston, as much as Barbados, is sugar's offspring.

As sugar streamed from the Caribbean, consumption grew. The European elite consumed ever-larger quantities -- their rotting teeth in full view of their contemporaries, although discreetly hidden by their portraitists. By the 19th century, the working class in Europe and North America was sweetening its tea and coffee, and putting jam on its toast; by century's end, it was breakfasting on sugary cereals. Fantastic quantities of sugar, in all its forms, kept stomachs full and workers productive. In 1770, rum -- made from sugar cane -- provided possibly one-quarter of the caloric needs of British North America. By the mid-20th century, the average annual consumption of sugar in Britain was an astonishing 110 pounds per person. ""The fruits of slave labor,"" Walvin writes, ""had thoroughly permeated the Western world."" Even with slavery abolished in the British and French Caribbean, North Atlantic demand and investments allowed for another huge expansion of sugar slavery, this time in Cuba.","James Walvin's ""Sugar: The World Corrupted: From Slavery to Obesity"" describes the problems with an all-too-familiar commodity.",84fd95c4-eb7a-579c-aae3-f961e1e1d71f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/24/books/review/00Beckert1/00Beckert1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=517&w=987&s=bbf7a694575b724948a35bfd553b3a4b1a477ed1f80e041df0232591fa8bad80&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,James Walvin,84fd95c4-eb7a-579c-aae3-f961e1e1d71f,N24News/imgs/84fd95c4-eb7a-579c-aae3-f961e1e1d71f.jpg,13

Health,Coronavirus May Add Billions to U.S. Health Care Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/health/coronavirus-insurance-premium-increases.html,"With so much still uncertain about how widespread hospitalizations for coronavirus patients will be around the United States, a new analysis says premiums could increase as much as 40 percent next year if the pandemic results in millions of Americans needing hospital stays. ""Health plans went into 2020 with no hint of coronavirus on the horizon,"" said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of Covered California, the state insurance marketplace created under the Affordable Care Act, which conducted the analysis. To protect businesses and individuals from sharply higher rates, he supports a temporary federal program that would cover some of these costs. ""No insurer, no state, planned and put money away for something of this significance,"" Mr. Lee said. So far, some 94,000 people have become infected in the United States, according to official counts, and at least 1,400 have died. In New York state alone, nearly 1,600 patients were in intensive-care units as of Friday morning and the numbers have been rising all week.

Mr. Lee's organization estimated the total cost to the commercial insurance market, which represents the coverage currently offered to 170 million workers and individuals through private health plans. The analysis does not include costs for people enrolled in government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. Depending on how many people need care, insurers, employers and individuals could face anywhere from $34 billion to $251 billion in additional expenses from the testing and treatment of Covid-19. according to the analysis. At the high end, the virus would add 20 percent or more to current costs of roughly $1.2 trillion a year. ""There's a lot we don't know,"" Mr. Lee said. ""These are ranges."" While the bill before Congress would provide hospitals some financial relief, it may not result in any change to how much hospitals charge private insurers and employers for care, he said. Insurers and employers are already prodding Congress to consider helping them pay for the crisis by setting up a special reinsurance program that would cover the most expensive medical claims. The federal government would fund the program to lower the amount being paid by employers and insurers. While insurers have enjoyed strong profits in recent years, they say the cost of the pandemic could be overwhelming, especially to employers and workers already struggling to pay for coverage.

Employers and others have launched a new group, the Alliance to Fight for Health Care, that includes many of the same parties that worked together to defeat the enactment of the so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer plans. They, too, recently told lawmakers they think a federal reinsurance program might make sense. Without help lowering their costs by having the government pay for the most expensive hospital stays, Mr. Lee warned that insurers are likely to seek rates that are double their additional costs from the virus. If their costs go up 20 percent, Mr. Lee says rates could jump as much as 40 percent in 2021. ""These increased costs could mean that many of the 170 million Americans in the commercial market may lose their coverage and go without needed care as we battle a global health crisis,"" Lee said in a statement, outlining his group's proposals. While state government insurance officials may push back, they may be inclined to allow the increases if they believe companies would need the additional revenue to pay medical claims. ""Regulators would take a sharp eye to big premium increases,"" said John Bertko, Covered California's chief actuary, but if insurers ""chew up half or more of their solvency reserves, regulators will say they need to build them up."" The group warned that smaller insurers could be especially at risk. Rate increase requests still might be difficult for some states and consumers to swallow. The nation's largest insurers, which include giant for-profit companies like Anthem, CVS Health and UnitedHealth, reported billions of dollars in profits last year, and analysts say these companies have abundant capital to absorb any losses because of the pandemic. Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act, health care inflation has remained in the single digits.

Increases in medical costs of 3 to 4 percent ""would be manageable by most insurers,"" concluded a recent analysts at S&P Global Ratings. If costs were to go up by 10 to 12 percent, the analysts say the stress on the companies would be greater, with insurers reporting losses and forced to use their capital reserves to pay claims. But some actuaries are predicting costs are likely to be much lower. One actuary said insurers have told him that they have no plans to raise rates sharply because the do not think the pandemic will change their predictions about ongoing medical expenses once it has run its course. And other actuaries are coming up with estimates that are lower because they have different assumptions about how many people might be hospitalized and whether that would be offset by the declines in medical care for other illnesses or surgeries as people stay home and elective procedures are postponed indefinitely. The cost of the epidemic could be tempered if people don't seek other kinds of care, like a routine check up or hip replacement. That also happened during the 2008 recession, when people postponed any type of care and procedures. ""We think claims are really going to drop off over the next month or two,"" said Edward Kaplan, a senior vice president at Segal, which advises clients on their health benefits. He thinks his clients in New York, which is being particularly hard hit by the virus, could see additional costs of 4 to 5 percent. In other areas, if there are many fewer cases, costs could be less. Another big unknown is whether people will be able to get treatment for Covid-19 or other illnesses, in spite of needing care. Depending on the course of the pandemic, health systems could become so overwhelmed that they have no available hospital beds or staff to treat patients who would otherwise receive care. If patients can't get care, overall costs could be much lower than they would otherwise be, said Trevis Parson, chief actuary for Willis Towers Watson, which advises companies on benefits. His group is estimating costs could increase by as much as 7 percent because of the pandemic. Even then, how much the private sector will pay is unclear, especially if the government starts setting up hospital beds and temporary hospitals in various regions, and supplying staff to treat patients.","Insurance premiums could spike as much as 40 percent next year, a new analysis warns, as employers and insurers confront the projected tens of billions of dollars in additional costs of treating coronavirus patients.",cc833f42-b3c2-5fa7-809c-849abac348a4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/27/science/27VIRUS-INSURE1/27VIRUS-INSURE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=e454325d4311dd4b6b46056a9449fb0cbb94e1887b79c85acc4da450f17bc4b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Doctors tested hospital staff for coronavirus in tents at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx on Tuesday.,cc833f42-b3c2-5fa7-809c-849abac348a4,N24News/imgs/cc833f42-b3c2-5fa7-809c-849abac348a4.jpg,1
Art & Design,'LOVE' and Other Four-Letter Words,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/arts/design/robert-indiana-love-and-other-four-letter-words.html,"For her 2000 book ""Robert Indiana: Figures of Speech,"" Susan Elizabeth Ryan, a Louisiana State University art history professor, spent considerable time interviewing the artist and digging into his process. She writes that ""LOVE"" began in late 1964 as a more explicit four-letter word -- beginning with F, and with a second letter, a U, intriguingly tilted to the right. In the wake of a messy breakup with his on-again, off-again romantic partner and fellow artist Ellsworth Kelly, Mr. Indiana had been focusing on word paintings. The two men were in the habit of exchanging postcard-size sketches, with Mr. Kelly laying down fields of color and Mr. Indiana adding large words atop the abstractions.

""For Ellsworth it was like a joke,"" explained Ms. Ryan, one that Mr. Kelly took as a provocation. Moreover, as a devout abstractionist, she said, ""Ellsworth was horrified by the idea of having words in a painting. And the more he got like that, the more Robert wanted to take it seriously. During the era of post-painterly abstraction, just the fact that it was a word -- any word -- was subversive.""

The word in question was certainly in the air as a pointedly political gesture within the circles Mr. Indiana followed -- from Ed Sanders' similarly titled mimeographed poetry magazine to Lenny Bruce's controversy-sparking performances.

Yet by December of that year, Mr. Indiana had shifted his artwork's four letters to LOVE, using it for a set of handmade Christmas cards he mailed out to friends and shelving its blunter precursor. The director of the Museum of Modern Art saw one of the cards and asked Mr. Indiana to do a mass-produced version for the museum's gift shop. By the end of 1965, MoMA's ""LOVE"" card was a best-seller and unauthorized knockoffs were already appearing, including aluminum ""LOVE"" paperweights from the city of brotherly love, Philadelphia. Mr. Indiana doubled down, licensing his own ""LOVE"" jewelry, working on variants in painting form, and eventually moving off the canvas into three-dimensional versions.

This G-rated linguistic alteration wasn't borne out of either self-censorship or marketing, said Barbara Haskell, a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the organizer of its 2013 retrospective, ""Robert Indiana: Beyond Love."" She ascribed it to Mr. Indiana's canny aesthetic instincts, at least circa 1964: ""Love has a bit more nuance to it than"" its cruder four-letter cousin. That latter word ""is a one-dimensional verb. It's too flat-footed, it doesn't leave anything to the imagination."" By contrast, ""love is such a timeless, universal concept. Yet his graphic portrayal of it identified, on the one hand, a punchy affirmation of the term, and on the other hand, very deep feelings of fear. He saw it as a precarious image that came out of his disappointments in love -- that tilted O suggests the instability of relationships.""","Somewhere in Robert Indiana's home in Maine, there may exist an early version of his famous image — one that will startle his fans.",12ed9f82-e2f8-5f0e-987b-3fb9b17d96ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/24/arts/24love/24indiana-art1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=5370e18e3600c617beb99d16db18afebfcdd3999792b83a60a9f98db482bcab0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Robert Indiana with a &ldquo;LOVE&rdquo; painting at his Coenties Slip studio in the 1960s.,12ed9f82-e2f8-5f0e-987b-3fb9b17d96ff,N24News/imgs/12ed9f82-e2f8-5f0e-987b-3fb9b17d96ff.jpg,14
Education,"In Chicago, Campaign to Provide Safe Passage on Way to School",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/education/in-chicago-campaign-to-provide-safe-passage-on-way-to-school.html,"CHICAGO -- The first day of school in one neighborhood on this city's far South Side brought a parade of security workers in neon vests, police officers on patrol, an idling city fire truck and, briefly, a police helicopter hovering above. All this to make sure that students from a shuttered elementary school could make it safely past abandoned lots, boarded-up houses and gang territory to get to their new school less than a half-mile away. And to some parents that did not seem like enough. ""It's still really too dangerous,"" said Larissa Henderson as she walked her 4-year-old son, Adrian Wright, to his first day of kindergarten. When Chicago leaders announced last spring that they would close 47 elementary schools this fall, the move stirred worries far beyond education. Many parents feared it would require some children, particularly those on the city's poorer South and West Sides, to walk down more crime-ridden blocks and across ever-changing gang boundaries. Ms. Henderson and Adrian were headed to Curtis Elementary School on Monday, which some neighborhood residents said had a long history of tension and fighting with the school that closed, Songhai. ""I don't know if my baby has a chance out here,"" Ms. Henderson said, adding that even Adrian had witnessed a shooting on a street nearby a few months ago.

While many cities have programs to help children get to and from school safely, experts said few appear to be as elaborate and comprehensive as Chicago's -- a fact that advocates held up as proof of the city's intense commitment to education and critics described as an unhappy reflection of the city's struggle with violence. Known as Safe Passage, Chicago's program began after the beating death in 2009 of a 16-year-old student, Derrion Albert, after he left his South Side high school one afternoon. But with the closing of so many schools, city officials say the number of routes has more than doubled this year and the cost of the program has also nearly doubled, to $15.7 million. By Monday, along the Safe Passage routes, some 1,200 unarmed workers, wearing neon vests, carrying cellphones that doubled as walkie-talkies and making $10 an hour, had been trained to stand watch as students passed by. To prepare, city employees in recent weeks demolished 41 vacant buildings along the routes, trimmed 4,900 trees, removed 2,800 instances of graffiti and fixed hundreds of streetlights.

""The ultimate goal of all efforts -- both in the building, on the way to the building and at home -- is so kids will think about their studies, not their safety,"" Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who spent part of the morning along Safe Passage routes around the city, said later in an interview. ""The city is diverse. This isn't everywhere. But it does address certain parts of the city and certain communities so every child has a level playing field."" In 2012, more than 500 people were killed in Chicago, drawing national attention to hundreds of gangs and the gun violence that has flourished in some neighborhoods. The killings have decreased since then; 266 people have been killed here this year as of Sunday, the police said, a drop of about 26 percent compared with a year ago, and seven fewer homicides than this time in 2011. While Chicago Public Schools officials had said that the closings, which are expected to save $43 million in operations costs this year, were needed because the schools had too few students, opponents worried about safety.

""I hope they'll be safe and I want them to be safe, but I don't know if this is enough,"" said Inez Jackson, whose said her daughter, a third grader, wept when Songhai closed. City officials said that safety had improved significantly along the existing Safe Passage routes, reporting that crime had dropped by 20 percent on the routes over the last two years while school attendance had improved. The police said no incidents were reported on Monday along the city's 92 Safe Passage routes. Still, some parents said they were skeptical that the program would truly last beyond a few days or a few weeks, and pointed to shootings, deaths and fights that have plagued some of the city's roughest neighborhoods.

Early Sunday, a 14-year-old boy was shot to death in a vacant lot about a block from a West Side school near what would, a day later, be considered a Safe Passage route. Early Monday, in a South Side alley not far from a Safe Passage route, the body of an adult was found in a garbage can by sanitation workers; the police said the death, which had apparently happened the night before, was being investigated. Around Ms. Jackson's neighborhood, residents said the school cuts -- and the notion of merging schools -- carried special worries. Some recalled fights and old disputes between students from Curtis and Songhai, including one altercation, residents said, that involved baseball bats more than a decade ago. Others said they were taken aback Monday by the heavy police presence, and the signal that seemed to send to new students on their first day at Curtis. ""This is a zoo,"" said Shay Moore, who was trying to sort out where her boys, a second grader and a fourth grader, were supposed to go. ""Everybody told me I don't want to bring them here, but I've got no choice. They've got all these police here but no one knows where the kids are supposed to go."" But Harold Davis, the director of an agency that hired 14 Safe Passage workers to stand on the blocks near Curtis, said families from both schools had been holding meetings, working out old disputes. ""This is the kind of place where you once had adults telling the kids not to play with each other,"" Mr. Davis said. ""This community has to heal.""","With concern that children would have to traverse crime-ridden blocks after the closing of 47 schools, the city deployed about 1,200 workers to watch over them.",8b060c81-7216-5d0f-9a5f-20ffc3617783,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/27/us/CHICAGO-1/CHICAGO-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=410&w=600&s=8a68669103906d0fa4f4a2ac551922b594ef8189308614f1f5a50d0c97b57a2d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Members of Chicago's Safe Passage program stood watch as children made their way to school on Monday, the first day of classes.",8b060c81-7216-5d0f-9a5f-20ffc3617783,N24News/imgs/8b060c81-7216-5d0f-9a5f-20ffc3617783.jpg,22
Sports,Fear the Beard Sweat: These N.B.A. Workers Keep the Court Dry,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/sports/basketball/nba-sweat-mop.html,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- In the opening game of the N.B.A. finals last week, LeBron James of the Los Angeles Lakers toppled to the court after drawing a foul. As soon as he went down, two people wielding large towels sprang into action from behind the basket. They had one job, and it was a vital one: mop up James's sweat. In the two-plus months since the league restarted its season at Walt Disney World, the games have been absent a few of their usual components: fans and halftime performers, dance crews and mascots. The focus, as a result, is almost solely on the players -- and, on occasion, the team attendants who share the court with them. The spotlight has never burned brighter. ""The whole world,"" Mario Casamajor said, ""is waiting for me to clean up this wet spot."" The players seem to recognize the importance of team attendants like Casamajor, 28, and their varied duties inside the league's bubble. The attendants load and unload gear. They help set up the bench areas. They rebound during warm-ups and at halftime. But nothing they do is of greater consequence than the work they do with their towels and mops. Basketball is a sweaty business, and a wet court is a dangerous court. ""That's a series-altering incident if someone slips and tweaks something,"" Miami Heat forward Duncan Robinson said. ""In many ways, they're the unsung heroes of this whole thing.""

""You have your guys who you know are going to sweat,"" said Casamajor, who recently worked as a basketball operations associate for the Iowa Wolves of the N.B.A.'s developmental league. Among them: Jae Crowder, a forward for the Heat who invites contact, draws charges and makes a big mess. ""After every game,"" Crowder said, ""I tell those guys: 'Thank you. Thank you for wiping up all that sweat.'""

The league has put even greater emphasis on the court conditions as a part of the safety protocols initiated by the coronavirus pandemic. Three attendants are positioned behind each baseline during games (as opposed to one or two in nonpandemic times). They wear masks and gloves. They are ready for the joys that await them. Ellis Dawson, 50, an assistant director for basketball operations with the United States national teams, helped recruit a group of 56 attendants to the restart to rotate among the teams. Only 10 remain. The attendants have been in the bubble for nearly 90 days -- ""Eighty-two,"" Casamajor said last week, not that he was counting -- as they assist the players, make connections and gain experience. ""You're one of 300 people at the N.B.A. finals,"" Dawson said. ""It's pretty unbelievable."" During games, the attendants have three tools at their disposal. They use large brooms to clean the entire court during timeouts and between quarters. They use small circular ""sweat mops"" -- which happen to retail for $352 for a set of two -- to make a quick run around the lane after free throws. And they get on their hands and knees with oversize bath towels whenever a player falls down. (The towels, Dawson said, are ""more absorbent."")

""I guess the hard part about it is that it's a streak and not a puddle,"" Casamajor said, ""so you have to make sure you fully track it all the way, especially if a guy slid."" A New York Times analysis of a recent game between the Heat and the Boston Celtics in the Eastern Conference finals revealed that the attendants took the court a total of 76 times -- including 42 times when live game action was happening at the other end. In those instances, the attendants averaged about eight seconds per cleaning sequence. ""Just get it done,"" said Anthony Kresse, 23, a team attendant who is on loan from the Milwaukee Bucks, ""and be quick about it so you don't get run over.""

It takes teamwork. If one attendant is furiously addressing some form of sweat spillage or drippage, the others are keeping an eye on the players in case there is a turnover or a quick shot that will send players dashing back to their end of the court. ""We usually just shout, 'Run!'"" said Alexis Besinaiz, 27, a former director of basketball operations for the women's team at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. There have been no reported collisions. They are also observant. Some players perspire more than others. Whenever Joel Embiid of the Philadelphia 76ers or Khris Middleton of the Bucks attempted free throws, the attendants knew to take special care with their moisture abatement techniques. Others with ample drippage: ""The guys with beards a lot of the time,"" Casamajor said.

The Eastern Conference semifinal series between the Celtics and the Toronto Raptors was particularly intense, with bodies splayed across the court on many possessions. As a result, the attendants were on high alert, especially when Marcus Smart was in the lineup for Boston. ""You know Marcus Smart is going to be on the floor,"" Casamajor said. ""So you almost need to track him because he's going to dive for every loose ball."" If Casamajor is on cleanup duty, he wears calf-length tights under his shorts so that he can easily maneuver around on the court from his knees. He also wears a fitness tracker.

""You just know you're going to hit your activity goal,"" he said. In addition to the six attendants who patrol the baselines, four others are assigned to either team's bench area to help with anything the players need, from drinks to towels to heating pads. For the Lakers, James and Danny Green use specific types of tissues to wipe their faces during timeouts. James, Casamajor said, favors a heftier material that is more like a paper towel. Mike Mancias, James's longtime trainer and a member of the Lakers' staff, ensures that he is well supplied. Green's tissue situation is more complicated. ""You're always trying to track it down,"" Casamajor said. ""Like, 'Where's Danny Green's tissue box?' It's usually at his seat or someone else took it. But we want to make sure Danny Green has his tissue box for when he sits down."" Green expressed his gratitude, saying the attendants seemed ""very hard-working."" ""I appreciate cleanliness, especially these days with the virus going around,"" Green said. ""Cleanliness is next to godliness, you know.""","Dives for loose balls. Flops to draw fouls.

Television,Chris Rock Tried to Warn Us,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/arts/television/chris-rock-fargo.html,"""Everything I've done hasn't been great,"" Chris Rock said. ""But I was always striving for greatness.""Credit...Dana Scruggs for The New York Times



Chris Rock wasn't sure if he was hiding out or not. On the Friday before Labor Day, he was speaking by phone from Yellow Springs, Ohio, the rustic village where he'd gone to spend time with Dave Chappelle, his friend and fellow comedian. Rock had previously traveled there in July to perform for a small, socially distanced audience as part of an outdoor comedy series Chappelle has been hosting. But Rock couldn't decide if this return visit was meant to be clandestine. ""I don't know if it's a secret,"" he said quietly. ""Maybe it is out here."" He couldn't easily find the words to describe what he'd been doing just before this trip, either. ""I mean, I guess I've been acting,"" he said. After a short pause, he added, at a more assuredly Rock-like volume: ""In a pandemic."" In August, Rock had gone to Chicago to finish filming the fourth season of ""Fargo,"" the supremely arch FX crime drama, which makes its debut on Sept. 27. The show's creator, Noah Hawley, had chosen him to star in its latest story line, set in the dapper gangland of 1950s Kansas City, Mo., and which casts Rock -- the indefatigable standup and comic actor -- as a mannered, methodical crime lord named Loy Cannon. Maybe in a different universe where the show premiered in April as originally planned, the ""Fargo"" role has already put the 55-year-old Rock on a whole new career trajectory, opening the door to more serious and substantial roles and silencing the chorus of fans who still knowingly ask him for ""one rib."" Maybe in this universe it still will.

Other prominent projects of his have also been pushed back -- he has a starring role in ""Spiral,"" a reboot of the ""Saw"" horror series, whose release was postponed a full year to May 2021. But Rock wasn't mourning the delay of any professional gratification, having spent the spring and summer realigning his values for the new reality of pandemic life. ""Maybe for like a day or two, I was like, 'Oh, me,'"" he said with an exaggerated whimper. ""But honestly, it was more like, I've got to get to my kids and make sure my family is safe."" In that time he has also heard countless Americans echoing the lesson he offered in the opening minutes of his 2018 standup special, ""Tamborine,"" where he spoke humorously but emphatically about the ongoing incidents of police violence against Black people. As he said in that routine, law enforcement was among the professions that simply cannot allow ""a few bad apples"": ""American Airlines can't be like, 'You know, most of our pilots like to land. We just got a few bad apples that like to crash in the mountains.'"" Now Rock was feeling mistrustful about the power of his comedy to do anything other than entertain, and unsure when he would get to perform it again for large audiences. And he was admittedly wary about this very interview, explaining with a chuckle that when he talks to the print media, he said, ""You have to be comfortable with being boring. If you're not comfortable with being boring, occasionally, you're going to get in trouble."" Not that Rock was ever boring in a wide-ranging conversation that encompassed ""Fargo"" and his broader career; his latest observations on a nation grappling simultaneously with a pandemic and a reinvigorated longing for racial equality; the resurfacing of a past video where Jimmy Fallon impersonated him in blackface; and of course, President Trump. (""No one has less compassion for humans than a landlord,"" he said.) Even in the absence of an audience, Rock was candid, increasingly animated, uncommonly nimble and always looking for the laugh. Now, let the trouble begin.

How did Noah Hawley approach you about ""Fargo""? It was a weird day, because it was the day of the Emmy nominations and I didn't get nominated for my last special [""Tamborine""]. I wouldn't say I was down down, but I was a little disappointed, and then I got a call from my agent that Noah Hawley wanted to meet with me. I get acting offers, but I get more hosting offers than anything. It is not uncommon for somebody to want me to do a high-priced wedding or bar mitzvah -- a few years ago, I officiated the wedding of Daniel Ek, the owner of Spotify, and Bruno Mars was the wedding band. I think I sat next to [Mark] Zuckerberg at the reception. [Laughs.] I just assumed Noah had some crazy request like that. The only reason I went is because I love ""Fargo."" And I get there and he offers me this part. How did he explain the character of Loy Cannon to you? He said 1950s gangster, so I know exactly who he's talking about. My father was born in 1933. It's not like ""12 Years a Slave."" It's literally a guy my grandfather's age.

In the first episode, we see Loy pitching the idea for credit cards to an uninterested white banker. Is he a man who wants to be part of polite society, but it doesn't want him? I mean, I remember having a production overall deal at HBO and I came in with one person to sell a talk show with them. And they wouldn't. That person's name is Wendy Williams. [Laughs.] That's $100 million that I never made. I was selling Leslie Jones to people, to agents and managers, for 10 years before she got on ""S.N.L."" I'm very familiar with selling a no-brainer that people go, ""Huh? Why that?"" Is he different from characters you've played before, because he's older and we don't know how much longer he's going to be sitting on his throne? Yeah, it's one of those jobs: Because of how well it pays, you could be killed at any moment. It is the best part I've ever, ever, ever had. I hope it's not the best part I ever have. Hey, Morgan Freeman's done a hundred movies since ""Shawshank Redemption."" But that's the best part he ever had.

My casting isn't as weird as it seems if you really watch ""Fargo."" Key and Peele are in the first season and Brad Garrett's amazing in Season 2. Hey, it's my turn, OK? I want to work on good stuff. Everything I've done hasn't been great, but I was always striving for greatness. I loved ""Marriage Story."" I'd kill for something like that. [Laughs.] You see what [Adam] Sandler did with ""Uncut Gems."" But you've got to get the call and be ready when your number's called. Your 2014 film ""Top Five,"" which you wrote, directed and starred in, was very personal for you. Do you want to make more movies like that? That's a vein I intend to keep going in. When I made ""Top Five,"" I got divorced. And like most people that get divorced, I needed money. [Laughs.] I had to pay for stuff. I also went on tour. Because of Covid, it doesn't look like there's going to be any serious touring until 2022. So I'm a writer-director-actor right now. I'm working on some scripts in the ""Top Five"" vein and I honestly hope to direct, some time after the new year. How much of ""Fargo"" did you have to finish during the pandemic? It was like an episode and a half -- the whole last episode, and some scenes from the one before it. It's weird, quarantine when you're acting. Acting can be isolating, anyway, and then you throw quarantine into that. You're in solitary confinement with Netflix and Uber Eats. But let's not get it too twisted. Somebody that's in solitary is like, shut the [expletive] up. And then to actually act and get tested every other day, and wear a mask whenever you're not saying your lines. And be cognizant of which zone you're in. Because for Zone A, everyone's been tested, but in Zone B, not everyone's been tested. Zone C is just, everyone's got Covid.

I talked about our political whatever. America. Part of the reason we're in the predicament we're in is, the president's a landlord. No one has less compassion for humans than a landlord. [Laughs.] And we're shocked he's not engaged. Did you ever see that movie ""The Last Emperor,"" where like a 5-year-old is the emperor of China? There's a kid and he's the king. So I'm like, it's all the Democrats' fault. Because you knew that the emperor was 5 years old. And when the emperor's 5 years old, they only lead in theory. There's usually an adult who's like, ""OK, this is what we're really going to do."" And it was totally up to Pelosi and the Democrats. Their thing was, ""We're going to get him impeached,"" which was never going to happen. You let the pandemic come in. Yes, we can blame Trump, but he's really the 5-year-old. Put it this way: Republicans tell outright lies. Democrats leave out key pieces of the truth that would lead to a more nuanced argument. In a sense, it's all fake news. Looking back at the beginning of ""Tamborine,"" the first several minutes is you talking about police violence and raising Black children in a racist country. Does it feel futile when you discuss these issues and it doesn't change anything? I remember when ""Tamborine"" dropped, I got a lot of flak over that cop thing. There was a lot of people trying to start a fire that never really picked up. It's so weird that, two years later, it's right on. I remember watching the news and Trump said ""bad apples."" It was like, you did it! You did it!

But you told people two years ago -- I did. But so did Public Enemy. So did KRS-One. So did Marvin Gaye. There's something about seeing things on camera. If O.J. kills Nicole on camera, the trial is two days. [Laughs.] It's two days trying to figure out what kind of cell he deserves. It's just Johnnie going, [Johnnie Cochran voice] ""Well I think he needs at least a 12-by-8. Can he have ESPN?"" That would be the whole trial. But there was videotape of Rodney King's beating, too. It doesn't assure any particular outcome. Yeah, man. Put it this way: This is the second great civil rights movement. And Dr. King and those guys were amazing. But they knew nothing about money. They didn't ask for anything. At the end of the day, the things we got -- it was just, hey, can you guys be humane? All we got was, like, humanity. If they had it to do all over again, in hindsight, there would be some attention paid to the financial disparity of all the years of -- let's not even count slavery, let's just count Jim Crow. You're talking about a system that really didn't end until about 1973. And I'm born in '65 in South Carolina. I'm probably in a segregated wing of a hospital -- there's no way in the world I was next to a white baby. Even if the hospital wasn't segregated, I was in a whole other room and that room didn't have the good milk and the good sheets. My parents couldn't own property in certain neighborhoods when I was born. There was an economic disparity there, and that was not addressed in the original civil rights movement. It was a huge oversight. So there's no money and there's no land. If you don't have either one of those, you don't really have much. Did you want to participate in the recent protests? Me and my kids, we looked from afar. But we're in the middle of a pandemic, man, and I know people who have absolutely passed from it. I'm like, dude, this Covid thing is real.

It's real. It's not going away. I said this before, but Obama becoming the president, it's progress for white people. It's not progress for Black people. It's the Jackie Robinson thing. It's written like he broke a barrier, as if there weren't Black people that could play before him. And that's how white people have learned about racism. They think, when these people work hard enough, they'll be like Jackie. And the real narrative should be that these people, the Black people, are being abused by a group of people that are mentally handicapped. And we're trying to get them past their mental handicaps to see that all people are equal. Humanity isn't progress -- it's only progress for the person that's taking your humanity. If a woman's in an abusive relationship and her husband stops beating her, you wouldn't say she's made progress, right? But that's what we do with Black people. We're constantly told that we're making progress. The relationship we're in -- the arranged marriage that we're in -- it's that we're getting beat less. Jimmy Fallon drew significant criticism this past spring for a 20-year-old clip of himself playing you in blackface on ""Saturday Night Live."" How did you feel about that segment? Hey, man, I'm friends with Jimmy. Jimmy's a great guy. And he didn't mean anything. A lot of people want to say intention doesn't matter, but it does. And I don't think Jimmy Fallon intended to hurt me. And he didn't. There's been a wider push to expunge blackface from any movies or TV shows where it previously appeared. Have people taken it too far? If I say they are, then I'm the worst guy in the world. There's literally one answer that ends my whole career. Blackface ain't cool, OK? That's my quote. Blackface is bad. Who needs it? It's so sad, we live in a world now where you have to say, I am so against cancer. ""I just assumed you liked cancer."" No, no, no, I am so against it. You have to state so many obvious things you're against.

Who do you hang with these days? Who's your peer group? I hang with Dave [Chappelle]. I hang with my kids. I hang with Nelson George. There's not a lot of hanging in the Covid world. The better question is, who do you FaceTime with? So who do you FaceTime with? The other day I realized I've never met an elderly person that was cared for by their friends. Every elderly person I know that's got any trouble is cared for by a spouse or a child. Sometimes they have like five kids but only one helps. Where are your friends? Your friends are probably not going to be there when it really counts. [Laughs.] When my dad was dying in the hospital, where were his friends? My grandmother, where were her friends? Don't get me wrong, you get sick in your 20s, your friends will come to the hospital. It's an adventure. [Laughs.] You get sick in your 60s, they farm it out. ""You go Wednesday and I'll go Sunday."" Enjoy them while you have them. But if you think your friends are your long-term solution to loneliness, you're an idiot.","In a candid interview, the comic discusses America's summer of strife, Trump, blackface and his dramatic turn in the new season of ""Fargo.""",35ba7dee-7f89-5773-b933-0e714ae0548d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/20/arts/20CHRIS-ROCK5/20CHRIS-ROCK5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ccc532a8a3e56cba1053c8574c3f72bb841d45a871d35ab01cf158004c3b4aa7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;Everything I&rsquo;ve done hasn&rsquo;t been great,&rdquo; Chris Rock said. &ldquo;But I was always striving for greatness.&rdquo;",35ba7dee-7f89-5773-b933-0e714ae0548d,N24News/imgs/35ba7dee-7f89-5773-b933-0e714ae0548d.jpg,3
Economy,Rationing Health Care More Fairly,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/business/economy/rationing-health-care-more-fairly.html,"Older adults are understandably anxious about the political sniping over the future financing of Medicare. That is precisely the intention of the presidential campaigns. Yet the cross-fire over who will cut Medicare by how much sidesteps a critical issue about the future of our medical care: If we must ration our care to hold down costs in the future, how can we do it in a fair, efficient and transparent way? Mitt Romney's campaign was brazenly misleading in its charge that the president's health plan would cut medical services to older adults by reducing Medicare spending by $716 billion. The president's savings will come mostly from smaller payments to managed care companies, which provide the same services as Medicare at a higher cost, and from slower growth in reimbursement rates to health care providers. But the response of President Obama's campaign also aimed to stoke voters' fears. It stressed -- rightly -- that the plan to curb Medicare costs proposed last year by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate, would add thousands of dollars to older Americans' out-of-pocket expenditures. Yet it ignored Mr. Ryan's recent efforts to soften the plan.

Both campaigns claim they are out to protect future health care. Yet the sniping hides the real issue. Protecting federal health programs over the long term, as the population ages and medical costs keep rising faster than economic growth, will require curbing the programs' spending. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that. The federal government's spending on health care consumes 4.8 percent of the nation's economic production and is expected to eat up 9.2 percent in 25 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. A vast majority of economists agree that restoring a sustainable budget will mean either cuts in Medicare and Medicaid or a tax increase on the middle class. Decisions will have to be made about what services are not worth the cost. Yet so far, our political leaders have failed to acknowledge this to voters, offering instead an illusion that we can resolve the matter without any pain. Recall the political firestorm in 2009 when the Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women start regular screening for breast cancer at age 50 rather than 40. ""This is how rationing begins,"" said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. ""This is when you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician."" The task force is an independent panel of experts financed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Doctors and private insurers usually follow its recommendations. Still, in 2010 -- after Mr. Obama's health reform legislation passed Congress -- the department said that insurers should ignore its latest findings and instead go back to its recommendation from 2002: that women start screening at 40.

Does it make sense that older adults in their last year of life consume more than a quarter of Medicare's expenditures, costing more than six times as much as other beneficiaries? Are there limits to what Medicare should spend on a therapy prolonging someone's life by a month or two? It's a tough political call. In light of the difficulties, our political leaders have preferred to punt on the issue, hoping it doesn't have to be decided on their watch. Instead, when they talk about health care, they call rationing by some other name. Rationing is inevitable in a world with finite resources. We do it in this country, too, and it is still one of the least fair and most inefficient rationing systems in the world. You get care if you have the money to pay for it; if not, you probably won't. The 30 percent of the population who are the heaviest users of health care account for nearly 89 percent of health care expenditures, according to a government study. But high-income Americans are more likely to see a doctor when they are sick, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the disparity between rich and poor is much higher than in other developed countries.

Meanwhile, tens of millions of Americans -- those whose employers don't provide health insurance, who are too poor to pay for it themselves and yet are too rich to use Medicaid -- get the least health care of all.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. A study of hospital emergency rooms in Wisconsin found that victims of severe traffic accidents without health insurance got 20 percent less care. Hospitals spent $3,300 more on average for each victim who was insured. They kept the insured 9.2 days, on average, and the uninsured just 6.4 days. Unsurprisingly, the uninsured were 40 percent more likely to die from their injuries.

Every health care proposal from the right and the left includes some form of implicit rationing device. Mr. Ryan's plan, on the Republican side, would keep spending on Medicare under 4.75 percent of the nation's output until 2050 by giving older adults born after 1958 a dollop of money to buy their own insurance, forcing many to choose cheaper plans or fewer procedures. The president's health care reform encourages rationing, too, by levying a tax on ""Cadillac"" insurance plans, and in turn pushing employers to seek cheaper options and lower costs. It creates an advisory board to cut costs from Medicare if spending rises above a set rate. And it finances an institute to evaluate which therapies are most clinically effective. Careful to avoid political blowback, the president's plan forbids Medicare to base its reimbursement decisions on the institute's findings. But neither initiative seems likely to solve our health care financing squeeze over the long term. The cuts proposed by Mr. Ryan -- shifting the risk of health care inflation onto the shoulders of older adults -- are certainly drastic. They also seem politically unfeasible. Under Mr. Ryan's most recent proposals, in 2030 Medicare would spend $2,200 less in today's money on each new enrollee than under the most likely outcome envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office based on current policies. By 2050, it would pay $8,000 less. Voters seem to think that might be too drastic a cut. The president's plan was more about offering health insurance to all, to end our Dickensian system of rationing by income, than long-term cost control. Savings mandated by the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years will be difficult to maintain beyond that. It puts a lot of faith on eliminating waste, with potentially large savings. David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard, argues that a third of our health care dollars go to therapies that do not improve our health. A lot of that waste could be slashed simply by no longer paying providers a fee for each service, whether we need it or not, and paying them instead to keep us healthy. Going after waste seems sensible in a health care system that costs more than almost any other in the developed world, yet delivers lower-quality care. But savings from waste tend to be hard to achieve. Even with the Affordable Care Act in place, federal health spending will eat up almost twice as much of this nation's economic product in 2037 as it does today, according to the budget office. While it is reasonable for politicians to shy away from rationing -- especially when voters believe no expense should be spared to save a human life -- if the experience of other countries serves as precedent, they will probably get there sooner or later. In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence determines what therapies will be covered by the National Health Service. It generally recommends against paying for a therapy that costs more than $31,000 to $47,000 for each year of life gained, adjusted for quality.","The United States already rations health care, mostly by income level.

At the wheel, Don McLellan, an owner and manager of the restoration arm of RM Auctions, is all smiles as he steers and shift gears, thoroughly enjoying the response of the light but powerful car. I'm trying to smile, too, as I hang on using the stirrup-style floor rail to catch my left foot and the handle of the gas cap behind Mr. McLellan's seat to maintain my grip on the passenger's perch. At speed, the wind whips over the hood and into our faces so forcefully that I'm not sure what I could do if asked to reach to my left and pump more air pressure into the gas tank. Fortunately, there's a duplicate pump on Mr. McLellan's side of the car -- the Mercer's steering wheel is on the right, typical of American cars of the era -- and he deftly uses it to demonstrate technology that's more than a century old. Later this summer, those challenges will be confronted by a new owner. This Mercer Type 35R Raceabout is scheduled to cross the block on Aug. 16 at the RM Auctions sale during the week of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance on the Monterey Peninsula of California. The presale estimate is $2.5 million to $3.5 million.

Mr. McLellan continues his lesson, showing me the foot pedal at the base of the dashboard that lets the exhaust run open and loud for racing or much more quietly for driving through town. Shouting over the wind, I ask about a porthole the size of a quarter in the center of the dashboard. Mr. McLellan points to the steady splash of liquid against the glass and explains that instead of a fussy gauge, this car lets you to see for yourself that oil is circulating and lubricating the engine. Ah, the engine. It's the small (301 cubic inches) but remarkably efficient and powerful T-head 4-cylinder engineered by Finley Robinson Porter for the Mercer Automobile Company, which was established in 1909 in Trenton by the Roebling family -- yes, the Roeblings of Brooklyn Bridge fame. With the engine's high compression ratio, at least for the era, and the car's frills-free design, Mercer Raceabouts regularly defeated the much larger and more powerful racing cars; this one still runs at speeds that approach in miles per hour the 103-year-old car's age in years. Mercer Raceabouts were driven by many auto racing pioneers, including Barney Oldfield and Ralph DePalma. Two Mercers started -- and both finished -- the inaugural Indianapolis 500. A Mercer was third in that race in 1912 and second in 1913. Phil Hill, who won the Formula One drivers championship in 1961, owned one; that car is part of the collection at the Petersen Automotive Museum in Los Angeles. But there's much more to this car -- chassis 35-R-354 and engine 35-4-137 -- than mechanical prowess. While it may not carry an oil pressure gauge, it does carry an impressive history, according to the auction house, including ownership by the family of Henry Austin Clark Jr. since 1949. Mr. Clark, whose family wealth came from interests in what was the world's largest sugar producer, was a friend of John F. Kennedy at Harvard and a force behind the Bridgehampton racetrack and road races on Long Island. He was also a collector -- actually, a savior of many rare vehicles from junkyards and scrap heaps.

Perhaps more important, he collected automotive literature, some two million books, papers and photographs that, upon his death in 1991, weighed 54,000 pounds and required three semitrailers to carry from Long Island to the Henry Ford museum in Dearborn, Mich. When Beverly Rae Kimes, an automotive historian who died in 2008, undertook the Standard Catalog of American Cars, she did much of her research at Mr. Clark's home, discovering documents verifying the production of perhaps a dozen brands of American automobiles that had been forgotten even by classic-car enthusiasts. When her work was published, it carried both her name and Mr. Clark's. And how does that book describe the Mercer Raceabout? ""For many people the Mercer was a hairy, thundering machine with monocle windshield in front, round gasoline tank in the rear and two bucket seats in between,"" Ms. Kimes and Mr. Clark wrote. ""Its coachwork consisted of a hood and fenders usually painted a yellow vivid enough to blind, and if that didn't, the abundance of brass would. This was the Raceabout, the most famous of Mercers."" After Mr. Clark's death, Ms. Kimes wrote an 18-page article about him for Automobile Quarterly. It started with the story about how, during one auto tour, Mr. Clark was sitting in his Pierce 66 enjoying a cocktail when a state trooper approached, ready to write a ticket: ""With the martini still in hand, Austie -- as he was known to his friends -- lifted the floorboards of the Pierce, reached down into its greasy innards and scooped up a handful of cotter pins, nuts and bolt and goop,"" which he dropped into the alcohol mixture. ""Officer,"" Mr. Clark said, ""I'm just cleaning these parts."" Ms. Kimes wrote that she liked that story ""because it says a lot about him: his presence of mind, resourcefulness, his sense of humor, that he liked to party."" Mr. Clark bought his Raceabout in 1949 from William C. Spear Jr. , a racecar driver and car collector. When Mr. Clark offered each of his children the opportunity to select one vehicle from a collection that once overflowed an entire museum -- his Long Island Automotive Museum -- Hal Clark said it took him fewer than 10 seconds to select the Mercer. ""Once you've had one ride in it, everything else you ride in, you compare to it,"" Hal Clark said, noting that the Mercer was one of the few cars ever produced that was ready to race right off the assembly line. ""You could buy the car, unbolt the fenders and take it onto the racetrack,"" he said. Mr. Clark said that the time had come for another family, or families, to enjoy the car, ""whether it ends up in a museum or a collection of someone who has other racecars or who just agrees with my father that it was the great car of its era.""",A 1911 Mercer Raceabout with an impressive history will be auctioned in August during the week of the Pebble Beach Concours d'Élégance in California,191d39c1-5dca-541c-8f98-ed6fef524083,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/07/13/automobiles/MERCER1/MERCER1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=247&w=600&s=bea0eebbaccf1ca4ee5a6383abfc401fc8e06bee0ba804e92180bc445b438a3f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Mercer Raceabouts were built for competition.

Art & Design,African Officials Respond to France's Restitution Report,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/design/africa-macron-report-restitution.html,"Initial responses from African officials to a report issued last week by France on the return of looted treasures from the continent reveal the path to restitution will be a thorny one. The report, commissioned by President Emmanuel Macron of France, recommended that all objects removed without consent from Africa and sent to France be permanently returned if the countries of origin ask for them. The first African official to react to the report, which has been met with trepidation by some museum directors in Europe, was Senegal's culture minister, Abdou Latif Coulibaly. Speaking at a news conference on Tuesday, Mr. Coulibaly called for the return of all Senegalese artwork held in French museums and institutions. ""We are ready to find solutions with France,"" Mr. Coulibaly said. ""But if 10,000 pieces are identified in the collections, we are asking for all 10,000.""

Senegal was one of the African countries highlighted in the report, which was written by two academics, Benedicte Savoy of France and Felwine Sarr of Senegal. In preparing the report, the two traveled to Senegal, as well as to Benin, Mali and Cameroon, to meet with government officials, museum directors and art specialists. Mr. Coulibaly's reaction, while not a formal claim, runs counter to the report's assurance that its recommendations would not see the widespread removal of all African objects from France's museums. ""There is no question, either for us or for our African counterparts, of emptying French or European museums to fill up African ones,"" Ms. Savoy, an art historian and professor at the Technical University of Berlin and a professor at the College de France, said in a previous interview with The Times. Rather, the aim of the recommendations is to achieve ""a rebalancing of the geography of African heritage in the world, which is currently extremely imbalanced, as European museums have almost everything, and African museums have almost nothing,"" Ms. Savoy said. Alexander Herman, assistant director of the Institute of Art and Law, an educational organization in Britain, said the practicalities of implementing the return of all Senegalese objects would be challenging.

""France and Senegal would have to enter into a bilateral agreement, out of which a commission would be established to determine, on a case-by-case basis, which Senegalese artifacts should be returned,"" he said in an interview on Friday. The report noted that artifacts acquired through documented transactions could be retained by French museums. ""Not everything would return to Senegal, even if the rather ambitious terms of the report are followed,"" Mr. Herman said. The response from the Ivory Coast was more in line with the report's position. On Wednesday, a government spokesman, Sidi Toure, said the country had identified a number of objects to be returned. ""Ivory Coast has drawn up a list of about a hundred masterpieces,"" Mr. Toure said in a statement. He added that specifics regarding the requested artifacts would be sent to French officials appointed to handle restitution requests. Mr. Toure said the returned objects would go to the national museum of Ivory Coast in Abidjan, which ""is able to recover and accommodate these different works when they are back."" The item at the top of Mr. Toure's list is a ceremonial drum from the people of the Abidjan region, which is currently housed in the Quai Branly Museum in Paris.",Government officials from Senegal and the Ivory Coast ask for African treasures to be returned.,d0d88b5a-3e32-5271-804f-325efcef1401,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/01/arts/01senegal-item-1/01senegal-item-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cd83b46d3e5a2e19dc3bfc51d8a72f1e1e3a21a08a0866d8d10c01285a8f5fe4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Senegal's culture minister, Abdou Latif Coulibaly, who on Tuesday called for the return of all Senegalese artwork held in French museums and institutions.",d0d88b5a-3e32-5271-804f-325efcef1401,N24News/imgs/d0d88b5a-3e32-5271-804f-325efcef1401.jpg,14
Global Business,Britain Offers Hand to Smaller Businesses,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/25/business/global/britain-offers-hand-to-smaller-businesses.html,"LONDON -- With Britain's moribund economy struggling to avert a return to recession, a government-backed lending program was extended and reworked Wednesday in the hope of freeing up borrowing to credit-starved small and medium-size companies. The initiative, announced a day before official figures will show whether Britain has avoided a third extended contraction in five years, underlines concerns about the difficulty British companies still face in raising cash after the financial crisis. Introduced last year, the program, the Funding for Lending Scheme, allows British banks that extend credit to borrow from the Bank of England, against a wide range of collateral, at an annual interest rate as low as one-quarter of a percent. Under the plans announced Wednesday, the program will be extended for a year until January 2015. It will focus more on smaller businesses, and participating banks will be able to lend to alternative providers of credit like financial leasing and factoring corporations, which help small companies raise money, and to mortgage and housing credit corporations.

Since its inception last August, the program has had mixed results, and the Bank of England says that an improvement in credit conditions has been less marked for smaller businesses than for larger businesses and households. The central bank said last month that in the fourth quarter of last year, 11 financial institutions made total drawdowns of PS9.5 billion, or $14.5 billion, under the program, taking the total amount drawn to PS13.8 billion. But it said that overall net lending by participating banks was down over the quarter by PS2.4 billion, or $3.7 billion. The changes mean that for every PS1 of additional lending by banks to small and medium-size businesses in the rest of 2013, the amount of funding that banks will be able to draw upon increases by PS10. ""The Bank of England and Treasury are throwing the kitchen sink at the problem,"" Robert Wood, chief economist for Britain at Berenberg Bank in London, said. He added that as well as helping small businesses, the move may lift the British housing market.

Mr. Wood added, however, that the move was not a silver bullet, both because of the broader economic situation and because of pressure on banks to build up their capital reserves to reduce risks in future financial crises.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. ""Firms are not borrowing and investing because the outlook for the economy is weak as strong headwinds, from Euro-worries to weak household income, are keeping confidence under wraps,"" he wrote. ""The scheme also requires banks to want to lend more. Banks are under heavy pressure from the other arm of the B.O.E. to raise more capital."" Mervyn A. King, governor of the Bank of England, said in a statement that an extension of the program was ""valuable, as it gives banks continued assurance against the risk that market funding rates increase."" George Osborne, the chancellor of the Exchequer, described the move as a big lift for small and medium-size businesses. ""The Funding for Lending Scheme has already reduced the costs of household mortgages and loans for businesses,"" he said in a statement. ""This innovative extension will now do even more for small and medium-sized businesses so that they can play their full part in creating new jobs."" Mr. Osborne has faced increased criticism since the International Monetary Fund raised doubts last week about the pace of his deficit reduction strategy, and Fitch became the second credit ratings agency to strip Britain of its prized triple-A credit rating.

On Thursday, first-quarter economic output data will be released, showing whether Britain's economy has slipped into a triple-dip recession, as some analysts have predicted. Chris Leslie, Treasury spokesman for the opposition Labour Party, welcomed the move announced Wednesday but said it fell short. ""Despite scheme after scheme -- from the failed Project Merlin deal with the banks to credit easing and now Funding for Lending -- net lending to businesses has fallen month by month under this government,"" he said. ""Labour called for reforms to this scheme last year, so these belated changes are welcome. But with net lending to businesses down by PS4.8 billion in the last three months alone, they do not go far enough.""","A lending program was extended and reworked to free up borrowing to small and medium-size companies, as the nation struggles to avert another recession.",19866559-5eec-50bb-885b-838faf0af893,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/25/business/Pound/Pound-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=640&w=600&s=db9794abb73099357dca3d29668d8781ce875d7cd5ca5492e6906ee6997f739f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mervyn A.

Art & Design,Shape-Shifting Art Tower Completes Prada's City Within a City,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/arts/design/prada-foundation-rem-koolhaas-oma-miuccia.html,"View from the northeast of the new ""Torre,"" a luminous tower of galleries designed for the Prada Foundation by Rem Koolhaas and OMA.Credit...Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times



View from the northeast of the new ""Torre,"" a luminous tower of galleries designed for the Prada Foundation by Rem Koolhaas and OMA.

MILAN -- The lambent new tower of art galleries Rem Koolhaas and his Rotterdam-based firm, OMA, have designed for the Prada Foundation is a chameleon. From the east, the elevation presents a slim, unadorned, milk-white concrete block, nine stories high, punctured by loggias -- a signpost, like the traditional village bell tower, rising above a low, scruffy neighborhood. To the north, where the facade meets Milan's skyline and becomes mostly glass, cantilevering over the street, the block breaks into a zigzag of shifting floor plates, rectangles and trapezoids, the whole building wedged onto a triangular plot.

In the Arthurian legend, the wizard Merlin put the sword in the stone. Mr. Koolhaas must be Merlin, I suppose. That makes Miuccia Prada, the Lady of the Lake. The tower completes the arts campus OMA has spent the past decade conceiving for the Prada Foundation. An offshoot of the global fashion conglomerate, dedicated to contemporary art and culture, the foundation commissions new art, presents exhibitions and organizes film festivals and other events. It also oversees the vast art collection Ms. Prada and her husband, Patrizio Bertelli, have put together. For years, it operated in far-flung locales. In 2008, Mr. Koolhaas and a partner, Christopher van Duijn, were enlisted to reimagine a former, turn-of-the-century distillery Prada owned as the foundation's permanent home. Walled-in, abutting a weedy stretch of railroad tracks, the distillery was a picturesque assortment of dilapidated stables, a bottling facility, a carriage house, some offices and warehouses.

Without it, the site first opened to the public in 2015. It featured about 120,000 square feet of new or reconfigured exhibition space; a new cinema; a new two-story Miesian pavilion of wide open gallery spaces, called the Podium, the whole building clad in light, shimmery panels of foamed aluminum, an automotive and medical industry material also used for bomb blast absorption that looks a little like rough stone. There was even a 1950s-style Italian cafe straight out of a Wes Anderson movie. That was because Wes Anderson designed it. Chameleons themselves, Mr. Koolhaas and Ms. Prada made natural confederates. She was the famous communist turned high-fashion mogul whose empire evolved from bags and backpacks constructed out of an industrial nylon lining material. He was a prophet of global cities who declared the countryside his real passion after everyone else jumped on the urbanist bandwagon. Her clothes always seemed less about what men desired than what whet her creative appetite. He was once invited to propose an expansion for the Museum of Modern Art and thumbed his nose at the selection committee by suggesting a billboard that said ""MoMA Inc."" They were both contrarians and closet optimists. And they shared a sense of humor. At one time it was rumored that Prada might back the Dutch architect for a seat in the Italian Parliament.

This has been Mr. Koolhaas's mantra. It is reflected in a foundation that's neither a preservation project nor a tear-down-and-build-new venture. Its mode is bricolage. More is more. Both is better. Cities are theaters and shape-shifters, too. I'm vaguely reminded of the old Cinecitta studios outside Rome, where Fellini worked and Mr. Anderson has made films. A stable house in the former distillery now resembles the cabinet rooms in old master museums. A tiny, Alice in Wonderland door opens onto an immense warehouse, 60 feet high and 200 feet long. And a building nicknamed the Haunted House is slathered in gold leaf, like an early Renaissance panel painting. (""A very cheap cladding material,"" Mr. Koolhaas has insisted, ""compared to marble or even paint."")

""There is no difference between gold and rags,"" Michelangelo Pistoletto, the veteran artist, once said. Mr. Pistoletto made his bones in the 1960s as a founder of Arte Povera, the Italian twist on post-Minimalism. Writing in 2001, after Mr. Koolhaas's Prada shop opened in downtown Manhattan, the critic Herbert Muschamp noted Prada's philosophical roots in Arte Povera. Mr. Muschamp recalled how Art Povera consisted of ""old bedding and tar-stained rope"" displayed ""in barren, out-of-the-way locations."" Somehow, he added, ""you always needed a private jet to get there."" Up to a point, that describes the foundation, with its fetishized lowdown materials like chipboard and orange construction fencing and slightly out-of-the-way location, south of the city's center. Arte Povera isn't the only ghost of midcentury modernism inhabiting the project -- there's the twee cafe, with its Formica furniture and veneered wood paneling; the new tower restaurant, with its furniture bought at auction from New York's Four Seasons; the cinema, with chairs imported from '70s-era Milanese movie houses; and the sun-baked, deeply shadowed squares, conjuring up de Chirico.

At the same time, there are the custom sheets of very modern translucent polycarbonate and aluminum handrails milled like Ferraris. There are the oak wood box-on-end pavers and the repurposed metal prison grates painted lime green, which serve as screens in the coat checks and bathroom stalls. Some visitors have complained the layout doesn't tell you where to go. You find your way around it. Like in a city. I think that is a virtue. But until now the project was missing its cornerstone where the 200-foot-high, 22,000-square-foot tower, or Torre, was meant to rise. Delays in construction stretched three years. They ended up allowing time to refine the design. The tower's six, stacked gallery floors were created as full-time showcases for Prada's private art collection. They're reached through a small, open-air lobby like a disco ball, with flashing screens and a dizzying cutout in the ceiling to reveal the building core's scissored stairs. One flight up, mirrored bathrooms, industrial sinks and a patterned floor summon to mind Pierre Chareau and Superstudio.

The middle-floor galleries end up feeling the nicest, proportion-wise. But the whole building is one narrative. As Federico Pompignoli, OMA's project manager, has said, the tower is ""an attempt at the white cube defying its own boringness."" Much credit here goes to him. He oversaw every inch of construction and it shows. Elevator cabs clad in backlit slabs of rose and green onyx suggest medieval reliquaries. I am told blacksmiths from a tiny shop outside Milan hand-tooled the restaurant's exquisite bar, sliding doors and custom-embossed the anodized aluminum panels on the terraces that look like expensive Lego pieces. I kept running my hands over the tower's concrete walls. Infused with Carrara marble and poured by construction workers who wore white gloves, they feel smooth as silk. The big rectangular and wedge-shaped galleries, windows alternating between panoramas of the city and narrow views over the campus, accommodate best the large-scale works in the inaugural show, ""Atlas."" It features Jeff Koons, Mona Hatoum, Michael Heizer and others. Check out the restaurant if you go. Works by Carsten Holler and Lucio Fontana are on permanent display.

From ""Atlas,"" I made my way through the loan exhibition about Fascist art that has taken over the pavilion and stables, watching a few of the old news clips of cheering mobs and Benito Mussolini in the cinema. Then I wandered into Mr. Anderson's cafe and ordered what may be the most delicious sandwich I have eaten in my entire life. Private museums are mostly vanity projects. Few invent social spaces. It may be the ultimate tribute to Mr. Koolhaas and OMA to say that the Prada campus works. The plazas are poetic. The galleries are practical and varied. Ms. Prada should be pleased and maybe a little worried. It's up to the foundation to program these spaces for generations to come. Architecturally speaking, there's a lot to live up to.","For Rem Koolhaas and Miuccia Prada, more is more.

Television,Stephen King Has Thoughts About Stephen King TV Shows,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/arts/television/stephen-king-adaptations-the-stand.html,"Stephen King has written some of the most beloved horror novels in the history of popular fiction, and many have been turned into equally acclaimed and successful films. Movies like ""Carrie,"" ""Stand by Me"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption"" have more than earned esteemed spots within the cinematic canon. Others -- ""Maximum Overdrive,"" ""Thinner,"" ""The Dark Tower"" -- have not. But what about the small screen? As with the film adaptations, attempts to bring King's books to life on TV have had mixed results, and few have reached the heights of ""The Green Mile"" or ""Misery."" But thanks to the longer running time afforded by a series, several of King's more unwieldy novels have proved better suited to television than to the multiplex. ""That is the great thing about TV,"" King said, calling from his home in Bangor, Maine. ""You can take these things as they are and expand more."" With a new adaptation of one of the author's longest, most complex novels, ""The Stand,"" arriving Thursday on CBS All Access, King looked back at the best and worst adaptations of his stories for television.

This two-part ABC mini-series, an adaptation of King's sprawling 1986 novel about a child-murdering monster in small-town Maine, is perhaps best remembered for Tim Curry's frightening performance as Pennywise the Clown. ""I liked that series a lot, and I thought Tim Curry made a great Pennywise,"" King said. ""It scared the [expletive] out of a lot of kids at that time."" In fact, King credits the impact of the series on children with the later success of the film version, which starred Bill Skarsgard as the diabolical clown and was a box-office sensation in 2017. (A 2019 sequel, based on the second half of the novel, was similarly successful.) ""One of the reasons the movie was a big hit was because kids remembered seeing it on TV,"" King said. ""So they went to see it."" ""I didn't like it; I didn't care for it at all,"" King said of ""The Tommyknockers,"" a TV adaptation of his 1987 science-fiction novel about the paranormal effects of a buried U.F.O. on the residents of a small town. (He has described the novel as ""an awful book."")

After both ""It"" and ""The Tommyknockers"" scored high ratings for ABC, the network agreed to green-light an ambitious adaptation of ""The Stand,"" King's 1978 epic about the survivors of an infectious disease that has killed more than 99 percent of the human race. Adapted by King himself and directed by his friend and frequent collaborator Mick Garris, the result is faithful and cohesive; the author likened it to other shows born of singular creative visions, like ""Godless"" and ""The Queen's Gambit."" ""Mick directed everything, and I wrote everything, so there was never any sense of unevenness in the way they worked -- it had one single style all the way through it,"" King said. ""Mick loved the book and was dedicated to the idea that we would just do the book, which is what we did. ABC spent a lot of money on it.""

A lesser-known King adaptation, ""The Langoliers"" is another two-part ABC mini-series based on a novella in the anthology book ""Four Past Midnight,"" from 1990. David Morse, Dean Stockwell, and Bronson Pinchot star as passengers on a commercial flight that slips backward through time and winds up stranded at an airport in Bangor. ""They came up to Bangor to actually film that,"" King recalled. ""I liked it because it brought money into the town, and I liked the screenplay. I can't remember if I wrote that or not. Did I?"" It was in fact written by Tom Holland, who also directed. ""Well, I did act in it,"" King said. He appears, briefly, as a sneering business executive in a dream sequence on an airport tarmac. King has never been shy about his preference for the TV version of ""The Shining"" over Stanley Kubrick's acclaimed 1980 movie adaptation of the 1977 novel, which follows an alcoholic teacher and playwright as he's driven to madness and violence by a remote haunted hotel in the Colorado Rockies. ""Let's put it this way,"" King said. ""I dislike the film. I always have. I admire the film, and I admire Kubrick as a director, which sometimes gets lost in the mix when people who absolutely love that film take me to task. I love Kubrick as a filmmaker, but I just felt that he didn't have the chops for this particular thing."" ""I don't like the arc that Jack Nicholson runs as Jack Torrance,"" he continued. ""Because it isn't really an arc -- it's a flat line. He's crazy from the jump.""

""Storm of the Century"" is not an adaptation, but an original mini-series King wrote for NBC. It's also, he said, his crowning television achievement. ""That is my absolute favorite of all of them,"" he said. Colm Feore stars as Andre Linoge, a nefarious demon who terrorizes a small Maine island town in the throes of a brutal blizzard. ""I loved Colm Feore as Linoge, and I loved the story,"" King said. ""They filmed it in Southwest Harbor in Maine in the wintertime and they got the snow, so you get the sense of this awesome blizzard and the people trapped in it. They did a terrific job."" King wrote ""Rose Red,"" another direct-for-TV project, while recovering from his near-fatal road accident at the turn of the millennium. ""I was in a lot of pain, but I thought I'd love to do an homage to Shirley Jackson,"" he remembers. The result was a special effects-heavy ghost story mini-series on ABC in the spirit of Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House."" The production encountered problems, including the death of the actor David Dukes, and in the end, ""I wasn't delighted with the way it turned out,"" King says.

""Under the Dome,"" King's novel from 2009, has an irresistible premise: A small town is inexplicably trapped inside a giant impenetrable dome. The CBS series adaptation, which starred Dean Norris of ""Breaking Bad"" as the town councilman James (Big Jim) Rennie, had a promising start. ""The first few episodes were great,"" King said. ""But the thing was, what CBS wanted was basically meatloaf -- nothing too challenging, something to just fill some hours."" As the series progressed, ""it went off the rails,"" he said, and ultimately ""descended into complete mediocrity."" Not that he was particularly troubled by it. ""It was a sad thing, but it didn't bother me,"" King said. ""I stopped watching after a while because I just didn't give a [expletive].""

""Mr. Mercedes"" is a thrilling, genuinely scary adaptation of King's series of recent crime novels about a retired Midwest detective taunted by a serial killer he was unable to catch during his career. Developed by AT&T's somewhat obscure Audience Network, the series is not as widely known as some of the author's other TV adaptations. King thinks that's too bad. ""It was like we brought a stadium show to a coffee shop,"" he said. ""I liked it a lot, but nobody saw it."" The show's three seasons have recently been picked up by NBC (it has not yet been renewed for a fourth) and are streaming on its Peacock platform. ""And thank God for that,"" King said. ""People are actually seeing it now.""

The new adaptation of ""The Stand"" on CBS All Access is much anticipated, and even King hasn't seen the finished product. ""I've seen some rough cuts, and I can't really give you an opinion yet except to say that it was interesting to see it brought to the 21st century and to see some of the changes that were made,"" he said. One clear improvement so far has to do with casting and diversity. ""The novel was very white; the mini-series was very white,"" he said.

Dance,'Maze' Review: Virtuoso Street Dance Sends Blurry Message,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/arts/dance/maze-review-street-dance-the-shed.html,"We hear the voice near the start of ""Maze,"" a frustrating dance-theater work debuting at the Shed this week. The message is true in several senses.

The intended one is thematic. As the program note indicates, ""Maze"" takes on social issues like ""the school-to-prison pipeline"" and ""systemic racism in the justice system."" Viewed historically, such topics can induce a bitter sense of deja vu.

The familiar smell also arises, though, from the many similarities between this production and ""Flexn,"" a show that originated at the Park Avenue Armory in 2015. Much of the talented cast and creative team are the same, as are many of the powerful themes, but so is the central problem: all that talent floundering for want of direction.

As in ""Flexn,"" one of the directors here is Reggie Gray, also known as Regg Roc, a pioneer in the Brooklyn-born street-dance style called flexn and the founder of the D.R.E.A.M. Ring, a crew that serves as cast for both shows. Mr. Gray was one of the first to develop the form's narrative potential -- to show how its joint-testing contortions, otherworldly gliding in sneakers and stop-motion pantomime could express the extreme emotional pressures experienced by its dancers.","This dance-theater work at the Shed shows off the brilliance of its dancers, but they founder for lack of direction.",c0076f7e-d9c4-588b-974a-a1cfedf9a4e9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/27/arts/26maze-3/26maze-3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=103f170fc4edbca673575a0f04327146499c653e9532d8f910a057660f0dee60&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Joshua &ldquo;Sage&rdquo; Morales, Derick &ldquo;Slicc&rdquo; Murreld, Quamaine &ldquo;Virtuoso&rdquo; Daniels, Glendon &ldquo;Tyme&rdquo; Charles (partially hidden) and Sean &ldquo;Brixx&rdquo; Douglas in &ldquo;Maze.&rdquo;",c0076f7e-d9c4-588b-974a-a1cfedf9a4e9,N24News/imgs/c0076f7e-d9c4-588b-974a-a1cfedf9a4e9.jpg,6
Food,What to Cook Right Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/dining/what-to-cook-right-now.html,"Good morning. Tuesday is the autumnal equinox, the sun right above the Equator, the length of day and night the same, a marker of harvest season, the first day of fall. (Confidential to those in Australia and New Zealand: Happy vernal equinox!) I'll mourn our lost summer with its mask-fogged sunglasses, its distanced yard hangs and awkward picnics, but revel in the cool nights and the promise of dinners rich with gravy.

It's smothered chicken time, the start of the season for pork chops in lemon-caper sauce (above), for smothered shrimp in crab meat gravy, for chicken-fried steak with queso, for meals you can accompany with dinner rolls for swiping, for apple pie and apple cake alike.

But maybe that's just me? Maybe you'd prefer a sweet potato bebinca, or chicken ragu with fennel. Egg curry? Mushroom soup gratinee? Here's what's on the NYT Cooking fall cooking bucket list.

It'd be nice to make a lasagna this week. Not to mention oven-fried patatas bravas, with two sauces!

The idea's just to cook against the loss of summer, loss of daylight, loss of outdoor freedoms, and replace it all with deliciousness and joy, with protein to nourish us as the mercury drops and winter stalks closer. So: Make delicious food this week; light where you eat with candles or hurricane lanterns; set the table with care. The idea is just to embrace the cozy, as the writer Isabel Gillies would say, to use cozy as a baseline that helps support your life and the lives of those with whom you live.","It's fall, and that means smothered chicken, pork chops and all the apple desserts.",e60e7de6-d209-5d8a-9504-114dcf77b768,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/10/magazine/10mag-eat/10mag-eat-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a3c13029ee714edca90702ff2f338549a06b00ff36f08ce96807e610e22af169&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Pork chops in lemon-caper sauce.,e60e7de6-d209-5d8a-9504-114dcf77b768,N24News/imgs/e60e7de6-d209-5d8a-9504-114dcf77b768.jpg,17
Real Estate,A Decision Clinched by a Yard,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/21/realestate/a-decision-clinched-by-a-yard.html,"Eight years ago, when Dr. Anthony C. Watkins and Dr. Khadijah Booth Watkins moved into hospital staff housing, a two-bedroom rental was fine for them and their young son. A few years after their second son arrived, the family moved within the building to a three-bedroom. For the last year or so, the Watkinses hunted casually for a place to buy, checking online listings and attending open houses. Hospital housing was convenient, but ""we knew it wasn't a long-term solution,"" said Dr. Watkins, a transplant surgeon. ""My wife was really stuck on a brownstone-type situation. Me, I'm from Tennessee. I was looking for something like a 40th-floor looking-at-the-city type of situation.""

""It no longer felt like this was a perk to live there,"" said Dr. Booth Watkins, a child and adolescent psychiatrist. The notice ""gave us the fire we needed. It wasn't feasible to pay that kind of money for what we had."" Their employer, New York-Presbyterian Hospital, declined to comment on its housing policies. So, with no time to buy a place, the couple went on the hunt for a rental for their family, which includes their sons, Khalil, 12, and Ayden, 6; Dr. Booth Watkins's father, Garland Booth, who moved in with them last year from Virginia; and their dog, Blu.

The couple started in East Harlem at a sleek 2007 condominium building, Observatory Place, on 104th Street near First Avenue. A two-bedroom two-bathroom apartment was for rent for $3,200 a month. Some of the two-bedrooms they had seen when they were looking casually were large enough to be converted to a three-bedroom, but not this one. They walked away from a $3,000-a-month duplex in a four-unit brownstone on East 129th Street -- roomy but rundown and near the commotion of the Metro-North railroad tracks. They considered a three-bedroom for $3,800 a month at 107th Street near Central Park. ""One of my dreams was to be close to Central Park so I could have access to that to run,"" Dr. Watkins said. But the place wasn't big enough and ""didn't have that homey feel for us."" Many of the apartments they saw had tiny bedrooms. Though they looked elsewhere, the search always returned to Harlem. ""The farther up you go, the more space you get for less money,"" Mr. James said. ""That fact kept proving to be.""

The family loved a two-bedroom sublet at Strivers Lofts on West 135th Street. The monthly rent was $3,950, and a third bedroom could be carved from the generous L-shape living and dining area. With a police station across the street, the neighborhood seemed especially safe. The roof deck was enticing, too. But after some back and forth, the couple were disappointed to be told it had been rented to someone else. Finally, they came to a recently converted brownstone with two units in the West 130s. The upper duplex, $3,800 a month, had three bedrooms and three bathrooms. It was everything they wanted. They were about to take it.

But they made the mistake of visiting the lower unit: a three-bedroom triplex with four bathrooms, a finished basement and a backyard. At $4,700 a month, ""it was a little hefty on the price,"" Dr. Watkins said. But, upon reflection, it seemed a better choice, with fewer stairs to climb than the top unit, Dr. Booth Watkins said. ""And I really loved the idea of the yard."" So at the last minute, the Drs. Watkins changed their minds. They signed a two-year lease for the triplex, paid a broker fee of 15 percent of a year's rent, or $8,460, and arrived last spring. ""That was a pill to swallow -- and then we had to put down a dog deposit,"" Dr. Watkins said. ""So the initial move-in was a pretty penny."" More space, they found, made for more expenses -- a grill, outdoor furniture, higher utility costs, gardening supplies for Mr. Booth's vegetable garden. ""We used the move as an opportunity to upgrade some furniture,"" Dr. Watkins said, but disposing of the old stuff ""kind of backfired because we were in the living room with no sofa for a long time, and I bought a brand-new TV, so we had a nice TV in the living room but no furniture."" They hauled in some temporary chairs. One thing they lack is closet space. ""I guess we never realized we packed so much stuff in the old apartment,"" Dr. Booth Watkins said. In their new home, ""it felt like we had a lot of space, but no place to put things.""",Dr. Anthony Watkins and Dr. Khadijah Booth Watkins went looking for an apartment for their family.

Music,James Brown's Will: Is It Inching Toward Closure After 14 Years?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/arts/music/james-brown-will.html,"After more than a decade of litigation over James Brown's estate, which he, the Godfather of Soul, had largely bequeathed to underprivileged students in South Carolina and Georgia, the chief justice of South Carolina's Supreme Court seemed irritated. ""Has one scholarship been given, pursuant to Mr. Brown's will?"" the justice, Donald W. Beatty, pointedly asked at a hearing last October. ""So all the people who've gotten any money out of this are the lawyers, thus far?"" S. Alan Medlin, a University of South Carolina law professor who represents Mr. Brown's wife, Tommie Rae Hynie, responded, ""Maybe some, Your Honor."" The judge was not amused. ""It's quite bothersome,"" he said, ""considering the will was clear."" But now, the state's Supreme Court has taken a large step toward unraveling the tangle of litigation that has trailed the estate since Mr. Brown's death on Christmas Day in 2006. The five justices ruled unanimously last week that Ms. Hynie was not legally married to Mr. Brown because she had not annulled a previous marriage.

Legal experts say the decision weakens Ms. Hynie's claim to Mr. Brown's estate, which has been subject to a variety of opinions on its value, from $5 million to $100 million. In addition, there is the potential value of copyrights to classics such as ""I Feel Good"" and ""Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud,"" which are not part of the estate. While the decision is not the sort of magic wand that will make years of acrimony and potential further appeals disappear, experts said it was a clear step forward in resolving a dispute that has begotten case after case in the courts. In its ruling, the Supreme Court instructed the lower court to ""promptly proceed with the probate of Brown's estate in accordance with his estate plan,"" which called for the creation of a charitable trust to help educate poor children.

Ms. Hynie, a singer who met Mr. Brown in 1998 after she performed a show in Las Vegas, has been a key player in the legal battle over Mr. Brown's assets. Independent of what Mr. Brown had spelled out in his will regarding beneficiaries, as his widow, she would have had the right under state law to a third of his estate value, Professor Malagrino said. But when Mr. Brown and Ms. Hynie married in 2001, she was married to another man: Javed Ahmed. She said in court that she had later learned that he had three wives in his native Pakistan. (After Mr. Brown learned of Ms. Hynie's earlier marriage, he filed for an annulment in 2004.) Ms. Hynie's lawyers have argued that Mr. Ahmed was a bigamist and that, as a result, her earlier marriage was void. Lower courts had upheld that view and declared her marriage to Mr. Brown as valid. But, citing its 2008 ruling in another case, the state's highest court disagreed: ""All marriages contracted while a party has a living spouse are invalid unless the party's first marriage has been 'declared void' by an order of a competent court."" In the case of Ms. Hynie's marriage to Mr. Ahmed, no such declaration had occurred. Robert Rosen, one of Ms. Hynie's lawyers, said in a statement, ""We are naturally very disappointed in the ruling."" He said he planned to ""file a petition to reconsider and rehear the decision."" Ms. Hynie, who was entitled as spouse to a share of Mr. Brown's music copyrights under federal law, has already settled part of her dispute with the estate. Under that settlement, Ms. Hynie had agreed to give the charity 65 percent of any proceeds from her so-called termination rights -- copyrights that, though once sold, can return to the songwriter or his heirs after several decades, according to court papers. ""Mrs. Brown,"" said Mr. Rosen, ""had given up her contests to the estate and charitable trust and agreed to give substantial funds from her very valuable federal rights to the charitable trust for needy students, which otherwise would not go to the charity. In our opinion, under her plan, many more millions of dollars would have flowed from those federal rights to the charitable trust if she had been confirmed as the surviving spouse.""

Mr. Brown's will had set aside $2 million to underwrite scholarships for his grandchildren. It designated that his costumes and other household effects were to go to six of his children; the rest of the estate was to go to the charitable trust for the poor, called the ""I Feel Good Trust."" ""We won,"" Daryl Brown, one of Mr. Brown's children, said by phone last week. ""It's a beautiful thing."" Much of the value in Mr. Brown's legacy arises from the ""termination rights"" to Mr. Brown's song publishing, which are not part of the estate. The copyrights sold to a music publisher can be terminated after several decades and the rights revert to the songwriters or their heirs, who can strike deals to sell or license the songs.

Some of the 900 songs that Mr. Brown wrote have appeared in commercials by companies including Walmart and L.L. Bean; rappers like Jay-Z and Dr. Dre have sampled his music on lucrative hits; and his 1968 classic ""Say It Loud -- I'm Black and I'm Proud -- Part 1"" recently landed atop Spotify's popular Black Lives Matter playlist. ""'I Feel Good' alone pretty much could support you and me for the next 100 years,"" said Walt McLeod, a longtime Newberry, S.C., lawyer and former state representative who has followed the case. As Mr. Brown's spouse, Ms. Hynie sold her share of termination rights in five of the songwriter's works to the publisher Warner Chappell Music for nearly $1.9 million in 2015, according to a federal lawsuit by nine of Mr. Brown's children and grandchildren. The lawsuit accused Ms. Hynie and her son, James Brown II, of ""unlawfully"" making deals without informing the other children and grandchildren. Ms. Hynie and her son denied that, asserting that the heirs' lawsuit was filled with ""misrepresentations and material omissions."" Lawyers for the nine heirs negotiated a settlement with Warner Chappell where the heirs also transferred their shares and received half of that money, Mr. Toberoff said, but the federal lawsuit is still pending.

Though it is far from a capstone, the Supreme Court ruling is a significant decision in a case that has entangled multiple participants. Although Mr. Brown's 2000 will said that any heirs who challenged it would be disinherited, several of his children and grandchildren sued after his death. They asked to remove Mr. Brown's appointed executors, including the accountant David Cannon; the lawyer Albert H. Dallas (known as Buddy); and the former judge Alfred Bradley. One of the heirs' lawyers early on argued that Mr. Brown, who had drug problems, had diminished mental capacity and was unfairly influenced by these associates, who have since been dismissed from the case. In 2008, Henry McMaster, South Carolina's attorney general, brokered a compromise among the heirs, giving a quarter of the estate to Mr. Brown's children and grandchildren and a quarter to Ms. Hynie. A district court approved the settlement and appointed Russell Bauknight, a public accountant, to oversee the estate. Mr. McMaster, now the state's Republican governor, told The Times in 2014: ""We were very, very happy with that settlement. Of course, our preference would have been for the wills to have worked exactly as intended by Mr. Brown, but it was clear that was not going to happen due to the conflicting claims as well as the copyright laws."" But the Supreme Court had thrown out the settlement in 2013, saying it led to ""the total dismemberment of Brown's carefully crafted estate plan and its resurrection in a form that grossly distorts his intent.""",A decision by the Supreme Court of South Carolina has raised expectations that the many legal fights over the singer's estate may soon be drawing to a close.,ce846eab-4e1c-58b9-92f6-b4722f235cff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/27/arts/24brownwill1/24brownwill1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=64bbb1755f9710fd557c118ba2a57c08715b4ae871c578109697462de9d685bb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The will of James Brown, who died in 2006, has been the subject of court fights since he died almost 14 years ago.",ce846eab-4e1c-58b9-92f6-b4722f235cff,N24News/imgs/ce846eab-4e1c-58b9-92f6-b4722f235cff.jpg,12
Economy,Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/12/business/economy/long-slog-for-foreign-doctors-to-practice-in-us.html,"Sajith Abeyawickrama, who came in 2010 from Sri Lanka, teaches exam prep on genetics at Kaplan Medical in Newark, N.J.

Thousands of foreign-trained immigrant physicians are living in the United States with lifesaving skills that are going unused because they stumbled over one of the many hurdles in the path toward becoming a licensed doctor here. The involved testing process and often duplicative training these doctors must go through are intended to make sure they meet this country's high quality standards, which American medical industry groups say are unmatched elsewhere in the world. Some development experts are also loath to make it too easy for foreign doctors to practice here because of the risk of a ""brain drain"" abroad. But many foreign physicians and their advocates argue that the process is unnecessarily restrictive and time-consuming, particularly since America's need for doctors will expand sharply in a few short months under President Obama's health care law. They point out that medical services cost far more in the United States than elsewhere in the world, in part because of such restrictions. The United States already faces a shortage of physicians in many parts of the country, especially in specialties where foreign-trained physicians are most likely to practice, like primary care. And that shortage is going to get exponentially worse, studies predict, when the health care law insures millions more Americans starting in 2014.

The new health care law only modestly increases the supply of homegrown primary care doctors, not nearly enough to account for the shortfall, and even that tiny bump is still a few years away because it takes so long to train new doctors. Immigrant advocates and some economists point out that the medical labor force could grow much faster if the country tapped the underused skills of the foreign-trained physicians who are already here but are not allowed to practice. Canada, by contrast, has made efforts to recognize more high-quality training programs done abroad. ""It doesn't cost the taxpayers a penny because these doctors come fully trained,"" said Nyapati Raghu Rao, the Indian-born chairman of psychiatry at Nassau University Medical Center and a past chairman of the American Medical Association's international medical graduates governing council. ""It is doubtful that the U.S. can respond to the massive shortages without the participation of international medical graduates. But we're basically ignoring them in this discussion and I don't know why that is."" Consider Sajith Abeyawickrama, 37, who was a celebrated anesthesiologist in his native Sri Lanka. But here in the United States, where he came in 2010 to marry, he cannot practice medicine. Instead of working as a doctor himself, he has held a series of jobs in the medical industry, including an unpaid position where he entered patient data into a hospital's electronic medical records system, and, more recently, a paid position teaching a test prep course for students trying to become licensed doctors themselves. For years the United States has been training too few doctors to meet its own needs, in part because of industry-set limits on the number of medical school slots available. Today about one in four physicians practicing in the United States were trained abroad, a figure that includes a substantial number of American citizens who could not get into medical school at home and studied in places like the Caribbean.

But immigrant doctors, no matter how experienced and well trained, must run a long, costly and confusing gantlet before they can actually practice here. The process usually starts with an application to a private nonprofit organization that verifies medical school transcripts and diplomas. Among other requirements, foreign doctors must prove they speak English; pass three separate steps of the United States Medical Licensing Examination; get American recommendation letters, usually obtained after volunteering or working in a hospital, clinic or research organization; and be permanent residents or receive a work visa (which often requires them to return to their home country after their training). The biggest challenge is that an immigrant physician must win one of the coveted slots in America's medical residency system, the step that seems to be the tightest bottleneck. That residency, which typically involves grueling 80-hour workweeks, is required even if a doctor previously did a residency in a country with an advanced medical system, like Britain or Japan. The only exception is for doctors who did their residencies in Canada. The whole process can consume upward of a decade -- for those lucky few who make it through. ""It took me double the time I thought, since I was still having to work while I was studying to pay for the visa, which was very expensive,"" said Alisson Sombredero, 33, an H.I.V. specialist who came to the United States from Colombia in 2005. Dr. Sombredero spent three years studying for her American license exams, gathering recommendation letters and volunteering at a hospital in an unpaid position. She supported herself during that time by working as a nanny. That was followed by three years in a residency at Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., and one year in an H.I.V. fellowship at San Francisco General Hospital. She finally finished her training this summer, eight years after she arrived in the United States and 16 years after she first enrolled in medical school.

Only 118 of those doctors, he said, have successfully made it to residency. ""If I had to even think about going through residency now, I'd shoot myself,"" said Dr. Fernandez-Pena, who came to the United States from Mexico in 1985 and chose not even to try treating patients once he learned what the licensing process requires. Today, in addition to running the Welcome Back Initiative, he is an associate professor of health education at San Francisco State.

* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The counterargument for making it easier for foreign physicians to practice in the United States -- aside from concerns about quality controls -- is that doing so will draw more physicians from poor countries. These places often have paid for their doctors' medical training with public funds, on the assumption that those doctors will stay. ""We need to wean ourselves from our extraordinary dependence on importing doctors from the developing world,"" said Fitzhugh Mullan, a professor of medicine and health policy at George Washington University in Washington. ""We can't tell other countries to nail their doctors' feet to the ground at home. People will want to move and they should be able to. But we have created a huge, wide, open market by undertraining here, and the developing world responds."" About one in 10 doctors trained in India have left that country, he found in a 2005 study, and the figure is close to one in three for Ghana. (Many of those moved to Europe or other developed nations other than the United States.) No one knows exactly how many immigrant doctors are in the United States and not practicing, but some other data points provide a clue. Each year the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a private nonprofit, clears about 8,000 immigrant doctors (not including the American citizens who go to medical school abroad) to apply for the national residency match system. Normally about 3,000 of them successfully match to a residency slot, mostly filling less desired residencies in community hospitals, unpopular locations and in less lucrative specialties like primary care. Over the last five years, an average of 42.1 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the national match system succeeded. That compares with an average match rate of 93.9 percent for seniors at America's mainstream medical schools.

Mr. Abeyawickrama, the Sri Lankan anesthesiologist, has failed to match for three years in a row; he blames low test scores. Most foreign doctors spend several years studying and taking their licensing exams, which American-trained doctors also take. He said he didn't know this, and misguidedly thought it would be more expeditious to take all three within seven months of his arrival. ""That was the most foolish thing I ever did in my life,"" he says. ""I had the knowledge, but I did not know the art of the exams here."" Even with inadequate preparation, he passed, though earning scores too low to be considered by most residency programs. But as a testament to his talents, he was recently offered a two-year research fellowship at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, starting in the fall. He is hoping this job will give residency programs reason to overlook his test scores next time he applies. ""Once I finish my fellowship in Cleveland, at one of the best hospitals in America, I hope there will be some doors opening for me,"" he said. ""Maybe then they will look at my scores and realize they do not depict my true knowledge."" The residency match rate for immigrants is likely to fall even lower in coming years. That is because the number of accredited American medical schools, and therefore United States-trained medical students, has increased substantially in the last decade, while the number of residency slots (most of which are subsizided by Medicare) has barely budged since Congress effectively froze residency funding in 1997. Experts say several things could be done to make it easier for foreign-trained doctors to practice here, including reciprocal licensing arrangements, more and perhaps accelerated American residencies, or recognition of postgraduate training from other advanced countries. Canada provides the most telling comparison. Some Canadian provinces allow immigrant doctors to practice family medicine without doing a Canadian residency, typically if the doctor did similar postgraduate work in the United States, Australia, Britain or Ireland. There are also residency waivers for some specialists coming from select training programs abroad considered similar to Canadian ones.

As a result, many (some estimates suggest nearly half) foreign-trained physicians currently coming into Canada do not have to redo a residency, said Dr. Rocco Gerace, the president of the Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada. In the United States, some foreign doctors work as waiters or taxi drivers while they try to work through the licensing process. Others decide to apply their skills to becoming another kind of medical professional, like a nurse practitioner or physician assistant, adopting careers that require fewer years of training. But those paths present barriers as well. The same is true for other highly skilled medical professionals. Hemamani Karuppiaharjunan, 40, was a dentist in her native India, which she left in 2000 to join her husband in the United States. She decided that going back to dentistry school in the United States while having two young children would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Instead, she enrolled in a two-year dental hygiene program at Bergen Community College in Paramus, N.J., which cost her $30,000 instead of the $150,000 she would have needed to attend dental school.

Opinion,Who's the Best First Lady?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/opinion/first-ladies-2020-election.html,"Already sorta looking forward to the Republican convention next week. The White House says Melania Trump will be speaking to the American people from the Rose Garden on Tuesday. Chances are her speechwriters won't lift any lines from Michelle Obama like they did four years ago. Although if you hear Melania urging her audience to ""grab our comfortable shoes, put on our masks, pack a brown-bag dinner and maybe breakfast, too,"" when they go to the polls, you will know what happened. There's still some first lady fascination at the conventions. Michelle Obama's feisty first-night Democratic finale had people swooning. (""If we have any hope of ending this chaos, we have got to vote for Joe Biden like our lives depend on it."") Listening, I remembered the first time I ever saw her at a speaking engagement. It was very early in the 2008 campaign, and she appeared to be a nervous wreck. It wasn't really the public speaking that scared her -- it was the thought that she could say something as an aside, or by mistake, that would screw up everything and ruin her husband's chance of becoming president.

I dare say we can all agree she's gotten over that. Jill Biden introduced herself to the national audience from a classroom where she used to teach English. Dr. Biden talks a lot about education, which is great. And she can remind voters of her husband's extraordinary story of achievement combined with personal loss. And when things calm down she has some great sagas from the past, like the time she lobbied against the idea of a Biden presidential campaign in 2003 by walking past his advocates in a bikini with the word ""no"" written across her stomach. Besides Barack Obama, the Democrats' Day 3 was a woman's place, even if a virtual one. Starring Kamala Harris, of course, and Hillary Clinton, whose attempt to move from that president's-wife shelf into the top job pretty much defined early-21st-century American politics. Just for the heck of it, let's take a historical walk down First Lady Lane. Martha Washington tried, without much success, to get her husband to stop throwing extremely boring dinner parties. Dolley Madison opened up Washington to the kind of socializing nobody expected to find in a primitive capital in a swamp. Visiting diplomats must have thanked God for them at evening prayers. Sarah Polk's husband, James, was president just before the awful period leading up to the Civil War. She served him as everything from secretary to political strategist until he died right after ending his term. She was the only first lady who never had a child -- James was probably sterile or impotent. As a teenager, he suffered from urinary bladder stones that became so painful he was operated on even though he had to be strapped down for the surgeon who had no anesthetic and could offer him only brandy.

I always like to drop in that James Polk story because I want you to remember it the next time the current president seems to be feeling sorry for himself. After the Polk era presidential spouses retreated into the background. (Zachary Taylor's wife, Margaret, was so low profile that when Taylor died in office, an official deathbed portrait of the grieving survivors showed the first lady with her hands covering her face -- nobody was entirely sure what she looked like.) The modern first lady era began with Eleanor Roosevelt, who was really too extraordinary to compare to anyone else, and moved on to Mamie Eisenhower, who was heavily marketed as a presidential wife. (""Keep our first lady in the White House for four more years!"") Mamie made it very clear that she wasn't interested in mega-achievement. One of her favorite maxims was: ""Every woman over 50 should stay in bed until noon.""

Her favorite color, the nation knew, was pink, and we hit some new marker in 1955 when Ike suffered a heart attack and the public was informed that Mamie was staying in the hospital room next to his, requesting virtually no special treatment except a pink toilet seat. We marched on to the present, through Jacqueline Kennedy, who gave the job mega-glamour, and Lady Bird Johnson, who Americans came to realize was actually the family breadwinner, through the super-efficient Rosalynn Carter and Nancy Reagan, who the public was taught to think of as only a superficial snob until her husband got sick and everyone realized that, politics aside, this really was a love match. With Hillary, everything changed. She became as much a part of the public consciousness as the men in the White House. She reminded the country that it was time to think about women in a different presidential role. She also demonstrated what a very bad idea it was to try to use the first lady thing as a springboard for the top job.

Although it's not likely that many of the Democrats at the convention Wednesday were holding grudges. Clinton was one of the stars of the night. ""Remember back in 2016 when Trump asked, 'What do you have to lose?'"" she asked them. ""Well, now we know."" Marching through modern history with Hillary was at times traumatic, but it was never defeatist. Everybody moves on. It's not too tough to have a women-themed night at a political convention featuring a female speaker of the House, a female vice-presidential candidate and the former first lady who reminded the country it was time to think about women in a different White House job. This convention marks the point where everyone has agreed the debate about gender at the top is all over. The future looks pretty terrifying on occasion, but it's almost certainly going to be one full of expanding political opportunities for women. More once and future female governors and senators. The vice presidency will look like old hat. We'll refer to the chief justice of the Supreme Court as ""her"" and gossip about which guy might make the best first gentleman.

Sports,Le'Veon Bell Joins Jets After Sitting Out 2018 Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/sports/football/leveon-bell-jets.html,"Le'Veon Bell, the superstar running back who sat out last season in a salary dispute with the Pittsburgh Steelers, has agreed to a free-agent deal with the Jets. Bell, 27, is considered one of the most versatile offensive players in the N.F.L. After ESPN broke the news early Wednesday that he had come to terms with the Jets, Bell confirmed it on Twitter and Instagram.

Bell's anticipated average salary of $13.25 million would make him the league's second-highest-paid running back, behind Todd Gurley of the Los Angeles Rams. But that could be a bargain with Bell, as other than the question marks created by a year away from the game he represents a dramatic upgrade for the Jets, a team that ranked 26th in the N.F.L. in rushing last year.
* None
* Week 11 Takeaways: Here is what we learned this week.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Jets Lose Again: Falling to the Miami Dolphins, the Jets' receiver Elijah Moore offered consolation.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. Selected by Pittsburgh with the 48th pick of the 2013 draft, Bell had a solid rookie campaign before exploding in 2014 with 2,215 yards from scrimmage and 11 touchdowns. While his time on the field has been limited somewhat by drug and substance abuse suspensions -- along with his full-season holdout -- he has 7,996 yards from scrimmage in 62 career games.

With the Jets he will be the centerpiece of an offense designed by the team's new coach, Adam Gase, the mastermind of a Denver Broncos offense that averaged 37.9 points a game with Peyton Manning in 2013. (Under Gase, the Miami Dolphins finished in the bottom half of the league in scoring the past three seasons.) Bell will serve as the Jets' top running back, but he will also be one of their most talented receivers. That will help take some of the burden off quarterback Sam Darnold, who is still developing after being selected with the No. 3 overall pick last year. In Darnold's uneven rookie season, the Jets had a running back surpass 100 rushing yards in a game only two times.

In Bell, the Jets are anticipating production out of the backfield unlike anything the team has seen since Curtis Martin retired. Martin, a Hall of Fame running back, twice surpassed 1,800 yards from scrimmage in a season for the Jets -- the only two times in franchise history that a player has done so. Bell easily topped that figure in three of his last four seasons. Bell's decision, which had been eagerly anticipated since the league's so-called legal tampering period opened on Monday, officially ends a stalemate that resulted in the unusual choice by a player to give up an entire season of his prime. While Bell had consistently thrived on the field in Pittsburgh, he regularly clashed with the front office off it, believing he was being dramatically underpaid once his versatility was considered. After a strong 2017 season, in which he rushed for 1,291 yards and led the N.F.L. with 406 touches, Bell turned down a contract offer that was reported at five years and $70 million, citing the small amount of guaranteed money in the deal. He then refused to play on a franchise tag that would have paid him $14.5 million in 2018, hoping that his conviction could earn a shot at unrestricted free agency.

The gambit paid off, at least in terms of freeing him from Pittsburgh's control, as the Steelers decided they would not use the franchise tag on him again, making him a free agent. In exchange for his signing with the Jets, Pittsburgh will receive a compensatory pick in this year's draft. The Steelers, who adequately replaced Bell with James Conner and then barely missed the playoffs, have now lost two All-Pro offensive players this off-season. On Saturday the team agreed to trade Antonio Brown, its top wide receiver, to the Oakland Raiders for two midround draft picks. Bell, who grew up in Ohio and starred in college at Michigan State, will not have to wait long to get a chance to prove himself against his former team. The Jets are scheduled to host the Steelers at some point during the season, though an exact date for the game has yet to be announced.",The superstar running back missed the entire 2018 season because of a salary dispute with Pittsburgh.

Television,"'The Americans' Season 6, Episode 3 Recap: Moscow Believes in Beef Stew",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/arts/television/the-americans-season-6-episode-3-recap-urban-transport-planning.html,"""Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears,"" Tchaikovsky, zharkoye. Movie, music, meat stew. For the third week in a row on ""The Americans,"" Claudia hosted a meeting of her informal Soviet culture appreciation society -- other members: Paige and Elizabeth -- and this time they cooked, assembling a traditional Russian recipe. Back in Moscow rival factions may be battling over the Soviet Union's future but in Washington these three are rediscovering its heart, even if Paige doesn't know how to slice a carrot. Elsewhere in the episode, the dangers and deceptions of the show's end game continued to mount. Philip lied to and spied on Elizabeth, and Oleg lied to Stan while risking everything by meeting with Philip. Elizabeth, meanwhile, just kept doing what she does: exercising extremely tough love with Paige, surveilling the arms negotiators and killing another American, an innocent one this time. The action picked up straight from last week, with Elizabeth in the Jenningses' garage scrubbing off General Rennhull's blood. Inside Philip tried to use some of his EST training to comfort Paige, while they both glanced nervously toward the door.

They were right to be wary: Elizabeth immediately began dressing down Paige for leaving her post and possibly endangering the mission. Paige was worried about her mother, of course, but Elizabeth was hearing no excuses and brooking no Philip-like softness: ""You don't get to talk about what you thought or how you felt or anything else, not now."" When Paige asked if she could spend the night at her parents' house, Philip said ""Of course"" but Elizabeth said no to the change in routine, and Paige, the good soldier, got up without protest and went home alone. It was more fuel for the Elizabeth haters out there -- a group of which I am emphatically not part -- but we all realize that her love of, and fear for, Paige are at the heart of her reactions, right? Later, without telling Paige the whole story, Elizabeth told her that Rennhull ""was caught up in something and didn't see a way out,"" which of course was a pretty good description of Elizabeth's current situation. Elizabeth acknowledged that she mishandled the whole Rennhull situation, telling Philip that she moved too fast because of the pressure she's under from the ""trouble back home."" In a quiet, sad moment in the kitchen, they both kept secrets, though Elizabeth admitted that she was withholding her mission from Philip. Philip, guilty and grim, was just plain working her. The mission took Elizabeth and the chastened (but increasingly self-assured) Paige to a stakeout of Haskard's team of American and Soviet arms negotiators. After some more baseball talk -- Haskard is a fan of the Minnesota Twins, formerly the Washington Senators -- there was finally some action involving the Soviet expert Elizabeth is staking out. When an American suggested a get-together at his house to watch a World Series game, two Soviets immediately begged off, but Elizabeth's target was suspiciously enthusiastic. There was also the matter of the radiation sensor Rennhull was supposed to have obtained. (As Philip somewhat snippily pointed out, Rennhull no longer has access.) Shifting focus to a worker at a warehouse where the sensors are stored, she posed as an auditor to quiz him about security procedures. It looked like a benign operation until he mentioned that his girlfriend worked there, too -- in security. Cue the chokehold strangulation, with Elizabeth subduing a considerably larger man for the second week in a row. (She killed the civilian to the melancholy strains of Leonard Cohen's ""Dance Me to the End of Love"" on the soundtrack.) Elsewhere, it was a good episode for Stan Beeman fans. We got to see him in the kitchen with Renee, who appeared to upend a lot of fan speculation by announcing that she wanted to serve her country and join the F.B.I. Stan gently pointed out that she was over the cut-off age for new agents, 37. (Presumably the KGB would know that.)

We also got to see Stan and Dennis in a rare moment of triumph, snatching Gennadi and Sofia and her son, Ilya, out of danger in a risky, split-second bit of spy theater. (I mistakenly included a description of this scene in an early version of last week's recap.) Of course it ended in embarrassment and pain, as so many scenes involving Stan do -- he had to tell a distraught Gennadi that Sofia wanted a divorce and that Gennadi probably wouldn't see her or Ilya again. Awkwardness, thy name is Beeman. And then Stan was involved in the best moment of the episode, his long-awaited reunion with Oleg at the Potomac Inn, a delicate scene finely played by Noah Emmerich and Costa Ronin. Stan's emotions and motivations were manifold. He wanted to apologize for having put Oleg in danger but also take credit for having intervened to save him. He needed to do his job, questioning Oleg's presence in Washington, and be a friend, warning him, ""Whatever you're doing here, don't."" (Oleg's cover story provided the episode's title, with Stan asking: ""Urban transport planning. What's that?"") They bonded over their shared love for Nina, but otherwise Oleg stonewalled Stan, showing him the door. And in the episode's dour, ominous ending, he met Philip, who had donned a disguise to report on his own wife. Though what he reported, we didn't see.
* Philip continued to fret over business -- we saw him poring over a pile of bills -- and in a painful scene he carried out a positive-thinking exercise at the travel agency, forcing his employees to gather and discuss sales strategies. He exhorted them like a cheerleader or an encounter-group huckster before escaping into his office. He may be a master of duplicity and deception, but his management skills need work.
* In a potentially series-defining development, Dennis mentioned Rennhull's death to Stan, and Stan noted the odd coincidence of a man with no history of depression, who in Season 2 killed someone who accused him of being a Soviet spy, now turning up dead in a park. We know what happens when something gets stuck in Stan's mind.
* After the zharkoye dinner, Elizabeth brought some home to Philip, who'd just eaten Chinese takeout. Being Elizabeth, she put it down the garbage disposal -- can't have Russian food in the house. This led to a discussion, and disagreement, over the changes happening in the Soviet Union -- a Pizza Hut opening in Moscow! -- and a testy Philip saying to Elizabeth, ""You haven't talked to anyone back home in over 20 years."" When she replied, ""Neither have you,"" he didn't answer, because of course now he has. This is going to get a lot worse before it gets better.","For the third week in a row, ""The Americans"" hosted a meeting of the Soviet culture appreciation society.",c4458255-6571-5138-b7ff-c718c6d426b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/12/arts/11americans-recap/11americans-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=51d01818a08822cd2cb3cc64ccd114b4c77354c988838e255367322d1f5e8d1f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Keri Russell, left, and Holly Taylor in ""The Americans.""",c4458255-6571-5138-b7ff-c718c6d426b0,N24News/imgs/c4458255-6571-5138-b7ff-c718c6d426b0.jpg,3
Books,"A Hard Childhood Compressed Into Poetry, With Concision and Heat",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/18/books/review/not-here-poems-hieu-minh-nguyen.html,"That said, he has made the right choices about how to write them. They feel at once raw and ruthlessly condensed, as if their first drafts were three times as long. Cliches, redundancies, the sort of details that flesh out a novel, have been sliced away, until even the talkiest prose blocks, those with the cadence of conversation, stand out, word by word: ""I can't stop talking about desire. / I used to think of it as a pane of glass I would press my face against / & then one day it came, one day I fell through."" Other poems look like skinny ribbons, unspooling down the page, or have the rectangular shape, and the segmented structure, of sonnets: variety in form, and intensity of introspection, provides the surprise that Nguyen's unvarying diction (common words, always) and his inevitable topics cannot.

Like that other charismatic Minnesotan Danez Smith, Nguyen came to poetry through live performance; his fine first book, ""This Way to the Sugar,"" appeared from a press (Write Bloody Publishing) strongly associated with spoken word. (Smith is, also, a named character in this book; the poets attend a Twin Cities drag show together.) An earlier generation of spoken word artists composed only for live performance; many did not hold up well on the page. For Nguyen -- and for others in his cohort -- things are far otherwise. The stage gave him directness and an audience, the page -- and his own intellect -- a gift for concision. Where he gets his best metaphors, only the gods can know:

In my dreams: I am foolish

I think we were there, he & I

beneath it. I think we survived.

Nguyen's stripped-down style also makes available pithy, saddened advice, almost along the lines of Philip Larkin, whose poems about hating parties, and attending parties anyway, stand behind Nguyen's decision to show his face at one more wintry gathering, ""to live / outside the warm parameters / of my loneliness,"" to make himself present ""long enough for everyone to notice / when I'm gone."" Such phrases -- and the essaylike prose poems that conclude the volume -- might leave you wondering whether Nguyen has not only more verse, but a memoir, or a book of essays, in him.

For now, though, the slim frames of poetry serve him well, and the apothegms, the quotable lines, keep coming: ""Be grateful that we bury / our dead & not leave them where they died."" ""I think the life I want / is the life I have, but how can I be sure?"" ""I describe your funeral like a party you forgot to attend. It wasn't the same without you."" It's hard for Nguyen to look squarely at his past, but harder for him to imagine a future: ""I feel furthest from wanting to live when I think of joy as some kind of destination, a two-story house around the corner with a basketball hoop in the driveway."" It's also hard to calculate the damage we do to one another, and to our children, by implying that we expect just one life course, and will not comprehend or tolerate others; and it's harder still -- not to mention more damaging -- to cut yourself off from your past.

If there is one thread that holds together all the desires and fears in this book, it is Nguyen's need to see himself not just as someone who has survived his experiences but as someone who can represent, or face, them. Nguyen has another quick metaphor, not about love but about his own writing: ""Once, I ran, face first, into a mirror / because I didn't recognize / my reflection, because I didn't see a reflection at all."" We read poetry (among many other reasons) to see ourselves, and lives like ours, reflected: If you don't see yourself in the poems you read, you have to write them.","In his collection ""Not Here,"" the poet Hieu Minh Nguyen makes art from his memories of racism and abuse.",62616450-6821-5de5-abe0-daea17b8c018,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/18/books/review/00burt2/00burt2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9809886cc62febc5c5840c1fb3f143f27be85c6d502f5c961ac46aac32015683&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Hieu Minh Nguyen,62616450-6821-5de5-abe0-daea17b8c018,N24News/imgs/62616450-6821-5de5-abe0-daea17b8c018.jpg,13
Food,A Disrupted Thanksgiving Leaves the Turkey Business Guessing,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/dining/thanksgiving-turkey-coronavirus.html,"Cooks around the country are just starting to calculate menus and decide how many guests they can safely host for Thanksgiving. But for months, the people who grow and sell the centerpiece of the meal have been doing their own kind of turkey math. Just how many whole turkeys will Americans cook this year for a holiday whose wings have been clipped by the pandemic? ""That's the big question on the tip of everybody's tongue,"" said Stew Leonard Jr., who expects to sell 20 percent fewer big turkeys at the seven stores his family owns in the Northeast. All indications are that the holiday gatherings that used to bring together dozens of people to share one or two turkeys will be scuttled in favor of smaller celebrations. That could lead to a run on small turkeys, a higher-than-usual demand for parts like whole breasts, and higher prices across the board. And although no turkey farmer likes to hear this, some cooks may simply decide to go all in on a big chicken.

Nearly 70 percent of Americans plan to celebrate Thanksgiving differently this year, according to a consumer survey released last month by the Chicago-based market research firm Numerator. The revised plans are motivated in no small part by new guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that recommend skipping holiday travel and limiting Thanksgiving celebrations to people living in the same household. Consumer research from both Butterball and Hormel Foods, which together sell most of the more than 40 million whole turkeys that are eaten for Thanksgiving, suggests that big gatherings will be broken into several smaller ones, most of which will still center on turkey. A third of the respondents to the Butterball survey said they were considering serving dinner outdoors, and the number of people who plan to host only their immediate family has jumped to 30 percent, from 18 percent last year.

Kroger executives are closely studying their own data, which show 43 percent of their shoppers will limit Thanksgiving to only the people already in their households. ""It's really the size of the celebrations that has changed,"" said Joel Brandenberger, president of the National Turkey Federation. ""How that translates to the size of the bird people want is something we are a little less clear on.""

The calculations are tricky. Contracts to buy the baby turkeys called poults are often written a year in advance, and growing those poults to the proper size for the market takes months. Even if farmers wanted to raise smaller turkeys, it's not that easy. Genetics, coupled with economically driven feed formulas, produce birds that mature at a predetermined size in a set amount of time. ""It's not an industry in which you can quickly pivot,"" said John Peterson, whose family has owned the 140-acre Ferndale Market in Cannon Falls, Minn., for 80 years. ""For us to have any meaningful impact on changing anything for Thanksgiving, those decisions had to be made in March or April."" Mr. Peterson is president of the turkey research and promotion council for Minnesota, the nation's top turkey-producing state. About a quarter of the 160,000 turkeys he will grow this year will be sold for the holidays. He is doing what he can to keep the turkeys small, like slaughtering some earlier than he might in a normal year. Cody Hopkins runs a livestock cooperative of 40 farms mostly in Arkansas, Mississippi and Missouri that will ship out about 3,000 broad-breasted whites -- by far the most common American breed -- that have been raised on pasture. He is making similar tweaks to his flock. Because the cooperative sells directly to families and isn't locked into a supermarket chain's schedule, farmers have been able to move processing timelines in an attempt to produce smaller birds, he said. The co-op is also planning to sell more turkey wings and breasts. ""We're talking about doing some bigger chickens, too, to give people options,"" Mr. Hopkins said. The pivot is harder for the nation's largest producers of whole turkeys, who are wrestling with both the health and the economic realities of Covid-19. The virus charged through some poultry packing plants at alarming rates, forcing temporary closings and a call for improved working conditions.

Still, the sellers of whole turkeys are optimistic. Mr. Leonard has increased his order for birds that weigh less than 16 pounds by 20 percent, and will add more individual turkey breasts to the mix. Instead of setting up most of his packaged Thanksgiving dinners for eight people, he is increasing the packages for four. He expects good sales overall. ""Nobody's going to skip Thanksgiving,"" he said. And shoppers, take note: Inexpensive supermarket birds, which serve as enticements called loss leaders, might be harder to find, poultry analysts say. ""We could actually see something of a run on turkeys,"" said Mark Jordan, the executive director of Leap Market Analytics, in Arkansas, who studies the turkey market. But that's not a sure bet. With unemployment at record levels, many households have tighter budgets and will likely spend less this year on Thanksgiving, some research shows. Waste, too, is top of mind. After seven months of taking their kitchens through the paces, many cooks are much more mindful of food waste. The thought of a whole turkey for only a few guests might not make sense, said Dasha Shor, a registered dietitian and food analyst who specializes in meat and meat alternatives for Mintel, a global market research company. ""There is almost this perfect storm for the whole bird,"" she said. ""The silver lining is that people are actually interested in cooking. Almost half of consumers want to cook at home, and get better at it.""

Leftover recipes and food storage tips also will be a bigger focus this year at Butterball, where research indicates that only a quarter of all consumers plan to buy smaller turkeys than usual. At its Turkey Talk-Line, which opens on Nov. 2, experts are gearing up to answer what is expected to be a flood of calls from novice hosts. (For the first time in its 39-year history, the talk-line experts will be taking calls remotely rather than from the Butterball call center and test kitchen in an office near Chicago.)

Dance,City Ballet's Season of Renewal,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/01/arts/dance/city-ballets-season-of-renewal.html,"Who is Miriam Miller? She became a member of the New York City Ballet corps only in January -- so recently, in fact, that her brief biography on the company's website has no photo attached. This is odd for two reasons. One: From the auditorium of the David H. Koch Theater, where the company finished its six-week winter season on Sunday, she appears to have the perfect, theatrically legible features of a model. Two: It's been apparent since June that she's going places. City Ballet was -- and to a large extent remains -- the domain of the choreographer George Balanchine (1904-83). Although it's been correctly said for decades that the company has room for leading women of different shapes and sizes, the ballets he created feature a number of high-prestige roles usually reserved for long-limbed, lovely, cool and unknowable apparitions whose dancing is on a naturally Titanic scale. With such women, Balanchine -- whose genius had innumerable facets -- loved to develop many aspects of his high Olympian strain. Ms Miller has the qualifications: mystery, attack, grandeur, authority and beauty. In June, when she was still an unknown apprentice, she made her debut in one of those roles: Titania in his ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" (1962). On Friday and Saturday, she gave her first performances in a more exalted part, the pas de deux of Balanchine's ""Agon"" (1957). She wasn't perfect, but she so naturally embodied the ideal for such prima roles that the question ""Who is Miriam Miller?"" was much asked over the weekend. Not since Darci Kistler (who arrived in 1980) and Maria Kowroski (who became a corps member in 1994) has a newcomer seemed so tailor-made for the goddess roles. At this stage, Ms Miller has yet to master the elusive momentum for this pas de deux -- the sense that each stop is the next start. And, as a friend observed, it looks as if she uses her upper and outer muscles rather than the inner, lower ones, giving a more stressful emphasis to her dancing.

There's no knowing what will happen. (In her late teens Ms. Kistler suffered a serious injury that lasted longer than her work with Balanchine had.) But it's exciting that City Ballet, which has sometimes been too cautious with its young charges, is venturing Ms. Miller into the stratosphere so early in her career. Throughout its recent six-week season (Jan. 19 through Feb. 28) and the preceding ""Nutcracker"" season (Nov. 27 through Jan. 3), the company was renewing itself at all levels. What's more, it isn't rigid about physical types. The most privileged of the Balanchine ballerina roles is the second movement in Balanchine's ""Symphony in C"" (1947); I'm sorry to have missed the debut in this work of the principal Sterling Hyltin, who is so gifted with amplitude that it took me years to realize that she is petite. Another role usually given to tall deities is the ballerina one in ""Mozartiana"" (1981); Ms. Hyltin's Saturday performance was a marvel of lucid musicianship, with strokes of wit and delicacy that the part has seldom seen since its originator, Ms. Farrell, danced it. The 13 Balanchine ballets in repertory this winter season were always an adventure ground. (""Who is Unity Phelan?"" people were asking eagerly after her Concerto in ""Episodes"" in the season's final week.) In the ""Symphony in C"" ultra-adagio movement at the same matinee on Saturday, Sara Mearns's authority was extraordinary: this long dance becomes a single thought, even a single phrase. I wish it didn't seem she were acting the role: she wears a drastic makeup -- dark lipstick, tragic pallor -- it has never had (or needed) before. Yet that evening she danced another pure-dance role, the blazingly allegro Sanguinic in ""The Four Temperaments,"" with unadorned simplicity and full-throttle sweep. Teresa Reichlen, at her greatest as Choleric in the Saturday evening ""Temperaments"" performance, has a few roles that suit her less well but at which it's heartening to watch her apply herself -- notably ""Walpurgisnacht Ballet."" Here's where non-Balanchine repertory can bring unsuspected qualities to the surface: Troy Schumacher's ""Common Ground"" (new last October) uses all her statuesque authority, but it also brings out an inflamed wildness that's a surprise; and it's this -- along with piquant musical playfulness -- that she's starting to develop in ""Walpurgisnacht."" Likewise, the soloist Ashley Laracey is unrecognizable in ""Common Ground""; while she exudes a bold heady fragrance here, you also follow her like a shyly inquiring mind. (It's the role in which she uses her eyes most freely.) You go from this to the refined purity of line and legato phrasing she shows in the Third Theme of ""Temperaments,"" and imagine the diversity that may lie in between. Why aren't we currently seeing her in the taxing fourth movement of ""Symphony in C""? She made a striking impression in it a few seasons ago.

What does a ballet tell us about its dancers? This is always one of the most valuable questions to ask. Both of Mr. Schumacher's creations for City Ballet have revealed their dancers in new lights; the same is true of Myles Thatcher's ""Polaris"" and Robert Binet's ""The Blue of Distance,"" which also had their premieres in October and have returned this winter. I don't mean to overpraise these pieces; yet my mind lingers in the worlds they create. I very much hope to see more by their makers. After many lean years, it's a big surprise to behold what looks like a whole new generation of gifted young choreographers. Justin Peck, undoubtedly the most sophisticated of them, has been the company's resident choreographer since last year; you can see that City Ballet's dancers believe in him from the commitment of their dancing. His February creation, ""The Most Incredible Thing,"" returns for three performances in the company's April-June season, and his ""Everywhere We Go"" (2014) for four; there'll be a new one in the company's Saratoga season in July. What his ballets tell us about his dancers will give us the best answer to the most asked of all City Ballet questions today: Who is Justin Peck?","Dancers and choreographers asserted themselves and George Balanchine's influence was obvious during the company's winter season, and will continue to be.",2a2c9bc4-b7a3-5156-a3f1-053604389602,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/01/arts/01NYCBSEASON/01NYCBSEASON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=f8fee7de1d6b8425c428d67616ae5017b823cef70d677bf9b5f57ae66694a997&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Foreground, Sterling Hyltin left, and Anthony Huxley in ""Mozartiana.""",2a2c9bc4-b7a3-5156-a3f1-053604389602,N24News/imgs/2a2c9bc4-b7a3-5156-a3f1-053604389602.jpg,6
Television,"Plenty of Fantasy in HBO's 'Chernobyl,' but the Truth Is Real",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/02/arts/television/chernobyl-hbo.html,"Henry Fountain is a science writer on the Climate desk of The New York Times. He toured the Chernobyl plant and the exclusion zone around it in 2014. The first thing to understand about the HBO mini-series ""Chernobyl,"" which concludes its five-part run on Monday, is that a lot of it is made up. But here's the second, and more important, thing: It doesn't really matter. The explosion and fire at Chernobyl's Unit 4 reactor on April 26, 1986, was an extraordinarily messy and grim event, a radioactive ""dirty"" bomb on a scale that no one -- certainly not anyone in the Soviet Union -- was prepared for. It remains the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power, killing more than 30 people initially (and more in the years that followed, though the numbers are much disputed) and spreading radioactive contamination across large swaths of Soviet and European territory. In the immediate panicked aftermath, and in the months of crisis and confusion until the completion seven months later of the concrete-and-steel sarcophagus that entombed the reactor's lethal remains, the heroes and villains numbered in the hundreds, and the supporting cast in the hundreds of thousands.

That's not to say there aren't many touches of verisimilitude. The rooftop scene in which conscripts have just seconds to toss radioactive debris to the ground is as otherworldly as it must have seemed to those who were there three decades ago. And the Unit 4 control room is faithfully re-created, from the control-rod dials on the walls to the white coats and caps worn by the operators. (When I visited the adjacent Unit 3 control room five years ago, I had to wear the same odd outfit, which seemed more appropriate for a bakery than a nuclear power plant.) But if you didn't know much about Chernobyl you could be forgiven if, after watching, you thought the entire response and cleanup was run by two people, Valery Legasov and Boris Shcherbina, aided valiantly by a third, Ulana Khomyuk. You could also be forgiven if you thought they were all real characters. Legasov and Shcherbina were real, though their roles were twisted and amplified to meet the script's need to keep things moving. Khomyuk, on the other hand, was made out of whole cloth, and her actions strain credulity, from traveling to Chernobyl, uninvited, to investigate the accident to being in the presence of Mikhail Gorbachev at the Kremlin not much later.

There are the brave, doomed firefighters, ignorant of the radiation hazards they encountered (though nobody climbed up over the reactor debris, as portrayed in the series; they were working the roof to prevent fires from spreading to the undamaged Unit 3). The plucky, can-do miners, brought in to excavate under the reactor to stop the meltdown, stripping naked to get the job done (the series doesn't say this, but their work ended up largely for naught). The no-nonsense helicopter pilots, risking radiation sickness to drop their loads of lead, boron and sand on the reactor (while one helicopter did crash, killing its crew, the accident happened months later, and radiation had nothing to do with it). I could go on. Don't get me started about that blue light from the exposed reactor shining high into the night sky in the first episode. Yes, nuclear reactors can produce a blue hue, from something called Cherenkov radiation, but no, there's no way Unit 4 would have looked like the ""Tribute in Light"" in Lower Manhattan on the anniversary of Sept. 11.

""Chernobyl"" is grim only partly because of all the destruction and death. The need to constantly lie (or cope with the lies of higher-ups) weighs on its characters as heavily as all the lead that was dropped on the reactor. Yes, this basic truth is simplified, too, especially in the final episode, which portrays the trial of three power plant officials. I don't want to give away much about these scenes, though I will reveal that the geeky term ""positive void coefficient"" -- one of the reactor's design flaws -- was uttered . (As a science writer, I was overjoyed.) The scenes have a lot of tension, and are among the best in the whole mini-series. But they seem drawn more from American movie courtrooms than from Soviet jurisprudence. The idea of someone speaking truth to power in this court seems about as far-fetched as anything else in the whole of ""Chernobyl."" How the show gets to its truth, however, is less important than that it gets there. Viewers may come away from ""Chernobyl"" realizing that, together, people and machines can do awful things -- like create a nuclear catastrophe for the ages. If they also come away understanding that in this case, that outcome was more the fault of a government and its apparatchiks, so much the better.","Ahead of the series finale, a science writer who has toured the site of the 1986 nuclear disaster weighs in.",6cf6b65c-0e16-5817-85a6-31df7284b586,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/arts/02chernobyl1/02chernobyl1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=eda7954728e3fe1b0339d03a12584c59eb1708311f6a9a5cbe4b5c572e5bbbdb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from the HBO mini-series ""Chernobyl,"" about the worst disaster in the history of nuclear power.",6cf6b65c-0e16-5817-85a6-31df7284b586,N24News/imgs/6cf6b65c-0e16-5817-85a6-31df7284b586.jpg,3
Economy,Couple's Suit Over Parental Leave Is New Challenge to Big Law Firm,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/business/economy/jones-day-lawsuit.html,"Jones Day, one of the nation's largest law firms, faced a harsh spotlight this year when six female lawyers filed a class-action complaint saying they had faced gender and pregnancy discrimination while working there and had been subjected to a ""fraternity culture."" Now the glare has intensified, with a couple formerly employed at Jones Day charging in a federal lawsuit that the firm discriminated in its parental-leave policies and that the husband was fired after he questioned the practice. The complaint, filed Tuesday, maintains that the firm and some of its partners promoted crude stereotypes about gender roles, with a prominent male partner asking rhetorically, ""What would a man do on parental leave -- watch his wife unload the dishwasher?"" The same partner, the suit claims, teased a male associate for taking parental leave to care for a child. The plaintiffs are Mark C. Savignac and Julia Sheketoff, who worked in the firm's elite appellate practice in Washington. Their lawsuit asserts that Jones Day's policy unlawfully denied Mr. Savignac the full leave he was entitled to after their son was born in January and that it unlawfully fired him when he complained about the policy.

""I was shocked; we truly never considered that they would fire me,"" Mr. Savignac said. ""We thought the law was so obvious."" Under the firm's policy, biological mothers who seek to be a primary caregiver receive 10 weeks of paid family leave plus eight weeks of disability leave, while biological fathers who seek to be a primary caregiver receive 10 weeks of family leave. The firm also awards new adoptive parents of either gender 18 weeks of paid leave if they seek to be a primary caregiver. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has held that employers can award biological mothers eight weeks more paid leave than biological fathers if the additional time is tied to their recovery from the physical toll of childbirth. But in their legal complaint, Mr. Savignac and Ms. Sheketoff argue that Jones Day awards mothers eight additional weeks of paid leave without regard to whether their physical condition warrants it. The plaintiffs write that the policy gives ""female associates more time to enable their husbands to prioritize their careers over child care"" and ""reflects and reinforces archaic gender roles and sex-based stereotypes.""

Cynthia Thomas Calvert, who advises employers about family-leave policies, said the claim's fate would hinge on determining whether the policy was intended to provide greater accommodation to recovering mothers or more time for bonding with a child. If meant to foster bonding, the time is supposed to be equal for fathers and mothers. Advocates argue that policies making it easier for fathers to assume domestic responsibilities help overcome an assumption that mothers are less devoted to their careers.

Ms. Calvert said that the fact that adoptive parents receive the same amount of paid leave as biological mothers supported the plaintiffs' argument that the leave was for bonding, but that this fact was not decisive. A policy like Jones Day's does not appear to have been tested in court, but in 2015 CNN settled an analogous case with a biological father. David Lopez, a former general counsel of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, said Mr. Savignac appeared to have a strong claim that his firing was unlawful. Mr. Savignac was fired three business days after he and Ms. Sheketoff said in an email to the firm that the leave policy was discriminatory, and he had previously earned strong performance reviews, according to the complaint.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Jones Day defended its policy, saying it grants birth mothers eight weeks of paid disability leave to avoid having to ask for medical evidence that they are still recovering from childbirth. The firm said the firing of Mr. Savignac had not been in retaliation for criticizing the leave policy, which it said he and Ms. Sheketoff had done in 2018 without repercussions. Rather, it said, it fired him because he had shown a ""lack of courtesy"" to colleagues and an ""open hostility to the firm,"" citing his email. The firm also said its adoption-leave policy reflected the unique demands that adoptive parents can face, like foreign travel and legal proceedings. Jones Day's policy is at odds with a trend in which companies are increasingly eliminating the distinction between fathers and mothers or primary and secondary caregivers. They award all employees the same amount of family leave for a new child, though women who give birth can sometimes receive additional time to recover through disability leave.

Jones Day has risen to prominence in recent years thanks partly to its ties to President Trump, whose campaigns it has represented. Several lawyers joined the administration from the firm, including Donald F. McGahn II, Mr. Trump's first White House counsel. Mr. Savignac said he had been on parental leave for a few weeks when the firm emailed to say that he was fired, effective that day. He said that he asked Ms. Sheketoff to sit down and hand him their infant, for fear she might drop the baby upon hearing the news.

According to the lawsuit, after Jones Day fired Mr. Savignac, it refused to allow two partners who had worked closely with him and previously praised his work to recommend him to prospective employers. Mr. Savignac said he had applied to dozens of firms without receiving an offer before accepting an offer in June. Ms. Sheketoff left the firm while pregnant last year to work for a public defender's office, where she took a substantial pay cut. Separately, the couple contends that the firm paid Ms. Sheketoff less than it would have paid a man because of her gender. The complaint says that Ms. Sheketoff received a smaller raise than she otherwise would have in 2017 after a negative evaluation from a male partner who scolded her for being insufficiently deferential. The partner did not scold male associates who failed to defer to him, according to the complaint. Jones Day denied that it had discriminated against Ms. Sheketoff and said that ""her reviews from multiple partners were mixed."" Ms. Sheketoff was at Jones Day for almost four years, and Mr. Savignac was there about 20 months. Their allegations echo those in the class-action complaint against Jones Day, filed in April, that spoke of a ""fraternity culture."" That lawsuit, pending in federal court, contends that women who give birth face obstacles to advancement at the firm and that women who have a second child are often asked to leave within a few months of returning to work.","Jones Day is accused of unlawfully dismissing a lawyer who questioned a gender disparity in its policies, and underpaying his wife when she worked there.",0a1dc6ae-564c-5468-a860-0db898daff90,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/13/business/13jonesday1/13jonesday1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b5cf2e9a1407c045d8f27403e6fcd6a8c2feb1e1135e67919d0684276b094c02&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julia Sheketoff and Mark Savignac at home with their son, Henry.

Movies,'Cut Throat City' Review: Desperate Straits in Post-Katrina New Orleans,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/movies/cut-throat-city-review.html,"The new movie ""Cut Throat City,"" directed by RZA, whose artistic renown began with the hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, opens as heist pictures sometimes do -- with some friends talking things over. The four guys don't yet know that they're going to become criminals. Rather, they're discussing a graphic novel that one of them, Blink (Shameik Moore), is drafting. Blink's description of it reminds them of their favorite movies. They mention the ""realness"" of ""The Godfather"" and side-eye the overuse of a racial epithet in some Quentin Tarantino movies.

In their everyday New Orleans lives, Blink and his crew are hopeful strivers; after Hurricane Katrina hits, they're in desperate straits.

Opinion,Bishop Budde: Trump's Visit to St. John's Church Outraged Me,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/trump-st-johns-church-protests.html,"Instead, Mr. Trump used sacred symbols to cloak himself in the mantle of spiritual authority, while espousing positions antithetical to the Bible that he held in his hands. That's why I drew the line, as did my colleague Archbishop Wilton Gregory when the very next day Mr. and Mrs. Trump made an unannounced visit to the Saint John Paul II National Shrine.

Had the president opened the Bible he was holding, he could have read passages calling on us to love God and our neighbor, to seek God in the face of strangers and even to love our enemies. He could have read exhortations calling us all to the highest standard of love, which is justice. He could have even recited texts that warn faith leaders like me about the sin of hypocrisy. Scripture is clear that God is not impressed by prayers unaccompanied by sustained efforts to create a more loving world. ""Let justice roll down like waters,"" God says through the prophet Amos, ""and righteousness like an ever-flowing stream.""

Scripture is clear: Justice, which is the societal expression of love, matters most to God. Justice is also what is most important to those who are exercising their right to peaceful protest. They are expressing what we all know to be true: It's past time to fix a law that allows police officers and vigilantes to go unpunished for crimes against people of color. It's past time to correct the gross disparities in health care that Covid-19 has revealed. It's past time to change economic and educational systems that privilege white people.

Like everyone else, people of faith are not of one mind -- my email inbox this week is evidence of that. We show up on every side of every issue. Often we prefer to take no side at all, for fear of offending, or stepping out of our lane, or failing to love everyone without distinction. But there are times when taking a side, and a stand, is precisely what's needed from people of faith. For me, now is such a time. I stand with those engaged in peaceful protest, calling for meaningful change, and especially with young Americans who rightfully wonder if there is hope for their future.

This is a crucible moment. By grace and with courage, I believe that we can rise to meet it, and we must. The God I serve is on the side of justice. Jesus calls his followers to emulate his example of sacrificial love and to build what he called the Kingdom of God on earth. In this moment, Presiding Bishop Michael Curry challenges us to ask, ""What would the sacrificial love of Jesus look like now?""","While the president cloaks himself in spiritual authority, he preaches the antithesis.",d88e4293-76cd-5636-af03-8ab8e48d6863,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/04/opinion/04Buddle/04Buddle-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a505f5d0fb6eaa40a3578d5e23721a73585230f18d91c69e94e1a9eea94ce768&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"After having police and National Guard units disperse protestors with flash-bang and tear gas munitions, President Trump posed for media with a bible in front of St. John's Church.",d88e4293-76cd-5636-af03-8ab8e48d6863,N24News/imgs/d88e4293-76cd-5636-af03-8ab8e48d6863.jpg,11

* None  Tess Ward, a model and a cook, doesn't think food should be fussy. But she loves a pretty dish. Lauren Fleishman for The New York Times

Riotous hues are no longer expected just on the runway, but also on the plate. ""I want it to look like the rainbow,"" the English model and cook Tess Ward has said of her average meal. Not because of the toddler dictum ""eat your colors"" appropriated by health-conscious grown-ups, but to render it fit for Instagram, where her feed has been filled of late with photographs of a red and yellow tomato salad; a luridly magenta beetroot curry; and an icy green cantaloupe melon with a snow-like dusting of feta. (Woe betide cozy old gray porridge which now must be gussied up with seeds and fruits and presented in wholesome ""bowls."") ""You don't have to be perfect; you don't have to be someone who only has green smoothies for breakfast,"" Ms. Ward last year told a crowd of mostly female fans at an event for Sweaty Betty, the active-wear company. Privately she has referred to herself as Messy Tessie. ""Give me the biscuits!"" ""You are so refreshing,"" the presenter said, ""so refreshing."" The fashion industry has long adopted artists and musicians but has been slower to warm to food personalities; Ms. Ward, 28, seems to satisfy its bottomless hunger for novelty and kinetic motion. She has been pictured in a protective crouch in the passenger seat of the heartthrob singer Harry Styles's car, crossed the Atlantic to oversee dinners for brands like Chloe and Mulberry, and worked as ""brand ambassador"" for Dolce & Gabbana and Michael Kors -- no cooking required. This September Ms. Ward is sitting out the New York shows, traveling to among other places Lake Como, Italy, where she posed in underwear on her hotel bed (why not), and Greece . Toward fashion week's rituals she is irreverent if not indifferent. ""All the people outside -- it's sort of weird,"" she said of the street-style hordes. ""It attracts a very strange crowd."" She doesn't like fashion criticism either. ""The element of reviewing someone's creation! I think you can select the pieces that serve you well. I don't think you have to critique them so much."" Saucily named ""The Naked Diet"" and published in 2015, Ms. Ward's first cookbook itself received mixed reviews. ""I wanted to call it 'The Natural Pantry,'"" she said with some regret. ""It was a playful way of saying you don't really have to complicate your food to make it colorful and delicious."" The sequel is tentatively titled ""Filthy Healthy Cravings"": a compromise, perhaps, between recent salad-centric compendia and the permissive indulgence of Chrissy Teigen's cookbooks. Born in Tooting, South London, Ms. Ward has paid unusual attention to food since she was a baby, when at her christening party, she said, ""I was passed around by the guests and only interested in the scones in their hands and the champagne in their glasses."" She studied art history at the University of Leeds and cooking at Le Cordon Bleu in Paris. ""But the techniques they teach you are just dated and not very exciting. Very old-school French: way too much butter, quenelles and you make mushroom duxelles and you learn how to chop brunoise, julienne in everything, how to, like, sieve. Mousses. Oh my God, like, dealing with aspic. It feels like a lifetime ago now."" She prefers the more casual approach of current British author-chefs like Yotam Ottolenghi and Nigel Slater. ""He is very sensual in his writing, very inviting in the way he talks about food, and it's very much about pleasure,"" she said of Mr. Slater. ""You feel very caressed when you read him."" Yet Ms. Ward is ready to shed her come-hither nickname, the Yes Chef. ""It started as a little bit of a joke because 'yes, chef' is what you say in a kitchen taking an order,"" she said. ""I'm actually trying to phase it out because it's not really on point for what I'm doing. I'm Tess and I cook. That's enough now, you know?""",The English model-cook Tess Ward champions imperfection.

Real Estate,Panoramic Hudson Views for $13.17 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/realestate/panoramic-hudson-views-for-13-17-million.html,"A loft-like apartment on the seventh floor of 150 Charles Street, the Witkoff Group's condominium in the West Village that sold all 91 luxury units just a few weeks after sales opened three years ago, officially closed for $13,172,500.71, according to city records, and was the most expensive sale of the week.

Sports,"Giannis Antetokounmpo Is N.B.A. Must-See TV, and Maybe the M.V.P.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/03/sports/basketball/giannis-antetokounmpo-milwaukee-bucks-mvp.html,"LOS ANGELES -- The evolution of Giannis Antetokounmpo into a global star has been playing out for six seasons. It manifests in soaring dunks, or blocked shots from the weak side that defy logic, or wraparound passes to an open shooter, or crossover dribbles that leave defenders reeling in his impossibly long-limbed wake. But Pat Connaughton, a reserve guard, did not have the opportunity to witness Antetokounmpo's feats on a daily basis until last summer, when he signed with the Milwaukee Bucks and joined his new teammates for scrimmages ahead of training camp. ""You'd see him do something ridiculous, and I'd be looking around and nobody would be reacting,"" Connaughton recalled. ""Like, 'Did you guys not just see that?'"" For the players who have been around Antetokounmpo the longest, there may be an element of genius fatigue at work -- not that they take him for granted. Malcolm Brogdon, a third-year guard, tried to provide some context for Connaughton at one of those early scrimmages.

""You'll get used to it after a while,"" Brogdon told him. ""It happens all the time."" Antetokounmpo, 24, has turned the sublime into the routine. But the novelty has not worn off for N.B.A. fans, who have made him appointment viewing this season, and the Bucks have shaped themselves into contenders by following his lead. On top of that, nearly two years after Kobe Bryant, the retired Los Angeles Lakers guard, challenged Antetokounmpo to win the league's Most Valuable Player Award, he may be on the verge of upending the Eastern Conference to do so.

""Everything you see about him or hear about him is how hard he works,"" Lakers Coach Luke Walton said, ""and how great he wants to be."" The Bucks improved their league-best record to 48-14 after coming from behind to defeat the Lakers on Friday night at Staples Center. Antetokounmpo, who has been dealing with right knee soreness, finished with 16 points and 15 rebounds in the Bucks' 131-120 win, which qualified as a quiet effort for him. But he had his moments. Early in the fourth quarter, he sized up Mike Muscala, his 6-foot-11 defender, at the top of the perimeter. He took a couple of hard dribbles into the paint, threw his right shoulder into Muscala to knock him off balance, then dunked over him with his left hand.

""Unbelievable guy,"" Antetokounmpo said of Gasol. ""He's been to the finals. He has so much experience. I think he's definitely going to help us."" The Bucks are readying for a playoff run with Antetokounmpo as their focal point. Entering their game against the Utah Jazz on Saturday night, Antetokounmpo was averaging 26.8 points, 12.6 rebounds and 5.9 assists while shooting 57.9 percent from the field. ""When the season started, we knew we had something special -- we had a great team,"" he said. ""But to be honest with you, no, I never thought we were going to have the best record in the N.B.A. ""But I think we've worked hard for it, we go out there and show up for every game, and we try to win every game."" There is no apt historical comparison for Antetokounmpo because the league has never seen anyone quite like him. He is too long and too strong, too quick and too skilled, a 6-foot-11 power forward who can defend point guards at one end and post up the league's stoutest centers at the other. As for Antetokounmpo's unique athleticism, Connaughton considers him to be something of a hybrid of Kevin Durant of the Golden State Warriors and LeBron James of the Lakers.

""He's got the length of K.D.,"" Connaughton said, ""but now he's at the point where he's got the strength of LeBron -- or at least he's on that trajectory. And that speaks volumes about his work ethic and his desire to be the best that he can be. Because not a lot of guys with that talent work that hard."" Connaughton, whose playing time has fluctuated this season, often goes to the team's practice facility on off days for extra shooting and conditioning work. Antetokounmpo, Connaughton said, is always there, too. He is a gym rat in the second year of a four-year, $100 million contract. Connaughton joined the Bucks after three seasons with the Portland Trail Blazers, and he said Antetokounmpo plays with the same motor -- the same mind-set -- as Damian Lillard, the Blazers' All-Star point guard. ""Obviously Dame is a different player, but I think they share an inner desire,"" Connaughton said. ""It has nothing to do with the outside. It has nothing to do with the media, the attention or the press. Like, they're in it for their own reasons -- the right reasons, in my opinion."" Whenever Budenholzer is asked about it, which is often these days, he makes a compelling case for Antetokounmpo as the N.B.A.'s most valuable player -- and he cites his defense as Exhibit A. Antetokounmpo is so dynamic on offense, Budenholzer said, that it tends to overshadow everything else is does. Sure enough, he had three blocked shots against the Lakers. Antetokounmpo is not going to create headlines with bold predictions -- after Friday's win, he repeated familiar mantras about taking it ""day by day"" and continuing to ""work hard"" -- but the Bucks must be thinking big. All around them, powerhouse teams are struggling. Even the Warriors, the two-time defending champions, have had issues. Few thought the Bucks would be this good this quickly, but everyone was saying the same thing about Antetokounmpo when he entered the league at age 19. Suddenly, the future is now.","Nearly two years after he was challenged to win the league's Most Valuable Player Award, the Bucks star may be on the verge of upending the Eastern Conference to do so.",d10e1dd1-a331-5322-8f0a-ed7eb5eea9bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/sports/03giannis-print1/03giannis-print1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a9c64fc40ea5c7ef47378a7a7ab2330941cdf87195a6c3a3d4d0f391d2b7e838&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo has taken over the Eastern Conference and, perhaps, the entire N.B.A.",d10e1dd1-a331-5322-8f0a-ed7eb5eea9bf,N24News/imgs/d10e1dd1-a331-5322-8f0a-ed7eb5eea9bf.jpg,9

'TRAVISVILLE' at Ensemble Studio Theater (in previews; opens on Oct. 12). William Jackson Harper, a longtime Off Broadway favorite and more recently a sitcom star, makes his playwriting debut.

ensemblestudiotheatre.org 'THUNDERBODIES' at Soho Rep (previews start on Oct. 16; opens on Oct. 27). The war is over and everything is weird in America, including the weather.

Food,"New Reasons (Cookies, Pizza) to Go to Greenpoint",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/dining/restaurants-greenpoint-brooklyn.html,"It was only a matter of time before Greenpoint became a magnet for restaurants.

Real Estate,Shopping for Holiday Gifts,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/20/realestate/shopping-for-holiday-gifts.html,"Choosing memorable gifts for family and friends involves more than just checking names off a list. ""The point is to stop and think about who you're shopping or making something for,"" said David Stark, a Brooklyn-based event designer who recently conceived a temporary holiday gift shop inspired by the upcoming movie The Greatest Showman at the Manhattan boutique Story. ""Your gift is an expression of how you think about that person.""

That doesn't mean every gift needs to be life-changing. ""If it's a practical person and you know they're jonesing for a new screwdriver set, you can make that person really happy,"" Mr. Stark said. Or if the gift is for someone who admires luxury goods but usually balks at the prices, he continued, ""it's an opportunity to give a treat that they would never offer themselves.""

To make it a bigger surprise, Mr. Stark likes to wrap his gifts in material that doesn't come from the holiday aisle -- craft paper (which can be stamped or painted), newspaper, arty pages pulled from magazines, butcher's twine, yarn and scraps of fabric.","Finding the right present requires thought and creativity.

Television,"Review: HBO's 'Avenue 5,' a Tale of a Fateful Trip (in Space)",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/17/arts/television/avenue-5-review-hbo.html,"How far is Armando Iannucci's new HBO comedy, ""Avenue 5,"" from his previous one, ""Veep""? About a billion miles, give or take, or the distance from earth to Saturn, where the spaceship of the title is thrown off course, greatly increasing the time its load of unlucky tourists will have to spend on their interplanetary cruise.

Set 40 years in the future aboard a vessel that looks like a cross between the Starship Enterprise and a high-end mall, Iannucci's new show would seem to be a radical departure from the acrid, of-the-moment political satire of ""Veep"" and his earlier British series ""The Thick of It."" (Several of those shows' writers, including Simon Blackwell, Tony Roche and Will Smith, have joined him on ""Avenue 5."")

But there are recognizably Iannuccian things about this space-com, which debuts Sunday. Like the politicians and operatives guiding the ship of state in ""Veep,"" the crew members of the Avenue 5 are an often amoral, small-minded and quarrelsome bunch whose constant sniping provides the bulk of the humor. Leading them is a captain, played by the ""Veep"" alumnus Hugh Laurie, who, like Vice President Selina Meyer, is not ideally qualified for his post.

And there does seem to be satirical intent in ""Avenue 5,"" although one of the show's major problems, through four of the season's nine episodes, is that it's hard to tell what the targets are.","Armando Iannucci's new comedy, starring Hugh Laurie as the captain of an interplanetary cruise ship, is a long, long way from ""Veep.""",fced48d4-b89f-5b4f-b9c2-bd072f6a9ff6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/17/arts/17avenue/17avenue-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2822b39c62cf4b1077296b1a176e096e1b2ba53f05f3e77b940d3857007f482d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hugh Laurie plays the captain of an interplanetary cruise ship 40 years in the future in ""Avenue 5,"" Armando Iannucci's first HBO comedy since ""Veep,"" which also featured Laurie.",fced48d4-b89f-5b4f-b9c2-bd072f6a9ff6,N24News/imgs/fced48d4-b89f-5b4f-b9c2-bd072f6a9ff6.jpg,3
Automobiles,Driven | 2015 Toyota Camry,https://www.nytimes.com/video/automobiles/autoreviews/100000003266674/2015-toyota-camry.html,"Camry. The name roughly translates to the Japanese word for crown. And it is the king of sales, being the best selling passenger car in the U.S. for the past 12 years running. I'm Tom Voelk with Driven for The New York Times. Never a design statement, common descriptors have been vanilla, bland, and appliance. The 2015 model adds some pizzazz. French vanilla perhaps? (ON CAMERA) Toyota had to respond to the in-class competition, since Fusion, Optima, Mazda6, and Chrysler 200 have become very pretty darn attractive. On the other hand I've talked to some current Camry owners that are perfectly happy with the old not so bold look. And Toyota can't alienate them. It walks that tightrope well. Camry's new duds eliminate the slab side. The boldest element clearly has Lexus ""spindle grille"" envy, though Toyota says the family resemblance is coincidental. Delicate lines on the hood dress to impress but the faux window insert is the equivalent of a pocket protector. (ON CAMERA) The powertrains are carried over. There's a 178 horsepower four- cylinder, a hybrid, and what I'm driving. This 3.5L V6 makes 268 horsepower (SOUND UP) gas only Camrys get a six speed automatic. SE and XSE models have paddle shifters. Cars are not just about design (SOUND UP) the V6 does the dash to 60 in about six seconds flat. (ON CAMERA) This Camry's platform was pretty much carried over from the platform before it, and its platform was pretty much carried over from the Camry before that one. Toyota says 22 new spot welds to the structure add a full percent of torsional rigidity to the chassis. XSE is the sportiest Camry, ride quality is firm and bumps are felt. There's not much road feel. (ON CAMERA) The steering weight is on the light side, I'd like a little more heft. Body movements are nicely controlled in corners. But if you want the handling of a BMW or GTI, buy a BMW or GTI. Driving enthusiasts will find rivals Mazda6, Fusion, Passat and Accord more engaging to pilot. With more sound insulation, Camry is moderately quiet. Keep in mind this XSE and XLE models add a laminated noise-reducing windshield when ordered with the V6. Fuel economy remains the same from the outgoing model. The dashboard is carried over from the last Camry but the center stack is redesigned. Controls are nicely laid out and easy to read. All in all it's pretty straight forward in here, that's not a bad thing since that includes the Entune user interface. Take a phone call and radio broadcasts buffer in memory, then resumes when you hang up. XSEs microsuede material feels good and provides grip when cornering hard. Decent bolstering helps too. (ON CAMERA) Need a good-sized back seat. Camry delivers. Head knee and leg room are generous. I would like a little more foot room though. Competitors Optima and Sonata offer the option of rump roasters back here. There's no power port but the expected storage spots are here. Passat and Accord's rear quarters might be a little roomier but this should satisfy most families. (ON CAMERA) A roomy trunk is important in this segment, otherwise you might as we ll by a crossover. That segment recently outsold sedans for the first time ever. Seats fold, but not completely flat. It helps to make the trunk more useful, and seven packs of the two- ply is better than average. No grab handle means hands can get dirty, and be careful, the trunk arms can squeeze cargo. Prices start at $23,800. Equipped with smart cruise control, pre-collision system and blind spot warning, this loaded car retails for about $35,200. The quick restyling of this sedan speaks volumes about how white-hot this segment is. While I wouldn't call it bold, the new design should keep loyal owners from straying, so Camry can keep its sales crown.","America's best-selling sedan gets a new suit of clothes, but keeps its familiar personality.",805b51-5f58-5206-913a-075509498605,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/02/multimedia/driven-toyota-camry/driven-toyota-camry-articleLarge.jpg?video-overlay?video-overlay?video-overlay?video-overlay,2015 Toyota Camry.,805b51-5f58-5206-913a-075509498605,N24News/imgs/805b51-5f58-5206-913a-075509498605.jpg,23
Style,Where the Real Los Angeles Meets the Dream,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/20/style/sunset-boulevard-los-angeles.html,"On Sunset Boulevard, two Californias -- the lived place and the one seen on screen -- run parallel for 22 snaking miles.

Where the Real Los Angeles Meets the Dream

Like Broadway in New York and Ocean Drive in Miami,  It's where you go to gas up at the Arco station (5007 Sunset Boulevard) or grab a meal at In-N-Out Burger (7009 Sunset), and also to chase the dream of fame and eternal sunshine. Remarkably, Sunset lives up to the postcard. Drive east to west, from where the street begins downtown to where it ends 22 twisting miles later at the Pacific Ocean, and at any point along the route, you will see the images that movies, TV shows and magazines have implanted in your brain.

In Hollywood, there are always weird Hollywood people, and tourists hoping to see weird Hollywood people, walking around near where Sunset meets Vine. The Sunset Strip does in fact have giant billboards in the sky advertising the latest blockbuster movie and all the famous nightclubs whose names (The Roxy, 9009 Sunset; the Viper Room, 8852 Sunset) you may know from watching ""E! True Hollywood Story.""

When you see the line of tall palm trees arcing over the pink facade of the Beverly Hills Hotel (9641 Sunset), the whole thing becomes undeniable: Sunset Boulevard is a visual cliche of itself. Is that so bad? Not at all. It can even be strange and wonderful and moving, as shown through these photographs by Jake Michaels, who drove the length of Sunset with his camera. He wanted to capture the ""microcultures"" the boulevard passes through on its journey to the beach. But in documenting daily life there, Mr. Michaels inevitably captured the myth, too.

Shooting from inside his car, on a bright day, he found a guy in black leather astride a motorcycle, waiting for a light to change near the Hollywood Palladium (6215 Sunset). ""The Palladium in the background, the motorcycle, the palm trees, the blue sky -- it's almost like the establishing shot in a movie,"" Mr. Michaels said. Deeper into West Hollywood, he encountered two rocker guys in a black Corvette Stingray, looking like they'd just left band rehearsal for Faster Pussycat. For some, it will forever be 1986 on the Sunset Strip. There's an odd timelessness to the image -- an evocation of the real-life present and an eternal music video of the mind.

Farther east, in Echo Park, another sneakily haunting image surfaced: a man and woman cruising in an old burgundy Ford Galaxie 500, California car culture personified. He looks laid-back cool behind the wheel in sunglasses and a Curtis Mayfield leather cap. But with its sun streaks, soft focus and off-kilter framing, the photo has a fleeting, ethereal quality. Like a ghost image of the east side 30 years earlier, before the waves of gentrification, or the present moment glimpsed in its impermanence.

Mr. Michaels's most self-reflective image in his estimation was one he took outside Amoeba Music (6400 Sunset), back in Hollywood. He spotted a teenage couple there one night and began talking to them. It was the couple's anniversary, they told him. They'd come to buy records, and couldn't wait to go home and listen to music together. Photographed walking and holding hands, the boy wears a kind of military jacket and a wisp of mustache, the girl a vintage fur coat and waves of long brown curls. Like the rockers, they are present-day figures from another decade. It could be 1974, or 2018. As Mr. Michaels put it: ""The future goes on, but the past stays present.""

It brought him back to his own teenage years hanging out on the Sunset Strip in the early 2000s, and confirmed how some places enliven and elevate otherwise typical moments. A couple of regular teenagers out together becomes an iconic portrait of young love. Why? Because it's on Sunset Boulevard.","On Sunset Boulevard, two Californias — the lived place and the one seen on screen — run parallel for 22 snaking miles.",a5beabc2-0797-56ce-b2c7-33cd7c1b3dd0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/21/fashion/21THELOOK4/21THELOOK4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=b1a2935faf642265684a26cbc30b4b19ebc5617acbff1e961d69e69ce7c7d7ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles is both a real street and a myth.,a5beabc2-0797-56ce-b2c7-33cd7c1b3dd0,N24News/imgs/a5beabc2-0797-56ce-b2c7-33cd7c1b3dd0.jpg,15
Style,50 Years of Marriage and Mindfulness With Nena and Robert Thurman,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/20/style/robert-nena-thurman-buddhism-woodstock-home.html,"WOODSTOCK, N.Y. -- The lawn goldfish, to use Ganden Thurman's name for his parents' three temple dogs, were trailing Nena Thurman in a wheezing cortege. Ms. Thurman's husband, Robert Thurman, the Buddhist scholar and activist, made his way down the twisting stairs of their idiosyncratic handmade house, and the two settled into a well-worn sofa, the dogs strewed on the floor. Dr. Thurman, the professor of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist studies at Columbia University and the president of Tibet House US, a cultural institution that is three decades old this year, has a book to promote, a biography in graphic-novel form of the Dalai Lama called ""Man of Peace."" Dense with East Asian history, it's not quite ""Persepolis"" or ""Fun Home,"" but it is a thrill to come upon cartoon versions of hometown political figures like Nancy Pelosi, Dianne Feinstein and Barack Obama (you'll even find Whoopi Goldberg near the end, in a hilarious panel where the Dalai Lama praises her dreadlocks and she praises his bald pate). Nonetheless, its contemporary exposition is one Mr. Thurman hopes will newly popularize the exiled Tibetan leader's life story among millennials.

In the meantime, the publication of the graphic novel, which Dr. Thurman wrote with William Meyers and Michael G. Burbank, and is either his 20th or 21st book -- he isn't quite sure, given his prodigious output of scholarly works and translations -- is the latest example of the long and successful family business that is the Robert and Nena partnership. They will celebrate their half-century anniversary in July, though this former model, now 76, and this former monk, now 75, were once voted by their friends as the couple least likely to succeed. In 1961, Dr. Thurman was a senior at Harvard, ""a New York City-bred WASP,"" as he put it, who had run away from Exeter, his boarding school, to join Fidel Castro's army, though he didn't get much farther than Mexico. He was married to Christophe de Menil, a daughter of the art world patron Dominique de Menil, and they had a baby girl, Taya, when he lost the sight in his left eye changing a flat tire. He then set off for Mexico and India, in search of verities he hoped would be more durable and more eternal than those presented by his upbringing. His wife was understandably not eager to bring a new baby on her husband's vision quest, and the couple parted ways. Dr. Thurman was just 23 when he was introduced to the Dalai Lama, then 29. A crackerjack linguist, Dr. Thurman had learned Tibetan in 10 weeks, and the two became ""talking partners,"" as the Dalai Lama liked to say. The Tibetan leader was interested in interrogating Dr. Thurman on Freud and other thinkers in the contemporary Western canon, while Dr. Thurman was eager for the Dalai Lama's insights into the dharma. The older man ordained the younger as a Tibetan monk, the first known Westerner to take the necessary 253 vows.

Nena von Schlebrugge's quest for larger truths began when she was a schoolgirl of 14 in Stockholm. ""No one there was even asking the right questions,"" she said. Scouted by Norman Parkinson, the British fashion photographer, and then recruited by Eileen Ford, a founder of Ford Models, Ms. von Schlebrugge became a successful, if ambivalent, model, arriving in New York City after a rough passage on the Queen Mary. (Photos of her at the time show just how much the actress Uma Thurman resembles her mother.) Unimpressed with uptown mores, she found a salubrious crowd in Greenwich Village, which included the poets Gregory Corso and Allen Ginsberg. One night, she, Mr. Corso and others rented a car and drove up to Cambridge, Mass., where a Harvard professor named Timothy Leary was testing the effects of small doses of mescaline. She remembered Dr. Leary, 20 years her senior, as being boring and overweight. Yet a few years later, she married him. ""I must have been hallucinating,"" she said, ""but it turns out I had a father complex, which I got completely cured of."" She and Dr. Thurman met in the kitchen at Millbrook, the New York estate given to Dr. Leary, Richard Alpert and their followers by scions of the Mellon family. She was there to persuade Dr. Leary to sign their divorce papers. Dr. Thurman was there to persuade Dr. Leary to stop taking so many drugs -- though he too had indulged in a bit of hallucination. Dr. Thurman was not looking his best: He had thrown kerosene on a brush fire and his face was covered in soot. He had given up being a monk, and the hair on his shaved head had just begun to grow in.

Yet Dr. Thurman ""had all kinds of answers and interesting questions and new ideas,"" Ms. Thurman said, and learning about Buddhism felt like ""deja vu."" ""Life is full of serendipitous happenings. It's like a skateboard is hovering just outside your door. You can close the door, or you can jump on and take the ride."" Money was tight for the ex-monk and the ex-model. Dr. Thurman spent some weeks trying to be a waiter, but his bad eye led to serving calamities, like the time he tipped a salad into a woman's handbag (though she was drinking heavily and didn't notice, he said). At the urging of his family, Dr. Thurman returned to Harvard, where he earned his Ph.D. in Buddhology. ""'In the '60s, you guys thought you knew everything,"" the admissions director said to him. ""You wrote, 'infinite leave of absence,' and now you're back.'"" ""How do you know it wasn't infinite?"" Dr. Thurman replied. Ms. Thurman had a small inheritance, and the couple bought nine acres on a hill here in Woodstock for $7,000, cleared the land and put up a few tents and a tepee. When the VW Microbus in which they had traveled through India died, it became a planter. Then Dr. Thurman had a commission to translate a Tibetan sutra. He saved $3,000 to build a house, Ms. Thurman said, ""which was enough to either hire people and dig a cellar, or buy lumber -- we decided to buy the lumber."" Dr. Thurman's most recent book, a biography of the Dalai Lama in graphic-novel form. They began with a post-and-beam cabin, sketched out by Dr. Thurman and added to in fits and starts by his children, other family members and graduate students pressed into service over the years. Visiting lamas urged them on. ""A triumph of American do-how over know-how,"" Ganden Thurman, now the executive director of Tibet House, likes to say. ""My father is maybe not a master carpenter. His tendency is to solve problems with a liberal application of force.""

""Why do it right when you can do it yourself?"" he likes to tease his father. Robert Thurman will reply: ""Why do it yourself when you can pay someone else to screw it up for you?"" They named the place Punya House -- ""punya"" means ""merit"" in Sanskrit -- though Ms. Thurman's brother, recruited on weekends to work, called the cellar he was digging the Gulag. Taya Thurman, Dr. Thurman's eldest daughter, said, ""You can see that my dad's house was drawn and made by hand, which is a beautiful feeling."" Inspired by Buckminster Fuller, a hero of Dr. Thurman's, he topped the cabin with a geodesic dome built from shingles and plexiglass. (You can see this iteration of the place in ""Woodstock Handmade Houses,"" the indie classic from 1974.) But it leaked badly. And the couple needed more rooms for their four children, Ganden, Dechen, Uma and Mipam. So Dr. Thurman took it down and built a second floor. By then, he was a professor at Amherst College, where the Buddhist family found themselves outliers among his conservative colleagues, whose hobbies ran to hunting, golf and baseball. One professor, an avid hunter, ended up teaching a course with Dr. Thurman on the karma of killing animals. ""You've ruined my life,"" he said in a toast years later. ""Now every fall when I go hunting, I keep missing!'"" The Thurman children drank goat milk from a nearby farm and dealt with being different in other ways.

On the second floor, beams were painted with lotus flowers and other so-called lucky signs. In an anteroom, there is a wall of 500 or 600 Tibetan sutras, each wrapped in a bright orange cloth, that Dr. Thurman has promised the Dalai Lama he will translate. Finally, up another twisting staircase, a 16-sided bedroom is overseen by a fearsome, gilded figure with 16 feet. ""I call it the terminator exterminator,"" he said, ""because it's a fierce symbol of overcoming death."" He explained how the theory of relativity is expressed in the 16 emptinesses that are the core of Buddhist teachings. ""The relative universe means there is no absolute container,"" he said. ""And so we are empty of any isolated, separated identity, if you follow me. We are a complete nexus of interrelatedness, which means there is nothing to do but improve."" Ms. Thurman, meanwhile, had some tips for successful marriage. ""If you share a spiritual outlook,"" she said, ""it's an area you can return to when you are having your petty struggles, which are nonsense compared to what you really care about. On a practical note, you have to take turns, so that no one partner becomes dominant in the relationship."" Ganden Thurman had another theory about his parents, gleaned from reading about some early work at the MIT Media lab having to do with interactivity, and the essential elements of human conversation.. ""Turns out it's a high degree of mutual interruptibility,"" he said. ""You had to have a high tolerance for that in my family. There were always a lot of ideas -- and grudges, too -- pouring forth. Being somewhat social oddballs who were often left to our own devices, we became, as people who are marooned together often do, a little funky.""",The prominent Buddhist couple celebrate an important anniversary in the idiosyncratic house where they raised four children.,c7aedcd4-1580-5b32-ab05-9bcab33c60da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/fashion/21THURMANSCV/21THURMANSCV-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=289fb7571255bc6297178cb1f55c18dbcccb44c56eb3b834a20421bb9e8d1bc5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nena and Robert Thurman in their home in Woodstock, N.Y.",c7aedcd4-1580-5b32-ab05-9bcab33c60da,N24News/imgs/c7aedcd4-1580-5b32-ab05-9bcab33c60da.jpg,15

Your Money,Easing the Transition From One Nanny to the Next,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/09/your-money/easing-the-transition-from-one-nanny-to-the-next.html,"OVER the last 12 years, Donna Levin has come to know exactly what she needs in a nanny: someone on her way to or in graduate school who has an interest in children and a flexible class schedule. But given that demographic, she also knows there is going to be a lot of turnover. Most of her nannies stay for a little over a year, she said, and the one she has now, a pre-med student, will depart in a few weeks. ""The current transition is one of those very positive yet painful transitions,"" said Ms. Levin, who lives in Newton, Mass. Like many people who employ nannies, she said other transitions have been rough. Some were because her children were really attached to a caregiver, like the nannies who loved the Boston Red Sox as her son, 12, does. She imagines her daughter, 5, will miss this nanny because they have a special bond over arts and crafts.

But there have been other times when the nanny left in a rush -- or was rushed out -- and Ms. Levin had to explain to her children why someone who seemed to care so deeply for them was gone. This is the time of year when families and nannies typically part ways, as the summer nears an end and school is about to start. A lot gets written about the nuts and bolts of hiring and firing a nanny (including by me). But most of the focus is on issues that can be resolved if people remember the three P's: Pay nannies fairly, pay their taxes and pay attention. The more complex issues are how the departures are handled within the family. Younger children do not understand that the person who read to them, bathed them and snuggled them was being paid to do so. And, as a paid employee, a nanny is free to quit like anyone else. What makes the transition difficult, of course, is that nannies work in the home and come to know their employers' children as well as anyone. They are employees, but over the time the boundaries slip and they can seem more like a family member. ""I've sometimes been quite surprised interviewing employers about how much animus and negativity parents can bring to the situation of a nanny leaving,"" said Julia Wrigley, university provost at the City University of New York and the author of ""Other People's Children"" (Basic Books, 1995). ""It's the personalized nature of the relationship. They may have had the nanny for a long time and gotten comfortable.""

While the notion of finding a Mary Poppins who will be with children from birth to college is largely outdated, many parents cling to it. Most anyone with the means to hire a nanny and the desire to have the flexibility promised by one-on-one child care needs to realize that the nanny, however beloved, is going to leave at some point. Ms. Wrigley, in her research, found that children largely acclimated to new caregivers. The toughest transition was the first time a child realized a nanny was leaving because it disrupted the child's sense of permanence. ""I interviewed two sisters, and one of them, once her nanny left, she wondered if her sister would be the next to go,"" Ms. Wrigley said. ""She hadn't figured out the boundaries of the family."" Children who had many nannies grew jaded. ""The child came to expect it,"" she said. ""They stopped investing so much in the caregivers."" Still, most parents -- and caregivers, for that matter -- don't want to cause unnecessary distress to children. Nor do parents want the previous nanny's departure to complicate the job of the next nanny. It's a difficult balance to attain. A nanny is going to depart for three reasons: The children she was caring for are older and in school; she finds a better job; or she is fired. All three can be handled smoothly. Lindsay Heller, a clinical psychologist in Beverly Hills who is known as the Nanny Doctor, said that in the best cases the nanny's departure was known for weeks, if not months, and the children had time to ask questions and understand why she was leaving. Even better for the children is when the departing nanny stays for a few weeks to train the new one -- though she said that is rare.

In good departures, maybe the nanny and the children stay in touch. If not, the children at least understand that it's not their fault that the nanny is leaving. Most of all, parents need to take themselves out of what is usually a stressful situation and help their children through their feelings. ""You need to talk about what the nanny did for us,"" said Jennifer Kogan, who counsels parents and children around Washington. ""She made us feel comfortable and safe and helped us with dinner and put us to bed. Those are all things that we'll miss. But it's important for nanny to go and help other people."" Like employers and employees in any job, parents and nannies don't always handle a departure in the most mature way. But children will look to their parents for clues about how to react and, more deeply, how to treat people. This is where parents need to rise above their anger at a caregiver and remember that they, too, have probably changed jobs in their careers. ""Even if it wasn't a positive experience, there was still a connection with your child,"" said Ms. Levin, who is a co-founder of Care.com, a website that matches families and caregivers. ""It's one of those life lessons, like transitioning classrooms or teams that they're going to go through."" Ms. Heller said children could experience behavioral changes for up to six months after a caregiver's departure. If they are toilet-trained, they may regress. If they are calm, they may start having tantrums.

""When the bottom drops out, and someone is not there, that can be a very scary time,"" she said. ""They didn't choose this."" To handle it, parents need to offer emotional support and help their children talk about their feelings, she said. Ms. Kogan suggested that parents encourage their children to write to a departed nanny, even if the parents have no intention of mailing the notes. ""Drawing for kids taps into some other part of them that, without words, helps them process things,"" she said. Since most people who lose a nanny under bad circumstances must hire another one, how the previous nanny left will determine how the new one is received. In the short term, that will determine whether the children listen to the nanny and develop a bond that is essential for the person charged with not just educating a child but keeping that child safe. For the parents on nanny No. 2, 3 or 10, the problem of second-guessing their choice grows with each one. Dr. Heller said parents had to do their best to train a nanny and then trust their choice. ""If your child is reacting to the caregiver, it doesn't mean you've chosen the wrong nanny,"" she said. ""It means it's a difficult transition to a new person. There is going to be some pushback."" And while most nannies mesh with a family within three months, parents need to take the time to work with the nanny and the children, or they could find themselves in the same predicament again, sooner than they would like.","The departure of a nanny can be difficult for children, but there are things parents can do to make it less so.",95dd1e4d-e6c2-5ed0-b2ed-36d790aeae6a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/09/business/09wealth-pic1/09wealth-pic1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=414&w=600&s=1a77d124ea8dded055edacb62d05814fe32cfb76b022696971137b2f59a89ebc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"""Even if it wasn't a positive experience, there was still a connection with your child,"" said Donna Levin, a co-founder of Care.com, a website that matches families and caregivers.",95dd1e4d-e6c2-5ed0-b2ed-36d790aeae6a,N24News/imgs/95dd1e4d-e6c2-5ed0-b2ed-36d790aeae6a.jpg,21
Dance,Baryshnikov Arts Center to Commission New Online Works,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/arts/dance/baryshnikov-arts-center-to-commission-new-online-works.html,"Baryshnikov Arts Center announced on Thursday a new commissioning program that aims to encourage choreographers and other artists to continue creating while the performing arts remain largely shut down in New York City because of the pandemic. The inaugural group of commission recipients -- including the dance-makers Kyle Marshall and Bijayini Satpathy, and the media designer and performer Tei Blow -- will receive financial support, rehearsal space and assistance from the center's production team to film and edit their projects, which will be shared online.

""We need art right now more than ever -- otherwise, what will we have?"" said Mikhail Baryshnikov, the organization's founder and artistic director. Creating work that translates onscreen can be challenging, he added, though he expects that the chosen recipients will be motivated, not cowed, by the requirements.

""I think these limitations are wonderful for those artists who have maybe never prepared art projects for a digital space,"" he said. ""Choreographically, especially, you have to really figure out depth of field, where the camera goes.""

The artists' work will debut after the arts center's coming digital season, which is to begin on Oct. 1 with ""Coming Together,"" a musical film that features the Quodlibet Ensemble and Reginald Mobley, a countertenor, performing Frederic Rzewski's Minimalist response to the 1971 Attica Prison uprising.","The initiative aims to encourage dance makers, musicians and other artists to continue working.

Sports,"After a Suspension, Alex Cora Returns as the Red Sox Manager",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/sports/baseball/alex-cora-red-sox.html,"Even as the Boston Red Sox announced Alex Cora's departure for his role in the Houston Astros' cheating scandal that marred the 2017 season, the manager's former bosses spoke glowingly about him. In 2018, after all, Cora had guided the Red Sox to a World Series title. ""He was a tremendous manager for us on all levels, so we're going to miss him,"" Red Sox owner John Henry said in January. Sam Kennedy, the team's president, called Cora ""an extreme talent,"" and when asked about the possibility of a second chance, said: ""He's apologized to us for the embarrassment that this caused. He'll go through a process of rehabilitation, so we'll see what happens."" Ten months after Cora was ousted, and with a Major League Baseball-imposed 2020 suspension now complete, the Red Sox announced on Friday evening that Cora, 45, was back in his old job. ""This past year, I have had time to reflect and evaluate many things, and I recognize how fortunate I am to lead this team once again,"" Cora said in a statement issued by the team. ""Not being a part of the game of baseball, and the pain of bringing negative attention to my family and this organization was extremely difficult. I am sorry for the harm my past actions have caused and will work hard to make this organization and its fans proud.""

""Cora was involved in developing both the banging scheme and utilizing the replay review room to decode and transmit signs,"" Manfred wrote in January. ""Cora participated in both schemes, and through his active participation, implicitly condoned the players' conduct."" Soon afterward, the Red Sox and Cora ""mutually agreed to part ways."" While Red Sox officials then said that Cora had expressed remorse to them, Cora's team-issued statement didn't have an apology or admission of wrongdoing. Cora thanked the team's executives and called his two seasons with the Red Sox ""the best years of my life."" It wasn't until April, when M.L.B. announced its investigation into allegations of the Red Sox stealing signs during the 2018 season, that Cora first publicly apologized. He said then that he took ""full responsibility"" for his role in the Astros' scandal and called the team's collective conduct ""unacceptable."" Cora was not disciplined by M.L.B. relating to Boston's sign-stealing scandal, which Manfred called ""far more limited in scope and impact"" than Houston's. J.T. Watkins, the Red Sox video replay operator, was the only person formally disciplined as a result of that report. At the time, though, Manfred announced Cora's suspension for the 2020 season for his role with the Astros' sign stealing. During the 2019 season, the Red Sox fired Dave Dombrowski, their president of baseball operations who had hired Cora and helped build the team that won the 2018 title. Chaim Bloom replaced Dombrowski and promoted Cora's bench coach, Ron Roenicke, to manager for the 2020 season. The Red Sox, who are rebuilding under Bloom, were one of the worst teams in the major leagues this year, going 24-36 during the truncated season. Before the final game of the season, the Red Sox told Roenicke he would not return as manager in 2021, once again fueling speculation that Cora would return. ""Cora is an outstanding manager, and the right person to lead our club into 2021 and beyond,"" Bloom said in a statement on Friday.","Cora led Boston to a World Series title in 2018, but he was suspended as part of the Houston Astros' cheating scandal.",fd1501ca-455d-528b-a580-62786f735704,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/06/sports/06mlb-cora/06mlb-cora-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=737934e71017238a8dcddee43715f5d1815767e849ce2cbceb4c0ce41b499c73&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Alex Cora led the Boston Red Sox to a World Series title in 2018.

Fashion & Style,She Crumbled the Fortress Around His Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/fashion/weddings/sting-best-man-for-simon-astaire-and-pilar-ordovas-wedding.html,"When Sting married Trudie Styler 26 years ago, his close friend, Simon Astaire, served as the best man. Last month, in New York, Sting was finally able to return the favor. ""I've known him for 40 years; I never thought I'd be the best man, because I never thought he would marry,"" said Sting, a.k.a. Gordon Sumner, as he was standing in the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Mr. Astaire, 57, would have had to agree, until he met Pilar Ordovas. ""Pilar is different than anyone I've gone out with,"" he said. ""There's a connection I have never felt before. She will make me a better person, and I knew that as I started to fall in love with her."" Long before the couple met, Mr. Astaire, who was born in London, was far more successful in his professional life than his love life.

At the age of 19, he began working as an agent with International Creative Management, one of the world's largest talent and literary agencies. In 1993, he became a publicist, representing members of the British royal family, specifically Prince and Princess Michael of Kent, among other clients. In 2008, he turned his attention to writing, and for the next decade wrote seven novels including, ""The Last Photograph,"" which was adapted into a movie in 2017. Although he has a son, Milo, 25, with the model Saffron Aldridge, the pair never married, and Mr. Astaire had almost resigned himself to being single. ""I was sent away to school at a young age and learned to shut off any emotion,"" Mr. Astaire said. ""To show any sort of love or sensitivity was seen as a weakness. That has deeply marked my life and it followed me. I've had loving relationships, but they have been short term. It's taken me a long time to meet someone who was able to understand me and my resistance."" In March 2016, Mr. Astaire was at Kennedy Airport traveling home, from New York to London, when he spotted a chicly dressed woman in the line at British Airways. He saw her again in the airline's executive club. ""I thought, 'If there's a God, please seat her next to me,'"" he said. Ms. Ordovas, 46, who is from Madrid, had worked at the Christie's auction house as the international director and deputy chairman for more than a decade before becoming an art dealer with galleries in New York and London. Though she was married at the time, the relationship was dissolving.

""I couldn't believe I was sitting next to her,"" he said. ""In business class they have these swine seats that face each other. It's one of the worst designs. You sit down and you are literally facing a stranger. I wanted to make her feel comfortable, so I said, 'Don't worry, as soon as we take off I'll put up the screen.'"" The screen remained down and the two never stopped talking. During the six-hour flight they found out they knew the same people and bonded over their love of dogs: Ms. Ordovas had one, Mr. Astaire wanted one. They said their goodbyes upon exiting the plane, as Ms. Ordovas had a carry-on bag and Mr. Astaire checked his luggage. ""I didn't think I'd hear from him,"" she said. ""I never meet interesting people on planes. But I phoned my office in the car and told them I spoke to this really interesting man.""

Mr. Astaire called his son, an art lover, and told him he had met a woman named Pilar Ordovas, who was a ""kind, interesting, fascinating and beautiful woman,"" he said. A recognizable name in the art industry, his son thought he was kidding. ""Milo said, 'Do you know who that is? You're lying to me. I'd love to meet her.'"" The following day Mr. Astaire met Sting for lunch and told him all about Ms. Ordovas. Because she was married, he didn't consider courting her, but he wanted to follow up on the dog breeder she had suggested. They stopped by her gallery on Savile Row in London, but she wasn't there. Mr. Astaire left his phone number and email address. She responded soon after with the breeder's information. A few months later, he texted and asked if she would meet with his son. She said yes. And as weeks passed, Ms. Ordovas and Mr. Astaire would meet once more, casually, at her gallery. On New Year's Day 2017, Mr. Astaire was having a drink at the White Horse Tavern in Manhattan. Seated under a portrait of Dylan Thomas, he posted a quote from the famed poet on Instagram: ""I wrote, 'Life always offers you a second chance; it's called tomorrow,'"" he said, ""and wished everyone a happy New Year."" Ms. Ordovas, who was by then divorced, saw the post and was encouraged by co-workers to respond. She, too, was in New York and sent him a message. But by the time he saw it, he was at the airport heading to Los Angeles. He promised to connect when he retuned to London. The two had dinner in early March, a year after first meeting. ""She was as lovely as I remembered,"" Mr. Astaire said. ""It's like for all these years I'd been looking in the wrong place. I met someone that has the essence of understanding me.""

Ms. Ordovas was just as surprised by their connection. ""I hadn't dated for so long -- I was nervous but so comfortable with him,"" she said. ""He has a good way of asking questions and making you feel comfortable. It didn't occur to me that I would fall in love again."" Over the next few months, they saw each other three or four times a week until Mr. Astaire went to Los Angeles for work. The separation allowed them to see how much they missed each other. Over the summer, the couple took a seven-day road trip to Marfa, Tex., where Ms. Ordovas was eager to see the Judd Foundation. Mr. Astaire had wanted to see certain parts of America. So they rented a car in New York and made stops during their weeklong drive: to Washington to see Georgetown; Virginia to experience Amish country; and Memphis, to see the Lorraine Motel, where Martin Luther King was assassinated, and to Sun Studios, Elvis Presley's recording studio.

A month later found the couple, Sting and Trudie, and several family members, at City Hall. ""They've been waiting for each other for a very long time; she's exactly what he needs,"" Sting said. ""I like the civic nature of City Hall,"" Sting added. ""All kinds of people are here, the wealthy and not so wealthy. It has a depth of meaning. I love the atmosphere."" Mr. Astaire did, too. ""I love City Hall. New York was something I'd always dreamt about. I have enormous respect for this country,"" he said beaming, standing next to his new wife. ""I wanted America to be part of my life more than anywhere else."" Dressed in a pink and white Chanel tweed dress, wildflowers clutched in one hand, her husband's arm clutched in the other, she echoed his sentiments. ""New York is really special to us. We met here, he proposed here. We wanted our marriage to be about us, and continuing our lives together. We wanted our nearest and dearest here. We didn't want it to be about the party."" Then she added, ""It's a perfect day. It's even snowing outside.""","Everything changed for Simon Astaire when he met Pilar Ordovas on a flight to London. ""I've known him for 40 years,"" said the groom's friend, Sting.

Health,How Pandemics End,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/health/coronavirus-plague-pandemic-history.html,"To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. When will the Covid-19 pandemic end? And how? According to historians, pandemics typically have two types of endings: the medical, which occurs when the incidence and death rates plummet, and the social, when the epidemic of fear about the disease wanes. ""When people ask, 'When will this end?,' they are asking about the social ending,"" said Dr. Jeremy Greene, a historian of medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, an end can occur not because a disease has been vanquished but because people grow tired of panic mode and learn to live with a disease. Allan Brandt, a Harvard historian, said something similar was happening with Covid-19: ""As we have seen in the debate about opening the economy, many questions about the so-called end are determined not by medical and public health data but by sociopolitical processes."" Endings ""are very, very messy,"" said Dora Vargha, a historian at the University of Exeter. ""Looking back, we have a weak narrative. For whom does the epidemic end, and who gets to say?""

In the path of fear An epidemic of fear can occur even without an epidemic of illness. Dr. Susan Murray, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Dublin, saw that firsthand in 2014 when she was a fellow at a rural hospital in Ireland. In the preceding months, more than 11,000 people in West Africa had died from Ebola, a terrifying viral disease that was highly infectious and often fatal. The epidemic seemed to be waning, and no cases had occurred in Ireland, but the public fear was palpable. ""On the street and on the wards, people are anxious,"" Dr. Murray recalled recently in an article in The New England Journal of Medicine. ""Having the wrong color skin is enough to earn you the side-eye from your fellow passengers on the bus or train. Cough once, and you will find them shuffling away from you."" The Dublin hospital workers were warned to prepare for the worst. They were terrified, and worried that they lacked protective equipment. When a young man arrived in the emergency room from a country with Ebola patients, no one wanted to go near him; nurses hid, and doctors threatened to leave the hospital. Dr. Murray alone dared treat him, she wrote, but his cancer was so advanced that all she could offer was comfort care. A few days later, tests confirmed that the man did not have Ebola; he died an hour later. Three days afterward, the World Health Organization declared the Ebola epidemic over.

Bubonic plague has struck several times in the past 2,000 years, killing millions of people and altering the course of history. Each epidemic amplified the fear that came with the next outbreak. The disease is caused by a strain of bacteria, Yersinia pestis, that lives on fleas that live on rats. But bubonic plague, which became known as the Black Death, also can be passed from infected person to infected person through respiratory droplets, so it cannot be eradicated simply by killing rats. Historians describe three great waves of plague, said Mary Fissell, a historian at Johns Hopkins: the Plague of Justinian, in the sixth century; the medieval epidemic, in the 14th century; and a pandemic that struck in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The medieval pandemic began in 1331 in China. The illness, along with a civil war that was raging at the time, killed half the population of China. From there, the plague moved along trade routes to Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. In the years between 1347 and 1351, it killed at least a third of the European population. Half of the population of Siena, Italy, died. ""It is impossible for the human tongue to recount the awful truth,"" wrote the 14th-century chronicler Agnolo di Tura. ""Indeed, one who did not see such horribleness can be called blessed."" The infected, he wrote, ""swell beneath the armpits and in their groins, and fall over while talking."" The dead were buried in pits, in piles.

In Florence, wrote Giovanni Boccaccio, ""No more respect was accorded to dead people than would nowadays be accorded to dead goats."" Some hid in their homes. Others refused to accept the threat. Their way of coping, Boccaccio wrote, was to ""drink heavily, enjoy life to the full, go round singing and merrymaking, and gratify all of one's cravings when the opportunity emerged, and shrug the whole thing off as one enormous joke."" That pandemic ended, but the plague recurred. One of the worst outbreaks began in China in 1855 and spread worldwide, killing more than 12 million in India alone. Health authorities in Bombay burned whole neighborhoods trying to rid them of the plague. ""Nobody knew if it made a difference,"" the Yale historian Frank Snowden said.

It is not clear what made the bubonic plague die down. Some scholars have argued that cold weather killed the disease-carrying fleas, but that would not have interrupted the spread by the respiratory route, Dr. Snowden noted. Or perhaps it was a change in the rats. By the 19th century, the plague was being carried not by black rats but by brown rats, which are stronger and more vicious and more likely to live apart from humans.
* The Australian Open will require players to be fully vaccinated.
* A C.D.C. study finds stillbirths are higher in pregnant women with Covid. ""You certainly wouldn't want one for a pet,"" Dr. Snowden said. Another hypothesis is that the bacterium evolved to be less deadly. Or maybe actions by humans, such as the burning of villages, helped quell the epidemic. The plague never really went away. In the United States, infections are endemic among prairie dogs in the Southwest and can be transmitted to people. Dr. Snowden said that one of his friends became infected after a stay at a hotel in New Mexico. The previous occupant of his room had a dog, which had fleas that carried the microbe.

Among the diseases to have achieved a medical end is smallpox. But it is exceptional for several reasons: There is an effective vaccine, which gives lifelong protection; the virus, Variola major, has no animal host, so eliminating the disease in humans meant total elimination; and its symptoms are so unusual that infection is obvious, allowing for effective quarantines and contact tracing. But while it still raged, smallpox was horrific. Epidemic after epidemic swept the world, for at least 3,000 years. Individuals infected with the virus developed a fever, then a rash that turned into pus-filled spots, which became encrusted and fell off, leaving scars. The disease killed three out of 10 of its victims, often after immense suffering. In 1633, an epidemic among Native Americans ""disrupted all the native communities in the northeast and certainly facilitated English settlement in Massachusetts,"" said Harvard historian Dr. David S. Jones. William Bradford, leader of the Plymouth colony, wrote an account of the disease in Native Americans, saying the broken pustules would effectively glue a patient's skin to the mat he lay on, only to be torn off. Bradford wrote: ""When they turn them, a whole side will flay off at once as it were, and they will be all of a gore blood, most fearful to behold."" The last person to contract smallpox naturally was Ali Maow Maalin, a hospital cook in Somalia, in 1977. He recovered, only to die of malaria in 2013. The 1918 flu is held up today as the example of the ravages of a pandemic and the value of quarantines and social distancing. Before it ended, the flu killed 50 million to 100 million people worldwide. It preyed on young to middle-aged adults -- orphaning children, depriving families of breadwinners, killing troops in the midst of World War I.

Will that happen with Covid-19? One possibility, historians say, is that the coronavirus pandemic could end socially before it ends medically. People may grow so tired of the restrictions that they declare the pandemic over, even as the virus continues to smolder in the population and before a vaccine or effective treatment is found. ""I think there is this sort of social psychological issue of exhaustion and frustration,"" the Yale historian Naomi Rogers said. ""We may be in a moment when people are just saying: 'That's enough. I deserve to be able to return to my regular life.'"" It is happening already; in some states, governors have lifted restrictions, allowing hair salons, nail salons and gyms to reopen, in defiance of warnings by public health officials that such steps are premature. As the economic catastrophe wreaked by the lockdowns grows, more and more people may be ready to say ""enough."" ""There is this sort of conflict now,"" Dr. Rogers said. Public health officials have a medical end in sight, but some members of the public see a social end. ""Who gets to claim the end?"" Dr. Rogers said. ""If you push back against the notion of its ending, what are you pushing back against? What are you claiming when you say, 'No, it is not ending.'"" The challenge, Dr. Brandt said, is that there will be no sudden victory. Trying to define the end of the epidemic ""will be a long and difficult process.""","An infectious outbreak can conclude in more ways than one, historians say. But for whom does it end, and who gets to decide?",f3c5d1ae-c062-5a27-9e8c-e0109c5adc54,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/07/science/00VIRUS-HISTORY1/00VIRUS-HISTORY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=292aa2b84448163341eb667e7f30b2ca850e07bb62e069ae4909fc7bc4e9ca85&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Sicilian fresco from 1445.

Technology,Thawing a Frozen Apple TV App,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/06/technology/personaltech/frozen-apple-tv-app.html,"Q. I have one app on my fourth-generation Apple TV that freezes every once in a while, and the only way I can get out of it is to unplug the whole Apple TV box. Is there an easier way to get back to the home screen?

A. As with apps on Apple's Mac computers and iOS devices, you can force-quit a misbehaving tvOS program without having to unplug anything. The next time an app freezes, quickly press the TV button twice on the Apple TV remote. When you do, the Apple TV goes into the app-switching mode used by iOS devices, where you see a series of application preview windows on the screen.

If the misbehaving app is not already selected, use the touch pad on the Apple TV remote to swipe left or right until you land on the app you want to close. With the app's preview window selected, swipe up on the remote's touch pad to forcibly close the program.","If a tvOS app stops working on your Apple TV, you can force it to quit without having to reboot the set-top box.",28b9b54f-021a-5f6d-81de-20868583200a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/07/technology/personaltech/07techtipwebART/07techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e1803bb8d6212079fc11397620b6ccc0500e03c17e5bd425523d7e0609d7167f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"To force an app on the Apple TV to close, select its preview window and swipe up on the remote's touch pad.",28b9b54f-021a-5f6d-81de-20868583200a,N24News/imgs/28b9b54f-021a-5f6d-81de-20868583200a.jpg,20

Ryan Murphy has tackled everything from glee clubs to plastic surgery to freak shows to haunted hotels. But he's never done a procedural -- until now. ""9-1-1"" follows a group of emergency workers in Los Angeles. Played by a high-wattage cast that includes Connie Britton, Angela Bassett and Peter Krause -- portraying a dispatcher, a patrol officer and a firefighter respectively -- they grapple with crises both inside of work hours (a pet-snake accident) and outside of them (sex addiction). The soapy tension builds in waves, but especially right before commercial breaks.

GROWN-ISH 8 p.m. on Freeform. Yara Shahidi has long been an anchor on 'black-ish' as Zoey. Now she gets a chance to lead her own spinoff, which follows Zoey to Southern California University. (Ms. Shahidi herself will soon head to Harvard.) But while she left her home confident, she immediately runs into plenty of issues. ""What I appreciate from a creative point of view is just how flawed Zoey can be,"" Ms. Shahidi told The Times in a recent interview.

THE AMAZING RACE 8 p.m. on CBS. The 30th season of this reality show arrives on Wednesday. Eleven pairs will navigate a series of challenges around the world in an attempt to win $1 million; the competition includes the former N.B.A. player Shawn Marion and the competitive eater Joey Chestnut. THE X-FILES 8 p.m. on Fox. Gillian Anderson has announced that this season of ""The X-Files"" will be her last, which may mean that these are the final days of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. The 10-episode season will follow the pair's search for their long-lost son, William, and surely feature several monsters along the way. LAFF MOBB'S LAFF TRACKS 11 p.m. on TruTV. A good deal of stand-up sets involve comedians building visual scenes for the audience to imagine. ""Laff Mobb's Laff Tracks,"" a new series hosted by the D.J. and comedian Cipha Sounds, goes one step further, with re-enactments of the jokes as they are being told.

RENT (2005) on Netflix. With its condos and craft cocktail haunts, Alphabet City looks a little different than it did in the '90s, when Jonathan Larson captured the AIDS-torn, rundown neighborhood as a bohemian hotbed of song and activism.

Music,"Drake and DaBaby Join Lil Yachty's Shtick, and 8 More New Songs",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/arts/music/playlist-drake-lil-yachty-ava-max.html,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week's most notable new songs and videos.

Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.

We'll look back at Lil Yachty's rap career as a means to an end. His new single ""Oprah's Bank Account"" has a plinking charm, just like his breakthrough hits ""1 Night"" and ""Minnesota."" Beats like these -- soft shuffles with chirpy melodies -- suit him the most neatly. But what he does best atop them isn't anything specifically technical -- he's more character actor than rapper. Hence, this video, a nine-minute comedy sketch in which Yachty plays an Oprah-like talk show host giving Drake and DaBaby the third degree. That they're game for the elaborate shtick means they hear something in Yachty, and that they see something more than can be heard. JON CARAMANICA

Too often on Margo Price's first two albums, her ambition was undercut by her production, which was faithful and often polite. Finally, ""Twinkle Twinkle"" -- from her forthcoming third album, ""That's How Rumors Get Started,"" produced by Sturgill Simpson -- has a sound to complement the particular tang of her voice. Simpson assembled a band both ferocious and grimy: Matt Sweeney, Pino Palladino, James Gadson, Benmont Tench. They're uproarious support for Price, whose singing is looser and tarter than ever. CARAMANICA

Released on International Women's Day, ""Malquerida"" (""Unloved Woman"") is a campfire singalong by the Mexican songwriter Natalia Lafourcade. She strums a Venezuelan cuatro, a small guitar, and sings a waltz about the age-old mistreatment of poor, hardworking women: ""Without looking at my eyes they silenced my words."" Quietly, and then with resolve, the women and girls flanking her join in to sing, ""Ay, que dolor"": ""What sorrow."" JON PARELES

""Wander"" is the two-minute track that ends ""Cyan,"" the new album by the Seshen, a band from the San Francisco Bay Area. It's less a song than a bit of slow-motion vertigo: a whorl of overlapping, interlocking instruments and Lalin St. Juste's multilayered vocals, with a three-beat pulse and no clear boundaries between loops and improvisation. PARELES

Tones and I -- the Australian songwriter Toni Watson -- conquered the world last year with ""Dance Monkey,"" and she follows it up with a variation on its music and attitude: plinking piano chords and her annoyed-child voice carry her from petulance to righteous pugnacity. This time, instead of singing about a rapacious audience, she's confronting insecurities implanted by her family -- ones she hasn't entirely conquered. PARELES

There's a low-lying restlessness about Mara Rosenbloom's piano playing: Each moment, for her, seems best understood as something to escape from. But with her new trio, Flyways, featuring the vocalist and percussionist Anais Maviel and the bassist Rashaan Carter, Rosenbloom leaves loads of empty space; she's inviting you to relax inside her restlessness. The first thing -- and ultimately, one of the only things -- that you hear on ""Dream of a Common Language -- Irruption,"" from Flyways' debut album, is a repeated, five-note pattern in the left hand. Maviel and Carter soon join in, each taking things one note at a time. ""No one lives in this room/Without confronting the whiteness of the wall,"" Maviel sings, sounding cool but tender. Eventually, as the song continues, Rosenbloom starts to adorn that low pattern with chords in the right hand; eventually it disappears completely, as a cloud of electronics fills the air around her. The space feels finally welcoming as Maviel sings in long, slowly fading tones: ""The true nature: the drive to connect."" GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

If Sam Gendel is playing his instrument into its own grave on ""Saxofone Funeral,"" then he should be pleased with what he's found there. It's more of a tomb than a grave, adorned for the afterlife with electronic accouterments, curved mirrors and history folding back upon itself. This piece comes from ""Satin Doll,"" an album of electronically warped jazz standards (like the title track) and originals (like this one). Together with the bassist Gabe Noel and the electronic percussionist Philippe Melanson, Gendel builds a rubbery sound-space out of the influences of U.K. jungle, ambient music, underground hip-hop and American Minimalism.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, the schoolteacher  scrapped her lesson plan -- teaching her third graders the Sioux prayer about not judging another person until you have ""walked a mile in his moccasins"" -- for an experiential learning exercise. She split the children at her all-white school in Riceville, Iowa, into two groups based on their eye color: brown-eyed students in one, blue-eyed students and anyone else in the other. The members of both groups received treatment based on that one arbitrary quality, the pigmentation of their irises. Over the course of two days of instruction, she convinced the blue-eyed students that they were not as smart, worthy or human as their brown-eyed peers, who were rewarded for their supposed superiority, then reversed the situation. The exercise demonstrated for the students how easily prejudice could be learned, and hopefully unlearned. ""Racism is ignorance based on being miseducated. Racism is a result of being indoctrinated instead of educated,"" Ms. Elliott said by phone from her home in Iowa in early July. ""I don't sugarcoat racism.""

When teaching, or speaking to a reporter, she uses a strict tone. There is no tolerance for talk of colorblindness, no coddling of so-called white fragility. There is only understanding how it feels to be mistreated based on meaningless standards. Her uncompromising, one-size-fits-all approach to anti-racist education differs from that of many contemporary writers and thinkers, who emphasize the importance of hard conversations, visible allyship, box ticking and historical fluency. Perhaps it is because she has seen history repeat itself. ""I was born the year Adolf Hitler and Franklin Roosevelt came to power, in 1933. I remember what the Nazis did from 1933 until 1945. And I saw that same thing happening in this country where skin color is concerned,"" Ms. Elliott said, recalling the 1960s. Though Black thought leaders had spoken directly to white people about systemic racism for years, as a white woman herself, Ms. Elliott was able to make the pain of discrimination personal for them with the ""Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes"" exercise. It was not unusual to observe tears streaming from the eyes of blue-eyed participants, who had likely never experienced serious discrimination based on their appearance. That the exercise resonated with people led to a second career for Ms. Elliott. She held lectures and workshops all across the United States, including an appearance on ""The Oprah Winfrey Show"" in 1992, a conversation with Angela Davis in 2018 and a seat on ""Red Table Talk"" that same year.

Adriana Cardenas, 24, became aware of Ms. Elliott a few weeks ago when a video of the third-grade exercise was shared by someone in her Facebook feed. ""I remember thinking that it was a super-charming video where you see kids that are very clearly racist at the beginning of the video do a complete 180 by the end of the video, having learned a lesson after three days. I definitely think it's a good 'intro to racism' video, especially for its time,"" Ms. Cardenas, a software engineer in Austin, Texas, said. ""But it is really appalling that it's being shared in 2020."" ""You would think people would be sharing this going, 'Look how far we've come,' but it seems there's been barely any progress,"" she added. Ms. Elliott is familiar with the attention her videos have received online, and she is happy to see conversations about racism happening on social media.

""I think that social media, including my videos, can and must be one of the ways to effect change, in the area of racist behaviors, but it isn't enough,"" she said. ""Experiential learning is more effective than watching other people's experience, of course."" She is all for social media feeds being flooded with anti-racist resources and protest imagery. What she dislikes is the ease and speed with which videos showcasing brutality against Black people spread online. ""I think that the repeated showing of Black men being killed by the police is attempted intimidation of those men and their mothers,"" she said. ""It seems to be deliberately designed to show all men of color what can happen to them if they run afoul of the law.""(Though camera phones have been heralded by some as tools for exposing police brutality, the proliferation of footage has not affected the frequency of such violence.) Ms. Elliott's more than 50 years of educating people about discrimination and unconscious biases have come with challenges. Aside from the stressful work of frequently implanting oneself into the center of ignorance, she regrets the suffering that her family endured. ""I didn't know how this exercise would work. If I had known how it would work, I probably wouldn't have done it,"" Ms. Elliott said. ""If I had known that our four children would be spit on and their belongings would be destroyed, that they would be verbally and physically abused by their peers, by their teachers and some of the parents of their peers, because they had what that community labeled as an N-word-lover for a mother."" Ms. Elliott's children weren't the only family members to face the consequences. Her parents lost their restaurant business after widespread boycotts, her husband was isolated from his friend group, and Ms. Elliott was shunned by teachers in her school system.","Before anti-racist reading lists and Instagram allyship, white people were presented with the ""Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes"" exercise. Its 86-year-old creator can't believe she's still being asked about it.",fe56b8df-5061-5822-9941-76cf7b91daa0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/fashion/15JANE-ELLIOTT-1/15JANE-ELLIOTT-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bb17c5a06646c6ddfe4c70d8c27f6582ce670da8c61c998f2c178b4292d85d85&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jane Elliott,fe56b8df-5061-5822-9941-76cf7b91daa0,N24News/imgs/fe56b8df-5061-5822-9941-76cf7b91daa0.jpg,15
Fashion & Style,"In London, Empowerment and Emotion at the Fashion Awards",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/fashion/british-fashion-awards-stella-mccartney-jonathan-anderson.html,"LONDON -- Fashion has often been known to stick its head in the glitter-dusted sand. But as the great and the good of the international industry descended on the annual Fashion Awards in London on Monday evening (a glamorous event positioned as Britain's answer to the Met Gala), politics was the most popular accessory of the night. Hollywood may be avoiding hard subjects as its awards season kicked off, but as the style set's members made their way up the vast, floodlit red carpet at the Royal Albert Hall, shimmering with scattered crystals (the lead sponsor was Swarovski), slipped into velvet banquettes, sipped Champagne and picked at beef tenderloin, they seemed determined to strike not a pose but a stand.

Maria Grazia Chiuri, artistic director of Dior women's wear, clad in black velvet, took to the stage to receive the Swarovski Award for Positive Change and declared, ""This moment we are living in isn't actually about sex, it is more about power. Fashion has a duty to speak out for and support and empower women, to help them express themselves.""

""After 2017, and everything that has happened in the film industry, I'm excited for 2018,"" she announced, resplendent in a gold turban and kaleidoscopic sequin mini-shift by the British brand Halpern (later, the designer Michael Halpern was on stage to collect the prize for best British Emerging Talent in women's wear). ""I know all of us in fashion will work together to push out the bad energy; there is no place for that here anymore,"" Ms. Aboah said. And, in a 14-model tribute to Azzedine Alaia, the legendary designer who died last month in Paris at 82, Naomi Campbell said, ""I would never have become the woman I am today without him."" Ms. Campbell recalled how Mr. Alaia had not only ""fed, clothed and watered"" her in the early days of her career, but had also stepped in to defend her in a street attack outside his shop in 2012. ""Papa was a protector and a teacher, a seeker and defender,"" she said.

Yasmin Le Bon added, ""If we wore Azzedine, we could do anything."" And so it went, with an emphasis on female empowerment and achievement. Stella McCartney was given a Special Recognition Award for Innovation. The makeup artist Pat McGrath radiated delight (and nerves) as she accepted the Isabella Blow Award for Fashion Creator. And Donatella Versace, in a spectacular diamante-encrusted bustier gown with giant panniers, was named Fashion Icon, 20 years after she assumed control of her brother Gianni's fashion empire following his murder.

Still, men scooped many of the blockbuster prizes of the night. Jonathan Anderson was the only name to go home with two awards; Accessories Designer of the Year for his work at the Spanish house Loewe and British Designer of the Year in women's wear for his own line. Charles Jeffrey, in full makeup, wept as he accepted the British Emerging Talent in men's wear award from John Galliano, the man Mr. Jeffrey called his ""idol."" And Raf Simons won the Designer of the Year award for his work at Calvin Klein, five months after receiving the same accolade at the CFDA Fashion Awards in New York. He started his speech with two expletives and talked through tears. He wasn't the only emotional one. Even Anna Wintour's voice wavered as she presented the Outstanding Contribution to British Fashion Award to Christopher Bailey, the departing creative director of Burberry, speaking of ""a quiet bravery"" that Mr. Bailey had called upon to construct his empire. ""I am sad to see him take his bow, but happy that he will have the time to see his children take bows of their own,"" she said.","The big winners were Donatella Versace, Jonathan Anderson and Raf Simons, but the message was political.",8792d825-f396-5183-8702-035f8daa2523,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/05/style/05bfa-B/05bfa-B-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=0f2ac6e19a83e8273357be8695d74a514322867f167c115a5b02de41ba395f58&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Donatella Versace, left, accepting the Fashion Icon award, and Naomi Campbell.",8792d825-f396-5183-8702-035f8daa2523,N24News/imgs/8792d825-f396-5183-8702-035f8daa2523.jpg,19
Music,Savior or Charlatan? A Punk Maestro Jolts Classical Music,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/music/teodor-currentzis-shed-verdi-requiem.html,"The conductor Teodor Currentzis -- anarchist, goth, guru -- has burst out of the Russian provinces and scaled the classical heights.

PERM, Russia -- It was after midnight when the maestro -- wearing a black motorcycle jacket, skinny jeans and boots -- strode into a cavernous old factory in this industrial city 700 miles east of Moscow. He made his way through the crowd as something between an avant-garde happening and a classical-music rave unfolded. ""Come,"" the conductor, Teodor Currentzis, who will make his American debut in November leading Verdi's Requiem at the Shed in New York, told a reporter . ""I want to show you something amazing."" Soon the room exploded with propulsive percussion works by Iannis Xenakis. When the drums grew quiet, Mr. Currentzis -- who had conducted Mahler's sprawling Ninth Symphony the night before and had spent all day rehearsing Mozart's opera ""Idomeneo"" -- followed the crowd out into the moonlight to an even older part of the plant with creaky wooden floors, where a puzzling blend of modern dance; a stage buried in laundry; long Russian monologues; and a Dr. Seuss-like wind instrument stretched into the wee hours.

He began that journey out in Siberia, as music director of the Novosibirsk State Opera. Disenchanted with the music establishment, he formed his own orchestra and chorus there, which he called MusicAeterna and which became known for electrically charged performances. He forged such tight bonds with its players that many followed him here when he was appointed the artistic director of the Perm State Opera in 2011. He has an almost messianic side: A brash claim in a 2005 interview that ""I will save classical music"" ruffled some feathers. His emo earnestness -- ""You can cry alone in front of your turntable to this music. You can close your eyes and scream at the top of your lungs to this music,"" he wrote in liner notes for a Rameau recording -- rubs some people the wrong way. H is general flamboyance still arouses suspicions in some quarters that he might be a charlatan. But now, in spite of -- or because of -- his iconoclastic approach to music, he is in high demand everywhere, with a series of important debuts and a steady stream of painstakingly detailed studio recordings for Sony.

Mr. Currentzis was born in Athens in 1972; his father was a police officer, and his mother taught piano. In his house, he recalled, the piano was ""kind of part of the family."" But he fell in love with the sound of orchestras, and decided to start playing the violin -- not yet realizing that the sound he craved was the whole string section. ""This thick, beautiful sound,"" he said. ""I wanted to be a part of this sound."" By the time he was a teenager studying music, he knew he would conduct, but he and his brother still enjoyed listening to obscure, psychedelic 1960s music, too. Mr. Currentzis eventually went to St. Petersburg to study with Ilya Musin, a renowned pedagogue who taught Valery Gergiev and Semyon Bychkov. After what he described as his ""punk attitude"" caused difficulties there, he left for Moscow, where he conducted for a small opera company. That led to guest appearances in Novosibirsk , one of the major Russian houses, where he became music director in 2004. As he started in Siberia, he founded MusicAeterna, which began as a period instrument orchestra -- something still rare in Russia.

""He was so disenchanted early on with the whole official music scene, and the orchestral scene in particular -- he just didn't want to play that game at all,"" recalled the arts administrator Marc de Mauny, who met him at the conservatory in St. Petersburg and has worked with him for years. ""He said, 'I'm in this for the music, to make music with like-minded people and musicians who are not going to look at their watches during rehearsal, who really want to explore repertoire.'"" Artemy Savchenko, a violinist, first performed Tchaikovsky with Mr. Currentzis in Moscow 12 years ago and decided to join MusicAeterna. ""It made the biggest impression of my whole musical life,'' he said. ""I decided: If you do music, it should be this way. Otherwise, there is no point. Teodor always tried to find in the music something very, very deep that is connected with ritual and mystery.""

As MusicAeterna began to flourish, Mr. Currentzis began attracting attention. In 2009, he began a cinematic odyssey: H e landed the lead in ""DAU,"" Ilya Khrzhanovsky's insanely ambitious (or perhaps just insane), still not-quite-finished epic film that has been described as the ""Stalinist Truman Show."" Mr. Currentzis and a cast of hundreds were filmed on and off for three years living in character in a replica of Soviet Russia. ""I thought I was hard-core before that,"" he said of the experience. And he attracted the attention of Sony. Bogdan Roscic, the president of the label's classical division , remembered him as a well-kept secret in those days, but said that buzz was already building. Mr. Roscic was so impressed by some of Mr. Currentzis's early recordings, and the support of people like the adventurous impresario Gerard Mortier, who had hired Mr. Currentzis in Paris and Madrid, that he decided to sign him in 2011. ""Others who today pretend they invented him either told me I should stop bothering them with this guy or completely ignored us,"" Mr. Roscic said in an email. ""It's funny how that goes.""

""Music is not created for the concert hall,"" Mr. Currentzis said. ""It's a very intimate thing that you have to feel. If you listen to a symphony of Mahler in the concert hall, and then lie down in an open field and listen with your headphones, you have completely different feelings."" Mr. Roscic said that this approach was similar to that of the pianist Glenn Gould: ""He doesn't consider recordings souvenirs of live performances, but, rather, a separate art form altogether."" Mr. Currentzis spent hundreds of hours recording the three Mozart-Da Ponte operas for Sony. Sessions lasted from noon until after midnight here in Perm for up to two weeks straight -- a grueling schedule, and one that would be ruinously expensive with a traditional orchestra. But his players were willing. And when he was unsatisfied with the ""Don Giovanni,"" he persuaded the label to rerecord it. ""It's a 'whatever it takes' ethos,"" said Mr. Roscic. ""The latest post-session dinner I had with him was in his dacha at 4 a.m.""

Mr. Currentzis was brought here in 2011 during a brief attempt to make the city a destination for cutting-edge art. He said he would only take the post if Perm officials agreed to let him bring MusicAeterna with him, and help him expand the ensemble. To his surprise, they agreed. But it was not easy: Perm already had an opera orchestra, and no one warned them that a second group would be arriving. Its opera house had an illustrious history; during World War II the Kirov Opera and Ballet were evacuated there, and they left behind a robust ballet school with a tradition that continues to this day. But the company had to adapt to Mr. Currentzis's new visions. Memorable performances followed, but also difficulties. Local conservatives began to voice objections about both the art and the expense; Perm's cultural expansion plan soon ran afoul of the Kremlin , and was dismantled. Mr. Currentzis, whose work in the opera house was so good that he drew critics here from Moscow and St. Petersburg, was the last man standing . But as this spring's festival unspooled, there were signs that his days, too, were numbered here. And a few weeks after the Diaghilev Festival ended, the rumored news became official: Mr. Currentzis would step down from the Perm Opera in September, though he would continue to lead the Diaghilev Festival, with an eye toward bringing some of its programming to Paris in the coming years. MusicAeterna would move on with him. Now the test will be whether Mr. Currentzis can retain his outsider approach as he leaves Perm for a more cosmopolitan base in St. Petersburg. ""He found this place in Siberia, and then in Perm, where he had the freedom to develop,"" said Michael Haefliger, the intendant of the Lucerne Festival, where Mr. Currentzis is leading MusicAeterna in several Mozart operas this month.

He has already been trying new things. He recently became chief conductor of the SWR Symphony Orchestra, a German radio orchestra based in Stuttgart. He writes poetry and wants to spend more time composing. And he said that while he had demurred when approached about conducting Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle at the Bayreuth Festival -- he was booked -- he hoped to tackle the work at some point, if he could get a year to prepare. (""A Wagner sabbatical,"" he said.) Change was already in the air the night he conducted ""Idomeneo"" at the opera house in Perm in May. After the crowds left the theater, the house lights were turned off, candles were lit, and tables were set out with bottles of wine and vodka for a party with the orchestra. Musicians who had just performed played chamber music. Some recited poetry. After midnight, the sci-fi sounds of the ondes martenot wafted down from a balcony. Near the end of the party, Mr. Currentzis rose to make what sounded like a farewell toast. ""The musical world doesn't develop as it could,"" he said. ""We ask, for example, where are the soloists that were around in the '20s and '30s? The fantastic composers of the 19th century, where are they now? What's happened to mankind? The truth is they're all here. But the system is such that they cannot appear."" And he spoke passionately of the need to do things differently. ""This is what we do here in Perm: We open up a new space,"" he said. ""We open these gates, and that's a reason, maybe, people come here now -- not to visit the monuments or museums, but because they know there's a space where they can maybe discover themselves and what they're capable of. And we will do this every day, until the very last day that we are here."" Then more late-night music filled the darkened opera house.","The conductor Teodor Currentzis — anarchist, goth, guru — has burst out of the Russian provinces and scaled the classical heights.",e3520508-0a3b-54a1-98f2-8a58f333ac17,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/15new-conductor1-promo/15new-conductor1-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ae9ca5e7587e27bfbe2b7bda434844681ac9bc2954f991b7cfeba948781875f9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Teodor Currentzis has been described as an anarchist and a guru as he's swept from the periphery of the music world to its most prestigious stages.,e3520508-0a3b-54a1-98f2-8a58f333ac17,N24News/imgs/e3520508-0a3b-54a1-98f2-8a58f333ac17.jpg,12
Food,"Red, Ripe and Renegade: Berries That Break All the Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/17/dining/strawberries-harrys-berries-california.html,"OXNARD, Calif. -- It ought to be easy to find a single ripe strawberry to sample in a 20-acre field. But Rick Gean picked two bright-red specimens and looked dubious. ""This one should be O.K.,"" he said, sounding not quite convinced. Then again, his definition of ripe is more stringent than most. Mr. Gean and his wife, Molly, own Harry's Berries, a strawberry farm on the inland edge of this coastal city north of Los Angeles where they do nearly everything wrong, at least according to the gospel of modern commercial berry farming. The Geans grow Gaviota and Seascape strawberries, known for sweetness and flavor but not for productivity or the ability to survive shipping and days in a supermarket produce department. Until five years ago, the only place to find Harry's Berries was at Southern California farmers' markets -- and today, the markets still make up 70 percent of the farm's sales.

The berries are grown organically, despite initial skepticism from Mrs. Gean's father, who founded the farm and swore that the unconventional approach wouldn't work. And each section of the field is harvested only once every five days, to give the fruit enough time to reach its flavorful peak. Large-scale growers typically pick every three days. Ripeness is all: When the berries run out, they run out, because the Geans would rather send a customer home empty-handed than with a berry that doesn't meet their standards. That accounts for the lines that form an hour before the area's biggest market, in Santa Monica, opens for business. The farm, which this year celebrates its 50th anniversary and more than 30 years at the markets, has been a shrine for generations of berry lovers, both professional chefs and customers who ate their first berry as toddlers and now push strollers of their own. Bucking tradition has worked out well: Last year, the Geans sold 500,000 pounds of strawberries.

Nancy Silverton, the award-winning Los Angeles chef and author who owns the Mozza restaurant group with Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich, has been buying Harry's berries since she tasted her first one in 1989. Jeremy Fox, the executive chef at Rustic Canyon restaurant in Santa Monica and the author of ""On Vegetables,"" won't use anything else. Mr. Fox sometimes identifies the berry's provenance on the menu, for a dish like the strawberry Pavlova with yogurt and black pepper. Ms. Silverton, on the other hand, assumes that by now most of her customers know exactly where the berries come from. Their East Coast counterparts, from Philadelphia to Boston, jockey for an allotment from a far smaller shipped harvest. They have included the New York restaurants Wildair, Upland and Le Bernardin; a few retailers -- like Eataly, owned by Mr. Batali and Mr. Bastianich; the online grocer FreshDirect; and the Doughnut Plant, which features strawberry-forward doughnuts in the spring. Ms. Silverton and Mr. Fox rhapsodized about the fuller, sweeter berry taste, the juice-dribbling texture (compared with the chalky innards of some commercial berries) and an aroma that wafts toward marketgoers before they reach the stall. When they ran out of superlatives, they both settled on a single adjective: ""red,"" summing up all a strawberry should be. The farm didn't start out this way. In 1967, Mrs. Gean's father, Harry Iwamoto, a Japanese immigrant, leased 120 acres in Oxnard and planted what the Geans refer to as ""commodity"" berries, a hardy strain picked when they are still partly white inside, to extend their shelf life. They didn't taste like fully ripe berries, but that was beside the point. They made it to the grocery store intact. Mrs. Gean grew up on that farm, and married Mr. Gean, her high school sweetheart. In 1986, she was running a Harry's Berries roadside stand and he was driving a beer truck when they heard about a new farmers' market in nearby Ventura. They drove out to take a look.

Mrs. Gean, though similarly tempted, suggested they might want to try it first. They started at two markets, added three more, and applied for a stall at the biggest, oldest market in Southern California, the Wednesday market in Santa Monica. Then they waited. A year. Two. When they finally secured a slot, Mr. Gean announced again that he wanted to quit. ""I saw it as an upgrade,"" he said of swapping beer for berries. ""Nobody ever got in a car accident from eating too many strawberries."" This time, his wife agreed. At first, they sold the same commercial berries they had always grown. But in 1993, the farm lost its lease to a water conservation project, and the family stood at a fork in the road: They could find another large parcel to sustain their wholesale operation, or they could downsize and become farmers' market purveyors, period. They went small, in fairly drastic fashion -- leasing a 20-acre plot across the road from the original farm, planting new strains and abandoning the wholesale business. As their market business grew, they leased an adjacent 27 acres, and in 2008 bought a 10-acre parcel. The Geans now send trucks to 19 markets, seven days a week. They coax strawberries out of the ground year-round, thanks to the mild climate, which enables them to create a labor force as unusual as their produce. Many of the Geans' pickers have worked the farm full time for 20 years, freed from the need to follow seasonal crops. ""We stepped off the traditional success track at a fortuitous moment,"" Mrs. Gean said. ""The farmers' markets enabled us to become what we are, to make a profit.""

That was the retooled business model until T. J. Murphy, chief executive of the East Coast wholesaler Baldor Specialty Foods, found himself stranded on the West Coast because of a snowstorm back home. He decided to check out the Santa Monica farmers' market he'd heard so much about, tasted Harry's berries, and contacted the Geans to say, ""I have to have those berries."" They told him it wouldn't work -- berries as ripe as theirs would never survive shipping -- but Mr. Murphy persisted. ""I'll have my truck there,"" he recalled telling them. ""Just give my guy berries, and I'll pay for them no matter what."" All the Geans had to do was build a new cooler that chills the berries more quickly, and pack them in sturdy plastic clamshell containers.

The farm itself is as good as Disneyland as far as Mrs. Gean, 60, is concerned. Mr. Gean, 63, creates oversize junk-art sculptures that are scattered around the property, and they have installed a party room, outdoor dance floor, aboveground swimming pool, swing set, trampoline and playhouse. A framed set of old photographs hangs on the exterior wall of a small, one-story office -- of Mr. Iwamoto, who died in 1993, just as the new farm was taking shape, and his wife, Yayoi, who died in January. Mrs. Gean's next project is a Japanese tea garden to honor her parents, which she describes to her grandchildren as ""sort of a museum of your great-grandparents."" ""Someone will continue,"" she said, imagining Harry's Berries as a fourth-generation farm someday. ""Because it's not just a farm. It's a family tradition.""

Fashion & Style,Cooper Hewitt Museum: A Mommy-and-Me Hot Spot,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/13/fashion/cooper-hewitt-museum-mommy-and-me.html,"Ashley Carlson called out homework instructions across a large lawn to her first grader, who was leaving with a babysitter after having practiced cartwheels on the grass, and then turned her attention to her 3- and 4-year-old sons. The two boys, with matching white-blond hair and blue polo shirts, were clambering up a low stone wall and leaning on a painstakingly restored early-1900s ornate iron fence. Between the familiar parental refrains of ""Don't pull on that!"" and ""Oh, don't do that,"" Ms. Carlson touted the virtues of the lawn. ""We live a block away, and we come here all the time,"" she said early this fall. ""This is sort of like a backyard. A stylish backyard."" The 7,600-square-foot garden of the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum, on East 90th Street just off Fifth Avenue, reopened late last year, the final chapter in a top-to-bottom renovation of the museum.

A lawn that began as the private Manhattan garden of Andrew Carnegie and was later made available for neighbors who paid for a key has since become a hangout for local parents of young children and the people charged with taking care of them. There is no fee to enter, and it is open to the public, no museum visit required. A cafe sells lattes, sandwiches, gelato (popular with the child set) and wine (popular with the chasing-the-child set).

Ms. Carlson said that security guards have had to reprimand her boys just once, reminding them that ""they're not allowed to stand on the artwork."" On a recent day, the lawn was the bustling play space of nannies pushing strollers, a towheaded preteenager balancing on an orange spinning chair and a preschooler in a pinafore having lunch from a gourmet grocery bag. ""It still manages to be really tranquil even though there are quite a good number of kids running around,"" said Marguerite Rogers, who has made the garden a regular stop with her 4-year-old son, Jamie. An elevated pathway, with a brick wall overlooking the main yard and steps to a back entrance (now closed) to the mansion that houses the museum, is lined with colorful yarrow and coral bells, and is one of her son's favorite places to play, Ms. Rogers said. Parents said they are drawn not just to the flower-filled pathways, but also to the eclectic mix of Upper East Siders, international tourists and artist types who don't frequently visit an uptown neighborhood that to some can have an almost suburban feel. ""It's not like when you go to a Gymboree-type place where it's all mothers and babies,"" Ms. Rogers said. Recently, she said, she met and had an actual adult conversation about culture with a Juilliard-trained singer.

Toddlers and high design may seem like strange bedfellows, but there is nothing for children to break or destroy in the garden. ""My aim was really to be the friendliest place on Museum Mile,"" said Caroline Baumann, the museum's director, who hopes it will draw more people inside. ""The garden, for me, is the gateway drug for design."" For the parentarazzi who like to artfully document their children's every move (and even their naps), there is plenty of Insta-bait. The outdoor furniture includes spare tables and chairs (designed by Stefano Giovannoni and Jasper Morrison, and donated by Herman Miller), curvy black-and-white modular ""Copabananas"" benches in the grass, and Yves Behar ipe wood and aluminum benches on the walkways. The most popular photo backdrops seem to be the off-balance rotating orange and gray chairs, designed by Thomas Heatherwick. One woman deemed them ""much more comfortable than they look"" as she swayed front to back and kept an eye on a girl drawing in a notebook in the grass. Near the Fifth Avenue gate is a blue Ping-Pong table, a selection by Ms. Baumann, who played daily as a child and regularly challenges colleagues to matches. (Maintenance work has blocked parts of the lawn and displaced some furniture this month, but the museum expects to restore it within days.) As Ms. Baumann, wearing sunglasses with bamboo frames and a short-sleeve knit dress that matched the bright orange of the chairs, surveyed the garden, Lance Somerfeld and a couple of members of his NYC Dads group were wrapping up a long play date. His 1-year-old daughter had spent much of her time pushing around a toy stroller.

""It's just a beautifully landscaped area,"" said Mr. Somerfeld, who added that he has come with his wife as well, to enjoy adult time and a glass of wine. His group meets there regularly to ""chain a few blankets and just kind of relax."" With access to bathrooms with changing tables, they sometimes stay for hours. Ms. Baumann said she is trying to maintain the garden's quiet, sophisticated vibe. ""The museum is monitoring the crowds so that it always remains comfortable,"" Ms. Baumann said diplomatically, and some rules have been implemented. ""We can't have soccer games in here. We can't order in 14 boxes of pizza for your kid's third birthday."" The museum has built in some landscape features to try to impede small feet from stamping through growing plants. For example, a foot-high rope was installed around the backyard's ""rockery"" -- a legacy of the original 1901 design of the space. But it will come down soon, both because the thyme has grown in and the barrier did little to dissuade children, including Ms. Baumann's own son, Hugo, 19 months old.","In a city tight on outdoor spaces, the garden of the Cooper Hewitt has become an oasis for children and their minders.",0da94503-31d1-5057-a5b5-cace034711b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/fashion/13COOPERGARDEN2-WEB/13COOPERGARDEN2-WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=9ab6fbdea9368d42575986f93879b88775ab82ac335716cfa20d9832f6b1e754&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lindsay Cameron watches Elise, her daughter, in a Thomas Heatherwick ""Spun Chair"" in the Cooper Hewitt garden.",0da94503-31d1-5057-a5b5-cace034711b0,N24News/imgs/0da94503-31d1-5057-a5b5-cace034711b0.jpg,19
Global Business,South Koreans Resist Hypermarkets' Intrusion on Small Businesses,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/04/business/global/battling-the-retail-goliaths-in-south-korea.html,"BUPYEONG, South Korea -- When sales at his clothing shop began sliding several years ago, In Tae-yeon first attributed the drop to a bad economy. But he said he soon realized that the real culprit was something else: hypermarkets crowding into busy commercial districts, attracting shoppers with their easy-to-use parking lots, flashy signs and cutthroat discounts and, as Mr. In put it, ""sucking the life out of small-business men like me, like vampires."" The arrival of hypermarkets -- vast department stores that also contain supermarkets -- is relatively new in South Korea; a few began opening two decades ago. But they are unique in the country because most are owned by chaebol, the family-controlled conglomerates whose dominance in large and increasingly diverse swaths of the economy is prompting many in South Korea to refer to the country as the Republic of Chaebol. Rapidly expanding nationwide chains of hypermarkets, supermarkets and 24-hour-a-day convenience stores are the latest and perhaps most visible examples of the penchant among the chaebol for seemingly relentless growth. Total revenue at hypermarkets grew to 33.7 trillion won, or $30.3 billion, in 2010 from 23.7 trillion won in 2005, according to Statistics Korea, the national statistical agency. During the same period, sales at traditional markets, where individual dealers sell products as varied as manufactured goods, meat and farm produce, declined to 24 trillion won from 32.7 trillion won, according to the government's Agency for Traditional Market Administration. So when owners of small stores, like Mr. In, began pushing back, picketing hypermarkets and lobbying lawmakers, they started a South Korean version of the ""We are the 99 percent"" campaign -- a movement in support of what is called ""economic democratization.""

The chaebol are widely credited with leading South Korea's economic growth, exporting goods as diverse as computer chips, cellphones, cars and ships. The number of subsidiaries of the top 30 conglomerates jumped to 1,150 last year from 731 in 2007. The five biggest chaebol -- Samsung, Hyundai Motor, SK, LG and Lotte -- generated 653 trillion won in sales in 2010, the equivalent of 55.7 percent of South Korea's gross domestic product. But at home, the sprawling corporate empires are also seen as predators -- so much that protecting smaller businesses from them has become a prominent slogan for both the governing party and the opposition before the December presidential election, which is approaching amid growing discontent about a widening gap between rich and poor. The anti-chaebol rallying cry is a reference to the country's 1948 Constitution, which requires the state to ""prevent the domination of the market and the abuse of economic power and to democratize the economy through harmony among the economic agents."" For several years, store owners in the traditional shopping street where Mr. In keeps his shop have suffered declining sales because of competition with three hypermarkets and a department store, all within about two kilometers, or 1.2 miles, and all owned by Lotte. ""We only ask chaebol to let us live together with them,"" Mr. In, now the leader of a nationwide network of 5,000 independent shop owners, said in an interview at his shop in Bupyeong, a bustling town east of Seoul. ""Currently they are behaving like giant serpents gobbling up everything."" Other countries have found their mom-and-pop retailers squeezed out by hypermarkets, like Wal-Mart in the United States or Tesco in Britain, but to understand how the chaebol operate is to understand how the South Korean economy works.

Big companies often dictate a profit margin for subcontractors, no matter how innovative their work, and unilaterally impose a cut in the suppliers' prices, said Hong Jang-pyo, an economist at Pukyong National University. In July, the country's Fair Trade Commission said that the nation's six main hypermarket and department store chains had forced their domestic suppliers to sign and submit ""blank contracts"" so that the chains could determine their own share of profit ""as they pleased."" Meanwhile, the hypermarket and department store chain run by the Shinsegae chaebol has guaranteed unfairly high profit margins for a bakery and pizza supplier controlled by the chairman's family, the commission said Wednesday, imposing a financial penalty on the conglomerate.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. ""In South Korea, they say no matter what you do, the winner is already decided and he takes it all,"" Kim Byoung-kweon, an economist at the Corea Institute for New Society, said during a recent forum, referring to the chaebol. To ordinary South Koreans, never was the hunt by the chaebol for new sources of profit felt more acutely than when they saw the chaebol opening shops in their neighborhoods. First, hypermarkets sprouted, and there are 448 of them now. Then they branched out into ""super supermarkets,"" smaller than hypermarkets but bigger than traditional supermarkets. There are 1,116 of those now. Most are owned by local chaebol like Shinsegae and Lotte, or by Tesco, which took over the Home Plus hypermarket chain it had started as a joint venture with Samsung. Samsung and other chaebol opened chains of bakeries or coffee shops. CJ opened a restaurant chain that specializes in bibimbap, a popular rice and vegetable bowl. Some hypermarkets sell tteokbokki, a snack made of rice cake slathered with chili pepper. LG, an electronics conglomerate, sold a Korean blood sausage.

These are the foods some of the poorest South Koreans make a living selling. When one of the hypermarket chains, Lotte Mart, recently sold fried chicken at half the price of mom-and-pop sellers, it set off not only a stampede but also outrage at how such marketing would destroy smaller shops. Under public pressure, Lotte canceled the discount. ""The government repeatedly told us that if chaebol grow, so will employment, exports and our country's credit ratings, and the benefit will trickle down to us,"" said Hong Ji-gwang, 47, owner of a cosmetics shop who is leading a campaign to drive a Home Plus hypermarket out of the Hapjeong district in Seoul. ""That's a lie. Instead of innovation and going abroad for tough competition, they make easy money by taking rice bowls from smaller people."" At Parliament, rival political parties have submitted a number of ""economic democratization"" bills, calling for various restrictions aimed at checking the unruly behavior of the chaebol. Huh Chang-soo, chairman of the Federation of Korean Industries, which speaks for the chaebol, said in July that he could not ""understand what they meant by 'economic democratization.' "" When the chaebol came under pressure to ""share profit"" with their subcontractors last year, Lee Kun-hee, the chairman of Samsung, said he had never heard of the concept and did not know ""whether it's used in a socialist, capitalist or Communist country."" And while accusing politicians of populist ""election-year chaebol bashing,"" the conglomerates vowed to increase the number of new employees this year by 3.4 percent. They also distributed gift coupons that their employees could use in traditional markets. That is unlikely to placate small retailers like Mr. In. ""We reject a life of living on little crumbs the chaebol throw to us,"" he said.","A movement advocating ""economic democratization"" has taken hold as the country's family-owned conglomerates continue their relentless growth.",0fb3066f-bee5-5b41-aa42-e8192a2502d8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/04/business/Won2/Won2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=370&w=600&s=46c10a27b87b2d5dc8f6229acfab3e0e390456791718643cde26dc43f0b3aac8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Cho Hye-jin, center, a merchant at Mangwon Market in Seoul, wore a vest in protest of hypermarkets like Tesco's Homeplus.",0fb3066f-bee5-5b41-aa42-e8192a2502d8,N24News/imgs/0fb3066f-bee5-5b41-aa42-e8192a2502d8.jpg,24
Music,Kesha Again Blocked From Breaking Contracts With Dr. Luke,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/arts/music/kesha-dr-luke-appeal-ruling.html,"The pop singer and songwriter Kesha, who has for years battled in court to be freed from her recording contracts, cannot pursue a countersuit against her longtime producer Dr. Luke that would void their business relationship, a New York appeals court ruled on Tuesday.

Affirming a ruling delivered last year by a lower court, the First Department Court of Appeals said in its decision that the singer's proposed amendments to her earlier lawsuit, which claimed that Dr. Luke had raped her and been abusive throughout her career, were ""palpably insufficient and devoid of merit."" (Dr. Luke has denied Kesha's accusations and is suing the singer for defamation and breach of contract.)

The ruling was the latest legal defeat for Kesha (born Kesha Rose Sebert), who has argued that she was owed royalties by Dr. Luke's companies and that she could not perform under her contract because of the dissolution of her professional relationship with the producer.

""You can get a divorce from an abusive spouse,"" the singer's proposed countersuit said. ""You can dissolve a partnership if the relationship becomes irreconcilable. The same opportunity -- to be liberated from the physical, emotional, and financial bondage of a destructive relationship -- should be available to a recording artist.""",A New York appeals court upheld earlier rulings that the singer could not sue her former producer to get out of her recording agreements.,ddaedb68-0b75-5c70-95a2-bd3e232c8e85,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/30/arts/30kesha/30kesha-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=294784e1d6c22c1b999ad0b6c9fef32718570b1d055c9c4b1cbdade083e3befd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In a new legal defeat for Kesha, a New York appeals court ruled that she cannot pursue a countersuit against Dr. Luke that would void their business relationship.",ddaedb68-0b75-5c70-95a2-bd3e232c8e85,N24News/imgs/ddaedb68-0b75-5c70-95a2-bd3e232c8e85.jpg,12
Opinion,How the Far Right Became Europe's New Normal,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/04/opinion/far-right-europe-austria.html,"Twenty years ago, on Feb. 4, 2000, a shock wave reverberated from the heart of Europe: The far-right Freedom Party of Austria, founded in 1956 by National Socialist activists, entered government. Led by Jorg Haider, a provocateur who had made a name for himself rallying against the ""Uberfremdung"" (""over-foreignization"") of his country and notorious for praising the Waffen SS and Hitler's labor policies, the party's October 1999 election campaign achieved the best result for any far-right party in a European democracy since World War II, taking 27 percent of the vote. After months of negotiation with the conservative People's Party, the Freedom Party was asked to join a governing coalition. ""This is the first time an anti-European, xenophobic party with a very dubious relationship toward the Nazi past has come into the government of a member state,"" Germany's foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, proclaimed. It was certainly a shock. After the war, European electorates had grown comfortable choosing alternate governments of the center left and center right during the second half of the 20th century. Their leaders believed the Austrian experience to be an aberration and looked to make an example of the country. Members of the European Parliament declared en masse that the Freedom Party's admission into a coalition government ""legitimises the extreme right in Europe.""

But in 2017, when Mr. Haider's Freedom Party successor, Heinz-Christian Strache, scored a similar general election result and the party was once again invited into a ruling alliance, there was little attempt to ostracize the country. President Emmanuel Macron of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany moved quickly to welcome the new Austrian government, led by the 31-year-old conservative Sebastian Kurz, who sought success by adopting much of the Freedom Party's anti-migrant stance. The youngest leader in the expanded European Union's 28 nations, Mr. Kurz had called for Muslim-run kindergartens to be shut down and refugees relocated to outside Europe's borders. The Freedom Party was gifted the foreign, interior and defense departments, and Mr. Strache -- who denigrated Islam as ""fascistic"" and as a young man had been arrested at a torch-lit neo-Nazi procession in Germany -- took control of the office of vice chancellor. The coalition agreement was fittingly announced at Kahlenberg, the site of the Battle of Vienna, which resulted in the defeat of the Ottoman Empire in 1683. Crowds gathering in the Austrian capital to oppose the new government were a fraction of those who came out nearly two decades earlier, when protests were so severe that the new cabinet could only enter and exit the inauguration ceremony through hidden underground passageways. The story of Austria in the 21st century is, in part, the story of the wider European project. Once, the far right was anathema. Now it is routine. Born outside the mainstream, its parties now operate as a powerful political force, pushing public debate and often government policy across the continent. The far right's rise ultimately emerges from a crisis of the political center. Politicians tasked with stabilizing the Continent after the global financial crash of 2007-08 became adept at turning the political narrative away from their own culpability. Europe's leaders found themselves re-evaluating the benefits of historic migration into their countries -- forever initiating debates on ""national identity"" (Nicolas Sarkozy of France), rejecting the ""multiethnic"" makeup of nation-states (Silvio Berlusconi of Italy) and proclaiming multiculturalism dead (Angela Merkel of Germany and David Cameron of Britain).

The case of France is instructive. Mr. Sarkozy -- the single-term French president from 2007 who announced that his country did not want immigration ""inflicted"" on itself -- was the perfect foil for an insurgent Front National. In 2011, at the party's compound in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre, I spoke to Marine Le Pen, who had recently assumed the leadership from her father, the convicted racist Jean-Marie Le Pen. She told me that attempts by the president to steal the Front National's clothes would be unsuccessful in the long term. By presenting himself ""as a kind of double of the FN,"" Mr. Sarkozy had initially ""managed to harness the force of that river and divert it to his own advantage,"" Ms. Le Pen said. She laughed. ""But now the river has returned to its own bed."" So it proved. Ms. Le Pen's far-right party successfully displaced the traditional conservatives (and dwarfed the incumbent Socialists) to make the presidential runoff in 2017. Though ultimately defeated by Mr. Macron, she still attracted over 10 million votes. Her rebranded National Rally party now finds itself neck-and-neck with Mr. Macron's En Marche in the polls, cautiously optimistic of victory in 2022.

The taboo on the far right in government has been comprehensively broken: Mainstream parties appear happy to cooperate with those once considered ""toxic."" Nativist representatives have been invited into ruling coalitions in Denmark, Finland, Italy and the Netherlands to act as support partners for traditional conservatives unable to win parliamentary majorities. No longer derided or dismissed by their mainstream rivals, far-right parties now show themselves capable of winning nationwide elections. Last year France's National Rally, Italy's League and Britain's Brexit Party won the most votes in their countries' elections to the European Parliament. But far-right parties don't need to win elections to see their agenda carried out. After the financial crisis, the governments of Europe almost universally adopted bullish positions on immigration, binding the issue with concerns around security, crime and benefits spending. In an age of austerity, ""Natives First"" policies are widely seen as economic common sense, championed by everyone from Denmark's Social Democratic prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, to Italy's previous deputy prime minister and leader of the League, Matteo Salvini. Against a cultural backdrop of virulent hostility toward the continent's Muslim communities, campaigning on the ability to deny new arrivals essential privileges -- from housing and health care to child care and welfare -- can prove electorally beneficial. Mr. Haider died in a 2008 car accident in Carinthia, the province where he had been governor for nearly a decade. In 2019, Mr. Strache, embroiled in a corruption scandal, was forced to step down as Austrian vice chancellor and was subsequently expelled from the Freedom Party. Yet their messages -- politically anti-establishment, culturally anti-immigrant and anti-Islam -- remain popular, permeating through Europe. Now no country is immune from hearing, in the words of the historian Tony Judt, the far right's ""one long scream of resentment"" -- even those with brutal memories of a fascist past. Unthinkable only a decade ago, both the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany and Spain's Vox are gaining ground as their countries' third-largest parties, garnering millions of votes and scores of parliamentary seats.",It was a scandal when a far-right party entered government two decades ago. Now it's just routine.

Well,Colon and Rectal Cancers Rising in Young People,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/well/live/colon-and-rectal-cancers-rising-in-young-people.html,"Cancers of the colon and rectum have been declining in older adults in recent decades and have always been considered rare in young people. But scientists are reporting a sharp rise in colorectal cancers in adults as young as their 20s and 30s, an ominous trend. The vast majority of colorectal cancers are still found in older people, with nearly 90 percent of all cases diagnosed in people over 50. But a new study from the American Cancer Society that analyzed cancer incidence by birth year found that colorectal cancer rates, which had dropped steadily for people born between 1890 and 1950, have been increasing for every generation born since 1950. Experts aren't sure why. Rectal cancers are rising particularly sharply, far faster than cancers in other parts of the large intestine or colon. The American Cancer Society estimates about 13,500 new cases of colon and rectal cancers will be diagnosed in Americans under 50 this year, with more than 95,500 cases of colon cancer and nearly 40,000 cases of rectal cancer in all age groups. ""People born in 1990, like my son, have double the risk of colon cancer and quadruple the risk of rectal cancer"" compared to the risk someone born in 1950 faced at a comparable age, said Rebecca Siegel, an epidemiologist with the American Cancer Society and the lead author of the new report, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute on Tuesday. And though the absolute risk is still small in younger people, she said, ""They carry the risk forward with them as they age.""

It is the upward trend that is worrisome: The risk of colon cancer for individuals who were born in 1990 was five per million people in that birth group, up from three per million at the same stage of life for those born in 1950. And the risk of rectal cancer for those born in 1990 was four per million, up from 0.9 per million for those born in 1950. Dr. Thomas Weber, a professor of surgery at SUNY Downstate Medical Center who has served on the National Colorectal Cancer Roundtable and who was not involved in the new study, said the latest research confirms the problem is real and increasing. ""There is no mistaking these dramatic increases, especially for rectal cancers,"" he said, noting that the number of new colorectal cancers among people under 50 each year exceeds the total number of new cases of less common cancers like Hodgkin's lymphoma. Young people with colorectal cancer run the added risk of getting a diagnosis later in the course of their disease, when the cancer may be less treatable, because doctors typically don't consider the diagnosis at such a young age. Kirsten Freiborg, who is now 27, complained to doctors repeatedly about having blood in her stool when she was in college, but was told she had internal hemorrhoids. She was finally given a diagnosis of advanced colon cancer a month before her graduation, when she was 22.

""I still remember getting the phone call from the doctor who did the procedure, who was completely shocked, and said 'I would never have guessed that a 22-year-old would have had cancer,'"" said Ms. Freiborg, who was treated with surgery and chemotherapy and is now cancer-free. Most colorectal cancers are considered a disease of aging, so any increase in young adults, especially when rates of the disease are on the wane in older people, is both baffling and worrisome, experts say. Colorectal cancer rates have declined over all in recent years thanks to widespread use of screening tests like colonoscopies, which can detect precancerous polyps that can be removed before cancer develops. These screening tests have not been considered practical for a younger population, and while other less invasive screening tests exist, doctors are hoping improved methods that will be easier to administer will be developed. Experts also attribute lowering cancer rates to changes in risk factors, particularly lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and healthier diets. Diets that include more fruits, vegetables and fiber and less red and processed meat are linked to lower colorectal cancer risk. Obesity and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with colorectal cancer, as are heavy alcohol use and chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and Type 2 diabetes, all of which are on the rise. But experts are not entirely convinced these are the only reasons colorectal cancer is increasing among young people. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes mainly cancers of the cervix, anus or the back of the throat, and only a small number of cases of rectal cancer. ""The honest truth is nobody knows 100 percent why there is an increase,"" said Dr. Mohamed E. Salem, an assistant professor at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University. He said that he is older than about 60 percent of his patients -- and he is 42. ""It's hard to blame it on obesity alone. We suspect there is also something else going on."" Dr. Jason A. Zell, an associate professor of oncology at the University of California, Irvine, who did a study in 2014 that found increasing rates of colorectal cancer among adults ages 20 to 39 in California, said the big challenge is how to shape health policy. ""By now we know the rates are going up, it's been reported several times,"" Dr. Zell said. ""Now the question is, what do we do?""

It found that in adults ages 20 to 39, colon cancer rates have increased by 1 percent to 2.4 percent a year since the mid-1980s, while rates declined over all among those 55 and older. Rates among adults 40 to 54 increased by 0.5 percent to 1.3 percent a year since the mid-1990s. Rectal cancer incidence rates among adults in their 20s increased even more sharply, rising by 3.2 percent a year from 1974 to 2013. And while rectal cancer rates have declined over all among people 55 and older since 1974, rates in people 50 to 54 increased between 1989-90 and 2012-13. By 2012-13, nearly 30 percent of all rectal cancers were being diagnosed in people under age 55, compared with 15 percent of all rectal cancers being found in this age group in 1989-90, the study reported. Many patients are so young at the time of diagnosis that they have not been screened by colonoscopy, which is recommended beginning at age 50 for people who are at average risk. The risk is higher among African-Americans, and the American College of Gastroenterology recommends they start screening at 45. Those with colorectal cancer may experience warning signs, but the symptoms are typically vague, including general digestive complaints like diarrhea or constipation, cramping and abdominal pain. Tara Anderson, a 40-year-old mother of four from Bowie, Md., had chronic constipation for years before seeking help at a free-standing emergency room clinic in 2015 because she was in so much pain. There, a scan detected a tumor in her colon ""the size of a tennis ball,"" she said.

A gastroenterologist who examined her a year earlier merely told her to increase her intake of dietary fiber to ease her constipation, she said. Fortunately, she said, her disease had not spread. For Chris Roberts, who was 29 when he found out he had colon cancer, the first symptoms were weight loss and loss of appetite. ""I lost about 20 pounds and I wasn't really trying to lose weight, but I just didn't enjoy eating,"" said Mr. Roberts, now 30. He had just moved to New York City and did not have a regular doctor, but was fortunate enough to find a doctor who was determined to make a diagnosis quickly and ordered several blood tests and an ultrasound scan that found tumors that had already spread to Mr. Roberts's liver.

Opinion,The Dangers of Medicare for All,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/medicare-for-all-cost.html,"Medicare now spends over $740 billion for more than 60 million enrollees, but taxpaying workers per beneficiary -- will decline by half in 2030 from when Medicare began. Nearly four million Americans now reach age 65 every year. In 2050, the 65-and-over population is projected to have almost doubled from 2012. America's aging population means more heart disease, cancer, stroke and dementia -- diseases that depend most on specialists, complex technology and innovative drugs for diagnosis and treatment. The current trajectory of the system is unsustainable.

But there is another paradigm. The Trump administration has begun breaking down barriers to competition in the health care market by improving transparency essential to value-seeking patients. It has also reduced the government's harmful overregulation of health care and insurance: barring ""gag clauses"" that prohibit pharmacists from revealing that a prescription drug may cost less than the insurance co-payment if bought with cash; and executive orders that require hospitals and doctors to post prices for procedures under Medicare and that facilitate tools to show patients their out-of-pocket costs have been introduced.

These moves, intended to remove the cloak of mystery around health care prices, are long overdue. The Trump administration has also increased private plan choices under Medicare, through Medicare Advantage, over the past few years. Nationwide, 3,148 private insurance plans now participate in Medicare Advantage, an increase of 15 percent over 2019 and the largest number of plans in the history of the program.

The average Medicare beneficiary can choose from 28 plans offered by seven firms in 2020. The continual increase in choices of coverage under Medicare Advantage to 28 in 2020 from 19 in 2016 reversed the trend of reduced choices under the Obama administration, when 33 plans offered in 2010 declined to 18 in 2015.

And while these private plans provide extra benefits not covered by traditional Medicare, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, average premiums for Advantage plans dropped this year by 23 percent compared with 2018 -- down to the lowest monthly premiums since 2007 -- likely a result of competition among insurers, reversing the average premium costs seen from 2012 through 2015 under the Obama administration.

Voters must realize this. It is pure fantasy to believe that the access and quality Americans enjoy today would be maintained if private insurance -- used by more than 217 million Americans -- were abolished and everyone used Medicare for All.

Abolishing private insurance, whether by law or via the slower pathway via introducing a public option, will eliminate the health care access and quality that today's retirees enjoy. Instead, empowering older people to seek value with their money with more flexible coverage and larger, liberalized health savings accounts, stimulating competition among doctors and hospitals, and increasing the supply of medical care will generate what Americans most value and expect from health care -- access, choice and quality.",It is pure fantasy to believe that the access and quality Americans enjoy today would hold if private insurance were abolished.,96955278-e3f1-55ba-a3b0-c26208af9d42,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/09/opinion/09Atlas/09Atlas-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2c1bc252aaf75646e68f06a8380029ca6e21f99380ce95d416a0dd50cabdf3cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Medicare for All has been a topic of debate in places like this town hall even in New Jersey in 2019.,96955278-e3f1-55ba-a3b0-c26208af9d42,N24News/imgs/96955278-e3f1-55ba-a3b0-c26208af9d42.jpg,11
Health,Research Nonprofit Shutters TB Vaccine Effort and Lays Off Scientists,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/health/tuberculosis-vaccine-institute.html,"The future of a tuberculosis vaccine and research into other neglected diseases is in limbo after a Seattle institute abruptly laid off about one-third of its researchers, citing a financial crisis. The sudden staff cutbacks late last month at the Infectious Disease Research Institute have baffled many of the scientists -- who were also working on a vaccine for leprosy and research into tropical diseases. The layoffs on the day before Thanksgiving also put in jeopardy federal grants for the scientists' work. This fall, the National Institutes of Health awarded a contract of up to $45 million to the nonprofit and other collaborating institutions to study the body's immune response to tuberculosis over several years. Developing an effective vaccine against tuberculosis, the world's deadliest infectious disease, has been elusive for decades. The only existing vaccine is decades old and is not effective in preventing the most common form of tuberculosis infection, in the lungs. A new vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline has proved promising in early clinical trials, but public health experts said there was a need for a healthy pipeline of additional vaccines to fight the disease, which kills about 1.5 million a year.

The 26-year-old Seattle research institute has often struggled financially. It has scrambled to close a gap between research grants from federal and private sources and its overhead costs, and has operated at a loss for years. The founder, Steven G. Reed, stepped down earlier this year from his role as chief executive after years of turmoil in which executives and board members resigned over their dissatisfaction with his leadership. Dr. Reed has defended his work, and is now rushing to raise money to resuscitate the organization. In an interview, the institute's acting chief executive, Dr. Corey Casper, said he inherited the crisis when he took the job in February. He said he had tried for months to save the programs, and had kept senior scientists abreast of the nonprofit's status. Thirty-three of the institute's 108 employees, who are mainly researchers, were let go. ""These were not easy decisions, but they were decisions that had to be made for the continued existence of the organization,"" Dr. Casper said. Research into drugs and vaccines is notoriously risky, and biotechs often shut down when a clinical trial fails or investors do not materialize. But scientists and other experts in public health said the sudden end to the programs was unusual.

Dr. Mel Spigelman, president and chief executive of the nonprofit TB Alliance, described the landscape for tuberculosis research as ""precarious."" He said that organizations face an annual shortfall of about $1.5 billion to finance new drugs, tests and vaccines for the disease, a bacterial infection that mainly attacks the lungs and can lie dormant for years. ""New investments are urgently needed to build on the progress we've seen to date."" The potential success of the institute's TB vaccine is unknown. Early-stage clinical trials have begun, and others are planned in a number of countries. Dr. Emily Erbelding, the director of the division of the N.I.H. that oversees the Seattle institute's tuberculosis contract, said that her office had been in ""near daily"" communication to sort out how the research could continue, and that it would depend on what happens to the institute in the next few weeks. Several researchers are trying to relocate their work to new institutions. The scientists said they had not been told whether the institute, which owns the rights to the vaccines and other experimental products, would allow them to continue their work. ""We're a little bit in the dark right now as to how we are going to do this,"" said Tanya Parish, who oversaw the institute's research into new treatments for tuberculosis. Her research staff was laid off in November, and she said she has been told her own job will end later this month. ""It sets us back at least six months,"" she said. ""We have a lot of ongoing work that's been disrupted, and some work will have to be redone.""

Dr. Casper said that the institute was also speaking to research institutions to relocate the work, and was also looking to license technology like the vaccines to ensure the research could continue elsewhere. ""We've made it very, very transparent to all of our investigators in our departmental programs that we want to do everything we can to enable their work,"" he said. Since its founding in 1993, the research institute has positioned itself as a nonprofit that operates like a biotech company, with a mission to bring new products to market for neglected diseases like tuberculosis, leprosy and leishmaniasis, a parasitic disease found mainly in the tropics. Early in the institute's history, Dr. Reed and Rhea Coler, the head of the tuberculosis vaccine program, played a role in the development of the GlaxoSmithKline vaccine. The institute also focuses on developing adjuvants, which are used in some vaccines to stimulate the body's immune response. But like many nonprofits, it has struggled to stay afloat. With revenues of $23.6 million in 2017, it operated at a loss of about $4 million in 2017 and 2016, according to Internal Revenue Service filings. In 2018, its filings showed, it operated at a smaller loss -- about $47,000. Former executives and board members at the institute pinned much of the blame on Dr. Reed, whom they described as a passionate scientist but expressed concerns about his financial stewardship and potential conflicts of interest, including ties to for-profit companies to which the institute had licensed some of its technology. In the spring of 2018, the institute's chief financial officer, general counsel, board chairman and two of its other board members resigned. ""One of the concerns was that nobody really seemed to understand how the money was coming in and how it was being spent,"" said R. Douglas Bradley, the general counsel who stepped down. He said he did not see evidence that Dr. Reed misused funds. ""There was a moment where it was just clear that his behaviors were not going to change."" Dr. Reed said he never did anything improper and acknowledged that keeping the organization going had ""been a challenge for many years, but we've always met the challenges.""","A financially troubled Seattle research institute cut back programs, leaving researchers to find new homes for work on infectious diseases like tuberculosis and leprosy.",82ed079b-bf5a-5bfa-a3f7-70a6c93ae372,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/science/00VACCINE1/00VACCINE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=07c8cf9f2a7c57d4c961c97d2a5c3fc031a12cd73262f23374bb21f6fd02527f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Tanya Parish oversaw the Infectious Disease Research Institute's research into treatments for tuberculosis.

Books,A Woman Who Resisted the Japanese Military,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/books/review/the-indomitable-florence-finch-robert-j-mrazek.html,"Before the war, Engelhart gave Finch advice: If she played hard to get with the man she was dating, an American officer, he would want her even more. During the war, Engelhart continued to provide advice. And after the Japanese had conquered the Philippines, Finch, now a widow in her 20s, smuggled a note into the camp asking her former boss if he thought it would be acceptable for her to work for the Japanese occupiers. She was afraid that he would see her as a collaborator, but Engelhart told her to go ahead. He wanted her to survive.

She started working for the Philippine Liquid Fuel Distributing Union. Her job was to maintain ledgers and fill out ration coupons for fuel. Almost immediately, she began giving part of her earnings to an underground courier who delivered them to Engelhart. He used the cash to bribe a guard and to obtain ""scraps of meat and a few fish heads"" -- not much, but enough to keep him alive. Later, she aided the resistance by falsifying records, stealing from her Japanese bosses and diverting about 250 gallons of fuel a week from the Japanese. She also continued to send Engelhart money, allowing him to buy food for himself and others.

Malnutrition was the leading cause of death in the camp. But other dangers included shootings, beheadings and disease. The number of casualties was staggering. In May 1943, Mrazek reports, Engelhart and his friends held a memorial service in an area to the south of the camp. The place was called Bone Hill: Thousands of men were buried in hastily dug graves, 40 to a plot, marked by mounds of earth with bones sticking out. Engelhart and the other prisoners brought wildflowers and sang ""Rock of Ages."" Then they returned to the camp.

At some point, Engelhart was loaded onto a ship, a vessel that sank. He and other survivors were herded into a Subic Bay tennis court, and while he was there, he somehow managed to preserve the pages of his sodden notepad by drying them in the sun. When Japan surrendered in 1945, Engelhart was freed. He and his notepad had made it through shipwreck and more than three years of captivity -- thanks to Finch and the money smuggled into the camp. Mrazek's book is a treasure, an eminently readable tribute to the wartime heroism of one brave woman and the astonishing endurance of one determined man.","Robert J.

Real Estate,Flushing's Very Own Time Capsule,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/realestate/kissena-park-queens-living-in-flushing-has-its-very-own-time-capsule.html,"FOR most of its history Flushing was associated with greenery. Settled by the English in the mid-1600s, the area evolved into a center for botanical cultivation; one nursery, created by a colonist named Robert Prince, harbored so many rare and exotic species that it was spared by both sides in the Revolutionary War. In much of Flushing today, that arboreal past can be hard to imagine. A bustling mini-metropolis, it is home to one of the city's largest Chinatowns. It is only near the southeastern border, in the blocks closest to Kissena Park, that drifting back in time seems almost possible. Streets are quiet, houses are small and mostly detached, and the electricity that charges the atmosphere in downtown Flushing is -- mercifully for many residents -- nowhere to be found. This subsection, roughly south of 45th Avenue and west of Pidgeon Meadow Road and 162nd Street, shares the name (pronounced ""kiss-EE-na"") -- though many more recent residents do not recognize Kissena Park as distinct from Flushing as a whole. Its character represents a deliberate departure, hard-won by advocates like the local civic association, which in 2005 won the area new zoning protection. Further construction of attached buildings was prohibited, and restrictions were placed on the building of two-family houses. At its best, residents say, the result is a blend of convenience and serenity. Kashmira and Homi Cooper, who have lived in a four-bedroom colonial on Rose Avenue, across from the park, for 23 years, recalled a time when they used trips back to their native India to stock up on groceries that could not be found in Queens. Now, Ms. Cooper said, anything they need -- Indian, Chinese, American or otherwise -- is available within walking distance. And, she added, so is the park.

Airports and hospitals are nearby, she said, and for a comparably green setting, ""a lot of people living in fancy areas of Long Island pay a lot more, and they have to drive everywhere."" Ivy and Jack Tian, both Queens natives who are 31, bought their house in 2008 for many of the same reasons. Ms. Tian is from Long Island City, her husband from Elmhurst, and the Kissena Park area, she said, is quieter than either -- while being near enough to downtown Flushing to be fun. The couple, who paid about $670,000 for the three-bedroom house, have a young son and a German shepherd, both of whom enjoy visits to the park, Ms. Tian said. Beverly McDermott, a lifelong neighborhood resident who is president of the Kissena Park Civic Association, says zoning is critical to the area's appeal. ""There's a sharp distinction between where we have been able to hold our own with the down-zoning and where the developers have gotten hold of properties,"" she said. ""They've taken the old community and destroyed it and built their own community."" Ms. McDermott and her husband, Willard, live in a four-bedroom house that cost $23,500 in 1963. (They also own the house next door; she said they had been offered $2 million for the two.) She described her group's members, and like-minded neighbors, as defenders of the area's character.

""We know it's not going to hold forever,"" she said, ""but we're trying to keep it so that people know what Flushing was like."" The character Ms. McDermott describes may be one reason that demand in Kissena Park is so robust. Francisco J. Rovito, an agent at Keller Williams Realty, said he received about 15 times as many calls for a house he recently sold on Beech Avenue than for a comparable listing in Jackson Heights. His experience was echoed by other area brokers, who told of offers, quick deals, and transactions largely in cash. Roger Persaud, an agent at East Coast Realtors, said a house he was selling at 142-03 Rose Avenue, a two-family listed at $1.298 million, was priced near the upper end of the market. Even so, he added, ""since I put the sign up, which has been about a week and a half, I've gotten over 70 calls."" The section covers less than a square mile. There are small stores on 45th and 46th Avenues, and a busy stretch of Kissena Boulevard, near the western edge, has restaurants, a catering hall and an Asian grocery. According to census data, the area is home to about 14,000 people. Toward its heart, most blocks are filled with houses, mostly two-story, with yards and driveways. Many are frame houses dating to the first half of the 20th century; some are larger and newer, having replaced teardowns. Lots are larger and yards woodsier along Parsons Boulevard -- named for another nursery owner -- while many of the blocks facing the park have smaller brick dwellings.

Ms. McDermott of the civic association said a recent proliferation of houses of worship had been of concern to longtime residents, particularly as a fair amount of property had been bought up in the process. Development issues aside, however, the names of the churches and temples offer a hint of the ethnic mix. They include the Hindu Temple Society of North America, the Russian Orthodox Church of the Annunciation, St. Mary's Nativity Roman Catholic Church, the Korean Baptist Church of New York and the Iglesia Evangelica Presbiteriana de Flushing, to name a few. According to data from the Multiple Listing Service of Long Island, which covers Queens, one-family detached houses over the last year have sold in the range of $525,000 to $1.07 million, with a median sale price of $657,500. Two-family houses fell into a similar range, though the median for them was $760,000. The service showed 20 one-family houses and 31 two-family houses on the market last week in the 11355 ZIP code, which includes the area. H. L. Kuo, a salesperson at Re/Max Team, says smaller colonials fall toward the lower end of that range, though if they are brick they can sometimes sell for more. The most expensive houses, he added, are the ones closer to the park, or those on lots 60 or 80 feet wide. The latter have sometimes been bought by investors who subdivided them, a move that is still possible on some lots even under tighter zoning.

Less tangible concerns influence sale prices for some buyers in the Chinese community, area brokers said. These include cultural preferences for south-facing houses, like those across from the park, and an aversion to houses near the Flushing Cemetery, at the neighborhood's eastern end. In general, said Laura Copersino, a broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, prices are buoyed by steady demand. As an example, she cited an 80-year-old single-family house she is marketing near the park for $699,000. Interest, she said, has been steady despite the house's imperfections. ""It's very well maintained,"" she said, ""but it doesn't have a renovated kitchen or bathroom, and it's going for very close to the asking price. So it holds its value there.""

A handful of rentals in private homes are available on Craigslist; two-bedrooms rent for about $1,600 a month. Kissena Park is partly zoned for Public School 107, which is outside the neighborhood. But the only public primary option geographically within Kissena Park is P.S. 24, on Holly Avenue, which got an A on its city progress report. Of tested students there, 67.4 percent scored at or above grade level in English, 85.7 percent in math. Intermediate School 237 and the East-West School of International Studies are both at 46-21 Colden Street. The former got a B on its city report card, with 41.6 percent of students proficient in English and 74.6 percent in math. The latter, which serves Grades 6 through 12, also got a B for its middle school grades, with 67.1 percent proficient in English, 88.7 percent in math. At the East-West School of International Studies in 2011, SAT averages were 413 in reading, 458 in math and 405 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide. At Flushing International High School, on Barclay Avenue north of the neighborhood, the scores were 312 in reading, 416 in math and 315 in writing. The prime attractions are Kissena Park and Kissena Corridor Park, which together cover more than 300 acres. They have tennis courts, baseball and cricket fields, a velodrome and a large community garden. To the east is a city-owned golf course, and to the west is the Queens Botanical Garden. Downtown Flushing offers stimulation of a different kind, with hundreds of restaurants offering a wide variety of Asian regional cuisine. Flushing Meadows Corona Park, the National Tennis Center and Citi Field, home of the Mets, are all a short trip west. The nearest subway, the No. 7 at Flushing-Main Street, is outside the immediate area, and best reached via a Kissena Boulevard bus. The Long Island Rail Road also stops to the north, at Flushing and Murray Hill. Midtown is about an hour away. The Long Island Expressway is to the south; its junction with the Van Wyck is close by. Those affiliated with Queens College have an easy commute south, by foot. The Flushing Remonstrance, signed in 1657, was a statement of religious liberty signed by residents to protest Gov. Peter Stuyvesant's rules against sheltering Quakers. One resident, John Bowne, was for a while banished to Holland for having allowed Quaker meetings in his house. It still stands, as a museum, on the street that bears his name.","On blocks near Kissena Park streets are quiet, houses are small, and the electricity that charges the atmosphere in downtown Flushing is nowhere to be found.",a727758e-3e89-5eba-a8b4-e72b86d9d335,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/12/realestate/12LIVINGIN_SPAN/12LIVINGIN_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=360&w=600&s=0ede53c914fc0df5c057db179566c113671aa71efbf4664dffbc869750288774&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A wedding party assembled for a winter photo session in Kissena Park, a green space that along with its neighborhood namesake evokes Flushing's more tranquil past.",a727758e-3e89-5eba-a8b4-e72b86d9d335,N24News/imgs/a727758e-3e89-5eba-a8b4-e72b86d9d335.jpg,7
Sports,Gymnasts Worldwide Push Back on Their Sport's Culture of Abuse,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/sports/olympics/gymnastics-abuse-athlete-a.html,"A culture in gymnastics that has tolerated coaches belittling, manipulating and in some cases physically abusing young athletes is being challenged by Olympians and other gymnasts around the world after an uprising in the United States. Many current and former competitors, emboldened by their American peers, have broken their silence in recent weeks against treatment they say created mental scars on girls that lasted well into adulthood. One gymnast, who is just 8 years old, said a coach tied her wrists to a horizontal bar when she was 7 and ignored her as she cried out in pain. At a time when the Tokyo Olympics would be in session, had they not been postponed until 2021 by the coronavirus pandemic, gymnasts have been sharing horrific stories of coaches body-shaming them, stifling their emotions, using corporal punishment on them and forcing them to train with injuries, using the pursuit of medals as a way to rationalize shameful behavior.

Chloe Gilliland, 29, a former member of the Australian national team, recalled her coaches telling her that she was ""a bad child"" and ""a danger"" to her own body because she was too heavy. At 17, she thought of killing herself because, she said on Instagram, ""I felt like it was easier to end my own life than to give in to what they wanted me to be."" Catherine Lyons, 19, once a top junior competitor for Britain, said coaches would hit her and harass her about her weight, and when she was 7 or 8 she would cry so hard that coaches would shut her inside a cupboard until she composed herself. Later, she said, she learned she had post-traumatic stress disorder because of the treatment. She told ITV News: ""I wasn't worth anything. I wasn't a human. I was a commodity rather than a child."" Other gymnasts have simply said on social media, ""I am one of them."" The stories from gymnasts in all levels of the sport are part of a coordinated effort, similar to the #MeToo movement, calling for the sport's leaders to eradicate existing norms that in reality are not normal at all. ""I was told many times that gymnasts should be seen and not heard because the sport is all about being the good little gymnast,"" said Lisa Mason, a 2000 British Olympian who was among the gymnasts to speak out recently. Mason, 38, said her coaches threw shoes at her and scratched her when she did not perform perfectly. Once she was made to stay on the uneven bars until her hands were blistered and ripped, only for a coach to pin her hands down and pour rubbing alcohol into her raw wounds, she said Friday in an interview.

It was the first time she thought about the culture of fear in gymnastics, she said Sunday in a telephone interview, and she was overwhelmed because she always considered the mistreatment to be normal. She said her coaches often yelled and threatened her, saying the gym would lose funding if she didn't make the world team. She recalled them using her as an example to younger girls of what it takes to be a hard worker, bringing them to her so they could see her torn-up, bleeding hands. They would say, ""You need to push through like Olivia pushes through,"" she said. The pressure and stress broke Vivian after the 2008 Olympics, she said, and it took the positivity of gymnastics at Oregon State and the ""Ninja Warrior"" community to build her back up. Still, since ""Athlete A,"" Vivian has turned to a psychologist to work through her sadness and guilt over not speaking up sooner so she could have saved other gymnasts. ""It's going to take a bit of time for me to work through this,"" Vivian said. ""But I'm glad I told my story for the sake of the sport and maybe give other gymnasts the strength to stand up."" One person familiar with the abuse gymnasts like Vivian have described is Gerrit Beltman -- because he used to coach that way. In 2013, Beltman was the subject of a book that accused him of tyrannical behavior while coaching the Dutch national team. He has also coached elite teams in Canada, Belgium and Singapore.

But in late June, as part of an investigation by the Dutch newspaper Noordhollands Dagblad, Beltman apologized for his actions and said he was ""ashamed."" Ten current and former Dutch national team gymnasts came forward with accusations of abuse in that report. ""It was never my conscious intention to beat them, to yell at them, to hurt their feelings, to belittle them, to gag them or make constant derogatory remarks about their weight,"" Beltman said in Dutch. ""But it did happen. I went too far because I thought it was the only way to instill a winning mentality in them."" He said he copied techniques from colleagues and previous coaches who had delivered many champions. When coaching in Canada, he said in the newspaper report, he realized that his style needed to change. Now Beltman says a shift in the sport is ""a matter of bitter urgency,"" and his daughter Reina agrees. She was an alternate on the Dutch Olympic team for the 2016 Rio Games and coached by her father when she was young. She was among many Dutch gymnasts who posted on social media about past abuse, later explaining in an interview that she has struggled with low self-confidence as a result. When asked about her father's coaching, she declined to comment. Reina Beltman did say, however, that her father's decision to speak about his past means there is hope for the sport. ""The best thing that could happen right now is for coaches to be honest and apologize for what they've done, so the gymnasts and the sport can move on,"" she said. ""We just have to have this conversation and, of course, changes won't be made over one night, but it's a beautiful thing to take responsibility and try to make things better.""

The next step, said Mason, the British Olympian, is for the sport to create a way for athletes to report abuse to an independent organization without fear of retribution by their federation or coaches, who have the power to keep them off top teams, including a national or Olympic team. Many athletes who recently came forward told Mason they did not trust leaders in the sport to investigate coaches. It is no wonder they are skeptical: Some athletes and leaders still doubt that emotional abuse is real. Liubov Charkashyna, a former Belarusian rhythmic gymnast, is the president of the athletes' commission at the International Gymnastics Federation, the world's governing body for the sport. One of her jobs is to listen to athletes' concerns and fight for athletes' rights inside the federation. But in 2019, she said the number of women who said they were abused by Nassar was exaggerated because some women were just trying to get revenge on their former coaches or earn money. And less than two weeks ago, the former gymnast Svetlana Khorkina of Russia, a three-time Olympian and 20-time medal winner at the world championships whose voice is still powerful in the sport, told Sport Express that the recent wave of abuse allegations is silly. ""There are certain things in the profession that are necessary for success,"" she said in Russian to the sports newspaper, and asked why the gymnasts just didn't quit the sport, leave the coaches or file lawsuits. ""It's just self-promoting, ugh!"" Athletes hesitated out of fear and uncertainty because abuse was so normalized, Mason said. She said she was disappointed, but not surprised, to hear Khorkina's comments because ""when you tell a difficult truth there will always be people trying to discredit you."" Still, Mason expects even more gymnasts to call for changes in the sport. She said she had heard from many gymnasts training for the Tokyo Games who would not come forward until the Olympics were completed. They do not want to jeopardize their chances of being chosen for their team, she said.","On Instagram and other social networks, gymnasts have tagged posts with #GymnastAlliance to share their own experiences in the wake of a new documentary that highlights verbal and physical abuse by coaches.",ad85485d-da0e-59f7-ab9b-98d7ec4c6dae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/03/sports/03gymnastics1-print/03gymnastics1-print-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=15652d097a52e33412ea5702c434ed095402e72a3970c42352227ebded73215d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lisa Mason, a 2000 British Olympian, recently encouraged fellow gymnasts to speak out about verbal and physical abuse by coaches.

Media,Hedge Funds Duel in Bankruptcy Court Over McClatchy Newspapers,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/business/media/mcclatchy-bankruptcy-chatham-alden.html,"A battle of the hedge funds is brewing in the bankruptcy auction of the McClatchy Company, one of the nation's largest and most decorated newspaper chains, pitting Chatham Asset Management and Brigade Capital Management, both debt holders in the chain, against a newcomer to the proceedings, Alden Global Capital.

Chatham and Brigade seemed to have an advantage going into the planned court-supervised sale of McClatchy. In April, McClatchy said it had received an offer worth more than $300 million from the two firms, which had taken on much of McClatchy's debt in a Chapter 11 restructuring. The two hedge funds planned to use that debt as part of the bid, which would keep the chain, with 30 newsrooms across the country, intact.

Alden, a New York hedge fund that has become a force in the newspaper business, tried to disrupt the Chatham-Brigade proposal on Wednesday by filing an emergency motion in a U.S. Bankruptcy Court. Alden asked Judge Michael E. Wiles to stop any attempt to buy McClatchy through a credit bid, a transaction that would allow Chatham and Brigade to use the company debt they had assumed toward the purchase price.

Alden's maneuver suggested that it, too, had an interest in acquiring McClatchy, a 163-year-old chain that fell on hard times not long after its $4.5 billion purchase in 2006 of a much larger rival, Knight Ridder.",Alden Global Capital faced off against a pair of rivals trying to win the publisher of The Sacramento Bee and more than two dozen other papers.,4010f6fd-fc5a-5996-8de6-c23c50f89f85,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/business/09McClatchy-Alden01/merlin_174297000_b5aa3726-f824-454a-9799-1f117ffbb423-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=51abf3358b46f39f7f18ec29b6e4f1367d5500b2732cc20c3437736ae9ff3fd6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alden Global Capital, Chatham Asset Management and Brigade Capital Management have expressed an interest in acquiring the McClatchy Company, a large newspaper chain.",4010f6fd-fc5a-5996-8de6-c23c50f89f85,N24News/imgs/4010f6fd-fc5a-5996-8de6-c23c50f89f85.jpg,16
Science,Tracks Hint at a Crocodile Ancestor That Walked on 2 Legs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/science/crocodile-two-legs-tracks.html,"Not long after bulldozers began pushing aside dirt for a new waterfront housing complex on South Korea's southern coast last year, construction was halted and paleontologists were called in. South Korean law mandates that new construction sites in the region, already famous for the fossilized tracks of dinosaurs, ancient turtles, frogs and lizards, make accommodations for fossil discoveries -- and this was a big one. Underneath the topsoil, the bedrock yielded large, pristine footprints over 100 million years old. Kyung Soo Kim, a professor of paleontology at Chinju National University of Education in South Korea, took samples back to his laboratory. Initially, he thought the tracks were made by a pterosaur, one of the large winged reptiles that ruled the skies during the age of dinosaurs. But in November, he picked up his colleague, Martin G. Lockley, at the airport and they drove straight to Dr. Kim's lab. There, Dr. Lockley, a specialist in fossilized tracks at the University of Colorado Denver, quickly determined the tracks belonged to an undiscovered species, a large prehistoric ancestor of modern crocodiles that moved about on only two feet.

""I was very surprised, and I did not believe him at first,"" Dr. Kim said. ""But he was right. The tracks prove they were bipedal."" Today's semiaquatic crocodiles are decidedly quadrupedal -- low to the ground, durable, fearsome and fast. But strong evidence showed that this prehistoric creature got around on two feet. While the tracks for the back feet were clearly defined from heel to toe and are found in regular formation, no tracks for the front limbs were discovered. That suggests bipedalism, much like you and me. Dr. Lockley and Dr. Kim estimate that the type of ancient crocodylomorph that made the tracks were roughly nine feet long from snout to tail, with their heads likely raised a few feet up from the ground, able to see prey and predators from a distance. They lived and hunted alongside dinosaurs, and based on the low frequency of fossilized track evidence, they were not a dominant species of the era.

The report was published last week in the journal, Scientific Reports. Mark A. Norell, the chairman of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History in New York, was struck by the size of the animal that left the tracks, and agrees that it was likely bipedal.

""For that time period, in that part of the world and the size of the animal,"" said Dr. Norell, who did not participate in the study, ""it's definitely a new species."" The species itself has no name yet, as there are no fossilized bones to confirm its existence. But the researchers named the tracks Batrachopus grandis. Unlike today's crocodile tracks, which are made from animals with feet splayed more to the outside, the track way of this ancient biped is narrow and well defined. ""If you put down a chalk line, these things would pass the sobriety test,"" Dr. Lockley said. Some could argue that the reason there are no front footprints is that the animal may have been wading through a body of water. But Dr. Lockley countered that tracks left by a partially submerged animal would only have shown the front claws of their feet as they pushed themselves along, not the heels. These imprints clearly show the full foot, Dr. Kim said, and in some the cases the impressions of skin are seen, too. When first presented with the tracks, Dr. Lockley noticed they were the same shape as tracks made by another crocodylomorph, which was the size of a house cat, over 100 millions years before. But a quadruped made those tracks. ""All we've done is find exactly the same type of track 100 million years later with two differences,"" Dr. Lockley said. ""One, the tracks are huge. And try as we might, we can find no evidence for the front footprints. The tracks are proof that they were bipedal.""","Over 100 million years ago in what is now South Korea, evolution experimented with nine-foot-long bipedal reptiles.",372c305e-01d7-52e2-bbb0-8b5b44090a03,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/science/17TB-CROC2/17TB-CROC2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=914f0fc60e8dcd49e0bb5253fc713ea47a36ba6ec2fee2da1b3a31bafbb68ebe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The crocodylomorph species doesn't have a name yet, but the researchers named the tracks Batrachopus grandis.",372c305e-01d7-52e2-bbb0-8b5b44090a03,N24News/imgs/372c305e-01d7-52e2-bbb0-8b5b44090a03.jpg,2
Economy,Nashville's Star Rises as Midsize Cities Break Into Winners and Losers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/economy/nashville-birmingham-amazon.html,"Nashville, right, and Birmingham, Ala., left, were peers 40 years ago. The success of superstar cities like New York and San Francisco and substars like Nashville has come at the expense of Birmingham and other smaller cities.





NASHVILLE -- Forty years ago, Nashville and Birmingham, Ala., were peers. Two hundred miles apart, the cities anchored metropolitan areas of just under one million people each and had a similar number of jobs paying similar wages. Not anymore. The population of the Nashville area has roughly doubled, and young people have flocked there, drawn by high-paying jobs as much as its hip ""Music City"" reputation. Last month, the city won an important consolation prize in the competition for Amazon's second headquarters: an operations center that will eventually employ 5,000 people at salaries averaging $150,000 a year. Birmingham, by comparison, has steadily lost population, and while its suburbs have expanded, their growth has lagged the Nashville area's. Once-narrow gaps in education and income have widened, and important employers like SouthTrust and Saks have moved their headquarters. Birmingham tried to lure Amazon, too, but all it is getting from the online retail giant is a warehouse and a distribution center where many jobs will pay about $15 an hour. Amazon's announcement has been widely described as a rich-get-richer victory of coastal ""superstar cities"" like New York and Washington, regions where the company plans to employ a total of at least 50,000 workers. But the company's decisions also reflect another trend: growing inequality among midsize cities.

Last week, for example, Apple said it would invest $1 billion in Austin, Tex., and could eventually employ 15,000 people in the area, up from 6,000 now. Like Nashville, Austin is a booming state capital with a prominent university and it has a lively music scene. Nashville started with advantages. But local leaders also made some smart decisions like merging the city and county government in the 1960s, allowing Nashville and its suburbs to work together rather than at cross-purposes. And in the 1990s, when many downtowns across the county were struggling, the city built a convention center, a hockey arena and a new home for the Country Music Hall of Fame. By contrast, economic misfortune and poor choices have hobbled Birmingham. Once a center of steel production, the city suffered when that industry declined in the 1980s because of foreign competition and corporate bankruptcies. Local leaders tried to pivot by luring banks and insurers, but that bet soured during the financial crisis, and the city hasn't recovered the jobs it lost then.

Ask Ralph Schulz, president of Nashville's Chamber of Commerce, why this city has done so well and he begins with the Civil War. Nashville surrendered early, allowing it to avoid the destruction that befell many Southern cities. Union troops used the city as a logistics hub, which laid the groundwork for its postwar economy. Nashville stood apart in other ways, too. The city was less dependent on manufacturing, in part because being Tennessee's capital brought lucrative -- and relatively recession-proof -- public investments. Its colleges and universities, anchored by Vanderbilt University, earned it a reputation as the ""Athens of the South."" The music business, which grew out of a 19th-century publishing industry, gave the city an international reputation, while the growth of Hospital Corporation of America in the 20th century turned the city into a health care hub. As a result, Nashville had a diversified economy and an educated work force that left it well positioned for the 21st century. But success wasn't inevitable. As recently as the 1990s, the city was portrayed as a backwater on the variety show ""Hee Haw."" Ronald L. Samuels, a local banker and civic leader, recalled being asked about Graceland -- which is in Memphis -- when visiting New York with the Chamber of Commerce in the 1980s.

""We had to answer the 'Where's Nashville?' question many times,"" Mr. Samuels said. Beginning in the early 1990s, though, political, business and nonprofit leaders tried to promote Nashville. State and local leaders adopted a regional approach to economic development to recruit companies such as Bridgestone, Nissan and UBS. Tennessee overhauled its community college system and work force development efforts to align better with the jobs being created. Starting under Mayor Phil Bredesen, who later became Tennessee's governor, the city invested in big projects that helped revive downtown, a key part of the city's success. Economists disagree about what policies are most effective at helping cities grow -- or if policies matter much. Some, such as Michael Porter of Harvard and Richard Florida of the University of Toronto, have emphasized the importance of cultivating a ""creative class"" of artists, designers and entrepreneurs. Others, such as Jan Rivkin of Harvard, stress the importance of civic leadership. Pretty much everyone agrees that having an elite university is a big advantage.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Whatever the exact ingredients, Nashville hit on a winning recipe. The urban renewal that began under Mr. Bredesen turned into a boom after the Great Recession, which, thanks to Nashville's diverse mix of industries, was comparatively mild here. The Gulch, a former rail yard and industrial district, was transformed into a vibrant neighborhood full of hip bars, luxury condominiums and boutique hotels. Tourism took off, thanks in part to the ABC television country-music drama ""Nashville."" Some of those tourists stuck around: The number of college graduates younger than 35 nearly doubled over a decade, to 155,000 by 2017. Employers soon followed. Among them are Eventbrite, a San Francisco tech company, and EY, the accounting firm, which last month announced plans to open an office downtown for 600 workers. AllianceBernstein, an investment company, decided in May to move its headquarters to Nashville, from New York, in part because of the big-city-worthy cultural amenities and the small-city cost of living.

In recent decades, the most successful cities have achieved a kind of economic gravity drawing the best jobs and most talented workers. That's why few economists were surprised when Amazon chose New York and the Washington area for its big expansion. But the effect isn't limited to a few urban giants. Mark Muro, who researches cities for the Brookings Institution, likened it to a fractal pattern: Look past the top cities and there is another layer of inequality. ""Nashville is not a superstar, but it's at the top end of this next echelon,"" Mr. Muro said. The success of the superstars and the substars like Nashville has come at the expense of Birmingham and other smaller cities. Birmingham's great boom arrived a century before Nashville's, when the region's iron and mineral deposits helped it become one of the nation's largest steel producers. But as the steel industry declined across the country, Birmingham struggled to find a replacement. A bet on finance and insurance -- the city was at one point a significant regional banking center, home to Regions Financial, SouthTrust and AmSouth Bancorp -- proved disastrous in the Great Recession, when the area lost nearly 45,000 jobs. The city still has millions of square feet of vacant office space. But Birmingham also has some significant assets. It has a research university, the University of Alabama at Birmingham, with a top-flight medical school and hospital. Research conducted at the university has helped fuel a budding start-up scene, and an affiliated incubator in a former Sears store, Innovation Depot, is home to more than 100 new companies.

Last year, the city elected a young mayor, Randall Woodfin, who has put economic development at the center of his agenda. He has created a Neighborhood Revitalization Fund to fix up homes and demolish dilapidated structures, and wants to use business tax incentives to help lift wages, not just create jobs. ""As a midsize city, we have to be very intentional about diversifying our economy,"" Mr. Woodfin said. ""I'm not waiting on Amazon or some other company to come in and save Birmingham."" The question for city leaders is whether they can overcome the economic forces driving inequality among cities.

""It's less than a zero-sum game -- it's a negative-sum game,"" said David Sher, a local business owner who runs a blog on economic issues. Mr. Sher would like Birmingham to follow Nashville in merging the city and county governments. He noted that Louisville, Ky., saw substantial growth after it did that in 2003. But even as some look to Nashville as an example, they want to avoid repeating its mistakes. Nashville's boom has brought congestion and soaring housing costs, making the city unaffordable for many longtime residents, particularly African-Americans. In May, Nashville voters defeated a ballot question that would have expanded the transit system, which many attributed to a backlash against gentrification and breakneck growth. ""What is the policy, other than growth?"" asked Paulette Coleman, a local affordable-housing activist. ""If economic growth is only benefiting a small percentage, you just keep getting these widening disparities."" Those concerns raise questions about Nashville's future. The city has thrived in part by being an affordable alternative to New York and Atlanta. It may soon have to compete with them directly by trying to become a superstar in its own right. In Birmingham, Mayor Woodfin said the city must follow a different path. ""I am 100 percent convinced we do not have to be the next Nashville or the next Austin or the next Charlotte,"" he said. ""We can be the best Birmingham.""","Nashville and others are thriving thanks to a mix of luck, astute political choices and well-timed investments, while cities like Birmingham, Ala., fall behind.",6614d32c-2e21-59a1-bb59-be5ef5b9644c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/17/business/17nashville-diptych/17nashville-diptych-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e8fc2f707f46a75c1b10a46f21877f73b39be81e3ae8491fad5317ea65d31517&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nashville, right, and Birmingham, Ala., left, were peers 40 years ago.

Claim to Fame: Ms. Sanchez first made a name for herself on Instagram, where she showcased fashion images from the '90s and early 2000s alongside selfies and mirror pics where her own style is on display. Her personal aesthetic is influenced by sportswear and sneaker culture, and it piqued the interest of Oliver El Khatib, the co-founder of October's Very Own and executive producer for Drake, the rapper. He connected Ms. Sanchez with Drake, and the two ""clicked,"" she said; she's been his image director since August.

Big Break: In 2013, while Ms. Sanchez was still a junior at New York University studying visual communication, she approached Ronnie Fieg, the owner of Kith, to become the creative director for the label, which at that time only had five employees (it now has about 180 ). Ms. Sanchez had known Mr. Fieg previously -- as a teenager, she was a sneaker saleswoman at David Z, which is owned by his uncle.

Movies,'Desert One' Review: The Iranian Hostage Rescue That Wasn't,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/movies/desert-one-review.html,"In her latest film, Barbara Kopple, an Academy Award-winning documentarian known for keenly observed verite portraits of workers' struggles (""Harlan County, U.S.A.,"" ""American Dream"") and celebrity lives (""Shut Up & Sing""), takes a frustratingly conventional approach to a well-known slice of history.

Produced for the History Channel, ""Desert One"" details the doomed 1980 Delta Force operation to rescue the 52 Americans held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran. Soon after landing in the desert, the mission hit technical snags and weather problems, culminating not only in failure but also tragedy: Eight servicemen died in an accidental crash. The incident, many believe, cost President Jimmy Carter a second term.

Kopple aims for a 360-degree sweep of the story, interviewing servicemen involved, the hostages, their Iranian captors, as well as Carter and several high-profile members of his administration.

Travel,What to Pack for a Trip to Copenhagen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/travel/what-to-pack-for-a-trip-to-copenhagen.html,"Copenhagen is a combination of Old World Europe and 21st century modern sensibilities. Both extend deep, beyond the art and architecture to the life and feel of the city. We have tips to help you explore Copenhagen in our local guide. But before you go, pack these essentials to make the most of your trip.

We've shared packing tips for any 36-hour trip in previous lists, so we talked to Ria Misra, an editor at Wirecutter, about some of the things you might want specifically for a trip to Copenhagen. Here are her picks.
* None Cycling gear. Copenhagen is very bike-friendly, and if you plan to tour Harbor Circle by bike, you may want to bring your own helmet in case your rental place doesn't offer them. Ms. Misra suggests the sleek Giro Savant, which will take up relatively little space in your luggage. She also suggests Smartwool's Merino 150 base layers (available in both men's and women's sizes) to wick away sweat and protect you from the sun.
* None Protection from the rain. Curling up in a cozy sweater at one of the city's many coffee shops sounds snug -- but if that sweater is sopping wet from your bike ride or walk over, that vision of hygge melts quickly. Ms. Misra suggests a packable rain jacket, such as Patagonia's Torrentshell Jacket, that will layer easily over your clothes. When you're off the bike, the small yet durable AmazonBasics Automatic Travel umbrella will keep both you and your belongings dry.
* None Super stylish carryall. The Fjallraven Kanken Backpack is made of water-resistant fabric (helpful if you do get caught in the rain), it's sturdy enough to withstand plenty of wear and its simple but streamlined design will blend in neatly in the city streets. Plus, you'll get more life out of it on future trips.
* None Sauna survival kit. In our local guide, we recommend a lovely afternoon on the water and in the sauna, but since La Banchina is a cafe, after all, and not a full-service spa, bring everything you need to tidy up afterward. An absorbent, microfiber towel that dries quickly, like the Packtowl Personal, which stuffs down into its carrying pouch, is great both in and after the sauna. Stash a comfortable pair of flip-flops (Ms. Misra points to Wirecutter favorites, the grippy Havaianas Top Flip-Flop) to protect your feet, and don't forget an extra tiny dopp kit like this Eagle Creek Pack-It Specter Quick Trip packed with cleanser, moisturizer, and a favorite lip balm.","Novice and veteran travelers alike will find a lot to love in Copenhagen.

Theater,"At Salzburg Festival, a Thrilling Provocation and a Promise Unfulfilled",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/theater/salzburg-festival-thomas-ostermeier-youth-without-god.html,"SALZBURG, Austria -- At the beginning of ""Youth Without God,"" the first new theater production at this year's Salzburg Festival, the actor Jorg Hartmann climbs onstage and poses a question to the audience: ""What do I owe to Adolf Hitler?"" ""The question can be answered in a single word,"" he continues. ""Everything!"" The next five minutes or so are a lofty paean to the Fuhrer, taken from an archival 1935 letter written by an ordinary German, identified as Horst R. from Braunschweig. The repeated mentions of Hitler and use of tainted Nazi terminology made the well-heeled audience the other night wince and squirm in their creaky seats. A collective sigh of relief passed through the theater once Mr. Hartmann finished this recitation and stated for the viewers that Odon von Horvath wrote the novel ""Youth Without God"" in 1937, several miles from Salzburg.

This bracing prologue has been added to an adaptation of Horvath's book by the director Thomas Ostermeier, and it gets you juiced for any further provocations over the next two intermissionless hours. But then things take a far more conventional turn, as we settle in for a dramatically astute evening that is sensitively done but doesn't have much bite.

When Mr. Ostermeier, the artistic director of the Schaubuhne in Berlin, was invited to work at Salzburg, he accepted on one condition. He told the organizers of the luxurious festival, which draws members of the 1 percent to this jewel-like alpine city each summer, that he would do the job only if he could put on ""Youth Without God."" Speaking to The New York Times earlier this year, Mr. Ostermeier said that the rightward shift in Austria -- where the far-right Freedom Party was part of the governing coalition until May -- was the chief reason he wanted to stage Horvath's novel about a humanistic high school teacher confronted by his Nazi-indoctrinated pupils.

In ""Youth Without God,"" a high school teacher in an unnamed German town watches as his pupils uncritically absorb fascist dogma. He looks on with a mixture of disgust, helplessness and, mostly, inertia. When a student dies on a camping trip, he is forced to make a moral choice that has unforeseen consequences for the murder trial that ensues. In a departure for Mr. Ostermeier, who is known for startlingly contemporary productions, in which actors frequently break the fourth wall during their sweaty, acrobatic performances, the Salzburg production features period costumes and props. The few modern accouterments include some live video projections and onstage microphones, into which several actors whisper the teacher's inner thoughts. The novel ""Youth Without God"" is closer to an existentialist parable than an anti-Nazi manual, something that Mr. Ostermeier, who makes no hero of the teacher, clearly understands. Mr. Hartmann invests the role with stubbornness and vulnerability, and gives an ambivalent, not especially likable performance. Horvath himself was no stranger to moral quandary and compromise. Even after he had relocated from Germany to Austria in 1933, the writer struggled -- and failed -- to reassure the Nazi regime of his respectability. By highlighting the teacher's isolation and indecision, Mr. Ostermeier suggests a parallel between the author and his protagonist, both of whom react to external circumstances with indecision and cowardice. It is one of the more interesting and involved ideas in a stage adaptation (by Mr. Ostermeier and Florian Borchmeyer) that otherwise seems faithful to a fault. Compared with other recent versions of ""Youth Without God,"" including Zeno Way's in Stuttgart and Nurkan Erpulat's at the Maxim Gorki Theater in Berlin, the Salzburg production comes across as stifled.

The question on my mind the entire evening was: What was gained from putting the novel onstage more or less as it is written? Page to stage adaptations can bring out multiple narrative layers, or deconstruct their source material. But unlike two recent productions adapted from novels at the Schaubuhne -- Mr. Ostermeier's thrilling ""History of Violence"" (which will soon be seen at St. Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn) and Simon McBurney's searing version of Stefan Zweig's ""Beware of Pity"" -- this ""Youth Without God"" is hemmed in by its focus on the various twists and turns of the novel's plot. It seems less an interpretation than a carbon copy of the original.

That impression sadly persists despite the dynamic performances from the members of the Schaubuhne's ensemble who populate the sparse stage, often empty save for a forest of leafless trees at the back. Unlike Mr. Hartmann, the remaining seven actors assume multiple roles. Laurenz Laufenberg is agitated and enraged as Z., the student who stands trial for murder. He also dons a frock, and a mix of arrogance and cynicism, as the priest who utters what is perhaps the novel's most memorable and chilling line: ""God is the most terrible thing in the world."" Alina Stiegler has feral energy as Z.'s clandestine love-interest, Eva, and Bernardo Arias Porras brings welcome eccentricity to the role of Julius Caesar, a disgraced colleague of the teacher. At the end, the audience's response to the actors and the production team was thunderous. Mr. Ostermeier has furnished the Salzburg Festival with a hit. But unlike Horvath's clammy and disquieting novel, the production feels, on the whole, a bit too safe. Especially given the director's expressed motives for doing this play in Salzburg, it would have been refreshing to see him ruffle the Austrian elite's feathers with something more incisive and incendiary. For those who still remembered it by the end of the evening, the love letter to Hitler at the beginning felt like an empty provocation. Youth Without God. Directed by Thomas Ostermeier.

Automobiles,Terrafugia Transition,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/automobiles/terrafugia-transition.html,"The ideal flying car might take to the roads and the skies with equal aplomb, but Carl Dietrich, a co-founder of Terrafugia in Woburn, Mass., is unapologetic about the raison d'etre of his company's Transition. ""We think of it as a street-legal airplane,"" he said. ""It's an airplane that has the capability of driving safely on roads and highways and parking in a single-car garage.""

As such, the target customer for the $279,000 Transition is someone who regularly takes trips of 100 to 500 miles and wants to be able to fly directly between local or regional airports, then drive to a destination unfettered by bad weather, traffic or speed traps. Mr. Dietrich noted that one customer intended to tow his Transition behind an R.V.: ""They have their car, their plane, their house in one mobile package, and they can do whatever the hell they want."" The current version of the two-seat Transition has been in flight and road testing for two years, Mr. Dietrich said, logging multiple flights at altitudes up to 7,000 feet. Its fuel-injected 4-cylinder Rotax 912iS engine produces 100 horsepower and runs on auto fuel, driving the rear wheels on the ground and a pusher propeller in the air. Cruising speeds are about 100 m.p.h. in the air and about 70 m.p.h. on the road. The transition from car to plane -- as the wings fold down -- takes about a minute in addition to a preflight check.

Terrafugia is taking $10,000 deposits for the Transition and hopes to start deliveries in the second quarter of 2016.

Regardless of whether that target is met, the company is already looking ahead. The hybrid electric TF-X concept would be a ""semiautonomous"" vehicle, limiting the driver-pilot's hands-on involvement to decisions about takeoff and landing sites, and last-minute assessments about the weather.",The current version of the two-seat Transition has been in flight and road testing for two years.

Fashion & Style,"Rocking It on Prom Night, African Style",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/12/fashion/prom-dresses-african-style.html,"This spring, Azara Bernard, 18, turned to her sister, Archel Bernard, a designer in her native Liberia, to whip up a dress for her prom in Atlanta. ""I wanted to wear the most beautiful and vibrant blue print I could find, one that would highlight my difference,"" she said. ""I feel like our generation is getting more proud of where we come from,"" she went on. ""We're our own little African goddesses. I want to represent that."" Julie Cheeks, a 17-year-old high school senior from Providence, R.I., chose a stylized West African pattern on a crimson ground to wear to her prom last week. ""I wanted to show my culture,"" said Ms. Cheeks, who is Liberian. ""I wanted my classmates to get a taste of what African style looks like.""

More often than not, their red carpet is Instagram, where, grouped under hashtags like #blackgirlmagic and #blackgirlsrock, they celebrate their fashion sense, and their heritage, in kaleidoscopically colorful African prints. Until recently, ""African style, it wasn't cool,"" said Ms. Bernard, the designer. It's cool now, she maintained, expressive of a sociocultural shift that's been years in the making. ""The trend stems today from the larger culture of black women embracing themselves and their beauty,"" said Veronica Wells, an associate editor of MadameNoire, a web-based style guide for young black women. Once on that path, Ms. Wells said, ""you start wanting to investigate your roots and your background, and start distancing yourself from a strictly European standard of beauty."" No question that in their shape-enhancing dresses, made from traditional Ghanaian, Senegalese or Liberian fabrics, many of these women have become internet sensations. When Daniella Eta, 17, made her entrance at her prom in Cincinnati, wearing a dress of Kente cloth, she could not have anticipated the response. The snapshot of Ms. Eta, posted on Instagram on the night of her prom, ricocheted around the web.

""All night, the notifications kept on coming,"" she said. ""By morning, I realized that over 40 famous Instagram accounts had posted my prom photo."" Still, such reactions are scarcely a match for those overwhelming the woman who arguably started it all. A year ago, Kyemah McEntyre, 19, conceived and sketched the floor-length bouffant gown she wore to her prom in East Orange, N.J., in homage to the dashiki, the elaborately patterned tunic widely adopted in this country in the 1960s as an emblem of black pride. Ms. McEntyre's dress was intended to fly in the face of convention -- and conventional notions of beauty.

Today Ms. McEntyre, 19, a student at Parsons School of Design in New York, has a capsule line of her own and a client list that has included Tyra Banks and Naturi Naughton, the lead in the Starz drama ""Power."" ""I do feel I've inspired a lot of women,"" Ms. McEntyre said, a small catch in her voice. ""That was actually the point of it all."" In some quarters, the concept of an Afrocentric prom dress can still raise eyebrows. ""After discussing how beautiful it was and that I would do an African theme with a teacher, I was told it wasn't really 'something you wear to prom,'"" Makalaya Zanders posted this month on her Instagram account.

She stuck with her plan nonetheless. ""I wanted to make a point, that I am comfortable with my Melanin and roots,"" she wrote. One can hear in her argument echoes of an earlier era. Teta Gorgoni, a partner with her daughter, Maya, in Royal Jelly Harlem, an African-inspired fashion line, recalled: ""There was a time in the '60s when I was coming into my own identity, the time of 'black is beautiful' -- the head wraps, the natural hair, the iconic role models like Angela Davis. I'm reminded of that.""

Today the trend derives much of its impetus from Twitter and Instagram hashtags like #blackgirlmagic, #melaninpoppin and #melaninonfleek, said Danielle Canada, an editor at Bossip, a web destination covering African-American pop culture and entertainment. ""We started to see it last year, but it's really picked up this year,"" she said. ""Definitely, this trend has gone national."" The movement, if it is that, is inspired by and reflected in ballyhooed events like the Afro-punk Festival, held each year in Paris, Brooklyn and Atlanta; in Broadway productions like ""Eclipsed,"" its star, Lupita Nyong'o, a dark-skinned role model for many young black women, swathed in a mash-up of Liberian prints; and at art fairs around the country showcasing, among other African artists, works by Yinka Shonibare, whose mannequins are draped in giddily patterned Afro-colonial garb. High-wattage personalities have played a part. Solange Knowles, who at one time used Dutch-African prints as her aesthetic signature, makes no secret of her motivation. ""Fashion is political,"" she said. ""In my connection to prints, I've been making a political statement.""

""The moment I wear what I wear, you can see me,"" she said. ""There is no way to avoid seeing me."" Others seem bent on following her lead and, more recently, that of her more famous sister. ""It doesn't hurt that Beyonce is often photographed in African prints,"" Ms. Bernard said. In fact, the star and her celebrity ilk have been photographed wearing the high-end, riotously patterned frocks of Stella Jean, a Milan-based label, and African-pattern designs of Valentino, Prada and Junya Watanabe, as well. Others, less established, are starting to make waves. In addition to its off-the-rack creations, Royal Jelly Harlem sells custom-designed gowns in Ghanese, Senegalese, Liberian and Malian textiles, priced at $475 to $895. ""The demand for African-inspired dresses has been growing for the past two or three years,"" said Kimberley Mensah-Aborampa, whose Ghanaian-pattern special occasion and prom gowns sell on Etsy for about $90 each. In Ghana, where Ms. Mensah-Aborampa works part of each year, ""these patterns aren't special,"" she said. ""But here African prints for prom dresses are the in thing."" No need to clue in De'Andre Crenshaw, the Cleveland designer who dreamed up the dashiki-inspired prom dress worn by his friend and muse, Ms. Zanders. ""When that dress went on the web,"" he said, ""I received calls from everywhere: Africa, London and even China. This was new for me. It's been a lot because I'm working on my own."" At Indelible Couture, his company, business is surging, Mr. Crenshaw said: ""I had to go buy a new sewing machine.""",A new breed of style stars celebrate their heritage in a mash-up of prints.,cda1d32e-df5d-5200-97a7-2cf94311ce0b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/12/fashion/12PROM/12PROM-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=092a2472d9c1b713e91db6e3a1590226437ec3b26bc1488e979649090f8139f7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Aisha Bernard, 23, foreground, and Azara Bernard, 18, in Afrocentric dresses designed by their sister, Archel Bernard.",cda1d32e-df5d-5200-97a7-2cf94311ce0b,N24News/imgs/cda1d32e-df5d-5200-97a7-2cf94311ce0b.jpg,19
Style,9 Places to Get a Gorgeous Tattoo,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/style/where-to-get-a-tattoo.html,"Many of the top tattoo artists in the country command sky-high prices and have mile-long wait lists. Some of the shops listed here are no exception, but at least a few of them will be able to give you a an appointment in the near future, and charge a reasonable price.

If you're looking for a great black-and-gray tattoo, Kevin Yang of Blackfish Tattoo can help. His shop's Instagram feed is filled with examples of the large-scale work -- sleeves, full backs -- that should cost a fraction of the rates at Keith McCurdy's Bang Bang.

Humor is not always apparent among realistic tattooers, which is why it's refreshing to see Zlata Kolomoyskaya inscribe wit into her seemingly flawless fine-line work. One of her recent pieces portrays a small boy in overalls, his hands on his hips, facing down a lion. Another shows a schnauzer dressed up in business attire. And her portraits of Malcolm X, Angelina Jolie and other famous folk are spot on.

Smith Street Tattoo, in Caroll Gardens since 2008, is perhaps the most renowned parlor doing American traditional work. If you're looking for a brightly colored serpent, a skull and crossbones, or an eagle, this is the place to go.

King's Avenue is the reigning place in New York City for Japanese sleeves. To get an appointment with Mike Rubendall, the owner, you'll probably have to add your name to a wait list. But the roughly 20 artists working with him are skilled at a variety of styles and may be easier to book. For neo-traditional florals, felines or undersea creatures, Becca Genne Bacon can deliver.

Calling Fun City Tattoo the best tattoo parlor on St. Marks Place is a little unfair. It's the only really good tattoo parlor on St. Marks Place, and one of the best in the city. The owner and lead tattooer is Big Steve, whose sexy roses, fear-stoking snakes and big birds blend elements of black-and-gray realism and American traditional tattooing. His wait list is growing, but two associates -- Preston Taylor and Simone Sorbi -- are also excellent.

Ocho Placas has something for everyone. Among its artists are Samantha Mancino (an expert at fine-line black and gray) and Javier Betancourt (who renders beautifully detailed neo-traditional work).

Stefano Alcantara, a protege of Paul Booth's at Last Rites Gallery who does surreal black-and-gray portraiture, lives in Fort Lauderdale but is often on tour. He charges about $400 an hour, though you can try paying more to jump the line.",Body art is expensive.

Automobiles,"Celebrating Its Pony-Car Success, Camaro Goes Topless",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/20/automobiles/autoreviews/chevy-camaro-convertible.html,"Chevrolet seems to think that was a blessing in disguise for two reasons: the convertible arrives at what its marketers consider an optimal time to rekindle interest and sales in the current-generation car, which made its debut in 2009. Also, the supplier that replaced the original top maker delivered a much better unit. The roof is nicely shaped (not like the usual ribbed Conestoga-style top); is water- and weather-tight; and is acoustically dead-quiet.

One of the main complaints about the handsome coupe has been the poor visibility from its turretlike cabin. That issue is pretty much gone, of course, with the hardtop removed. And with the top up, visibility is no worse than in the claustrophobic coupe.

There are tradeoffs, including a more cramped rear seat, less trunk space and a weight gain of about 125 pounds  a result of extra chassis bracing. The bracing seems well integrated; engineers said that's because the 21st century Camaro was designed from the start to be built as a convertible. The convertible mechanism and softtop, in either black or tan, are also about 125 pounds heavier than the hardtop they replace.

A longtime complaint about Camaro convertibles  dating from the late 1960s  was that they came with absolutely harrowing levels of cowl shake, steering column vibration and torsional sloppiness. Early models were so bad in this regard that G.M. parts departments actually offered shims to keep the doors from flying open when going through twists and turns, and ""cocktail shakers"" to keep the wheels on the ground. The euphemism for this level of chassis compliance was ""boulevard ride.""

But for the new convertible, Chevy intentionally moved away from the old-school wet-dishrag sensation to a more controlled ride with tighter tolerances.

The new model is built with so much attention to suspension integrity that the engineers decided to apply the convertible's calibrations to the coupes, improving the entire Camaro line. ""It's a rolling production change that is being applied to the coupes, too, going forward,"" Russ Clark, Camaro's product marketing director, said during a test drive in and around San Diego.

At the wheel, I could sense some significant vibrations at highway speeds on the worst washboard pavement, but nothing on the order of the all-time champ: the wobbly (and justifiably defunct) Chevy SSR pickup. G.M.'s engineers seem to have learned some valuable lessons: for a convertible, I would have to rate the Camaro's overall handling very highly.","The Camaro, which outsold the rival Ford Mustang last year for the first time a in quarter century, now arrives in a convertible version.",8f9c7ebf-83d1-581f-b728-aa7cc8861a84,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/17/automobiles/Camaro/Camaro-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=260eaa8a32d158fed0512f9b695564f61dc57d3ae63ec80ed8160ec13fdc6cb7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,FASHIONABLY LATE A year's delay may have made the Camaro droptop better.,8f9c7ebf-83d1-581f-b728-aa7cc8861a84,N24News/imgs/8f9c7ebf-83d1-581f-b728-aa7cc8861a84.jpg,23
Opinion,I Love My Twin. How Did We End Up So Far Apart?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/04/opinion/2020-election-trump-family.html,"Once, when we were 5 years old, my twin brother jumped off a seesaw we were riding at the precise moment that we had been told never to do that. I was in the air, and he was on the ground, and when he made his move I came crashing rapidly and horrifically down. I still remember the short burst of terror I felt, and the body-shaking thud that followed. But I also remember that the crash hurt him more than it hurt me. I wasn't injured. His guilt was so great that nearly four decades later, he still gets upset when I tell this story. We are best friends, my twin and I. Our relationship predates our actual lives, and except for the seesaw incident, we have never been on opposite sides of anything that could hurt one of us -- until recently. He believes that Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden are the biggest threats to our ailing democracy, that Donald Trump is doing a fine job -- maybe not great, but definitely not terrible -- and that the mainstream media (of which I am a part) is biased in its coverage of the president.

I don't just disagree with these views, I find them unfathomable. I think that Donald Trump is a liar, a racist, an authoritarian and a criminal. I think he's a disgrace to the office he holds and to the nation at large, and I'm worried that American democracy would not survive another four years of his leadership. I also think that the entire Republican Party is complicit in his ascension and so bears responsibility for the broader national crisis we are now facing. My brother and I have tried talking through this divide, but we get too angry too quickly. We have tried not discussing the situation at all, but it keeps bubbling up in text messages and our weekly catch-up sessions. (We make it a point to talk every Saturday, at least.) I know that we're not alone in our predicament, that so many people around the country are going through some version of this with their family members. But the loss of common ground between him and me feels singular, sharp and surprisingly devastating given that it does not involve an actual death.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" I keep trying to understand how we got here. Our parents are lifelong Democrats. Our father was a garment worker, in a union whose roots ran back to the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. (He still carries his own father's union card in his wallet.) In the mid-1990s, though, that union was decimated. The bosses closed the garment factories and shipped the work down to Mexico, and our father, who was in his mid-50s, never found steady employment again. We lost our home to a bank foreclosure in the wake of that shift. We were still teenagers. I don't think it ever occurred to our parents to blame the Democratic Party -- or President Bill Clinton, or his disastrous trade policies -- for what befell us. The way they saw it, the party had fought for the unions that protected them for so long, and for the safety net that helped sustain them when those unions failed.

They had also spent their lives steeped in the notion that hard work and decency were enough to make a good life, and so when hard times came they assumed that the corollary was also true: that if they had failed to maintain their good life, they must not have worked hard enough or lived decently enough. They internalized their failure, in other words. They absorbed it deep into their bones, until it hobbled them. My siblings and I were too consumed by the sudden challenges of getting by to think much about the larger forces shaping our lives. My brother worked a few odd jobs before becoming a landscaper. I clawed my way through college and graduate school, and eventually became a journalist. These paths have never felt all that disparate to me. We both love what we do and take great pride in our work; ""Do it right, or don't do it at all,"" our father would say. We have both worked long hours for low pay, and we both worry obsessively about maintaining the financial ground we have gained since those times. And who can blame us after what we went through as teenagers? But lately it seems our differences have become greater than our similarities. I'm a city dweller who spends her days in front of the computer and occasionally travels abroad for work. He's a suburban homeowner who earns his living through physical labor. The Democratic Party has kept me, but lost him. What I still see as the party of labor unions, health insurance and tax policies that favor the middle class, he sees as the party of elitist liberals, out of touch with working-class folks like him. Part of the problem, a part we both acknowledge, is that our information comes from very different places. I read newspapers; he listens to conservative talk shows and watches cable news -- and algorithms ensure that our internet searches never subject us to divergent viewpoints. But the other problem runs deeper than that: The political norms of the moment compel everyone to pick a side and to then refuse to hear the other side out, on anything. For liberals, that means that all Trump supporters are at best complete fools who vote against their own interests out of sheer stupidity, and at worst virulent racists not to be engaged with on any level. On one hand, I get those feelings. I have a hard time understanding how anyone could come down on the side of Mr. Trump's Republicans.

On the other, though, we are talking about a substantial portion of the country -- about our friends and neighbors and our own kin. And while I think my brother is wrong about quite a lot, I know he is not wrong about everything. After decades of politicians talking, he still doesn't have health insurance; he earns too much to qualify for an Obamacare subsidy but too little to afford his own comprehensive coverage. He worries, rightly, about what liberal immigration policies, minimum-wage laws and health insurance mandates will do to the small business where he works, and he is anxious about tax increases of any kind and what they would do to his own monthly balance sheet. He has heaved himself from a life of mere subsistence into the middle class, bought a home and built a life, through the sheer force of his own will. And he is terrified of losing that. In the past two weeks, I've read a deluge of stories about friendships dissolving over political differences, about people disowning their flesh and blood. I can't bear the thought of that. I still send my twin articles, including ones my colleagues have written, about Mr. Trump's foreign policy, which I think makes us less safe in the world, about his grift and graft, and about how his tax policies favor the very rich at the expense of people like us. In turn, he has sent me podcasts and web videos denouncing Joe Biden's connections to China and Hunter Biden's doings in Ukraine. We aren't penetrating each other's realities. But we haven't fully lost each other yet, either. In our last call before election night, we screamed about who was selling who out to which foreign country, in one breathless exchange. In the next, I reminded him to order eyeglasses and he begged me to stay safe if I ventured out after dark. I'm not sure how we get through this moment, but I don't think it will end when the election is called, or when the new year begins, or when the next president is sworn in. I have prayed as hard as a person can these past few months that Democrats will win in big sweeping landslides and that American democracy will prevail. But I've known for much longer than that -- for my entire life, in fact -- that I can never truly win anything if it means losing my twin. I don't know where that leaves us. I only know that he is my brother, and I love him.",The Democrats kept me but lost him.,50ec55e1-2f36-566a-bd42-2b51b415f4b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/03/opinion/03interlandi/03interlandi-facebookJumbo-v9.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a9196b01cc1111bb65f37ae0341638e8dcef0276dc41ee37062dae7374ad39c8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,50ec55e1-2f36-566a-bd42-2b51b415f4b0,N24News/imgs/50ec55e1-2f36-566a-bd42-2b51b415f4b0.jpg,11
Art & Design,In Their Words: Remembering I.M. Pei,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/18/arts/design/im-pei-architecture.html,"I.M. Pei, who died May 16 at age 102, was endlessly charming, with a wide smile and impeccable manners. Competitors were sometimes thrown off by the unflappable geniality, since he was a shrewd competitor, adept at luring clients and pleasing them. He was also passionate about the power of architecture. People in the field who were close to him, recalling him after his death, said that the warmth was innate and not for show. ""You think of architects who seem to lead with their ego, and he was never like that,"" said David Childs, a consulting design partner with SOM , a firm that often competed with Pei's. ""He was very generous to me when I was a 28-year-old kid."" He first encountered Pei while working on the staff of the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, a redevelopment agency in Washington. Pei wanted to know the precise angle of the avenue in relationship to the National Mall. That relationship would become the basis of his design of interlocking triangles for the famed East Building of the National Gallery of Art. ""He was gentle in demeanor but forceful in his convictions,"" added Mr. Childs. Here are recollections of colleagues, erstwhile competitors and friends on Pei's enduring legacy.

Guy Nordenson A structural engineer, who has worked with the firm Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, Mr. Nordenson collects Pei stories. Recognizing that he was an underdog choice for the design of the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston, Pei learned what he could about Jacqueline Kennedy, who would make the choice. For her visit, ""He had the office redone, every detail in place, down to placing flowers he knew she liked in the reception area."" Pei's legendary charm and self-effacing manner endeared him promptly to Mrs. Kennedy, and she chose him for the library that would rise on Columbia Point on the Boston waterfront.

David Adjaye The Ghanaian-born architect, who is based in London, designed the Smithsonian Museum of African American History and Culture, down the Washington Mall from Pei's wing of the National Gallery. He ""locked onto Pei quite early,"" he said, even though Pei was at the time anything but fashionable among young architects. ""I related to his very distinct trajectory as an immigrant who comes to America, makes it his home and finds an ability to read the local landscape,"" said Mr. Adjaye, who has an office in New York. ""He quickly understands how to make an American building. Then he translates it to other places."" Later in Pei's career, the Fragrant Hill Hotel, a modest rambling structure built around beloved trees and gardens in an ancient hunting preserve outside Beijing, marked his architectural return to his native China. ""He goes back to Suzhou, China, where he comes from, this city of gardens with an amazing pedigree of architecture,"" Mr. Adjaye said.

Renzo Piano ""I met I.M. Pei in Paris when he was working on the Louvre with the engineer Peter Rice,"" said Mr. Piano, the Genoa and Paris-based architect, speaking by phone from a taxi. Rice was among the most admired structural engineers of the time, helping Pei realize the extraordinarily delicate glass pyramid entrance to the museum. ""They were sitting at a table with pizza, and they were talking about working with light,"" Mr. Piano added. ""The poetic for me is walking below the pyramid on the lacy shadows cast by the steel and crystal above.""

The firm's dedication to innovation and the expressive use of engineering led to the most traumatic events in its history. The nearly complete John Hancock building in Boston began shedding gigantic sheets of glass in 1973. The building did not open for years, at vast additional cost. Disputes over the design almost put the firm out of business. ""They hung together,"" recalled Mr. Nordenson. Pei's partner on the project, Henry N. Cobb, ""was at the vanguard of vanquishing that crisis and he did it in a very sophisticated way,"" Mr. Nordenson continued. ""They addressed the issues head on and were able to keep the confidence of the client.""

Billie Tsien ""He was an incredible gentleman and very generous with us, even though he did not know us well,"" said Ms. Tsien, a founder of the New York firm Tod Williams Billie Tsien. ""He had been asked to design an Asian library at the University of California at Berkeley, and he suggested us instead. That was for me a very important project because it connects East and West, which I feel is what my whole life has been about."" Ms. Tsien sees ""a thread"" between the Kennedy library and the Barack Obama Presidential Library in Chicago that her firm is designing. She saw that exhibitions at the Kennedy library were reconfigured as the early emphasis on the assassination faded over time, ""and the importance of his family history and other achievements came forward."" Mr. Pei's library ""taught us that the building needs to be clear and strong as a marker, but flexible enough to change inside."" Calvin Tsao Working as a young architect in Pei's firm before forming his own, Tsao & McKown, Mr. Tsao recalled that ""he was one of my most profound mentors. When he saw a good idea he would always push you to take it farther. But he would always acknowledge your authorship."" ""Detail was key for him,"" he said. ""He cared about the details of the relationship with the client and of the design."" Mr. Tsao was supposed to have lunch with Pei last Monday, but Pei's nurse said he wasn't feeling well. Mr. Tsao left on a business trip only to learn of Pei's death on his return. ""I learned persistence and perseverance from him -- and the power of charm, which is not easy to learn."" When Mr. Tsao left Pei's office to form his own firm, ""his parting words were, 'don't get seduced by sexy projects. A good client will nurture you. Pick your client, not the project.'""","The Modernist master left his mark on generations, from Renzo Piano and Norman Foster to David Adjaye and Billie Tsien.",9afc3607-3e74-53e3-87b6-1e5b4479d2c6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/arts/17pei-architects3/17pei-architects3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=b2dbcc366b4892b038cd97ba0675b464a78e5a2c369096cbe83ba832743aa7ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Visitors inside I.M.

Theater,Making Magic Out of Thin Air,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/theater/acrobuffos-new-victory-air-play.html,"The idea started small and has -- what's the word? -- ballooned since then. In 2010 Christina Gelsone and Seth Bloom, a husband-and-wife clowning duo who go by the name Acrobuffos, saw the work of the kinetic sculptor Daniel Wurtzel, who in creations like ""Pas de Deux"" and ""Air Fountain"" sends huge swatches of colorful silk swirling in the air with carefully placed electric fans. Acrobuffos first thought that ""Pas de Deux"" could be worked into a sort of omnibus clown act, alongside shtick from ""Water Bombs,"" a ""water balloon gladiator show"" they've toured as a street-theater piece in Europe. But once they started to work with Mr. Wurtzel's fans and fabric, they quickly realized, as Ms. Gelsone put it: ""This is actually its own thing. We have to make a whole show with this.""

As they've toured the world, Acrobuffos have had a crash course in the physics of air in enclosed spaces, battling venues over their HVAC systems -- they must be off during the show -- and learning that even the most state-of-the-art theaters have air leaks and are subtly subject to exterior weather conditions. What's more, Ms. Gelsone said, ""I have to find out how many people are going to be in the audience, because I have to know how hot the house is going to be."" Why? Because the heat from a large crowd is like a magnet for floating material, particularly the balloons, which risk ""totally getting sucked off the stage."" ""So now,"" she said, ""in all those hot houses, Seth and I actually pull the act back three feet.""

One section of ""Air Play"" has Mr. Bloom and Ms. Gelsone ""juggle"" balloons that hover at eye level atop strings as if they were human dance partners -- a seemingly simple trick that has taken painstaking trial and error to pull off. Not only do the weight of the strings and the texture of the balloons have to be standard; Mr. Bloom also has a preshow ritual of filling the balloons with precisely uniform amounts of helium. To accomplish this feat, the show's longtime technical director, Todd Little, said that Mr. Bloom uses a limited-edition device called ""the Inflatinator,"" whose air flow can be calibrated ""down to the hundredths of a second.""

The physics of air flow isn't the only practical science the ""Air Play"" duo have picked up on the job. They've also learned to ""de-staticize"" their playing area, because static electricity can lead balloons to pop, which isn't just a prop-killer; one loud pop in close proximity meant that Mr. Bloom lost hearing in his left ear for a little bit. Even the two large latex balloons the duo climb into at one point benefit from special treatment, though this is something of a trade secret, Ms. Gelsone said: ""You don't even want to know what we do to the big balloons to keep them consistent.""

In the years since Acrobuffos began building it, ""Air Play"" has racked up close to 150 performances, from China to Chile to the Netherlands, and they've had the same technical director, Mr. Little, and stage manager, Flora Vassar. Ms. Vassar has learned to adapt the show's lighting and sound cues to a dizzying variety of international venues, and Mr. Little has occasionally been called on as a sort of silent stage partner: In one show, when an electric fan died, he rushed backstage with a leaf blower to correct the flow of the balloons.

The show's development, which included a 2014 workshop at the New Victory as part of the company's LabWorks program, has led Acrobuffos away from their manic street-performing style toward a more narrative piece that Ms. Gelsone described as ""a philosophical expedition into what air is."" And it isn't just about bodies in space but about time. ""It's hard to slow people down enough in the street to enjoy a moment of poetry,"" Mr. Bloom said. The show has tried to capture some of the feeling of viewing Mr. Wurtzel's air sculptures in a museum. ""Initially we were worried, 'Is this piece too long?'"" Mr. Bloom said. ""The answer has been no. We can see it when the audience slows down and gets into our rhythm. We can't do that outdoors."" Of course, that's not the only thing that keeps ""Air Play"" indoors, he added: ""We can't do this outdoors because it would blow all over the place.""","How do married clowns make wordless wizardry with balloons, umbrellas, packing peanuts and fabric? Turn on those electric fans.",813af8fe-56bb-52cb-83d5-a589a1f0a502,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/25/arts/25AIRPLAY6/25AIRPLAY6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bad6bde0e3ef338c8876d43f9cf6a1d35716151dae4dcfc37835782cc60e56c5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Christina Gelsone, left, and Seth Bloom, a duo known as Acrobuffos, during a performance at the Tennessee Performing Arts Center.",813af8fe-56bb-52cb-83d5-a589a1f0a502,N24News/imgs/813af8fe-56bb-52cb-83d5-a589a1f0a502.jpg,10
Science,Look What the Cat Dragged In: Parasites,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/science/cats-outdoors-viruses.html,"Domestic animals can contract parasites from insects and ticks, prey, soil or other animals and can spread them to humans, pets or wildlife. Dogs can give humans rabies, and cows can give people a diarrhea-causing parasite called Cryptosporidium. But dogs often only go outside with their owners on leashes, and cows don't usually get to snuggle on our sofas.

Cats lead different lives. They may go out hunting on their own and return for a nap on their person's lap or bed. And the diseases cats can spread can be pretty virulent, from cat-scratch fever to a parasite called toxoplasma gondii, the litter-box parasite that doctors tell pregnant women and immune-compromised people to avoid. Cats also can spread feline immunodeficiency virus, which makes them more susceptible to parasites, and spread it to other cats, even cougars.

To Ms. Chalkowski, the indoor/outdoor dichotomy of cats' lives presented an opportunity to better understand how environmental exposure may put them at risk.

She and her team compared data from 21 studies -- in countries ranging from the United States, Europe and Australia to Pakistan, Chile and Brazil -- that documented parasitic infections in pet cats living strictly indoors, or with outdoor access -- excluding feral cats. They also homed in on particular parasites like the ones already mentioned, which have potential to spill over into other animals.

""Over so many different studies, with so many different parasites, in so many different countries: No matter where you keep your cat indoors, it reduces risk of parasitic infection,"" Ms. Chalkowski said.",Researchers found that house cats that roam outdoors were more likely to pick up diseases than indoor cats.,14ff0a84-a369-51ab-ba2b-53f6b4bd56fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/23/science/17tb-cats/17tb-cats-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=26222ed443aef39e40ad1260ea2b08319a5384682c2da75c455dc40c5e8b2d6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Cats can contract parasites from insects, prey, soil or other animals and can spread them to humans, pets or wildlife.",14ff0a84-a369-51ab-ba2b-53f6b4bd56fb,N24News/imgs/14ff0a84-a369-51ab-ba2b-53f6b4bd56fb.jpg,2
Automobiles,The Note in the Trunk of the Last Studebaker Avanti,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/20/automobiles/the-note-in-the-trunk-of-the-last-studebaker-avanti.html,"On Dec. 31, 1963, W.H. Bennett Sr., a worker at the Studebaker factory in South Bend, Ind., wrote a note in his smooth longhand. He then folded the note, stuffed it into an envelope marked ""To Whom It May Concern"" in the same script and placed it beneath the liner in the trunk of Studebaker Avanti No. R-5643, the last car to come off the line there. ""This 1964 Model Avanti was the last one built in South Bend, Ind. Serial #5643 Body #3902 Line 717 W.H. Bennett Sr. 4739. Happy New Year."" About a year later, George E. Westin, the assistant vice president of the Land Title Guarantee and Trust Company in Warren, Ohio, found the letter in the trunk of the car that he had ordered at Jerry's Auto Sales of Warren in October 1963. On Dec. 15, 1964, he sent a letter to Studebaker asking the company to confirm that his car was indeed the last one off the assembly line. Studebaker confirmed on Jan. 5, 1965, that R- 5643, which had been completed on Dec. 26, 1963, was the last Avanti it built.

According to documents provided by the Western Reserve Historical Society, where the car is now on display, Mr. Westin placed an ad for the car in Motor Trend magazine two weeks later. His asking price was $7,000 or best offer. Documentation from Studebaker shows that R-5643, which was equipped with a supercharged R3 engine, manual steering, front and rear seatbelts and twin traction, Studebaker's version of limited slip, was originally listed for $4,883.48. It was one of only a few with the high-performance engine option.

Mr. Westin didn't sell the car until late 1966 or early 1967, to Joe Erdelac, who owned an American Motors dealership in Cleveland. A letter from Mr. Westin to Mr. Erdelac on Dec. 14, 1966, provides a list of documentation included with the car. But no one knows the exact date of the sale. Mr. Westin and Mr. Erdelac are both dead, and neither Connie Erdelac, Mr. Erdelac's daughter, nor Derek E. Moore, curator of transportation history at the Western Reserve Historical Society, knows when the transaction took place. But Ms. Erdelac said that it was probably in early 1967. She recalled going with her father to collect the car in Youngstown. ""On the way back to Cleveland, we went over 105 miles per hour on a country road in that car, just to test it out,"" she said.

Ms. Erdelac said her father, who owned a Studebaker dealership in the late '40s, had an affinity for Studebaker Avantis. At one time, he had as many as 12. When the Avanti Motor Company, a separate entity from Studebaker, emerged in the mid-'60s and began building the Avanti II with leftover Studebaker parts and parts from other manufacturers. Ms. Erdelac said her father obtained a license to sell the cars at his AMC dealership. ""Was my dad sentimental about being a Studebaker dealer in the 1940s? Probably,"" she said. ""But that's why he took on this car."" Joe Erdelac, the car's second owner, placed this ad in the mid-'70s, when he attempted to sell it for $100,000. But she said the last Studebaker Avanti sat in a service garage, covered up, for years. Then, in 1977, Mr. Erdelac decided it was time to sell the car. He took out full-page ads in Cleveland Magazine, Connoisseur Magazine and other publications. His asking price for R-5643 was $100,000. Nobody bought the car, and in 1979, Joe, Elsie and Connie Erdelac (all of them, together, Ms. Erdelac stressed) donated the car to the Western Reserve Historical Society, which runs the Crawford Auto Aviation Museum in Cleveland. It has been part of the museum's display ever since, and although Ms. Erdelac says it is never driven - the odometer still shows fewer than 10,000 miles - it comes out of retirement for guest appearances elsewhere from time to time. In 2012, for example, the car was shipped to South Bend, Ind., for a 50th anniversary Studebaker Avanti celebration. It was also brought to the National Mall in Washington in May as part of the Historic Vehicle Association's ""Cars at the Capital"" event, after spending about five months on display at the Studebaker National Museum in South Bend. The last Avanti to roll off the Studebaker assembly line, in Dec. 1963.

Mark Gessler, president of the association, which works with the United States Interior Department to compile the list, said that his team was working on getting R-5643 included on the National Historic Vehicle Register. While the car was parked on the National Mall, they made a 3-D scan of it, which will be included with its documentation when it is listed. To qualify for inclusion, a vehicle must satisfy one of four conditions: be associated with an important event in American history; be associated with an important person in American history; be unique or significant in terms of design, craftsmanship, engineering or aesthetic value; or be the first or last produced, or a well preserved or restored survivor. Mr. Gessler said that the Avanti definitely checks the boxes for design significance and being the last-produced car of its type. Also, Raymond Loewy, a prominent industrial designer, was the creative force behind the Avanti, which was considered cutting edge at the time. And Andrew Beckman, the archivist at the Studebaker museum, said that R-5643 was one of only nine Avantis built with the supercharged R-3 engine. ""It was the fastest production car at that time,"" Mr. Gessler said.","On Dec. 31, 1963, W.H.

Art & Design,A Popular Sight at Tate Modern: The Neighbors' Apartments,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/arts/design/tate-modern-privacy-court-case.html,"LONDON -- Just after 10 a.m. on Saturday, Daniel Huchard, 53, a French ski instructor visiting Tate Modern in London, stood on the 10th-story viewing terrace and admired one of the gallery's more unusual sights: the apartments opposite. In one, a middle-age man wearing a gray T-shirt and shorts could be seen through the floor-to-ceiling windows eating breakfast. It appeared to be a slice of toast. In another, a different middle-age man sat on a green sofa, a weekend newspaper sprawled around him. There were no signs of life in the many other apartments, some of which are only around 60 feet from the viewing terrace.

""They're very nice flats -- a lot of light, very expensive probably,"" Mr. Huchard said. But he would not live in one, he added, even if he had a spare $4.5 million, the asking price of an apartment currently on sale. ""They are like animals in a zoo,"" he said. Tate Modern's viewing terrace has been popular since it opened as part of the gallery's extension in 2016. It offers one of London's best views, taking in St. Paul's Cathedral; the Leadenhall Building, a skyscraper better known as the Cheesegrater for its distinctive appearance; the Houses of Parliament; and a swath of South London. Visitors take hundreds of selfies every day.

But the ability to walk around one side of the terrace and peek into the apartments is being challenged. In 2017, four apartment owners in the buildings, part of a development called Neo Bankside, sued Tate, the organization that runs Tate Modern and other museums in Britain, for what they claim is the ""relentless"" invasion of privacy from visitors to the terrace. The viewing platform stops the apartments being ""a secure home for young children"" because of the onlookers, they said in court papers.

In response, the gallery pointed out that plans for the construction of the platform were public knowledge when the apartments were sold. The gallery received its original planning permission for its development before the apartments, it added. At a news conference in September 2016, Nicholas Serota, then Tate's director, said that there was a simple answer to the problem: Hang curtains. But Tate's arguments did not stop the case. This month, it reached the High Court. A judgment is expected soon. Appropriately, the case has prompted an artwork. This month, Max Siedentopf, a conceptual artist, tied 10 pairs of binoculars to the terrace opposite the apartments for people to use. He called the unauthorized intervention ""Please Respect Our Neighbors' Privacy,"" the same message that appears on signs in Tate Modern. Mr. Siedentopf said in a telephone interview that he wanted to provoke thoughts about issues surrounding the case including privacy and entitlement. ""I do think it's ironic that people buy apartments that have a great view of the Tate, but the Tate is not allowed to have a great view of the apartments,"" he said. But he also just wanted to make people laugh, and highlight an uncomfortable fact for Tate: ""I think the funny part of the story is that the neighbors' apartments are actually more popular than any work on display,"" he said. Sometimes the gawking crowd ""almost resembles photos you see at the Louvre where hundreds of people gather to look at the Mona Lisa,"" he added.

Neither the apartment owners contacted through Forsters, their lawyers, nor Tate would comment while the court case was continuing. Several residents coming in and out of the building declined to be interviewed when approached. One said he lived on the opposite side of the building to Tate Modern. ""Thank God,"" he added. But on Saturday evening, there was little sympathy for the apartment owners' case from people on the viewing platform. ""If you can afford to live there, you can afford to live somewhere else, can't you?"" said Nimai Inniss, 24, who was showing two Spanish friends the view. ""I think the sheer gall of people to move in somewhere like that and then complain about the fact there's a museum across the road tells you a lot about where London's going."" Reinholds Bunde, a software engineer in London who is originally from Latvia, pointed out that the residents could look into each others' homes and anyone could look into many of the apartments from the street below. ""I don't think they have a point,"" he said, when asked about the case. ""If you live in a city, and you have windows, people look in."" ""I've seen naked people from my flat, across the road, just getting dressed,"" he added. ""If you don't close the blinds people look in. Someone's probably seen me naked."" As he spoke, a woman appeared in one of the windows and put some items into a dishwasher. ""That's the first person I've ever seen,"" said Mr. Bunde, a regular visitor to the gallery. ""They're always empty.""","A court is to decide whether the London museum's viewing terrace invades the privacy of residents opposite. For now, many visitors still enjoy the view.",12c498f6-dcff-53a5-9ef9-6cc0c0f1da48,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/23/arts/23tate-1/20tate-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3e251ceb15b84124d4e965ce8fb25bb94eb14f45288edf2afa103b991f643753&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Looking into an apartment building opposite Tate Modern with binoculars tied to the viewing terrace as part of an unauthorized installation this month.

Technology,"Blockchain Will Be Theirs, Russian Spy Boasted at Conference",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/29/technology/blockchain-iso-russian-spies.html,"Russian interest in the technology surrounding virtual currencies, like in this crypto-mining operation in Moscow, is growing. Last year, employees of Russia's spy agency attended a meeting where international standards for the so-called blockchain were discussed.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Last year, representatives of 25 countries met in Tokyo to work on setting international standards for the blockchain, the technology that was introduced by the virtual currency Bitcoin and has ignited intense interest in corporate and government circles. Some of the technologists at the meeting of the International Standards Organization were surprised when they learned that the head of the Russian delegation, Grigory Marshalko, worked for the F.S.B., the intelligence agency that is the successor to the K.G.B. They were even more surprised when they asked the F.S.B. agent why the Russians were devoting such resources to the blockchain standards. ""Look, the internet belongs to the Americans -- but blockchain will belong to us,"" he said, according to one delegate who was there. The Russian added that two other members of his country's four-person delegation to the conference also worked for the F.S.B.

Another delegate who had a separate conversation with the head of the Russian group remembers a slightly different wording: ""The internet belonged to America. The blockchain will belong to the Russians."" Both of the delegates who recounted their conversations did so on the condition of anonymity, because discussions at the International Standards Organization, or I.S.O., are supposed to be confidential. Neither the Russian organizations overseeing the delegation to the I.S.O. nor the Russian delegates responded to requests for comment.

The sentiment expressed by the Russian delegate is as clear a sign as any of the significance that some governments are assigning to the blockchain -- a technology that is now being applied to things as varied as financial trading and voting -- and the degree to which it is becoming a subject of geopolitical battles. The Russian interest in the normally wonky technical sessions has caused concern among other delegations, who worry that individual countries could push standards that would make the security of the blockchain technology vulnerable to surveillance and attack.

The I.S.O., based in Geneva, was created in 1947 to ensure that important technologies are built or measured in the same way all over the world. Over the years, it has created standards for food safety, film sensitivity and much more. Russia is not the only country sending high-powered delegations to the I.S.O. technical committee focusing on blockchain standards, which got its start last year. The 25 countries with committee delegations sent over 130 people to the last meeting to discuss matters like a common method for security. China sent officials from the finance ministry while the United States had delegates from IBM and Microsoft, according to participants. ""It is a very sought-out technology today, because it really does create the foundation for the future that is coming,"" said Gilbert Verdian, the head of the British delegation working on blockchain standards at the I.S.O. and the founder of the company Quant Network. ""To get behind it and back it now is going to put people at an advantage, either politically or economically."" The original blockchain is the shared database on which all Bitcoin transactions are recorded. It is kept by a distributed network of computers managed by many people, rather than one central authority. While there are now many virtual currencies, each with its own blockchain, there are also many government and corporate efforts looking at ways to use blockchain technology to securely record other kinds of data.

Within the young blockchain industry there is a widespread belief that the companies and countries that establish an early lead could guide the direction of the technology, for both commercial and national security purposes. Emma Channing, a lawyer who frequently works with blockchain start-ups, recently raised an alarm about the intrigue at the I.S.O. standards group. Ms. Channing said she was worried that countries that devote more resources to the process could successfully push their preferred cryptographic algorithms to be the standards, potentially creating so-called back doors that could be used in the future to spy on blockchain activity. ""In the context of software it is the perfect Trojan,"" said Ms. Channing, a co-founder of the Satis Group, an American company that advises blockchain projects. ""If something gets buried in it, these things will get adopted wholesale -- and won't be questioned on the way in."" Ms. Channing recently emailed dozens of blockchain experts, trying to get them to volunteer as representatives to the I.S.O. delegations in their countries, so that the process does not become dominated by a few countries. The chairman of the I.S.O. blockchain committee, Craig Dunn, rejected the idea that any country could shape the process. While I.S.O. proceedings are generally confidential, new standards must go through many stages, with many rounds of voting -- first with smaller working groups and then with full national delegations.

Few countries have made their interest in the blockchain as clear as Russia. President Vladimir V. Putin met briefly last year with Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum, the second most widely used blockchain-based virtual currency platform after Bitcoin.

 Mr. Putin also put the blockchain at the center of his ""Digital Economy"" program for Russia, and his government has talked about creating a crypto-ruble, similar to Bitcoin. One of the Russian delegates to the I.S.O. blockchain group, Maxim Shevchenko, gave a talk last summer in Russia in which he spoke about the country's goals in the I.S.O. group. The bullet points on the slide included ""possibility to influence the technology"" and ""implementation Russian standards and solutions worldwide."" Another member of the Russian delegation, Alexey Urivskiy, told the Russian newspaper Vedomosti last year that the delegation at the I.S.O. committee was supposed to get Russian cryptographic algorithms into the standard. The Vedomosti article said that the head of the Russian I.S.O. delegation, Mr. Marshalko, was affiliated with the F.S.B. Russia is not the only country pushing hard on the blockchain. Many Chinese government offices have been public about their interest in taking advantage of the blockchain technology for tasks like tracking people and products moving through industrial supply chains. At the I.S.O. meetings last fall in Tokyo, the Chinese government sent one of the largest delegations, with at least nine people, including representatives from the finance ministry and the Chinese central bank, according to a delegate from another country who met the Chinese participants.

The United States delegation was led at the last meeting by a Microsoft employee and included a delegate from IBM. Microsoft and IBM are two of the global companies that have pushed hardest to develop blockchain technology. At the first meeting of the I.S.O. blockchain group, the Russian delegation led a study group on security and privacy issues, which caused discomfort among some delegates from other countries, according to the two delegates who spoke to The New York Times. At a second meeting, oversight for these issues was transferred to a working group led by France. Mr. Verdian, the head of the British group, said lots of delegations were jockeying to get an edge on the new technology. ""It will change how our society can operate, but at the same time, in harnessing this technology people might want to leverage that for their own gain,"" he said. ""We all owe it to each other to do it right so that it benefits all of us rather than a few.""",Some think the technology that was introduced with Bitcoin has enormous potential.

Dance,Review: Heidi Latsky Dance at Montclair State University,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/18/arts/dance/review-heidi-latsky-dance-at-montclair-state-university.html,"MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- For the choreographer Heidi Latsky, there are no unbeautiful bodies and no bodies incapable of dancing. In what some might call disability, she finds possibility. In ""Triptych,"" which opened at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University on Thursday as part of the Peak Performances series, she unleashes some of those possibilities in three complementary dances, one for film and two for the stage.

The film, ""Soliloquy,"" is the first project commissioned by Dance for Film on Location, a new Montclair State initiative. Invited to choreograph for, and with, the camera, an uncharted medium for her, Ms. Latsky braids together images of dancing bodies, zooming out from parts to the whole, though the trajectory, drawn out over 14 minutes, is not so direct.

From enigmatic close-ups -- a hazy pair of swirling hands (or are they legs or shoulders?), a bloodshot eye, the curvature of a neck -- 10 people come into view. Presenting the full-body shots last, Ms. Latsky finally acquaints us with the fullness of each dancer's physicality.

Jen Bricker, a gymnast, has no legs; the tap dancer Evan Ruggiero has one and a half; Jillian Hollis, whom we see onstage later, has a muscular pair.","In ""Triptych,"" at Montclair State University, the choreographer Heidi Latsky shows that age, disease or lost limbs need not limit movement.",b30ee83e-89bd-5124-8786-ae7b0bf864f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/18/arts/18LATSKYSUB/18LATSKYSUB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=316c26b18dbf634dfbce5fa42ff8f69320f888f038a848b3939fb80c4b7907fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Heidi Latsky and Gregory Youdan Jr. in Ms. Latsky's ""Triptych,"" at Montclair State University's Alexander Kasser Theater.",b30ee83e-89bd-5124-8786-ae7b0bf864f6,N24News/imgs/b30ee83e-89bd-5124-8786-ae7b0bf864f6.jpg,6

For the protagonist of her book, ""Luster,"" she said, ""I didn't want her to be a pristine, neatly moral character.""Credit...Miranda Barnes for The New York Times



Raven Leilani in Brooklyn. For the protagonist of her book, ""Luster,"" she said, ""I didn't want her to be a pristine, neatly moral character.""

Raven Leilani has one of this summer's most anticipated fiction debuts, but in some ways, she is already anticipating the day the buzz dies down. That is when she plans to take some time to grieve the loss of her father, Warren, who died from Covid-19 in April. ""There's an aspect of this moment -- because of the enormity of it, you see the number of people who have died -- it feels abstract,"" she said in an interview. ""But it's not abstract at all. Every single number was a person, and one of those was my dad."" Because of their complicated relationship, her parents' separation when Leilani was in college and the forced isolation of the coronavirus pandemic, she has had to process the loss alone. That kind of solitude is not what she is used to, having grown up first in the Bronx, then a suburb of Albany, N.Y., in a family of West Indian artists who encouraged her creativity. For years, she juggled jobs and art, doing her writing at night or during work shifts. ""The going was slow and the going was private,"" Leilani said. ""There was a frenzy to that grind.""

It's a frenzy she captures in her novel, ""Luster,"" out on Tuesday. It follows Edie, a Black woman in her 20s scraping by on a publishing salary while trying to self-actualize as an artist. When Edie meets Eric, an older, married white man whose wife has agreed to an open marriage, Edie becomes entangled with them and their daughter -- an adopted Black 12-year-old named Akila -- in unexpected ways. ""I wanted to write a story about a Black woman who fails a lot and is sort of grasping for human connection and making mistakes,"" Leilani, now 29, said. ""I didn't want her to be a pristine, neatly moral character.""

Farrar, Straus and Giroux, Leilani's publisher, has named ""Luster"" its novel of August, part of a campaign this year highlighting reading ""for solace, for protection, for instruction, for survival, for music."" ""She is exactly the kind of writer that we've always published and that we've always been dedicated to publishing -- someone who is an artist and a craftsman, but also someone who is speaking to her moment and our cultural history,"" Jenna Johnson, who acquired the book for the publisher, said. Ahead of its publication, ""Luster"" has already been praised by other writers, including Carmen Maria Machado, Brit Bennett and Angela Flournoy. In an email, Zadie Smith, who taught Leilani in grad school, called ""Luster"" a ""daring, perverse, wildly funny book about how we use each other -- especially how the old use the young, socially, economically and intimately.""

Machado, the author of ""In the Dream House"" and ""Her Body and Other Parties,"" said ""Luster"" ""took me by the throat and didn't really let me go,"" particularly when it came to the way Leilani writes about sex. ""They were hot and real and also did all the things I want sex scenes to do, which is feel realistic, sometimes be sexy, sometimes be unpleasant or stressful, but allowing for both, allowing for real bodies,"" Machado said.

For Leilani, those scenes were her way to capture ""a free Black girl"" and the ""perversity"" of sexual thoughts when allowed to roam free. She also wanted to highlight a nonlinear artistic path, one that came in contact with the real world. ""You talk to other writers and they're sort of dogged by this specter of 'I'm not making anything,'"" she said, ""but for most of us, that's the reality of making art, is not making it.""

That Edie is a painter is no coincidence. As a teenager, Leilani expected that she would be a visual artist as well. She attended a high school with a strong art program, where she said she and her classmates engaged in serious critiques of their work. But when it came time to apply for college, she realized that she wasn't quite good enough to make a career out of painting. ""I still loved it a lot, and I think you can see that in a lot of my writing, but with grappling with those artistic limits, I found that it took the love out of it a little bit,"" she said. ""With writing, that's not the case. Even when it's hard, I still love it."" After graduating college in 2012, Leilani took the first job she could find, as an imaging specialist at Ancestry.com. She went on to work at a scientific journal, on a top-secret project for the Department of Defense and as a Postmates delivery person. When she moved from Washington to New York to pursue her M.F.A. at New York University in 2017, she joined Macmillan as a production associate. ""I'd write inside the HTML of the e-books, so it looked like I was making corrections,"" she said, ""but I was writing 'Luster.'"" At other jobs, she wrote on the backs of receipts or in email drafts. Leilani started writing under her first and middle name -- her surname is Baptiste -- as a way to separate her literary work from her employment.

Those years are present in much of her work. The job at the Department of Defense inspired the short story ""Hard Water."" In 2016, she found herself having trouble breathing for half a year and turned the experience into the story ""Breathing Exercise,"" published in the Yale Review. And she was adamant that work play a big role in the lives of the characters in ""Luster."" ""It was important to me,"" Leilani said, ""to have a book where characters have work, where characters have something they do and care about.""

Her early writing years involved a lot of trial and error, including a ""sexy science fiction"" novel and another that drew on her love of comic books and music. ""I felt preoccupied with the idea of an original product. I wanted it to be weird and I wanted it to be strange and I wanted it to feel new,"" she said. ""But when I was working on those projects, they felt very opaque and without purpose."" So when she got to grad school, she discarded them and thought, ""I can do better. And not just do better, but write something that I really mean."" ""Luster,"" Leilani said, ""was an experiment in speaking honestly and in committing to a distinct point of view."" Her goal in developing the character of Edie was to melt away the ""studiedness"" that people -- especially Black people -- learn as a survival mechanism in a world where they are constantly surveilled. ""I wanted Edie to take up space,"" she said. ""I wanted her to always be articulating to us, even though she's not articulating to the people in her environment, what she wanted."" In a review of the book in the Virginia Quarterly Review, the writer Kaitlyn Greenidge described Edie as a Black flaneur, one who walks through the city cataloging her surroundings, blending in as best she can with the crowd.

""She is playing with language in such an invigorating way,"" Greenidge said in an interview. ""People say that about literary novels all the time: 'oh, the language, the language, the language.' But oftentimes that ends up in inscrutable or not very exciting sentences. That is not the case with Raven. Her use of language is truly surprising."" Leilani, who often clears her head with long walks around New York City, was struck by the flaneur comparison. She credits poetry as formative to her writing. ""There's something beautiful about rhythm, about style, about pattern,"" she said. ""I think because I started with a love of poetry, the way I sort of transitioned into writing prose and novel-length stuff and short fiction is that I still felt obsessed by the part of writing that is about language."" She often obsesses over sentence-level changes and won't move on until she gets it just right. Now she writes full-time, spending most of her days seated on her bed, slowly making a dent in it while she writes until ""the sun is gone."" ""Because so much of my life has been work, has been a deferral of my dream to make anything in terms of my art,"" Leilani said, ""it feels incredible that my days right now can be about that. It feels magical.""","The novelist's debut, ""Luster,"" is winning accolades for its unfiltered depiction of sex, failure and a Black woman adrift in work and life.",3d3f1673-4049-5da7-9534-9b3975a0b485,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/28/books/28Leilani2/28Leilani2-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=165cd6f9a680a37e90bae8ce7e3e2d52021297916bb88c28ddc837d64b50a3d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Raven Leilani in Brooklyn.

Theater,"The 'Bronx Tale' Strategy: Win Suburban Love, Not Broadway Prestige",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/theater/the-bronx-tale-strategy-win-suburban-love-not-broadway-prestige.html,"Larry and Cathy Roppelt, 44 years married, made a nearly two-hour trek into Manhattan from Medford, Long Island, on a recent evening for a rare occasion: a Broadway show. They chose ""A Bronx Tale"" for one reason. ""It's our era,"" Mr. Roppelt remarked during intermission, in a gruff accent that could have fit right onstage at the doo-wop heavy musical set in the 1960s. ""This is the music that we grew up with."" ""A Bronx Tale,"" a $10 million show based on the 1993 movie, is not a musical that will win plaudits for innovation. It won't win anything at all at the Tony Awards on June 11 because it went unrecognized in the recent nominations. But in a highly competitive season that featured 13 new musicals, a show that many critics called forgettable has turned out to be much like its protagonist: a scrappy survivor. Even without a star like Bette Midler in ""Hello, Dolly!"" or the acclaim and box-office juice of a ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" the show has been a solid seller since its December opening.

""A Bronx Tale"" has been grossing, on average, more than $800,000 a week. Michael David, the show's executive producer, said it has not had a losing week, although he declined to disclose the weekly running costs. For comparison, for the week of May 15, the most recent week with available data, ""Dear Evan Hansen,"" which is up for best musical and eight other Tonys, took in $1.25 million in eight performances; ""Hello, Dolly!"" grossed $1.93 million in seven performances and is up for 10 Tonys. Alan Menken and Glenn Slater wrote the score for ""A Bronx Tale,"" which began as a loosely autobiographical one-man show written and performed by Chazz Palminteri. It tells the story of Calogero, a boy taken under the wing of a gangster named Sonny. In a neighborhood rife with racial tension, Calogero ends up caught between his loving blue-collar father and the glamorous life of a gangster. Robert De Niro made his directing debut with the movie version and played Calogero's father. The movie became an instantly quotable hit. Go to the Bronx and say out loud, ""Now, youse can't leave,"" and count the knowing nods. Right from the start, the producers of the musical aimed their message at commuters. The marketing team blanketed Penn Station with ads that prominently displayed the names of Mr. Palminteri and Mr. De Niro, who co-directed the show with Jerry Zaks. Instead of buying newspaper ads, they concentrated on radio and on television spots on, for example, News 12, a tristate channel.

He knows the formula well: He was a lead producer on ""Jersey Boys,"" another nostalgic musical, that ran 12 years before it closed in January. And while the reviews for ""A Bronx Tale"" were mixed, the positive notice in The New York Times made the link crystal clear: ""If you're already mourning the imminent closing of 'Jersey Boys,' this is the show for you,"" it read -- a line prominently displayed on advertisements. The creators of ""A Bronx Tale"" hope prospective ticket buyers will find geographic and generational familiarity a compelling reason to attend. ""Everybody says, 'That was me -- you did my story, Chazz; I grew up there,'"" Mr. Palminteri said. ""Or even if they didn't grow up there: 'You know, I saw your musical and I called my father.'"" Arlene Weinstein, 68, a former Bronx resident, came from Westchester County in New York to see the show with her two daughters. ""It was very much my life,"" she said. And you don't need to be from the title borough to get it. As one woman shouted as she left the theater, ""The bottom line is, I'm from Brooklyn and I enjoyed it."" According to Mr. David, it's patrons from the New York suburbs, New Jersey and Connecticut who make shows into long-running hits. ""They're the people who go once or twice for a special anniversary or celebration,'' he said. ""They're not the mavens. They're not folks who can afford to go all the time. They have to pick carefully because it's an expensive investment.""","The musical received no Tony nominations. But nostalgia and smart marketing are filling the seats with the ""Jersey Boys"" demographic.",ae828742-36b2-557c-bb64-604ed211df43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/30/arts/30BRONXTALE/30BRONXTALE-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=33590a7abf5aa48bac8ee0dd0fc58558dcd25a83f0ea3cb25fcdd0c437183b7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nick Cordero, left, as Sonny and Hudson Loverro as the young Calogero in the musical ""A Bronx Tale,"" at the Longacre Theater.",ae828742-36b2-557c-bb64-604ed211df43,N24News/imgs/ae828742-36b2-557c-bb64-604ed211df43.jpg,10

It wrings laughs by mixing excess with righteous language, centering on Eli Gemstone (Goodman) and his children -- Jesse (McBride), Judy (Edi Patterson) and Kelvin (Adam DeVine) -- who are experts in turning the word of God into cash. They're also extremely dysfunctional and comically selfish, casually using their faith as justification for misdeeds.

Dance,A Too-Rare Chance to See City Ballet's Current Stars Dance on Television,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/20/arts/dance/city-ballets-stars-dance-on-television-wnet.html,"Ballet was once considered such a natural fit for television that CBS's first color broadcast in 1951 featured New York City Ballet dancers performing George Balanchine's ""La Valse."" But the changing media landscape has made televised ballet rare in America, and left City Ballet's current stars with few chances to preserve their performances for the small screen.

So it is noteworthy that City Ballet will get two nights on public television this winter.

The final performance of the company's three-week engagement last summer in the Theatre du Chatelet in Paris will be broadcast over two consecutive Friday nights in February as part of the Great Performances series. The program, which WNET announced on Tuesday, is set to air on Feb. 17 and Feb. 24 at 9 p.m., though viewers should check local listings. It will showcase City Ballet performing several Balanchine works set to the music of French composers.

For fans of American ballet, it will be a welcome opportunity to see a broadcast of one of their premiere companies at a time when the Bolshoi Ballet in Moscow and the Royal Ballet in London have dominated the market in simulcasting dance performances to cinemas around the world. The programs were made possible in large part because of French interest in City Ballet: They were produced for Bel Air Media by Francois Duplat and directed by Vincent Bataillon.

So which dancers will be seen? Sara Mearns, Adrian Danchig-Waring and Lauren Lovette will be featured in ""Walpurgisnacht Ballet,"" which is set to music by Gounod; Megan Fairchild and Joaquin De Luz will dance ""Sonatine,"" a pas de deux set to Ravel; and Tiler Peck, Andrew Veyette, Teresa Reichlen, Tyler Angle, Alston Macgill, Anthony Huxley, Brittany Pollack and Taylor Stanley will be among the 50 dancers in Bizet's ""Symphony in C.""",Public TV's Great Performances series will feature City Ballet in several works set to the music of French composers this winter.,671323ce-708c-5279-9c86-b39ce002384a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/21/arts/21TVBALLET-ITEM/21TVBALLET-ITEM-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=66e417e1b4821a53285ee40d04fe247b41a6552540611e79e1d37c045d58d84e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sterling Hyltin and Jared Angle at at Théâtre du Châtelet in Balanchine's ""La Valse,"" which will be aired as part of the Great Performances series this winter.",671323ce-708c-5279-9c86-b39ce002384a,N24News/imgs/671323ce-708c-5279-9c86-b39ce002384a.jpg,6
Technology,"A Chat With a Live Streamer Is Yours, for a Price",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/12/technology/personaltech/paying-for-live-stream-chat.html,"Andre Rebelo, a 24-year-old YouTube streamer from Vancouver, British Columbia, live-streamed himself playing the game Grand Theft Auto V on his YouTube channel, Typical Gamer, in mid-January. This time, he added something different for his audience. As Mr. Rebelo broadcast his gameplay, he used a new YouTube feature called Super Chat to invite his more than 4.5 million subscribers to send him comments. For those viewers willing to pay him a sum of their choice -- from $1 to $500 -- Mr. Rebelo would more prominently feature their comments. One viewer quickly wrote, ""Hey you, your videos are so cool I love you,"" and offered Mr. Rebelo $10 through Super Chat. Another wrote, ""What's up TG, watching live from the NYC,"" and gave $5. Someone even donated the largest amount possible, $500.

Super Chat is one of the newest ways that streamers can make money. To date, the primary way creators earn money on YouTube has been through subscriptions and advertising. Eligible streamers can enable ad options on their channels, leading to several types of ads appearing next to their videos; creators then earn a share of the revenue. But as live video continues to grow in popularity on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, dedicated video streaming platforms like YouTube and Twitch, the Amazon-owned live-streaming platform that focuses on video games, are looking for new ways to sweeten the deal for streamers to encourage them to produce more live video content. YouTube began a test of Super Chat on Jan. 12 and followed with a wide rollout of the feature on Feb. 7. Now any YouTube streamer with more than 1,000 subscribers who is registered with YouTube's Partner Program -- which allows users to earn money from videos through advertising -- can enable Super Chat during a live stream. Once Super Chat is turned on, viewers can pay $1 to $500 to have their comment highlighted. The more they pay, the more characters a comment can contain, and the longer it will remain ""pinned"" to the live-stream window, making it more visible. So while a $5 Super Chat message can contain a maximum of 150 characters and stays highlighted for two minutes, a $500 Super Chat message can have 350 characters and is highlighted for five hours.

""For creators, Super Chat does double duty: keeping their conversations and connections with (super) fans meaningful and lively while also giving them a new way to make money,"" said Barbara Macdonald, a product manager at YouTube who worked on Super Chat. Twitch has a feature similar to Super Chat called Cheering, begun in June 2016, which lets viewers ""tip"" streamers during a live stream. Viewers ""cheer"" by using ""Bits,"" virtual goods that come in the form of animated gem-shaped emoticons. Viewers can buy Bits directly from the chat window; there are different colors and sizes starting at $1.40 for 100 Bits. Streamers receive one cent for every Bit used in their chat. ""Twitch viewers are very savvy and in tune with their favorite casters, so they are aware that their support is what enables their favorite streamers to broadcast full time,"" said Matt McCloskey, the vice president for commerce at Twitch. Super Chat and Cheering are more than about money -- they also offer another way for streamers and their audiences to bond and converse. T. L. Taylor, a professor of comparative media studies at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said real-time interaction with audiences in live streaming -- particularly in the genre of video game live streaming -- was increasingly becoming a crucial part of the experience.

""Game live-streaming taps into the longstanding pleasure of spectating other people's play,"" Dr. Taylor said. ""Live streamers are adept at connecting with the folks watching them, drawing them out and into the play experience."" YouTube and Twitch have experimented with other ways to profit from content in the past, including subscription services and merchandising. YouTube introduced its subscription service, YouTube Red, in late 2015, in which members pay a recurring fee to watch their favorite channels without ads.

On Twitch, while all channels are free, subscribing to a channel gives viewers perks like subscriber-only chat, subscriber-only emoticons and discounts on merchandise. Subscriptions on Twitch are generally around $4.99 a month. But features like Super Chat and Cheering feel more personal. ""Some people just like to let me know that my videos make their day, what video is their favorite, suggestions for future live streams and over all just to increase the odds of their comments being seen and for me to say their name,"" Mr. Rebelo said. There may be a downside to the new features, said Michael Pachter, a Wedbush Securities analyst. He said it was hard to predict how audiences would react once they were asked to pay for interactions with live streamers. ""Super Chat is probably destined to fail,"" Mr. Pachter said. ""I think that the business model is flawed, and I think the ability to 'buy' a spot in the queue is going to turn off a lot of fans."" A YouTube spokeswoman said there had already been ""hundreds of thousands"" of Super Chat purchases since the product launched. ""While anyone could make predictions, we've been really encouraged by the early adoption and engagement on Super Chat,"" the spokeswoman said. Yet some internet commentators are not impressed.

Economy,An Economic Upturn Begun Under Obama Is Now Trump's to Tout,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/business/economy/trump-economy-credit.html,"By nearly every standard measure, the American economy is doing well -- and better than it was a year and a half ago, before Donald J. Trump was elected president. If only the debate over who deserves most of the credit were as easily judged. Americans' perceptions of the economy's prospects increasingly depend more on their political identity than statistics on output or stock markets. So each new economic report -- whether the latest monthly jobs figures or the quarterly growth estimate -- reignites the feud between Trump supporters and critics. The same gauges that illustrate this administration's economic successes also make clear that they are built on the achievements of the previous one, and that the economy is following the upward trajectory begun under President Barack Obama. In the 18 months before Mr. Trump moved into the White House, 3.7 million jobs were created, seven in 10 Americans said they were doing fine or living comfortably and the economy grew. In the 18 months since, 3.4 million jobs were created, seven in 10 Americans said they were doing fine or living comfortably and the economy grew. Stubbornly slow wage growth and wide income gaps have spanned both periods.

Economists are quick to point out that presidents of both parties are assigned more credit or blame than they deserve for the economy, a colossus whose course is fashioned, bit by bit, from innumerable decisions made every day by investors, consumers, managers and merchants around the globe. Even so, Mr. Trump -- through a combination of skill and circumstance -- has been better able than his predecessor to spotlight the economy's gains, political scientists say. And his message never varies, no matter what the numbers show: an economy that was ruinous under Mr. Obama is ""amazing"" under his own leadership. The salesmanship seems to have had an impact. Business and consumer sentiment are higher than before the election, and the share of the public that says the economy is improving has grown, according to Gallup surveys. At the same time, however, both presidents have had trouble transforming their economic successes into more general support. For presidents as far back as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mr. Obama is the only one whose approval ratings fell as consumer sentiment rose, said Lynn Vavreck, a professor of political science and communication at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a co-author with John Sides and Michael Tesler of a coming book on the 2016 presidential campaign.

What Mr. Trump has been particularly well positioned to do, though, is identify himself with economic success. He made his name as a celebrity tycoon. ""It dovetails with a narrative about Donald Trump that has existed for a long time: that he's a businessman, that he understands the working of the economy, that he knows how to make money,"" said Mark Rozell, dean of the Schar School of Policy and Government of George Mason University in Virginia. Mr. Obama's background was in community organizing and the public sector. ""No one expects such a person to have any feel for creating good economic conditions,"" Mr. Rozell said. ""He is more likely to be seen as riding an economic wave or trend, whereas the businessman is seen as responsible."" Circumstances have also provided Mr. Trump with a tailwind. He has benefited from an additional year and a half of economic growth, which compounds the perception of the economy as resilient. The nine-year expansion has endured in the face of disruptions -- from a global slowdown to trade tensions and unpredictable policy pronouncements. Even if individuals are unaware of most details, the high confidence scores reflect the collective evidence and evaluations that the economy is hardy, said Tyler Cowen, an economist at George Mason University. ""Markets aggregate information,"" he said.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The extended recovery is naturally digging deeper. The Labor Department reported that joblessness fell to 3.9 percent in July, near the 18-year low it reached in May. The least educated workers -- who have received the smallest share of the recovery's rewards -- were hired in greater numbers, while traditional industrial sectors like manufacturing that have suffered from decades of losses, added jobs. Steep corporate tax cuts have raised longer-term worries about bloated deficits, and an anti-regulatory stance troubles watchdogs who warn that health and safety risks will increase. But in the short term, those actions have temporarily quickened the pace of growth, pumped money into the economy and buoyed business confidence.

That exuberance has included claims by the president that sometimes go beyond the economic facts in portraying a turnaround on his watch. But the net effect has been to outshine the economy's weak spots, like sluggish wage growth, income inequality and the erosion of middle-class jobs -- factors that contributed to Mr. Trump's election and still exist. The Democrats were less adept at rounding up credit for economic improvements and shaking off criticisms. ""Part of Obama's problem, especially in the last year, was that he was too understated,"" said Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics. ""In every instance, he downplayed it. It was 'Just the facts, ma'am.' That doesn't work anymore."" A widening political gap hovers over all these developments. Views of the economy have always been shaped by concrete conditions as well as party affiliation, said Jonathan Rothwell, senior economist at Gallup, the analytics and consulting firm.

Many of these households turned to Mr. Trump in 2016, and continue to express faith in his ability to better their economic fortunes. Ms. Vavreck of U.C.L.A. argues that differences around race and ethnicity issues have amplified the partisan divide as views on immigration and diversity increasingly fall along party lines. This has spilled over into appraisals of the economy. That could be part of the reason for the unusual disconnect between favorable economic news and approval ratings for both Mr. Obama and Mr. Trump. Historically, sentiments about the economy could build up or chip away at a president's support, Ms. Vavreck said, but no longer. ""In a polarized age,"" she said, ""Americans may give little credit to a president not of their own party.""",Both presidents have had trouble turning better times into higher approval ratings.

Science,"When a Pregnant Pipefish Dad Spots an Alluring Female, Things Get Weird",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/science/pipefish-abort-pregnancies.html,"Pipefish, along with their cousins sea horses and sea dragons, defy convention in love and fertility. In a striking role reversal, fathers give birth instead of mothers. During courtship, females pursue males with flashy ornaments or elaborate dances, and males tend to be choosy about which females' eggs they'll accept. Once pregnant, these gender-bending fathers invest heavily in their young, supplying embryos with nutrients and oxygen through a setup similar to the mammalian placenta. But this investment may also be cruelly conditional, according to a new study in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Studying pipefish, scientists found evidence that pregnant fathers spontaneously abort or divert fewer resources to their embryos when faced with the prospects of a superior mate -- in this case, an exceptionally large female. The researchers named their finding the ""woman in red"" effect, after the eponymous 1984 Gene Wilder film about a married man's obsession with a woman in a red dress that becomes damaging to his family life.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The reported effect is an interesting instance of sexual conflict, which is ubiquitous among animals, said Sarah Flanagan, a pipefish expert at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand. If you're a romantic, you might think of mating as harmonious. But in nature, reproduction is more often a vicious power struggle between mothers and fathers with competing interests. A maternal analogue to the ""woman in red"" effect occurs among mice. Males are willing to kill a female's offspring, if they are unrelated to him, before mating with her. In anticipation, a pregnant mother may terminate her pregnancy when exposed to a new male, rather than spending resources on doomed offspring.

This behavior, named the Bruce effect (for Hilda Bruce, the British zoologist), has been documented in lions, horses and monkeys, too, but a similar strategy has never been reported apart from mammals until now, said Nuno Monteiro, a researcher at the CIBIO Research Center in Biodiversity and Genetic Resources in Portugal and an author of the new study.

Though pipefish don't commit infanticide, Dr. Monteiro wondered whether they experienced something similar to the Bruce effect because pregnancies are so costly for males. Previous research had found that pipefish fathers invest less in pregnancies from small females if they have bred with larger females before. At the risk of anthropomorphizing, Dr. Flanagan said, it's as if male pipefish are thinking, ""I've done better in the past."" In their study, Dr. Monteiro and his collaborators bred male black-striped pipefish with large females, then kept each father-to-be in a tank partitioned from a new female of equal size, a new female much larger in size (the woman in red), or its original mate. Males in the ""woman in red"" group -- exposed to the new, ""sexier"" female -- had the highest rates of abortion and shortest pregnancies. They also birthed smaller offspring, some of which had abnormalities. It seems that these fathers stopped investing in existing offspring to save up for a better brood, said Jacinta Beehner, an associate professor of psychology and anthropology at the University of Michigan who studies reproductive strategies in primates. In fact, because pipefish fathers are known to absorb nutrients from aborted embryos (essentially cannibalizing their young), they should be able to reallocate energy from abandoned pregnancies toward future ones, Dr. Monteiro said.",This is not a happy love story.,544dda13-cb0c-5ce0-8ace-4758f6901600,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/28/science/25TB-PIPEFISH1/25TB-PIPEFISH1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=37ecf663a79e5ee972ce17a813695eec584efc9a3c02bafb5c59e540e253c540&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A robust ghost pipefish in waters off Indonesia.

Real Estate,Alarm Over Istanbul's Building Boom,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/21/realestate/commercial/after-istanbuls-building-boom-come-worries-of-a-bust.html,"ISTANBUL -- ""We are invading Istanbul again,"" the real estate agent said enthusiastically as she ticked off the selling points of Turkey's most ambitious development extravaganza to date: Maslak 1453. Named for the year this bicontinental city passed from Christian to Muslim hands, Maslak 1453 has been planned as a vast complex of 24 towers, shopping malls galore and, not least, a 1,453-meter-long (4,767-foot) shopping promenade that celebrates the most consequential date in Turkish history. Upon completion in 2015, it will be the largest real estate development in all of Europe and perhaps the ultimate expression of the pell-mell construction boom that has underpinned Turkey's decade of rapid growth under Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the nation's Islamist prime minister. Mr. Erdogan's timing was perfect, coinciding with the global liquidity glut unleashed by the world's leading central banks to restore growth in the advanced industrial economies after the Great Recession. One result was a sharp increase in lending by Turkish banks, much of it directed toward property developers.

But as Turkish interest rates spike and the economy slows, local bankers and real estate experts are becoming increasingly worried that Istanbul's real estate market may be heading for a fall. And they are reminded of similarities between the situation here and what happened in Spain and Ireland, where alliances among banks, developers and politicians contributed to the creation of real estate bubbles that popped once interest rates began to rise, puncturing the overall economies as well. ""The official numbers are showing signs of risk,"" said Hakan Eren, a real estate investment adviser. ""The result could be a bust if this is not well managed."" According to research by Mustafa Sonmez, author of numerous books on the Turkish economy, Mr. Erdogan has favored the construction and real estate sectors at the expense of important export sectors. ""It's a shame,"" said Mr. Sonmez, who calculates that construction spending is now about 9 percent of the overall economy, a level that the International Monetary Fund has found to be associated with problems in other countries. ""We have used all this free money to build houses and feed the domestic market.""

To date, the local market had been remarkably resilient, overcoming a global rise in interest rates caused by last year's ""taper tantrum"" surrounding the Federal Reserve's decision to begin cutting back on stimulus, and the anti-government, anti-development street protests at Taksim Square here in Istanbul. But in the first three months of the year, unit sales for new apartments were down about 60 percent compared to the same period last year, according to Emlak Konut, the country's largest real estate investment company. Maslak 1453, named for the year the Ottomans took over Istanbul, is planned as a complex of 24 towers. Completion is scheduled for next year. Tara Todras-Whitehill for The New York Times Moreover, Mr. Eren said, the inventory of unsold housing units has risen to 1.5 million, compared to levels close to zero several years ago, a clear sign that the slowing economy and higher interest rates are cutting into demand. The potential for a real estate crash highlights the role of the relatively obscure Housing Development Administration, commonly known as Toki, in fueling the boom. Traditionally a bureaucratic backwater with a mandate to push for more affordable homes, Toki emerged as a housing power center when its bylaws were changed in January 2004 to bring it under the direct control of Mr. Erdogan less than a year after he was elected. Under his sponsorship, Toki amassed choice properties at little or no cost, auctioned them off to developers and took a cut of the profits. According to Mr. Sonmez, Toki has been particularly aggressive in backing high-end projects undertaken by developers with ties to Mr. Erdogan. They include Ali Agaoglu, the billionaire businessman behind Maslak 1453, who late last year was one of a number of business executives, bankers and politicians questioned by the police as part of a broad corruption investigation. Also questioned were two Toki board members.

""The rise of Erdogan and the construction industry in Turkey have been one and the same,"" Mr. Sonmez said. In light of Istanbul's extraordinary growth spurt over the last decade, of course, a metamorphosis of the city's skyline was to be expected, and many of Istanbul's new development projects have been financially successful. But some of the more recent, highly ambitious real estate schemes are proving more problematic. One of the most closely watched is the Mall of Istanbul, a grandiose experiment conceived by a business magnate, Aziz Torun, who in the early 1970s was a friend and classmate of Mr. Erdogan at a religious vocational school in Istanbul. It has soaring towers, a cavernous mall and even an indoor amusement park with roller coasters. And until Maslak 1453 opens for business, the Mall of Istanbul holds the distinction of being Turkey's largest mixed-use development. Real estate experts point out, however, that these types of big projects are likely to suffer from the economy's increasing volatility. This past January, the day after the Turkish central bank made a drastic move to prop up the lira by doubling interest rates, Mr. Torun did his best to address these concerns. He promised that the Mall of Istanbul would open in April -- although the grand opening is now set for June, with Mr. Erdogan expected to attend -- and said his company had ""stuck out our neck"" by striking rental agreements with prospective retailers, which track the value of the dollar, at a favorable exchange rate. During a visit late last month, a sales agent was quick to catalog the Mall of Istanbul's attractions: easy parking, proximity to the airport and, of course, the on-site amusement park. But will wealthy foreigners or aspiring Turkish professionals snap up pricey apartments or flock to yet another opulent shopping mall? Especially one located in an industrial park at the intersection of two major highways more than 10 miles outside central Istanbul? ""All this is problematic,"" he said, citing the project's location. ""The Mall of Istanbul could be the Titanic of shopping malls in Turkey.""","Real estate development in the Turkish city, fueled by cheap money and official encouragement, reminds some of what happened in Spain and Ireland.",4f0ac335-c073-5038-a95c-d7d80480a3fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/21/business/TURK/TURK-articleLarge-v3.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=cfaa4b5fca8aa0651e4d0914f14bf9257d68ee56cf93573c55c01f899b75eecf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The amusement park being built at the Mall of Istanbul.

Opinion,I Need You to Care That Our Country Is on Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/opinion/california-fires.html,"If you've never experienced a fire season before, it's hard to explain the emotional, physical and sensory effects of having the world immolate before your eyes. I spent decades with only a passing knowledge of wildfires. I'd read about smoke jumpers and fire seasons, sure. I'd seen the news videos of planes and helicopters dumping water on burning hillsides. I have distinct memories of images of the California countryside at night with a raging fire threatening a neighborhood development and reports of evacuations and deaths. It seemed awful and cruel and arbitrary -- but also like something happening in a distant part of the world. I empathized, but I didn't understand. Then I moved West. I arrived in my new home in Montana in 2017 only 10 days before a July thunderstorm tore through the Bitterroot Valley and ignited a fire that burned for two months and devastated 53,902 acres of land 20 miles from my home. If you're lucky, it comes on slowly. You awake one morning and you notice the smell. For me, it was the distinct smell of a campfire having just been extinguished. It's an uncanny sensation that doesn't fade. The air is hazy; the blue sky fades to a cloudy white in the direction of the fire. Before long, the smell and the haze increase. For me, a dull headache begins alongside a tickle in the back of my throat, similar to the way I feel when spring allergies begin.

If the fire isn't contained, every hour gets worse from there, and the world takes on an apocalyptic quality. That first Montana summer, I remember sitting in the bleachers of Missoula's minor league baseball stadium. At the beer stand, I gazed out across the valley to see an unmoving column of smoke shaped like the funnel of a tornado thousands of feet high. Its plume widened until it mingled with the clouds above, forming an oppressive ashy dome over my town. Behind it the sun set, drawing out otherworldly reds and yellows. It felt like living on an uninhabitable planet. They never told me that the sunsets at the end of the world would be so striking. Then even those colors fade. You wake up in darkness and you're left with soot -- in the sky, on your car, your windows, your driveway, your trees, your lawn. Eventually, those allergy feelings turn into a deeper malaise, which is fed by the sepia skies that resemble nuclear winter.

This is what happens if you're one of the lucky ones who are affected only by the byproduct of those raging fires. I consider myself fortunate to have never seen one from less than a dozen or so miles away. But for those who encounter them -- or have to live in their proximity, and grapple with the long-term health ramifications -- it is hell on earth. The climate, and the world, are changing. What challenges will the future bring, and how should we respond to them?

In Sept. 2020, Michael Benson studied detailed satellite imagery. Here's the earth that he saw -- and the one he wants to see. At a biometrics conference in 2019, I listened to a Department of Homeland Security official give a presentation on the Camp Fire in Paradise, Calif., which was fueled by nearly 90-mile-an-hour wind gusts. He was there to talk about the use of cutting-edge technology to identify the charred remains of some of the fire's more than 80 victims. The presenter's anecdotes included the story of one couple who awoke in the night because their Amazon Alexa smart speaker was chirping that it had been disconnected. When they came to, they saw two-thirds of their house ablaze. They managed to escape; their pets and possessions did not. Since I moved West, I've been preoccupied with this question: Would Americans feel a greater sense of alarm about our rapidly warming planet and the disastrous, perhaps irreversible effects of climate change if everyone could experience a fire season in person? Would cable news hosts devote the same nonstop coverage to fires as they do for hurricanes if more of their executives woke up each morning to falling ash? Would more lawmakers care if it looked like this outside the Capitol at high noon?

The American West does not have a monopoly on climate-related disasters. Hurricane seasons grow worse each year and devastating earthquakes loom. The flooding in the Midwest and storms like the recent derecho in Iowa are calamities that deserve equal attention. They're also urgent alarm bells. Everyone on earth right now is experiencing unpredictable and dire weather. No region is alone in experiencing the tragedy of our dying planet. I'm not so naive as to think that all Americans would, say, support a Green New Deal if they had to confront a California fire season head-on -- that's not even the case for California residents! But there is a surrealness to these wildfires and their profound impact that remains difficult to explain to anyone who hasn't experienced them. Unlike a storm that makes landfall and barrels through, leaving destruction in its path, the encroaching infernos descend for days, weeks, even months, and become part of our lives. It feels both like the end of days and like the new normal -- a stultifying Instagram filter fitted over our eyes at all times.

The point of this column isn't to guilt people for where they live or what they've experienced, but to convey the desperation that so many Americans are feeling right now. It's an anxiety that deepens each year. One that turns cloudless summer days in July into harbingers of misery. It's a psychological toll, as much as it is physical. One that, while you're living through it, renders it difficult to see a healthy future for the earth through all the smoke.",Would you feel more urgency about climate change if all you could see was smoke?,a27967e9-0292-5d56-95d9-8fb00add986a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/09/opinion/09warzelWeb/09warzelWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6c88924af89d370465fc192e7a897e4661b22b8baf1f0c74b567e75410681da5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A view of the Bear Fire in Oroville, Calif., on Wednesday.",a27967e9-0292-5d56-95d9-8fb00add986a,N24News/imgs/a27967e9-0292-5d56-95d9-8fb00add986a.jpg,11
Travel,"36 Hours in Kobe, Japan",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/travel/what-to-do-in-kobe-japan.html,"In 1868, after more than two centuries of isolationism, the opening of the port of Kobe brought a wave of international influences to this sunny city on the main Japanese island of Honshu. These days visitors will find Western-style mansions built by foreign diplomats, music influenced by the United States, and dim sum in the city's Chinatown district. But the main attractions remain rooted in the region. Kobe is the western neighbor of more well-trafficked tourist destinations -- Kyoto is less than a half-hour away on the Shinkansen bullet train; Osaka is just 15 minutes. Although the city is best known for its beef, those who linger in this welcoming, walkable metropolis will also discover a singular music scene, memorable museums, eclectic shopping, little-known regional specialties and an easygoing atmosphere tinged with the foreign flavors that continue to flow through the city's glittering harbor.

Don't let the name of the Takenaka Carpentry Tools Museum fool you -- even those who can't tell a Phillips Head from a Torx will be riveted by the exhibits presented inside this beautiful museum, just steps from Shin-Kobe station. A superb iPod audio guide (free) narrates the history, traditions, artistry and craftsmanship of Japanese architecture and woodworking, so allow a couple of hours to explore everything from the ceremonial duties of a master carpenter and the joint beams of centuries-old temples to the harmonious beauty of intricate kumiko zaiku wood latticework. Admission, 500 Japanese yen, or about $4.50. Exit Shin-Kobe station and you'll face an urban milieu, but right behind the station, nature takes over. Curl north around the station, which abuts forested foothills, and follow the steep, shady path into the woods where, after about a half-mile, you'll reach Nunobiki Falls, a series of majestic cascading waterfalls well worth the sweaty ascent.

Brush up on your Japanese before sidling up to the counter at Rakuzake, a cheerful standing bar that opened last April in a downtown shopping arcade. This local hangout, with blonde-wood counters and colorful flower arrangements, serves small plates to be paired with drinks, namely nihonshu (sake). Order a glass and several dishes -- thick slices of salmon and tuna sashimi, maybe some chilled tofu, plus a plate of piping-hot fried octopus. On the second round, don't miss the standout karaage (fried chicken), served with fresh cabbage and a dollop of Kewpie mayo. Dinner for two, about 3,000 yen.

Thanks to foreign influences, Kobe has long had an ear for jazz -- local lore claims that the first Japanese jazz band was formed here in 1923. The city hosts an annual jazz festival and nightly live shows are staged in hushed clubs around town, including the atmospheric Sone. For a taste of the music scene without the hefty admission fee, descend a flight of stairs to Jam Jam. A coffee shop by day and a jazz cafe by night, this welcoming music den has a vast vinyl library of new wave and classic jazz from around the world, plus a great selection of Japanese whiskies, and separate seating for conversation (near the bar) and for listening (facing the speakers).

If there's time to visit only one art museum in Kobe, skip the Tadao Ando-designed Hyogo Prefectural Museum of Art in favor of its quirkier cousin: the Yokoo Tadanori Museum of Contemporary Art. Opened in 2012, this museum showcases the wide-ranging works of Yokoo Tadanori, a graphic designer-turned-painter and Hyogo Prefecture native. In addition to psychedelic Warholian silk-screens from the 1960s, for which Tadanori is best known, the galleries also exhibit his more recent paintings, including a current series of works painted in public spaces (through May 6). Admission, 700 yen.

Gyoza are typically served with a thin soy-and-vinegar sauce, sometimes spiked with chili oil, but in Kobe, the preferred dipping condiment for these sizzling pan-fried dumplings is an umami-rich miso sauce. Stop for a snack at Hyotan, a gyoza specialist since the 1950s with eight seats along a cramped counter (look for the red curtain-like noren ). Once you've shoehorned yourself onto a stool, ordering is easy: The only thing on the menu is gyoza, seven per order (390 yen). In addition to pots of miso sauce, there are also bottles of garlic oil, vinegar, soy sauce and chili oil on the counter for a mix-your-own condiment adventure. Underneath the train tracks between Motomachi and Kobe stations stretches a peculiar shopping arcade where you can unearth great vintage vinyl and the missing controller to your childhood Nintendo. Stroll through Motoko Town, as the aging arcade is called, to poke around bric-a-brac shops filled floor-to-ceiling with 20th-century computers, for example, or kitschy belt buckles, or, somewhat disturbingly, military uniforms from the United States and Germany. You'll also pass excellent vintage shops and record stores, small art galleries, a working silversmith and a local designer's screen-print T-shirt stall. Near Kobe Station, the arcade devolves into a ghost town, with only the occasional open stall peddling 20th-century, Showa-era toys and boxes of old remote controls; better to start at Motomachi and walk southwest.

Kobe beef is what many come here for, and you can find it served a variety of ways throughout the city, at street food stalls and specialty restaurants like Ishidaya. But if you prefer lighter fare, head to Hanare, an intimate eight-seat hideaway specializing in sumibiyaki, or cooking over charcoal. Start with sake and sashimi; in lieu of an English menu, the chef will pull out the day's fish for you to choose. For adventurous diners, this is the place to try torisashi, chicken sashimi. Add to that a few skewers of yakitori -- momo (thigh), hatsu (heart), kawa (skin) -- and the house specialty: a beautifully arranged garden of charcoal-roasted vegetables. Dinner for two, about 9,000 yen.

Glide high above the treetops aboard the Shin-Kobe Ropeway, a gondola that whisks passengers up a steep mountain slope to an observation deck with expansive views of the urban sprawl (1,500 yen round-trip). After admiring the panorama, which on clear days extends to the Seto Inland Sea, you can head deeper into the forest on a mountain hike or wander leisurely downhill through the Nunobiki Herb Gardens, where seasonal flora ranges from tulips and nasturtium in spring to summer sunflowers and lilies to the fiery leaves of autumn. On a quiet lane behind Ikuta Shrine, stop at Beyond Coffee Roasters, an excellent micro-roastery in a tiny house with a new stand-alone coffee shop across the street. Opened last year, the cute little shop, with a herringbone-wood counter and paint-smeared walls, is standing room only, so if it's busy, take an espresso with tonic water to go. Otherwise, wait patiently for a pour-over, which might be prepared by Bunn, the mustachioed roaster whose signature handlebar inspired the shop's logo. On January 17, 1995 at 5:46 a.m., Kobe and the surrounding area were devastated by a massive earthquake that left more than 6,000 dead and nearly a quarter of a million homes destroyed. To understand the trauma overcome by this city, visit the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake Memorial, a moving museum dedicated to preserving the memories of this disaster, and educating the public on how to prepare for and act if faced with a future natural threat. Despite the potentially frightening subject matter, this engaging, educational museum is routinely packed with local schoolchildren. However, those with vertigo or acute natural-disaster anxiety may prefer to skip the introductory exhibit: a powerful earthquake re-enactment involving shaking video and booming surround sound. Admission, 600 yen. Steps from Motomachi station, the Candeo Hotels Kobe Tor Road opened last year with 159 minimalist guest rooms, a sauna and public bath, lovely mountain views from the lobby and a breakfast buffet offering Western and Japanese options (3-8-8 Sannomiya-cho, Chuo-ku; candeohotels.com/kobe-torroad; from about 10,000 yen). Overlooking the harbor, the Hotel Okura Kobe is the city's landmark property, situated in a waterfront skyscraper with an elegant lobby, welcoming staff, several restaurants, and 475 spacious guest rooms, many with nighttime views across the twinkling port (2-1 Hatoba-cho, Chuo-ku; kobe.hotelokura.co.jp/en; from about 10,500 yen).","There's more to this sunny port city than beef.

Books,How a Small-Town Newspaper Editor Won a Pulitzer Prize,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/books/review/art-cullen-storm-lake.html,"This book, though, feels rushed. Too much of ""Storm Lake"" consists of broadsides, suppositional reporting and thinly drawn character sketches. Cullen has an unfortunate tendency toward armchair editorializing rather than grounded reporting. At one point, he asks, ""If you're a white male living in Storm Lake, what gives with the angry routine?"" A few pages later, he walks into a bar and grill in nearby Rockwell City. ""I rolled through the door and got the hairy eyeball from a guy my age in a crew cut and T-shirt,"" he writes. He then goes on to imagine what this gentleman must be thinking: ""He thinks people have been looking down at him since junior high school."" Cullen imagines that the man worries his taxes will go up because of the influx of immigrants; that black men could be going to college tuition-free but riot in the streets instead; and that his future is slipping away. ""I could attempt to understand him,"" Cullen muses. ""Or I could just eat my cheeseburger."" He chooses the cheeseburger. I wanted to shout: You're a journalist! Talk to him!

I share Cullen's disdain for the odious Steve King, the Iowa congressman whose history of promoting white nationalist views recently drew a rebuke from the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee and who happens to hail from Storm Lake, which has a population of 10,000. Yet when Cullen encounters King at a political gathering, he misses the chance to ask hard questions, writing, ""I approached King after he locked up the convention and asked for a happy quote."" I've been a journalist for 40 years and have never heard of a reporter making such a request. I'm not even sure what a ""happy quote"" is.

While Cullen's writing is impassioned, a plea for the rest of us not to dismiss places like Storm Lake, the prose too often feels careless and imprecise. At one point he writes of the children born to immigrants in town: ""They are babies born to people who weren't babies born here themselves."" Such foggy prose doesn't serve Cullen well.

I don't mean to sound cranky, but this book feels like a missed opportunity. Cullen and his brother are heroic figures, especially at a time when local journalism stands on such wobbly legs. Moreover, they live in a place that speaks to the dramatic changes in this country: Immigrants have settled in Storm Lake to take low-paying jobs at the local meatpacking plants (Cullen vigorously defends their right to be there), and white men and women who are rabid Trump supporters seem to vote against their own interests. The mayor of a nearby town refuses to speak to the paper because, he claims, it publishes ""fake news."" I wanted to cherish this book, to feel I could pass it on to young aspiring reporters, to get them to consider working at papers like The Storm Lake Times.","In ""Storm Lake,"" Art Cullen relates how he took on agricultural polluters and a complicit local government in rural Iowa — and why he became a newspaperman in the first place.",e3132632-4c3c-590e-8458-5d665c8b457f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/books/review/18Kotlowitz2/18Kotlowitz2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d4add5b7e4a75c561761ee9bd15aa07dc21fc59be8f303e5b7e7cf1c54e660ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An issue of The Storm Lake Times from June 2017.,e3132632-4c3c-590e-8458-5d665c8b457f,N24News/imgs/e3132632-4c3c-590e-8458-5d665c8b457f.jpg,13
Dance,Threaded Through With Menace,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/arts/dance/roseanne-spradlins-g-h-o-s-t-c-r-o-w-n-working-title-.html,"From its title forward, RoseAnne Spradlin's ""g-h-o-s-t c-r-o-w-n (working title)"" is extravagantly enigmatic. In one section, two dancers turn and leap like ballet bacchantes. In another, five dancers endure grueling variations on kicking and pivoting for 18 minutes. A Chinese silent film from 1931 is screened in fast forward. Bands of light arranged like hexagrams from the I Ching slice up the performers before they strip naked as newborns. A large metal sculpture looms onstage, an onion-like orb of concentric rings; when it rotates, its whirlpool patterns could induce hypnosis.

If these and other elements are connected for anyone but Ms. Spradlin, it is most obviously by intensity. She is not trying to make sense. She is trying to push her dancers and her audience into some higher state.

At New York Live Arts in Chelsea on Thursday, the tension was kept high by Jeffrey Young's high-modernist score, played live by the composer on violin and three other musicians on bass, viola and bass clarinet. With slashing dissonances, melting chords and bits of buzzing that might have been programmatically titled ""The Mosquito,"" the music keeps signaling distress, even when Mr. Young's electronics aren't adding rumbles from an earthquake.

As a score to the film, ""Peach Blossom Weeps Tears of Blood,"" a melodrama about love across feudal class lines, the music is fatalistic, foreshadowing tragedy at every moment. That suits Ms. Spradlin's sensibility. It's telling that she chooses a melodrama but compresses it by a factor of 10, and that she sets it next to the sculpture by Glen Fogel, as inconspicuous as the Eye of Sauron.","The choreography of RoseAnne Spradlin was only one element in a multisensory program, ""g-h-o-s-t- c-r-o-w-n,"" at New York Live Arts.",77023e35-e6ca-5802-9e7b-2d6c711770a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/15/arts/14spradlin-1/14spradlin-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=402&w=600&s=1500477cfa9284f9e4df882cf5a54a08852c5c157836f09a1bd483b6473b6c27&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Natalie Green, left, and Rebecca Warner in RoseAnne Spradlin's ""g-h-o-s-t c-r-o-w-n (working title).""",77023e35-e6ca-5802-9e7b-2d6c711770a6,N24News/imgs/77023e35-e6ca-5802-9e7b-2d6c711770a6.jpg,6
Travel,Homestays: Finding Comfort in a Stranger's Home,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/10/travel/homestays.html,"While planning a trip to Peru last July, Brian Twite and his girlfriend, Constance Hansen, decided to skip hotels and stay with a host family. At $35 a night, the accommodation in the Santiago district of Cusco was a bargain. But the warmth of their host mother, a 65-year-old widow named Marie, won them over. ""We'd wake up and she'd yell, 'Chicos!', calling us for breakfast down the hall,"" said Mr. Twite, a Chicagoan who works in manufacturing logistics. After a long day of sightseeing in the Sacred Valley, Mr. Twite, 32, said he was grateful to come home and share highlights of his day with Marie and her son, Jonathan. ""You sit down to a meal and talk about your day. They asked us, 'What did you do? Where did you go?' That was really magical, because you don't get that with a hotel."" As travelers' appetites move toward wanting more intimate, locally driven and nongeneric experiences in recent years, homestays -- traditionally the fallback for backpackers and foreign exchange students -- are emerging in a new light.

""It's the best way to get a feel for the place you're visiting,"" said Cliff Carruthers, a retired urban planner in York, England, who booked a homestay in Pakistan last month. At London-based Wild Frontiers, a luxury tour planner, the founder, Jonny Bealby, says 80 percent of his tours today include at least some kind of homestay. In some cases, popular itineraries have been revised to include a homestay; a walking tour of Palestine that's been offered since 2013, for example, now features a village stay in Sanur. ""It's being driven by the customer,"" Mr. Bealby said, noting that travelers from London, Boston and New York seem willing to forgo the conveniences of a plush hotel every night. ""What they want to do is connect.""

Homestays also have a practical appeal. With Cuba's limited hotel inventory, homestays are often the best option. One boutique travel company, Pelorus, pairs guests with specific hosts and neighborhoods, depending on their interests -- food, music or retracing family roots. ""Homestays allow us to be more flexible,"" Jimmy Carroll, the company's co-founder, said. Of course, there is also the benefit of going further off the grid. Iya Romantei, a rustic 1950s cabin with tatami floors and firewood stacked outside the front door, is a hotel in Japan's Iya Valley, an ancient forested landscape six hours from Tokyo. It's also the home of Yasuki Shinomiya. Inside, guests sleep on futon mats and gather around the sunken irori hearth for home-cooked meals. Favorite activities include raiding the ""sake shrine"" (a comprehensive collection with more than 300 bottles) and soaking in the outdoor goemonburo (coal-fired hot tub) while enjoying plunging views of the surrounding mountains. Since 2012, more than 30 nationalities have logged entries in Mr. Shinomiya's guest book, and guests range in age from 2 to 80. An Australian woman came recently, he said, after booking one night at a fancy hotel in Tokyo. The reason for the detour? ""She wanted to feel nature."" On a trip to Granada in October, 30-year-old Jeanne Volomi chose a particular homestay because the owner had a son the same age as her own. ""He got language immersion and a roomful of toys to play with. It was pretty ideal,"" said Ms. Volomi, who lives in Colorado Springs, Colo. Toys weren't the only draw: the two-story house was tucked in the quiet Albayzin district, with plenty of space and a patio overlooking the entire city. Before booking, Ms. Volomi asked the homeowner to send her a short video of herself walking through the house, which she did. ""I feel like people are looking for safety,"" Ms. Volomi said. In June, Wild Frontiers created an itinerary that whisks travelers off to a remote corner of the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia. During the 11-day ""Altai Adventure"" tour, guests spend the night in basic pine huts alongside their host, a 42-year-old Altaian wolf hunter named Valerii Orgunov. (Meals are served in a separate felt yurt that once belonged to Valerii's grandparents.)","From a Peruvian mud-brick house to a wooden longhouse in Borneo, travelers are rediscovering the intimate thrill of a homestay.",a5152ddc-b436-531f-826d-1377dd53a847,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/15/travel/19trending-1/19trending-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=267a23d5cfd8aaff43b282feecb7d8f1c42eee1025aba4009b5e0c8d04306252&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Intrepid Travel organizes homestays in the village of Aroumd, Morocco.",a5152ddc-b436-531f-826d-1377dd53a847,N24News/imgs/a5152ddc-b436-531f-826d-1377dd53a847.jpg,4
Style,Julia Cameron Wants You to Do Your Morning Pages,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/02/style/julia-cameron-the-artists-way.html,"SANTA FE, N.M. -- On any given day, someone somewhere is likely leading an Artist's Way group, gamely knocking back the exercises of ""The Artist's Way"" book, the quasi-spiritual manual for ""creative recovery,"" as its author Julia Cameron puts it, that has been a lodestar to blocked writers and other artistic hopefuls for more than a quarter of a century. There have been Artist's Way clusters in the Australian outback and the Panamanian jungle; in Brazil, Russia, the United Kingdom and Japan; and also, as a cursory scan of Artist's Way Meetups reveals, in Des Moines and Toronto. It has been taught in prisons and sober communities, at spiritual retreats and New Age centers, from Esalen to Sedona, from the Omega Institute to the Open Center, where Ms. Cameron will appear in late March, as she does most years. Adherents of ""The Artist's Way"" include the authors Patricia Cornwell and Sarah Ban Breathnach. Pete Townshend, Alicia Keys and Helmut Newton have all noted its influence on their work. So has Tim Ferriss, the hyperactive productivity guru behind ""The Four Hour Workweek,"" though to save time he didn't actually read the book, ""which was recommended to me by many megaselling authors,"" he writes. He just did the ""Morning Pages,"" one of the book's central exercises. It requires you write three pages, by hand, first thing in the morning, about whatever comes to mind. (Fortunes would seem to have been made on the journals printed to support this effort.) The book's other main dictum is the ""Artist's Date"" -- two hours of alone time each week to be spent at a gallery, say, or any place where a new experience might be possible. Elizabeth Gilbert, who has ""done"" the book three times, said there would be no ""Eat, Pray, Love,"" without ""The Artist's Way."" Without it, there might be no adult coloring books, no journaling fever. ""Creativity"" would not have its own publishing niche or have become a ubiquitous buzzword -- the ""fat-free"" of the self-help world -- and business pundits would not deploy it as a specious organizing principle. The book's enduring success -- over 4 million copies have been sold since its publication in 1992 -- have made its author, a shy Midwesterner who had a bit of early fame in the 1970s for practicing lively New Journalism at the Washington Post and Rolling Stone, among other publications, and for being married, briefly, to Martin Scorsese, with whom she has a daughter, Domenica -- an unlikely celebrity. With its gentle affirmations, inspirational quotes, fill-in-the-blank lists and tasks -- write yourself a thank-you letter, describe yourself at 80, for example -- ""The Artist's Way"" proposes an egalitarian view of creativity: Everyone's got it.

The book promises to free up that inner artist in 12 weeks. It's a template that would seem to reflect the practices of 12-step programs, particularly its invocations to a higher power. But according to Ms. Cameron, who has been sober since she was 29, ""12 weeks is how long it takes for people to cook."" Now 70, she lives in a spare adobe house in Santa Fe, overlooking an acre of scrub and the Sangre de Cristo mountain range. She moved a few years ago from Manhattan, following an exercise from her book to list 25 things you love. As she recalled, ""I wrote juniper, sage brush, chili, mountains and sky and I said, 'This is not the Chrysler Building.'"" On a recent snowy afternoon, Ms. Cameron, who has enormous blue eyes and a nimbus of blonde hair, admitted to the jitters before this interview. ""I asked three friends to pray for me,"" she said. ""I also wrote a note to myself to be funny."" In the early 1970s, Ms. Cameron, who is the second oldest of seven children and grew up just north of Chicago, was making $67 a week working in the mail room of the Washington Post. At the same time, she was writing deft lifestyle pieces for the paper -- like an East Coast Eve Babitz. ""With a byline, no one knows you're just a gofer,"" she said. In her reporting, Ms. Cameron observed an epidemic of green nail polish and other ""Cabaret""-inspired behaviors in Beltway bars, and slyly reviewed a new party drug, methaqualone. She was also, by her own admission, a blackout drunk. ""I thought drinking was something you did and your friends told you about it later,"" she said. ""In retrospect, in cozy retrospect, I was in trouble from my first drink.""

In her memoir, ""Floor Sample,"" published in 2006, Ms. Cameron recounts the brutality of Hollywood, of her life there as a screenwriter and a drunk. Pauline Kael, she writes, described her as a ""pornographic Victorian valentine, like a young Angela Lansbury."" Don't marry her for tax reasons, Ms. Kael warns Mr. Scorsese. Andy Warhol, who escorts her to the premiere of ""New York, New York,"" inscribes her into his diary as a ""lush."" A cocaine dealer soothes her -- ""You have a tiny little wife's habit"" -- and a doctor shoos her away from his hospital when she asks for help, telling her she's no alcoholic, just a ""sensitive young woman."" She goes into labor in full makeup and a Chinese dressing gown, vowing to be ""no trouble."" ""I think it's fair to say that drinking and drugs stopped looking like a path to success,"" she said. ""So I luckily stopped. I had a couple of sober friends and they said, 'Try and let the higher power write through you.' And I said, What if he doesn't want to?' They said, 'Just try it.'"" So she did. She wrote novels and screenplays. She wrote poems and musicals. She wasn't always well-reviewed, but she took the knocks with typical grit, and she schooled others to do so as well. ""I have unblocked poets, lawyers and painters,"" she said. She taught her tools in living rooms and classrooms -- ""if someone was dumb enough to lend us one,"" she said -- and back in New York, at the Feminist Art Institute. Over the years, she refined her tools, typed them up, and sold Xeroxed copies in local bookstores for $20. It was her second husband, Mark Bryan, a writer, who needled her into making the pages into a proper book. The first printing was about 9,000 copies, said Joel Fotinos, formerly the publisher at Tarcher/Penguin, which published the book in 1992. There was concern that it wouldn't sell. ""Part of the reason,"" Mr. Fotinos said, ""was that this was a book that wasn't like anything else. We didn't know where to put it on the shelves -- did it go in religion or self-help? Eventually there was a category called 'creativity,' and 'The Artist's Way' launched it."" Now an editorial director at St. Martin's Press, Mr. Fotinos said he is deluged with pitches from authors claiming they've written ""the new Artist's Way.""

""But for Julia, creativity was a tool for survival,"" he said. ""It was literally her medicine and that's why the book is so authentic, and resonates with so many people."" ""I am my tool kits,"" Ms. Cameron said. And, indeed, ""The Artist's Way"" is stuffed with tools: worksheets to be filled with thoughts about money, childhood games, old hurts; wish lists and exercises, many of which seem exhaustive and exhausting -- ""Write down any resistance, angers and fears,"" e.g. -- and others that are more practical: ""Take a 20 minutes walk,"" ""Mend any mending"" and ""repot any pinched and languishing plants."" It anticipates the work of the indefatigable Gretchen Rubin, the happiness maven, if Ms. Rubin were a bit kinder but less Type-A. ""When I teach, it's like watching the lights come on,"" said Ms. Cameron. ""My students don't get lectured to. I think they feel safe. Rather than try and fix themselves, they learn to accept themselves. I think my work makes people autonomous. I feel like people fall in love with themselves."" Anne Lamott, the inspirational writer and novelist, said that when she was teaching writing full-time, her own students swore by ""The Artist's Way."" ""That exercise -- three pages of automatic writing -- w as a sacrament for people,"" Ms. Lamott wrote in a recent email. ""They could plug into something bigger than the rat exercise wheel of self-loathing and grandiosity that every writer experiences: 'This could very easily end up being an Oprah Book,' or 'Who do I think I'm fooling? I'm a subhuman blowhard.'"" ""She's given you an assignment that is doable, and I think it's kind of a cognitive centering device. Like scribbly meditation,"" Ms. Lamott wrote. ""It's sort of like how manicurists put smooth pebbles in the warm soaking water, so your fingers have something to do, and you don't climb the walls.""

Ms. Cameron continues to write her Morning Pages every day, even though she continues, as she said, to be grouchy upon awakening. She eats oatmeal at a local cafe and walks Lily, an eager white Westie. She reads no newspapers, or social media (perhaps the most grueling tenet of ""The Artist's Way"" is a week of ""reading deprivation""), though an assistant runs a Twitter and Instagram account on her behalf. She writes for hours, mostly musicals, collaborating with her daughter, a film director, and others. Ms. Cameron may be a veteran of the modern self-care movement but her life has not been all moonbeams and rainbows, and it shows. She was candid in conversation, if not quite at ease. ""So I haven't proven myself to be hilarious,"" she said with a flash of dry humor, adding that even after so many years, she still gets stage-fright before beginning a workshop. She has written about her own internal critic, imagining a gay British interior designer she calls Nigel. ""And nothing is ever good enough for Nigel,"" she said. But she soldiers on. She will tell you that she has good boundaries. But like many successful women, she brushes off her achievements, attributing her unlooked-for wins to luck. ""If you have to learn how to do a movie, you might learn from Martin Scorsese. If you have to learn about entrepreneurship, you might learn from Mark"" -- her second husband. ""So I'm very lucky,"" she said. ""If I have a hard time blowing my own horn, I've been attracted to people who blew it for me.""","With ""The Artist's Way,"" Julia Cameron invented the way people renovate the creative soul.",0b13a9e1-3729-51ef-aad3-030df3ab15bb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/03/fashion/03JULIACAMERON2/03JULIACAMERON2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c82173f78dd29482ca48181fce8e0d4dd6339cf20d98fa253d2badf8c8f6fac5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Under the pines.,0b13a9e1-3729-51ef-aad3-030df3ab15bb,N24News/imgs/0b13a9e1-3729-51ef-aad3-030df3ab15bb.jpg,15
Dance,"Anguish, Wackily Recalled",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/16/arts/dance/jack-fervers-night-light-bright-light.html,"""Night Light Bright Light,"" the latest work by the performance artist Jack Ferver, has been advertised as drawing inspiration from the dancer Fred Herko, best known for having committed suicide in 1964 by jumping out of a window in a grand jete. But it's foolish to expect a Jack Ferver piece to be about anyone other than Jack Ferver.

His previous work, ""Chambre,"" may have been an exception. I missed that one, but Mr. Ferver discusses it in ""Night Light,"" which had its premiere at the Abrons Arts Center on Wednesday as part of the American Realness festival. Sarcastically, he stresses how much time and effort he put into ""Chambre,"" in contrast to how little he devoted to ""Night Light,"" which he says he created for the anniversary of Mr. Herko's death. When he can't remember the date, the moment is funny, and it isn't. ""Night Light"" is as lazy as it pretends to be.

A couple of times, Mr. Ferver refers to Mr. Herko and his work, but this piece is mainly a collection of Ferver shtick, amusing and comforting if you're a Ferver fan. He dances and sings with deliberate ineptitude. He recites both sides of conversations with his therapist. He acts out, with his signature cartoonishness, a childhood fantasy of being tortured via the force-feeding of pudding.

He shifts abruptly between such comedy and maudlin disclosures from his traumatic past, as if his jaded persona were breaking down, but this, too, is just more shtick. He underlines how his manic performing might be a cover for suicidal tendencies and pain, yet in leaning so heavily on his old habits, he exposes them as defense mechanisms that have outlived their usefulness, even as theater.","Jack Ferver invokes the 1964 suicide of the dancer Fred Herko in his new piece, ""Night Light Bright Light.""",564853b8-5294-5bd7-9a53-f38d8f335a34,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/16/arts/16FERVER/FERVER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=b5b15473e9cf70288bf5b69d8fbeeafca431caef8ef98d523d3cde7275d9ed96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jack Ferver, aloft, and Reid Bartelme in ""Night Light Bright Light"" at the Abrons Arts Center.",564853b8-5294-5bd7-9a53-f38d8f335a34,N24News/imgs/564853b8-5294-5bd7-9a53-f38d8f335a34.jpg,6
Technology,Beware of this misinformation from 'Stop the Steal' rallies this weekend.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/technology/beware-of-this-misinformation-from-stop-the-steal-rallies-this-weekend.html,"In many cases, the claims have been bolstered by people conflating voting rolls, which list people who can potentially vote, with actual voting records. Those mistakes were often fixed before or during Election Day, and people who have passed away were removed from the voting roles. Lists that have circulated on social media sites sharing the names of dead people who supposedly voted have also largely been debunked by The Times and others.

No, voters are not casting hundreds of ballots under maiden names.

Fact: There is no evidence that any votes were cast by impersonators using maiden names.

Background: This rumor was started when a woman tweeted that her mother's maiden name had been stolen by someone who used it to vote. The tweet did not provide any evidence of the claim.

Election officials said there was no proof that individuals committed voter fraud by registering to vote, and then casting a vote using a maiden name. They added that they had received no individual complaints about specific cases.

No, a postal worker in Pennsylvania did not witness voter fraud.

Claim: A postal worker in Pennsylvania said he had seen his supervisor ""tampering with mail-in ballots.""

Fact: The postal worker retracted his claims, and no evidence was found to support what he had said.

Background: The claims originated in a video released by Project Veritas, a conservative group that has repeatedly spread disinformation. The video featured a postal worker, Richard Hopkins, who said he had overheard a discussion about backdating ballots that arrived in the mail after Election Day.

The video did not provide evidence of any voter fraud, and Mr. Hopkins did not say that he had seen any fraud occur. Mr. Hopkins later recanted his allegations, according to a report by the inspector general's office to Congress.",Events are being planned in many U.S. cities on Saturday by groups that are spreading false claims about voter fraud.,39354d0c-86df-5c31-813f-eb363aac2846,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/13/business/13distortions1/13distortions1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=904b9611c2a499952f3ec139a4227099014404cc27587b6eefcb86cbf0249c78&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A ""Stop the Steal"" protest at the Georgia State Capitol in Atlanta last week.",39354d0c-86df-5c31-813f-eb363aac2846,N24News/imgs/39354d0c-86df-5c31-813f-eb363aac2846.jpg,20
Food,How a Teeny-Weeny Chef Became a Great Big Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/dining/tiny-chef-miniature-food.html,"LOS ANGELES -- The chef stands only six inches tall, like an enchanted ball of moss sprung to life. Made of wood, foam latex and metal, he preps vegetables, simmers sauces and bakes pies the size of bottle caps, all while chattering in a lispy singsong that is mostly incomprehensible. As the title character of ""The Tiny Chef Show,"" a series of stop-motion videos, usually no longer than a minute, he has won a devoted following of 400,000 on Instagram. The posts resonate at a time when chefs are expected to manage multiple lives, not just as cooks, but as celebrities, social media influencers and ambassadors of their own personal brands. Several segments tell the meta story of the chef as a newcomer to Los Angeles, navigating his rising fame. He reacts to a tattoo of himself on a fan's body, and gushes over meeting the actor Kristen Bell, who is now a ""Tiny Chef"" producer. In a recent video, shot like a documentary, the chef is seen micromanaging the construction of his new kitchen, shouting about the importance of safety goggles.

His audience has grown rapidly since his first appearance last fall, and in June, Imagine Entertainment's new family division took an equity stake in ""The Tiny Chef,"" with plans to develop the franchise across various platforms. A children's book, ""The Tiny Chef"" (Razorbill), will be published in the fall of 2020, and a second book is in development. When I met the chef for the first time, early this month at a studio in Glendale, Calif., he was sitting in the palm of Rachel Larsen, an animator who created the character out of clay a decade ago and now directs ""The Tiny Chef Show."" The chef wore a rainbow-striped apron and a tall, puffy toque. He was a fuzzy, muted green, with an enormous round belly and long, skinny arms that reached down to his feet.

""Stop-motion is so slow, and it's a ton of work,"" Ms. Larsen said, ""but we want to underplay all of that."" As she adjusted the props, pulling clay and small pieces of felt from her tool kit -- a clear, CVS-brand pill box -- the chef became exponentially cuter and more expressive. His eyes seemed to peer into the camera and gleam. My brain turned to mush, the way it does when I see a puppy navigating a tall stair. I gazed longingly at the chef's adorable saucepans and sweet little oven made to look like an old tomato can. Admiring the knife and wooden cutting board on the mini marble counter, I suppressed an actual squeal. This can be the effect of tiny foods. Edible or not, they're part of a vast subgenre of miniatures.

The couple behind one video series, ""The Tiny Foods,"" make mini Maggi noodles, dosas and paya (braised goat trotters), for more than 500,000 subscribers on YouTube. Another, ""Miniature Cusina,"" has grown its audience to more than a million, adding an audio component meant to create a euphoric, brain-tingling feeling known as autonomous sensory meridian response, or A.S.M.R. In a recent video for pork sinigang, you can hear the satisfying, outsize sizzle of teeny onions. The most compelling videos in the genre have always been simple, familiar and comforting. Everyday kitchen tasks recreated in miniature -- a ladle pouring miso soup into bowls at the table, a knife cutting a grilled cheese sandwich on the diagonal -- can somehow hold a viewer's attention in mesmerized appreciation. You may notice a chip in one of the bowls, the way the noodles cling, or the uneven browning on the bread. The thrill of well-made tiny food isn't in flawlessness, but in meticulous replication, beautiful in its ordinariness and imperfection.

Early videos of the chef were produced on a shoestring budget, but the ""Tiny Chef"" team is finding ways to monetize its growing audience with tiered sponsorship deals. (For $60,000, they will produce a 60-second sponsored short and run it as an ad on their Instagram feed). They are currently working on a video for La-Z-Boy, though most of the other brands featured on the show aren't sponsors. The chef has made burgers with Beyond Meat's plant-based meat substitutes, seasoned sauces with Morton Salt and dusted the dough for his seasonal pies with Pillsbury flour. In one of my favorite video s -- I've watched it a dozen times -- the chef sings while cutting a slice off a single clove of garlic. It's already more than he needs. He minces this slice, then saws off the edge of a tomato. Overtaken by pure joy, he holds a basil leaf over his head and closes his eyes. The chef dances, free and easy, as if a basil leaf was the most magnificent thing in the world. As if half a million fans weren't watching.","The Tiny Chef, the rotund, blissfully humming protagonist of a hit stop-motion video series online, is just the latest testament to the charms of miniature food.",85b2794a-3c97-54c5-bc2b-70868dbe5887,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/21/dining/21tiny01/21tiny01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2362b502903d272e259aae45c9edba4dece16dc10644b21baba1a98dd75fa5a8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Since his first appearance on social media last fall, the Tiny Chef has amassed a cult following with a series of stop-motion cooking videos.",85b2794a-3c97-54c5-bc2b-70868dbe5887,N24News/imgs/85b2794a-3c97-54c5-bc2b-70868dbe5887.jpg,17
Music,The Best Classical Music of 2018,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/arts/music/the-best-classical-music-of-2018.html," Read all about it, and listen to some of our favorite artists. Best Surprises | Best Performances | Best Pianists | Best Ensemble

We depend on the composers and performers we admire to keep enriching us. But it is even more exciting when great artists surprise us, as several did for me during an exceptional year in music. When the New York Philharmonic chose Mr. van Zweden as its music director, the orchestra went for a maestro known for powerful accounts of repertory staples. His commitment to contemporary music seemed less certain. As if in defiant reply, he opened each of his first three Philharmonic programs this fall with the premiere of a commissioned work. Mr. van Zweden began with a boldly unconventional piece by a young American: Ashley's Fure's dark, strange, exploratory ""Filament"" for orchestra, three instrumental soloists and a chorus that moves around the space. For almost 15 minutes, David Geffen Hall was turned into a haunting aural environment through Ms. Fure's mystical, atmospheric music, by turns dreamy and dangerous. The following week, Mr. van Zweden led Conrad Tao's ""Everything Must Go,"" written as a curtain-raiser for Bruckner's sprawling Eighth Symphony. Combining seriousness and youthful abandon, Mr. Tao grappled with Bruckner's symphony in his restless piece. A Dutch modernist master, Louis Andriessen, provided the third premiere, ""Agamemnon,"" a teeming, raucous, strangely alluring 20-minute score. In another encouraging sign, Mr. van Zweden introduced and hosted two contemporary music initiatives, presenting Mr. Tao in an eclectic ""Nightcap"" program at the Kaplan Penthouse, and Mr. Andriessen in a substantive ""Sound On"" concert at Jazz at Lincoln Center. What's still open to question, actually, is Mr. van Zweden's approach to the staples that are supposedly his specialties. My reactions have been mixed, at best, to his accounts of that Bruckner symphony and other works including Stravinsky's ""Rite of Spring"" and Debussy's ""La Mer.""

It was a gamble for this soprano to sing the touchstone title role of Puccini's ""Tosca"" for the first time ever this spring at the Metropolitan Opera. But she knew what she was doing. From her first entrance, Ms. Netrebko was every bit Puccini's passionate, vulnerable and charismatic heroine, a renowned prima donna in 1800 Rome. She captured every nuance of the music and Tosca's volatile emotions with rapturous, tender, fierce singing. She was just as riveting at the Met this fall in the title role of Verdi's ""Aida."" The Met's general manager, Peter Gelb, should follow her around with contracts in hand. I expected beautiful Chopin from this young Russian pianist, a brilliant virtuoso with poetic sensibilities, in two programs early this year that were part of his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall. But I was impressed by his formidable playing of nine daunting 20th-century works in the ambitious concert with which he ended his series. Called ""Decades,"" the program offered Mr. Trifonov's personal survey of the century, with works by Berg, Prokofiev, Bartok, Copland, Messiaen, Ligeti, Stockhausen and more. We are used to watching him play challenging concertos and etudes effortlessly. But on this night, Mr. Trifonov let us see him sweat. Since its premiere in 2012, the opera ""Written on Skin,"" by this British composer and the librettist Martin Crimp, has been produced around the world and acclaimed as one of the most important operas of our time. Could the team do it again? Yes, as they proved in May with the premiere of ""Lessons in Love and Violence"" at the Royal Opera House in London. Mining the relationship of Edward II and his courier Piers Gaveston, this disturbingly tragic opera offers an object lesson in what can transpire when an absolute ruler conflates his personal desires with the identity of his suffering nation. Mr. Benjamin's score, though unabashedly modernist, was beguiling and mysterious. In 2011, a 19-year-old Army private named Danny Chen killed himself at an outpost in Afghanistan after suffering months of vicious hazing and racist taunts. Three years later, this composer and the playwright David Henry Hwang turned the harrowing story into a 60-minute chamber opera. Taking a risk, they expanded the piece into a full two-hour work, ""An American Soldier,"" which had its premiere this summer at Opera Theater of St. Louis. This inventive and searing opera could not have been more relevant in an America riven by issues of race, war and bullying. The opera shifts between scenes in which the ghost of Pvt. Chen witnesses the trial of his sergeant for negligent homicide, and flashbacks from his teenage life: hanging out with friends in New York's Chinatown, making dinner with his mother in the kitchen, arriving for basic training full of patriotism and zeal.

These are the concerts and operas (and a couple of films) that have stuck with me through months filled to overflowing with music. They run the gamut -- Verdi and Julius Eastman, Bach and Ashley Fure -- but all shared that mixture of confidence and adventurousness that defines a memorable performance. This young Georgian mezzo-soprano had been daringly grim in ""Carmen"" and sensuous in ""Prince Igor"" in recent seasons at the Metropolitan Opera, but I was still unprepared for her overwhelming portrayal of Azucena in Verdi's ""Il Trovatore"" in January, sung with bel canto elegance and startling authority. She brought warmth, fear and eloquence back to a character that can often be merely blunt, then followed up the feat in September, conjuring a seductive yet implacable Amneris in Verdi's ""Aida."" (As far as staged opera, just Patricia Racette's sensitive, richly rueful Elle in ""La Voix Humaine,"" at Opera Philadelphia in September, has stayed with me so strongly.) The return of the vital, stormy music of the composer Julius Eastman, who died in obscurity in 1990, has been an inspiring story in recent years. His resurgence took a major step forward with this festival, organized in January and February by the artist Tiona Nekkia McClodden, Dustin Hurt of the Philadelphia arts organization Bowerbird, and the Kitchen in Chelsea. It included a revival of the jeweled ""Femenine"" and a clangorous, intense evening of Eastman's moody works for multiple pianos.

Few pleasures could equal the spectacle of this masterly musician playing all six of Bach's suites for solo cello in a space where the composer worked, St. Nicholas Church in Leipzig, Germany. Given on a September evening with honesty, straightforwardness and lack of exaggeration, the music was milked for neither laughter nor tears, with a tone like wire coated in silk. Mr. Ma's final three suites, in particular, radiated visionary focus and fervor. (For instrumental recitals, only Yuja Wang's unnerving program of Rachmaninoff, Scriabin and Prokofiev at Carnegie Hall in May could match it.) The centennial, last year, of the birth of the composer Lou Harrison was celebrated in April and May by a choreographer who's always relished his smilingly ritualistic music, rhythmic yet relaxed. In the memorably intimate environs of his Dance Center, Mr. Morris -- who sat in on percussion with the small, excellent musical ensemble -- put on a program of works that culminated in the sweeping, enigmatic primordial society of ""Grand Duo."" Delicious quirks abound at this annual weekend-long event in an eccentric valley east of Santa Barbara, Calif. Each year a different artist organizes the festival; this June brought the earnest, raucous violinist Patricia Kopatchinskaja, who dived into organizing and performing alike with gusto. She corralled the JACK Quartet into performances of sumptuous serenity; early-morning Morton Feldman followed late-night John Luther Adams. And she persuaded Markus Hinterhauser, the pianist who runs the Salzburg Festival, to join her in duets by the reclusive Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya; he then played alone the hourlong cycle of Ustvolskaya's six piano sonatas, a dumbfounding achievement of concentration and dignity. A re-encounter that demanded a re-evaluation. I had remembered John Adams's 2005 opera about the Manhattan Project as stolid and overlong. But in a pared-down production by Peter Sellars (also the work's librettist) this summer at Santa Fe Opera -- an enormous sphere hung above a bare stage -- it was lean and surreal, alternating lush, ominous sensuality and pummeling intensity. A superb cast led by Ryan McKinny and Julia Bullock was conducted, with an instinct for tension, by Matthew Aucoin.

A one-two punch this year brought this young composer firmly into the New York musical spotlight. First, at Lincoln Center's Mostly Mozart Festival in the summer, ""The Force of Things,"" the glacial, scary ""opera for objects"" she created with her brother, the architect Adam Fure, used harrowing softness -- even inaudibility -- to evoke the permeating anxiety of our mounting ecological crisis. Then, at the concert that opened Jaap van Zweden's tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic, came ""Filament,"" a slyly ominous drone of a fanfare. Brooding on the impossibility of the American dream, Missy Mazzoli and Royce Vavrek's tense, creepy new opera, which came to the Miller Theater at Columbia University in September, shows the fracturing of a homestead family suffering on the brutal Nebraska plains. The setting is the middle of the 19th century, but the lessons -- about prosperity, virility, patriotism and cycles of violence -- are crushingly contemporary. And Ms. Mazzoli's score, for just a dozen or so players, is a landscape of shimmering aridity. An era ended with the November premiere, after many false hopes over the past decade, of this opera by the 92-year-old Hungarian master Gyorgy Kurtag at the Teatro alla Scala in Milan. A series of scenes and monologues extracted from the Beckett play ""Endgame,"" it is a work of utterly assured starkness -- confident and patient. The music seems to wrap around and subtly trail off the words; the lucid orchestra is neither bullying nor reticent, producing an atmosphere of gnomic, melancholy beauty. It is, like its Beckett source, tender, transparent, unsentimental and unsparing. The year ended with the release of two essential documents of two of the 20th century's greatest divas. ""Maria by Callas"" is an impressionistic, melancholy portrait -- primarily a self-portrait, heavy on candid, little-read letters -- of a meteoric rise and agonizing decline. ""Amazing Grace"" is a sweatily veristic immersion in the recording of Aretha Franklin's 1972 gospel album -- with choir, in front of amazed, raucous audiences in an intimate Los Angeles church. We hear Callas sing ""Ah! non credea"" from Bellini's ""La Sonnambula,"" rapt in hurt. We hear Franklin close with ""Never Grow Old,"" her tone focused, her phrasing transcendently free. The passing details that bring these giants to human life are what catch your heart: Aretha clasping the Rev. James Cleveland's hand behind her back while she sings; a jokey glance from Callas as she walks backstage. ""Maria by Callas"" is crushing; ""Amazing Grace,"" a teeming potluck of virtuosity and heart.

The 21-year-old Daniil Trifonov arrived at Lincoln Center in 2012 with a dazzling yet nuanced account of Prokofiev's Third Piano Concerto. Igor Levit, shortly after his 27th birthday in 2014, fearlessly played Beethoven's late piano sonatas at the Park Avenue Armory with maturity beyond his years. In those New York debuts, Mr. Trifonov and Mr. Levit already showed the makings of greatness. But they truly blossomed this year with performances -- onstage and in the recording studio -- that surpassed their past achievements and brought their artistry to thrilling heights. Mr. Trifonov concluded his Perspectives series at Carnegie Hall in May with ""Decades,"" a survey of 20th-century piano music and a departure from the Romantic repertory that made him famous. I won't forget Stockhausen's ""Klavierstuck IX"": Mr. Trifonov hunched over, sweat dripping from his long hair, hands hesitating ever so slightly before landing, confidently, on the keyboard with a mighty chord. It was the first time I'd ever seen him struggle, and the moment I realized he was capable of much more than showy war horse concertos. This fall, Mr. Levit followed a three-disc album of variations by Bach, Beethoven and Rzewski with ""Life,"" a meditative yet sweeping response to the death of his best friend. (He played much of it in an outstanding recital at Carnegie's Zankel Hall in October.) His recording of Wagner's ""Solemn March to the Holy Grail"" from ""Parsifal,"" as transcribed by Liszt, is one the most hauntingly sublime tracks of the year. This is the type of searching album you would expect of a musician late in his career; Mr. Levit is just 31. And apparently still aiming higher: By November, he was back in the studio.

Mr. Wubbels is one of seven directors of Wet Ink. Other performers in the group include the composer-saxophonist Alex Mincek (who made The New York Times's best classical recordings list in 2017), as well as the violinist Josh Modney (whose triple-disc set ""Engage"" was another highlight of 2018). Then there is the best-known composer in the ensemble, the soprano Kate Soper, whose charming and invigorating opera-slash-humanities lecture ""Ipsa Dixit"" arrived at the Miller Theater at Columbia University this fall, as well as on a new album from New World Records. It can start to seem a little unfair to the rest of the contemporary classical scene to put albums by this crew in every year-end list. On the 20th anniversary of their founding, perhaps it's enough to call them the best band of 2018.","In a year of beginnings, the Jaap van Zweden era started at the New York Philharmonic, and the 92-year-old composer Gyorgy Kurtag's first opera had its premiere.",8c8a816c-1713-5eb5-bfd8-c11d09f3089b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/09/arts/09BESTOFCLASSICAL2018/09BESTOFCLASSICAL2018-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b7363eaf70ce34b1b2c81e56b2808ed1403cef39f053168f74c201ea240b4be4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The best classical music of the year included, from left, Igor Levit, Jaap van Zweden, the opera ""Fin de Partie,"" Kate Soper, Yo-Yo Ma and Anna Netrebko.",8c8a816c-1713-5eb5-bfd8-c11d09f3089b,N24News/imgs/8c8a816c-1713-5eb5-bfd8-c11d09f3089b.jpg,12
Dance,Our Critics Pick the Dance Moves (and Objects) to See This Fall,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/arts/dance-fall-preview.html,"No! No! No! Every generation of modernist artists has applied a firm negative to points championed by the previous generation. In the 1960s, when large parts of the world were still taken aback by the dance negations implied or stated by Martha Graham (no to frivolity or merely surface psychology), George Balanchine (no to most decor or costume excess), and Merce Cunningham (no to conventional musicality), the young rebels around the Judson Memorial Church in New York went further. In a now-famous manifesto, the dancer-choreographer Yvonne Rainer wrote ""No to spectacle. No to virtuosity. No to transformations and magic and make-believe ... "" and 10 further ""noes."" She, Trisha Brown, David Gordon and other dance experimentalists became associated with paring dance down to new essentials. Their influence has grown, both in New York and internationally; there are young and youngish choreographers today who seem inhibited by the Judson legacy, eager to keep earning their Judson qualifications. Now the Museum of Modern Art presents ""Judson Dance Theater: The Work Is Never Done"" (Sept. 16-Feb. 3). By means of live performance, film, photography, sculpture, musical scores, poetry and archival materials, it will chart Judson Dance Theater's history. The filmmaker and multidisciplinary artist Charles Atlas will be a central link. The exhibition is to feature several core Judson figures in successive waves: Yvonne Rainer (Sept. 16-23), Deborah Hay (Sept. 24- Oct. 7), David Gordon (Oct. 8-21), Lucinda Childs (Oct. 22-Nov. 4), Steve Paxton (Nov. 19-Dec. 16) and Trisha Brown (Dec. 17-Jan. 16). For those who missed the original Judson moment and who have experienced these artists in separate contexts, the MoMA show will be an opportunity to reassess and rethink history and to watch works, long unperformed, that once seemed to redefine dance: Do they still seem challenging and important? Performances, sometimes two or three a day, will be accompanied by historical film footage.

In recent years, Ms. Rainer -- whose ""Trio A"" has become the seminal work of postmodern dance -- has been wildly inconsistent; but at her best she's been witty, mischievous, inventive. Were those virtues present 57 years ago? Most of this exhibition's Rainer choreography derives from 1961-69; the earliest, ""Three Satie Spoons"" (1961), has a title I can't resist. And I'm keen to improve my scant acquaintance with the work of Ms. Hay, who has been a singularly inspiring figure for many connoisseurs of dance postmodernism. Ms Childs's best work, in my view, was all pre-1980, but we seldom see it; four of her 1963-78 creations will be performed here. Ms. Brown, often the most sensuous, as well as among the most cerebral, of the group -- and eventually its most celebrated artist -- died in 2017; several of her 1968-85 dances will be revived Oct. 10-13 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, while for this Judson exhibition Mr. Atlas is preparing an installation of films of her work. Among the living, I have highest hopes for the work of David Gordon and Steve Paxton. Mr. Gordon's ""Live Archiveography"" was a 2017 highlight for me; he has often specialized in constructing Pirandellian or Stoppardian mazes from the meetings of art and life. Whereas others are being represented by anthologies of shorter works, he is taking just one, ""The Matter"" (1971, originally for 40 dancers, some trained, some not) and reworking it. In terms of sheer scale, this is likely to be the most substantial single piece of this Judson retrospective. Mr. Paxton was an exceptional performer (apart from the ballerina Lynn Seymour, the only dancer I've known to share a program with Mikhail Baryshnikov and make a yet more remarkable impression); and in 2017 he passed on much of his electrifying intensity and vivifying detail to the Stephen Petronio Company, when it revived his ""Goldberg Variations"" (1986-92). Now Petronio and Company will perform Paxton in this Judson show. ALASTAIR MACAULAY

William Forsythe would like the world to understand a thing or two about choreography -- not from the distance of a proscenium stage, but from the inside out. In ""William Forsythe: Choreographic Objects,"" which opens at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston, on Oct. 31, Mr. Forsythe expands the notion of choreography with a selection of interactive sculptures, participatory objects and video installations that span the past two decades. The first comprehensive show of Mr. Forsythe's installation pieces in the United States, ""Choreographic Objects"" involves viewer participation. Don't be put off: It's an adventure waiting to be experienced. In ""Nowhere and Everywhere at the Same Time, No. 3"" (2015), Mr. Forsythe has created a maze of 80 hanging pendulums -- giving the spectator the playful (and humbling) task of navigating through them. ""The Fact of the Matter"" (2009) features gymnastic rings, hanging by the ceiling at various lengths. The aim is to move through space using only the rings. And in ""Towards the Diagnostic Gaze"" (2013), the trick is to hold a feather duster absolutely still. It's impossible -- you find that you're suddenly a bundle of micro-movements. In all of his experiments, Mr. Forsythe gives you a rare gift: a chance to rediscover your body. As the director of the Frankfurt Ballet from 1984 to 2004, and the more experimental Forsythe Company from 2005 to 2015, Mr. Forsythe stretched dance to daring extremes. Recently, his interest in ballet has been renewed. In October at Sadler's Wells in London, he will present ""A Quiet Evening of Dance,"" described as a ""distillation of the geometric origins of classical ballet."" In March, he will unveil a premiere at Boston Ballet. And for something closer to home, New York City Ballet's winter season features the return of Mr. Forsythe's ""Herman Schmerman."" Here, his choreographic objects are the dancers. GIA KOURLAS When Balanchine began in New York

The company moved in 1964 to the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch), much larger and designed to Balanchine's specifications, in then-new Lincoln Center, where it still performs. But it's those early years that will be celebrated this fall (Oct. 31-Nov. 4) at City Center as part of the theater's 75th anniversary events. Joining the festivities are dancers from many of the world's greatest companies: Mariinsky Ballet, The Royal Ballet, Paris Opera Ballet, San Francisco Ballet, Miami City Ballet, Joffrey Ballet, American Ballet Theater and, of course, New York City Ballet. All 13 works are by Balanchine -- big and small, widely performed (""The Four Temperaments"") and somewhat rare (the ""Glinka Pas de Trois""). Just over half had their debuts at City Center, and history buffs will pine for omissions from a fertile period (""La Valse,"" ""Orpheus,"" ""Episodes,"" the list of the left-out is long). Yet the festival is likely to be less about how the City Center years were distinct than about distinctions among the participating troupes. As with the three-company performances of Balanchine's ""Jewels"" last year, dancers from different traditions will bring out different facets of Balanchine style -- all illuminating but not all equal. Even at City Center, New York City Ballet will again have the home advantage, and not only because its orchestra will be accompanying everyone. Wherever City Ballet performs, Balanchine style is its home. BRIAN SEIBERT

When it comes to making art, a specific prompt can be both inspiring and limiting. For last year's ""We're Watching"" series at Bard College, the prompt was to create a work on the theme of surveillance -- to explore the question, as the curator Gideon Lester put it, ""What is the effect of the surveillance state on the experience of being human?"" The choreographer Will Rawls, the poet Claudia Rankine and the filmmaker John Lucas -- collaborating for the first time -- responded with ""What Remains,"" in which they considered the relationship between being watched and being black in America. Ms. Rankine's ""Citizen"" and ""Don't Let Me Be Lonely"" served as jumping-off points for a haunting work of poetry remixed with movement, song and video.","Judson Dance Theater at MoMA; William Forsythe's ""Choreographic Objects""; Balanchine at City Center; and a Claudia Rankine-Will Rawls collaboration.",b6154173-a71e-5935-96bb-4229b3f2ef43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/arts/16fallpicksdance-alastair/16fallpicksdance-alastair-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e3bfe68e924fc0dcee2380e65d6f1578d923e210905bb179ae2092eba45d11e0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Trisha Brown and Steve Paxton performing in Brown&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lightfall&rdquo; at Judson Memorial Church in 1963.,b6154173-a71e-5935-96bb-4229b3f2ef43,N24News/imgs/b6154173-a71e-5935-96bb-4229b3f2ef43.jpg,6
Books,Assaults and Occupations in Wartime,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/books/review/james-holland-sicily-43-donald-johnson-occupied-america.html,"Academic histories are all very well, but at times it is a pleasure to sit back and wallow in an old-school military tale of flinty-eyed men doing battle. That is what James Holland, a seasoned craftsman, offers in SICILY '43: The First Assault on Fortress Europe (Atlantic Monthly Press, $30). He doesn't wade into gender issues, ""periodization,"" patriarchism or other currently fashionable matters. Rather, he simply gives us a history of Anglo-Saxon males slaughtering one another while Italians mainly try to get out of the way. Academic historians like to call a certain optimistic type of approach ""Whig history."" By contrast, I'd call Holland's book ""Tory history"" -- and mean it mainly as a compliment.

Holland fortifies his style with dollops of British slang. George Patton is depicted ""still chuntering on"" about an alleged lack of sufficient air cover for his invasion forces. (Holland summarizes Patton as ""a strange beast"" with ""obvious shortcomings,"" which strikes me as harsh but fair.) Any historian who views British commanders of the campaign as treating American forces unfairly ""really does need knocking on the head.""

As that last line indicates, Holland is comfortable with delving into the historiography of the Sicily campaign. He refutes the notion that the Allies made a huge mistake by allowing 29,000 German soldiers to escape the island to the Italian mainland, noting that it was impossible for Allied aircraft or ships to operate in the Strait of Messina. He does pay attention to errors of the Allies -- the lethal mess the British made trying to land troops in gliders, and the fact that two American soldiers murdered 82 prisoners of war. But over all, he concludes that the Allied achievement in taking Sicily in the summer of 1943 was greater than has been appreciated by most historians. In one memorable passage he portrays a German general gazing down at the huge American invasion fleet and concluding that Sicily was lost -- and probably the entire global war as well.

Donald F. Johnson studies an earlier British military operation in OCCUPIED AMERICA: British Military Rule and the Experience of Revolution (University of Pennsylvania Press, $34.95). Johnson teaches at North Dakota State University but generally avoids the buzzwords of academia, except for using the currently fashionable term ""contingent"" or ""contingency"" four times in the book's initial nine pages. His thesis is that the humiliations and deprivation of occupation turned many Americans against the British. I was unpersuaded by this -- it seems to me that after the British defeat at Yorktown, everyone knew the jig was up and even Loyalists began revising their plans -- but I was absorbed by Johnson's depiction of occupied America.",Two new books look at men in battle and civilians under occupation.,1f1d09f9-84a7-551f-8cdd-c5f0e665752d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/29/books/review/29Ricks/29Ricks-facebookJumbo.jpg,"A British soldier preparing to invade Sicily, July 1943.",1f1d09f9-84a7-551f-8cdd-c5f0e665752d,N24News/imgs/1f1d09f9-84a7-551f-8cdd-c5f0e665752d.jpg,13
Art & Design,"In the Swim of Digital Images, There's Nothing Boring About Sculpture",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/02/arts/design/Charles-Ray-Bertoldo-de-Giovanni-bronzes.html,"At the Frick Collection, the bronze statuette ""Bellerophon Taming Pegasus"" was designed by Bertoldo di Giovanni and executed by Adriano Fiorentino, ca. 1480-82. Bertoldo created the wax original -- an ancient technique that Florentine artists had recently rediscovered. His collaborator did the casting.



In 1846, back when critics were not yet afraid of rendering judgments, Charles Baudelaire went to the Paris Salon and wrote a review that aimed to put an entire art form out of business. Under the title ""Why Sculpture Is Boring,"" Baudelaire argued that bronze and marble statuary was vague and elusive, and ""presents too many faces at once"" -- 100 different angles -- to the spectator. He thought sculpture lacked the authority of painting or architecture, which both made clear where they stand. When ""a chance illumination, an effect of lamplight, reveals a beauty which was not the one he had thought of,"" the sculptor must sadly accept that three-dimensional art is always fated to depend on the circumstances of its display. That makes it, the poet insisted, nothing but ""a complementary art."" Baudelaire's critique was just one of many anti-sculpture broadsides over the last two centuries, mostly delivered by painters -- and by those critics in the tank for them. (Ad Reinhardt, maybe apocryphally, said in the 1950s that sculpture was ""something you bump into when you back up to look at the painting."") But something interesting has changed in the camera phone age: Suddenly, a sculpture's infinite perspectives and mutable viewing conditions provide new prospects in the gallery and on the web. To Baudelaire, sculpture disappointed by refusing to resolve into a single point of view, but to the camera phone-conditioned eye, that refusal is an opportunity. Every sculpture, to the contemporary viewer, is first a solid thing in the gallery and then a font of subsequent images, co-authored by artist and viewer.

I've spent a lot of the past season thinking about the contemporary relevance of sculpture, and how we experience solidity, weight and dimension in the era of the cloud. It's a question that framed my viewing of Verrocchio's works in bronze and terra cotta, on view through Jan. 12 at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. It exercises contemporary sculptors as different as Richard Serra, Rachel Harrison, Nairy Baghramian and Andra Ursuta, who all presented major new shows recently in New York. It looms over the rolling controversies over public monuments, which solidify history in metal or stone, then deliquesce into pixels on Google Street View. And it provides the unexpected link between two extraordinary sculptors, working five centuries apart, who each updated the classical sculpture tradition for new audiences looking with new eyes.

The older of these two artists is Bertoldo di Giovanni (circa 1440-1491), whose small but varied output in bronze, wood and terra cotta anchored the fall season at the Frick Collection. Bertoldo enjoyed the patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent, the biggest hot shot of 15th-century Florence, and yet he produced relatively little; today he is most often spoken about as the student of Donatello and teacher of Michelangelo. This first-ever retrospective, which closes Jan. 12 and contains almost every surviving work, sticks up for Bertoldo as a multimedia resuscitator of the art of classical Rome, whether in Lorenzo-celebrating portrait medals or in an entire terra cotta frieze that topped the entrance of a Medici country house (a striking loan from a Tuscan museum). Nude men and gods, twisting and writhing, were Bertoldo's predicament and prize. An arresting, full-scale statue of St. Jerome, made of painted wood and credited here to Donatello and Bertoldo working together, embodies the hermit priest as a lithe but wretched penitent, face pained and abdomen collapsed as he strikes his chest with a rock. Yet to a 21st-century eye, the most challenging and surprising work here is a serpentine bronze statuette of Orpheus, done around 1471 and on loan from the Bargello in Florence. Just 17 inches tall, with a tiny waist and unmuscled thighs and buttocks, this Orpheus looks more like a boy than a man as he sings, dances and plays a Renaissance string instrument called a lira da braccio. Get up close and you'll see that the bronze is abraded and unfinished, especially on Orpheus's lyre and on the animal pelt draped over his chest -- the result of an only partial mastery of the lost-wax process of metal casting, which involves forming a clay mold around a wax figure, heating it so the wax melts away, and then filling the cavity with liquid metal. It was an ancient technique that Florentine artists had only recently rediscovered. Bertoldo's ""Orpheus,"" for all its antique inspiration, is a work of a new, or newly revived, engineering process, whose glitchy rusticity has both a human and a technological derivation.

Bronze statuette works grew in refinement and finish later in the Renaissance and into the Baroque era. The financier and art collector J. Tomilson Hill, whose collection of bronzes went on view at the Frick in 2014, now exhibits his cache of statuettes in an airy, white-walled space in Chelsea -- alongside works of contemporary art. Right now at the Hill Art Foundation you can see five Renaissance bronzes alongside the sculpture of Charles Ray, the deep-thinking and slow-working Los Angeles sculptor who has rethought the classical tradition for our age as profoundly as Bertoldo did for his.

For Mr. Ray, sculptural invention takes the form of an excessive perfectionism, in which new scanning and casting technologies permit thrillingly off-key riffs on ancient forebears. In the low-slung sterling silver sculpture ""Mountain Lion Attacking a Dog"" (2018), for example, the artist embodies a predator sinking its teeth into the flesh of its upturned prey, updating the Greek and Roman taste for group sculptures of animals to today's Hollywood Hills. (This work's most evident art historical precedent is the marble sculpture ""Lion Attacking a Horse,"" at the Capitoline Museum in Rome -- a favorite of Bertoldo's disciple Michelangelo.) The lion's painstakingly chased fur recalls the contrasts of clean and striated bronze in Bertoldo's ""Orpheus,"" though now the technology at hand is different. For Bertoldo, the intermediate step between the initial figure and the metal cast was a layer of wax. For Mr. Ray, it is 3-D scanning and CNC machining: highly precise technologies that translate objects into data that can be output to a robotic mill. For both the metal sculpture stands as an uncanny replica or transformation of bodies we know, given new integrity and new value (literally, in the case of silver and bronze casts). What makes these sculptures compelling -- and what Baudelaire hated about them -- is the cryptic and unfathomable faces they offer as we circle them in the gallery, beholding them from all sides, scrutinizing their chasing and their patinas.

What interests me now is how young audiences may perceive these sculptures, and how the social photo has transformed our appreciation of them. For more and more viewers, the phone screen conditions almost all visual perception -- and this is true even at a museum like the Frick, where, nearly alone among New York museums, you cannot take photographs. Whether the smartphone comes out or stays in your pocket, our eyes are already being reformatted to follow the logic of digital images, where life becomes pictures and pictures become information. Sculpture, much more than maybe any art form, can offer viewers the satisfaction of oscillating between reality and virtuality, between object and image. (Unlike installation art, which too often recedes into a selfie backdrop, a sculpture retains its potency as it's channeled with light and shadow from gallery into the social media feed.) Baudelaire's anxiety about sculpture as a ""complementary art"" has drained away. The new challenge, when we look at Renaissance or modern sculpture, is to somehow still appreciate mass, volume and scale when all that is solid melts into the screen.

Technology,Trump Spread Multiple Conspiracy Theories on Monday. Here Are Their Roots.,https://www.nytimes.com/article/trump-conspiracy-theories.html,"[Follow our live coverage of the Biden inauguration.]

In a wide-ranging interview with the Fox News host Laura Ingraham on Monday night, President Trump spread multiple conspiracy theories about the protests that have erupted across the nation. Many of his unfounded claims can be traced back to narratives that have been swirling online for months.

Here are three of the baseless conspiracy theories that Mr. Trump spread and where they came from.

A plane 'loaded with thugs' headed to the Republican convention.

During the interview with Ms. Ingraham, Mr. Trump claimed that ""we had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane it was almost completely loaded with thugs, wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms, with gear and this and that.""

Mr. Trump then alleged that the people were headed to Washington, D.C., to disrupt the Republican National Convention.

There is no evidence of a flight matching Mr. Trump's description. But the claim is similar to a baseless allegation that appeared online as early as June, when a wave of cities and towns became alarmed by unsubstantiated rumors that the loose collective of anti-fascist activists known as antifa was being sent into their communities to disrupt the peace.",The unfounded ideas have been circulating online for months.,f66474d8-062a-50b1-8267-f45bdc7b0641,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/01/business/01trumpconspiracy/01trumpconspiracy-facebookJumbo.jpg,A screenshot from Laura Ingraham's interview with President Trump on Fox News on Monday.,f66474d8-062a-50b1-8267-f45bdc7b0641,N24News/imgs/f66474d8-062a-50b1-8267-f45bdc7b0641.jpg,20
Dance,"Review: William Forsythe Takes Dance to a Quiet, Uneven Place",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/13/arts/dance/william-forsythe-a-quiet-evening-of-dance-review.html,"One of the pleasures of a life filled with dance is the way, at the end of the day, a performance can force the mind to change course, to quiet down. William Forsythe's program at the Shed, ""A Quiet Evening of Dance,"" which opened on Friday, takes that to another level. Mr. Forsythe has created a setting -- not completely silent, but nice and hushed -- that encourages listening with both the ears and the eyes. The last thing you would want to hear under such conditions? A beep, buzz or, God forbid, the marimba ringtone. Putting our cellphones in airplane mode was the easy part ; more difficult was grasping the poetry of this two-act program. And that wasn't because of the sound or lack of it. Actually, it isn't completely quiet. The second half features a lively dance set to to Jean-Philippe Rameau, and in the first half, there are bird sounds and a spare composition by Morton Feldman. For the most part, though, it's up to the dancers to create the score with their steps and breathing, and for the audience to absorb it.

Certainly, there are moments to admire and respect. ""A Quiet Evening"" has the rigor that Mr. Forsythe always brings to the stage; there's just not enough transcendence. In part, that could have been because of an injury to a leading dancer, Christopher Roman. (Four others were brought on to fill in; during the curtain call, Mr. Forsythe said that they had learned their parts in three days.) But there is also a sameness to the material, and that makes the less experienced dancers stand out in an unfortunate way among the Forsythe veterans.

""A Quiet Evening,"" with new and reworked choreography by Mr. Forsythe, pays homage to ballet's European roots while attempting to bring it into the present. Mr. Forsythe is more than qualified for such a choreographic endeavor. An American based for many years in Germany, where he directed Frankfurt Ballet, he did much to guide ballet into a new era with his extreme take on classicism, paired with stark lighting and, frequently, the bold synthesized sounds of the composer Thom Willems.

The next phase of Mr. Forsythe's career landed him in a more experimental world of theater and dance; but recently, he's fallen back in love with ballet. While the Shed program affords the pleasure of becoming lost in his swirling, finely executed steps -- how did that hip end up there? -- taken as a whole, it starts to feel arid. And at times, the attempt to look at the future of ballet seems more contrived than organic, like the appearances of the street dancer Rauf Yasit. Also known as RubberLegz, he demonstrated the elasticity of his limbs with floor work that knotted him up like a pretzel, but as the night wore on, it seemed like we were seeing the same sequences on repeat. Chirping birds introduce Act 1, which begins with ""Prologue."" Parvaneh Scharafali and Ander Zabala, wearing evening gloves and sneakers covered with socks, perform a crisp, stately duet -- it's a labyrinth of limbs -- with joints as loose as soft spaghetti. (The socks over the sneakers remind me of the way figure skaters pull their tights over their boots -- not my favorite look.)

More intriguing is ""Catalogue,"" featuring the velvety dancing of Jill Johnson -- formerly a principal dancer with Ballet Frankfurt, she is still astonishing -- alongside the newcomer Brit Rodemund. Here, it's as if they are illustrating the development of ballet starting with simple shapes, some awkward, others pedestrian. This dance is in silence, which begins the moment they each extend an arm and touch palms. At the start, they draw invisible lines along the perimeter of their torsos with their hands. As they increase their force and expand spatially, the dancers' elbows and shoulders tell a tale of Mr. Forsythe's intense study of epaulement, or the carriage of the arms. Eventually their isolated movements morph into ballet steps and shapes. When their palms touch in the center once again, and the music -- Feldman's ""Nature Pieces From Piano No. 1"" -- starts, so does ""Epilogue,"" in which the cast of seven continues the story of some of Mr. Forsythe's most recognizable contributions to dance: his use of torque, speed, articulation and counterpoint. It's handsome in parts and confounding in others: Why include even a second of the ever-popular floss dance? Is it meant to be playful? It feels like a throwaway.

""Dialogue (DUO2015),"" the final piece in Act 1, pairs Brigel Gjoka and Riley Watts -- an extraordinary dancer with silky athleticism -- in a frisky duet of physical reverberations. This and ""Catalogue"" reveal much about Mr. Forsythe's lineage and achievements -- both spoke of scale and intimacy -- but as informative as the first half of ""A Quiet Evening"" is, it's also rambling. Steel yourself. If Act 1 is about revealing the raw ingredients that make up Mr. Forsythe's classicism, Act 2 is the meal in the form of a stand-alone dance: ""Seventeen/Twenty One,"" to Rameau's ""Hippolyte et Aricie: Ritournelle"" from ""Une Symphonie Imaginaire."" It explores ballet's evolution from the 17th century to the 21st, flooding the previously quiet space with full-bodied dancing and baroque music.

This is a dance, charming in moments, that is hungry for movement. By the end, it creates a sweet and simple sense of community -- a group of people just dancing together -- that comes to a joyful close as they suddenly clasp hands and run to the front of the stage for a bow. But the most consistent pleasure is from one dancer: Ms. Johnson brings an unassuming clarity and articulation to Mr. Forsythe's movement that feels like it comes from the deepest of places. All night long, her quiet radiance was the loudest thing in the room.

Theater,"Review: In 'Goodnight Nobody,' a Getaway Goes Awry",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/theater/goodnight-nobody-princeton-review.html,"PRINCETON -- One day, I'd like to see a dinner party onstage where everyone is still on good terms by dessert. Or a tragedy where the soothsayer's prophecy doesn't come true. Or a work presentation that goes off hitchless, a cross-dressing disguise that fools no one, a gun that misses.

Formulas work; that's why they became formulas in the first place. But they still need subverting.

""Goodnight Nobody,"" Rachel Bonds's restless, friable, finely acted play at the McCarter Theater here sometimes manages to distrupt old tropes, mostly because it feels like two shows carpentered together, with rough joints. It begins as a romantic tragedy, unfolds as a melancholy country-house comedy, then skitters back to tragedy again. I couldn't always tell where the play was going, which was invigorating. But I wasn't confident that Bonds, a nimble writer, and Tyne Rafaeli, her skilled director, knew either. It's about old secrets, new motherhood, art-making, sex-having, nature, nurture and mental illness. Let's put it this way: At one point, I had four of the five characters on suicide watch.

Haunted by Chekhov's ""The Seagull"" (consciously or otherwise), ""Goodnight Nobody,"" gathers a group of mostly artists at a lakeside retreat. Reggie (Nate Miller), a standup comedian in his 30s with substance abuse issues, has invited two old friends to an upstate farmhouse. Nandish (Saamer Usmani), who goes by Nan, is a painter with a troubled interior life and an apparent devotion to arm day at the gym. K (Ariel Woodiwiss) is a new mother with postpartum depression. (The script identifies her as a teacher, but the play never mentions her work, which seems odd or maybe telling.) They are joined by Mara (Dana Delany), Reggie's art-star sculptor mother, and Bo (Ken Marks), her painter boyfriend. Some people might pack Pictionary or fishing tackle for the weekend. Bo brings an ax.

Bonds has a talent for naturalism, and the chatter among the three friends crackles with lived experience and imaginative sympathy. As the mother of a preschooler, Bonds is beautifully specific about the isolation and occasional despair of young motherhood. (K describes herself as ""a fragmented zombie milk-person with a baby who I love like an animal, but who makes me so, so tired, like a thick, leaden, gray tired I have never felt."") But the revelation of acute mental illness feels stagy. And the conversations around visual art sound as empty as those conversations usually do. ""It impacted my whole being,"" Nan says of Mara's work.","Haunted by Chekhov's ""The Seagull,"" Rachel Bonds's restless and friable play gathers a group of mostly artists at a lakeside retreat.",18bb5084-09f4-5e74-83a7-5812cf683c00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/01/arts/27goodnight-nobody-1/27goodnight-nobody-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c2e3881b65a2c062495990cd6343da8af9d513349ac0fc9e1f1ff71184749409&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Nate Miller, Dana Delany, and Ariel Woodiwiss in Rachel Bonds&rsquo;s &ldquo;Goodnight Nobody,&rdquo; at the McCarter Theater in Princeton.",18bb5084-09f4-5e74-83a7-5812cf683c00,N24News/imgs/18bb5084-09f4-5e74-83a7-5812cf683c00.jpg,10
Art & Design,Ablaze With Art: Thriving Galleries in Lower Manhattan,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/arts/design/art-galleries-tribeca-lower-manhattan.html,"There are no surviving images of the 24 Afro-Brazilian figures -- some historical, some legendary -- who populate the paintings in Dalton Paula's ""A Kidnapper of Souls,"" his North American solo debut. (Mr. Paula, a Brazilian painter and multimedia artist who makes work about the African diaspora, did appear in the 2018 New Museum Triennial.) He modeled them, instead, after residents of a settlement originally founded by escaped slaves in the Brazilian state of Goias. Each figure, sensitively rendered in oil and gold leaf against a green or turquoise background -- a style inspired by turn-of-the-century portrait photography -- straddles a subtle lacuna: The 2-foot-by-18-inch panels they are painted on are made by screwing two narrow canvases together, and you can just make out the seam. It's an understated gesture that carries a lot of weight, bringing to mind not just the syncretic origins of Afro-Brazilian culture, or the continued fusion of those origins with contemporary Brazilian life, but also the enduring marks left by cleaving people away from their homes and families.

The conceptual artist Kayode Ojo continues to arrange found objects with a masterly touch in ""The Aviator,"" a sophomore show at Martos named after Martin Scorsese's 2004 biopic of Howard Hughes. A phoropter, the device optometrists use to determine a patient's prescription, hangs at eye level near the gallery entrance, at once a metaphor for art and art itself. (Let the artist shape your vision if you dare!) Or is it a comment about structural biases? Things only get more slippery as Mr. Ojo goes on to arrange prop handcuffs, chrome-plated music stands, replica pistols, open Swiss Army knives, and other tools with reflective surfaces in minimal but well-ordered piles. Because the placement of all these objects appear to be as significant as the items themselves, they all become terms in a single, all-encompassing visual language, supple and thought-provoking but endlessly ambiguous.

The inaugural group show at this new project space, founded by the artist Onyedika Chuke in his own basement art studio, is a powerful mix of explicit politics and formal verve. Three of Emory Douglas's graphic cover designs for the Black Panther newspaper remain as arresting as they were when he composed them 50 years ago. The Miami-based artist Yanira Collado contributes a spare, evocative sculpture reminiscent of a rooftop antenna, and a series of black-and-white photographs that document performances by Alicia Grullon are surprisingly striking in their own right. Two monumental works on paper -- one, by William Cordova, a polymath of patterns, features a grayscale check pattern, and the other, by the Houston artist Rick Lowe, has a tidal wave of black marker lines on a golden yellow ground -- are tacked directly to the walls, adding an extra burst of studio-visit excitement to an already energetic roundup.

A miniature is a refuge from the trials of real life, an otherworldly little kingdom you can enter with your eyes. But the palm-size landscapes in the ceramist Mary Carlson's ""Eden,"" most of them sourced from the peripheries of old master paintings, are different. ""Eden Trees (after Bruegel),"" a thick brown puddle of desert under a cluster of lumpy trees, is precisely rendered and shiny with glaze; ""Eden (after Cranach)"" features a trim little cave perfect for some tiny hermit; and in ""Reservoir Blue Hills,"" the only piece from life, the land is even more luscious blue than the water. Weaving around the low white pedestals that these nine little patches of paradise reside on, you may suspect that the Kingdom of Heaven, while surely at hand, is in need of some protection.

How would the world look if you could stand outside time? That's the heady question behind ""One Second Per Second,"" a lush but tightly focused suite of paintings by the young Brooklyn artist Dana Lok. In the largest two, ""Causal Wedge (Front)"" and ""Causal Wedge (Back),"" a veil of neon mist parts to reveal a single foot trampling through the mud. Simple orange butterflies -- perhaps a reference to the ""butterfly effect"" -- flutter around in the tall grass. Jagged receding borders at the top of this vision suggest that it's not just one instant Ms. Lok has her sights on, but a contiguous train of them. But what makes the concept work is that she doesn't linger over the details. It's just an uncommon way of highlighting what is, after all, the heart of most figurative painting -- the strange and magical problem of fixing a moment in time.

After finishing a body of work about the life and death cycle, the New York painter Megan Marrin, in need of some conceptual recovery, began researching spas and wellness. But she eventually narrowed her focus to a single emblematic object and put together a small but memorable show, ""Convalescence,"" comprising four ominous paintings of the Edwardian sanitarium fixture known as the rib cage shower. Filling their tall and narrow canvases more or less exactly, these devices look like skeletons -- almost alien but weirdly familiar -- in cross-sections of shadowy flesh. They bring to mind all sorts of disquieting questions about luxury, technology and the sexual undercurrents of the industrial world. Do we shape our environment or does it shape us? Is the desire for comfort a product of the death drive? And just what are we after, anyway, when we design a bathroom? The paintings' bilious colors and sticky-looking surfaces only amplify their psychological effect.","Will Heinrich heads to TriBeCa, where new galleries keep popping up and strong shows abound.",911f985d-1f68-5ad4-b04e-45a3ac2bb616,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/16/arts/15tribeca-roundupc/15tribeca-roundupc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=22fad1698fd92330f4ce7e41fc6450b7d1bbe1952a780e73747d9e1e4b40b8c2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An installation view of some of the new works in Dana Lok's exhibition ""One Second Per Second"" at Page (NYC) gallery.",911f985d-1f68-5ad4-b04e-45a3ac2bb616,N24News/imgs/911f985d-1f68-5ad4-b04e-45a3ac2bb616.jpg,14
Media,"As the World Heats Up, the Climate for News Is Changing, Too",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/08/business/media/as-the-world-heats-up-the-climate-for-news-is-changing-too.html,"As the World Heats Up, the Climate for News Is Changing, Too

As Europe heats up, Greenland melts and the Midwest floods, many news organizations are devoting more resources to climate change as they cover the topic with more urgency. In Florida, six newsrooms with different owners have taken the unusual step of pooling their resources and sharing their reporting on the issue. They plan to examine how climate change will affect the state's enormous agriculture sector as well as ""the future of coastal towns and cities -- which ones survive, which ones go under,"" according to a statement released when the initiative was announced last month. Florida's record-breaking heat waves, devastating storms like Hurricane Michael and increased flooding at high tide have not been lost on Mindy Marques, the publisher and executive editor of The Miami Herald, one of the six organizations taking part in the effort. ""It's undeniable that we are living with the impact of changes in our climate every day,"" Ms. Marques said.

The Guardian, the left-wing British daily, recently updated its house style to prefer the phrase ""climate emergency"" over ""climate change."" It also recommends ""climate science denier"" in place of ""climate skeptic."" The publication has also started listing the global carbon dioxide level on its daily weather page. The New York Times established a desk dedicated to climate change in 2017, with editors and reporters in Washington and New York who collaborate with bureaus around the world. But even among journalists who want to convey that climate change is a crisis, there is not unanimity about how to play it.

Matthew C. Nisbet, a communications professor at Northeastern University and the editor of the journal Environmental Communication, has argued for more nuance. ""We have good research that in amping up the threat without actually providing people with things they can do, you end up with fatalism, despair, depression, a sense of paralysis, or a sense of dismissiveness and denial,"" he said. Mr. Nisbet, who recently published an article headlined ""The Trouble With Climate Emergency Journalism"" in the journal Issues in Science and Technology, warned that fever-pitch coverage could make climate science go the way of dietary science, a discipline that has suffered, in his view, from credulous reports of new studies that regularly upend conventional wisdom -- fat is bad; no, carbs are bad; no, eat like a cave man. ""People don't know what to believe,"" Mr. Nisbet said. ""They lose trust in the science and in the journalism about the science, and the complexity of the issue is lost."" David Wallace-Wells, the deputy editor of New York magazine whose work has appeared in The Times, argued the contrary, saying that a dash of alarmism suits alarming developments.

Barely a year after the kerfuffle around that article, a panel of scientists convened by the United Nations issued a dire report, which forecast severe climate change as soon as 2040. To describe it, some news organizations pressed the panic button, a la The Guardian: ""We Have 12 Years to Limit Climate Change Catastrophe, Warns U.N."" (Mr. Wallace-Wells's contribution was headlined: ""U.N. Says Climate Genocide Is Coming. It's Actually Worse Than That."") But even those that played it straight could not help but convey urgency. ""U.N. Report: 'Unprecedented Changes' Needed to Protect Earth From Global Warming,"" went the USA Today headline. 1. Time for action is running out. The major agreement struck by diplomats established a clear consensus that all nations need to do much more, immediately, to prevent a catastrophic rise in global temperatures. 2. How much each nation needs to cut remains unresolved. Rich countries are disproportionately responsible for global warming, but some leaders have insisted that it's the poorer nations who need to accelerate their shift away from fossil fuels. 3. The call for disaster aid increased. One of the biggest fights at the summit revolved around whether -- and how -- the world's wealthiest nations should compensate poorer nations for the damage caused by rising temperatures. 4. A surprising emissions-cutting agreement. Among the other notable deals to come out of the summit was a U.S.-China agreement to do more to cut emissions this decade, and China committed for the first time to develop a plan to reduce methane. 5. There was a clear gender and generation gap. Those with the power to make decisions about how much the world warms were mostly old and male. Those who were most fiercely protesting the pace of action were mostly young and female. Other outlets held off, however, with 28 of the top 50 American newspapers by Sunday circulation publishing nothing on the report the day after it was issued, according to the liberal watchdog Media Matters for America. The Columbia Journalism Review bashed the nonchalant response to the United Nations report in an April 22 essay headlined ""The media are complacent while the world burns."" Written by the longtime environmental reporter Mark Hertsgaard and the magazine's top editor, Kyle Pope, the piece, which was also published in The Nation and The Guardian, took issue with the ""climate silence"" of major news organizations and singled out the paucity of time given to the issue on television news, ""where the brutal demands of ratings and money work against adequate coverage of the biggest story of our time."" An illustration of the extremes in how climate change has been covered was evident on a recent edition of the nightly Fox News program ""The Story With Martha MacCallum."" The segment began with a clip from John Oliver's HBO show in which Bill Nye the Science Guy, a winner of multiple Emmys who specializes in explaining scientific concepts in simple terms, lit a globe on fire and ordered his viewers, in unprintable language, to grow up and face the crisis. After the clip played, Ms. MacCallum's guest, the Fox News personality Jesse Watters, weighed in.

Mr. Watters's view lines up with the roughly one-third of Americans who believe that climate change is mostly due to natural trends, according to a new study from the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication. It is also in keeping with the opinion of Mr. Watters's onetime dining partner President Trump, who pulled the United States out of the Paris climate accord and has called the idea that climate change results from human activity a ""hoax"" and ""fake science."" At the other end of the spectrum, the activists of Extinction Rebellion, a group founded in Britain last year, argue that most journalists have not met the crisis with sufficient urgency. In addition to recent protests in London and Paris (where some participants were tear-gassed), the group has aimed at the news media, with demonstrations last month outside the offices of The New York Times, The Washington Post and Fox News. ""You're still not talking about it like it's an emergency,"" said a group spokeswoman, Alanna Byrne, referring to large media outlets, ""and that's what we have to do now: Be honest to the public about the full-scale changes we have to make."" On April 30, The Columbia Journalism Review and The Nation sponsored a town hall on how to cover climate change as part of an initiative called Covering Climate Now. It has brought together Asahi Shimbun, a Japanese newspaper; Maclean's magazine of Canada; The Philadelphia Inquirer; and other outlets that have pledged to step up coverage of the issue before a United Nations climate summit scheduled for September. ""It's outdated to say that covering the effects of climate change is advocacy,"" said Mr. Pope, the Columbia Journalism Review editor. ""It's an enormous story. The effects of this are completely nonpartisan.""",Rival newsrooms are joining together to meet a crisis years in the making.

Music,Callas and Aretha: The Week in Classical Music,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/arts/music/callas-and-aretha-the-week-in-classical-music.html,"On offer are tremendous voices. We hear Callas sing ""Ah! non credea"" from Bellini's ""La Sonnambula,"" rapt in hurt. We hear Franklin close with ""Never Grow Old,"" her tone focused, her phrasing transcendently free. In both films, passing details that bring these giants to human life are what catch your heart: Aretha putting on her makeup before going on the second night; her clasping the Rev. James Cleveland's hand behind her back while she sings; a jokey glance from Callas as she walks backstage; blurry fragments of Bellini's ""Norma""; the charmingly fervent testimonials from young gays waiting hours outside for tickets for her return to the Met in 1965. (No, I don't know they're gay, but come on.)

The baritone Mariusz Kwiecien, an audience favorite at the Metropolitan Opera, fell ill during the opening night of Bizet's ""The Pearl Fishers,"" and had to pull out after the first act; his understudy, the baritone Alexander Birch Elliot, stepped in. As my colleague Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim reported, during the fraught scene when Zurga chews over his longtime friend Nadir's betrayal, Mr. Elliott ""tore into the music with heated intensity,"" winning cheers. Mr. Kwiecien eventually withdrew from the remainder of the run, and I heard Mr. Elliott in a complete performance on Wednesday. This 32-year-old South Carolina native made a strong impression in an exceptional cast featuring Javier Camarena and Pretty Yende. His virile singing had rich colorings in softer passages and ringing top notes. Handsome and a good actor, he seems set to go. Here he is, not that long ago, singing Figaro's signature aria from ""The Barber of Seville"" with a pianist in a studio at the Portland Opera. Even in this modest setting, Mr. Elliott's robust voice and playful swagger come through. ANTHONY TOMMASINI

I wish I could tell you about the music at Anthony Roth Costanzo's recital-extravaganza ""Glass Handel,"" but I didn't hear any of it clearly until the final song. There were three sections inside the Cathedral of St. John the Divine devoted to the event: one with a screen for music videos (by the likes of James Ivory and Tilda Swinton); one with a platform for dancers (performing choreography by Justin Peck); and another with a screen upon which George Condo painted live and a stage for the ensemble the Knights and Mr. Costanzo, wearing costumes by Raf Simons. Whew. A small army of assistants picked up seated audience members with dollies to wheel them from area to area. But on Monday, the only vantage point that offered acceptable acoustics was the one directly in front of the stage, where I ended up, at last, for Philip Glass's electrifying ""The Encounter."" Elsewhere, Mr. Costanzo's voice was a tad too thin to penetrate the orchestra and fill the cavernous space. Not that music seemed to be really the point of ""Glass Handel."" It wasn't about an insightful juxtaposition of works by two composers at opposite ends of the countertenor repertory (though that comes through more cogently on Mr. Costanzo's recent album ""ARC,"" which you can stream with each track's accompanying music video on iTunes). But it was a major event -- self-consciously so, with a playbill full of hashtags and social media handles. It was as if the space had been double booked for a concert and a Fashion Week show; the scene was chaotic, and no single element, not even the singing, stood out amid the spectacle.

Though I was impressed by the creativity, collaborative effort and sheer audacity of ""Glass Handel,"" I found the mix of elements somewhat arbitrary. The piece never quite came together. It was like a three-ring circus, with the surreally costumed Mr. Costanzo, backed by the Knights (conducted by Eric Jacobson) singing on a central platform; four dynamic dancers off to one side; and a screen showing music videos off to the other. During the performance, patrons were moved -- actually lifted up in their seats -- from once section to others. I sort of enjoyed the ride, but was never placed particularly close to Mr. Costanzo and the orchestra, which was frustrating. I get a better sense of the musical resonances he detects between Glass and Handel from his singing on his new recording. Here, for example, he sings ""The Encounter"" from Mr. Glass's 1988 melodrama ""1000 Airplanes on the Roof."" ANTHONY TOMMASINI

One of the newest arrivals to the growing ranks of exciting countertenors is the Polish-born, Juilliard-trained Jakub Jozef Orlinski, who turns 28 next week. A year ago he impressed me with a melting performance of Paola Prestini's ""Prelude and Aria"" (from her opera ""Gilgamesh"") with the American Composers Orchestra. This spring at Carnegie Hall, in more standard repertory, he was splendid as Eustazio in a concert performance of Handel's ""Rinaldo."" It turns out this charismatic singer is an accomplished break dancer! He is also an inquisitive musician whose latest, very fine Erato recording, ""Anima Sacra,"" presents a program of Baroque sacred arias by little-known composers, including Nicola Fago and Domenico Sarro, all touted as premiere recordings. Listen to Mr. Orlinski in Fago's sublime ""Tam non splendet sol creatus.""

Theater,Review: Carey Mulligan Tells a Harrowing Tale of 'Girls & Boys',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/theater/girls-and-boys-review-carey-mulligan.html,"The woman with the raw, luminous face has a story she wants to tell you. No, that's not quite right. It's a story she has to tell you, though the hard urgency of her narrative won't be obvious at first. It is obvious she'll deploy all the tools at her command -- charm, aggression, the illusion of immediate intimacy -- to keep your attention. Because this woman is portrayed with unswerving focus by Carey Mulligan, one of the most compelling stage actresses of her generation, there is never any question of her not succeeding in this mission. For the more than 100 uninterrupted minutes that make up Dennis Kelly's ""Girls & Boys,"" in which Ms. Mulligan is the entire cast, you are unconditionally hers. This is true even when you start to suspect that there is both more -- and, fatally, less -- to her character's story than meets the eye. Afterward, when you're out of the coercive range of Ms. Mulligan's gaze, you'll find yourself thinking that Mr. Kelly is one lucky playwright to have had her as his interpreter. [Read about Carey Mulligan, facing the fear of being alone onstage ] [Sign up for Theater Update here.]

""Girls & Boys,"" which opened on Wednesday night at the Minetta Lane Theater under the seamless direction of Lyndsey Turner, is a dark tease of a tale that never quite rises to its own, earnest ambitions. Despite its anodyne title, ""Girls & Boys"" considers the relationship between the sexes to explore the ways in which each is wired to create and destroy. Or as Woman (that's how Ms. Mulligan's character is identified in the program) says, ""I think a lot about violence."" She continues, ""I just think it's such a fundamental part of our species that how can you understand us without understanding it?"" There are reasons, needless to say, that she poses this question, including one of devastating relevance to her. Woman has done her research, and she conversationally folds in evidence that is academic as well as anecdotal, sociological as well as personal. Somehow, though, the answers never add up, nor do the details that convincingly define a life torn asunder. Mr. Kelly -- best known here for his impeccably quirky, Tony-winning book for the musical ""Matilda"" -- has written a careful and intelligent script that covers many bases but lands on few of them with full impact. It begins as a fond portrait of a love affair and ends as a cold assessment of a tragedy, while implicitly wondering how one might have led to the other. Ms. Mulligan's character is a documentary maker and mother of two who describes the signal events of her adult life with a bright candor that she has clearly learned suits her. This comes across in both her account of how she won a hotly coveted job in television without much in the way of a resume or experience and of how she met and fell for the man who would become her supportive husband.

These aspects of her life are described directly to the audience as Ms. Mulligan stands on an empty stage with nothing but her expressive frame and face to define the busy world she is conjuring. These scenes alternate with others in which she is dealing with the often tedious demands of her two young children, Leanne and Danny. But while Es Devlin's superb set, delicately lighted by Oliver Fenwick, has shifted to reveal a completely detailed living area, rendered in monochrome, Ms. Mulligan is again called upon to fill in blanks. Though Woman's children are never seen, she tends to them with a present-tense and vividly precise physicality. And in the play's most chilling moment, as her character is balancing her attentions between a little boy who wants to play war and a girl who wants to play architect, Ms. Mulligan looks at us and says matter-of-factly, ""I know they're not here."" That the boy is instinctively military, while the girl is drawn to more constructive and intellectual pursuits, posits a gender-based contrast in sensibilities. So does Woman's account of a documentary she worked on, about an academic who basically theorizes that women should be running the world. That theorist, by the way, is as a man. And the account of his behavior while collaborating on the documentary is evidence of Mr. Kelly's welcome refusal to present any argument in pure black and white. This is also true of Woman's account of what led to the terrible events at the play's center. Yet it is in this most crucial, central story that the script falters, lapsing into the conventions of true crime shows and police procedurals in which a forensic expert tries to explain imponderable acts. Not that you'll be entirely conscious of this failing while you're watching Ms. Mulligan, though it may quietly nag at you.

The 1903 Blue Period pastel of a dark-haired, unsmiling woman -- her identity is unknown -- is one of at least 16 masterpieces that the banker Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy sold in the months after the Nazis seized power and before his death in 1935.

A relative of the famous composer Felix Mendelssohn and the Enlightenment philosopher Moses Mendelssohn, Mendelssohn-Bartholdy was ousted from the Central Association of German Banks and Bankers in 1933 and from the board of the Reich Insurance Office in 1934. The family bank was ""aryanised"" -- transferred to non-Jewish ownership -- in 1938.

""Head of a Woman"" was sold to the dealer Justin K. Thannhauser in 1934.

Science,Volcanoes Helped Violent Revolts Erupt in Ancient Egypt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/science/volcanoes-ancient-egypt-revolts.html,"The Ptolemaic Kingdom was a prosperous time in Egypt's ancient history, nearly three centuries from 305 B.C. to 30 B.C. that saw the reign of Queen Cleopatra VII and the construction of the Great Library and the Lighthouse of Alexandria. But during the period there were also several bloody Egyptian revolts against the ruling Greeks. Now, a team of historians and climate scientists say in a study published Tuesday that the unrest and uprisings may have been tied to volcanic eruptions that triggered climatic changes. Eruptions across the globe may have suppressed monsoons, the scientists said, diminishing the annual river floods and leading to food shortages. Because 70 percent of the world's population today similarly relies on monsoon-dependent agricultural systems, the findings may warn of what might happen in a volcanically active future. Today, humanity lives during a relatively quiet volcanic period. The largest eruption to affect the climate in recent memory was the 1991 Pinatubo event in the Philippines. But things were much different during the Ptolemaic era.

""They were unfortunate. They were living in a period where the Nile had extra variability because of these eruptions."" When powerful volcanoes erupt, they spew ash and sulfur high into the stratosphere. There, the sulfur oxidizes into sulfate aerosols that reflect sunlight back to space, reducing evaporation on the planet's surface. As less water is absorbed into the clouds, less rain falls into seas and lakes. And if a volcano erupts in the Northern Hemisphere, especially at high latitudes, the cooling effect may tamper with the summertime heating that controls monsoon winds over Africa.

When rainfall is reduced and monsoons are suppressed, the Nile fails to flood as usual, starving the crops that depend on its water. ""We guess there was a lot of fear when the Egyptians see the Nile not flooding that year,"" said Joseph Manning, a historian from Yale and co-author on the study. ""There was fear about what's going to happen. 'Are we going to starve like last time when there was no flood three years in a row?'"" That fear could have fueled riots. But to establish a connection between volcanoes and revolts in ancient Egypt, the team first had to determine the dates for when the volcanoes erupted.

They did that by looking at ice core data from Greenland and Antarctica, which contain trapped sulfur from ancient volcanic eruptions. The scientists then turned to papyrus records to figure out when the Nile River failed to flood as usual. But the records from the Ptolemaic period were all qualitative, not quantitative. So the team turned to the Nilometer record, which contains measurements taken by large instruments built during Egypt's early Islamic period to monitor the Nile River's annual flood level. The researchers used the data from the Nilometer record to gain measurements from 622 A.D. to 1902 A.D., and identified 60 eruptions between those years. On average the Nile flood level was nearly nine inches lower during eruption years, the team discovered.

This suggested a pattern that may have existed during the Ptolemaic Period, as well. After confirming a link between volcanic eruptions and poor Nile flooding, the team then matched the dates of Ptolemaic eruptions with papyrus records of well-known rebellions. They found that eight of ten large uprisings happened within two years of a volcanic eruption. The biggest of these, the 20-year Theban revolt, began in 207 B.C., followed a large tropical eruption two years earlier. A papyrus report from this time indicated that most of the farmers were killed and the land had gone dry. In their paper, the researchers were careful to clarify that volcanoes alone were not the cause of Egyptian revolts. Rather, the natural disasters set off a reaction that mixed other ingredients -- like heavy taxation, ethnic conflict and disease -- to incite social unrest.

""You have all of these things coalescing at a time, and you can imagine it's a powder keg,"" said Dr. Ludlow. ""All of it puts a strain on the social system and can just ignite into revolt against the Ptolemaic Greek elites."" Not every eruption in that period was linked to a revolt. The river failed to flood in the years following massive eruptions in 46 and 44 B.C. during Cleopatra's reign, but her food allocation policies may have helped avert uprisings. Kyle Harper, a professor of classics at the University of Oklahoma who has studied environmental change and the fall of the Roman Empire, said the new paper was compelling and that it showed a strong link between volcanic forces and their effects on the Nile River. He added that he would like to see if the analysis could be extended to Egypt's Roman and early Islamic periods.","During the Ptolemaic Period, fluctuations in Nile flooding triggered by eruptions may have led to violent uprisings, researchers report.",745de46e-0347-5922-b530-aa1c35733227,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/31/science/18TB-EGYPTVOLCANO/18TB-EGYPTVOLCANO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=48af3493f4c964368970387d090faf48800be82e3dc5bda336e28af36c04405b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A harvest scene at the tomb of Petosiris, a high priest of Thoth, at Tuna el-Gebel, Egypt, from the Ptolemaic era.

Health,"Vaccinations Bring Hope, Bracelets Deliver Reminders",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/25/health/vaccinations-bring-hope-bracelets-deliver-reminders.html,"Because of the vaccine alliance Gavi, United Nations agencies, the World Bank, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and other donors, immunizations have soared in developing countries over the last 15 years. As a result, an estimated seven million children have survived infancy who before the year 2000 would have died young.

But vaccine schedules are increasingly complex, and young mothers often forget to take children in for shots on time.

A clever solution occurred to Lauren Braun, a former Cornell pre-med student, when she spent a summer working in Peru, traveling to villages to remind mothers to take children to clinics for immunizations.

Her nonprofit company, Alma Sana, makes flexible silicon bracelets -- like the yellow Livestrong bands so popular a decade ago.

Art & Design,"Unnamed, Art Deco Steps Out With Plenty of Company in 'The Jazz Age'",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/arts/design/unnamed-art-deco-steps-out-with-plenty-of-company-in-the-jazz-age.html,"The names Cartier, Lalique, Ruhlmann and Puiforcat flit among the labels at the Cooper Hewitt. Streamlined curves alternate with chunky geometries. Skyscraper motifs abound. New overtakes old in furniture, jewelry, ironwork, bead-encrusted evening gowns and opera capes, tapestries and lacquered folding screens, silver tea services and cigarette cases. During the heady, blinkered years known as the Roaring Twenties, modernization was in the air, as was a pervasive sense of instability. In that brief recovery from World War I, before the slide into the economic and political upheavals that led to World War II, Art Deco was born -- the best known of all modern art movements.

Which ""The Jazz Age"" surely does, if in a flawed, unbalanced way. It sets out to survey the amazing plethora of progressive European trends that helped jump-start American design in the 1920s: the more austere styles emerging from the German Bauhaus, the Dutch de Stijl movement and Scandinavia, as well as those from Vienna, where European modern design coalesced, opulently, at the turn of the century. These influences were absorbed by Americans traveling abroad, especially to the immense international design exhibition staged in Paris in 1925, the Exposition International des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes (whence Art Deco distilled its name). They were fomented at home by museum exhibitions, department stores, collectors, designers and the shops of the Wiener Werkstatte in Vienna and Cartier in Paris that opened in New York.

Against Europe's embarrassment of design riches, this exhibition posits an American achievement of equal importance: jazz and -- less prominently -- the blues, the African-American musical forms that are our first truly viral contribution to international modernism. Jazz, especially, provided the decade's soundtrack, helped speed up its metabolism and relax its social mores. The show includes black artists who aided or reflected jazz's popularity, including the ingenious Josephine Baker, queen of Paris, seen in film, photography and the work of the illustrator Paul Colin, and the painter Archibald J. Motley Jr., who excelled at depicting people dancing, with new intimacy, to the new music. Less visible than jazz, but equally important, is the role played by foreign designers. Some worked from Europe, like the Russian polymath Leon Bakst, who created a black fabric gridded with flower garlands for the Robinson Silk Company in New York. But most relocated to the United States after World War I, influencing American taste and talent and, more specifically, providing American companies with designs to produce: among them were Paul T. Frankl, William Hunt Diederich, Kem Weber and Elsa Tennhardt.

Both ""The Jazz Age"" and its catalog were overseen by Sarah D. Coffin, a curator at the Cooper Hewitt, and Stephen Harrison, from the Cleveland Museum of Art, the collaborating institution on the show, with assistance from Emily M. Orr. It brings together the two museums' deep holdings in American design for the first time, providing plenty to look at, much of it visually and historically fascinating. The exhibition, which opens on the museum's third floor and spills over onto the second, starts quietly, almost in reverse. ""The Persistence of Good Taste,"" the first of its six sections, features a handful of 20th-century reproductions of bygone styles, including a handsome Regency-style tea service and a painted blanket chest by Max Kuehne that once belonged to the wife of the American collector Albert C. Barnes. From here the extravagance and craftsmanship of high-end Art Deco, and its accompanying social obliviousness, is prominent. In ""A New Look for Familiar Forms"" we encounter the exquisite custom-made cabinetry of Jacques-Emile Ruhlmann and a majestic gondola sofa by Marcel Coard, its cradling curve of base and arms made from rosewood carved to simulate rattan and edged in brass.

A section ""Bending the Rules"" features the gleaming fripperies of an exciting if quite expensive night life. A French brooch shaped like a bow-tie is made of carved lapis, onyx, coral and jade. A pair of cuff bracelets in diamonds and platinum were once worn daily by Gloria Swanson. Bejeweled cigarette cases and holders remind us that women not only got the right to vote in the 1920s, they also began to smoke in public. Donald Deskey's ""Party Ashtray"" is a lively pastel study for wallpaper strewn with lighted cigarettes that evokes paintings by Katherine Bernhardt.

That African-American culture, while appreciated, was also caricatured, is evident in the dancing figures on glass vases by the Italian designer Guido Maria Balsamo Stella and a Paul Colin drawing of a sprightly couple in which the male partner might be in blackface. As if on cue, a cigarette case once owned by Al Jolson -- the American exemplar of the genre -- mimics a letter, with his name and address scrawled on its lid. ""A Smaller World,"" which continues on the second floor, strikes a less harmonious chord. The skyscraper motif dominates, by turn lumbering, in the heavy wood furniture forms of Frankl; amateurish, in a silver folding screen by Deskey; and jokey, in a cut-metal chair designed for Macy's by the eminent lamp designer Walter von Nessen. The city's energy is most acute in a tiny mural study by the German-born American artist Winold Reiss that could be the work of Pop Art's Roy Lichtenstein.

The third floor finally turns to furniture (and paintings) of a decidedly non-Deco ilk, in ""Abstraction and Invention."" A Mondrian abstraction is paired with Gerrit Rietveld's ""Red, Yellow and Blue Chair"" -- both classics, and an excellent Eiffel Tower painting by Robert Delaunay pits its wheeling space against the rigid verticality of Frank Lloyd Wright's ""Peacock"" chair. The sixth section, awkwardly titled ""Towards a Machine Age and Looking Forward,"" is given over to the sleek styling of the essentialist International Style. It features the pioneering chrome-tube furniture by the European Bauhaus modernists Marcel Breuer, Mies van der Rohe as well as Le Corbusier, as well as its less imposing repercussions among American designers. Within view of a photograph of the Spirit of St. Louis approaching Paris in 1927, a bed with built-in cabinets in honey-colored wood by the Austrian emigre Frederick Kiesler suggests an airliner's first-class cabin. Above it hangs Aaron Douglas's imposing ""Go Down Death,"" a painting of a ghostly horse and winged rider tearing through star-shaped clouds. Based on one of Douglas's illustrations for James Weldon Johnson's 1927 book of poetry, ""God's Trombones,"" it was made in 1934. The Depression had come; Hitler was in power. Things were headed every which way but up. But the 1920s and the style that must not be named have one last, lavish hurrah in Part 2 of ""A Smaller World"" on the museum's second floor. That style's brilliance, hauteur and occasional kitsch return in force, in sparkling European objects and garments shown at the Paris exposition in 1925 or elsewhere on the Continent. Arguably the best part of the show, this array suggests that America rarely mustered an Art Deco worthy of the name -- making it invaluable to remind us of the other influences shaping the country's design ethos. Also invigorating is the idea that stylistic definitions are always profoundly porous when looked at in the light of day. Still, it is fair to wager that Art Deco's three little syllables will probably remain in use.",A show at Cooper Hewitt about American design in the 1920s gets its punch from works that exemplify an art movement that goes unmentioned.,ba93843c-5821-5d80-869a-09328d8b9f1b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/07/arts/07jazzage1/07jazzage1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=695d0c01ac1b805c0707850ba50ff6c1b6f5292f20f8f7119f71bfb05171021d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A gondola sofa designed by Marcel Coard around 1925 in ""The Jazz Age: American Style in the 1920s"" at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum.

Media,'A Big Correction': Pandemic Brings Change to 'Bloated' Ad Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/business/media/coronavirus-pandemic-advertising-industry.html,"A Chipotle ad was shot in Idaho at ""a fraction of what a full-blown production would have cost,"" according to its chief marketing officer.





The advertising industry's tendency toward excess -- catered parties in Las Vegas headlined by pop stars; unwieldy internal hierarchies stuffed with countless director roles; throw-it-at-the-wall ad placement -- has persisted for years despite concerns about wastefulness. The pandemic may force all of that to change. Some people in the industry say a correction was necessary. Marketing budgets have dwindled as the coronavirus led to nationwide lockdowns and canceled events, and customers are no longer in the mood for flashy TV commercials or bright, cheerful billboards. The research firm Forrester predicted last week that advertising spending in the United States would decline by 25 percent this year and would not recover until 2023. For Twitter, advertising revenue fell 23 percent in the most recent quarter. Now the platform has said it is looking into subscriptions and other ways to make money that do not depend on ads. The ad giant Omnicom Group said on Tuesday that revenue in its second quarter slumped nearly 25 percent and that the decline ""is expected to continue for the remainder of the year."" Like many of its peers, it laid off 6,100 employees, shed more than 1 million square feet of space, froze hiring and implemented some pay cuts.

In place of the pre-pandemic parties and dinners, the longtime advertising executive Gaston Legorburu has been going ""from war room to war room"" at Fortune 500 companies, where he said he found many advertising plans and marketing departments in limbo. His agency, Glue IQ, has placed interim workers at companies that have cut back their staffs. ""There's a big correction -- a lot of these teams have gotten too big and too bloated,"" he said. ""They're now having the realization that they can do twice as much with half as many people.""

While the industry tightens, the ads it produces have become simpler and more practical. Campaigns are often produced quickly and on the cheap as companies have tried to adjust to the initial shock of lockdown, worldwide civil rights protests and the seesaw of reopenings that have sometimes been interrupted by new outbreaks. More clients have asked that their ads be made by and feature a more diverse group of people, while also demanding more evidence that the ads are effective. Agencies have experimented with digital tools to help brands stay relevant, such as a ""tension map"" that analyzes online conversations around the country.

""This is an industry that is constantly talking about wanting to transform itself, but that is also constantly sticking to very traditional approaches,"" said Marcelo Pascoa, the vice president for marketing for the beer brand Coors. ""Old habits die hard, but people are being forced out of necessity to adapt faster."" In 2020 and 2021, agencies will shed 52,000 jobs, according to Jay Pattisall, an analyst with Forrester. Half the jobs will not return, he predicted. Last week, the agency Wieden & Kennedy laid off 11 percent of its work force, citing ""an impasse"" with the pandemic. Havas, another large ad company that laid off employees, said that recovering ""will undoubtedly take more time than hoped.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""There will be fewer and smaller agencies that are just as capable, if not more capable, because they'll lean on technology for basic tasks -- like a bot that takes notes for you during a call, that processes the paperwork to hire an influencer for a campaign, or does audience analysis for a media planner,"" Mr. Pattisall said. Other work may go to part-time contractors, as companies seek flexibility, said Kenny Tomlin, who recently co-founded the digital agency CourtAvenue. Mr. Tomlin has helped connect Fortune 100 brands with ""pre-tired"" marketing professionals -- workers who are on the cusp of retirement but still want occasional work. ""There are a lot of client engagements right now that are project-based, where they don't want to sign multiyear retainment agreements, and they don't know what their long-term budgets are,"" Mr. Tomlin said.

The pandemic and the Black Lives Matter protests have forced many companies to take a hard look at their marketing strategies. Visa said this month, during what it called ""a time of great introspection and change,"" that it would take bids from ad agencies hoping to become its go-to creative partner. The company, which spent $235 million on marketing in the first quarter of 2020, said it would consider candidates' commitment to diversity in its review.

Coca-Cola is also ""reassessing our overall marketing return on investment on everything from ad viewership across traditional media to improving effectiveness in digital,"" James Quincey, the chief executive, said during a conference call last week. The company will ""be judicious in our use of marketing,"" he added, as it tries to track changes in regional lockdown policies. But there are reasons for optimism. Dentsu, a major advertising holding company, has returned some agency employees to full shifts after moving them to reduced schedules. At the advertising and communications giant WPP, which has had more than 100,000 employees working from home for months, new business plunged early in the pandemic but has since recovered to early 2020 levels. WPP and the rest of the country have ""seen decades of innovation in a few short months,"" said its chief executive, Mark Read. Live sports, a magnet for advertising, may be on their way back, with the National Basketball Association season scheduled to restart July 30 and the National Hockey League set to return Aug. 1. Ad space attached to four games that helped usher in the Major League Baseball season on Saturday quickly sold out, according to Fox Sports. More than 60 advertisers, such as Hankook Tire and Bud Light, participated. But that space may be at risk: More than a dozen Miami Marlins players and coaches have tested positive for the coronavirus after this weekend's games, putting the rest of the shortened season in doubt. Derek Andersen, the chief financial officer of Snap, warned on a conference call last week that the demand for ads in the third quarter of the year had ""historically been bolstered by factors that appear unlikely to materialize in the same way they have in prior years, including the back-to-school season, film release schedules, and the operations of various sports leagues."" The uncertainty has provided a challenge to an industry that tried to gauge the national mood. ""The consumer psyche and what they wanted to hear and needed to hear from brands would just change week to week,"" said Chris Brandt, the chief marketing officer of Chipotle.",The marketing business is going through a period of innovation as it sheds workers and tries to hold on to clients.,2c6f49de-21b4-5003-b2af-1f306aae161e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/business/28Virus-Advertising-01/merlin_175000356_bbbf32ca-f875-4a75-9616-75f400e80a9e-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=35cd55bfbb20fb7b555393dc64abf10318991e113ddcd53f5d53ff4ebeabd92b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Chipotle ad was shot in Idaho at &ldquo;a fraction of what a full-blown production would have cost,&rdquo; according to its chief marketing officer.",2c6f49de-21b4-5003-b2af-1f306aae161e,N24News/imgs/2c6f49de-21b4-5003-b2af-1f306aae161e.jpg,16
Fashion & Style,Sterling Ruby's Art-Driven (and Autobiographical) Clothing Line,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/fashion/sterling-ruby-pitti-uomo-florence-italy.html,"FLORENCE, Italy -- ""Fifteen minutes ago, I may not have been about to say that,"" the multidisciplinary art star Sterling Ruby said backstage just after the stellar debut of his fashion label S.R. Studio. L.A. CA. He was referring to the prospects of adding ""designer"" to the list of occupations on his already jam-packed resume. ""But I really enjoyed it,"" Mr. Ruby said of the pressure to produce, after a yearlong gestation, a first collection that was so dense with ideas it felt like several collections mashed up on a single runway.

Mr. Ruby was the special guest designer at Pitti Uomo, the big men's wear trade fair, a distinction previously experienced by Virgil Abloh, now the men's wear director at Louis Vuitton. This time Mr. Abloh had flown from his label's headquarters in Paris to join a front row studded with heavy-hitting art collectors, some of whom had also jetted in, on private aircraft, from Switzerland where they had been attending that other giant trade fair, Art Basel.

It was heady stuff for a first-time designer. And yet, notwithstanding his impressive client base and apex predator status in the art world, Mr. Ruby spent the moments before the show fussing backstage with the drape of a bulky sweater that looked as if it had been knitted by a Cyclops and also wielding a lint roller. ""I'm a little manic,"" said the artist, whose practice has encompassed not only the post-apocalyptic ceramic vessels on which he made his reputation, but soft sculptures, design collaborations with Raf Simons (the two are close friends) at Dior and Calvin Klein and a photographic series documenting maximum security prisons across the United States from the air. The scale of his studio in the gritty industrial bowels of Los Angeles gives some sense of the scope of Mr. Ruby's ambition. It covers 120,000 square feet spread across nearly four acres. Born on a United States military base in Bitburg, Germany, Mr. Ruby, now 47, moved in his youth to Baltimore and then to rural New Freedom, Pa., in those days at the heart of Amish country. He was a diffident student, an outsider in a place he has often referred to as the middle of nowhere. He worked in construction and harvested tomatoes before entering art school -- his design portfolio included drawings of cats and fruit bowls. All along Mr. Ruby has customized his own clothing, at first with patches representing Black Flag and other punk bands he was following, and then, in recent years, with leftover fabrics systematically saved from his art productions.

""My mother sewed, my grandmother sewed, my aunts sewed,"" Mr. Ruby has said. It was his Dutch-born mother who had taught him the craft on a bulky metal Singer machine that he still owns. The autobiographical elements that vascularize nearly all of Mr. Ruby's artwork were so forcefully present on his runway that they obliged a viewer to consider how often fashion shows are about little more than the fact of their own occurrence. It was not necessary (although it helped) to know about the artist's reverence for craft, his appreciation for the accidental in art or his upbringing in a place where the neighbors quilted and drove to town in horse-drawn carriages. That all came through in the clothes. There were acid-washed blue coveralls, spaghetti-strap sheaths (worn by women; although the show was held during a men's wear week, Mr. Ruby offered designs that were largely gender neutral) worn atop trousers with vast bag legs reminiscent of Rick Owens. There was spatter-dyed work wear resembling the items Mr. Ruby installed in a vitrine for a 2016 show at the Sprueth Magers gallery in London. There were stiffened ponchos that could have been uniforms for members of some survivalist cult. There were dresses photo-printed with burning candles and weed-strewn lots, photographed by Mr. Ruby's wife, Melanie Schiff. There were images of fruit and tools collaged onto pants and left afloat on a ground of denim. There were ""Kimmy Schmidt""-style chastity dresses, a quilted middy and, on one model, a vinyl tabard printed with the cover work from ""Hex,"" a 1972 book about murder among the Pennsylvania Dutch.

It feels dated now to talk about the sniffy attitude the art world traditionally took about fashion. Plenty of other artists have expressed a love of clothes and the fashion world in their work. What sets Mr. Ruby apart is his refusal to draw distinctions between one form of creative practice and another.

Music,"Jason Isbell, Self-Doubt and the Album That Tested His Marriage",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/arts/music/jason-isbell-reunions.html,"Jason Isbell and his wife, the musician Amanda Shires, challenged each other during the making of his new album, ""Reunions.""Credit...Eric Ryan Anderson for The New York Times



Jason Isbell and his wife, the musician Amanda Shires, challenged each other during the making of his new album, ""Reunions.""

A couple of weeks into coronavirus-compelled self-quarantine at his home on a rolling patch of land 30 minutes south of Nashville, Jason Isbell did something he hadn't done in more than eight years. That morning, he'd been arguing with his wife, the singer-songwriter Amanda Shires, and dealing with their 4-year-old daughter's tantrum over not wanting to wash her hands again. Isbell was walking through his bathroom, the day's petty frustrations spinning around his head, when he decided to rinse his mouth out. Isbell is a recovering alcoholic but hadn't sworn off Listerine, despite its nearly 27 percent alcohol content. This time though, instead of swishing the mouthwash around and spitting it into the sink, he swallowed it like a shot of Jack Daniel's. ""It wasn't a conscious choice,"" he said a few days later, during a FaceTime call from his home. ""I just drank it without realizing what I was doing."" He quickly called Shires, who was in the barn that sits on their property about 100 yards from their house. ""I was concerned but not enough to be like, 'Call somebody,'"" Shires explained via a separate FaceTime call from the barn. ""I said, ""If today's going to be the day, let's find you a real nice bottle because I'm not going to let you just have Listerine.""

Sobriety is an integral part of the 41-year-old Isbell's career narrative. Back when he was drinking, he recorded three albums with the southern rock progressives the Drive-By Truckers, and three solo albums of alternately tender and raucous country-inflected rock. The first album he made after getting sober, ""Southeastern"" from 2013 -- a raw chronicle of his boozy rock-bottom and fragile redemption -- was his critical and commercial breakthrough. But the long shadow of his addictions has continued to haunt his music since. His new album, ""Reunions,"" due May 15, includes ""It Gets Easier,"" a howling barroom stomp about the ongoing challenges of staying sober. ""Maybe It's Time,"" a bleary-eyed ballad that Isbell wrote and the actor Bradley Cooper sang in the hit remake of ""A Star Is Born,"" lends depth to Cooper's portrayal of a drug-addled singer-songwriter. Even as his writing has increasingly focused less on his own trials and tribulations and more on those of the world around him, Isbell's years of hard-living have added a gravitas to his music that hasn't gone unnoticed. His 2015 album, ""Something More Than Free,"" and his 2017 release ""The Nashville Sound"" each debuted at the top of the Billboard rock and country charts, and collected four Grammys between them.

Isbell's sobriety has come hand-in-hand with a more settled domestic life. He and Shires married in 2013. The couple share a creative partnership that works alongside their romantic one: Shires plays fiddle and sings backup in Isbell's band, the 400 Unit, and Isbell plays guitar for Shires's roots-rock supergroup, the Highwomen. They each serve as a first listener and editor on the other's songs, and work deliberately to balance their separate career ambitions with their desires to spend time with their daughter. They've become the progressive ideal for successful, creative couples. From the outside looking in, Isbell looks very much like a man who has it all: sobriety, a beautiful family, the widespread respect of his peers, a thriving career doing exactly what he wants. And that's a problem. When Isbell first played ""Reunions"" songs for his wife, she could tell something was wrong. ""We sat down on this fake grass right here,"" Shires said, pointing her FaceTime screen toward the green artificial turf lining their barn's floor. ""He was already upset, angry and grumpy. I was like, 'Why am I sitting here in this cloud of weird while you're so unhappy about playing your songs?'"" Shires had seen her husband go through the album-making process multiple times, but he'd never been like this. As she began offering feedback, he bristled.

""I was resistant to input in a way I haven't been for the last few albums,"" Isbell admitted. Isbell, who grew up in the small town of Green Hill, Ala., is hyper-articulate and projects an air of infinite confidence, but is hardly an open book with his emotions. ""A lot of times he's curt and on-guard,"" said Shires. ""But I wasn't used to him doing that with me."" It took Isbell time to diagnose the problem, and even as we spoke in early April, he didn't sound particularly certain of it. ""For some reason, I felt really pressured,"" he said. In part, the pressure was to make an album that lived up to the reputations of his previous three, but it went beyond that too. Isbell's public image had become an albatross.

""You think, 'If I make a record that's not great, everybody's going to dismiss me entirely. If I [expletive] up my relationship, everybody's going to be so shocked that they'll write me off completely.' All those things, when you say them out loud sound ridiculous, but they stay in there and gnaw at you."" At the time, Isbell refused to acknowledge these anxieties. ""I got that male Southern attitude that still finds ways to sneak in where you have to pretend you're in control when you're not,"" he said. He pushed everyone away -- including his wife. ""He was impossible,"" Shires said. ""It was like he wanted help but didn't want help."" Tension between the two simmered. At one point, recording at the legendary RCA Studio A in Nashville with his longtime producer, Dave Cobb, Isbell complained that Shires's fiddle was too loud. ""I was like, 'Holy Christ! It's acoustic. I can't make it any quieter,'"" she said. The situation escalated, and Shires felt belittled. ""I want him to make the best art he can but not at the expense of making me feel less,"" she said. She decided to move into a hotel. ""I needed space because lines were getting crossed,"" she said.

These weren't splashy tabloid problems, they were the kinds of nebulous frustrations and quiet indignities that chip away at many marriages. ""I just had faith that eventually he'd come to the realization that as good of a father and a person as he is, even not drinking, you can still inflict harm onto people,"" said Shires. As Isbell acknowledged, ""It took a couple months until I wrapped my head all the way around it."" ""Reunions"" is not filled with songs about a marriage in crisis. In fact, one of the few new songs that clearly grew from the couple's relationship is the warm, spare, acoustic ""St. Peter's Autograph,"" which Isbell wrote about supporting Shires as she grieved the loss of her close friend, the singer-songwriter Neal Casal, who took his own life in August. ""I was trying to say, 'It's all right to grieve the parts of your relationship you might think I'd be upset or jealous about,'"" Isbell explained. The song's autobiographical roots have become more the exception than the rule for Isbell. Although he's certainly written his share of confessional tracks over the years, he feels he's graduated from needing to do that all the time. ""There is a constant progression for me to try to take my own experience out of the work,"" he said. ""It's what separates pros from beginners. Can you write about something other than yourself and not be vague, broad and cliched?"" Isbell certainly can. Going back to his Drive-By Truckers days, he could write about murderous family rivalries (""Decoration Day"") and New Deal government assistance programs (""T.V.A."") with an empathy and attention to detail that felt lived-in. But Isbell's creative struggles and marital drama do cast some new songs in a different light. ""Overseas,"" a wiry rocker about a couple separated by an ocean and the politics that make crossing that ocean impossible, feels like an allegory for any couple struggling to bridge the unbridgeable, with Isbell's cries of ""Our love won't change/Our love won't change/Our love won't change a thing,"" conveying both the undying faith and unbearable helplessness of navigating such a divide. The explosive ""Be Afraid,"" which is written in an accusatory second-person sneer, is, on one level, a straightforward indictment of political apathy among his musical peers and the country at large. But lines like ""See every one of us is counting dice we didn't roll/And the loser is the last one to ask for help,"" could easily be pointing back at himself.

Sonically, Isbell wanted ""Reunions"" to be ""more produced,"" than its predecessors, with a sound reminiscent of bands he heard on '80s rock radio growing up like Dire Straits, Crowded House and Squeeze. Cobb, who has produced Isbell's last four albums, said the goal was for ""it to sound bigger and slightly more polished. We used a lot of modern techniques that we've never touched before -- crazy panning and stereo depth stuff."" Ultimately though, the changes are less a wholesale makeover than just some significant tweaks. As Cobb put it, ""It's Jason."" After all the strife the album caused, it'd be understandable if Shires never wanted to hear it again, but that's not the case. ""It's the worst recording experience I've ever been a part of, but it's my favorite record he's made,"" she said. ""I'd like to say we're stronger because of it, but we're not. We just know that our strength is more than we thought."" Isbell doesn't think the album was affected by the turmoil he underwent making it but allowed for the possibility he could be wrong. ""Maybe you can hear it,"" he said. ""Maybe the record is better for it. I don't know. I try not to ask that question because I don't want to get in a pattern of [expletive] my life up to make better records."" For the first month of their self-quarantine, Shires livestreamed a mini-concert daily from their barn. Nearly every day, Isbell was there beside her, playing guitar, making bad jokes, and chipping in his own songs. Domestic bliss seemed restored. But what was the price of that bliss -- or at least a shot at it? Isbell may not want to screw up his life just to make better records but would he be willing to make worse ones if it meant a happier home? He'd take that deal for his daughter, he explained, but not his wife: ""She's an adult. She can handle it."" She fell in love with him not just knowing his artistic ambitions, but because of them. ""My wife wants me to do my best work,"" he continued. ""My job is to figure out how to do that and still be the best person I can be. Anything less is not what she wants.""",The 41-year-old musician is known as one of the best songwriters in the country.

Opinion,"Trump, Unrepentant and Unleashed",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment-trial-witnesses.html,"WASHINGTON -- During a meeting with Donald Trump at Trump Tower in June of 2016, with the opera bouffe builder improbably heading toward the nomination despite a skeletal campaign crew on a floor below, I asked when he would pivot. We all assumed he would have to pivot, that he would have to stop his belittling Twitter rants, that he would have to cease attacking fellow Republicans like John McCain, that he would have to get more in line with the traditional stances of his party, that he would have to be less of a barbarian at the gates of D.C. He crossed his arms, pursed his lips and shook his head -- a child refusing vegetables. How naive he was, I thought to myself. But I was the naive one. Trump has forced the world to pivot to him. The state of the union is upside down and inside out and sauerkraut. Trump has changed literally everything in the last three years, transforming and coarsening the game. On Friday night, he became, arguably, the most brutishly powerful Republican of all time. Never has a leader had such a stranglehold on his party, subsuming it with one gulp.

As the Senate voted 51 to 49 to smother the impeachment inquiry, guided by the dark hand of Mitch McConnell, it felt like the world's greatest deliberative body had been hollowed out, diminished. McConnell let Mitt Romney and Susan Collins vote to allow documents and witnesses such as John Bolton, knowing two could strain at the leash safely. The rest of the senators fell into line as sycophantic clones of Mike Pence. The impeachment trial amounted to one side being earnest and one pretending to be. It was exactly what Nancy Pelosi feared would happen before she was reluctantly drawn into the show trial. ""Now the State of the Union is going to be the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man coming down the street and standing in the rubble of what's left of the Congress,"" keened one Democrat on Friday night. ""The Republican Party has now lost whatever control they could exert over this president, any oversight they could have. It's gone. The state of the union is there is no union. How can there be, when one side is petrified of their Godzilla?"" Senator Chris Murphy, the Connecticut Democrat, dismissed Republicans as ""a cult of personality"" around Trump.

""This trial in so many ways crystallized the completely diametrically opposed threats that Democrats and Republicans see to the country,"" Murphy told The Times's Nicholas Fandos. ""We perceive Donald Trump and his corruption to be an existential threat to the country. They perceive the deep state and the liberal media to be an existential threat to the country. ""That dichotomy, that contrast, has been growing over the last three years, but this trial really crystallized that difference. We were just speaking different languages, fundamentally different languages when it came to what this trial was about. They thought it was about the deep state and the media conspiracy. We thought it was about the president's crimes."" I feel like I have spent my career watching the same depressing dynamic that unspooled Friday night: Democrats trying, sometimes ineptly, to play fair and Republicans ruthlessly trying to win. I watched it with the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas hearings. I watched it in the 2000 recount with Bush versus Gore. I watched it with the push by W., Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld to go to war in Iraq. I watched it with the pantomime of Merrick Garland. Democrats are warning Republicans that they will be judged harshly by history. But in the meantime, the triumphant Republicans get to make history. And a lot of the history that Republicans have made is frightening: the endless, futile wars, the obliviousness to climate change, the stamp on the judiciary. As Carl Hulse writes in his book, ""Confirmation Bias,"" about the Garland fiasco: ""The success in naming judges was the signal achievement of Trump's first two years. In the coming years, those judges will be among the members of the federal bench called to rule on Trump's policies and practices in cases arising from challenges initiated by increasingly confrontational Democrats and other legal adversaries around the nation. Mitch McConnell made a snap decision one night in 2016. The consequences will reverberate for decades."" For hours on Friday, the House managers made their vain final arguments. Pressing for Bolton's testimony, Val Demings implored Republican senators: Aren't you worried that, if left in office, Trump will harm America's national security, seek to corrupt the upcoming election and undermine our democracy to further his own personal gain? Don't you want to hear the witnesses and see the documents that would give the full story and make this a fair trial rather than a mock one?

""This is the American way and this is the American story,"" Demings told the Republican senators as they looked back at her, impassive or impatient. But, of course, they didn't want that. As he voted against witnesses and documents, Lamar Alexander, McConnell's pal, said Trump did something inappropriate but they just did not accept that it was impeachable, and they did not want to tear up ballots and ""pour gasoline on cultural fires that are burning out there."" So why not shut it down and cover it up? The books were cooked from the start. As with so many other pivotal moments in modern history, Republicans wanted to win, not look for the truth. And history, God help us, is written by the winners.","The diabolical duo of Donald and Mitch, serving their own interests, not the national one.",6798ddc5-9f9f-5959-9408-b034dbc68f42,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/02/opinion/02dowd1/02dowd1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=07f00da85f622fcd76e073232c540568620db38bd9d264b7da66c04608d9d29a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Senator Kyrsten Sinema and her fellow Democrats could get only a show trial out of the Republican majority.,6798ddc5-9f9f-5959-9408-b034dbc68f42,N24News/imgs/6798ddc5-9f9f-5959-9408-b034dbc68f42.jpg,11
Sports,"Katie Ledecky Is Swimming, and Studying",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/sports/coronavirus-ledecky-olympics-swimmers.html,"People throughout the sports world, from athletes to arena staff members, tell The New York Times how their lives have changed during the coronavirus pandemic. It was a Saturday in California and the five-time Olympic gold medalist Katie Ledecky had a competition later in the afternoon to look forward to. Not the swim meet in Mission Viejo that had originally filled her calendar for this past weekend, but a virtual game, Cards Against Humanity, with a group of roughly 20 relatives, mostly cousins, organized by her older brother, Michael. Last month in Des Moines at a tuneup meet for the Olympic trials, Ledecky produced her fastest 1,500-meter freestyle since May 2018, buoying her prospects of winning as many as five more Olympic gold medals, including the ""Ledecky Slam"" in the 200-400-800-1,500 freestyles, at the Tokyo Games. But within a week of returning to her Stanford training base from Iowa, she was scrambling to find pool space after the university facilities shut down because of the coronavirus crisis. The Olympics have been postponed a year and the college remains shut down, but Ledecky, who is from Bethesda, Md., and her training mate, the four-time Olympic medalist Simone Manuel, continue to swim daily in a family's two-lane, 25-yard backyard pool a short drive from the Stanford campus. Aside from her daily swim, Ledecky, 23, is sheltering in place at her two-bedroom apartment near Stanford but staying busy. After taking a year off school to focus on her Olympic preparation, Ledecky, a psychology major at Stanford, re-enrolled in online classes for the spring quarter, which began April 6 -- 13 days after the Olympics were postponed. The four courses she is taking include one on infectious diseases.

This interview has been lightly edited for clarity and condensed. Q: How did you come to take an infectious disease class? Ledecky: It's Global Change and Emerging Infectious Disease, and it actually fulfills my last general requirement. It's a lot about the different environmental and social factors that cause these outbreaks. They go through SARS and MERS and H.I.V., but there's definitely a focus on coronavirus. Our professors are giving us insight on the data that they're tracking. It's a lot about the bats and the markets and learning how to calculate transmission rates and contractibility and all those different things. It's been really fascinating. How much are you venturing outside? I've been able to swim at somebody's backyard pool and that's about a five-minute drive away, and that's basically the only time I go out. I feel lucky that I'm able to get my aerobic workout in from that so I don't have to do any running or cycling. I got some bands and a couple of weights and a pull-up bar. I have a tiny balcony, and there's one part of it that has a little bit of space, so that's where I do my dryland to get a little more fresh air. I haven't gone to a grocery store in about a month. I've just been using grocery delivery apps. I've been doing that and HelloFresh, which U.S.A. Swimming got us for a discount at one point so I signed up for it. You pick three recipes per week, and each has two servings, so I get two meals out of each. I've been getting all my meat out of that and then I get snacks and food for breakfast and lunch from the grocery stores. You swam so well in Des Moines the first full weekend of March. How do you process everything that has happened since?

I felt really good about my swims and felt it was indicative of how I was training. It was nice to see that starting to show in meets. I was excited to get back to work. It's tough when you're doing well and feeling good about things and then things change. But I feel good about where I was at and feel I'll be able to maintain that, and replicate that and remember how that felt. There's so much uncertainty about the next year: What meets will we have? What will our next meet be? Will we be able to train long course? Will we be able to train as a team and with other people again? All of that. It's hard to really think about the next thing so I'm just thinking day by day. I've been doing a lot of virtual video calls with other teams and groups and it's tough to see the younger athletes struggling with it, who have such a love for the sport and it's been so much a part of their routine and their social life and all of it. Do you worry about the ripple effects on the sport when it's already been announced that outdoor pools will be shuttered this summer in New York? I don't know what's going to happen to the summer leagues like the one that I got my start in. That's a huge gateway for the sport, the way a lot of young kids find their way into it. That's a year lost on that. I worry about small club teams. Even just thinking about how workouts are going to change when things get back to normal. Will teams have to limit the number of people in lanes? Maybe groups will only be able to swim once a day instead of doubles because they have to extend out the training times. I think it's going to change some of the mental aspects of training in the sport. What is the one non-swimming activity you are most looking forward to being able to do once the lockdown is lifted? I think seeing my family. I don't know if that will mean I travel to see them or they travel to see me. I don't know if I'll be able to give them a hug, but just being able to be with them will be nice. It's even harder to think of my extended family, especially my two grandmothers. Will I see them again? That's harder to think about. We're all staying in pretty good touch. We've been watching Mass together on Sundays with my grandma in North Dakota. We get together over Zoom and share a screen and live-stream Mass.",The five-time Olympic gold medalist is taking an infectious diseases class at Stanford and still finding a way to train.,474d9381-7b31-5b0e-ab69-3ee19f9c8619,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/27/sports/24sideline-ledecky-print/24sideline-ledecky-print-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=c3ba9bf56ddf9f31a8535dab87bef7490cf7b283cedad7265dc75122e6897335&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Katie Ledecky before a race in Des Moines on March 5.

Television,The Super Bowl Is Problematic. Why Can't We Look Away?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/arts/television/super-bowl-why-watch.html,"AUSTIN CONSIDINE Friends: I know what I'm doing Sunday. I know what you're doing Sunday. As full-time culture journalists, to ignore the Super Bowl would be a gross dereliction of duty. That's because the Super Bowl isn't just a game. It's the halftime show; it's the ads; it's the chips and guac. It is sport but also music, dance, costumes, TV production and stage design -- a pop culture event greater than the sum of its parts. Perhaps most important, it was watched last year by roughly 100 million people: In a world of on-demand entertainment, the Super Bowl is one of the last true vestiges of an era when we all watched the same things at the same time. But I, like a lot of sports fans, have struggled in recent years to reconcile what is beautiful about the game with what is ugly. First, there's the degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits -- not only to concussions -- which the N.F.L. actively worked to conceal. Then there are the league's troubles with domestic abuse and race. We could unpack those for days, but let it suffice to note that Tyreek Hill still has a job and Colin Kaepernick does not. Some fans have learned to tolerate the cognitive dissonance, or to square their free enjoyment with the ostensible free will of the players. Others, like me, have trouble shouldering our complicity with football's worst elements and have mostly stopped watching. But regardless, fans or not, we mostly show up for the Super Bowl. Why is that?

WESLEY MORRIS Austin, I, too, have consumed less football in the last five years because the hits can be hard to watch, because the punitive, allegedly apolitical stances of the league are themselves paradoxically political. There are many amazing physical achievements in this sport. There's endless ridiculousness. The choreographed end-zone celebration, for instance, has gleefully migrated to other sports. And the league, in spite of itself, has a muscular charitable wing. This is to say that loving the N.F.L. means putting up with a lot. But its outsize popularity also seems a partial answer to the moral riddle that's so openly vexed us these past two or three years. How do we enjoy the work of bad, unpleasant, corrupt people and institutions? Of criminals? Does opting into the Super Bowl experience then condone the problems of football? Can spectatorship be anything but an endorsement? It's the conundrum of a capitalist society to the extent that it's truly a conundrum at all.

CARYN GANZ Football is the quintessential problematic fave. And like Michael Jackson, it's too challenging to cancel, too big to fail, too embedded in the fabric of American leisure to rip out. (For now, at least.) The Super Bowl is drama, emotion, identity, catharsis, spectacle, skill, power: It's nearly impossible to find a viewer beyond its scope. It's no longer possible to keep up with everything happening in television, movies, music and digital media, but the Super Bowl is one of the last gasps of the monoculture. It's a given and a gimme: It has almost no barrier for entry -- one network channel, one block of time when nobody is expected to be doing anything other than watching the Super Bowl. And as for the ethical conundrum, ethics are under siege in every corner of our society: on social media, in Washington, in college admissions, on the music charts. In an era of ""LOL nothing matters,"" where does football rank on the scale of horrors? Even if your answer is ""quite high,"" there are 100 million other viewers willing to share the shame.

MORRIS Caryn, don't play. You know I know Madonna's set list from that night. I also remember how the emotional properties of the Boston bar where I watched that game completely changed as her halftime show began. The Patriots were about to lose another Super Bowl to the Giants, and even though they were up (by a point) going into the second half, that woman and her friends seemed to lighten the mood. Men were mouthing along to ""Open Your Heart."" But they were also happy to partake in the spectacle of a 53-year-old imposing her sexual-identity gender circus (a phalanx of beefcake transported her to the stage) upon a sport whose stated orientation points, non-negotiably, one way. This is to say that the halftime show can be received multiple ways at once. It's an event complicit in all that dismays us about American football as a whole and the N.F.L. especially: players' physical and mental health; compensation and exploitation; the sanctioned conflation with the league and our military; the names. Kansas City's excellent Super Bowl team is the Chiefs; and when fans are feeling confidently vicious, half the arms in the stadium begin to tomahawk chop. (They're not the so-called Redskins, and yet the team brings with it many centuries of terrible history anytime it plays -- anytime its ""merch"" is sold.)

But the halftime show is also an event wholly outside the problems of the sport. Its stars have been imported and occasionally seem eager to practice subversion, as Madonna and Beyonce have; to practice an exuberant nothing, as Katy Perry has. It is what its stars fight for it to be. I'm enormously excited to see what J. Lo and Shakira have fought for. We are, though, at a really fascinating place now. An aspect of the culture is asking these entertainers to consider what it means to partake in an event that could feature any number of problematic figures. (Tyreek Hill is a star Chief.) And on Madonna's night, in 2012, Aaron Hernandez scored one of the Patriots' touchdowns. In 2013, he was charged with (and later found guilty of) shooting and killing a man. GANZ Halftime may hover in a space outside the problems of the sport, but it has its own crises related to football's troubled racial and gender dynamics. Consider how the Super Bowl completely reshaped Janet Jackson's career. Jackson had five No. 1 albums and was known as one of the biggest pop stars on the planet, but less than three seconds in 2004 -- so-called ""Nipplegate,"" when her bare breast was exposed by Justin Timberlake during the last moments of their performance -- rewrote her entire history, plunging her into years of purgatory. It only briefly affected Timberlake's, since he has the luxury of being white and male. (Remember, he returned to headline halftime in 2018.) CONSIDINE Does making Jennifer Lopez and Shakira the halftime show headliners -- a first for Latinas -- feel like a transparent scramble by the N.F.L. to virtue-signal? To be more charitable, it makes sense that the league might simply want to pay tribute to the Hispanic heritage of this year's host city, Miami. But wasn't the N.F.L. probably compelled to do something extra after the outspoken way in which multiple artists last year turned down the opportunity in support of Colin Kaepernick? And after Rihanna did the same this season?

GANZ Sports and music are two arenas in which the stars are mostly young and black but work in a structure still largely controlled by older white men. The idea that some of the most powerful players in the music industry shunned halftime last year is a compelling one. (Maroon 5 agreed to perform and paid some sort of karmic tax.) This year is the first under the partnership between Jay-Z's Roc Nation and the league, an attempt to smooth over tensions and bring a crumb of social-justice work to the game. And it's interesting that this year's headliners are both Latin pop stars, and neither black nor rappers. The halftime show hasn't had a black headliner since Beyonce in 2013; the closest it's come to a hip-hop headliner is the Black Eyed Peas. If football fans are perceived to be so conservative they'd switch the channel rather than watch rappers, why hasn't country music ever been very welcome at halftime? Its last appearance came 17 years ago with Shania Twain.

CONSIDINE The dearth of country music at halftime is interesting when you consider that the singer most associated with the N.F.L. in recent years has been Carrie Underwood -- and before that, Hank Williams Jr. For that reason, I suspect that country music wouldn't actually be unwelcome by most football fans at halftime. I'm also interested in a reverse question: Why has non-country music always been welcome? My guess is that with the exception of one Trump-fueled moment in which some conservative fans skipped a game or two, the league knows it has that demographic locked down, no matter who performs at halftime. The billing, then, is a chance for the N.F.L. to snag some extra eyeballs, and pop is a surefire way to do it. In racial or political terms, I'll wager many of those fans who objected to Kaepernick's knee-taking fancy themselves quite open-minded -- or at least magnanimously indifferent -- regarding the race or style of the performers, same as with the players. If I'm right, then the N.F.L. risks little in ignoring those fans' musical preferences for 15 minutes. Intolerant people make low-stakes claims to tolerance all the time. But that tolerance reveals its limits when, say, a black man takes a knee. MORRIS Colin Kaepernick and Michael Bennett and their fellow protesting players knelt for ideals that I, too, believe in. Pleas for justice and equality are controversial coming only from black athletes expected -- hired -- to run, throw, catch and dunk. But the culture has moved past the protests. Kaepernick still has a sports job of sorts. He works for Nike. Meanwhile, the Super Bowl remains this idyllic vestige of who we thought we were. It's Americana that like lots of Americana is built on a cemetery of sorts. We flock to it as we do because it's a spectatorship department store -- sports, ads, music. A lot of us remember the alleged simpler times when it was easier to pretend that entertainment was all it was. On one Sunday, we can pause Everything Else and just enjoy a miraculous helmet catch or a commercial for a job-finding company. It's also a stable structure. We all know it. We know it will never change and therefore never challenge most people to confront more than their losing team. There's no M.C. to be urbane or smug or real. Setting aside the violence at its center, it's safe, a haven from so much. History in the making but also passionately ahistorical. Americana on the one hand, sure. But also just America.","The halftime show, the ads, the parties: The Super Bowl is more than a game, and 100 million of us tune in despite the sport's uglier controversies.

Music,'Stranger Things' Season 3 Is a Portal to 1985. Here's What It Sounded Like.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/arts/music/stranger-things-1985-playlist.html,"Season 3 of Netflix's beloved nostalgia creep-out ""Stranger Things"" premiered over the long weekend, bringing Hawkins, Ind., into the summer of 1985. In towns that didn't have a portal to the Upside Down, those months may have been memorable for films like ""Back to the Future,"" cultural events like Live Aid and landmark sports victories , like the Lakers defeating the Celtics in the N.B.A. Finals. Here's a playlist of 19 hits -- and one iconic musical broadcast -- that were floating in the musical ether back then.

Katrina and the Waves were underground vets: The guitarist Kimberley Rew was in Robyn Hitchcock's wildly influential psychedelic punk band the Soft Boys, and the other three members had gigged around England as a cover band called Mama's Cookin'. Their early singles didn't land, but the Waves got some attention when the Bangles covered their 1982 album track ""Going Down to Liverpool."" A slick production and a horn arrangement on another old tune turned ""Walking on Sunshine"" into a giddy smash. Katrina Leskanich told The Guardian in 2015, ""I'd been this sulky goth and suddenly I was 'Chrissie Hynde with a smile' fronting 'the new Monkees.'""

The 'Til Tuesday leader Aimee Mann would ultimately maintain a long career as a songwriter of beloved, literate indie rock, writing an Oscar-nominated song for the 1999 film ""Magnolia"" and releasing seven albums on her own SuperEgo Records. But in 1985 she was a Boston ex-punk who scored this Top 10 single, which she said was ""like the first or second or third song I ever wrote by myself, except [for] a couple terrible garbagey things when I was 16."" The song would stick around; however, the long blond rattail she sported on the album art and in the music video would not. ""I think it may be in a cigar box somewhere,"" she told Rolling Stone in 1996. Lisa Lisa and Cult Jam Featuring Full Force, 'I Wonder if I Take You Home'

The biggest hit from these protegees of the superfreaky funkateer Rick James was a Top 10 pop smash. Lines like ""I'll be your sugar in the morning/And the sweet stuff you need at night"" raised the eyebrows of the Parents Music Resource Center, which Tipper Gore helped found, and this buoyant dance tune ended up on its Filthy 15. ""At the time, I also felt that this was just a feeble attempt at 'censorship' to the music that was created by Rick James,"" the group's leader, Jojo McDuffie, told Rolling Stone. R.E.M., 'Can't Get There From Here'

A warm message of acceptance housed in a chilly industrial production. Already established in their native Britain, the synth-pop pioneers Depeche Mode had their first American pop hit with this ice-cold collection of keyboards, drum machines, tape loops and clanging metal. Dave Gahan told Entertainment Weekly about this era: ""We used to go into studios, and the first thing we'd do, we'd ask where the kitchen was -- literally for pots and pans and things that we could throw down the stairs, and record the rhythms they would make crashing around, and then make it into loops.""

After watching a PBS documentary about Vietnam veterans dealing with post-traumatic stress disorder, the British producer Paul Hardcastle sampled some of the bleak dialogue and stuttered it out into an unlikely electro hit. Inspired by the music of Afrika Bambaataa, and with a hook tapped out on an early sampling synth, it was a stark hit that was less about the politics of dancing and more for dancing about politics.

The Harlem hip-hop trio Boogie Boys had produced one of the better 12-inches from hip-hop's disco era with ""Rappin' Aint No Thing"" (1981). But the group really took off in the age of drum machines. The producer Ted Currier recycled the drums from another song that he had made, Sly Fox's ""Let's Go All the Way."" ""Totally different song but same track -- with some overdubs and omissions,"" Currier told Red Bull Music Academy. ""The pulse of the record demanded attention. And how often does that happen?""","Listen to a playlist of songs from the summer that brought Prince's ""Raspberry Beret"" and Aretha Franklin's ""Freeway of Love.""",6990c880-7854-528f-84c3-42fe18fbe9cb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/12/arts/09strangerplaylist-combo/09strangerplaylist-combo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5b9272994feb8a752d2ecb7dcea6e234ec70ee638b7044b9b9d962be64c37464&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left: Prince, Simon Le Bon of Duran Duran and Aimee Mann of 'Til Tuesday all produced memorable hits in 1985.",6990c880-7854-528f-84c3-42fe18fbe9cb,N24News/imgs/6990c880-7854-528f-84c3-42fe18fbe9cb.jpg,12
Media,BuzzFeed Plans Layoffs as It Aims to Turn Profit,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/business/media/buzzfeed-layoffs.html,"BuzzFeed, often hailed as the future of publishing and a leading producer of digital content, plans to lay off 15 percent of its work force, or around 200 employees, according to a memo sent to the staff on Wednesday night. The company's management team, led by the chief executive, Jonah Peretti, has been working on the staff cuts over the past few months, two people with knowledge of the plans said. They asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the matter. The cuts will affect the international and web content departments, including the news division. Mr. Peretti sent a note to employees at 6:30 p.m. Eastern time with the subject line ""Difficult Changes."" ""Hello BuzzFeeders,"" he wrote. ""I'm writing with sad news: we are doing layoffs at BuzzFeed next week. We will be making a 15% overall reduction in headcount across the company. I'm sending this tonight because I wanted you to hear it from me directly instead of from the press.""

The move is meant to trim costs and maintain growth as the company aims to hit profitability this year. BuzzFeed, which employs over 1,300 people, generated more than $300 million in revenue in 2018. That was a jump of better than 15 percent from the previous year, but the company still loses money. [UPDATE: BuzzFeed's first round of layoffs puts an end to its national news desk.] Known for its mastery of the viral arts, the site relies on an army of editors, producers and journalists to produce thousands of pieces of content each week, as varied as cooking videos and breaking news reports. BuzzFeed News, a money-losing division of the company led by the editor Ben Smith, came under scrutiny in recent days after publishing an article reporting that President Trump had instructed his former lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, to lie in his testimony to Congress. In a rare public statement, the special counsel's office denied the report. Mr. Smith has said he stands by the article. Digital publishers have suffered as shifting reader habits and whimsical-seeming algorithm adjustments at Facebook have cut into revenue. Vice Media reduced staff last year in a bid to reach profits. Mic, a site aimed at younger readers, cut the majority of its staff before being sold off in a fire sale to a competitor. And on Wednesday CNN Business reported that Verizon Media Group, which includes Yahoo, AOL and HuffPost, plans to reduce its staff by 7 percent -- a cut of some 800 employees. Advertisers generally pay less to reach online readers than print devotees, but investors were banking on the idea that online ad rates would significantly rise and digital publishers would dominate. That hasn't happened as Facebook and Google continue to siphon off the majority of ad dollars.

BuzzFeed's board recently agreed that the company needs to start turning profits, the people said. The site has lost money for most of the years it has been in operation, not unusual for a start-up. Venture-backed companies like BuzzFeed often spend big at first in a bid to expand. But as the company closes in on a decade in business, investors are losing patience. In his note, Mr. Peretti said, ""The restructuring we are undertaking will reduce our costs and improve our operating model so we can thrive and control our own destiny, without ever needing to raise funding again. These changes will allow us to be the clear winner in the market as the economics of digital media continue to improve.""

BuzzFeed has raised nearly $500 million in venture funding, with $400 million coming from NBCUniversal. Mr. Peretti, a graduate of the M.I.T. Media Lab and a founder of HuffPost, started BuzzFeed in 2006 as a something of an experiment to see whether his team could create content that readers were eager to share on social media. It became a genuine business by 2011 and amassed a large following by hitting on a formula that took advantage of the new publishing platforms on Facebook, YouTube and Twitter. BuzzFeed's monthly readership is nothing to LOL at: 690 million, a figure that has made it the envy of the web.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. That still may not be enough. BuzzFeed took a hit when Facebook introduced a sweeping change in 2016 that significantly reduced the visibility of articles and videos from professional publishers in its News Feed, its main artery of content. The change hurt all content companies -- including Vox Media, Refinery29 and Group Nine, the publisher of popular sites like The Dodo -- and forced them to adjust their strategies to rely less on platforms like Facebook. In a November interview with The New York Times, Mr. Peretti proffered an audacious solution: a series of mergers with five or six top internet publishers, including Vice, Vox Media, Group Nine and Refinery.

The industrial logic was evident, he said. A larger entity could lobby for a higher percentage of the ad dollars that Facebook and Google share with publishers when their content, videos in particular, run on the platforms. In turn, publishers would be able to supply them with content that is safe for general users and friendlier for advertisers. ""Having some bigger companies that actually care about the quality of the content feels like something that's very valuable,"" he said at the time. In an effort to add more revenue streams, BuzzFeed has started new business lines, offering a cookware line at Walmart and a toy store in Manhattan. It also started placing banner ads across its website. That represented a change of course for Mr. Peretti, who once said he didn't want banner ads, because they significantly slowed down the site. In their place he pushed for native ads -- posts that look like editorial content but are created in cooperation with marketers. Native advertising slowed considerably in 2017, however. Coupled with changes at Facebook, the rate of revenue growth declined. The addition of banner ads significantly added to BuzzFeed's coffers last year, the people said. In his note to the staff, Mr. Peretti said he took the layoffs to heart. ""On a personal note,"" he wrote, ""I've never thought about my job as 'just business.' I care about the people at BuzzFeed more than anything other than my family. This will be a tough week for all of us and I realize it will be much worse for the people losing their jobs. To them, I want to say thank you, I'm sorry our work together is ending this way, and I hope we get to work together again in the future. Our loss will be to the benefit of other organizations where I know you will go on to make formidable contributions."" BuzzFeed has had staff reductions in the past. In 2017, it cut 100 of its 1,600-employee work force after it failed to meet revenue targets that year. As BuzzFeed looks to cut down its staff once again during a difficult period for web media companies, traditional publishers have also struggled. Gannett, the owner of USA Today and The Detroit Free Press, has cut its work force sharply over the past few years. A company overview from the end of 2015 showed 19,600 employees. By the end of 2017, the figure was down to 15,300. On Wednesday, there were more layoffs at Gannett newspapers across the country, including The Indianapolis Star and The Record in New Jersey. The company is slimming down in an effort to shore up its shrinking profits. Separately, a company controlled by the New York hedge fund Alden Global Capital -- which itself has made drastic cuts at newspapers in its stable, including The Denver Post -- has expressed interest.","About 15 percent of its work force will be cut, or about 200 employees across the company's departments, including the news division.",4fed5d6c-f25c-581d-92f5-9a547a788c47,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/24/business/24BUZZFEED-01/merlin_148026444_5220b66c-fad3-4db5-8b99-6a22638b470a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=defbf1eb1941160972e0e30964f06ef8f863086640dafde5aa0e8ca46a492788&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,BuzzFeed News employees last month at the company's headquarters in New York.,4fed5d6c-f25c-581d-92f5-9a547a788c47,N24News/imgs/4fed5d6c-f25c-581d-92f5-9a547a788c47.jpg,16
Movies,'Marriage Story': Autobiographical or Personal? Noah Baumbach Explains,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/27/movies/marriage-story-noah-baumbach.html,"Noah Baumbach knows how it looks. The director, 50, has a new movie out, ""Marriage Story,"" that seems, on the surface, very ""Noah Baumbach."" There are the usual Baumbauch-ian characters -- artistic, bourgeois, alternately sympathetic and repellent -- caught in scenarios that feel naturalistic to the point of suspicion, as if torn from the pages of an unsparing notebook. In ""Kicking and Screaming"" (1995), made shortly after he'd graduated from Vassar, his subject was twentysomethings fresh out of an elite college, struggling to accept a world beyond their unbounded egos. In ""The Squid and the Whale"" (2005), it was an erudite Brooklyn family in the 1980s, mired in the circular firing squad of a bitter divorce. The patriarch, played by Jeff Daniels, wore a sport coat that belonged to Baumbach's actual father. With ""Marriage Story,"" a probable Oscar contender for best picture and original screenplay, available on Netflix Dec. 6, Baumbach has returned to divorce once more. The film captures a marriage as seen in the rearview, as both partners, a New York theater director and an actress with a past and potential future in Hollywood, veer in opposite directions and toward opposite coasts. Its verisimilitude has inspired comparisons to the director's own marriage, to the Los Angeles-born actress Jennifer Jason Leigh, whom he divorced in 2013.

Would you believe it if he told you that even though the movie's central characters, Charlie (played by Adam Driver) and Nicole (Scarlett Johansson), share biographical details with Baumbach and Leigh, their actual stories don't have all that much in common? ""I couldn't write an autobiographical movie if I tried,"" Baumbach said when we sat down for a conversation (edited excerpts below) at his favorite Italian bistro in Manhattan's West Village. He was wearing a dark, wool suit, and a strand of his silver-streaked black hair fell over one eye, framing the dramatic angles of his jaw. ""This movie is not autobiographical; it's personal, and there's a true distinction in that."" Can you elaborate on what you see as the difference between autobiographical and personal? I think when people say autobiographical, they're assuming it's one-to-one, which none of my movies are in the slightest. I might use autobiographical details at times, but any extrapolation beyond that has no meaning to the work or to me or anything else. Why do you think you're more vulnerable to that sort of extrapolation than other filmmakers? I guess partly because my movies take place in some version of the real world, so there's a kind of identification. If you're watching a David Lynch movie, you're not like, ""Oh, that just happened to me,"" when, if you watch ""Marriage Story,"" you might think, ""Oh, I've had that experience.""

What kinds of things make you stop and say, ""This should be in a movie?"" This is a small one, but I grew up in Brooklyn. At some point, walking out of a subway up to the street, to me, felt like something I wanted to put in a movie. I love the idea of rising out of the earth -- something about the way the emotion and the imagery come together for me. Other times, there might be something that feels like fodder for a scene. With [""The Meyerowitz Stories (New and Selected)"" from 2017], I had been spending a lot of time in hospitals [his father, the novelist Jonathan Baumbach, died in March] and was thinking of a doctor going on vacation when you need them most, or the nurses switching over and you don't like the new nurse. That kind of thing can be incredibly frustrating, but it feels alive in some way, like a wire of electricity you can use to activate something else. Is it ever disruptive to your life when you're thinking in those terms? It can be. But to me it's almost an affectionate response to something. And it doesn't really take me out of the experience, it's just a kind of a companion thought to what I'm going through. How did you go about getting into Charlie and Nicole's heads? It was a lot of research. Talking to friends, and then to friends of friends, and then to the lawyers and mediators of friends. I would talk to both the women and the men to get all of the different perspectives, which helped externalize things. The actors were incredibly helpful, as well, Adam and Scarlett. I brought in Scarlett and Laura [Dern, who plays Nicole's high-powered lawyer] early on, and they would talk about their experiences in relationships, and divorce, and career, and just being human beings. I also live with Greta [Gerwig, the actress and director, who co-wrote ""Frances Ha"" (2013) and ""Mistress America"" (2015) with Baumbach] and she and I are very involved in each other's projects, so I often would show her things to read, or talk it out with her and get ideas.

When you're writing characters who are inspired by people in your life, do you think about the moment when they'll see it? What do you see as your responsibility in that situation? Well, the characters are always a kind of stew, not a one-to-one stand-in for a real person. But if I use a specific detail from someone, I'll definitely ask their permission. But really the only times people have come up to me and said, ""Hey, you based this thing on me,"" were times when I didn't. Did you get feedback from your ex-wife? Well I showed her the script and I showed her the movie, just so she would know what it is. No, but I could've still made changes. But I didn't have any concerns about it, and she really liked it, because it isn't about our marriage. That's not to say that there aren't emotional connections, things that happened to me emotionally that are going to be translated in some way into this story, but I think that's true for every writer who's gone through breakups or been in love. How does it feel when people assume that it's about the two of you? Well people have been doing that, in some way, with every movie I've done. Sometimes I think it's a compliment that people are engaged or interested, that it must feel true because it provokes this feeling of wanting to know where something came from. It doesn't bother me, but it's also not something I can even answer to. It's a work of fiction, but it is extremely personal at the same time.

Looking back at your work, there's that stretch -- ""The Squid and the Whale,"" ""Margot at the Wedding"" and ""Greenberg"" -- where you were writing particularly biting, unkind or narcissistic characters. Critics at the time often wrote about the movies themselves in similar terms. I wonder if you see a link between those movies, or if, in hindsight, you think they're reflective of a particular phase in your life. No, I don't. I think it happens when you make a few movies, people start linking things up. I probably do it too with other people's movies. But I don't think of them that way. For me, it's just sort of a clash of ideas, or an actor, or things I was interested in then. ""Squid"" makes me very emotional, because it reminds me of the time I was writing it and feeling like it was my last chance after having struggled for a bit. [When the film was released, in 2005, Baumbach hadn't made a feature in eight years.] And I have a lot of affection for Margot and Greenberg. What made those characters so empathetic to me was that they were their own worst enemies. I don't know, do you see a connection between them? I see a few connections. But I think, certainly from ""Frances Ha"" onward, there started to be more lightness, or heart, or optimism in the work. I'm curious whether you attribute that shift -- if you acknowledge a shift -- to any particular change in your life or your thinking. Well, I'm sure there must be something to why I make the movie I make at the time that I make it. There must be something to that. But I don't analyze it. I don't think about it, really. ""Greenberg"" came up the other day with Greta, and we were talking about what we saw in it, how lonely those two characters were. I don't think I would make that movie now, but I'm glad I made it then. How do you think working with Greta has affected your outlook? I mean, she's a singular influence on me, as a creative person and as a person. Even when she was an actor in ""Greenberg,"" I recognized a familiarity to the way she played the part. Adam is that way, too -- they're in the language in a way that feels like they wrote it, even though they didn't. When Greta and I started actually writing together, it felt like a similar kind of natural extension. I think I've always recognized something in her -- the way that I would like to be, both as a person and, now, as a filmmaker.

I think I grew up in a way where there was this idea that you shouldn't celebrate. ""Don't celebrate because it all might just fall apart anyway."" Or ""Don't celebrate because something better will come and that'll be the thing you'll celebrate."" Of course, that just leads to death [laughs]. Greta knows how to celebrate. She is so enthusiastic and engages so much with the present that it helps me kind of appreciate what's going on in a way. I haven't always been good at enjoying everything, but I think I enjoy more now because of her.",The writer-director talks about showing his new Netflix movie to his ex-wife and the reason he's enjoying life more than ever.,5c40d0c3-24cb-5d1d-b5b4-87f85bae2279,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/01/arts/01noah-baumbach-4/01noah-baumbach-4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e01588ed50ac3c34b35f181df307a7d3fcbf4285b5857d7a3af0c5a36f772f44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Director Noah Baumbach, sits for a portrait at the Crosby hotel in Manhattan on November 11, 2019.",5c40d0c3-24cb-5d1d-b5b4-87f85bae2279,N24News/imgs/5c40d0c3-24cb-5d1d-b5b4-87f85bae2279.jpg,5
Theater,"Michael Friedman, a Man of Many Voices and a Gift for Prophecy",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/theater/michael-friedman-appraisal.html,"Sung with a snarl, and accompanied by twanging power chords, those words opened the floodgates to a wave of electric emotion -- a compound of rage, restlessness and a disgust with a ruling elite whose days had to be numbered. ""We're gonna take this country back,"" went the lyrics of this anthem for dispossessed Americans, ""for people like us, people who don't just think about things."" I first heard that song more than eight years ago at the Public Theater in downtown Manhattan. It was the opening number in a concert production of a show called ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,"" a musical portrait of the seventh president of the United States. It's been playing in my mind a lot recently. How prophetic it sounds now. How easily those lyrics, and the propulsive drive of discontent within that melody, might fit the supporters at a rally for Donald J. Trump, whose ascendancy to the American presidency few people anticipated. But in 2009, who knew?

The prescient creator of that tune -- and those words -- is Michael Friedman, who died on Saturday, of complications from AIDS, at 41. So I am now also remembering the thrill of listening to ""Populism Yea Yea"" (that's its title, naturally) that first time, with the shivers that come when an original new voice in theater declares itself. That song didn't sound like anything else from any American musical, ever. Whatever came next from this guy, I wanted to hear it.

The news of Mr. Friedman's death set off the kind of shock, sorrow and outrage occasioned by the similarly premature death of the 35-year-old Jonathan Larson in 1996, only weeks before the opening of ""Rent,"" the rock opera that would make his name. ""Awful"" was the word used by two different correspondents who emailed to tell me about Mr. Friedman, as if no tamer or more literary description would do. Once again, there was selfishness in the sorrow, a feeling of being deprived of a talent that still had so much to give, both to us and to a popular art form that always needs shaking up. And I don't think Mr. Friedman was accorded his due as an innovator. He wrote so fluently in so many styles, that it was tempting to dismiss him as a pastiche artist.

""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,"" which was scripted and directed by Alex Timbers (and which had a brief run on Broadway in 2010), used the adolescent angst of emo music to convey the growing pains of a restless young nation. For the musical adaptation of Shakespeare's ""Love's Labour's Lost,"" another collaboration with Mr. Timbers, staged as part of Shakespeare in the Park in 2012, Mr. Friedman riffed on Broadway-style brass and bubble gum sugar to conjure the goofy self-consciousness of young swains discovering romance.

Then there was ""The Fortress of Solitude,"" a stage version of Jonathan Lethem's novel (seen at the Public in 2014), in which Mr. Friedman aurally charted the evolution of a friendship through the years via echoes of what was borne on the radio waves, in orchestrated currents of soul, rap, pop and funk. And that's not even counting the music that Mr. Friedman composed for the Civilians, the exploratory theater troupe with which he was long associated, and for Shakespeare in the Park. His versatility is such that it's hard to conceive of the same artist coming up with the whispery, elegiac setting for Ariel's ""full fathom five"" incantation in ""The Tempest"" and the futurist distortions of Eminem and Britney Spears (and Gilbert & Sullivan!) performed in Anne Washburn's dystopian masterwork, ""Mr. Burns, a Post-Electric Play."" Such disparate creations do, however, share an advanced musical frame of reference and a crucial sense of what works in a given theatrical moment.

If that makes Mr. Friedman sound like a journeyman composer, then I've misled you. But he was willing to let his music blend into the background in a way seldom associated with musical theater artists, who like to stamp their signatures big on a production. Perhaps this seeming lack of ego came from his extensive work with the Civilians, a genuinely collective company, whose journalistic approach to a variety of subjects was a perfect fit for Mr. Friedman's mutability. But don't make the mistake of thinking that Mr. Friedman ever wrote by rote. More often than not, his compositions are steeped in authentic, subliminal feeling that is the opposite of mechanical. Listen again to the quieter ballads from ""Fortress of Solitude"" or the song ""Beautiful"" from ""Pretty Filthy,"" the Civilians musical about the pornography industry. These are numbers that throb, delicately but persistently, with the longing and regret inspired by life's illusions and evasions. As for ""Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson,"" yes, Mr. Friedman was working from the template of a mopey pop genre. But he wasn't making fun of the hungry, aspirational characters in this presentation of an American leader as a crowd-rousing, egomaniacal rock star. Mr. Friedman infused that work with an emotional ardor that goes way beyond irony. ""Bloody Bloody"" hardly became the Broadway blockbuster that is Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""Hamilton,"" another musical history lesson rendered in contemporary styles. And I wouldn't make a case for ""Bloody Bloody"" being a better show than ""Hamilton""; it's sketchier, for sure, and less celebratory. But in 2009, Mr. Friedman heard America singing in ways that match exactly this nation's temperament today. That requires an uncommonly sensitive ear, and a gift we could use more than ever.",His versatility as a musical theater composer was matched by his emotional ardor and political shrewdness.,4d5e22cd-4eb2-5c0a-883a-489ad7a3f7ee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/arts/12FRIEDMAN-APPRAISAL1/12FRIEDMAN-APPRAISAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8f85de7f38018db672ce6e7d6e1ce7786e26c668e735576e39fc1ecc9c6b5ac3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michael Friedman playing piano in the Civilians' ""Let Me Ascertain You"" concert at Joe's Pub in 2011.

Economy,Economy's Big Rebound Leaves a Shortfall as Progress Slows,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/business/economy/gdp-q3-economy.html,"U.S. economic output increased at the fastest pace on record last quarter as businesses began to reopen and customers returned to stores. But the economy has climbed only partway out of its pandemic-induced hole, and progress is slowing. Gross domestic product grew 7.4 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department said Thursday. The gain, the equivalent of 33.1 percent on an annualized basis, was by far the biggest since reliable statistics began after World War II. The rebound was fueled in part by trillions of dollars in federal assistance to households and businesses. That aid has since dried up, even as the recovery remains far from complete: The economy in the third quarter was 3.5 percent smaller than at the end of 2019, before the pandemic. By comparison, G.D.P. shrank 4 percent over the entire year and a half of the Great Recession a decade ago.

Economists said the third-quarter figures revealed less about the strength of the recovery than about the severity of the collapse that preceded it. G.D.P. fell 1.3 percent in the first quarter and 9 percent in the second as the pandemic forced widespread business closures. A big rebound was inevitable once the economy began to reopen. The challenge is what comes next. ""The reason we had such a big bounce is that the economy went from closed to partially open,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. ""The easy growth was exhausted, and now the hard work has to be done in terms of fully healing."" There are signs that the recovery is losing steam. Industrial production fell in September, and job growth has cooled, even as a growing list of major corporations have announced new rounds of large-scale layoffs and furloughs. Most economists expect the slowdown to worsen in the final three months of the year as virus cases rise and federal assistance fades. Forecasts for the next G.D.P. report are highly uncertain this early in the quarter. But most forecasters expect growth to slow to about 1 to 1.5 percent, with some economists anticipating even weaker results. That would leave the economy about 2.5 percent smaller than before the pandemic.

A 2.5 percent contraction would be the equivalent of a relatively typical recession -- smaller than the Great Recession but substantially worse than the mild downturns of the early 1990s and 2000s. ""We're no longer in unprecedented territory, but this is still a deep gash in our economy,"" said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist who studies recessions. What is troubling, Ms. Sinclair said, is that after the initial bounce, the economy appears to be falling into a pattern that has become familiar in recent decades: a steep drop in a recession, followed by a painfully slow rebound. Congress's failure to provide more stimulus money, she said, makes a weak recovery more likely. ""Without any further support, it's going to be a slog,"" she said. Separate data released by the Labor Department on Thursday showed that 732,000 workers filed new claims for state unemployment benefits last week, a decrease of about 28,000 from the week before. New claims have fallen only gradually in recent weeks and remain extraordinarily high by historical standards. And millions of people who lost jobs earlier in the pandemic remain unemployed. ""We're moving in the right direction, but not nearly as quickly as we need,"" said AnnElizabeth Konkel, a labor market economist for the Indeed Hiring Lab. ""We need to recover quicker so that we don't have people transitioning to long-term unemployment.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Laura Mayer was furloughed in March from her job as the general manager at Public House, a restaurant at Oracle Park, the San Francisco Giants' baseball stadium. At the end of September, her furlough turned into a permanent layoff.

But the $600 supplement expired at the end of July, and Congress has failed to agree on a plan to replace it. Ms. Mayer's state benefits ran out at the end of September -- the same week her job loss turned permanent -- and a 13-week federal extension will expire in December, leaving her with no income. Her partner, Steven Flamm, found a restaurant job in June, but at 25 hours a week, it isn't enough to sustain them both. ""All that I've built my whole life just got wiped out,"" Ms. Mayer said. ""I just don't know what my future is, and I think that's the scariest part."" The G.D.P. report released on Thursday doesn't break down the data by race, sex or income. But other sources make clear that the pandemic has taken a disproportionate toll on low-wage workers, particularly on Black and Hispanic women. Those workers bore the brunt of the job losses early in the crisis and have continued to struggle. Service-sector jobs have been slow to return, while school closings are keeping many parents, especially mothers, from returning to work. Nearly half a million Hispanic women have left the labor force over the last three months. Many white-collar professionals held on to their jobs and have been able to shore up their savings as they cut spending on vacations and restaurant meals during the pandemic. And while the stock market has fallen in recent days, it has recovered far more quickly than the economy as a whole. ""If we're thinking that the economy is recovering completely and uniformly, that is simply not the case,"" said Michelle Holder, an economist at John Jay College in New York. ""This rebound is unevenly distributed along racial and gender lines.""

Consumer spending on goods last quarter rose sharply, nearly 10 percent, more than enough to offset a relatively mild 2.8 percent decline in the spring. Spending on durable goods was particularly strong as Americans rushed to buy cars, recreational vehicles and equipment for their new homebound lifestyles. Spending on services, on the other hand, collapsed in the second quarter, falling 12.7 percent as consumers abandoned restaurant meals, gym classes and family vacations. Services spending rebounded 8.5 percent last quarter but remains 7.7 percent below its pre-pandemic level. Two Wisconsin businesses illustrate the diverging paths of the two sectors. When U.S. auto plants shut down last spring, it meant an immediate loss of business for Husco International, a manufacturer of hydraulic and electromechanical components for cars and other equipment. The company cut back production and furloughed many of its workers. But by the end of May, car factories were humming again, and Husco's business had begun to bounce back. In September, its automotive division had its best month on record. Austin Ramirez, the company's president and chief executive, said he still expected sales to be down about 10 percent for the full year. Despite September's strong results, the pandemic and the economic weakness it has wrought are dragging down demand. And the virus is causing other complications, leading to more employee absences. But the damage to his business is not nearly as severe as in the recession a decade ago.

""In a cyclical business like ours, this has actually been a fairly mild recession that we've had tools to manage,"" Mr. Ramirez said. For Becky Cooper, it is a different story. Bounce Milwaukee, the family entertainment center that she owns with her husband, shut down in March and has yet to reopen. They experimented over the summer with selling takeout pizza and offering drive-in movies in the parking lot, but sales weren't enough to offset costs. The couple began the year dreaming up plans for what they would do once they paid off the Small Business Administration loan they used to open the business six years ago. Instead, they had to drain their bank accounts and take on more debt. Now, with Covid-19 cases spiking in Wisconsin, they don't know when they will be able to welcome customers again -- or whether they can hold out until then. ""I'm watching those numbers go up and just feeling so powerless,"" Ms. Cooper said. ""The beginning of March seems almost insanely optimistic to me, and I don't see how much past that we could possibly go.""","Third-quarter growth set a record, fueled by federal assistance.

Television,"Amy Schumer Misses Stand-Up. ('I Should Have Said My Dad, but That's Not the Truth.')",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/arts/television/amy-schumer.html,"Amy Schumer Misses Stand-Up. ('I Should Have Said My Dad, but That's Not the Truth.')

It didn't take long for Amy Schumer to shut down her old life. ""The first day I heard the term Wuhan market, that was it,"" she said in a recent interview. ""I was one of those people who was like: Pack your bags."" Before long, she and her family had left New York and moved to Martha's Vineyard, where her husband, the chef Chris Fischer, is from. Her stand-up has obviously ceased, and a Hulu show has been put on pause. But she has been active, adjusting to the new limitations. ""Amy Schumer Learns to Cook,"" a weekly cooking show with her and her husband on the Food Network, premiered last week, and in July, her documentary about being pregnant as she prepared to make a comedy special will run on HBO Max. While her nearly 1-year-old son napped, she talked over Zoom about life under lockdown. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. If 10 is totally fine, I'm a 7. I'm worried about my dad, who is in assisted living where 15 people have died. My mom is alone. It's upsetting. And my friends who are nurses, a lot of them had it. But my day-to-day is nice. It's nice to have a baby, because it gives you a routine, and he doesn't know what's going on.

Your son Gene's middle name was Attell, in honor of the comic Dave Attell. But you recently changed it. Why? I was proud of that name. Then a month in, I'm looking on the computer at it and I started freaking out. Gene Attell. We named our baby Genital. A month later, I'm like: We got to change it. You can't name your son Genital. I didn't want to ""boy name Sue"" him. So now it's Gene David. What do you miss most from the pre-lockdown world? Stand-up. I should have said my dad, but that's not the truth.

These celebrities doing videos saying, ""Stay at home,"" and behind them is a moat and a diving board. There's a woman going, ""That's why we all need to shelter-in-palace."" Celebrity can be isolating. Does being famous prepare you for social distancing? It's dangerous to compare, because, whatever, but it is true. I don't know if you're watching ""The Last Dance."" I'm really enjoying it. I hadn't thought of the politics of the salaries and how the star can call all the shots. But also seeing Michael Jordan in and out of the hotel, in and out of the car. Very isolating life. You can't trust people. It feels like everyone feels that way now. That scene in the hotel alone at the height of his fame, Jordan looks sad. You're like: I don't know why I am feeling bad about this billionaire in a Four Seasons, but I am.

What else have you been watching during quarantine? I have been going to the live Instagrams of Questlove, D-Nice and Talib Kweli at night. Literally, I will put on a bra on so I can dance alone in my room and let myself feel present and feel good. Talib Kweli is playing the best hip-hop of the '90s. And I watched ""Normal People,"" a beautiful show. There's so much sex. I have a long game with Seinfeld. I told him to not read anything about it and just watch it. I'm just sitting waiting for it to pay off for a week and it hasn't. I'm like, What if he's just watching it with his family? It has so much sex. Did you watch Louis C.K.'s new special? Yes. I laughed at a lot of it. But it's hard to not think of what he done, what he has and hasn't learned, but I definitely laughed.

Woody Allen also released a book. Is the pandemic good for the problematic? It does seem like a safe time for the #MeToo guys. They are coming out of their foxholes. I don't want to be a person who eases anyone's way. I saw a stand-up comic tweet ""Imagine getting offended by jokes after"" all this. Do you think people will be offended by jokes less after the pandemic? No. It doesn't work that way. People will always get offended, and no, this is not this great equalizer. They'll get offended just as much, maybe more. Does being a parent change how you approach fear? It's all about that. For me, it's all about his safety, his comfort. It used to be [my husband] Chris. Now it goes Gene, then me, then Chris. I'll be running out of the burning house with Gene and be like: ""Is Chris and the dog here?"" When live comedy returns, will it look different? I think it will come back and be fine. But it will take a while. Are we going to open it up and people are going to wear bandannas over their mouths so you can't even hear a laugh? You need masks with good acoustics.

If someone sneezes while you're performing at a club, what's your reaction? I'll probably stop talking onstage and just leave. Actually, no, I'll throw the mic at the person who sneezed and run out the room scream-crying. Do you see clubs closing and careers ending from this? What are you going to do if you're making your living on the road? There are so many different outlets that the strong will survive. They'll pivot and evolve. Some comics are finding their footing in this space. Cole Escola, Megan Stalter -- there are these interesting comics that maybe wouldn't be seen by the audiences they are now. One way you are pivoting is doing a cooking show with your husband from your house. Why? A month ago, the Food Network reached out and said, ""Would you want to make a cooking show with your husband?"" We were like, ""Yeah, that will keep us busy."" We didn't even think about it. Then we left New York and started filming the next day. Isn't the point of marrying a chef that you don't have to learn how to cook? Exactly. I actually think it's shifting our dynamic a little. He's always been, ""She's the breadwinner, but I can keep the house going."" He keeps us nourished, but now I'm like: ""I can chop those. Are you going to make the wings or me?"" I think he's a little shook up. One thing you see from the show is, he's a tough laugh. Not just laugh. He's a tough smile. But when you get him laughing, it feels really good.

Does the pandemic bring people together or reveal our divisions? Both. The divide is clearer. I used to have this urge to bridge. But it's so out of control and impossible. Someone who thinks we should be allowed to leave our houses and do whatever we want is, I guess, a Trump person. I've tried to understand what the thinking is, but I don't have the capability of changing anyone's mind. I wish them the best, and they don't have to worry about me trying to have a conversation. Is there anything good that comes out of this pandemic? No one's going ""Worth it!"" More people dead than Vietnam. Worth it! But there are totally beautiful parts to this. Every day I text with my girlfriends from back home. We just stop and share memories. And we don't really talk about Covid or what's going on. We just want to talk about who gave the most unnecessary blow job and when we tried our first cigarette, and who was the worst drunk. Keeping it light. Just old memories. Just giving time to our memories. I'm just enjoying thinking about different times.","Because of coronavirus concerns, she expects it will be at least a year before she returns to Comedy Cellar: ""You need masks with good acoustics.""",5e3d6c76-911f-5392-ba50-e8df32ed054f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/arts/24amy-schumer5/24amy-schumer5-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b2a83d9f8a40d3b82b1410fb93396a362d62d010418ca6d30d343e0f98eb585d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Amy Schumer as seen through FaceTime.

Travel,"Finally, You Can Have Breakfast at Tiffany",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/travel/tiffany-and-co-jewelry-breakfast-audrey-hepburn.html,"There are certain movie scenes that are so iconic that they still retain their importance in the pop-culture lexicon, even decades later. When Holly Golightly, played by Audrey Hepburn, stepped out of a yellow cab and sauntered to the window of Tiffany & Co. in the 1961 film ""Breakfast at Tiffany's,"" with Henry Mancini and Johnny Mercer's ""Moon River"" playing in the background, such a scene was created.

As Holly ate a croissant and carried a cup of coffee, she was still, unfortunately, on the outside of the building. Since 1837, Tiffany's has been a preeminent luxury jeweler and not a place where you could actually have breakfast. However, that changed on Friday, with the opening of the Blue Box Cafe, at the company's venerable flagship store at Fifth Avenue and 57th Street in New York City. Menu items will be seasonal and reflect a sophisticated take on a variety of New York dishes.

Located on the fourth floor of the building, which houses a recently renovated home and accessories section, the cafe is a bright, airy space, with the ""Breakfast at Tiffany"" breakfast starting at $29. The offering comes with coffee or tea, followed by a croissant and seasonal fruit and rounded out with your choice of a buttermilk waffle, smoked salmon and bagel stack, truffle eggs, or avocado toast.","Tiffany & Co. opened the first-ever café at its flagship New York store, where visitors can now have breakfast and channel Audrey Hepburn.",93fbff74-67e4-574d-b9e5-bbfee8e487de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/travel/10tiffany1/10tiffany1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a21e55f5a1b41efbaa85759719125b550f9101a98b50e5bd33e534e7995ee464&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Blue Box Café at the flagship Tiffany &amp; Co. store in New York City.,93fbff74-67e4-574d-b9e5-bbfee8e487de,N24News/imgs/93fbff74-67e4-574d-b9e5-bbfee8e487de.jpg,4
Movies,'Stargirl' Review: A Familiar but Charming Romance,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/movies/stargirl-review.html,"A strange magic seems to follow Stargirl; the football team starts winning games, the marching band starts playing in tune and Leo starts to fall in love. (She also has a crate of very good vinyl, which is magical to a certain segment of viewers.)

""Stargirl"" was published twenty years ago, and its age occasionally shows in this adaptation; some of the story beats and character qualities (particularly those of the rather precious title character) have congealed into cliche. But Hart (who wrote the screenplay with Kristin Hahn and Jordan Horowitz) is such an enchanting filmmaker, her storytelling style so warm and welcoming, that those concerns fade -- particularly in the picture's second half, as her characters' interactions and motivations become more complex.

When his classmates inevitably turn on Stargirl, Leo pleads, ""Why can't you just be more like everyone else?"" She gives it her best, but to no avail, and here is where the film's message becomes clear: nothing is more important than being one's true self.

Travel,Tips for Parents of Children Flying Solo,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/travel/children-flying-solo-kids-parents-tips.html,"Last week, an unaccompanied 15-year-old traveling from London to meet his grandparents in France was bumped from an oversold easyJet flight and essentially treated as an adult, left to deal with rebooking on his own, according to a report by the BBC. Though the incident ended with the boy taking a flight 10 hours later, it underscores a weakness in a system designed to care for children unaccustomed to advocating for themselves. Experts emphasize the importance of educating children before their trip. ""Even if it's an older teen flying to soccer camp, they need to learn to speak up and explain that they're 16 and on their own and can't be stranded in an airport,"" said Eileen Ogintz, who has the syndicated column and website Taking the Kids. ""Play the what-if game. What if you're canceled? What if you're diverted? What if you're stranded?"" Even when children are adequately prepared with those answers, the protocol for flying solo is not uniform. Because there are no Transportation Department regulations regarding travel by unaccompanied minors, airlines create their own policies, beginning with who can fly. Here are tips for familiarizing yourself with guidelines established by airlines.

Many American carriers offer services for children designated solo fliers like select seats and airline escorts on and off the plane, and to connecting gates. Most airlines consider solo fliers from the ages of 5 to 15 as unaccompanied minors, though Southwest Airlines puts the upper limit at 11 and JetBlue Airways at 13. American Airlines and Delta Air Lines make the designation optional for children 15 to 17. (For those ages, parents can let the kids fly without designating them unaccompanied minors and forfeit the additional care.) It is optional on Alaska Airlines for passengers 13 to 17. Additional fees for unaccompanied minors vary as well. It costs $25 each way for direct flights on Alaska and $50 for one-way itineraries involving connections. Southwest charges $50 a flight. On JetBlue, the service costs $100 one way, and American, Delta and United Airlines all charge $150 each way. Different fees may apply to multiple children traveling together. For example, American Airlines only charges one unaccompanied minor fee for parties of two or more, and Delta charges one fee for up to four children traveling together. For those fees, children are usually promised a seat close to the front of the plane. Airline agents will escort minors to their seats, again when they deplane, and to connecting gates. Not all flights are available to children traveling alone. Many carriers limit younger children to nonstop or direct flights. Delta allows 8- to 14-year-olds to make connections, assisted by an employee. American Airlines allows connecting services, with an escort between flights, at several of its busier airports, including its hubs in Chicago, Dallas and New York.

At the airport check-in desk, parents with government-issued identification can obtain a pass that allows them to escort the minor to the gate. Some airlines require them to stay at the airport until the plane has taken off, and most experts advise doing so in case the plane experiences a mechanical problem or delay and must return to the terminal. At the arrival airport, most airlines will similarly issue a gate pass to the person designated to pick up the minor, allowing the person to meet the child at the arrival gate. To better track unaccompanied minors, Delta has instituted a system that relies on bar-coded wristbands that are scanned at way points in the journey. The airline has said that it intends to make that data available to parents and custodians. Experts recommend parents prepare children for flight as they would themselves, including sending them off with identification such as a birth certificate or a passport. Pack a water bottle to fill after passing through security; some form of entertainment, like books or a tablet computer with an extra battery booster; a fleece or sweater for chilly flights; and food. ""Send the equivalent of a school lunch,"" Ms. Ogintz of Taking the Kids said. ""Chances are there's not much food."" In the lead-up to the trip, position it as an adventure to ease anxieties. Rainer Jenss, the president and founder of the Family Travel Association, a group that advocates travel as educational, suggests involving children in planning flights to make them feel empowered, and accentuating the positives to get them excited. ""Compliment the child on what a big boy or girl they are,"" he said. ""Emphasize how they can now be trusted and how grown up they are. Talk about how fun flying is. How they can get somewhere so fast without having to go on a long, boring car ride."" Finally, just because children can fly solo doesn't mean all of them should. ""If they're truly nervous, wait until they're older,"" Ms. Ogintz said.

But They Speak to Us Now.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/theater/greek-tragedy-germany.html,"MUNICH -- When it comes to misery, the families in Greek tragedies really take the cake. The unhappy offspring of the houses of Atreus and Thebes are some of the oldest protagonists of world drama: They have relived their traumas onstage continually since the fifth century B.C., both in the original plays and in adaptations that draw psychological insights and contemporary relevance from the ancient texts. Throughout Germany this season, ambitious modern reinventions of plays by Sophocles and Aeschylus argue for the universality and timelessness of these works. Now in his last year as artistic director of the Residenztheater in Munich, Martin Kusej has invited back Ulrich Rasche, the visionary director whose 2017 production of Schiller's ""The Robbers"" was one of the triumphs of Mr. Kusej's eight-year tenure. And Mr. Rasche, 50, has once again brought his distinctive brand of ""machine theater,"" which transforms the stage into an elaborate mechanical assemblage while treating the actors as cogs in an all-consuming apparatus, this time for a production of ""Elektra,"" adapted from Sophocles' tragedy in 1903 by the Austrian writer Hugo von Hofmannsthal. In ""The Robbers,"" massive, continually rolling treadmills dominated the stage, in a production as dramatically gripping as it was technically ingenious. For this one-act ""Elektra,"" Mr. Rasche, who designs his own productions, has devised an even more sophisticated set. The action takes place on a raised disc that rotates on its axis and on which, safely harnessed, the actors march in a pack, fighting to stay in place as it is raised and lowered, often tilting at dangerous angles. Unfortunately, one walks away dazzled by the mechanics but underwhelmed by the drama. Much of the problem lies with how Mr. Rasche lets the rhythm of the production be dictated by Monika Roscher's throbbing score, performed live by six capable musicians. ""The Robbers"" benefited from a pulsating soundtrack by the American composer Ari Benjamin Meyers that sustained a mesmerizing intensity over four hours. Sadly, in ""Elektra,"" a work half as long, both the individual performances and the production as a whole seem enslaved to the loud, droning music.

This is especially true of Katja Burkle's raw portrayal of Elektra, the daughter of the murdered king, Agamemnon. Mr. Rasche's ritualistic staging is ill suited to a work of such emotional intensity. Amid the monotonous score and the chanting by the chorus (the director's invention), Ms. Burkle drools and howls while trudging along the spinning disc. Her performance is impressively feral, but not much more than that. The center of Hofmannsthal's version is the showdown between Elektra and her mother, Clytemnestra, who killed her husband when he returned triumphant from the Trojan War. It's a bloodcurdling scene, but here the plodding tempo set by the music makes it fall flat. Perhaps Mr. Rasche hoped to build Hitchcockian tension and suspense. In the absence of a ticking bomb under a table, however, the long scene just stagnates and dies. It is a directorial miscalculation that nearly sinks the whole production. One of the few bright spots is Lilith Hassle as Elektra's life-affirming sister, Chrysothemis, a necessary foil to the vengeful title character. Only when Ms. Hassle tries to supplicate the imperious Ms. Burkle, honestly pouring out her maternal desires to Elektra's derision and scorn, does Mr. Rasche's industrially rigorous ""machine theater"" succeed on an emotional, human level.

The vengeance of the children of Agamemnon is also the theme of ""The Oresteia,"" the only tragic trilogy passed down to us from antiquity. In Burkhard C. Kosminski's first season leading the Schauspiel Stuttgart, in southern Germany, he has brought over the British director Robert Icke's acclaimed four-hour version for its German-language premiere. The handsome 2015 production, originally seen at the Almeida Theater in London, where Mr. Ickes is associate director, has arrived in Stuttgart with only minor changes to Hildegard Bechtler's minimalistic brick-and-glass set.

Over the course of a long but gripping evening, the fall of the house of Atreus plays out on a sleekly modern set, which transforms from a suburban home to a courtroom in the cycle's final installment, ""The Eumenides."" As the matricidal Orestes reconstructs the bloody events leading to his trial, a clerk presents the evidence to the court, where it is dutifully relayed in print on an electronic console. Despite the contemporary relocation, Mr. Icke's version remains faithful to Aeschylus. To make the plays work in a modern context, the trilogy is mostly stripped of its religious trappings. Without the context of the Hellenic belief system, the faith that compels Agamemnon to sacrifice his daughter Iphigenia comes across as superstition, although Mr. Icke clearly lays out the moral stakes in sacrificing a child to win a war. In this version, the character who comes most clearly into focus is Clytemnestra, the mourning queen, who will take revenge on Agamemnon only to be killed by her son. The German actress Sylvana Krappatsch ensures that the focus stays on her, thanks to a courageous performance that is ferocious, grief-stricken and sexually charged. Matthias Leja is her worthy partner, and later opponent, as a severe yet uncommonly sympathetic Agamemnon. The others in the 12-member cast have less to do. As Orestes, Peer Oscar Musinowski looks panic-stricken and flummoxed as he works through the traumatic memories and defends himself at his final trial, while Anne-Marie Lux seems positively chipper as Elektra compared with Ms. Burkle in Munich. Mr. Icke's meticulous direction is full of disconcerting, often freaky, touches, including a spooked Iphigenia (Aniko Sophie Huber and Salome Sophie Roller alternate in the role) singing the most unsettling version of the Beach Boys' ""God Only Knows"" you'll ever hear while clutching a stuffed bunny. Mr. Icke is also fond of cinematic touches that recall David Lynch during climactic moments, such as the frosted glass dividers that turn transparent at the blink of an eye, accompanied by flashing light and a zapping noise.

In what was his first postwar work for the stage, Brecht turned his attention to Sophocles' tragedy about filial duty, civil disobedience and the tyranny of the state. Based on an 1804 translation by the early German Romantic poet Friedrich Holderlin, Brecht's concentrated version was intended as an indictment of the German bourgeoisie who had embraced Hitler. Brecht scrubbed the play clean of references to Greek deities and shifted the emphasis away from one family's personal tragedy to the downfall of a society that embraces a totalitarian system. On the small stage of the Berliner Ensemble, the company in Berlin founded by Brecht in 1949, Veit Schubert directs a stripped-down production of this ""Antigone"" starring students at the Ernst Busch University of Performing Arts. The nine actors clamber on and around a sloping stage that, over the course of the 90-minute performance, is progressively assembled from squares locking noisily into a large frame. (Wiebke Bachmann designed the striking modular set.) The cast -- all in their early to mid-20s -- perform with sweaty determination, if a touch too much studied intensity. A notable exception is Aniol Kirberg, who plays the blind seer Tiresias as a cheeky balladeer, plucking out bluesy tunes on a variety of instruments and annoying the tyrant Creon by parroting his pronouncements in song. The performances in the 200-seat theater are mostly sold out, which is a vote both for the next generation of Berlin thespians and for these foundational works of world literature. Surely directors and playwrights like Hofmannsthal, Brecht and Mr. Icke will not be the last to mine them for fresh insight into our values, our morals, our fears and our passions.","Throughout Germany, ambitious modern reinventions of plays by Sophocles and Aeschylus argue for the timelessness of these ancient works.",7b4b705c-a821-5117-8b99-f932e9208c77,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/14/arts/14berlintheater01/14berlintheater01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2a85fe5e72bd377144daab978a1dedb3c5b235de287d1630ee5f31c279809558&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Katja Bürkle in the title role with the chorus in ""Elektra"" at the Residenztheater in Munich.",7b4b705c-a821-5117-8b99-f932e9208c77,N24News/imgs/7b4b705c-a821-5117-8b99-f932e9208c77.jpg,10
Real Estate,The Return of Home Renovations,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/realestate/coronavirus-home-renovations.html,"Gail Eisen was in the middle of combining two apartments in a co-op building on Sutton Place in late March, when the coronavirus prompted the shutdown of all nonessential construction projects for more than two months. ""When the workers left, with a few weeks to go before completing the job, they left in a hurry,"" said Ms. Eisen, a retired television news producer. ""They left neat piles of all their tools -- 7-by-7-foot piles. ""But they're back now,"" she added, ""and the buzz saw is music to my ears."" Almost a month after the phase 1 reopening of New York City that allowed contractors and their crews back into residential buildings, ""we're redefining what 'full steam ahead' means,"" said Steve Mark, the chief executive of SMI Construction. ""It's not going to mean what it used to."" Regular cleaning and disinfecting of the job site is mandated by New York state to help contain the spread of Covid-19. Before hammers can start swinging or walls painted, contractors, as directed by state mandates, must fill out a welter of forms. They must outfit job sites with, among other things, sanitation stations and signage that reminds workers -- properly masked, of course -- to maintain an appropriate social distance and to wash their hands frequently.

But the state guidelines don't stop there. Contractors and their employees must also be mindful of a whole host of other rules for home improvement during a pandemic: no more than one worker per 250 square feet; open windows whenever possible to increase ventilation; daily temperature checks before employees report to the job site; work stations must be cleaned and disinfected regularly; tightly confined spaces, like elevators, are to operate at no more than half capacity. While some co-ops and condos require only that contractors and their crews hew to the state's mandatory and ""best practices"" protocols, plenty of buildings have their own lists of dos and don'ts, their own documents for contractors to sign. Some buildings are insisting that once on the job site in the morning, workers must remain there for the entire day to limit foot traffic. Some are trimming the number of hours that crews can be in residence daily, say from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. rather than the pre-Covid 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. ""And that includes the time it takes to get from the street up the elevator and back down,"" Mr. Mark said. ""Under the new rules and guidelines, renovations will absolutely take more time to complete."" A Covid-19 rider to the standard alteration agreement issued by an Upper West Side co-op has two dozen provisions, among them, an addendum that allows for modification of the project schedule ""taking into consideration that other occupants are working and/or schooling from home.""

Protocols from Orsid New York, a property management company, call for contractors to pick up and sanitize any Masonite (a floorboard mainstay of construction sites) at the end of the day, and to let building superintendents know when they're leaving for the day. ""That way the staff will know to clean the panels of the service elevator,"" said Robbie Janowitz, Orsid's senior vice president. Meanwhile, a condo in the West Village is directing contractors to disinfect the service elevator and service entrance three times daily, a cleaning that must include misting with an electrostatic sanitize sprayer to neutralize germs. ""The product must be presented and approved by the resident manager,"" reads a document issued by the building. However effective electrostatic spray guns may be, some buildings are none too keen about the prospect of reopening their doors to contractors. At least not yet and maybe not for a good long while. ""People think Cuomo is the highest authority, but in New York City the co-op board is the highest authority,"" said Marc Kerner, a general contractor and the owner of the company Infinity Construction. ""And some boards are nervous."" Workers at One Management Partners, a cleaning service, suit up before heading to a construction site. Thus, some buildings may be allowing work that was in progress before the shutdown to go forward but are putting the kibosh on new renovation projects until next year. Some buildings are restricting the number of projects that can go on at any one time, Mr. Janowitz said. Others are limiting the scope of alterations -- allowing small projects like paint jobs and cabinetry installations, but giving a thumbs down to alterations that require demolition. ""Co-op boards want to make it less noisy for people who are quarantining,"" said Steve Wagner, a real estate lawyer.

The demographics of a building may help explain a board's caution, said Melissa Cafiero, the director of compliance at Halstead Management. ""Some condos and co-ops may have a lot of residents who frequently travel internationally and there's a lot of turnover with sub-letters so they've put a full stop in place on renovations,"" she said. ""And there are buildings that had a lot of confirmed Covid cases early on, which has made them more restrictive."" Boards' decision-making is also being colored by the number of elderly residents and otherwise vulnerable people in their buildings. ""You have to balance health concerns and the effect of the operation of the co-op or condo with the needs of the people who are in the middle of a renovation,"" said John Janangelo, the executive managing director at Douglas Elliman Property Management.","Contractors have been allowed to go back to work since early June, but coronavirus protocols will probably make any apartment renovation take longer than usual.",9a0ddfc1-d359-54c8-830b-5804e8fc8e66,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/05/realestate/02REOPEN-RENOVATIONS/02REOPEN-RENOVATIONS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5b6fa2dc4c6875e8cd82bf0763e5f436f6f2dddfa681c7697fd76ac44cd22289&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A doorman at a Fifth Avenue apartment building does a temperature check of contractors before allowing them to start their work day.,9a0ddfc1-d359-54c8-830b-5804e8fc8e66,N24News/imgs/9a0ddfc1-d359-54c8-830b-5804e8fc8e66.jpg,7
Real Estate,Luxury Condos on Brooklyn's Fourth Avenue,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/realestate/luxury-condos-on-brooklyns-fourth-avenue.html,"Carlo A. Scissura, the president of the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce, has a grand vision for the borough's Fourth Avenue, which for decades was a dreary boulevard where you were more likely to get your tires replaced or buy a cheap mattress than eat a fine meal or find a luxury apartment.

""Fourth Avenue could be the Park Avenue of Brooklyn,"" said Mr. Scissura, who started a task force in 2011 that pushed for the revitalization of the corridor while he was chief of staff to Marty Markowitz, then the Brooklyn Borough President.

Changes have indeed come to the avenue, which stretches some six miles from Atlantic Avenue to near the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. Various traffic calming and safety measures by the Department of Transportation have been implemented. Zoning changes have prompted a batch of large rental and condominium buildings to sprout on the corridor in the last several years, giving many parts of the avenue a cleaner, more inviting look.

""We still need more trees, better lighting and more retail,"" Mr. Scissura said.

Developers that one might expect to see building on Park Avenue rather than on Fourth Avenue are starting to sign on to Mr. Scissura's vision. The JDS Development Group, a Manhattan-based developer of high-end condominiums and rentals, will start sales for its 11-story, 44-unit condo on the corner of Baltic Street and Fourth Avenue in early March, said Jodi Stasse, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which is handling sales for the building.","Sales are about to begin at the Baltic, an 11-story condominium rising on the corner of Baltic Street and Fourth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn.",9a32fd5c-8394-5ae6-9b39-f3856a363e21,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/07/realestate/07BALTIC/07BALTIC-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=cd1d8201dbd113889b1e277b85292be1dc2bbfe2d785ca6924436a6921850d06&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sales are about to begin at the 11-story Baltic, at 613 Baltic Street.",9a32fd5c-8394-5ae6-9b39-f3856a363e21,N24News/imgs/9a32fd5c-8394-5ae6-9b39-f3856a363e21.jpg,7
Science,Corals May Have a Taste for Dangerous Plastic,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/science/corals-plastic-taste.html,"The ocean is full of plastic. Eight million tons are dumped in the seas every year. Plastic bags have been found in the guts of dead sea turtles, which mistake them for jellyfish. More than 200 species have been documented eating plastic, which looks colorful and edible but can kill them.

In lab experiments, even tiny corals, the organisms that make up reefs, have been observed nibbling on a confetti of broken down plastic fragments similar to what swirls through the depths. But they aren't just eating whatever floats by. Instead, according to a new study in Marine Pollution Bulletin, some of the chemicals infused in the plastic may actually taste like food to the corals.

It isn't yet clear how much plastic is consumed by corals in the wild, or what harm it might do to these important marine organisms, which are already threatened by environmental dangers like warming seas and pollution. But understanding why plastic might appeal to them is important, especially because some particles appear to get stuck in the corals, potentially disrupting their digestive process.

Hundreds of chemicals are mixed into plastics to achieve certain textures or other characteristics. Because the corals sense the presence of food with receptors, it would not be all that surprising if some chemical additives mimicked substances that set off the corals' appetites, suggested Alexander Seymour and Austin Allen, who were both graduate students at Duke University when they led this study.","In lab experiments, the organisms that make up reefs were observed nibbling on a confetti of broken down plastic fragments, and they seemed to be choosy.",fe55a713-0c7a-55f1-8b6b-e22898d8c167,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/07/science/01TB-CORALS1/01TB-CORALS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=55dd2a9204a4fe3dc5a8c1269fc0f5cd40958f94b857738ddb347d5c13337ed8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A small colony of Astrangia poculata, or northern star coral, capturing and ingesting a plastic particle.",fe55a713-0c7a-55f1-8b6b-e22898d8c167,N24News/imgs/fe55a713-0c7a-55f1-8b6b-e22898d8c167.jpg,2
Movies,When Life Looks Like a Wes Anderson Movie,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/movies/wes-anderson-design-buildings.html,"Among the images in the book ""Accidentally Wes Anderson"" is this view of Roberts Cottages in Oceanside, Calif.





This article is part of our latest Design special report, which is about taking creative leaps in challenging times. The last shelters on the Marangu route to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro are little structures known as Kibo huts, the first built in 1932. When Robert Hune-Kalter, a Colorado-based bank employee, reached the huts, in July 2019, he might have been thinking of nothing but scrambling to the top of Africa's highest peak. But he found himself admiring their triangular shapes with their steep, green-painted gables and vertical black siding. ""I liked how symmetrical it was,"" he said, ""and even mentioned to my friend that it reminded me of the symmetry of a Wes Anderson scene."" After descending, he sent a hut photo to the Instagram account ""Accidentally Wes Anderson,"" where it joined pictures of pointy roofs taken in Wildwood, N.J.; Siglufjordur, Iceland; and Whitehorse, the capital of Canada's Yukon Territory. All these places resembled alternative sets for Mr. Anderson's 2012 film ""Moonrise Kingdom,"" a golden-toned story of young love set against rocky shores, lighthouses and scout camping tents.

Wally Koval, the founder of ""Accidentally Wes Anderson,"" calls the account's more than one million followers ""Adventurers."" But while it takes you to the top (Kilimanjaro) and bottom (Goudier Island, Antarctica) of the world, it also frames architectural bonbons closer to civilization and provides inspiration for your own homes, which might do with a dash of dreaminess in these dreary times. The adventure is in finding real places that look like they could be in the films, Mr. Koval writes in the introduction to a book based on the Instagram that is due out in October and also called ""Accidentally Wes Anderson."" Written by Mr. Koval and his wife, Amanda Koval, and published by Voracious, an imprint of Little, Brown, the book includes images of Airstream trailers and retro rail cars, viewfinders and glamorous pools, all captured by 182 international (and largely amateur) photographers. Mr. Hune-Kalter's Kibo hut photo appears on page 251, along with a short history of Kilimanjaro mountaineering.

Perhaps most amazing of all, Mr. Anderson has blessed the project and, it seems, been inspired by the idea of doing a little adventuring himself. As the director writes in his foreword, ""The photographs in this book were taken by people I have never met, of places and things I have, almost without exception, never seen -- but I must say: I intend to."" Mr. Koval, 36, a former content marketer, initially spotted locations that looked as if they could be in a Wes Anderson movie on a subreddit in 2017. He reposted the pictures to his personal Instagram as visual notes for his own travel intentions. He has tried to maintain the sense of shared visual language and discovery, even as the Instagram feed has blossomed into a brand of its own. ""I have lost count of the amount of times my friends have said, 'Oh Claire, that's so Accidentally,'"" said Claire Walker (@thesilvercherry), a London careers adviser who discovered the account, accidentally of course, in 2017. ""I think I can safely say that I was taking Accidentallyesque photos before I discovered the AWA platform."" What makes an Accidentally photo? Steeples, lighthouses, theaters, wedding-cake hotels, outdated technology and, most predictably, the color pink, so rarely seen in typical architectural discourse. Matt Zoller Seitz, New York magazine's television critic and the author of two books on Mr. Anderson's work, said he believed that the Instagram feed helped to fill a gap. ""One of the things I constantly harp on in my criticism is I wish more film and TV critics would pay attention to form as well as content,"" he said. ""The Wes Anderson fan base is interested in both, and they understand the filmmaker's style and personality so well they can be walking around out there in the world and say, 'Oh that looks like a Wes Anderson shot.'""

Mr. Seitz has done it himself, having once being seized by the mirror-image symmetry in a hotel lobby in Montreal. The irony, he said, is that most of Mr. Anderson's recent films have been shot on sets, not in the real world, so the Adventurers are finding visual order amid global chaos. ""People say he is a control-freak director,"" Mr. Seitz said of Mr. Anderson. ""His characters are obsessed with everything being just so. But in the end the lesson is that is not possible."" Or, as the Instagram suggests, only possible for the moment of tapping the camera button. Then the wind shifts, the people move, the symmetry is lost.

The same stillness that arrests the eye while watching a film stops the swiping finger on Instagram. ""On social media, nothing stands out until you get to that Wes Anderson symmetrical shot,"" said Jeffrey Czum (@jeffreyczum), who works for a tech start-up in Buffalo and contributed the image of a faded shell-pink lighthouse on the uninhabited Caribbean island of Little Curacao on page 72. ""The viewer knows exactly where to look. You don't have to question; you don't have to overthink."" ""It's like being a traveler every morning,"" said Matthew Dickey (@_madickey_), another follower. ""Where are we going to go today?"" Mr. Dickey, who is the communications and operations manager for the Boston Preservation Alliance, sees a parallel between his work ""trying to tell stories of places in Boston"" and what happens Accidentally.

""You might not be able to find the beauty in a Boston triple-decker,"" he said, referring to a type of apartment building, ""but you can pull into a detail of the architecture, a pastel-colored door, the wallpaper you find inside, a historic stairwell. AWA gets people to explore and see the details and stories a bit more deeply."" In this time of quarantine, the lush book, with the photos clustered geographically, reads even more strongly as a wish list. Right now, ""You can't travel but you can explore the stuff around you,"" Mr. Koval said. ""Literally four miles away from here"" -- his current home in a cottage in rural New Jersey -- ""there is a lake that has an island that has a church on it from the 1800s."" Thanks to a tip from an Adventurer, the Kovals think they have a way to access the private lake, planting a virtual flag on another site that could be straight out of Wes Anderson.","An Instagram platform, now a book, documents real-life settings that look like frames from the director's movies.",f269f073-7550-5b21-afd0-7246f13ac537,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/01/style/01sp-anderson7/01sp-anderson7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=62290025823f888db445ad6791709f9995026177122ac36213388afa5696f8f4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Among the images in the book &ldquo;Accidentally Wes Anderson&rdquo; is this view of Roberts Cottages in Oceanside, Calif.",f269f073-7550-5b21-afd0-7246f13ac537,N24News/imgs/f269f073-7550-5b21-afd0-7246f13ac537.jpg,5
Dance,"Beyoncé, Ballet and Points Between: A Choreographer Calmly Covers the Waterfront",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/arts/dance/sidi-larbi-cherkaoui-medusa-royal-ballet.html,"Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui at the Royal Opera House. ""I always use the bodies in front of me for what they can offer,"" he says.

LONDON -- ""You have to be clear about where the movement is starting and where it's going,"" Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui said mildly as a group of Royal Ballet men struggled with a backward roll that involved scissoring legs and a one-knee landing. ""You would be surprised how much weight needs to be on the elbow as you roll back."" The men tried it again. They were surprised. After the rehearsal, Mr. Cherkaoui said he is always interested in how to think about movement. ""Ballet is often taught as the reproduction of positions,"" he said, ""but everything is much richer if the body is responding to thought and intention and imagination."" It was less than a week before the premiere, on Wednesday, of Mr. Cherkaoui's new dance, ""Medusa,"" for the Royal Ballet. But the choreographer, Mr. Serenity, was showing no signs of urgency or pressure, even though he had a plane to catch. That's usual for him -- a serious multitasker, he is in perpetual motion between countries and projects. This time he was off to Munich, where he is directing and choreographing the Gluck opera ""Alceste."" Mr. Cherkaoui, 43, a Belgian choreographer of Flemish and Morrocan parentage, has been an important presence on the dance scene since the early 2000s, collaborating frequently with A-list artists across disciplines, like Antony Gormley and Marina Abramovic. But Mr. Cherkaoui, whose teenage dance ambitions came from watching Prince and Janet Jackson videos, is now sought after by both major pop stars and major ballet companies. Over the last several years, he has choreographed for the Cirque du Soleil; directed operas and plays; choreographed films, worked with the Icelandic rock band Sigur Ros and the singer Woodkid, and choreographed the Alanis Morissette musical, ""Jagged Little Pill,"" which is heading to Broadway in November.

And one more small thing -- since 2015, he has also been the director of the Royal Ballet of Flanders. ""It takes a village,"" Mr. Cherkaoui said calmly, gesturing to his ballet master, Jason Kittelberger, who had been running the Royal Ballet rehearsal, issuing a stream of corrections and clarifications. ""As artists, we are lucky when we have people who understand our work and support our vision."" And sometimes, he added, ""you support other people's visions,"" as he did when collaborating with Beyonce and her team. ""I understand well what they are going for, and then it's a matter of making suggestions,"" he said. ""The hip sequence, the Martha Graham contractions, those come from me. But it's all about whether Beyonce connects to the idea, and then it's up to her and Jay-Z.""

Despite running a ballet company -- and his many commissions for ballet companies -- Mr. Cherkaoui is still largely seen as a contemporary dance-maker. His distinctive physical style melds a silky slipperiness with street and contemporary dance forms, often combined with stylized, repetitive gesture and speech. ""I started ballet classes when I was 17, and I have always watched it because I am influenced by its physical possibilities,"" he said, seeming half-amused, half-pained by the idea that he is seen as an outsider in the ballet world. ""I always use the bodies in front of me for what they can offer.""

""Medusa,"" Mr. Cherkaoui's first work for the Royal Ballet, set to songs by Purcell and an electronic score by the composer Olga Wojciechowska, is nonetheless a departure for him. ""I come from a very contemporary point of view,"" he said, explaining his more usual narrative strategies: ""Multiple points of view, giving the audience space for interpretation, making it layered. When everything is linear, I am afraid it will be too boring or simple or easy. But I felt, Come on Larbi, you have to try this."" He chose the myth of Medusa, he said, because he was looking for a strong character for Natalia Osipova, the Royal Ballet star who has worked with Mr. Cherkaoui before. ""She is daring and fearless, and you can ask her to do anything,"" he said. He wanted to find her a character who would have ""a certain history and ambiguity."" The story, as related by Ovid in ""Metamorphoses,"" describes Medusa as a beautiful handmaiden in the temple of Athena who is transformed into a snake-headed monster by the goddess after she is raped by the sea god Poseidon.

Mr. Cherkaoui said he was well aware that showing a rape onstage could be contentious. ""I don't want to diminish rape -- it has happened inside my family,"" he said. ""I can relate, as an Arab and a gay guy, to issues around sexuality and power, having something happen to you as a stigma."" What was interesting in the Medusa story, he added, is that the character is galvanized by her punishment. ""Athena makes her a monster, but also extremely powerful, able to punish in turn, the men who did nothing to save her from Poseidon.""

Kevin O'Hare, the director of the Royal Ballet, said he had discussed the way the rape would be presented with Mr. Cherkaoui. ""You can't pretend it's not part of the story, but it's not gratuitous, and with the choreographic language that Larbi uses, it doesn't have the same connotations it might have in a more contemporary context,"" he said, alluding to the controversy around Kenneth MacMillan's 1992 ""The Judas Tree."" Mr. O'Hare said he was a longtime admirer of Mr. Cherkaoui's work. ""I love the fluidity of his style and the intricacies of the arm work,"" he said. He noted that Mr. Cherkaoui's use of the upper body ""isn't so far away"" from the choreography of Frederick Ashton, which is characterized by (among other things) a pliant, bendy torso. ""I think it really suits what we do."" The movement is nonetheless demanding for ballet dancers in subtle and not-so-subtle ways. ""One of the hard things is the partnering, when the body really rests on another body and they fold around each other,"" Mr. Kittelberger said. ""Ballet dancers try instinctively to help one another here, to use their arms to share the weight, instead of really letting the other person take it, which is what Larbi wants.""","The unflappable Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, who works across an impressive range of forms, has made a new dance for Natalia Osipova and the Royal Ballet.",a9e2e198-42c6-53dc-b983-3e3f90350fae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/08/arts/08sidilarbi1/07sidilarbi1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d85e4e12876f7ac0d28b1f6b49327d1e7f2650a147f4c4028da52741ba2f02f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui at the Royal Opera House. &ldquo;I always use the bodies in front of me for what they can offer,&rdquo; he says.",a9e2e198-42c6-53dc-b983-3e3f90350fae,N24News/imgs/a9e2e198-42c6-53dc-b983-3e3f90350fae.jpg,6
Books,That Other Clinton: A Brief Biography of Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/books/review/bill-clinton-biography-michael-tomasky.html,"What biographer could possibly envy Michael Tomasky? As part of the American Presidents series edited by Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., who died in 2007, and Sean Wilentz, Tomasky drew the assignment of squeezing the life and times of William Jefferson Clinton into a volume ""compact enough for the busy reader,"" as Schlesinger put it. This is an easy enough task, say, in the case of William Henry Harrison, who served for just one month before dying of pneumonia, considerately allowing his biographer in this series, Gail Collins, to focus on his far more eventful and boisterous campaign.

Clinton did not perish during his presidency, but as Tomasky aptly observes in ""Bill Clinton,"" ""his most notable accomplishment was simply surviving."" Nothing underscores that feat better than the fact that Clinton was one of only two presidents to be impeached (he, like Andrew Johnson, was acquitted by the Senate).

Tomasky's invaluable contribution is to remind us just how much Clinton did accomplish during his presidency -- and how much achievements like Nafta and welfare reform depended on him slicing deals to attract enough Republican votes to offset Democratic opponents in Congress. Tomasky is especially strong on the economic anxieties of the Democratic voter that propelled Clinton to victory and remained a priority for him during his presidency, which, as Tomasky points out in his epilogue, makes it even more mystifying that Hillary Clinton failed to capitalize on those same anxieties in the 2016 presidential campaign, as Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump did.

If Tomasky has a blind spot, it is his handling of Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He calls Clinton's behavior ""unfathomably irresponsible,"" and details how the conservative media stoked the news. Yet in his argument that the furor was largely disproportionate to the relationship, Tomasky blames the ""rages"" of Howell Raines, then the Times editorial page editor, and several of the paper's columnists for adding to the bonfire, neglecting to mention that The Times rejected impeachment as the punishment. As for Lewinsky, he never touches on how unfairly the press trashed her or on the alleged campaign by the Clinton aide Sidney Blumenthal to besmirch her.","""Bill Clinton,"" by Michael Tomasky, is a brief biography of the 42nd president.",1b243dcc-d49c-5c01-9fc9-da4842c079f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/22/books/review/22KELLY/22KELLY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fe09866392b60f623ad65495b703317cf0aee8d3a0feef0755f1726283d86aff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Bill Clinton in October 1995.,1b243dcc-d49c-5c01-9fc9-da4842c079f6,N24News/imgs/1b243dcc-d49c-5c01-9fc9-da4842c079f6.jpg,13
Real Estate,Choosing Jersey Over the City,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/realestate/choosing-jersey-over-new-york-city.html,"College friends Lina Dorkhman and Olivia Zhang spent the first few years after graduating from New York University living at home, saving for what they assumed would be an eventual move back to the city. But after starting their apartment hunt from their respective New Jersey perches -- Ms. Dorkhman was living at her parents' house in Old Bridge, in Middlesex County, and Ms. Zhang was staying with family friends in the Newport neighborhood of Jersey City -- the women decided that, in fact, they would rather be in Jersey. Ms. Dorkhman and Ms. Zhang, both 25, reached that conclusion one afternoon in the fall of 2016, after touring their fifteenth Jersey City apartment of the day. It was a two-bedroom walk-up, on a corner Grove Street lot, and it was flooded with light. The apartment was both bigger and cheaper -- $2,550 a month -- than another place they had been seriously considering a few blocks away, and it was no-fee. The exposed brick in the kitchen, the spacious living room, the in-building washer and dryer, and the recent renovation were all strong points in the apartment's favor. And then they saw the bathroom.

The women, who moved in last January, said there hasn't been one -- besides a few pretentious college friends who were surprised that they would choose to live in New Jersey for reasons other than financial necessity. ""People crap on it all the time, but I love New Jersey,"" said Ms. Dorkhman, who, truth be told, had been leaning toward her home state the entire time. She keeps a map of Cape May on her bedroom wall and two paintings by a local Jersey artist, Steve Cote, hanging above the couch. Even their dish dryer, a gift from her mother, is shaped like New Jersey. ""I think Lina's love of New Jersey has influenced me as well,"" said Ms. Zhang, who grew up in Shanghai, Washington, D.C., and Southern California.

Having lived in Manhattan during college, neither had a strong desire to return. ""I knew that I'd be able to find a place in my price range, but I also knew the kind of places you can get for that,"" said Ms. Zhang, who lived in a two-bedroom share in Yorkville during her last two years of college, paying $1,300 a month. ""I'd rather have more space. I don't remember anyone ever really having a living room in the city."" As for Ms. Dorkhman, her last Manhattan apartment was a windowless closet in an East Village share for which she paid $1,250 a month. Brooklyn was more appealing, but they soon discovered that the apartments they could afford there weren't close to transportation or, more crucially, to neighborhood amenities like stores and restaurants. ""In Bed-Stuy we saw a couple nice buildings, but in our budget we were looking on the outskirts,"" Ms. Zhang said. ""It's not like here, where you walk downstairs and there's a coffee shop and grocery store.""

Their location in downtown Jersey City, by contrast, is prime. The PATH train station is just a four-minute walk away; also nearby is a park with a farmers' market on Sundays and 99 Ranch Market, a Chinese grocery where Ms. Zhang often shops. Razza, the pizza shop on their block, has been attracting hordes from across the Hudson ever since The New York Times's restaurant critic, Pete Wells, claimed in a September review that the best pizza in New York was in New Jersey. ""I like that it feels like a community here,"" Ms. Dorkhman said. ""There are parades, fall festivals, kids walking around in Halloween costumes. Sometimes I walk down the street and it feels like I'm in 'Beauty and the Beast': 'Bonjour, Bonjour.'""","After saving to move back to New York City, two recent graduates decide they'd rather live in Jersey City.",29c12c23-abd7-599c-99c6-08f289038591,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/03/realestate/03renters3/03renters3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4a69c339ff85db83253537102ca50ab19c35615303dec31b97a6a4672ec90575&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"After graduating from New York University, Lina Dorkhman and Olivia Zhang moved home so they could save enough to return to the city.

Television,'A Suitable Boy' Finally Finds Its Perfect Match: Mira Nair,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/arts/television/suitable-boy-mira-nair.html,"When ""A Suitable Boy"" was published in 1993, the 1,349-page tome about post-Independence India, written by Vikram Seth, became one of the longest English-language novels in print. Superlative reviews around the world ensured its place in the door-stopping canon of modern literary classics. For many devoted readers, the book, set in the 1950s and featuring multiple interreligious friendships and relationships, has endured because of its myriad relatable family dramas and also for being a kind of guide to what it means to be a secular, independent citizen. Now, after several stalled attempts, the beloved novel has been adapted into a lavish new six-part series, directed by the Oscar-nominated filmmaker Mira Nair (""Salaam Bombay!,"" ""Monsoon Wedding""). When it debuted on BBC One in July, it was lauded in Britain as the network's first prime-time drama filmed on location in India with an almost entirely Indian cast. In India, the reaction was more complicated: Members of the ruling Hindu nationalist party have called for a boycott over its depictions of interfaith romance, and the police opened an investigation into Netflix, which distributes the show there. In the United States, where ""A Suitable Boy"" debuted Monday on the streaming service Acorn TV, the series arrives a bit more quietly, but boycott-free.

""The main reason I wanted to do it was to make a mirror to the world that we were farther and farther away from,"" Nair said in a recent video call from her home. ""The '50s has always been a real pull for me -- 1951 was the year my parents got married,"" she added. ""It was a secular time and a time of real idealism, taking from the English what we had known, but making it our own."" The novel ""A Suitable Boy"" emerged as Hindu nationalist politics began to take center stage in India following violent clashes over the destruction, in 1992, of a 16th-century mosque in Ayodhya. Seth set the novel in the aftermath of the violent 1947 division of India by the British along religious lines, which created Pakistan. But his approach was to pen a dramatic comedy of manners, spinning a prickly mother's attempts at Indian matchmaking into a sprawling and heartfelt saga of four upper-class families, star-crossed lovers, religious coexistence and post-Partition politics. It became the definitive novelization of India's founding years.

After several failed attempts to have the book adapted, Seth personally chose the Welsh screenwriter Andrew Davies for the job, fresh off a successful 2016 BBC adaptation of another historical epic, Tolstoy's ""War and Peace."" As Seth continued to work on his long-gestating sequel to the novel, he entrusted his sister, Aradhana Seth, to ensure the integrity of the adaptation. (She is credited as both a producer and an executive producer.) The BBC commissioned the series in 2017; Nair, who had expressed interest from the beginning, was brought on the next year. Humorous comparisons aside, the ""Suitable"" adaptation, though similar in both soapiness and sweep to ""The Crown,"" had nothing like the budget devoted to the House of Windsor drama, one of the most expensive shows on TV. In order to afford the locations and period detail both Nair and Vikram Seth wanted, the production was trimmed from eight episodes to six and condensed the book's serpentine narrative. ""Every time you see something that's being adapted, you have to go in with fresh eyes and leave the book outside the viewing room,"" Aradhana Seth said.

Rather than spread the attention among the novel's many central characters, the TV version focuses primarily on two young protagonists, Lata and Maan (Tanya Maniktala and Ishaan Khatter), who are coming into adulthood as India prepares for its first post-independence elections, held in 1952. While Maan aids in his father's election campaign in the countryside, opening his eyes to the wider politics of caste and religion, Lata learns what it means to find her own way despite her mother's comedic insistence on finding her a suitable Hindu boy. ""There is so much energy to Lata,"" Maniktala said. ""She's fresh out of her university; she's yet to explore the world. She lives in a bubble where, according to her, everything will be great.""

Filming was completed in India last December and Nair took a break in March from editing the show in London with a visit home to New York. Then international borders closed because of the coronavirus. In the video interview, Nair demonstrated how she toggled between multiple screens to edit with her team across the world. Even the music was scored remotely, with a full orchestra in Budapest and her composers, Alex Heffes and the sitarist Anoushka Shankar, in Los Angeles and London. When the show premiered in Britain, it was widely praised in the mainstream press as a milestone in representation on the BBC. South Asian critics were less kind, focusing on the mannered English dialogue and overly enunciated accents, with particular focus on why an 84-year-old Welsh writer had adapted this iconic story about the birth of modern India and a young woman's romantic awakening. As social media criticism built, Vikram Seth broke his public silence to defend his choice of Davies, saying ""race should have nothing to do with it"" in The Telegraph. ""It's a balance between getting someone very, very Indian to write it or someone very, very experienced at adapting long books,"" Davies explained from his home in the British Midlands. (His other TV adaptations include ""Bleak House"" and ""Pride and Prejudice."") ""I feel a little prickly and needing to defend my territory and not have it taken away from me as a writer. I would claim the right to put myself in the mind of people who are different from me."" Nair, who was raised in a secular Hindu family, pushed to return more of the novel's political themes back into the screenplay. ""Politics was front and center for me, and that was one of the biggest things that I could do was to re-shift the balance of the story,"" she said. ""Less from 'will she or won't she marry' -- 'Pride and Prejudice' and Mrs. Bennet, that trope -- to really making Lata feel like the making of India.""

Nair also set out to integrate as much spoken Hindi and Urdu into the screenplay as allowable within the strictures of BBC broadcasting. Asked about balancing the twin demands of her unapologetic brown gaze and prestige British television, she laughed. ""It was a charming tussle, can I say."" It's a familiar challenge for Nair. A seasoned veteran of the sometimes bruising battles for more truthful and artful representations of South Asians on Western screens, she has made several acclaimed films about India and its diaspora. ""She tends to pick topics that reflect ongoing social issues grounded in everyday realities,"" said Amardeep Singh, a professor of English at Lehigh University, in Pennsylvania, who wrote the book ""The Films of Mira Nair: Diaspora Verite."" ""With her attempt to take on the changes occurring in modern India, 'A Suitable Boy' fits very nicely into an arc that includes films like 'Monsoon Wedding' and 'Salaam Bombay!'."" The series was filmed on location amid the ""grandeur and the decay"" of real cities, as Nair described it, where production designers labored to hide the electrified chaos of modern life to achieve the show's layered, midcentury Indian minimalism. An appropriated mansion in Lucknow, in northern India, was refashioned into the salon of a Muslim singer and courtesan named Saeeda Bai. Her home is the luminescent force at the center of Nair's adaptation, the embodiment of an aristocratic Islamic court culture and literary sensuality that was in decline by the time the story begins.

Maniktala teared up over the phone as she reflected on her own grandfather's trauma as a Hindu refugee forced by the 1947 partition to flee to India from what is today Pakistan. ""I realize how important pain is, and the lessons"" to be found in that, she said. ""The kind of empathy people had -- I feel the humanity aspect has been on the decline,"" she continued. ""We have to remember where we came from. We can never forget.""","The filmmaker's acclaimed and controversial adaptation of the landmark novel, the BBC's first prime-time drama with an almost entirely Indian cast, comes to American TV this week.",c4854afe-b12a-54aa-9748-38300fa61f76,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/arts/06SUITABLE3/06SUITABLE3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,"""Mira is very particular about how her women are shown onscreen,"" said the actress Tabu (pictured with Ishaan Khatter) of Mira Nair, the director of ""A Suitable Boy"" on Acorn TV.",c4854afe-b12a-54aa-9748-38300fa61f76,N24News/imgs/c4854afe-b12a-54aa-9748-38300fa61f76.jpg,3
Books,From Children's Books to Live Theater: Mo Willems and Oliver Jeffers Have New Tales to Tell,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/14/books/review/mo-willems-oliver-jeffers-childrens-books-plays.html,"From Children's Books to Live Theater: Mo Willems and Oliver Jeffers Have New Tales to Tell

Mo Willems and Oliver Jeffers -- two of the most beloved, and singular, creators of children's picture books working today -- have both seen their literary creations head to the stage. The musical ""Elephant & Piggie's We Are in a Play!,"" based on Willems's Elephant & Piggie series, recently finished a run at the New Victory Theater in New York and is setting out on a national tour; ""The Way Back Home,"" a puppet production based on Jeffers's book of the same title, will be at the New Victory from March 10 through March 26. The two authors talked to Maria Russo, The Times's children's books editor, about the thrills and embarrassments of children's theater and their books' very different journeys to the stage. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Mo, you were very involved in the play, writing the script and participating all along. Oliver, you didn't even see this production based on your book until it was a done deal. Can you each talk about those different approaches? MO WILLEMS This show grew out of a healthy relationship with the Kennedy Center. They'd already done ""Knuffle Bunny: A Cautionary Musical,"" based on my books, and that experience was really, really great. We've got another in the works too. Now I hope to be doing a play every couple of years, because it's the opposite of books. Books are really not collaborative, but with theater you get all these actors, they bring something to the table, you can steal it and pretend like it's yours -- it's really fun! OLIVER JEFFERS I don't feel like I know very much about theater. Mo, you've been on the stage a little bit. Some of the adaptations of my books that have been on film -- short films -- I've been much more involved with, because I feel comfortable in that arena. Acting is never something I have ever aspired to do. I've got a lot of friends who are talented actors, so I really know I personally am not one. But it's interesting; my work takes shape in many different forms -- filmmaking, sculpture, whatever. And the live theater stage never occurred to me until I saw this piece and could see the potential, the inner beauty of what you could do there. It's a different thing, so different from the book.

WILLEMS: It's temporary. It completely disappears; it vaporizes at the end of each performance. Each one is this great dialogue with a particular group of kids. JEFFERS: And it's different every time. WILLEMS: This play, ""Elephant & Piggie,"" is basically Ionesco -- the kids are just not old enough to realize they should be intimidated by that. You're writing a piece that should be performed and performed well, but it also should be able to be scaled down . . . even in terms of ability. The songs have to be just singable. The set and design have to be able to travel. JEFFERS: Did you write the music? WILLEMS: I wrote the lyrics, but I worked with a composer. We came up with a list of songs I liked and genres, and I hummed into a tape player. That melody was taken away immediately -- it was horrible -- but they got a sense of the core emotion I was trying to get across. At the point at which you can't remember who contributed what to the song, that's when it's done. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

WILLEMS: Oliver's books probably have more words than mine do, so that's interesting. You know, children's theater and picture books are in many ways going for the same thing, so it's a shame children's theater doesn't have a better reputation. When you say, ""I write children's books,"" people say, ""OOOOHH!"" When you say, ""I write children's theater,"" they say, ""Uuuuhhh. . . ."" Because, you know, they're worried there will be balloons involved. Mr. Jeffers, left, and Mr. Willems speaking inside the New Victory Theater. JEFFERS: Would you say it's more accessible, easier to put on a production than it is to, say, self-publish a book? Maybe that contributes to the reputation of children's theater. The range of quality can be much greater. WILLEMS: I also think there's some really great-quality children's theater and people don't quite realize it, in the way that 20 years ago they didn't realize it with picture books. JEFFERS: Especially in the fine art world -- when I was fresh out of college, if you ever mentioned you were doing picture books -- no. WILLEMS: Or it was like, Well you gotta pay the bills! It's better than working as a waiter. JEFFERS: But that's totally changed. And maybe in 20 years it will be the same for children's theater. If there's one thing theater has that books do not, it's the ability to control time. We have no say about how long someone spends on a page, but with theater, you can hold someone in a moment as long as you choose to. You can make it slow or fast. WILLEMS: True. Also interesting about theater: In this show, there's a scene in which Elephant Gerald is deciding whether he should share the ice cream or not. And I've been told that when the school groups come, the kids yell: ""NOOOO! Are you kidding?"" But then when they come with their grandparents, they say, ""Yes, share the ice cream!"" Because the kids also know who they're performing to! JEFFERS: And you know, it hasn't occurred to them that they can leave the theater yet. That they can walk out.

In the ""Elephant & Piggie"" play, there's that moment when Gerald and Piggie look out at the audience and realize they're in a play, and it blows the kids' minds. WILLEMS: They've been there at that point 40 minutes -- so it's really a shocking ""I"" moment. You discover two-thirds of the way through a piece, just like you discover two-thirds through your life, that you have agency! And kids' honesty is really ---- Watching the audience experience ""The Way Back Home"" was interesting too. Since there were no sounds coming from the stage, you could hear the kids in the audience saying, ""What is he doing?"" and ""Is that his bed?"" and just feeling their way through it by talking. JEFFERS: I've been to see it a couple of times, and once there was complete silence, but the other time the kids were much more caught up in talking. It was two totally random audiences. I think once the verbal engagement begins, it's a seal of approval for all the other kids. It sort of spreads and grows, the collective personality of an audience. And it does change the nature of the play. A friend of mine who's an actor says a Saturday night audience is different from a Tuesday night audience -- the Saturday night audience expects to be entertained; they're like ""This better be good!"" While Tuesday night they're just happy to be out of the house. WILLEMS: The audience is just a bunch of strangers, but they're communicating as well. It's magic. And what's so great about it is that it's impermanent; you don't have to document it, you just experience it. You can't ever relive it. You can only relive the feeling you had. Does having had these theater versions of your work out in the world inform how you approach making a picture book now? JEFFERS: To me, the process of making a book is not unlike making a film, but the process of theater is just so unlike all that. The lack of control in the collaboration, the blocking for time, the restricted space. . . . I don't think that translates to books. But with film, when the scene changes and when the page changes, the way you're looking at it is similar, whether you're above, up close, beside. . . .

WILLEMS: I come from writing sketch, and I structure my books in a sketch structure. But I would think of the books in terms of animation before a play. What else have you learned from the theater experiences? WILLEMS: Adapting to the stage is always interesting, because you discover things. You have to fill time with what you've written, and you might realize that what you've done in the book may have some meat that you didn't even anticipate. JEFFERS: I think good stories are good stories, and the platform changes. WILLEMS: They're apples and elephants. For me the biggest thing is to go from being mostly solo to being super collaborative. It's nice to stretch different muscles that way. JEFFERS: It comes down to trust and mutual respect. WILLEMS: And time! When I worked in television, there was some money but no time. And in theater, there's no money, but there's time. So you can write the piece and come back to it six months later and workshop it over a week. There's all this time to let things marinate. That's one way theater is more like books than film is. WILLEMS: And that's why I much prefer theater over film or television. Time is an element, you get to be with people you trust and come back in a few months and revisit. JEFFERS: Normally when I'm making a book, I'm in the feeling, and I keep going to the end. Maybe I go back and review what I did. I recently collaborated on a book called ""A Child of Books"" with my friend Sam Winston. We were forced to take pockets of time as we sent the work back and forth, and it changed everything. Do you think you might get more involved in future theater productions of your books, Oliver?

Real Estate,"A Family of Four, Then Five, Now Six",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/02/realestate/a-family-of-four-then-five-now-six.html,"A Family of Four, Then Five, Now Six

Back when Vanessa Hylande and Jesse Peckham lived in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, rents there were rising steeply, so they decided they might as well move to Manhattan. They rented a two-bedroom two-bath apartment in the Archstone on West End Avenue at 64th Street. Their sons, Emmett, now 10, and Elliot, now 6, shared the master bedroom, ""because we wanted the toys out of the living room,"" Ms. Hylande said. By the time their third son, Julian, now 2, arrived, they were facing a big rent increase. (Two-bedrooms in the Archstone now start at $5,400 a month.) So they moved farther uptown to one of the few postwar high-rises in the West 80s. They paid around $3,000 for a two-bedroom with one bathroom.

Mr. Peckham called the situation ""a serious downgrade,"" though they lived on a high floor with great views. Sirens often screamed up Amsterdam Avenue, Ms. Hylande said, and ""I was getting really sick of carrying enormous bags of laundry down to the laundry room, even though it was in the building."" After a year there, with a fourth child on the way, the family went on the hunt for more space. They thought they could afford a three-bedroom rental somewhere in Upper Manhattan, where the A train would take them straight to SoHo, where the couple direct an a cappella singing group called Khorikos. Mr. Peckham is its founder and conductor. The two first met when Ms. Hylande, a singer and a dancer, auditioned. She is now the chief executive of the group, and he is an executive in the dairy industry. Upper Manhattan was also an easy ride to the kids' school and to the Lincoln Center area, where the boys take violin lessons and where Emmett sings in the Metropolitan Opera Children's Chorus.

""We really love that area,"" Ms. Hylande said. ""We just can't afford to move there."" The couple sought a rent in the mid-$2,000 range. A three-bedroom would do, as would a two-bedroom convertible to three. ""We needed the separate room so the older kids could close the door and not have the little one scribbling all over their homework,"" Ms. Hylande said. They hoped for a location near a park so the boys could play outside, and longed for a second bathroom. But rents, even far uptown, weren't as low as they expected. For around $2,400, they found a three-bedroom near the Morris-Jumel Mansion in the West 160s and left a deposit. But the rent was bid up. By that time, their second choice, a three-bedroom in the far West 140s, near Riverbank State Park, was taken. One day, on the way to see an apartment, they took the wrong train and found themselves in Central Harlem. They walked past Jackie Robinson Park, which has play equipment, ball fields and even a swimming pool. They found the neighborhood beautiful, with plenty of new buildings. At the same time, they realized it would be better in the long run to buy a place, so they wouldn't be priced out by unpredictable rents. So, last fall, with interest rates low, the couple decided to look in Central Harlem. Their budget was around $500,000.

Because they had a fourth child on the way, ""I felt so bad they were even considering a two-bedroom two-bath,"" said Charlie Lewis of Warburg Realty, the building's sales manager. ""They were looking at how they could convert the living room into a bedroom, and brought measuring tapes."" Other offers were coming in, Mr. Lewis said. The two-bedroom sold. The couple loved the look of Bradhurst Court nearby, but they didn't quite meet the co-op's income restrictions. They realized, too, that its location on the main thoroughfare, 145th Street, might be noisy.

The Park Lane Condominium on West 112th Street was a small renovated building with prewar charm. But the elevator was too small for a double stroller. Three-bedrooms there were in the $500,000s and $600,000s, while two-bedrooms were listed around $500,000, but those layouts didn't easily allow for the conversion of a third bedroom. The same problem arose at Odell Clark Place, a condominium on West 138th Street -- three-bedrooms were too pricey and two-bedrooms didn't convert well. Back at Ellington on the Park, the couple negotiated for the three-bedroom, and bought it for $580,000. They closed last winter, just before their fourth son, Liam, was born. Now they are glad they decided to buy. ""In almost every way it is better than I thought it would be,"" Mr. Peckham said. ""This is probably the best investment I ever made in my life.""","A growing family moves uptown, then uptown again, settling in Central Harlem.",fc193104-3d6c-560c-abef-215b9ef07a95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/02/realestate/02HUNT5_SPAN/Hunt5-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=45ff47eb0e20a9ba48e65095fe7027ef90feefccfe20c9ea464e1d94e919d290&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Buyers Jesse Peckham and Vanessa Hylande with their children in their new home.,fc193104-3d6c-560c-abef-215b9ef07a95,N24News/imgs/fc193104-3d6c-560c-abef-215b9ef07a95.jpg,7
Real Estate,Shopping for Dining Chairs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/realestate/shopping-for-dining-chairs.html,"With more people spending more time at home these days, dining chairs are getting a workout -- as seating for meals, but also as improvised places to sit while working or home schooling.

In the face of such a multiplicity of demands, durability and comfort are at least as important as style.

""Most people don't change their dining chairs very often, so the durability of the materials and quality of construction are very important,"" said Dolores Suarez, who founded Dekar Design in Manhattan with Caroline Grant. ""It's something people should look forward to using for many years.""

Ms. Suarez and Ms. Grant have researched a number of hard-wearing dining chairs over the years, while designing the interiors of New York restaurants like Claudette, Bobo and Rosemary's, as well as private homes.","With so many of us working at the dining table these days, our chairs need to be multifunctional.

Fashion & Style,"Angelina Jolie to Divorce Brad Pitt, Ending 'Brangelina'",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/fashion/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce.html,"It was a grand Hollywood romance that made its presence felt far and wide, from the red carpet to refugee camps in the world's trouble spots. It was chronicled in lavish photo spreads in high-end fashion magazines and in paparazzi shots that appeared in the tabloids and on the gossip sites, as if to undercut the couple's mythic status. Now, with a lawyer's blandly worded press statement on Tuesday morning, the love story of Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt, who were married in 2014, has come to an unhappy end. ""This decision was made for the health of the family,"" Robert Offer, a lawyer for Ms. Jolie Pitt, said in the statement. ""She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time.""

The announcement came a little over two years after the couple married in a ceremony before roughly 20 friends and family members in a Romanesque chapel on the grounds of Chateau Miraval, their estate in the south of France. The couple's six children, three of them adopted, attended the bride and groom. The master tailor Luigi Massi of Atelier Versace made Ms. Jolie Pitt's wedding dress, incorporating designs from her children's drawings. In keeping with the public nature of their relationship, Mr. Pitt and Ms. Jolie Pitt sold the photographs of their wedding day to People and Hello! magazines for a reported $5 million. In keeping with their habit of giving to charity, the couple contributed the payment to the Jolie-Pitt Foundation. When their romance became public, the tabloids were quick to dub them ""Brangelina."" At the time, she was a divorced mother of an adopted son, Maddox, having ended her marriage to the actor Billy Bob Thornton in 2003. Mr. Pitt was still married to the ""Friends"" star Jennifer Aniston.

Their most recent project as a couple, the 2015 film ""By the Sea,"" directed by Ms. Jolie Pitt, told a different story. ""Meta with a vengeance, 'By the Sea' stars Angelina Jolie Pitt and Brad Pitt as itinerant married artists who are suffering, beautifully, through a rough patch,"" Manohla Dargis wrote in her review for The New York Times. Asked about the process of directing her husband, Ms. Jolie Pitt told Vanity Fair, ""A few friends asked if we were crazy."" The moody film was a box-office flop, grossing $3.3 million. During the course of their relationship, the Jolie Pitt clan expanded. In addition to Maddox, 15, whom she adopted in Cambodia in 2002, the couple are parents to Zahara, 11, from Ethiopia; Shiloh, to whom she gave birth in Namibia in 2006; Pax, 12, adopted in Vietnam; and the twins Vivienne and Knox, 8, to whom Ms. Jolie Pitt gave birth in 2008. Ms. Jolie Pitt and Mr. Pitt have separately discussed struggling with self-destructive behavior in their younger years. Both seemed to have overcome the dark periods, with a slew of high grossing, critically acclaimed films to their names and a well-documented commitment to philanthropy. She began working for the United Nations in 2000 as a good-will ambassador, and became the special envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 2012. She has gone on dozens of missions to countries around the world, including Iraq, Jordan and Myanmar. Last year she addressed the United Nations Security Council, arguing that the United Nations was failing the people of Syria. Earlier this month, Ms. Jolie Pitt spent three days at the Azraq camp in Jordan, which is home to more than 37,000 Syrian refugees, according to the United Nations.

During her years with Mr. Pitt, she had box office hits with the action movie ""Wanted"" and the Disney fantasy ""Maleficent"" while also making a name for herself as a director of serious fare like ""In the Land of Blood and Honey,"" a love story set against the backdrop of the Bosnian War, and ""Unbroken."" He has won an Oscar for producing the critically acclaimed ""12 Years a Slave"" and has been nominated for several other Oscars, including for best actor for ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"" and for ""Moneyball."" He was also nominated for a best supporting actor Golden Globe for his role in ""Babel."" In 2013, Ms. Jolie Pitt wrote a candid and widely praised Op-Ed page essay for The New York Times about choosing to have a preventive double mastectomy. She followed it up in 2015 with an essay on her next preventive surgery, during which her ovaries and fallopian tubes were removed. While he wears his political commitments more lightly than Ms. Jolie Pitt, Mr. Pitt is a founder of Not on Our Watch, a nongovernmental organization devoted to preventing genocide, and the founder of Make It Right, which builds homes and other structures for people in need.

Over the course of their time together, the couple demonstrated an unusual ability to negotiate with the media. After Shiloh was born in 2006, the couple sold photos of the mother and newborn to People magazine for an estimated $4.1 million, all of which they donated to charity. That same year they negotiated with People on another deal, giving the magazine exclusive photos of Ms. Jolie and Maddox for an estimated $750,000 and the promise to cover Ms. Jolie Pitt's charity work.","Ms. Jolie Pitt and Mr. Pitt created a mythic version of themselves for public consumption.

Well,Enduring Lessons From My Mom,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/08/well/family/Mothers-Day-lessons.html,"Debra Weiner is interviewing 100 newsmakers, thought leaders and other people who've made an outsize difference about the most valuable thing their parents taught them. Following are excerpts from a few of those stories, edited and condensed. Creating Something Out of Nothing An interdisciplinary artist whose work is in the collections of MoMA, the Smithsonian, the de Young Museum, among numerous other major art institutions.

My mother once told me how she came home from work one day and the only food we had in the house was popcorn. I'm sure she was thinking, ""OK, what am I going to do? How do I camouflage this from my children? I've got to come up with a plan."" So she said, ""Oh my God, we're going to have a party! And we're going to make popcorn! And we get to watch a movie!"" We got all excited and crazy and didn't think twice about not having enough food. Yes, I could open the refridge and see nothing in there. But for some reason, it just wasn't registering, I think because she'd come up with this celebratory party around popcorn and had created something extraordinary. It applies to everything. Growing up, I would make my mother stuff 24/7 -- things like halter tops and macrame accessories back in the day, all of which she wore proudly, or just something simple like a card. But whatever it was, my mother never said, ""Thank you sweetie. It's cute. I like it. Love you."" Her response was always so exaggerated, so enormous in terms of intensity that it made me feel like it was the most extraordinary thing she'd ever had in her life.

And that's what she gave me -- this sort of knowledge, this kind of magic to create something out of nothing by restructuring, redesigning, reimagining what can happen in a moment and then walking into it. It's really about making the moment matter and how you bring clarity to whatever that is, good or bad. If you're down, honey, be down in the moment. Get a clear handle on it and step into it. It's all part of the world. You just have to walk into it. And oh my God, the liberty around that is phenomenal, because it's endless. Author of the novel ""Call Your Daughter Home"" and an award-winning television producer.

My mother is a recovering alcoholic, and I think it's important to note that she was 16, a sophomore in high school, when she got pregnant with me. My father was 19. They ran away to Tennessee to get married because nobody in Kentucky would marry them. They lasted about 12 years. When they first split up, my mother wasn't making any money and she was a mess. We were on food stamps. She would disguise herself, wear a wig and scarf and glasses, and go downtown to shop for groceries because she didn't want anyone to know. And she really started drinking a lot. It wasn't every day, but you never knew when it was going to happen. She would call to say, ""I've only had a couple drinks. I'll be home soon."" And soon would mean 3 or 4 or 5 in the morning. I don't know how bad it got for her because I didn't want to know, but there were blackouts and a car accident that she didn't remember. It was a Saturday morning and she woke me up. She was hung over and crying and I remember going outside, walking around the car and seeing the whole front end bashed in, but I didn't see any blood. And there was a suicide attempt when I was 14. I didn't understand why anybody who had two kids would do something like that. So it was a dark time. Later, once I joined Al-Anon, when my son was born, I realized alcoholism is a disease and she just didn't have any control over it. But in spite of the difficulties growing up with an alcoholic parent, in spite of the difficulties of having really young parents, the thing I learned from my mother was the courage to change. She ended up getting her high school diploma, she quit drinking, quit smoking, and became an incredibly successful real estate agent in Kentucky. And that was a real gift to me, because seeing her forge her way through life, I knew I could forge my way. I thought, if she can change her life, I can change mine if I really, really want to.

After I had my daughter, I stepped away from the entertainment business for a year and went to work as a grief counselor at the Grief Recovery Institute. And what you learn in this program is that even if you've been victimized beyond your wildest imagination, hanging on to that victimization is your responsibility. It's something you can change. Once I was able to shift and look for whatever I could to take care of on my side of the street, my whole life -- my marriage, my finances, everything -- changed. I thought, if my mother had the courage to quit what had wreaked so much havoc in her life and ours and reinvent herself, I could certainly have the courage to leave an unhappy work situation and do something I've always wanted to do. And it's happening. A few years ago, I wrote a novella that led to a full novel, which was published in June. I mean, change is inevitable for all of us, but looking at your patterns of behavior and choosing to do something about them takes a lot of honesty, which is scary. Seeing something that's not good and leaving it behind, in the hope you can make something better, I think that's courage. Stepping out in faith, for me it's critical. A featured dancer with the Joffrey Ballet who began her professional ballet career at age 17, and counted Rudolf Nureyev among her partners.

My mother was a waitress in some Italian restaurant and my father was a trumpet player in a band -- a pit -- in a burlesque house in Miami. We were probably really poor. We had a very tiny house; they were just scraping. But my mother wanted something special, something big for me and my sister, and a couple of dollars every week went into the pot to help the kids do X. In my world, they decided it was going to be dance. I started out at 6 in one of these tap-jazz-acrobatic-ballet classes that taught you not much of anything but everything in an hour once a week. The other six days, I would practice every afternoon for half an hour. So right away I learned about discipline. It was huge in our house. I always called it ""the big D."" Before you do your homework, as soon as you come home, put on your tap shoes and tap in the little six-foot kitchen, back and forth. ""OK, again,"" my mother would say. ""Again. OK, repeat.""

Later, it became practice in the carport. My dad brought out a piece of plywood and attached a little barre to the house so that I could practice my ballet. Again it was first you practice, then homework, then if there's time you can play a little. It was fine with me. I really loved it. My sister was killed in a car accident when she was 18. She had just entered into the University of Miami and was a beauty queen, a soloist baton twirler, and had this television program, a live talk show, that she did on Saturdays. Life ended up falling apart for my mother and she was never the same. She was terrified the same thing would happen to me. I was 10, and from that point on ""the big D"" became even more important. Everything came onto my shoulders. I had to make it. It was like, ""Whew, this thing better work because they don't have my sister any more."" It wasn't some tragic play where it never happened. I danced on stages in great opera houses around the world. It was big. It was wonderful. But only when I deserved it did I get it. My last five years of dance, I was saving every penny. I wasn't like some scrounge that ran around without proper clothing, but you can't dance forever, and I always wanted to go to college. At 38, I went to N.Y.U. and on to Columbia for a master's degree. So ""the big D"" came through in that area, too. If you don't have discipline, you can easily fall apart or sort of chuck it and not try for it. But if you don't do it today, it might not be there tomorrow. I mean, it can be a wonderful life, but things happen and sometimes life gets cut short. So if something comes across your little plate, you got to grab that cookie.","For Mother's Day, high achievers reflect on what they most appreciate learning from their mothers: the magic of creation, self-discipline and the courage to change.",79db082b-a388-5408-bc2d-f153c84bd218,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/08/well/08well-spera/08well-spera-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=389&w=744&s=515e98075bc7c4115bbca2deaa23a0da409d0e501c738e9d7bdf980c19e186c2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Deb Spera as a child with, from left, her mother, Patricia Jo Murren Passmore; her great-grandmother, Gertrude Lillian Lane; and her grandmother, Edna Alma Lane.",79db082b-a388-5408-bc2d-f153c84bd218,N24News/imgs/79db082b-a388-5408-bc2d-f153c84bd218.jpg,18
Your Money,"Options for Self-Publishing Proliferate, Easing the Bar to Entry",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/30/your-money/the-rise-in-self-publishing-opens-the-door-for-aspiring-writers.html,"I'M a snob. Oh, I don't particularly care what kind of car you drive or if you wear the latest designer fashions, but until recently I turned up my nose at authors who published their own books. It smacked of self-indulgence and vanity (as in that old term ""vanity press""). But as one friend and then another chose to pay to publish their own books -- people I admire and respect -- and as the author Amanda Hocking became the superstar example of successful self-publishing, I realized I had been too hasty. The phenomenon was worth a second look. And one of the first things I learned about the self-publishing business was that there was a reason the subject of many self-published books was -- yes -- how to self-publish, because it's not easy to understand all the ins and outs. ""As with many things in life, there are often hidden fees,"" said Lorraine Shanley, president of Market Partners International, a publishing consulting firm.

And many options. First, you can choose to publish your book as a print edition, e-book or both. With print editions, the most common system now is called ""print on demand."" That means you don't actually have the book printed until someone buys it. That's unlike the old days, say 15 years ago, when if you published your own book, you had to commit to buying hundreds or thousands of copies. The advent of digital printing means it makes economic sense to print one copy at a time, said Kevin Weiss, president and chief executive of Author Solutions, which owns numerous self-publishing companies, including iUniverse, AuthorHouse and Xlibris. ""Before, you had to fill your garage with books and pass them on to all your best friends,"" Mr. Weiss said. Self-publishing is obviously taking off, but statistics on new titles are almost impossible to come by because so many books counted as part of ""nontraditional"" publishing include reprints of old books now in the public domain.

But Mr. Weiss said his company was on track to publish 26,000 new books this year, compared with 13,000 four years ago. CreateSpace, the self-publishing arm of Amazon.com, doesn't release numbers, but a spokeswoman, Brittany Turner, told me in an e-mail that its books increased by 80 percent from 2009 to 2010. There are many reasons potential authors want to publish their own books, Mr. Weiss said. They have an idea or manuscript they have passed around to various agents and publishers with no luck; they may just want to print a few copies of, say, a memoir for family members; they want to use it in their business as a type of calling card; or they actually want to sell a lot of books and make their living as writers. ""You have to know what services you're buying, who retains the rights, and realize that getting a book published is not the same as getting it marketed,"" Ms. Shanley said. ""One size doesn't fit all."" Then there's choosing the right company. If you're technologically comfortable, Lulu.com or CreateSpace may be good options. CreateSpace, for example, doesn't charge upfront fees, but you'll pay if you want additional services like copy editing and design layout. And it costs $5 to $10 for the printed proof. On the other hand, iUniverse and AuthorHouse offer what Mr. Weiss called ""assisted self-publishing."" But the price of that assistance can range widely, starting as low as $400 and going as high as $15,000. For the lower end, you get help in creating a cover and getting a copyright and ISBN number (the numeric book identifier). You'll also get one paperback copy of your finished book, as well as an e-book distributed on all platforms, including the Kindle and the Nook. The book will also be sold through Amazon and Barnes & Noble. For $15,000, you get content editing and copy editing, indexing, citations and footnoting, and promotions like book trailers, placement in Google searches and other goodies. And you receive 150 paperback and 50 hardback copies of your book.

Like many authors, Susan G. Bell, who lives in Larchmont, N.Y., had mixed experiences publishing her own book. A former managing director at J. P. Morgan Securities who went back to school to get her master of fine arts at Sarah Lawrence College, she told me she had submitted her Wall Street novel, ""When the Getting Was Good,"" to about 20 agents. Despite receiving some positive feedback, there were no bites. A few years ago, after hearing that a Sarah Lawrence classmate had self-published a memoir, she decided to check out that route. ""I just wanted to get on with it,"" Ms. Bell said. ""I was ready."" Following her classmate's lead, she chose AuthorHouse and bought one of the lower-cost packages. It took about a year from the decision to self-publish to the day she held a copy of the book in her hand. She spent some time learning the ropes: setting up a Web site, figuring out social media, getting blurbs for the book, arranging for an author photo and finding someone to design the cover. For the cover design, she chose several she liked from novels she had read and contacted the designer of one of them through the designer's Web site. To her surprise, she was able to commission one for $2,000. Ms. Bell is not sorry she went the self-publishing route, but like so many authors (and yes, even those who are traditionally published) she found book promotion much tougher than she thought it would be. ""What I didn't realize was how difficult it would be to get a review for a self-published book,"" she said. ""And it's hard to sell books without reviews.""

Nonetheless, Ms. Bell has sold about 700 books through the first quarter of this year, and that is better than most: industry experts say the average self-published book sells fewer -- often far fewer -- than 150 copies. And after all this, can you make money by self-publishing? How much you receive per book varies widely depending on who publishes it and who sells it. For print books, the royalty can run as little as $1 to $3 a book, although you can get much more if you sell from your own Web site or if you publish it as an e-book. For e-books that sell for $2.99 to $9.99 on Kindle, for example, authors can earn a 70 percent royalty, and eBooks priced outside that range earn authors a 35 percent royalty, according to Ms. Turner, the Amazon spokeswoman. Potential authors have to be realistic about what they can expect when self-publishing, Ms. Shanley said. But that should not necessarily deter them from doing it. ""With all the caveats, it's really liberating and a field-leveling advance,"" she said. ""That might not be the attitude of many publishers, but for consumers it is."" After all, in the past, Ms. Bell would have just had to tuck her manuscript away in a drawer. ""I wanted to cross the finish line,"" she said. ""I'm holding a book, and I'm proud of it."" And that's important. But so is knowing the drawbacks.

Economy,Final 3rd-Quarter Estimate Shows U.S. Economy Growing 2%,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q3-final.html,"The government revised its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter down slightly on Tuesday, as consumer spending helped sustain a modest growth rate despite a dip in net exports caused in part by the stronger dollar. ""The Achilles heels of the second half of 2015 are inventories and trade, which remain a drag on growth,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ""The good news is that consumers are showing a willingness to carry the economy into the new year."" At an annualized rate of 2 percent, the pace of expansion in the third quarter was not far out of line with the slow but steady gains registered since the recovery began in mid-2009. Last year, the United States economy -- as measured by changes in gross domestic product adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation -- grew by 2.4 percent. In 2013, it expanded at a 1.5 percent rate.

Businesses have been cautious about spending, while plunging oil prices have prompted energy companies to cut back on new investments. A weaker trade balance also exerted pressure, reducing growth by 0.3 percentage point. In a separate report on Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell by 10.5 percent in November, an unexpected plunge that the group and private economists attributed to the start of new government rules that may have slowed down mortgage closings. ""We expect delayed sales activity to be recouped in coming months as the real estate industry adjusts to these new regulations,"" Barclays said in a note to clients on Tuesday. For all the blows the economy has absorbed in recent years, it has maintained a remarkably even keel.

Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, said he was struck by a seemingly obscure but telling data point in the third quarter report: a 2.9 percent increase in final sales to domestic purchasers, which strips out the negative impact of inventory changes and net exports. ""That's a very respectable top line figure,"" he said. ""The economy's underlying growth rate is more in the neighborhood of 3 percent than 2 percent.""
* Elizabeth Holmes Hones Her Defense in Day 2 of Testimony
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. Economists expect the growth rate in the current fourth quarter to be similar to that of the third quarter, with the economy's rate of expansion for 2015 expected to be just over 2 percent. One major source of weakness recently has been the strong dollar, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. The dollar's rise hurts American companies by making American exports more expensive for overseas buyers. At the same time, the picture for growth in both Asia and Europe remains cloudy. ""Employment has been holding up but the big economic story has been downward pressure from a strong dollar,"" Mr. Slok said. ""And the rest of the world, unfortunately, is still weak.""

Indeed, last week's interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which came as some other central banks overseas were maintaining more accommodative monetary policies, could push the dollar even higher. ""The negative effect from inventories is temporary,"" Mr. Behravesh said, ""but weak exports will be part of the U.S. picture for at least another year or two."" Tuesday's revision is the last of three estimates by the Commerce Department of economic growth in July, August and September. The downward adjustment had been expected, with economists predicting before the report that growth would be revised down to 1.9 percent. The first estimate, in October, showed growth of 1.5 percent. That was revised upward to 2.1 percent last month. A fresher take on the economy's prospects will come on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reports data for consumer spending and income in November. Economists are forecasting a pickup in spending, with incomes growing more modestly.","Economic growth was revised down slightly to 2 percent, from 2.1 percent, the government said in its revision of the data.",f41e2eab-9678-533e-a603-d7b86806233d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/23/business/23ECON/23ECON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=aba9e9a6a73932434c227389e3a361bcd8ab70b4a6e80bcc040ebdc084a559cd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shopping on Black Friday at a Macy's in Manhattan.

Food,18 Easy Holiday Desserts,https://www.nytimes.com/article/easy-holiday-desserts.html,"Whether you're an experienced baker who makes a Hogwarts sorting hat croquembouche for fun, or a beginner who rarely turns on the oven, sometimes you want something delicious and festive that you can throw together in a snap. These 18 simple recipes are just that, and most of them take less prep time than it takes to watch ""The Grinch."" (The 25-minute 1966 original, of course.)

Technically, this is not a baking recipe, but it's so incredibly good, who cares? This salty-sweet treat, which came to The Times from Kelly Mahoney, a reader in Boulder, Colo., calls for just saltine crackers, sugar, butter, vanilla and chocolate. Some readers like to sprinkle the melted chocolate with crushed candy canes, flaky sea salt or chopped nuts. You can make it with salted matzo in place of the saltines, too.

Nell Lewis of Platte City, Mo., entered the Pillsbury Bake-Off contest with this recipe in 1963. She didn't win, but the recipe has since become an internet favorite for its impossibly tender crumb and sugary crust. This is the only cake recipe on this list that requires an electric mixer, but all you have to do is dump the ingredients into the bowl and beat it like mad for a good three minutes.

This banana bread from Erin Jeanne McDowell is here to use up the four overripe bananas that are languishing on your counter or in the back of your freezer. Make it chocolate-chocolate chip banana bread by substituting some cocoa powder for the flour. (See the tip in the recipe for measurements.) Oh, and thankfully, it requires no mixer.

Melissa Clark's 20-minute no-bake bars are inspired by buckeyes and peanut butter cups, but with an added layer of caramelized flavor that comes from browning the butter before stirring it into the cookie crumb crust. It's also wildly adaptable: Use almond butter instead of peanut butter, add Rice Krispies to the filling or sprinkle the top with flaky sea salt or crushed pretzels.

This shortbread, which came to The Times from Amy Casey, a reader in Sparta, N.J., is so easy it feels a little silly. Melt the butter, add the rest of the ingredients, then stir to combine. Press into a pan, top with plenty of sugar and bake. Some readers like to add a dash of cardamom or citrus zest. Good news: If you don't have rice flour, you can use cornstarch.

Readers went gaga over this one-bowl Depression-era cake from Melissa Clark. For a bit more flair, try adding a handful or two of chocolate chips to the batter, or slicking the top with a simple ganache. (One very helpful reader tip: Check your mayonnaise's ingredients before getting started; some contain dried onion powder, which would not taste great here.)

Melissa Clark's Instagram followers went nuts when she posted a picture of this plain-looking bittersweet-citrus cake on her feed: Campari and olive oil? Sign us up! Use the best olive oil you can as its fragrant notes will complement the astringency of the Campari. This is definitely a more sophisticated, less sweet cake, so if that's not your thing, try using Aperol instead as one Italian reader recommended.

A cheerful lemony cake is a nice break from the spiced and chocolaty desserts of the holiday season. Olive oil and buttermilk make this one from Melissa Clark impossibly tender and rich. For the tangiest results, use conventional lemons (not Meyer, which are milder), and really work the lemon zest into the granulated sugar. If you don't have buttermilk, use  1/4  cup milk plus  1/4  cup sour cream or plain yogurt in its place.

Leftover gingerbread house pieces were the inspiration for this recipe from Melissa Clark, but you can use store-bought gingersnaps instead (or the remains of that gingerbread house kit your kid never finished). Be sure to let them rest for a couple of days before serving.",No-fuss treats for a sweet season.,52dcc3bb-22a3-5755-ac05-0db8f20dade7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/21/dining/21COOKING-LEMONALMONDTART4/21COOKING-LEMONALMONDTART4-facebookJumbo.jpg,Pan-baked lemon almond tart.,52dcc3bb-22a3-5755-ac05-0db8f20dade7,N24News/imgs/52dcc3bb-22a3-5755-ac05-0db8f20dade7.jpg,17
Health,"A University Had a Great Coronavirus Plan, but Students Partied On",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/health/university-illinois-covid.html,"At the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, more than 40,000 students take tests twice a week for the coronavirus. They cannot enter campus buildings unless an app vouches that their test has come back negative. Everyone has to wear masks. This is one of the most comprehensive plans by a major college to keep the virus under control. University scientists developed a quick, inexpensive saliva test. Other researchers put together a detailed computer model that suggested these measures would work, and that in-person instruction could go forward this fall. But the predictive model included an oversight: It assumed that all of the students would do all of the things that they were told to. Enough students continued to go to parties even after testing positive, showing how even the best thought-out plans to keep college education moving can fail when humans do not heed common sense or the commands from public health officials.

Randall Munroe, the creator of the popular internet comic strip XKCD, and a contributor to The Times, poked fun at the fact that two of the people who were key players in developing the models were physicists. ""Can't understand why someone with a physics degree would be bad at judging how often college students get invited to parties,"" comments one of the XKCD characters. Nigel Goldenfeld, one of the physicists who was the butt of the comic strip, replied in good humor. ""We enjoyed the joke,"" he said. But, he noted, it was not a completely accurate portrayal of what happened.

For one, while he and a fellow physicist, Sergei Maslov, had devoted effort to an epidemiological model for all of Illinois, the more detailed university simulation, modeling the movements of some 46,000 students, professors and others like servers in coffee shops and bars who interact with students, was the effort of a larger group and led by Dr. Goldenfeld and Ahmed E. Elbanna, a professor of civil and environmental engineering. (It's harder to make jokes about civil engineers.) Second, they had indeed taken into account college partying and quite a bit of it -- more than 7,000 students partying three times a week in their model.
* The Australian Open will require players to be fully vaccinated.
* A C.D.C. study finds stillbirths are higher in pregnant women with Covid. What the scientists had not taken into account was that some students would continue partying after they received a positive test result. ""It was willful noncompliance by a small group of people,"" Dr. Goldenfeld said. Those were the key ingredients for a few people infecting many others. ""If you know you are positive,"" Dr. Elbanna said, ""and you go to a party, that's not just a bad act. That's very, very dangerous.""

Some of the students who tested positive even tried to circumvent the app so that they could enter buildings instead of staying isolated in their rooms, university administrators said in a letter to students. Comprehensive testing of everyone on campus and prompt contact tracing showed the trouble spots -- some fraternities and sororities, as well as some off-campus housing, that were throwing parties -- as well as where the containment plans were working. There were few signs of the virus spreading in classrooms or from students to the people in the surrounding towns of Champaign and Urbana.

Dr. Goldenfeld said the main purpose of the model was not to make precise predictions, but to help administrators make informed choices on what precautions made sense. For example, the model showed that once-a-week screening, as university administrators originally planned, was too little, too slow. Students who were infected soon after a test cleared them would be infectious for days before the next test. The university increased the mandate to two tests a week, although now that schedule is only for undergraduate students. Since the university clamped down last week, the number of new cases has dropped again, and the hope is that all students will now take the protocols more seriously. Carl T. Bergstrom, a professor of biology at the University of Washington in Seattle and an infectious disease expert, said most of the other large state universities were ""opening and hoping for the best without doing any kind of serious testing or they've switched to largely online education."" What the University of Illinois has tried to do is ""pretty unusual,"" Dr. Bergstrom said. ""Being able to have an in-person semester at a school of that size with that kind of social atmosphere is really a remarkable accomplishment and I think they have a reasonable chance of pulling it off,"" he said. ""If it doesn't work, they gave it a damn good try."" The positivity rate for the tests is currently about 1 percent. ""It's higher than we would like, but it's coming down,"" said Rebecca Lee Smith, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Illinois. ""I am hopeful. Everything is going in the right direction."" Dr. Goldenfeld said the notoriety of recent days even had some upside: The XKCD zinging gave him ""street cred"" with his daughters, he said.",An unexpected upswing in positive tests at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign showed how even the most comprehensive approaches to limiting the virus's spread can break down.,4aa15524-32cc-570a-b90a-743f45918ce9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/15/science/10VIRUS-ILLINOIS1/10VIRUS-ILLINOIS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5734be69dbc9dfac8b201a8dea23e97e46405cb68076dc0ae3cc0d5a19c106ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;It was willful noncompliance by a small group of people,&rdquo; said one university physicist.",4aa15524-32cc-570a-b90a-743f45918ce9,N24News/imgs/4aa15524-32cc-570a-b90a-743f45918ce9.jpg,1
Theater,Review: Reckoning With Medical Betrayals 'Behind the Sheet',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/17/theater/behind-the-sheet-review.html,"Physical pain, relentless and undeniable, throbs like a bass line in ""Behind the Sheet,"" the deeply affecting new historical drama by Charly Evon Simpson at Ensemble Studio Theater. Sometimes it takes the audible, metaphoric form of a hammered drum. And every now and then a scream, quickly muffled, lances the air. But for the most part, agony holds its tongue in this meticulously assembled story of a dark chapter in medical experimentation. Like its core of heroines -- plantation slave women used as gynecological guinea pigs in the South of the 1840s -- ""Behind the Sheet,"" which opened on Thursday night, resists the natural urge to shout in righteous defiance. Instead, as directed with Olympian calm by Colette Robert, the production takes on cumulative power in its steady, cleareyed depiction of a time when it was a given that pain would be borne uncomplainingly by human beings regarded as chattel. That ""some things are just the way they are,"" as one character says, becomes a stoic's creed for survival. What the young black women portrayed here have to survive includes repeated vaginal surgeries -- as many as 30 -- performed without anesthetic. ""Behind the Sheet"" was inspired by the career of J. Marion Sims, an American physician and plantation owner known as ""the father of modern gynecology"" (and a figure whose commemorative statue was recently removed from Central Park, as we're reminded in an onstage postscript).

Sims pioneered an ultimately successful technique for sewing vaginal fistulas, acquired during difficult childbirths, through experimentation on slave women he owned or bought from other plantations. It is a subject that would seem to lend itself to sensationalism and horrified indignation. But Ms. Simpson and Ms. Robert understand that sometimes discretion can be the better part of power. ""Behind the Sheet"" doesn't have the electrifying conceptual bravado of other recent works about the legacy of slavery, like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins's ""An Octoroon"" or this season's astonishing ""Slave Play"" by Jeremy O. Harris. This is, for the most part, a straightforward, conventional work that is not above plying the cliches of scientific breakthrough dramas of yesteryear, right down to a ""eureka"" moment of unexpected inspiration. But the context, in this case, casts shifting, unsettling light on such classic elements. At the play's center are two figures. George (Joel Ripka) is a physician transplanted from Philadelphia to Alabama who has been gifted a small plantation by the prosperous family of his wife (Megan Tusing). Philomena (the excellent Naomi Lorrain) is his wife's servant, who doubles, chores permitting, as George's invaluable assistant. She is also heavily pregnant with his child when the play begins.

Everything that happens here is predicated on its characters' matter-of-fact acceptance of a status quo that now seems beyond comprehension or tolerance. As Philomena says to another slave, Lewis (Shawn Randall), who fantasizes about freedom, ""How does someone imagine that when they've never experienced it?"" The education of Philomena gives the play its moral structure, which parallels and intersects with the more familiar arc of a maverick scientist's progress. Only 19 when the play begins, Philomena is a woman of self-contained poise and intelligence. Acting as a liaison and troubleshooter between George and the increasing number of slave women who become his patients and subjects, she knows she has it good. She feels sympathy, slightly detached, for the others, whose surgeries she witnesses firsthand. But despite the precise and horrible catalog of side effects of these women's conditions -- lacerating scars, burning seepage, an abiding stench they try to disguise with homemade perfumes -- she doesn't really understand what they are going through. Then she has her own disastrous experience of giving birth, and her role in George's house -- and his life -- is altered forever. Embodied with wonderfully delicate ambivalence by Ms. Lorrain, Philomena is the audience's surrogate in coming to consciousness. But it's the developing and changing bond among the slave women -- and their different degrees of resignation to their lot -- that gives the play its heart. Portrayed by Nia Calloway, Cristina Pitter, Amber Reauchean Williams and Jehan O. Young, they're all first-rate. They convey a bone-deep familiarity with one another that is obviously the product of much thoughtful rehearsal. (Philomena to Lewis, after he says he likes to keep to himself: ""We survive longer when we don't."")

Each of their characters has to some extent been defined by archetypal shorthand -- the funny one, the angry one, the helpful one, etc. But the actresses here inhabit their parts with grounding, defining detail and without comic or tragic exaggeration. To a one, they convey how a situation that is reprehensible to contemporary eyes is simply life to these women. They speak of parents sold to other masters, of children left behind, with a wistful acceptance and pragmatism. (Ms. Young's character to Philomena, talking about Lewis: ""Might as well love him while he's still here."") The white performers, rounded out by Stephen James Anthony, don't turn their characters into Simon Legree-like villains. They, too, are products of a warping time and place. But it's impossible not to shudder when you see George's perception toward Philomena flicker between that of solicitous lover and condescending, even contemptuous owner. The design team -- Lawrence E. Moten III (set), Sarah Woodham (costumes), Adam Honore (lighting) and Fan Zhang (sound) -- matches the eloquent understatement of Ms. Simpson's script. The production is punctuated by haunting silhouettes of women reaching out in pain and a sequence that presents them as anatomical specimens, gathered to be observed and analyzed. These voiceless moments paradoxically give a resonant voice to women who never got to tell their stories. ""Behind the Sheet"" may be a quiet play. But its echoes are thunderous.",Charly Evon Simpson's quietly commanding play chronicles gynecological experimentation on American slave women in the antebellum South.,54079d21-113b-5313-a12b-956a392f5270,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/19/arts/19behind1/19behind1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=404636bb531444a0c9f76445662c3f8c81e2eb2d06a8b5d87ff71371e1e339cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joel Ripka and Naomi Lorrain in ""Behind the Sheet.""",54079d21-113b-5313-a12b-956a392f5270,N24News/imgs/54079d21-113b-5313-a12b-956a392f5270.jpg,10
Style,Wait. Is That Hillary Clinton? Let's Go Say Hi.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/14/style/hillary-clinton-new-york-sightings.html,"Cynthia Erivo was downstairs at the Bernard B. Jacobs Theater last Sunday, preparing for her final performance as Celie in the Broadway show ""The Color Purple."" By now, she was used to the muffled noise of theatergoers slipping into their seats before the show began. But this afternoon the clatter was altogether different. First there was a rumble of heavy footsteps, followed by a burst of applause and cheers that reverberated deep into the theater's subterranean dressing rooms and lasted nearly 10 minutes. Someone famous had arrived. And Ms. Erivo knew who it might be. ""Hillary's in the building,"" she told a colleague. Hillary Clinton and former President Bill Clinton were winding their way to their seats through a crush of well-wishers, including Gayle King, Debra Messing and the Vogue editor Anna Wintour, many of whom clapped and shouted ""We love you, Hillary,"" and ""God bless you."" Onlookers captured the racket on their iPhones as Mrs. Clinton waved and posed for selfies. Ms. Erivo had invited the couple (via a Clinton staff member the actress knew) to see ""The Color Purple"" weeks after Mrs. Clinton's defeat in the November presidential election. ""I thought this might be a wonderful thing for her,"" Ms. Erivo said in an interview on Tuesday. ""It's healing -- a way for her to forget for an evening.""

Many people might have expected Mrs. Clinton to hole up in her Westchester County compound for months after a brutal campaign season and election loss to her Republican rival, President-elect Donald J. Trump. But in recent weeks, Mrs. Clinton has emerged from the Chappaqua woods with her husband and family in tow, much to the delight of New Yorkers who have embraced her as a battle-scarred heroine, and seem to want to help the former Democratic presidential candidate get over her election blues.

In late November, she made a surprise appearance at Unicef's Snowflake Ball, where she presented an award to the pop singer Katy Perry, a prominent supporter of her campaign and who sang at the Democratic National Convention last summer. Weeks later she was photographed greeting friends at her granddaughter's dance performance in Manhattan. On Dec. 13, the rapper Fat Joe posted a selfie with Ms. Clinton on Instagram after he ran into her at dinner at Rao's. (According to Page Six, Mrs. Clinton was dining with the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein and his wife, the fashion designer Georgina Chapman.) And that same week Mrs. Clinton supped with Ralph Lauren at the Polo Bar as other diners, including Christie Brinkley, orbited her table.

One of those in attendance was Laura Brown, the editor in chief of InStyle, who wrote on her Instagram account that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lauren ate hamburgers that night: ""Big, juicy, fantastic burgers. And wine, and chocolate sundaes."" Ms. Brown said hello to Mrs. Clinton and hugged her twice, writing on Instagram, ""'I love you Hillary Clinton,' I said."" For some, the appreciation is more than political. Steve Tyrell performs at the Cafe Carlyle every Christmas, where he croons Frank Sinatra hits and old standards for a holiday crowd. In early December, he got word that Marc Mezvinsky, the husband of Chelsea Clinton, made a reservation for him and his wife. They were a no-show. A few days later, Mr. Tyrell said in an interview, Ms. Clinton made a reservation for four.

Mr. Tyrell knows the Clintons; they have exchanged letters about his music for years. Chelsea played the singer's recording of the classic ""The Way You Look Tonight"" at her wedding, he said. So when Mrs. Clinton, her husband, her daughter and her son-in-law arrived for the 8:45 show on Dec. 17, they were seated at a prime table near the stage. ""It was the first time they'd been out to see music, and I was completely knocked out,"" Mr. Tyrell said. He sang Ira Gershwin's ""I Can't Get Started"" and told a story about how he changed the lyrics on his 1999 album ""A New Standard"" to reflect the Clinton presidency. He sang ""The Way You Look Tonight"" for Chelsea. And he dedicated the last song of his set, ""That's Life,"" to Mrs. Clinton. When he got to the lyrics about picking oneself up after falling flat, Mr. Tyrell said the crowd of 100 or so leapt to their feet and cheered. Mrs. Clinton beamed and clapped her hands overhead. ""It was a very personal performance,"" Mr. Tyrell said. ""It gave everyone this feeling that they were seeing something special."" Whatever one's politics, said Mr. Tyrell, Mrs. Clinton's decades of public service should be recognized. ""I think she should be appreciated,"" he said, ""not be told: 'Lock her up. Lock her up.'""

Mrs. Clinton has, of course, emerged for more formal affairs. On Tuesday, she attended the opening of a new exhibition and museum space at the State Department where the Hillary Clinton Pavilion bears her name. (The ceiling is made of glass.) She and her husband are expected to attend Mr. Trump's inauguration on Jan. 20. And on Feb. 16, Mrs. Clinton will speak at a ceremony at Grand Central Terminal to mark the issuing of a stamp honoring the fashion designer Oscar de la Renta, a close family friend. Through a spokesman, Mrs. Clinton declined to comment on her outings around New York. There have also been more private family moments that onlookers have found themselves unexpectedly witnessing. On Dec. 27, Mike Smith, a fund-raiser for Episcopal Relief & Development and a former reporter for The New York Times, was with his family and friends at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., when one of the women in his group told him that Chelsea Clinton was working out on a treadmill. Later, at about 6:30 p.m., Mrs. Clinton and the former president, along their daughter and their son-in-law, sat down to supper in a semiprivate alcove in the dining room.

During the evening, Mr. Smith said, ""the awareness of their presence built; we decided to send them a bottle of wine."" (It was Chianti.) Chelsea Clinton and her husband left after they finished their meal. ""Everyone was buzzing but being respectful, keeping their distance,"" Mr. Smith said. ""But once Bill and Hillary got up and moved to the hallway, people started standing and applauding and, at that point, they stopped, and started greeting people."" One of the women in Mr. Smith's group introduced herself to Mr. Clinton. ""Hey Hillary!"" Mr. Smith recalled the former president's telling his wife. ""Look! These are the people who bought us the wine!"" Mrs. Clinton, Mr. Smith added, posed for photographs and ""seemed to be very moved, taking the time to greet every person.""","Hillary Clinton is popping up in restaurants and at social events around town, and being embraced by New Yorkers who seem to want to help her get over her election loss.",47f08f9d-38aa-50fa-b8fa-9b32a3580904,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/15/fashion/15HILLARYJP2/15HILLARYJP2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=650854ce09bd6e34c14f67f533b83388887759b5c9f5b75f20e627ad06211b75&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Clintons at Café Carlyle in Manhattan with Steve Tyrell, center, and others.",47f08f9d-38aa-50fa-b8fa-9b32a3580904,N24News/imgs/47f08f9d-38aa-50fa-b8fa-9b32a3580904.jpg,15
Food,Chairman of Elite Wine Group Resigns Amid Its Sexual Harassment Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/dining/drinks/court-master-sommeliers-chairman-resigns.html,"The chairman of the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas, resigned on Friday, after a week of turmoil at the most elite organization in American wine. In a New York Times report last week, 13 women went public with accusations of sexual misconduct in the court's highest ranks. On Thursday, as calls mounted for the entire 13-member board to resign, The Times sent questions to the chairman, Devon Broglie, about a woman who said he had an inappropriate sexual relationship with her in 2013, before he became chairman. At the time, she was a junior-level candidate for the master sommelier title and he was her mentor. The woman, Marie-Louise Friedland, said she approached The Times instead of the organization because she did not trust the board's ability to investigate itself. Mr. Broglie, 46, the top wine buyer for the Whole Foods Market chain, has been chairman since 2018, and was a member of the group's ethics committee, which handles sexual misconduct claims.

""All I want is an organization whose board follows their own rules,"" Ms. Friedland said, ""and that steps in to protect people from experiencing this again."" Mr. Broglie referred questions about his relationship with Ms. Friedland to the court on Thursday. By Friday evening, neither he nor the court had responded to multiple requests for comment. A spokeswoman for the court said Mr. Broglie's resignation as chairman was unrelated to Ms. Friedland's allegations, and was already under discussion when The Times approached the board on Thursday with questions about them. He remains a member of the court. In his resignation letter, Mr. Broglie wrote: ""I deeply apologize to all the women whose lives and careers have been negatively impacted by the predatory actions of any Master Sommelier. I put my best effort forward in changing the course of the organization, I recognize that my effort fell short."" All of the women who came forward to The Times have been candidates for the title of master sommelier, an honor conferred by the court after a long process of evaluations and exams, some of which are graded in secret. All of the men are master sommeliers who had the power to help, or hurt, the women's progress. Ten men have been suspended from court activities by the board, pending investigations into the sexual-misconduct allegations against them. Another, Geoff Kruth, had been accused by 11 women; he resigned from the court and forfeited his title.

Last week, the board apologized to the women and announced that it would hire an independent firm to ""examine all allegations to the fullest extent possible."" That response did not satisfy many of the court's members, many of whom called for Mr. Broglie and the entire board to resign on social media. The court's roughly 150 members have been invited to meet next Wednesday to weigh the future of the remaining board members. According to a Friday letter from the interim leader, Virginia Philip, the current board is conducting a search for a chief executive, has retained a lawyer to conduct sexual misconduct investigations, and strengthened the group's nonfraternization policy to reflect a ""zero-tolerance"" stance on abuses of power, discrimination and harassment. The Times's reporting showed that the board -- past and present -- has long been aware of a pattern of coercive sexual contact between masters and candidates, and that the rule about reporting sexual contact is widely disregarded. Several women also told The Times that they had told board members about instances of sexual misconduct, and were ignored. Until last month, the only way a member could report a complaint was by formal notification of the board. Nine of the men under investigation are former board members. Ms. Friedland said she was working at Restaurant Congress in Austin, Texas, in 2013 when she met Mr. Broglie. As one of the top wine buyers for Whole Foods Market, where he has worked since 2001, he was already a celebrity in Austin's small wine community when he became a master sommelier in 2011. (Whole Foods Market was bought by Amazon in 2017, but was founded and remains based in Austin.)

At 25, she was on the lowest rung of the master sommelier ladder: She had passed the introductory exam, and joined a study group to practice for the next level, while also working full-time. Mr. Broglie offered to help her study for the tasting portion of the exam in private sessions at his home, she said. A co-worker who corroborated her account said she remembers being surprised that Mr. Broglie would confer such a privilege on a junior candidate. (One-on-one time with a master sommelier is a coveted advantage for any candidate.)

Ms. Friedland, now 32, said that the tasting sessions soon proved to be preludes to sexual invitations. ""At first I was flattered, but also very confused and afraid,"" she said. ""I never enjoyed our encounters, and really tried to make that clear in the hopes that he would stop trying."" She said she rejected most of his sexual advances, but had to do so in a friendly way in order to preserve the professional relationship. Eventually, they had sex twice, she said: once at his home and once at a hotel in Dallas, after a group wine tasting held by GuildSomm, the court's educational spinoff. At the time, the court had no rules against such a relationship. ""I forced myself in my head to treat it as a fling or relationship, to be able to wrap my brain around the interactions,"" Ms. Friedland said. ""But it never fit. We weren't dating. We never spoke about it. I felt like I was on call for sex from someone I couldn't say no to."" As she advanced in the wine profession, that power dynamic -- and the question of whether she had earned her success -- haunted her. She moved to San Francisco to work as a sommelier at Quince, one of the most prestigious and popular restaurants in San Francisco, then became wine director at State Bird Provisions, a ""dream job."" Still, she said, the financial cost of living in San Francisco, on top of the emotional cost of working with the many master sommeliers in the Bay Area, was too high. She eventually left the city, the profession and the court. She is now a candidate for a master's degree in gastronomy at Boston University. ""I didn't want to give up learning,"" she said. ""But I knew I could never do it through the court again."" This week, all 27 female members of the court, including the two who serve on the board, Virginia Philip and Laura Williamson, signed a letter apologizing to the women who came forward and demanding a complete overhaul of the organization. Three high-profile women -- Pascaline Lepeltier, Laura Maniec Fiorvanti and Alpana Singh -- resigned from the court.

Ms. Singh, 43, has been a master sommelier since 2003; she was the first woman of color and the first (and only) person of South Asian descent to earn the title in the United States. She said Thursday that although she had tried for years to be a voice for change inside the court, she should have deployed her privilege as a master sommelier to challenge what she called the board's sexist, racist and homophobic culture, instead of using it to further her own success. ""Our focus now should be on helping the survivors get justice and undoing what has been done to them,"" she said. ""The gaslighting and grooming of women that goes on in this industry is built in, and we have no choice but to tear it down."" ""We all want justice and transparency,"" said Sara Floyd, who also earned her master sommelier title in 2003. ""I also want the entire board to resign, transparency on grades, and the election bylaws changed."" Ms. Floyd said the requirement that those who run for the board also work as top-level examiners, a time-consuming volunteer commitment, is just another way that the court's systems exclude female, younger and less wealthy members. ""This is exactly how we got this terrible system that allowed sexual predators to get away with it for years,"" she said. Bobby Stuckey, a master sommelier in Colorado, said he also believes the entire board should be replaced. Knowing what the members have now learned, he said, ""I don't see how you can look at anyone on this board and be sure they aren't part of the problem.""",Devon Broglie is the latest figure in the Court of Master Sommeliers to be accused of an inappropriate relationship.,9e680d1f-ad50-53cd-8c1a-db43d65d0176,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/06/lens/06sommeliers1/06sommeliers1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4c10748a6be4b3cf8e2b6c73af2e664a7ae9bc43f79d5dbcc50d2c044281f027&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Devon Broglie resigned Friday as chairman of the board of the Court of Master Sommeliers, Americas.

Style,Life Without Longing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/09/style/love-infatuation-longing.html,"Romantic obsession is my first language. I live in a world of fantasies, infatuations and love poems. Sometimes I wonder if the yearning I've felt for others was more of a yearning for yearning itself. I've pined insatiably and repeatedly: for strangers, new lovers, unrequited flames. While the subjects changed, that feeling always remained. Perhaps, then, I have not been so infatuated with the people themselves, but with the act of longing. Even when the longing was excruciating, it fulfilled a purpose for me: namely, the purpose of making meaning in this life. Crushes are like little treadmills of hope in the abyss. We may actually be going nowhere, but there is the sensation of forward motion -- something to anticipate, a reason for being, a distraction from death and larger existential questions like ""What is everything?"" and ""What am I doing here?""

Even my attempts at self-love, a concept that still eludes me, have been marked by acquisition, stabs at forward motion, the illusion that we ever arrive at completion. In my 20s I really bought into it, reading copious self-help books, consulting with psychics, attending new-age workshops. I sought to ""become a whole person,"" as though that were some kind of finite destination one could arrive at and then remain there, static; as though the fractured nature of existence itself isn't already some kind of overarching complete picture, our holes and missing pieces a sort of broken perfection.

What would I have done if I had actually landed on some final, immutable me whom I embraced with all my heart? For the sake of my own hunger for pursuit, I would have likely thrown her back in the water and kept looking. I would have been sad to give up the quest. Likewise, I've sought to fulfill my longing for something bigger than myself -- something, for the sake of simplicity, I will call a higher power -- through a particular feeling. I've wanted a higher power to provide that same narcotic delight one feels in the early stages of a relationship. In those rare white-light moments when I have felt a holy bliss, I've quickly purchased a candle or crystal, hoping to pocket the feeling. Unfortunately, that feeling cannot be contained in an object any more than it can be pinned down to one human being.

It is so easy to confuse spiritual longing with a craving for romantic love. Beautiful people are everywhere, whereas the desire for some kind of eternal beauty or ineffable truth is more nebulous, always just out of reach. Recently, on a solo holiday trip to Paris, I saw tangible beauty all over the city: in twinkling silver lights, the blackness of my coffee, the florid cemeteries hinting at a more immortal mortality. The beauty conjured feelings of deep rapture, but also a simultaneous ache of longing. I couldn't figure out why the beauty made me so sad.

I felt envious of the students' youth and what appeared to be a new, blossoming love affair -- maybe their first of early adulthood. They couldn't freeze that moment any more than I could return to the past, but they were in it now. This is what I am sad about, I thought. There are no more romantic firsts for me, at least not as a young person.

I thought about a former lover who had grown up in Paris: the youthful exploits he described, the wild romantic and sexual explorations he'd had in Pigalle. I decided to go to the area and retrace his steps down the Boulevard de Clichy. I thought that perhaps if I could see what he had seen, recreate the journey, then maybe I could siphon some of that feeling of newness for myself. But in walking down the boulevard, I was surprised to discover that it was mostly sex shops, a sex club or two, nothing I hadn't seen before. I didn't feel transformed into a rapturous state of newness. Was I missing something?

Afterward, I decided to walk up Montmartre and meditate at Sacre-Coeur. It was freezing on the way up as I turned the corners of dark, cobblestone streets, then scaled the many stairs of the last hill. Suddenly, I saw the immense, glowing white stone domes of the church jutting up into the night sky. Then I heard a voice say, I've been waiting for you. I recognized this as the voice of my higher power. It's a still, quiet voice, and it comes to me when I am very quiet and very alone. I don't think I needed to go to a church to hear the voice. I don't think a church is any holier than a sex shop. But I feel that my higher power likes it when I seek. Perhaps the longing itself is holy.

Look what I do for you, I said to my higher power, shivering in the wind. Look how far I am willing to go for you. Meditating in the church, its colossal, swooping arches lit by the fires of hundreds of red glass prayer candles -- so many wishes and desires here on Earth -- I realized that my sadness had not been romantic in essence, but concerned the ephemeral nature of all beauty. It's sad that there's nothing we as human beings can do to freeze a beautiful moment. It's sad how many beautiful moments have come and gone.","Who would I be if I wasn't hustling to make some other person, real or imagined, fall in love with me?",4e39b014-57e6-5dae-8a05-65a534448d8f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/10/fashion/10THELOOK1/10THELOOK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3c220d544fa6654a236717730f00039940ed18e1330ed1aed4efb664e4e8a203&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,February brings out the seeker in all of us.,4e39b014-57e6-5dae-8a05-65a534448d8f,N24News/imgs/4e39b014-57e6-5dae-8a05-65a534448d8f.jpg,15
Media,"As New Year's Eve Ball Drops, the Free Press Gets a Moment in the Spotlight",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/business/media/2019-new-years-eve-times-square-journalists.html,"As New Year's Eve Ball Drops, the Free Press Gets a Moment in the Spotlight

Television viewers on New Year's Eve tune in for performances by the latest hitmakers and nostalgia acts. This time around, 11 journalists -- ranging from familiar faces like Martha Raddatz of ABC to behind-the-scenes editors like Karen Toulon of Bloomberg News -- shared the Times Square limelight, part of an effort by organizers to recognize the erosion of press freedoms at home and abroad. The journalists were tasked Monday with pressing the crystal button that initiates the minute-long descent of the New Year's Eve Ball, a prime moment on a night that attracts tens of millions of viewers. Just before they pressed it, the journalists gathered around the button, cheering and waving to the crowd before bringing the ball down. Among those invited was Karen Attiah, who edited the Washington Post columns of Jamal Khashoggi, the Saudi dissident and American resident who was murdered in Turkey this year by Saudi agents; Mr. Holt of NBC; Alisyn Camerota of CNN; Vladimir Duthiers of CBS; and Jon Scott, a weekend anchor on Fox News.

Editors from Time, The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times were also on the bill, along with Maria Ressa, a journalist in the Philippines whose news site, Rappler, has been threatened by the country's authoritarian president, Rodrigo Duterte. Ms. Ressa, along with Mr. Khashoggi, was featured on the cover of Time this month for its annual person of the year honor.

The reporters and editors were part of broadcasts featuring stars like John Legend, Shawn Mendes, Jennifer Lopez, Bebe Rexha, Sting and a reunited New Kids on the Block. Journalists do not carry quite the same star power as past honorees, like Muhammad Ali or Lady Gaga, who memorably kissed the mayor at the time, Michael R. Bloomberg, in the first moments of 2012. But even a brief recognition from viewers will go a long way, said Joel Simon, the executive director of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a nonprofit group that promotes press rights and helped coordinate the event.

""People who are watching across the country will see the media together, standing on the stage, visually united behind this principle,"" Mr. Simon said in an interview. ""That's a positive message at a time when journalists around the world are threatened as never before.""

Tim Tompkins, the president of the Times Square Alliance, has sought in recent years to leverage the ball drop's worldwide audience to promote civic causes. Tarana Burke, the founder of the #MeToo movement, appeared onstage last year. David Miliband, who runs the International Rescue Committee, a humanitarian aid group for refugees, was a guest on Dec. 31, 2014.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. This year's idea came about after a conversation between Mr. Tompkins and an acquaintance from his college days, Jacob Weisberg, a former editor in chief of Slate and a Committee to Protect Journalists board member.

""The two pictures that are sent around the world generally are people kissing each other with confetti falling and the people who appear on the stage,"" Mr. Tompkins said. ""We wanted to use that in a deliberate way."" ""It's fitting to celebrate the free press as we reflect on where we've been during the past year and what we value most as a society,"" he added. Given the attention span of viewers on a night dedicated more to carousing than to the Constitution, Mr. Simon said the televised image of journalists, representing a range of news organizations, would be a potent symbol. ""You have to send a simple and essentially visual message,"" he said. ""The basic principles of press freedom are unifying, and it's something that people can celebrate even if they have divergent views.""",The Times Square Alliance joined with the Committee to Protect Journalists to send millions of viewers a message on the importance of journalism.,6a2b5247-8bf5-548e-80ef-3196e46497dd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/31/business/31balldrop1-print/31balldrop1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=84d10f9b9bf408650a3aa523364bfe785a33cf523e0f1d1a10f0d96050bb20af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New Year's Eve in Times Square two years ago.

Earlier this month thousands of Hong Kong residents began marching against a bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland. The timing of the demonstrations makes them ever more potent: This month marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when Chinese troops unleashed their firepower on a throng of protesters in Beijing who were calling for democracy in the Communist country. This new documentary revisits the seven weeks that led up to the killings and maps out how a peaceful, student-led movement ended in unthinkable carnage. The director Ian MacMillan weaves archival footage with testimony from protesters, witnesses and Communist Party insiders who watched the tragedy unfold.

MIKE EPPS: ONLY ONE MIKE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Throughout his 20 years in entertainment, Mike Epps (""Next Friday,"" ""How High"") has usually appeared on the sidelines playing goofy secondary characters. But when it comes to comedy, he steals the show. In this new special, the actor and comic performs in front of a packed house in Washington, delivering salacious one-liners (some more juvenile than others) and ruminating on relationships and family. One moment he's flashing a toothy smile and explaining how old age can slow down a man's sex drive. The next he's recalling how his daughter's boyfriend won him over (it involved some potent weed).

MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE (1986) Stream on the Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon, iTunes or Vudu. This beloved dramedy, directed by Stephen Frears, tackles homophobia, racism and sociopolitical inequality with one too many subplots. But the thread that holds it together is the impenetrable romance between Omar (Gordon Warnecke), a young Pakistani man in South London, and Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis), a childhood friend who grew up to be a street punk. After his uncle asks him to take over a rundown laundromat, Omar crosses paths with Johnny and enlists his help. The two transform the dirty establishment into a glamorous one, rekindle their spark and get caught up in a drug deal along the way. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the movie a ""rude, wise, vivid social comedy."" He added: ""'My Beautiful Laundrette' has the broad scope and the easy pace that one associates with our best theatrical films.""

DAMNED Stream on Britbox. Before Himesh Patel landed the lead role in the upcoming Beatles movie ""Yesterday"" (opening Friday), he co-starred in this British workplace sitcom about social workers who focus on children services. The show deftly balances its weighty subject material -- some cases involve student-teacher relationships, missing teenagers and prostitution -- with a hilarious portrayal of humdrum work life akin to that of ""The Office."" ""Damned"" only ran on Channel 4 for two seasons, but critics gave it a thumbs up: The Telegraph called it ""unforgiving, warm and extremely funny.""",A new documentary peels back the curtain on the Tiananmen Square protests.

Automobiles,Cadillac's Answer to German Coupes,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/19/automobiles/autoreviews/19cadillac.html,"BETTER bold than boring. That's been the Cadillac design ethos since the CTS introduced the company's starched-collar Art and Science styling theme in 2002. At the time, I unkindly described the new sedan as a Cubist snowplow. Still, that CTS was a major improvement over the frumpy German-built Catera it replaced, despite some clumsiness in its execution of Art and Science geometry. By 2008 the CTS was rightly seen as the elixir of youth, re-energizing Cadillac and expanding the division's sales to include retirement-village visitors, rather than just residents. That second-generation model made the CTS a legitimate luxury player, with Lexus levels of comfort and technology -- and enough spirit to romp with Infinitis. Both the sedan and a Sport Wagon that followed in 2009 smoothed the rougher styling edges; suddenly Cadillac had a pair of handsome rogues on its hands. Now comes a two-door CTS, the first four-seat Caddy coupe since the senior-centric Eldorado ended its half-century run in 2002. This leaves Cadillac just one body style -- a convertible -- shy of the four that the BMW 3 Series and Mercedes-Benz E-Class rely on to lead their respective compact and midsize luxury segments.

While Cadillac might have been forgiven for playing it safe, its new coupe is instead a brazen slap to the face of genteel luxury coupes. From its glittering grille to the boomerang taillamps on a tail the size and shape of Paul Bunyan's ax, the CTS coupe is a literal wedge issue in terms of styling. Several bowled-over onlookers said the Cadillac looked like an auto-show dream car, the kind of thing you'd only see twirling onstage to a thumping dance beat. All angular, meaty slabs, with tiny windows that could be portals for laser gunsights, the Cadillac looks as if a stealth bomber just touched down in the neighborhood.

Viewed another way, this CTS could and should be the official car of the ""Jersey Shore"" cast; its ab-forward style carries a whiff of hair gel and Axe body spray. But if you find that Situation attractive -- and any high-attitude car, from the Chrysler 300 to the BMW 6 Series coupe, finds both fans and detractors -- the CTS could well end up like the Chrysler, a crossover hit that won over both the urban audience and self-styled Sopranos of the suburbs. Controversy dissolves inside, soothed by a cabin that should please even conservative luxury shoppers. As in the sedan or wagon, the interior is graveyard quiet and smartly professional. One questionable touch: doors that open with electronic touch pads, as on the Corvette, abandoning conventional door handles inside and out.

The CTS's multimedia touch screen rises automatically from the top of the dashboard, and its functions are blessedly intuitive. Bands of attractive wood stripe the dashboard, doors, steering wheel and shifter. The deeply sculptured seats are handsome and comfortable, if a few moves short of the multiadjustable buckets in some rivals. A few elements, including a wonky-feeling glovebox button, reminded me that this was no Mercedes. But that's when I also reminded myself that the midsize Cadillac's price is more in line with smaller coupes like the 3 Series and Infiniti G37. CTS pricing opens at $38,990; my feature-laden Premium Collection edition started at $47,825 and rose to $50,035 with options including 19-inch polished aluminum wheels, steering-wheel shift buttons and larger disc brakes that deliver a BMW-beating stopping distance from 70 m.p.h. The 3.6-liter V-6, which ably motivates the Chevy Camaro as well, is powerful and sophisticated. But while 304 horsepower delivers a reasonable 6.4-second sprint to 60 m.p.h., the hefty Cadillac is actually nipped by the 4-cylinder turbo Audi A5 and the 268-horsepower Mercedes. And should a BMW 3 Series or Infiniti G37 come calling, well, ouch. I drove the torchingly fast BMW 335is coupe just before the Caddy, and the Bimmer skimmed the road like a water bug in comparison. As a luxury sport coupe, the Cadillac's real issue is that it feels big on the outside, small on the inside and heavy throughout.

Most luxury coupes (aside from the roomy Mercedes E350) demand back-row compromises, but if rear headroom is a priority, save your scalp and look elsewhere. The trunk's practicality is also hindered by a tiny opening and cheap gooseneck hinges that steal space or clamp down on cargo that gets in their way. Worse yet, the CTS vividly illustrates General Motors' nagging problem with vehicular heft: as with Land Rover and its overfed S.U.V.'s, recent G.M. models are inexplicably heavier than their competitors. When Car and Driver tested the coupe, the scale's readout sneaked past two tons, making the CTS the chunkiest among its competitors, some 300 pounds more than the BMW or the roomier Mercedes E350. Contributing to the CTS's feeling of excessive size is the nearly horizontal rear glass that's hard to see through; the optional rear parking camera seems a must. Yet the CTS hides its bulk reasonably well, especially with the Summer Performance Package that adds 19-inch wheels and tires (and stiffens the suspension). The Cadillac really sticks to the pavement, even badly broken pavement, reminding you of what a fine chassis lies beneath. Like its siblings, the coupe shows off extensive structural and sound-damping efforts, making it silent and controlled over all varieties of pavement, the equal of any Lexus. And while I found the Caddy's steering unnaturally heavy at times, it also has a feeling of precision that Lexus doesn't always match. An available 6-speed manual transmission (not offered on the base model) is another attraction; a 6-speed automatic is standard. This segment, of course, resembles a casting call for willowy runway models. Among the Audi A5 and S5, Mercedes E-Class and BMW 3 Series especially, you could argue all day over which one is prettiest. But those Euro models are also notable for their elegance, a nearly feminine grace. The CTS is their darkly masculine foil, the yang to their yin. Which side of that philosophy you're on is up to you. INSIDE TRACK: Nothing subtle this way comes.","While Cadillac might have been forgiven for playing it safe, its new coupe is instead a slap to the face of genteel luxury coupes.",7757b09b-6744-59c5-9d38-ea1f40be1071,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/19/automobiles/WHEE-1/WHEE-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=69303ee4249fbc1470ed1aa65f1c4b416f820d0e08b0b4cada20a6c2399e85f6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"RAKISH The two-door version of the 2011 CTS, with the same wheelbase as the sedan, is bulky in the rear view.",7757b09b-6744-59c5-9d38-ea1f40be1071,N24News/imgs/7757b09b-6744-59c5-9d38-ea1f40be1071.jpg,23
Automobiles,"Free Service, for One Owner Only",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/09/automobiles/free-service-for-one-owner-only.html,"For some buyers, a new vehicle's allure goes beyond handling, styling and prestige: They parse the terms of the warranty and even whether maintenance is covered. Some BMW enthusiasts were surprised this summer when the automaker announced limitations on the transfer of its four-year or 50,000-mile complimentary maintenance plan when a car goes to a subsequent buyer. Previously, a selling point was being able to transfer the remainder of free maintenance coverage when the car was resold. Under the revision, coverage may be transferred only to ""a current or former spouse or spousal equivalent, child, sibling, parent, grandparent, or grandchild."" The change took effect on July 1 and applies to 2015 or later models. BMW estimates that its maintenance coverage saves original owners $2,000 over a typical 36-month lease. ""It's a very expensive program,"" said Kenn Sparks, a business spokesman for BMW, costing the company ""many millions of dollars"" a year. He said the change was necessary to sustain the program for original owners.

The change is unlikely to have much effect on resale values, Mr. Sparks said, because the majority of lease customers keep their vehicles for 36 months and ""those who purchase outright tend to keep them much longer."" Eric Ibara, director of residual consulting at Kelley Blue Book, agreed with that assessment and wrote in an email that Kelley was not adjusting BMW's residual values -- the projected value of the car at the end of the lease -- as a result of the policy change. Only a few other automakers limit the transfer of free maintenance to subsequent owners, and a New York Times survey of 30 mainstream auto brands suggests that there is no emerging trend to impose limits. However, a few automakers are placing limits on the transfer of new-car warranties. There is a difference between free maintenance and free factory-scheduled maintenance, which generally covers just an oil change and filter, said Jack Gillis, director of public affairs for the Consumer Federation of America and author of ""The Car Book."" Free maintenance of the type offered by BMW and its fellow brand, Mini, is better because it covers that and more, he said. BMW's plan, for example, also covers BMW parts and labor and what are called ""wear and tear"" items like brake pads and rotors and windshield wiper blades.

""Covered maintenance is really a tremendous consumer benefit,"" Mr. Gillis said. ""It essentially means that you are driving free of any maintenance costs for that time period -- in the case of BMW, 48 months or 50,000 miles."" Among brands that offer some type of free maintenance, those that limit transfers to other owners, in addition to BMW, are Fiat, Hyundai and Kia.

Movies,"'Chinese Portrait' Review: A Snapshot of a Country, Artfully Composed",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/chinese-portrait-review.html,"In its title and its panoramic scope, ""Chinese Portrait"" promises a snapshot of modern China, with scenes that show life in settings urban and rural, industrial and agrarian, scenic and seedy. This documentary's human subjects are young and old. But in intriguing, sometimes unsatisfying ways, it leaves the synthesis to the viewer. It is an experimental film more than it is a state-of-the-nation address, inviting consideration of how each of its successive tableaus -- just about the entirety of the movie -- came to be created.

The director, the veteran Chinese filmmaker Wang Xiaoshuai (""Beijing Bicycle""), shot ""Chinese Portrait"" over a decade on a combination of film and video. Many scenes consist of a single shot, and the vignettes are generally separated by brief bits of visible film leader. The pieces of dialogue that can be heard go unsubtitled. And while the film depicts a diverse cross-section of Chinese life -- from horses grazing in the countryside to a man in a respiratory mask in a smoggy cityscape; from Muslims in prayer to a dimly lit celebration -- its primary interest lies in the tension between candid moments and shots that appear artfully composed.

The documentary begins with miners standing by a track at what looks like the opening of a mine shaft. (There are no title cards or other identifiers.) Are the miners' stoic stances natural or acted? What conversations, with the filmmakers or otherwise, took place before and after the cameras rolled? In several shots -- in an office, in a classroom -- one person will stare directly at Wang's camera while others appear oblivious to it. Other images are straightforward person-on-the-street portraits, practically still photographs. The camera is notable for its stillness. Kineticism generally derives from action within a shot: A man stands by a gate at the back of a speeding train while another train rushes by in the opposite direction. A building undergoing demolition partly collapses, stirring up a giant cloud of dust.","A visual take on the vast expanse of a land and its people, compiled over 10 years by Wang Xiaoshuai.",a2edd83b-0b4e-5803-9a7b-492a9eea8ab5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/arts/12chinese-portraitpix/12chinese-portraitpix-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=bfcd42dfce95655b5b734bc02ede000bad9db9a9525772e252e6fd155538d4f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A scene from &ldquo;Chinese Portrait.&rdquo;,a2edd83b-0b4e-5803-9a7b-492a9eea8ab5,N24News/imgs/a2edd83b-0b4e-5803-9a7b-492a9eea8ab5.jpg,5
Economy,Economic Recovery Spreads to the Middle Class,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/16/business/economy/economic-recovery-spreads-to-the-middle-class-.html,"For years, even as the economy recovered and the stock market soared, most American workers saw little evidence of better times in their paychecks. But last month's surprisingly large increase in both average hourly and weekly earnings, along with other encouraging data, has convinced many economists that falling unemployment and increased hiring are finally about to start paying off in terms of wage gains for a broader swath of workers. ""It's the beginning of an uptick, and we should see it continue over the next year or two as the unemployment rate falls and the labor market tightens,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, a private economics and forecasting firm. ""You have to be careful, but my gut instinct is that this is the beginning of better wage performance."" Still, even the seemingly good news for wages in November wasn't clear-cut. Although overall wages increased 0.4 percent -- double what economists had been expecting -- the gain for lower-paid workers in nonsupervisory and production roles increased only 0.2 percent.

Just how much the typical employee's pay might go up in the months ahead -- and whether most workers will see significant gains or just a select few -- is a key question in the economic debate facing Wall Street, academia, officials in the Obama administration and, especially, the Federal Reserve. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Fed policy makers will hold their final meeting of the year, followed by a news conference from Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, where she is expected to provide further hints about when the Fed will begin raising short-term interest rates after keeping them near zero for the last six years. The nascent uptick in wages has prompted further warnings from the more hawkish members of the Fed's policy-making council who want the central bank to start tightening monetary policy sooner, rather than later, to ward off what they see as a potential threat of inflation. But Ms. Yellen and a majority of Fed policy makers, pointing to evidence that inflation remains well under the central bank's 2 percent target, do not appear to be unduly alarmed and probably still prefer to leave interest rates as low as possible until the trend is better established. ""Until it is unambiguous, people can spin it any way they want,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""One month is a curiosity, two months is interesting and three months is a trend.""

The split at the Fed is echoed in Washington, primarily along partisan lines. On Capitol Hill, some Republicans say it is time for the Fed to act, while Democrats in the Obama administration, like Thomas E. Perez, the labor secretary, say there is no rush. ""I welcome the point when my first concern when I get out of bed in the morning is having to address rapid wage growth,"" Mr. Perez said. ""I'm not too worried about inflation."" As for the argument that the Fed needs to move sooner, rather than later, Mr. Perez said he ""couldn't reject that in stronger terms."" ""It's time for the middle class and the aspiring middle class to share in the dividends of their hard work,"" he added. ""The folks at the top end have been doing great and our prosperity hasn't been shared."" By contrast, Representative Kevin P. Brady, a Texas Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, has called on the Fed to move quickly, but even some conservative economists say the plunge in energy prices gives the central bank more flexibility this time around. Tom Gimbel of LaSalle Network said salaries were rising for experienced workers. Nathan Weber for The New York Times ""Historically, inflation is something that gets out of the box because the Fed moves too slowly,"" said Kevin A. Hassett, director of economic policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute and a former Fed economist. ""But we've had a positive energy shock, so the Fed has ample room to wait and see.""

In just the last month, average gasoline prices have dropped by 25 cents, to $2.77 a gallon nationally, according to the federal Energy Information Administration, and more reductions are on the way as crude oil prices continue to fall. And if wages keep rising, the typical American family will have a couple of thousand more dollars to spend in 2015. Extended over the next year, November's 0.4 percent increase in average hourly earnings would equal an annual wage increase of nearly 5 percent, more than double the 2.1 percent increase recorded over the last 12 months. ""If the average is 2 percent, there are a lot of people getting next to nothing,"" Mr. Shepherdson said. ""And 2 percent wage growth when corporate profits are skyrocketing makes people very angry."" But before anyone strikes up ""Happy Days Are Here Again,"" Mr. Shepherdson cautioned that a previous 0.4 percent rise in wages in June 2013 was followed by no increase the next month. Similarly, the 0.4 percent gain in October 2011 also showed no signs of staying power. What might be different this time, Mr. Shepherdson said, is that the rise in average hourly earnings coincides with other positive data, including a fall in jobless claims, a declining unemployment rate and healthy hiring by private employers, as well as an increase in job openings. On Monday, the Federal Reserve reported that industrial production in the United States rose by 1.1 percent in November, and also revised upward the increase for October. Over all, the new data shows factory output in the United States has finally exceeded its prerecession level.

Despite the positive data recently, Fed policy makers have made clear that they won't act on rates this week, or at their next meeting in January, but rather wait at least until March and more likely June 2015, at the earliest, economists said. One possible development on Wednesday, when policy makers wrap up their meeting, is that the Fed will tweak the language in its policy statement and drop its reference to keep rates near zero ""for a considerable time."" Although optimists like Mr. Shepherdson and Mr. Behravesh say the wage gains should become broader as unemployment continues to fall, professionals on the front lines of the labor market say higher-paid, better-educated workers with specialized skills are still getting the greater share of raises right now. ""What people want to see is 1999 or 2004, when companies were saying, 'We'll hire anyone,' "" said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a Chicago staffing firm. ""That's not what's happening now."" Instead, Mr. Gimbel said, salaries are rising in sectors in which experienced workers are harder to find, like technology, finance and higher-level accounting positions, and where salaries tend to be at least $80,000 or more. For recent college graduates with liberal arts degrees, or workers in call centers and in data processing jobs, where yearly wages are less than $50,000, Mr. Gimbel said, ""we're bringing people in at the same salary as 10 years ago."" Mr. Gimbel added that new college graduates were still willing to take jobs they might have rejected in the past, like working in a call center. ""They figure, ""The sooner I get a job, the quicker I can start paying off a mountain of student debt,' "" he said. ""And for guys working as a lifeguard or in the gym, a call center is white-collar experience.""",Many economists are convinced that falling unemployment and increased hiring are finally about to start paying off in terms of wage gains for a broader swath of workers.,7627cb96-f677-5e2d-8b13-93112443c88d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/16/business/Wagesjp/Wagesjp-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=a615bbf960ce7e597291b168c1374a560a989a7d96c5f45998bf1d290cbc6e5e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Representative Kevin P.

Technology,Tunneling Though the Internet on Vacation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/22/technology/personaltech/tunneling-though-the-internet-on-vacation.html,"Q. What do you think about virtual private networks? Do they really work to keep your information secure? I'm going on vacation to Alaska and I bought a VPN package, but I'm still not sure if it's O.K. for me to check my bank account or use the Wi-Fi in Starbucks.

A. Virtual private networks (also known as VPNs) are designed to shield personal information going back and forth over your internet connection by creating an encrypted ""tunnel"" for the data to pass through between your computer (or device) and the VPN server. If you do not have a secure connection -- especially on a public wireless network that anyone could use -- online intruders could potentially spy on the websites you visit and even steal passwords and other credentials you enter. Using a VPN while connected to any unprotected public access network is generally advised for information safety.","A virtual private network will not keep you safe from every online danger, but a good one can help protect your personal data when you're traveling.",8528aafe-eb78-5f78-a276-83fc9079d321,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/23/technology/personaltech/23techtipwebART/23techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=393&w=750&s=2f26ff419cb1819ac72b30644f38cbf05e5ab6c68e9a34c23ea39a33a6aff8d7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,TunnelBear is one of many virtual private network apps for desktop and mobile devices.,8528aafe-eb78-5f78-a276-83fc9079d321,N24News/imgs/8528aafe-eb78-5f78-a276-83fc9079d321.jpg,20

Education,Obama Defends Education Program,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/education/30obama.html,"WASHINGTON  Saying that reforming education is perhaps ""the economic issue of our time,"" President Obama went before a major civil rights organization on Thursday to defend his main education program against criticisms from some minority and teachers groups.

""It's an economic issue when the unemployment rate for folks who've never gone to college is almost double what it is for those who have,"" Mr. Obama said, according to prepared remarks. ""It's an economic issue when eight in 10 new jobs will require workforce training or a higher education by the end of this decade. It's an economic issue when we know countries that outeducate us today will outcompete us tomorrow.""

Mr. Obama, in his speech before the 100th anniversary convention of the National Urban League, acknowledged ""some controversy"" about his education initiative, which he attributed partly to ""a general resistance to change, a comfort with the status quo."" But he chose the civil rights organization as his audience to address specifically the complaints of minority groups that schools and teachers in impoverished communities and inner cities will be unfairly neglected in the competition to meet higher standards and the drive to impose accountability for students' standardized test results.

""Our goal isn't to fire or admonish teachers,"" Mr. Obama said.

Rather, he said the ""Race to the Top"" program, which provides additional federal funds to local schools that meet administration standards  and a companion effort to overhaul the nation's 5,000 worst schools  were ultimately aimed at giving good teachers higher salaries, more support, from supplies to smaller classes, and more training to provide them with career opportunities and financial rewards.

Food,Your New Favorite Curry,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/dining/your-new-favorite-curry.html,"Good morning. I'll tell you what I'm going to do this weekend. I'm going to read Tejal Rao's new column about making Japanese curry in The New York Times Magazine. I'm going to read it, like, four or five times so I get some sense of the technique, and then I'm going to make Sonoko Sakai recipe for concentrated cubes of the stuff -- she calls them curry bricks (above). Curry bricks may be used as the base of a Japanese curry, and definitely to make katsu curry, which is essentially a curry gravy to gloop over rice and serve beneath pork katsu, as they do at the Go Go Curry restaurants in Japan and Manhattan. Katsu curry is one of my favorite things in the whole world to eat.

Also on the menu this weekend: huli huli chicken, which was one of the breakout hits of the summer season on NYT Cooking, a kind of old-school Hawaiian grilled chicken jam that resounded through our kitchens like Billy Ray Cyrus on ""Old Town Road."" I like that with ember-roasted slaw with mint, to which I add a tablespoon of mayonnaise because I like big mayo and I cannot lie. I'm going to hold on to summer as long as I can.

And have you seen this delightful video our Scott Loitsch and Vaughn Vreeland made, about Tan France from ""Queer Eye"" cooking a French omelet for his co-star Antoni Porowski? It may leave you wanting to cook an omelet this weekend as well, for breakfast or lunch, maybe for an early dinner. I know I want to.

But that's not all I want to make! If I can, I'm also going to cook for the week ahead, for the suddenly slightly chilly nights that are beginning to circle, when all my family wants to do for dinner is reheat and sop up. So maybe I'll make a Dutch oven full of Dijon and cognac beef stew. (If you make that recipe this weekend and eat in on Tuesday night? You can thank me when you do: foodeditor@nytimes.com.)

Well,The Fatal Toll of Cheap Cigarettes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/19/well/family/the-fatal-toll-of-cheap-cigarettes.html,"A new study suggests that the availability of cheaper, off-brand cigarettes is associated with an increase in infant mortality.

Researchers writing in JAMA Pediatrics studied the link between cigarette prices and infant mortality in 23 European countries from 2004 through 2014. During this time, there were more than 53 million live births.

After controlling for other factors, they found that a $1.18 increase in average price per pack was associated with a decline of 0.23 deaths per 1,000 babies in the first year of life and 0.16 deaths per 1,000 babies in the second year.

But when a cheap enough brand was available, the number of infant deaths increased. A 10 percent difference between the median price and the price of an off-brand bargain pack was associated with an increase of .07 deaths per 1,000 live births, the researchers found.","The availability of cheaper, off-brand cigarettes is associated with an increase in infant mortality.",598d3a59-e4e1-5eca-ac82-b5d877053957,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/14/well/well_pog_child/well_pog_child-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=401&w=768&s=282c369562c7ece32456ba95e3c5d1cfaa67e7996ea94255fd614f100b50879d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,598d3a59-e4e1-5eca-ac82-b5d877053957,N24News/imgs/598d3a59-e4e1-5eca-ac82-b5d877053957.jpg,18
Real Estate,Kew Gardens: Where New York Doesn't Feel So Urban,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/11/realestate/kew-gardens-where-new-york-doesnt-feel-so-urban.html,"When the two started dating in 2013, they both had apartments in Ditmas Park, a Brooklyn neighborhood that met their bucolic requirements. But while they conducted their courtship at Mimi's Hummus on Cortelyou Road and loved the area's spacious Victorians, they found the neighborhood too un-urban in one respect: the dearth of train lines. When repair work shut down the Q, it made the neighborhood feel like a small town in the middle of nowhere -- and not in a good way.

Googling around for other options, Ms. Ellis found an old New York Times article about Kew Gardens, Queens. ""This feels right for us,"" she told Mr. Toth. A visit confirmed as much: They loved the Tudor houses, the retail strip that felt like a quaint main street and the presence of not only several subway lines, but a Long Island Rail Road station. Even more appealing was the rental they found there: a house dating to the 1920s. A doctor's office takes up part of the first floor, but the couple have the rest of the house, which includes two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a working fireplace, a driveway, the front yard, the attic and the basement. They moved in two and a half years ago and currently pay $2,700 a month.

And whereas most New York musicians struggle to find space for their instruments, Mr. Toth and Ms. Ellis are able to keep two keyboards and two pianos, one of which Ms. Ellis brought with her from Ditmas Park. She frequently hosted ""piano bars"" at her apartment there, and friends would come to drink wine and sing show tunes late into the night. She and Mr. Toth started dating after she invited him to one; they sang a duet of ""Move On"" from ""Sunday in the Park With George."" ""Before, I had the keyboard, but there was no sense of home until I had a piano,"" Mr. Toth said. Ms. Ellis agreed: ""It really feels like a home when you have a piano.""

Since they moved in, he has been so loath to leave home that he decided to stop working as a touring music director. With the encouragement of their real estate agent, he got his license and now works as an agent for Voro, in addition to composing, and he has funneled some of his commissions into producing. The first project for which he will be credited as a producer is a musical version of ""Emma,"" written by Ms. Ellis, with book and lyrics by the playwright Meghan Brown, being workshopped in London this spring. One of the few downsides of their living situation is having to pay a gardener several hundred dollars a month to take care of the lawn and shrubberies. Also, there aren't many good public transit options between Kew Gardens and Ditmas Park, which makes it hard to get together with friends in their old neighborhood. Their regular dinners at Mimi's Hummus were another casualty of the move, but when they were married in the house in February, they were able to persuade Mimi Kitani, the restaurant's founder, to come to them. She cooked for the newlyweds and their two guests in the home's kitchen.

Media,"U.S. Approves T-Mobile-Sprint Merger, a Deal That Would Reshape the Industry",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/26/business/media/sprint-tmobile-merger.html,"The Justice Department on Friday approved the merger of T-Mobile and Sprint, the third- and fourth-largest wireless companies in the United States, saying its antitrust concerns had been addressed and giving its blessing to a deal that would reshape the nation's wireless industry. Critics of the merger have said it would reduce competition by lowering the number of wireless carriers from four to three, resulting in higher cellphone bills. On Friday, those critics, a group that includes attorneys general from several states and Democratic presidential candidates, continued to voice their objections to the deal, saying the combination would harm consumers. Until recently, the Justice Department shared those concerns. In a news briefing on Friday, Makan Delrahim, the Trump administration's top antitrust regulator, said the agency had only decided to approve the deal after T-Mobile and Sprint agreed last week to sell off significant portions of their businesses to the pay-television operator Dish Network as part of a plan to create a potential new major wireless company. Under the agreement's terms, Mr. Delrahim said, ""Dish is in a unique position to succeed."" The merger deal's terms call for T-Mobile, the larger of the two companies, to effectively buy Sprint in an all-stock transaction valued at $26.5 billion. The combined company, to be called T-Mobile and led by T-Mobile's chief executive, John Legere, would be a formidable rival to AT&T, the largest wireless carrier in the country, and Verizon, the second-largest.

Before getting the Justice Department's approval, T-Mobile and Sprint took steps to win over the Federal Communications Commission, which oversees the telecommunications industry. In May, Ajit Pai, the commission's chairman, signaled his support after the companies committed to investing heavily in rural broadband service and the fifth-generation cellular networks known as 5G, which brings faster-than-broadband speeds through the air. [Higher prices? Improved service? Here's what the merger could mean for you.] In addition to extending reliable internet access to rural areas, 5G is expected to fuel the development of autonomous cars and other so-called moonshot projects. President Trump has argued that the technology is critical to national security, citing its importance in his administration's crackdown on the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei. T-Mobile and Sprint have said they would have a more difficult time making progress with 5G as separate businesses than they would as one entity. Although the Justice Department's approval was a crucial step forward for the merger, it is not a done deal. In a rare move last month, the attorneys general of 13 states and the District of Columbia threw a significant obstacle in its path when they sued to block the transaction. On a conference call on Friday, Letitia James, the New York attorney general, said the plan to transform Dish into a fourth major wireless carrier was not realistic. ""Dish has never owned any kind of mobile wireless business,"" she said. ""Dish has no experience building or operating a nationwide mobile wireless network."" Ms. James added that the agreement brokered by the Justice Department would hurt consumers and ""violates antitrust laws.""

T-Mobile and Sprint have reached a $5 billion agreement to give Dish Sprint's prepaid wireless businesses, including Boost Mobile, which is popular with lower-income customers, and some of its airwaves, known as spectrum. Critics have contended that Dish would not be a legitimate competitor to the merged companies because it would only have about nine million customers and its wireless service would have to operate on T-Mobile's network, generating more revenue for T-Mobile. Dish said it plans to create a fully owned network, but building the infrastructure for it would be expensive, and Dish has been losing subscribers steadily to cheaper streaming services.

[T-Mobile and Sprint attacked each other for years before they decided to team up.] Mr. Legere made numerous visits to both the F.C.C. and the Justice Department, documenting his activity on social media. A month after the deal was announced, Mr. Claure was a host of a fund-raiser for Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican who was running for Senate. Ms. Blackburn, a longtime supporter of the telecommunications industry, was elected to the Senate in November. Several lawmakers expressed misgivings over Mr. Legere's Washington visits, noting the dozens of times that he and other T-Mobile executives have stayed at the Trump International Hotel there. The companies have denied doing anything inappropriate to curry favor with federal officials. If the deal is completed, it would be a victory for the billionaire entrepreneur Masayoshi Son, whose SoftBank investment group owns a controlling interest in Sprint, a company with debts of $40 billion. Mr. Son has been trying to unload the troubled carrier for years. In December 2016, Mr. Son met with Mr. Trump, who was then the president-elect, at Trump Tower and pledged to invest some $50 billion in the United States in an initiative that would create 50,000 jobs. In February, SoftBank executives held discussions in Washington with members of the president's economics team. The Justice Department's approval of the merger relies on the future actions of Dish, a company with a history of violations that is controlled by the billionaire Charles Ergen, an expert poker player and tough negotiator. Dish would face millions of dollars in fines if it failed to build out its cellular service, Mr. Delrahim said. In a statement on Friday, Dish said it would voluntarily pay a fine of up to $2.2 billion if it failed to deploy a 5G network covering at least 70 percent of the country's population in the next four years. The Justice Department and the F.C.C. will monitor Dish to ensure that it adheres to the agreement, amounting to what is known as a behavioral remedy under which federal regulators watch over a for-profit business. In assessing previous merger deals, Mr. Delrahim has criticized such arrangements. On Friday, he said the agencies' oversight of Dish did not amount to a behavioral remedy, largely because they will track Dish's initial build-out of a wireless network and then step away after it starts operating.","Critics, including a group of state attorneys general, continued to voice their objections to the deal, saying the combination would harm consumers.",4fed0ab6-6e86-5b11-8f28-de614003aa80,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/27/business/00sprint/00sprint-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=6fa2410daf67e9af62cb7ec87be1bb8e9c19219a064ce6cecb990fc76fad247f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Sprint store in Manhattan.

Theater,Rattlestick Theater Festival to Commemorate Stonewall Anniversary,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/15/theater/rattlestick-theater-festival-to-commemorate-stonewall-anniversary.html,"This summer, Rattlestick Playwrights Theater will join many other New York City cultural institutions in commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Stonewall uprising, which brought the fight for gay rights into public view in 1969. From June 20-24, the theater will present Pride Plays, a festival of readings that celebrate L.G.B.T.Q. voices, produced by Doug Nevin and the actor Michael Urie, and directed by Nick Mayo.

The festival will include plays in the queer theater canon alongside works from a new generation of artists. The lineup, which Mr. Nevin and Mr. Urie say is not yet complete, includes classics like William Hoffman's ""As Is,"" Chay Yew's ""A Language of Their Own"" and Jane Chambers's ""Last Summer at Bluefish Cove."" But the producers also plan to highlight work from emerging playwrights like MJ Kaufman and Daaimah Mubashshir, whose play ""Room Enough (For Us All)"" explores gay life and cultural identity for a young Muslim woman.

[Check out our Culture Calendar here.]

To ensure that the selection of playwrights and plays reflected diverse voices, the organizers put together an advisory committee that includes the playwrights Moises Kaufman, Lucy Thurber and Mr. Yew, who the producers say have encouraged them to listen to new voices.

""If you look back at all history it's generally been written by white men, and so much of the theater has been predominantly that,"" Mr. Urie said. ""We really wanted, as we look forward, to find plays that accurately represented the community, which is so vast.""","The Pride Plays festival will feature more than a dozen readings from plays by seminal L.G.B.T. writers, as well as by newcomers.",7788f44e-d914-5438-aa47-28e2528c735f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/15/arts/15rattlestick-still/15rattlestick-still-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2bd201e2ef5c5fea030eba7367b6ce80fc6e02fa0fb09f85741652352a728b94&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The actor Michael Urie is co-producing Pride Plays for Rattlestick Playwrights Theater with Doug Nevin.,7788f44e-d914-5438-aa47-28e2528c735f,N24News/imgs/7788f44e-d914-5438-aa47-28e2528c735f.jpg,10
Books,Mindy Kaling Doesn't Want Your Pity,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/06/books/review/mindy-kaling-nothing-like-i-imagined.html,"NOTHING LIKE I IMAGINED 

(Except for Sometimes) 

By Mindy Kaling 

Read by the author

You know those scenes in the TV show ""The Mindy Project"" where the narration is taken over by Mindy's inner thoughts, her real life becoming mere background noise to her analysis of it, or to her daydreams, so you feel as if you're viewing the world from the inside of her brain? This audiobook is a lot like that. Mindy Kaling's third collection, ""Nothing Like I Imagined"" (following ""Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me?"" and ""Why Not Me?""), compiles intimate reflections on what it is to be her -- with some advice you might apply to how to be you, too.

Since her last book, Kaling has become a mother, and parenthood is the anchor for her current preoccupations. In the first essay, ""Masala Mindy,"" she explains how having her daughter, Kit, made her rethink her ""kind of Hindu""-ness, both religiously and culturally. ""I had to grapple with questions I could ignore when it was just me,"" she says, ""like: How Indian do I want my daughter to be? Should I start being more Indian really quick, like right now, so I can trick her into believing this has always been my deal?"" She recalls how her Tamil father and Bengali mother, who met in Lagos, Nigeria, and raised her in Massachusetts, embarrassed her by buying fancy Cheddar instead of Kraft Singles when her white friends came over. Later, after Kit's Mundan (the Hindu ceremony that ""involves the act of shaving all the hair off a baby's head ... to rid you of the negativity from your past life""), Kaling places a Ziploc bag of her child's hair next to a photo of her late mother in her 20s, and sobs. ""It finally dawned on me,"" she says, her perennially upbeat pitch striking a sudden, rare note of pathos, unadulterated by humor: ""I have a child who will never know her grandmother, the person who was the closest to me in the world. And I was about to start this journey with my daughter by myself.""","In her new collection of personal essays, ""Nothing Like I Imagined,"" the actor and TV producer balances single parenthood with a singular career.",69bffe9a-37f7-51d2-ad8e-eb3b3c87f8d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/08/books/review/Christensen1/Christensen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=525&w=1003&s=13156123f1fc91af54cae681c13a04caae6163069da1c70d70e1d1eacb2fbdff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""If I had to choose between having boring sex with someone I love for 15 minutes before going to sleep or being on Instagram,"" Mindy Kaling says, ""I choose Instagram every time.""",69bffe9a-37f7-51d2-ad8e-eb3b3c87f8d1,N24News/imgs/69bffe9a-37f7-51d2-ad8e-eb3b3c87f8d1.jpg,13
Television,"The Best Movies and TV Shows New to Netflix, Amazon and Stan in Australia in August",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/arts/television/movie-tv-streaming-netflix-australia-august.html,"Every month, streaming services in Australia add a new batch of movies and TV shows to its library. Here are our picks for August. For the six-part docu-series ""Immigration Nation,"" the co-directors Christina Clusiau and Shaul Schwarz spent three years covering the tense situation on the U.S./Mexico border. Their crew was given unprecedented access to President Trump's Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, so much so that the administration has since become concerned that some of the footage in ""Immigration Nation"" may show ICE agents violating the law and misrepresenting their operations. A show that's this controversial before it debuts is certainly a must-see. With ""The Shining"" sequel ""Doctor Sleep,"" the writer-director Mike Flanagan delivers a Stephen King movie adaptation that feels a lot like reading one of King's novels. Flanagan uses his lengthy running time to develop the three main characters: the jaded alcoholic psychic Danny Torrance (Ewan McGregor), the parasitic immortal cult leader ""Rose the Hat"" (Rebecca Ferguson), and the supernaturally gifted teen Abra Stone (Kyliegh Curran). The inevitable clash between good and bad psychics lacks a little oomph (and feels derivative of ""The Shining"" movie), but for the most part this is a genuinely spooky and resonant film about old ghosts and stolen childhoods.

During these stressful times, we could all use a well-made, feather-light, agreeably silly dance movie. ""Work It"" could very well fit the bill. Produced by Alicia Keys, the film stars Sabrina Carpenter as a teenager who has to learn to dance -- and then work with a team of other misfits -- so she can compete in a big contest and enhance her college application. A cast of skilled dancers will get plenty of opportunities to strut their stuff, in a picture that combines underdog sports melodrama with high school romantic comedy. Amanda Peet gives one of the most riveting performance of this television year in the second season of the true-crime docudrama ""Dirty John,"" playing the infamous spurned wife and murderer Betty Broderick. Christian Slater plays Dan Broderick, who -- in the show's version of the story -- became a successful lawyer with Betty's support, then put her through a humiliating, dragged-out divorce so he could marry a younger woman. The series' creator Alexandra Cunningham retells a tale that was a tabloid staple in the 1990s, but puts her focus on the roles that gender and status played in this relationship's unbalanced power dynamic. Throughout, Peet embodies a dynamic woman who comes off as both scary and sympathetic.

The supernatural adventure series ""Lucifer"" has a lot in common with the excellent ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" spinoff ""Angel,"" in that both are imaginative and witty episodic dramas about demons who fight their own natures while solving crimes in Los Angeles. The ""Lucifer"" creators leaned into that similarity with their shocking season four finale, which saw Lucifer Morningstar (played by the charming Tom Ellis) re-embracing his dark destiny and reclaiming his throne in Hell. This situation surely won't last, but seeing how the devil himself returns to L.A. in season five should be a lot of fun. ""Shutter Island"" (August 1), ""Mundo Misterio"" (August 4), ""Sam Jay: 3 in the Morning"" (August 4), ""Anelka: L'Incompris"" (August 5), ""World's Most Wanted"" (August 5), ""The Rain"" Season 3 (August 6), ""Berlin, Berlin"" (August 7), ""High Seas"" Season 3 (August 7), ""Nailed It!

Widely considered one of the best Australian films of recent years, the drama ""Acute Misfortune"" -- directed by Thomas Wright, and co-written by Wright and Erik Jensen -- is based on Jensen's biography of the late Adam Cullen, a painter known for his bold colors, shocking subject matter and punk aesthetic. The movie is about the close and sometimes contentious relationship that developed between the green young journalist Wright and the cantankerous and sickly Cullen. It's a study in how difficult it can be to put artists and their work into context. The outstanding actress Juno Temple gets a much-deserved leading role in ""Little Birds,"" playing Lucy Savage, a rich New Yorker who explores the wide open sexual and political possibilities of Tangier in the mid 1950s. Loosely based on the work of the erotic fiction pioneer Anais Nin, this stylish six-part series -- directed by Stacie Passon -- spoofs the presumptions and privileges of the colonial class, while graphically depicting their secret desires. Temple brings a sense of playfulness and humor to a character on a wild journey of self-discovery. The TV writer-producer team of Robert and Michelle King -- best-known for creating ""The Good Wife"" and its spinoff ""The Good Fight"" -- go to some wonderfully odd places with their new series ""Evil."" Katja Herbers plays a psychologist who helps a deeply religious Catholic investigator (played by Mike Colter) and a skilled tinkerer (Aasif Mandvi) on a mission to determine if there are reasonable explanations for supernatural phenomena. Michael Emerson plays an antagonistic chaos-agent, working for his own mysterious ends. ""Evil"" is occasionally quite scary and often very funny. It's also consistently provocative in the way it depicts issues of faith and fervor.

One of the most artfully rendered romantic movies of recent years, ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire"" is set on an island estate in late 18th century Brittany, where a painter named Marianne (Noemie Merlant) has been hired to produce a portrait of a moody aristocrat named Heloise (Adele Haenel). The two fall in love and take their time, savoring the days they spend together before Heloise's impending marriage. The writer-director Celine Sciamma captures the passion of these two women, as they enjoy the fleeting freedom of a secret affair. Named for Helen Reddy's 1972 feminist anthem, ""I Am Woman"" tells the story of the Melbourne-born singer and her rise to international pop music stardom. Tilda Cobham-Hervey plays Reddy, who arrives in the United States as an unknown and has to struggle against the ingrained sexism and shortsightedness of 1960s American showbiz to get her voice heard. Danielle Macdonald plays Lillian Roxon, the Australian rock journalist whose enthusiasm for the women's movement helped inspire Reddy's most enduring hit. Fans of ""strange but true"" crime stories should enjoy ""Love Fraud,"" a docu-series about a con-man who drained the bank accounts of several trusting women -- until they found each other online and worked together to expose him. The co-directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady (best-known for the documentary ""Jesus Camp"") get to know these ladies, who for the most part don't seem like easy or even lucrative marks. ""Love Fraud"" is about predators who use the internet to find not necessarily the wealthiest prey, but the most persuadable. Also arriving: ""The Deceived"" (August 4), ""Magic Mike"" (August 5), ""Stroszek"" (August 5), ""Mr. & Mrs. Murder"" (August 6), ""Brabham"" (August 7), ""Chimerica"" Season 1 (August 7), ""Michelle Obama: Life After the White House"" (August 11), ""Battlestar Galactica"" Seasons 1-4 (August 14), ""The Circus"" (August 17), ""Dark Money"" Season 1 (August 23), ""Blood & Treasure"" Season 1 (August 27).

A different kind of food show -- or perhaps a different kind of political panel show -- ""Pan y Circo"" is hosted by the actor Diego Luna, who brings together an assortment of activists and celebrities for a series of fabulous meals, across Mexico. The guests have spirited debates about everything from immigration law to the drug war to gender politics, all in a spirit of honesty and good will. There's even a quarantine special, with Luna's pals gathering virtually, to talk about life in the COVID-19 era. The reality television producer Mark Burnett launched his career in the mid-1990s with ""Eco-Challenge,"" an extreme team race across the wilderness, combining multiple disciplines. Burnett set the concept aside after he found greater success with shows like ""Survivor"" and ""The Apprentice,"" but now he's bringing it back as ""World's Toughest Race: Eco-Challenge Fiji."" The ruggedly outdoorsy TV personality Bear Grylls hosts the ten-part series, which covers a grueling, nonstop 11-day scramble across mountains and water, with 66 teams -- a total of over 300 athletes -- pushing the limits of their endurance.","Our picks for August, including 'Project Power,' 'Doctor Sleep' and 'Portrait of a Lady on Fire.'",7d8fdc8e-35aa-5f3e-97ae-2cc7060d9955,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/01/world/01oz-watch-1/01oz-watch-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c544591f031c4a35fe35981cdea3fa46ed04d348b6388cbfa9ed3683ee8b4dd4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"'Doctor Sleep""",7d8fdc8e-35aa-5f3e-97ae-2cc7060d9955,N24News/imgs/7d8fdc8e-35aa-5f3e-97ae-2cc7060d9955.jpg,3

Books,"Tempting Fate With a Season of Romance, Sex, Art and Destiny",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/books/review/madame-nielsen-the-endless-summer.html,"SOME NOVELS are dense as lead, their every line, character and event heavy with import. Others belie their weighty payloads with a veil-like fluttering, shunning complex characters and precise details in favor of less fixable quantities like mood, movement and texture. The Danish author 's debut in English translation, ""The Endless Summer,"" is very much in the latter category, telling the story of a family that indulges in life's lightness, ultimately paying the price for ignoring the weight of being.

Nielsen is many things -- a musician, actor, playwright and performance artist who has journeyed to Iran and who walked with refugees all the way from the Balkans to Denmark. But she is probably best known for declaring her birth-identity, Claus Beck-Nielsen, dead in 2001 and producing work under a series of names that culminated in """" in 2014. This change involved a switch from male to female dress and gender pronouns, although readers coming to ""The Endless Summer"" expecting a dissection of transgender themes will be disappointed. This is not a criticism of the novel -- clearly Nielsen has no intention of foregrounding gender in this particular work. It's a reminder that in an era profuse with identity politics, authors like Nielsen will remain interested in many different things.

If gender is mainly absent from ""The Endless Summer,"" the questions that do occupy it include vagabondage, romanticism, sexuality, art and what the author calls ""life's unfurling as destiny and tale."" The book begins with a Danish patriarch who comes into a large inheritance and moves his wife, stepdaughter and four sons into an enormous estate. He unfortunately then falls into a depression when he is overcome by both his wife's infidelity and the upkeep on the new property (which is far beyond his capacities or income). So he disappears into the night.","Madame Nielsen's ""The Endless Summer"" — a novel combining nostalgia, reverie and tragedy — is about a family who decides to live it up.",e823a4cd-4f27-552b-a71b-f53ba77d27cf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/11/books/review/11Esposito/11Esposito-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=b54003d67103af5f77aef699bbd8d91fc7c260c8a77b8876b4e03356efeceb5e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Madame Nielsen,e823a4cd-4f27-552b-a71b-f53ba77d27cf,N24News/imgs/e823a4cd-4f27-552b-a71b-f53ba77d27cf.jpg,13
Art & Design,Steaks Grown From Human Cells Spark Interest and Outrage,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/arts/design/Ouroboros-Steak-design-museum.html,"The installation of steak grown from human cells at the Design Museum in London was intended to criticize the meat industry's rising use of living cells from animals. It ended up triggering a roiling debate about bioethics and the pitfalls of artistic critique. Orkan Telhan, an artist and associate professor of fine arts at the Stuart Weitzman School of Design at the University of Pennsylvania, spent the last year imagining how climate change might impact the future of food consumption. He collaborated with scientists to create a project that included 3-D printed pancakes, bioengineered bread and genetically-modified salmon. But it was their provocative, and less appetizing, development of what they call ""Ouroboros Steak,"" meat cultivated from human cells and expired blood, that challenged the sustainability practices of the nascent cellular agriculture industry, which develops lab-grown products from existing cell cultures. After the Ouroboros Steak traveled to the Design Museum in October, an intense online debate grew over the project's motivations, and the artist received dozens of threatening emails and social media posts calling him ""wicked"" and ""pure evil."" Some messages have demanded the destruction of the artwork. According to Mr. Telhan, who provided the emails and tweets to a reporter, ""the focus quickly became centered on accusations that we were promoting cannibalism.""

Named after the ancient symbol of a snake eating its own tail, ""Ouroboros Steak"" examines, but does not promote, auto-cannibalism as a satirical take on the increasing demand for meat products around the world, which scientists have warned will likely contribute to carbon emissions and reduced biodiversity. The designers hoped that shocking audiences with the suggestion would trigger an examination of environmental responsibility and the clean-meat industry, which has promoted itself as producing ""kill-free"" food, although most companies heavily rely on fetal bovine serum harvested during the slaughter of pregnant cows for cell cultivation. ""Our project provides an absurd solution to a serious problem,"" said Andrew Pelling, a biophysicist who partnered with Mr. Telhan and the industrial designer Grace Knight to create the steaks. ""But in our scenario, you are at least giving consent by taking your own cells. In the world of lab-grown meats, you are taking cells from animals without their consent."" As controversial as the project has become, the bite-size chunks of meat toured museums around the United States last year without a problem -- even when cheekily displayed on a dish with silverware.

""I called it a sleeper hit,"" said Michelle Millar Fisher, the curator who commissioned the steaks for the exhibition, ""Designs for Different Futures,"" which began at the Philadelphia Museum of Art and traveled to the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. ""The provocation at the heart of this project is really fair. It's important to ask ourselves where we get our proteins."" There are no plans to remove the installation from the Design Museum before the exhibition ends in March 2021, although Ms. Fisher and Mr. Telhan will address the criticism of ""Ouroboros Steak"" in an upcoming online conversation. Priya Khanchandani, head of curatorial at the Design Museum, has also defended the project, calling it ""the equivalent of a design dystopia."" ""It is asking a controversial question that in an epoch of severely depleted resources badly needs to be articulated,"" she added. Investment in cellular agriculture has increased at a remarkable pace over the last few years, even as serious discussions around the bioethics of lab-grown meat have taken a back seat. Market researchers estimate that the cultured meat business could reach $214 million by 2025, and more than double to $593 million by 2032. Earlier this year, the National Science Foundation Growing Convergence program awarded the University of California, Davis, a $3.5 million grant for cell-based, lab-grown meat research. And on Dec. 2, Singapore became the first government to approve the consumption of chicken cells grown in bioreactors, telling the San Francisco-based company Eat Just that it could sell its bioengineered chicken nuggets. ""We need productive critique if we are ushering in a new technology,"" said Isha Datar, executive director of New Harvest, a nonprofit research institute focused on accelerating breakthroughs in cellular agriculture. ""This technology holds the promise to create a more sustainable means of meat production, but how do we hold ourselves accountable to ensuring that happens?"" In recent decades, several artists have questioned the ethics of biotechnology by adopting the field's methods and machinery. The Brazilian artist Eduardo Kac worked with a team of geneticists in 2002 to splice an albino rabbit's DNA with that of a luminescent jellyfish to call attention to what the transgenic crossing of species' characteristics might imply for the human genome. In 2019, the artist Jordan Eagles projected magnified images of blood onto the gallery walls of the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh as commentary on the stigma associated with L.G.B.T.Q. blood donations and those living with H.I.V./AIDS.",An artist project offering an absurdist take on the lab-grown meat industry triggers a debate and backlash in London.,465bd490-5646-56c2-9baf-ebdb13d402f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/08/arts/07STEAK-ART1/merlin_180722835_e4c4aa7d-eef1-4734-802f-fe5e292147ff-facebookJumbo.jpg,"&ldquo;Ouroboros Steak&rdquo; (2019), vitamin-like discs produced from human cells, designed by Andrew Pelling, Grace Knight and Orkan Telhan, at the Philadelphia Museum of Art last year.",465bd490-5646-56c2-9baf-ebdb13d402f0,N24News/imgs/465bd490-5646-56c2-9baf-ebdb13d402f0.jpg,14

I first met Devon when I went into Jeffrey New York and he helped me. That was about 10 years ago. When he went off to do his own thing, I followed him. He gets me and my style -- more current than classic or traditional -- and he does a great job on the fittings. Almost all of my suits are very tailored. My favorite one feels really good. It's a soft cotton blend, but it's a winter suit that's not too heavy. It's a two-button navy suit with thin pinstripes, but then there's a cranberry red lining. I always get compliments.

Jeans I have a lot of jeans, but currently my favorite is a pair of Frame jeans that are slim but you still have room to move. They're black. I'm a lifelong New Yorker, what can I say.

Shoe I've been a complete sneakerhead pretty much my whole life. I wouldn't say I'm a collector, but I probably have over 100 pairs. I have Air Force 1s, Flyknits, Lanvin, Adidas -- so many. My favorites are a pair of black high-tops with silver accents from Saint Laurent. I'll wear them with jeans, suits, pants, all of the above. My twin daughters also got me a Nike gift card for Father's Day to customize my own pair, so we did it together online. It's funky. As you'd expect from 10-year-olds, the colors are pretty bright. There's red, black, some silver and a little white. And they're camo. I also have their names added on each foot, so when I'm not with them they're still with me.

Watch I got myself a gift about four years ago: It's an Audemars Piguet watch with a blue face and blue band, but it's a rubber band. I don't love big bulky chain links.

And it's sporty.","The fitness company leader likes James Perse shirts, suits by Devon Scott and an Audemars Piguet watch.",2ebf4341-968d-5b08-b713-ceca737102a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/13/fashion/13LIST1/13LIST1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=1624f101cd55233d4893afdb68fa4ae70f6aa1ea24fed6cde2fd291290dfba48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Harvey Spevak in New York.,2ebf4341-968d-5b08-b713-ceca737102a9,N24News/imgs/2ebf4341-968d-5b08-b713-ceca737102a9.jpg,19
Health,Older Adults Are Still Skipping Vaccinations,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/health/shingles-vaccine.html,"Louise Abate first noticed an itchy tingle near her hairline. The pain started a day or two later as a blistering rash swept down from her scalp onto her forehead. ""My eye was so swollen I couldn't open it,"" she said. Shingles. Ms. Abate, 76, a retired casino supervisor in Rio Rancho, N.M., had had the disease twice before, in her 60s, but the episode three years ago hit particularly hard. Long after the rash healed, which took about three weeks, she suffered the complication called postherpetic neuralgia -- lingering nerve pain that can last for months or even, as in her case, years. ""I get up every day, and it's there,"" she said. ""I go to sleep, and it's there."" She had heard something about a shingles vaccine, but ""I really didn't pay attention,"" Ms. Abate confessed. And she is hardly unusual.

And elders have been particularly slow to take advantage of the shingles vaccine. The Food and Drug Administration approved it a decade ago, and the C.D.C. recommends it for those over 60, including those who've already had shingles. Coverage has climbed steadily, but in 2014 it had still reached only 31 percent of those over 65. As with nearly all of these vaccines, older whites were more likely to have been vaccinated than blacks, Hispanics or Asians. ""Vaccines are less likely to be routinely incorporated in adult medical practice,"" Dr. Bridges said. ""Every time a child comes in, a pediatrician makes sure they're up-to-date."" Older adults often have medical issues that take precedence during brief office visits. They also see specialists who are more focused on cardiology or oncology than on flu and shingles. Seniors and their caregivers should request vaccinations; the C.D.C. publishes guidelines and a quiz that explain which ones are recommended. Zostavax, the current shingles vaccine, reduces the risk of the disease in adults over 60 by half, and the incidence of postherpetic neuralgia by two-thirds. The vaccine's underuse can be blamed, in part, on supply shortages in its early years until about 2012. The manufacturer, Merck, and the C.D.C. didn't increase media campaigns until vaccine supplies were sufficient; such campaigns had just started when Ms. Abate became ill. It's not surprising that she was only vaguely aware of Zostavax.

Cost remains a barrier to getting Zostavax and some other adult vaccines. In a study published this past summer, researchers reported that nearly 40 percent of the time, patients over 50 who requested a prescription for Zostavax at a pharmacy chain chose not to receive the vaccine; out-of-pocket costs were most frequently the reason. The Affordable Care Act requires private insurers to cover Zostavax without co-pays for people older than 60, and many cover it for policyholders over 50. But Medicare beneficiaries find that, unlike the flu and pneumococcal vaccines, which are covered under Part B and often administered in physicians' offices, Zostavax and Tdap are covered under Part D. Physicians can't easily bill for Part D reimbursement, so they often send patients to pharmacies, which can. But because Part D involves a welter of different plans and formularies, some requiring patients to pay for the vaccine and then seek reimbursement, the cost and co-pays can discourage use. Zostavax, at about $200 a dose, is the most expensive adult vaccine. This landscape could change drastically in a year or so. In October, the pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline submitted a new shingles vaccine for F.D.A. approval. International studies indicate that the newcomer, Shingrix, is far more effective than the current vaccine, reducing the incidence of shingles by 90 percent. Moreover, the effectiveness doesn't appear to decrease among older age groups, as Zostavax's does. Shingrix has its own drawbacks. For one, it requires a second injected dose several months after the first; some people won't follow up. The manufacturer has yet to set a price, and unless Congress changes the law, any new vaccine will face the same Part D billing complications.",People once vigilant about immunizing their children aren't nearly as careful about protecting themselves as they age.,92cdc2b0-4c2c-5df3-8ef4-093bf79ecaeb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/03/science/06SPAN/06SPAN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=140fc3c5add68fe51e9f1abfedc3fce27161222a6aaffadc5420c8a78eaed589&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Louise Abate at home in Rio Rancho, N.M.",92cdc2b0-4c2c-5df3-8ef4-093bf79ecaeb,N24News/imgs/92cdc2b0-4c2c-5df3-8ef4-093bf79ecaeb.jpg,1
Opinion,Why Young Latinx Voters Rallied Behind Sanders,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/opinion/bernie-sanders-latinx-vote.html,"Bernie Sanders's message has resonated among young people, particularly younger Latinx voters. In California, where they make up about a third of the constituency, Latinx voters under 30 overwhelmingly supported Mr. Sanders. That electorate helped his campaign carry enough delegates in California and Texas to keep the nomination contest within 100 delegates after the Super Tuesday contests. Though he didn't win Michigan, they also backed him there. So why are young Latinx voters rallying behind Mr. Sanders?

The answer is not very complicated: His campaign organized and prioritized outreach to Latinx communities.

In the past, the Democratic Party believed immigration to be the central issue that mobilized Latinx voters. And yet, a poll conducted in March by Univision and the Latino Community Foundation found that like most Americans, Latinx voters in California considered health care and the economy to be top policy issues. While Mr. Sanders has a comprehensive and progressive immigration plan, he has not made it the focal point of his campaign. Instead he has centered his debates and messaging on issues like health care, the economy and jobs.

Campaigns that have historically tried to target Latinx voters have usually relied on Spanish-language media, including some comically translated campaign websites. But audiences are usually older and nonvoters. The Latinx population in the United States is characterized by its youth -- 30 years old on average. The Sanders campaign has figured out that to mobilize a mass of Latinx voters, they needed to target the youth. Older Latinx voters may come along anyway after their children persuade them -- there is empirical research that Latinx youth often serve as ""news interpreters"" and information brokers for their parents.",The answer is not very complicated.,11cab243-f3ab-5ad3-bc41-a37cbe9df4a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/opinion/13soto-vazquez-1/13soto-vazquez-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f0590c1213f97d642e9946a9473232fc3542d4cde316dae0d6a1871659039883&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rally for Senator Bernie Sanders  in Mesquite, Texas, in February.",11cab243-f3ab-5ad3-bc41-a37cbe9df4a9,N24News/imgs/11cab243-f3ab-5ad3-bc41-a37cbe9df4a9.jpg,11

Technology,"Sorry, Power-Lunchers. This Restaurant Is a Co-Working Space Now.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/08/technology/restaurants-co-working-areas.html,"Credit...Sam Hodgson for The New York Times





SAN FRANCISCO -- The bar at the Elite Cafe here was packed, but not a drink was being poured. The champagne stand sat empty and warm. The tap was covered in plastic wrap. Instead, the restaurant was flooded with the low din of typing. That's because the Elite Cafe, from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. every weekday, is not exactly a restaurant anymore and certainly not a bar. It is a co-working space. Everything is now a co-working space, one of those shared offices that are popular among freelancers, small companies and other workers who want a change of scenery. Coffee shops are co-working spaces. Gyms are co-working spaces. Social clubs are co-working spaces. And now restaurants -- but only before dinnertime. The company that laid the extension cords and power strips across Elite Cafe's copper tables is called Spacious. Since it was started two years ago, Spacious has converted 25 upscale restaurants in New York and San Francisco into weekday work spaces. Membership, which allows entry into any location, is $99 a month for a year, or $129 by the month. With $9 million in venture capital it received in May, Spacious plans to expand this year to up to 100 spaces.

A restaurant makes for the perfect conversion, the Spacious team argues. Bars become standing desks. Booths become conference rooms. The lighting tends to be nicer, less harsh and fluorescent, than an office, and the music makes for a nice ambience. Originally, the founders of Spacious thought they would have to sell restaurateurs on the idea. Instead, restaurants, struggling to pay rent and wages and frustrated with disappointing lunch traffic, are coming to them, eager to strike deals for a slice of the membership dues. Only 5 percent have made the cut to become Spacious spaces, said the company, which is unprofitable.

Spacious is part of a broader debate over how to use spaces in cities as people increasingly buy items online instead of in stores and as labor costs make restaurants an even more challenging proposition. A membership model is the future for bricks-and-mortar spots, according to the Spacious team, and restaurants are the easiest first step. ""Actively consuming isn't what we want to do with the space in our neighborhoods anymore,"" said Chris Smothers, 30, a Spacious co-founder and its chief technology officer. ""Retail spaces are designed for you to come in, make a transaction and get out, and that's why you feel weird in a coffee shop all day, because all of these spaces are designed for you to leave.""

The zoning implications of what Spacious is doing are unclear. Can a restaurant just become an office during the day? ""Somebody would have to make the case that we are an office -- and I think that's a pretty heavy burden of proof,"" said Preston Pesek, 39, a co-founder and the chief executive of Spacious, who previously worked in commercial real estate investing. ""What really is the definition of an office? A business conversation can happen anywhere. A phone is a computer."" He is hoping some linguistic adjustments help. ""We're trying not to use the word co-working because of some of the zoning issues,"" Mr. Pesek said. ""We prefer the term drop-in work space."" Andrew Rudansky, a spokesman for New York City's Department of Buildings, said the use of restaurants as co-working spaces was permitted as long as the businesses primarily operated as restaurants. The department would investigate any complaints that they were no longer mainly eating and drinking establishments, he said. San Francisco's Planning Department did not return requests for comment. The first Spacious, in 2016, was the hip bistro DBGB Kitchen and Bar in New York, which closed last year. The restaurant's management had set the tables for dinner each night before closing, and all day the tables had sat fully ready. Members of the Spacious team asked to be trained in how to lay the tables -- they would do it themselves after their co-working clients were done.

""I'm into raja yoga, and Preston's into ashtanga, and a friend said, 'You guys are both into real estate,'"" Mr. Smothers said. They met their chief operating officer, Jaclyn Pascocello, who was a general manager at the Hillstone Restaurant Group, after she heard about the project through mutual friends while on a yoga retreat in Puerto Rico. Their first plan was to use hotel rooms while the occupants were out for the day. They designed convertible furniture to hide the hotel bed and made plans for a concept building. Then they realized there was a simpler space to manage: restaurants. Ms. Pascocello, 30, argues that the trick to making a better co-working space is to run it as if it were a restaurant. ""We take guest notes,"" she said. ""The goal is to know everyone's name, know what they're working on, know if they're sensitive to noise, how they like coffee, the milk options."" Restaurateurs said that as many of their colleagues faced financial struggles, there was less stigma around sharing their space. They give Spacious a set of keys, and the start-up opens it in the morning, brews coffee and has its own staff host at the door. Justin Sievers, 34, the managing partner of Bar Primi in Lower Manhattan, saw Spacious operating at a restaurant nearby. With lunch traffic low, he said, he decided to be ""inventive"" and reached out to the start-up to make Bar Primi a co-working space during the day.

""Laptops used to send the message that we're failing as a restaurant,"" he said. ""But that's changing."" Some Spacious locations have become almost neighborhood living rooms. Samantha Moretti, managing partner at the Milling Room on New York's Upper West Side, was surprised to find people knitting and holding after-school homework sessions when she went in before opening for dinner. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Smothers and Ms. Pascocello visited Crave Fishbar in Midtown East, which is a Spacious space during the day. Crave's host that day was Dave Wilson, 25, who was a bartender before managing this brood of pop-up office workers. ""They're more low maintenance,"" he said of his new customers. Around 4 p.m., restaurant staff arrive to set up the dining room. A text goes out announcing last call for coffee and that the power cords are being pulled up. There's no branding aside from a sandwich board on the sidewalk. One-third of the members join Spacious after just wandering by one. The founders want the space to look like the restaurant and for no two spaces to have anything in common except one thing. ""The coffee is always to the left of the water,"" Ms. Pascocello said. ""If you walk in and it's to the right, we've failed.""

Back at the Elite Cafe in San Francisco, the workday was in full swing. ""In cafes, you can't have a computer and sit there for eight hours,"" said Tanya Cheng, 39, who works in e-commerce and had a laptop, a keyboard, a mouse and a tablet set up. She works in Spacious spaces every day and said they had changed her relationship to the restaurants. ""When I go to dinner, I avoid these places now,"" Ms. Cheng said, with a laugh. ""It's work for me."" Jeff Bernstein, a venture and capital markets adviser, said the setup was more inherently social than a co-working office. At least once a week, he stays after the workday and has drinks with someone from the space. ""You can get immersed in your stuff, or you can notice somebody doing something interesting three stools away and you can chat with them,"" he said. ""Because you're at a bar."" In a nearby booth were Justin Morgan, 38, an information technology director at the cannabis company Sparc, who sat across from his partner, James Landau, 40, a product manager. Both said they liked that Spacious was not a traditional co-working space, like a WeWork, which costs significantly more and has perks including beer, table tennis, evening socials and (for a little extra) summer camp. ""Have you ever worked from home five days a week straight?"" Mr. Morgan asked. ""It's terrible."" An older man in a suit came into Elite Cafe and asked to be seated. The host told him that it was closed for diners right now and was a co-working space. He looked at the full restaurant, a little confused, and turned around. A minute later, a young couple entered with a stroller and shopping bags and requested the menu. There was no lunch, the host explained again. Just co-working.","Everything, it seems, is a shared office these days, including upscale dining rooms before they open for the evening.

Fashion & Style,It Was Love at First Follow,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/weddings/it-was-love-at-first-follow.html,"Dr. Sharath Puttichanda was an emergency-medicine psychiatrist at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence in December 2019 when he stumbled across Sundeep Dosanjh's Instagram posts from Machu Picchu. A neighbor was off on an adventure in Peru while he was stuck home in wintry New England, Dr. Puttichanda (left) said, so he began wandering on the internet. ""I was jealous,"" he said. Mr. Dosanjh's Instagram posts were loaded with hashtags that included #gayindian. There he found more than just vicarious travel adventures. ""He had this beautiful post about his coming-out story,"" said Dr. Puttichanda, 38 and the assistant director for psychiatric emergency services at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. ""I read that and I remember telling two of my best friends, 'There's this guy, and he had this beautiful story, and there's something so familiar about him that I feel the need to reach out.'""

He didn't. Instead, he began following Mr. Dosanjh, 36, on Instagram. So a few weeks later, when Mr. Dosanjh posted a story about a Lyft driver's off-handed, offensive remark about his ethnicity, Dr. Puttichanda posted a fiery comment noting that he also had had similar experiences. ""I responded, then looked at his pictures,"" said Mr. Dosanjh, a web and communications specialist for the school district in Elk Grove, Calif. ""He's cute, and I followed him back, and we started bantering."" Dr. Puttichanda had a break coming up, and Mr. Dosanjh suggested that he take a red-eye to San Francisco, so that the two might meet. But Dr. Puttichanda had tickets to a Broadway show, so, instead, he all but brought Mr. Dosanjh along on his trip to New York, via FaceTime. He narrated every event, and the two were still on FaceTime together until both fell asleep.

""I said, 'I don't know what's going on between you and I, but I have to let you know that I can't leave Northern California,'"" he said. ""He was like, 'OK. I have nothing holding me back.' And my heart literally melted."" The first actual meeting between the two was still more than a month in their future. With 3,000 miles separating them, they had to be creative about ""dates."" For their first, each went to a local P.F. Chang's, and fired up FaceTime to experience dinner almost as if they were in the same place. ""We had first-date conversation, looked at the menu together, everything you would do on a real in-person date,"" Mr. Dosanjh said. ""We had to think out every single detail to make it work."" They had a second virtual date at the Cheesecake Factory shortly afterward. Mr. Dosanjh sent flowers to Dr. Puttichanda for Valentine's Day. At the end of February, Dr. Puttichanda flew to San Francisco for an 11-day holiday, and Mr. Dosanjh surprised him at the baggage carousel.

Books,Pablo Neruda Saved Thousands of War Refugees. Isabel Allende Imagines Two of Them.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/books/review/a-long-petal-of-the-sea-isabel-allende.html,"In January of 1939, after three and a half years of devastating civil war, Francisco Franco defeated Spain's Republican army at Barcelona, clinching a dictatorship that would last for nearly a half-century and displacing hundreds of thousands of soldiers, activists and Republican supporters. Many fled across the Pyrenees into France thinking they'd escaped the worst, only to find themselves behind barbed wire in concentration camps like Argeles-sur-Mer, ""half-dead from cold and hunger.""

Though the larger world seemed as blind to Spain's displaced population as they'd been to the war itself, the Chilean diplomat and poet Pablo Neruda lobbied to save over 2,000 of the refugees, as many as could fit on a nine-ton cargo ship called the Winnipeg, bound for political asylum. Neruda's far-reaching humanist act calls to mind Oskar Schindler, and is the little-known kernel of history at the heart of Isabel Allende's 17th novel, ""A Long Petal of the Sea."" Allende, we learn from her author's note, first heard about Neruda's ""ship of hope"" in her childhood, when it caught in her memory and remained there for 40 years. Now she has deftly woven fact and fiction, history and memory, to create one of the most richly imagined portrayals of the Spanish Civil War to date, and one of the strongest and most affecting works in her long career.

Spanning generations and continents, the novel follows an unforgettable pair of exiles granted passage on the Winnipeg: Victor Dalmau, an auxiliary medic in the war, and Roser Bruguera, a young woman carrying the child of Victor's brother Guillem, missing in action. As the special consul for Spanish emigration, Neruda has been ordered to select candidates clinically, rejecting radicals and any candidates who are overly political or intellectual. His compassion becomes the stronger factor, however, an unexpected blessing for Victor and Roser, who manage to impress the poet with their selflessness and commitment to save the child at any cost.

[ Read an excerpt from ""A Long Petal of the Sea."" ]

Victor and Roser marry, a bond that has nothing to do with romantic love, but something far richer and more reliable. As they begin their lives over again with nothing in Santiago, Chile, their partnership grows into deep friendship and emotional symbiosis. Only together, they realize, can they endure what they've lost and recover a sense of purpose.","Based on true events around the Spanish Civil War, Allende's novel ""A Long Petal of the Sea"" explores the lives of exiles.",2322cdb9-67ed-57e8-9de7-29fc61a14371,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/16/books/review/16McLain1/McLain1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=75921a901a8ca158d2aaa4739ff84661e47f8621f5d3a6580aba45af03701849&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Isabel Allende's ""A Long Petal of the Sea"" is infused with Pablo Neruda's poetry.",2322cdb9-67ed-57e8-9de7-29fc61a14371,N24News/imgs/2322cdb9-67ed-57e8-9de7-29fc61a14371.jpg,13
Media,Planned Parenthood Turns to Tumblr to Reach a Younger Audience,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/25/business/media/planned-parenthood-turns-to-tumblr-to-reach-a-younger-audience.html,"As it undertakes an ad campaign in celebration of its 100th anniversary, Planned Parenthood of New York City is trying to reach a younger generation with a message about sexual and reproductive health. That message does not shy away from what one expert in nonprofit marketing called ""the elephant in the room"" -- abortion. To connect with those who were born after Roe v. Wade, the organization and its advertising agency, Kraftworks, turned to the microblogging social network Tumblr. ""We really are doing this partially to get a younger audience engaged in supporting Planned Parenthood,"" said Neil Kraft, the chief executive of Kraftworks. ""They do, to some extent, take it for granted."" The campaign, called Care That Counts, features stories of patients, staff members and volunteers told through text, photos and video to create what Carrie Mumah, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, characterized as a series of vignettes done in the style of the popular photography blog Humans of New York.

""We've done the campaign in a friendly, approachable way,"" Mr. Kraft said, with the intention -- and the hope -- that the frank, first-person tone will alleviate some of the stigma around talking about abortion. Using Tumblr is a smart move, said Bonnie McEwan, a nonprofit communications consultant who worked for Planned Parenthood's national office for two years beginning in 1998. ""You can target people so much more finely now, particularly with a cause like Planned Parenthood,"" she said. While the Tumblr stories cover topics like birth control, cancer screenings, gynecological exams and testing for sexually transmitted diseases, the campaign's inaugural story, posted on July 9, featured a patient who went to Planned Parenthood for an abortion after her birth control failed. ""We really never want to diminish the fact that we provide abortions,"" said Adrienne Verrilli, associate vice president for communications at Planned Parenthood of New York. ""It's really important to us to elevate the stories of real people who are accessing our abortion services."" Starting the conversation has already increased the number of patients who want to share their own stories through the Tumblr campaign, she said.

She and Mr. Kraft acknowledged that a strategy reliant on people willing to put their faces and first names on abortion narratives might not play as well in other parts of the country. ""In the depths of the red states, I'm not sure how well it would be received,"" Ms. Verrilli said, although she added that Planned Parenthood's national office was ""incredibly supportive"" of the Care That Counts campaign.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. The other inherent drawback in social media marketing is losing control of the conversation, especially with a polarizing topic like abortion. But the campaign's creators said they felt that was a risk worth taking. ""There are haters everywhere, and Planned Parenthood is clearly a hot-button topic,"" Mr. Kraft said. ""We're opening it up to that, but everything gets opened up to that."" One story is being posted to Tumblr each day for the 100 days leading up to the organization's anniversary on Oct. 16. Roughly two weeks into the campaign, Ms. Mumah said it had reached more than 100,000 people on social media. The posts had garnered more than 5,000 likes, shares and comments, which she said made the campaign the organization's most successful foray into digital marketing to date.

""I'm wondering if the social climate has emboldened women, particularly younger ones,"" Ms. McEwan said, pointing to current events like the legalization of same-sex marriage and Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. ""There's a real changing of the guard here of young people willing to tell their stories,"" Ms. Verrilli said. ""Young women are taking the issue of abortion back, and really owning it and advocating for it."" This kind of approach might not be as effective with conventional marketing channels, communications experts say. ""Doing this on social media is the perfect platform for this kind of campaign because it's very human. It puts a face on it,"" said Barbara Cave Henricks, president and chief executive of Cave Henricks Communications. ""That's why people go to social media, for a story."" As for the topic of abortion, avoiding it would be a mistake, Ms. McEwan said. Planned Parenthood has been so closely associated with abortion for so long that the appearance of dodging the issue would be demoralizing for the staff, donors and advocates -- and would be unlikely to quell the controversy the organization already faces. ""Planned Parenthood has always relied on its staff and clients and volunteers to carry the message,"" Ms. McEwan said. ""There's going to be controversy no matter what around these topics. They don't want to appear to be avoiding the question."" ""We know a lot about controversy, and we've been out on social for many years,"" she said, adding that the group had no intention of downplaying its role as an abortion provider. ""We're proud of our work.""","In a departure from traditional marketing, the organization's 100th anniversary ad campaign features personal stories of patients, staff and volunteers.",f48ceb3c-090c-5920-bfef-973651ea97b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/25/business/25ADCO1/25ADCO1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=457&w=873&s=f462101f2abfe25c0a8fe4913c03d6fc955821fbe4df8194bb794acba6c97fca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Planned Parenthood of New York's campaign is intended to help alleviate some of the stigma that surrounds talking about abortion.,f48ceb3c-090c-5920-bfef-973651ea97b9,N24News/imgs/f48ceb3c-090c-5920-bfef-973651ea97b9.jpg,16

There, I discovered Acne -- which is the weirdest name for a company and it's something I've been fighting all my life -- and their jeans fit skinny people really well.

Jacket I have a John Varvatos jacket in brown leather. It's nice on a windy day; it's nice for a dress-up; it's nice for a dress-down. This was given to me as a birthday present. Honestly, I don't shop much. I've stolen a lot from movie sets and I've tried taking pieces from photo shoots, but they watch them closely.

Shoes When it comes to shoes, it's pretty much just boots. I have one pair of black Chelsea boots with a zipper by AllSaints that I've had for two years. I was walking in Norway and I had these huge holes in these boots, but I couldn't let the boots go. They're like a family member. I've tried to replace them, but they don't make them anymore. So I feel like I'm doing Tinder for boots. I'm swiping whichever way is bad and not finding love. I'm just sleeping around with different boots. Right now, I'm wearing a pair of boots for Frye, but I feel sorry for them because they're just a weak comparison.

Opinion,Gretchen Whitmer: What if Trump Made Everyone Wear Masks?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/opinion/gretchen-whitmer-trump-coronavirus-masks.html,"LANSING, Mich. -- My state was hit hard by Covid-19. For many weeks, we had the nation's third-highest number of deaths despite having only the 10th-largest population. As a result, we took some of the most aggressive measures in the country in the fight against the disease, and our hard work paid off. Our actions saved thousands of lives. We are now working around the clock to restart our economy in a way that protects workers, businesses and families. But as people in Michigan and across the country begin to return to work, cases are rising again. To slow the rise and further protect our families from this virus, we need the Trump administration to issue a federal mask mandate. When more Americans wear a mask in public, we can save lives and put ourselves in a better position to send our children back to school in the fall. Governors of both parties in at least half of the states have issued mask orders to protect their residents. Kay Ivey in Alabama just required everyone to wear a mask in indoor spaces open to the public and outdoor public spaces where 10 or more people are gathered. In Michigan, I issued a similar order that also requires any business that is open to the public to deny entry to people who refuse to wear a face covering, with limited exceptions.

Leaders across the country are telling families to mask up because the data shows it is the best way to protect ourselves and one another from Covid-19. Wearing a mask has been proven to reduce the chance of spreading Covid-19 by about 70 percent. Modeling from the University of Washington indicates that more than 40,000 lives would be spared nationwide if 95 percent of the population wore a mask while in public. Wearing a mask can also reduce the harsh economic impact the coronavirus has had on our country. A study conducted by Goldman Sachs concluded that a federal mask mandate could substitute for lockdowns that could cause a 5 percent drop in G.D.P. And if Americans do not mask up in public, cases could rise and we could be forced to close down more of our businesses -- including the auto manufacturing plants that employ thousands of Michigan workers. Major retailers have also recognized the importance of wearing masks. Meijer, Wal-Mart and Kroger all adopted mask requirements for their stores nationwide, and the National Retail Federation has called on all retailers to do the same. I am glad to see stores like these put the safety of their employees and customers first. The president should follow their lead and issue a federal mandate that requires masks in businesses across the country. The heroes on the front lines of this crisis go for hours without taking their masks off every day. Doctors, nurses, emergency medical technicians and child care and grocery store workers wear them when they are on the job and putting their own lives on the line to protect us. We owe it to them to wear our masks when we go to the grocery store. Parents, students and teachers across the country are constantly wondering whether schools will reopen for in-person learning in the fall. The president has said repeatedly that he thinks our kids should go back to school.

But I am not sending kids and our education work force into our schools unless it is safe to do so. And the most effective way we can protect our students and the millions of dedicated educators across the country is to ensure we all mask up now. This can be accomplished best through a federal mandate. Wearing a mask is not a political statement; it is about protecting our loved ones from the spread of this deadly virus. I know the president has begun to understand that -- he wore a mask on his visit to the Walter Reed military hospital this month. And on Monday, he tweeted that ""it is Patriotic to wear a face mask when you can't socially distance."" I applaud his statement, and urge him to back it up by issuing a nationwide mask mandate like Michigan's, requiring masks on public transport, indoors, or outdoors when a distance of six feet cannot be maintained. It allows exemptions for small children, when eating or drinking, communicating with a hearing-impaired person, officiating at a religious service and for those engaged in a public safety role. The president has the chance to save tens of thousands of lives. I am hopeful that he will seize this opportunity. In the meantime, be smart, be safe and mask up, America.","It would save many lives — and save the economy, too.",00ad0ddc-3612-5b31-9356-b11b9784abef,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/22/opinion/22whitmer1/22whitmer1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=6bed92e8f5e71c564b306cac26aaf5a3a800ad8b83d8dd25c1c965f93da53f18&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gov.

Real Estate,Why Rents Haven't Dropped in New York City,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/realestate/why-rents-havent-dropped-in-new-york-city.html,"As hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers have fled the city to wait out the coronavirus pandemic, renters who have stayed in their apartments are wondering if and when rents might fall. With so many fewer people in the city and the region just now taking tentative steps toward reopening, many tenants have hoped and believed that landlords, presumably struggling to fill vacancies, would be willing to reduce rents. But those looking to sign or renew leases in the last few months say that while some landlords are grudgingly offering short-term concessions, like a free month of rent, most are unwilling to budge on pre-pandemic pricing and, in some cases, are even increasing rents. ""There is a disconnect between what tenants expect and landlords are willing to give,"" said Gary Malin, chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group. ""So far, landlords are getting rent and not sitting on vacancies, so they're not giving 30 percent discounts."" As the pandemic hobbled huge sectors of the economy, there were dire predictions that many tenants would not be able to pay their rent. But rent collection has remained surprisingly strong during the spring. In New York, a statewide moratorium on evictions passed on March 20 and later extended through Aug. 20 gave renters a reprieve, but because they were still legally obligated to pay their rent, and had to negotiate any rent forgiveness individually with their landlords, many were compelled to continue paying.

Through May 20, landlords across the country reported that they had received 90.8 percent of rents, compared with 93 percent a year earlier. Government aid and informal negotiations between landlords and tenants likely helped stabilize the situation, but as the aid money dwindles in the coming months, collection rates are likely to drop. In April and May, rents in New York City actually went up year over year, according to StreetEasy's Rent Index, which measures growth over time. From April to May, rates stayed essentially flat, but year over year May rents were up 0.7 percent in Manhattan, to $3,273, and 3.7 percent in Brooklyn, to $2,744. That's a smaller annual increase than normal, but an increase nonetheless. But discounts crept up, too, according to StreetEasy economist Nancy Wu. In May, the number of discounted rentals on the site climbed to 24 percent, up from 14.5 percent in May 2019, according to a StreetEasy analysis. And the discounts were bigger, too -- 7.9 percent of the total asking rent, up from 4.8 percent in 2019. Jeffrey E. Levine, founder and chairman of Douglaston Development LLC, said that during the first two months of the pandemic, there was no change in occupancy numbers at Douglaston's properties and that rent collection rates hovered around the 90th percentile for market-rate properties -- down from 98 to 99 percent in a typical year, but not as much as they'd feared. ""In May, we did start to see people leaving the buildings, people who'd had their jobs affected by the virus or were relocating outside the city, increasing vacancy rates,"" Mr. Levine said. ""That, combined with not being able to do real tours, made us decide to offer current and new prospective tenants up to one month free for renewal or a new lease.""

But while many landlords prefer a one-time deal, renters are often wary of such agreements because they pave the way for a rent hike the next year. Chase Kreuter, who started looking for a one-bedroom in Murray Hill this spring, didn't want to sign a lease with promotional pricing for that reason. Her broker, Matt Bauman, the founder of Bauman Realty, was able to find an apartment in a doorman elevator building on East 29th Street with an actual -- not net-effective -- rent of about 8 percent less than it would normally be for this time of year, but the negotiations ended there. ""I was trying to get them to lock in a two-year lease, or agree to a rate for next year,"" Mr. Bauman said. ""They weren't budging. They were willing to offer these rates now, but think by next year it will be back to normal."" Cody Stockton didn't see why he should agree to a rent increase on his apartment, especially during a pandemic, even if the landlord did offer a free month. Plus, he found nearby three-bedrooms that were renting for less. When Cody Stockton's landlord asked for a 1.5 percent increase on his $3,250 three-bedroom share in Bedford-Stuyvesant for a July 1 renewal, the 22-year-old financial researcher aggregated rents for every three-bedroom apartment he found on StreetEasy within a three-mile radius. After finding that the average rent was $2,996, Mr. Stockton offered to re-sign at $3,100. The landlord countered with a free month, but still wanted the 1.5 percent increase, which would have averaged out to $3,025 a month -- $75 less a month than Mr. Stockton had offered. Mr. Stockton said he wouldn't re-sign on principle. ""Yes, we get a month free, but you're still charging more,"" he said. ""I don't want to move, but there's a place right down the street, a newer property, that's renting for less."" Brokers and experts attribute the stubbornly high rents to a lack of inventory: By the end of April, the number of new rental listings on the market had fallen 33 percent from 2019, according to StreetEasy, resulting in the fewest new leases on record for the month of May in a decade, according to real estate brokerage Douglas Elliman. Many renters whose leases were up this spring decided not to move, working out extensions or renewals instead. Demand is down, too, although many temporary price drops, discounted sublets and other deals offered to existing tenants aren't reflected in the data.

""New leases are only about a third of the market, and the new leasing activity you're seeing now is down 70 percent year over year,"" said Jonathan Miller, of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. ""Right now the market data is massively distorted. I think it's pretty clear if you remove the distortion, rents are already going down."" Landlords are often open to negotiation and price cuts -- up to a point. Sudha Sahai owns a total of six furnished apartments in the East Village and Gramercy, which she typically rents by the month as corporate housing. When the pandemic hit in March, she listed one of the units, a one-bedroom in the East Village, for $6,000 a month with Bill Kowalczuk, an associate broker at Warburg Realty. After the apartment sat on the market for a few weeks, Ms. Sahai told Mr. Kowalczuk to knock the price down to $5,500. A couple ultimately offered $5,000 for the space, which Mr. Kowalczuk negotiated up to $5,200, with the renters paying the full broker's fee. ""For monthly furnished I get more -- so much more I'm not even going to tell you,"" Ms. Sahai said. ""I wanted it rented."" Mr. Kowalczuk described that deal as a fair one, but said that many renters are being unrealistic. He's been regularly fielding offers at 20 to 50 percent below asking prices. One opportunistic renter even tried to finagle a 10-year lease on the Gramercy Park townhouse Ms. Sahai owns, at a 70 percent discount. A lot of landlords also feel that when real estate agents begin to show properties again during Phase 2 of New York City's reopening plan -- Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Wednesday that the city is set to begin Phase 2 on Monday -- there will be a surge of pent-up demand. As brokers pointed out, landlords who have waited this long want to see that play out before cutting prices. ""It's going to be a compression of a spring, summer and fall market,"" said Jared Antin, the director of sales at Elegran, a New York brokerage. ""If you were intending to move you're still intending to move. We've actually seen bidding wars for some of our properties."" Among them was a three-bedroom townhouse in Prospect Lefferts Gardens asking $5,900 that garnered multiple offers after being on the market for just a day, he said. But those who watch the market closely say that, as the economic recession sets in, prices will most likely fall, if not very fast and not by much at first. At least initially, people may not see big discounts, according to Mr. Miller, but general conditions convey a sense of weakness in the rental market.","Many renters anticipated that rents might go down because of the coronavirus, but most landlords have refused to budge.",274dad06-0873-55e2-b4d6-51165a08688c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/21/realestate/16rentals1/merlin_160918041_234cdf1d-7b0d-46c4-b0cb-9302d043d791-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6a5c2a314d05c95f7fc1cc21c4e5880a87d28665524f958159f65c9792909171&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Many renters assumed that New York being a global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic would result in falling rental prices.

The home-sharing program introduced her to Loretta Halter, 66, who had moved to New York from Georgia five years earlier, after retiring from her job as a store manager of a national grocery chain. Ms. Halter, who described the move north as the fulfillment of a long-simmering dream, was happy to trade in her three-bedroom house for a furnished room in the city.

""I have a master's in fine arts, so I love to go to the museums, ballets,"" she said. ""If I'd have stayed in Georgia, the only question would have been where to eat every night and I couldn't take that."" Ms. Tall, a frequent museumgoer who also draws and paints -- she has been taking figurative art classes at Spring Studio in SoHo for the past 25 years -- quickly sensed that she had found a kindred spirit in Ms. Halter, who moved in last October.

""Loretta loves culture and I saw her as a very responsible person,"" Ms. Tall said. ""I was drawn to her positive nature and had great respect for the fact that she'd picked herself up from Georgia and came to New York. That takes a lot of courage."" Ms. Halter's papillon dog, Aes, sealed the deal. ""I fell in love with Aes immediately,"" Ms. Tall said. ""He was the piece de resistance!""

Fortunately, Ms. Tall's cat, Noah, who had never met a dog before, didn't object. ""I've got to brag on her,"" Ms. Halter interjected. ""She is the perfect hostess."" The home-sharing program, which requires only one participant in a match to be 60 or older, made sense for both women. ""It's not easy to find a roommate,"" Ms. Tall said. ""Home Share will follow up; they call after and make sure the match is going well. You feel that they know what they're doing."" As the one on the hunt for a furnished room, Ms. Halter said searching on Craigslist felt ""treacherous."" She said she would hear things like: ""There are 30 other people who also want the room."" Or sometimes more disquieting: ""We were looking for someone younger."" The women touch base each day to coordinate schedules and avoid any potential bathroom conflicts. Sometimes, they'll attend a movie or a Broadway show together -- they recently saw ""Chicago"" -- and they both love going to the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Drop-in Drawing sessions. But they are also careful to give one another space.

The apartment is Ms. Halter's fourth Home Share. Most recently, she lived in Midwood, Brooklyn, but had to leave when her hostess broke her hip and needed Ms. Halter's room for a live-in health aide. The change of boroughs has proved a huge boon for a culture lover like Ms. Halter. In Midwood, she would have to allow up to three hours for a trip to the Metropolitan Opera, which involved two buses and a subway. After the performance, she sometimes would not get home until around 2 a.m., especially if she had waited at the stage door to get her program signed. And she almost always did, especially if Matthew Polenzani was performing. ""Matthew Polenzani is my favorite tenor -- someone of his caliber only comes along every few hundred years,"" Ms. Halter gushed. ""I'm a bit star-struck. When you meet someone like that, knowing what they've accomplished. "" While her host in Midwood was understanding about the occasional late opera nights, Ms. Halter said she felt that it was disruptive to the household. ""They were kind about it, but I could tell it was hard on them,"" she said. ""I don't like to go against the desires of the house. Beverly though, she takes it like a trooper."" Ms. Tall laughed, saying, ""She comes home and I'm like, 'Hi! How was it?'"" ""She'll be up painting or watching a program on PBS,"" Ms. Halter said. ""It's wonderful that we can share a cultural event,"" Ms. Tall said. ""We'll talk about it a little bit, and then we'll each go into our own room.""",A home-sharing program for older renters matches two art lovers in a two-bedroom in Morningside Heights.,38fe9319-1aeb-5408-9bc2-36eb97214e95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/05/realestate/05RENTER1/05RENTER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=9ab0af623615d42ae38fef86f5ac1e237ae14186d61feb76e2282246f337e7a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Loretta Halter, left, with her dog, and Beverly Tall at their two-bedroom apartment in Morningside Heights.",38fe9319-1aeb-5408-9bc2-36eb97214e95,N24News/imgs/38fe9319-1aeb-5408-9bc2-36eb97214e95.jpg,7
Movies,'Chained for Life' Review: Truths Seen and Unseen,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/10/movies/chained-for-life-review.html,"Trying too hard to be helpful, Mabel gives the less-seasoned Rosenthal a quick acting lesson, during which Schimberg cuts between close-ups of his stars' faces. Part of the sweetness of the film is that Rosenthal quickly emerges as the most good-humored person on set, and Pearson as an actor of great charm. (The name Rosenthal may mark him as an outsider in a different sense -- that is, as a Jew.)

""Chained for Life"" aims to complicate ideas about what constitutes beauty and sincerity onscreen. It even hints at a loose parallel between plastic surgery, which can be seen as helping people look the way they feel inside, and filmmaking; both are mechanisms for creating illusions, but also have the potential for revealing hidden truths. Schimberg's film is odd, darkly funny and -- when it means to be -- a little frightening.",The director Aaron Schimberg explores ideas surrounding physical beauty in a film about filmmaking.,a3698ba4-c6b2-52f5-9de4-f372c233edf5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/11/arts/10CHAINEDFORPIX/10CHAINEDFORPIX-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=819cbe42d30ad6f581d960ae07925fce9f71348aa88c0d2db09265c4ee45766f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jess Weixler and Adam Pearson in a scene from &ldquo;Chained for Life.&rdquo;,a3698ba4-c6b2-52f5-9de4-f372c233edf5,N24News/imgs/a3698ba4-c6b2-52f5-9de4-f372c233edf5.jpg,5
Technology,Fitting Your Photos on Instagram,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/26/technology/personaltech/instagram-fitting-photos.html,"Q. I thought Instagram now lets you post photos that aren't in the standard square format, but it's still cropping my pictures. Also, is it changing the resolution of my original image when I upload it?

A. Instagram supports photos in the rectangular landscape and portrait orientations -- as long as you switch it from the default square shape before you upload the file. To do that, tap the round gray arrow icon in the bottom corner of the image preview.

Instagram's help guide says the service supports photos and videos only with aspect ratios between 1.91:1 (a horizontal wide-screen/landscape shape) and 4:5 (a vertical portrait shape); the traditional square shape has an aspect ratio of 1:1. If the photo you upload is not in one of Instagram's supported aspect ratios, it will be cropped automatically.","The image-sharing social network goes beyond the traditional picture squares, but it does have standards for shape and size.",9a07d503-8b26-5cd2-a203-db6a1439e4f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/27/technology/personaltech/27techtipwebART/27techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=b4ca461667f442fefbf0cb3008db48c466a4398e8148f2d1b1b0fe0c968fd051&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Instagram crops photos into the square format unless you tap the gray arrow button in the bottom-left corner to change the picture dimensions, but the service also has standards for overall picture resolution and aspect ratio.",9a07d503-8b26-5cd2-a203-db6a1439e4f9,N24News/imgs/9a07d503-8b26-5cd2-a203-db6a1439e4f9.jpg,20
