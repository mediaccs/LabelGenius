Automobiles,A High-Dollar Debutante Ball,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/automobiles/a-high-dollar-debutante-ball.html,"A glittering bumper crop of million-dollar babies will be shown at the 83rd International Motor Show in Geneva, where press previews begin on Tuesday.

While mass-market automakers like Fiat, Ford, General Motors and Volkswagen are struggling in Europe with bloated inventories, falling sales and red ink, many luxury brands are reporting record sales and profits. Hence, an unprecedented number of ultraexpensive new cars will be mixed among the 130 or so premieres at Geneva.

Ferrari, Lamborghini and McLaren will take the wraps off vehicles priced above $1 million. Lamborghini's limited-edition sports car may set a record for vehicular excess; the car is rumored to carry a price tag of more than $4 million.

Not far behind, in terms of stratospheric prices, will be new six-figure vehicles from Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Aston Martin and a wide array of the boutique car builders, performance tuners and design houses that make the Geneva show an annual carnival of automotive excess.","A bumper crop of new million-dollar cars will be shown at the 83rd International Motor Show in Geneva, where press previews begin on Tuesday.",4fbdde93-c109-5705-9fb5-dd60aafd734b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/03/automobiles/subGENEV1silo/subGENEV1silo-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=254&w=600&s=bfe6761869799f76cfbc57f5ea306ce3b4d36fc4d2dc737847656948fd62d513&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"INDEPENDENCE The Bentley Flying Spur, which will be shown in Geneva, gets its own district identity.",4fbdde93-c109-5705-9fb5-dd60aafd734b,N24News/imgs/4fbdde93-c109-5705-9fb5-dd60aafd734b.jpg,23
Music,Kendrick Lamar Shakes Up the Pulitzer Game: Let's Discuss,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-music-pulitzer-prize-damn.html,"The Pulitzer Prizes startled a lot of people this year with an award that's usually greeted as an afterthought: the music prize, which went to Kendrick Lamar's album ""DAMN."" It was not only the first time a music Pulitzer was given to a hip-hop album, but also to any work outside the more rarefied precincts of classical and, occasionally, jazz composition -- indeed, to an album that reached No. 1 on the pop chart. And while it has been reported that ""DAMN."" was the unanimous choice of the Pulitzer music jury, the award was met in other quarters with disgruntlement and even outrage. Here, Zachary Woolfe, the classical music editor of The New York Times, and Jon Pareles, the chief pop music critic, discuss the choice. JON PARELES To me, this prize is as overdue as it was unexpected. When I look at the Pulitzers across the board, what I overwhelmingly see rewarded are journalistic virtues: fact-gathering, vivid detail, storytelling, topicality, verbal dexterity and, often, real-world impact after publication. It's an award for hard-won persuasiveness. Well hello, hip-hop. ZACHARY WOOLFE One comment I read on Facebook, from a gifted young composer and pianist, was ""I have complicated feelings about this, but also, I mean, about damn time."" Yes, and yes. There seems to be broad agreement, which I join, about the quality of ""DAMN."" -- its complexity and sensitivity, its seductive confidence and unity, its dense weaving of the personal and political, the religious and sexual.

But there is also wariness, which I join, about an opening of the prize -- not to hip-hop, per se, but to music that has achieved blockbuster commercial success. This is now officially one fewer guaranteed platform -- which, yes, should be open to many genres -- for noncommercial work, which scrapes by on grants, fellowships, commissions and, yes, awards. ""DAMN."" was the unanimous choice of the Pulitzer music jury. [ Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder. ] PARELES That response is similar to many publishing-world reactions when Bob Dylan got the Nobel Prize in Literature -- that a promotional opportunity was being lost for something worthy but more obscure, preferably between hard covers. A literary figure who had changed the way an entire generation looked at words and ideas was supposed to forgo the award because, well, he'd reached too many people? Do we really want to put a sales ceiling on what should get an award? The New York Times and The New Yorker already have a lot of subscribers ... uh-oh. WOOLFE I don't think there is a universal desire for the Nobel to reward obscurity; I'm sure many who were skeptical of Mr. Dylan's win would have been just fine with the best-selling Philip Roth. But it has felt for decades like an integral part of the Pulitzer's mission is to shine a light on corners of music that are otherwise nearly ignored by the broader culture. The award has acted as a reminder -- though long a way too stylistically limited one -- that artmaking exists beyond the Billboard (and now Spotify) charts. ""DAMN."" is surely deserving, yet its victory feels like another sign of the world, and therefore the musical culture, we live in -- embodied by the streaming services, through which the biggest artists and albums get more and more, and everyone else gets a smaller piece of the pie. This system is corrosive to music, period -- classical, jazz, hip-hop, everything. It's the reality -- and there are certainly a lot of very popular artists who are very meaningful, Mr. Lamar among them -- but I don't like every aspect of it. PARELES I completely agree with you about the unhealthy overall effects of winner-take-all culture. The word ""trending"" makes me instinctively recoil; as critics, you and I both want to direct people beyond popularity charts. But choosing ""DAMN."" wasn't a capitulation to mere popularity. The album is a complex, varied, subtle, richly multilayered work, overflowing with ideas and by no means immediately ingratiating. You have to give it genuine attention and thought to get the most out of it, just as with any other Pulitzer-winning composition.

Meanwhile, wasn't the music Pulitzer, for many decades, largely the captive of a small, insular academic music scene? The Pulitzers refused a special citation for Duke Ellington, who never won the award. They ignored jazz -- artistically subtle and sublime, commercially endangered -- until Wynton Marsalis finally got a Pulitzer in 1997. They were unconscionably late -- looking awfully cliquish to me -- even in recognizing Minimalism: Steve Reich got his Pulitzer in 2009, not in 1977 for ""Music for 18 Musicians."" To me, it looks like some of the squawks are complaints about exclusivity being breached. And if you ask me, it should have happened sooner. I hereby nominate, for a retrospective Pulitzer, Public Enemy's 1988 album ""It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back"": an experimental sonic bombshell, a verbal torrent, a mind expander. For that matter, the Pulitzers were late on Kendrick Lamar, too: ""To Pimp a Butterfly,"" from 2015, has even more musical breadth than ""DAMN."" (which has plenty).

WOOLFE There have been so many missed opportunities. The year after it turned down Ellington -- the main Pulitzer board rejected the music jury's recommendation -- it could have given the regular prize to Coltrane's ""A Love Supreme."" How about Joni Mitchell's ""Blue,"" which could have won in 1972 -- she's Canadian and therefore ineligible, but remember, this is my fantasy world -- over a decade before the prize finally got around to recognizing a female composer? Philip Glass, never quite beloved in the academic realm, remains Pulitzer-less. And I'll just leave this right here: Kanye. You could play these games forever. It is belated and necessary that the award widen to encompass a fuller picture of what music is. But if that widening further marginalizes noncommercial work -- which doesn't view itself as exclusive but simply as endangered in an economic system that conspires against it -- something important will be lost. Responsible eclecticism is what I'd want going forward from Pulitzer juries, for whom the ""DAMN."" award will hopefully be freeing in the best sense.

PARELES What were the pieces from the other two finalists, Ted Hearne and Michael Gilbertson? WOOLFE Like Mr. Lamar, who's 30, these guys are strikingly young. Mr. Gilbertson, 30 as well, wrote a string quartet that veers from glassy to robust, and Mr. Hearne, 35, wrote ""Sound From the Bench,"" a cantata for chamber choir, electric guitars and drums. Like Mr. Lamar's album, the finalists are politically charged: Mr. Hearne, always socially conscious, here mashes up texts from Supreme Court decisions to suggest the ambiguities of identity and humanity. (A corporation has speech, you say?) And Mr. Gilbertson has said that he adjusted his initial sketches for his quartet after the 2016 election, making them ""more introspective and comforting."" Almost as significant as Mr. Lamar's win, for me, is the trio taken together: a new generation, turning the world around it into music. PARELES I'll have to put them in a playlist. I'm not suggesting that the Pulitzers mirror the Top 10 or the Grammys. (Please, no.) And next year, sure, give the prize to an album that sold 11 copies after a lone college gig somewhere. But I think we're seeing a shifting perspective on the way contemporary classical and jazz composition often draw on the ideas of hip-hop or world music or pop, as if to elevate them by carrying them into the concert hall. According to the Pulitzer reporting, ""DAMN."" got added to consideration when the jury was looking into a composition with hip-hop influences, and decided to go to the source -- where the ideas, in this case, are even stronger, both rawer and smarter. The prize citation praises ""DAMN."" for its ""vernacular authenticity and rhythmic dynamism,"" which to me has a whiff of condescension -- there's all sorts of brainpower and artifice in there, too -- but let's enjoy the win. Regarding noncommercial outreach, Mr. Lamar often collaborates with first-rate, innovative jazz musicians, like Kamasi Washington, who not only are happy to work with him but also benefit -- in their own audience growth -- from showing up in his album credits. One thing that also strikes me about giving the award to ""DAMN."" is that it quietly sets aside two previous Pulitzer givens: that the winning piece was performed by live musicians in real time and that it was written by a solitary composer. But ""DAMN."" has multiple producers, composers and performers (even Rihanna and U2 cameos!) layering tracks in studios. Mr. Lamar is the auteur, fully in charge but not the sole creator. It's another way of making music that deserves respect. WOOLFE This year's Pulitzer actually reinforced that old Romantic illusion of the singular composer. It was given to Mr. Lamar alone -- not, as in the Grammys, to the album's songwriting or producing teams, too. PARELES Maybe they should change the citation to ""Kendrick Lamar and staff"" -- like the reporting prizes. To me, both the Dylan Nobel and the Lamar Pulitzer -- which is not the first hip-hop Pulitzer; Lin-Manuel Miranda got that for drama with ""Hamilton"" -- are signals that the old prize-giving institutions are rethinking the ways in which they used to circumscribe the idea of quality. As long as they're conscientious, that can make the awards only more significant.","The rapper's win for ""DAMN."" is overdue recognition for hip-hop but raises concerns about the shrinking number of platforms for noncommercial work.",03fd7b6a-2525-58e4-874b-3f664dc887b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/18/arts/18kendrick-convo1/18kendrick-convo1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f35ab4f1474812006d271c2ac2d504f8bc4cf5eaa008e2b734dcc72869d76b04&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Kendrick Lamar is the first winner of the Pulitzer Prize for music who is not a classical or jazz musician.,03fd7b6a-2525-58e4-874b-3f664dc887b0,N24News/imgs/03fd7b6a-2525-58e4-874b-3f664dc887b0.jpg,12
Science,An App to Help Save Emissions (and Maybe Money) When Buying a Car,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/28/science/smartphone-app-car-emissions.html,"But, I hear you say, a driver of an electric car in California will be getting cleaner power than a driver in the Midwest, which is heavily dependent on coal-fired power plants, right?

The paper, by Jessika E.

Automobiles,"Some Porsche Purists Like It Hot, and They're Sweating to Prove It",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/21/automobiles/autoreviews/some-like-it-hot-and-theyre-sweating-to-prove-it.html,"Some Porsche Purists Like It Hot, and They're Sweating to Prove It

WHAT IS IT? A two-seat midengine Porsche that has been lightened, lowered and lettered. HOW MUCH? Base price, $67,250. As tested, $85,100, including PDK dual-clutch automated manual transmission, ceramic brakes, Sport Chrono package and Sports Exhaust System. WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 3.4-liter direct-injected flat 6 producing 330 horsepower and 273 pound-feet of torque. HOW QUICK IS IT? Quite quick: Car and Driver magazine clocked a 0-to-60 m.p.h. run in 4.2 seconds. Top speed is 174 m.p.h.

IS IT THIRSTY? The federal mileage rating is 20 city/29 highway m.p.g. with the PDK transmission or 19/27 m.p.g. with a conventional 6-speed manual. I CAN'T remember the last car I drove without air-conditioning -- let alone a sweltering $85,000 Porsche. But while an August heat wave in New York brought new meaning to the term ""triple-digit car testing,"" the Cayman R was worth every drop of perspiration expelled in its parboiled cabin. While a two-seat movable sauna may not be your idea of fun, some Porschephiles may find the Cayman R is right in their comfort zone. Buyers have the option of deleting the air-conditioning and the basic radio; the price is the same with or without the frills. Or they can pay extra to add fancier audio components or even a navigation system. But the point of this purist version of the standard Cayman is to carve away fat and reveal the lasting beauty of bare-bones performance. Like its philosophical twin, the 2,811-pound Boxster Spyder convertible, the Cayman R seems intended to perk up sales of an aging model. As with the Spyder, this Cayman R is no cynical, surface upgrade, but a sports car whose advantages were apparent from my first go-round at the Monticello Motor Club northwest of New York City.

The Cayman's flat 6 squeezes out 330 horsepower at 7,400 r.p.m., only 10 more horses than the Cayman S. But this 2,855-pound fighter drops 121 pounds from the S version, substituting such weight watchers as aluminum doors and front luggage lid, carbon-fiber seat frames and Porsche's most feathery 19-inch wheels -- the set weighs about 88 pounds. The result is a car roughly as quick as a Corvette Grand Sport but with superior balance and handling, aided by the matchless midengine layout. The body was lowered by 0.79 inches and the suspension was stiffened. A fixed rear wing helps reduce aerodynamic lift. That wing, unfortunately, looks tacked-on and incongruous. Nostalgic Porsche lettering scrawls along the lower body sides, evoking models including the 911 R of 1967. Another historical link is forged inside, where utilitarian fabric straps have replaced the door handles. Cute, but it strikes me as a retro affectation. The racing seats are ideal for the track or the twisties, though the backrests are not adjustable. For everyday use, their hip-crunching entry reminded me of squeezing into an elementary school desk. This being Porsche, buyers can pay for less confining, more adjustable seats. My deep-blue Cayman came with the optional Sport Chrono package and the PDK transmission. I prefer the 6-speed manual, but the PDK makes the car quicker, and it features a launch control that automatically drops the clutch for perfect takeoffs. This Cayman also features proper shift paddles, not the maddening up-and-down buttons found in some other Porsches. The Sport Chrono includes a lap timer, albeit one that is too complicated. But what makes it a must-have option are push-button settings that bump up the throttle and redline, goose the PDK into snappier operation and activate the optional Sports Exhaust system.

Ceramic composite brakes, at a wallet-busting $8,150, come into their own only on track, where they stand up to all-day torture with no trace of fade. Like the Boxster Spyder, the Cayman R makes a clear case: if you're willing to sacrifice some comfort, or scoff at it outright, these are the versions you'll want. The Cayman tugged on my hands and heartstrings on the track, accompanied by Sam Schultz, Monticello's track director, who happens to be a professional Porsche racer. During my stint on the 22-turn course, the Cayman reminded me of its most winning quality: no matter your driving skills, the car is always predictable and forgiving, yet fast and sophisticated enough to satisfy the experts. Proving the point, I traded places with Schultz, who casually knocked out a few dazzling laps. ""It's so neutral and balanced,"" he said, playing the car like a fast bluegrass fiddle. But he did flag the PDK's annoying tendency to downshift unexpectedly in the middle of a turn, which upsets the car's poise. This Porsche also feels bulletproof. After an intense workout at the track, I drove the Cayman R home through rush-hour Manhattan, as laid-back as an orthodontist in a 911 -- except for keeping the windows wide open to force some superheated air inside. (Call me a wimp, but I'm not ready to revisit the pre-A.C. era for the sake of 29 pounds.) Cool breeze or not, people who prefer Porsches stuffed like a foie gras goose will run screaming from the Cayman R. But if they choose, say, a 911 coupe or even a 911 S -- which cost a respective $12,700 or $25,600 more -- they won't be able to shake their stripped-down cousin.","The Cayman R is all about performance, and to help provide it, the car has shed weight.

Health,Does Testosterone Really Give Caster Semenya an Edge on the Track?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/01/health/caster-semenya-testosterone.html,"Does Testosterone Really Give Caster Semenya an Edge on the Track?

The Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne, Switzerland, has ruled that women with very high testosterone levels -- far above the normal range -- cannot compete against other women in races from 400 meters to one mile unless they take drugs to suppress production of the hormone. The ruling prevents Caster Semenya, 28, an elite runner and Olympic champion from South Africa, from competing in those races because her testosterone levels are naturally very high. She had challenged attempts to disqualify her from racing as a woman. The science underpinning that decision is complicated, raising difficult questions about biology, fairness and gender identity. What is testosterone? Where does it come from in women? It's a hormone, an androgen, that has a variety of effects on the body. Women and men produce testosterone, but women don't make nearly as much.

In men, high levels of testosterone are made by the testes. Much lower levels are produced in the adrenal glands, which rest above the kidneys. Women also make testosterone in their adrenal glands, and in their ovaries. But testes produce much more: Testosterone levels in men are 295 to 1,150 nanograms per deciliter of blood, while the levels in the women are 12 to 61 nanograms per deciliter of blood. Why would that matter to athletes? Testosterone ""builds muscle,"" said Dr. Benjamin D. Levine, who studies sex differences in athletic performance at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. ""It builds skeletal muscle, it builds cardiac muscle. It increases the number of red blood cells.""

* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. The effects are seen whether the hormone is naturally present or introduced with drugs. In one of the most infamous examples, women who represented East Germany at the Olympic Games in the '70s and '80s achieved astounding success after they were unknowingly doped with anabolic steroids including testosterone. ""The science is quite clear,"" said Dr. Aaron Baggish of Massachusetts General Hospital, who is an expert on testosterone's effects. ""An androgenized body has a performance advantage.""

But don't different bodies always have varying competitive advantages? Why single out this hormone? Most medical experts believe that testosterone is exceptional, not like a long arm span in a swimmer or another natural physical advantage. In one study, Dr. Levine put sedentary young men and young women through a year of athletic training. At the start, the men and women had similarly sized hearts. A year later, the men's hearts were much larger, the result of muscle-building directed by the hormone. The hormone's effects are amplified among elite athletes, altering the body in ways that can make a huge difference in performance. Male champions in every sport are always much faster and stronger than women who set world records. [Read more about Caster Semenya's early life, and what she means to South Africa.] The gap can be quite wide. Elite female runners would never win races if they competed against elite men, according to Doriane Coleman, a former middle-distance runner who is now a law professor at Duke University. Ms. Coleman has reviewed the best performances of three female athletes who were the fastest 400-meter runners in history (and were not injecting testosterone). In 2017 alone, she found, more than 10,000 men and boys running 400-meter races beat the best times these women ever ran.

Ms. Coleman said that in these events, the athletes' results ""show that they have a clear performance advantage."" These athletes won 30 medals in Olympic and world championship races at distances ranging from 400 to 1,500 meters. Their incidence in the general population is just 1 in 20,000, meaning they were overrepresented by about 1,700-fold on the podium, the study concluded. Scientists believe that very high testosterone levels yield a competitive advantage to women in every sport. Still, experts like Dr. Baggish and Dr. Levine -- who were consulted by the International Association of Athletics Federations -- endorsed a limited ruling, because the middle-distance races are where testosterone makes a clearest difference. Doesn't a decision like this conflict with society's broadening definitions of gender? The court's ruling is not about accepting intersex or transgender people in society, Ms. Coleman said. It is about allowing elite female athletes to compete on a level-playing field. But that raises another interesting question: Why do we segregate athletes according to dated ideas of gender in the first place? ""The issue is why do we have women's sports at all,"" Dr. Levine said. ""I think it is critical to protect women, to give them a chance to be successful.""","Probably so, medical experts say. But whether that means athletes like her should be barred from competitions is a fraught question.",5dd56cee-ce58-54bf-a1e3-7016a5e82ee5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/sports/01SEMENYA-MEDICAL1/01SEMENYA-MEDICAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=ae28655eb41a812f22f0a2b9ac10d3a37390fcba995a8a43c6cf15ff59657106&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Caster Semenya, right, competing in a women's 800-meter race at a meet in Zurich in August.",5dd56cee-ce58-54bf-a1e3-7016a5e82ee5,N24News/imgs/5dd56cee-ce58-54bf-a1e3-7016a5e82ee5.jpg,1
Dance,Review: Paloma Herrera and Xiomara Reyes Give Farewell Performances of 'Giselle',https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/29/arts/dance/review-paloma-herrera-and-xiomara-reyes-give-farewell-performances-of-giselle.html,"The affection in which the ballerinas Paloma Herrera and Xiomara Reyes have been held was matched on Wednesday by the warmth with which they greeted their colleagues and audiences at their farewell performances.  Two farewells in one day in successive performances of the same ballet? That was not the original plan, but Ms. Herrera realized in March that ""Giselle,"" which she was already set to dance at the matinee, would make a more becoming goodbye vehicle than a subsequent ""Sleeping Beauty."" She was right; the heroine Giselle lives and breathes dance, dances for love and dances after death. American Ballet Theater did both ballerinas proud: The occasions were special, proud, tender. One by one, principal dancers and staff members -- including Natalia Makarova (for Ms. Herrera), Nina Ananiashvili (for Ms. Reyes) and at both performances Angel Corella, Marcelo Gomes, David Hallberg, Julie Kent, Irina Kolpakova, Gillian Murphy, the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky (artist in residence), and the company's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie -- brought bouquets onstage; there were embraces, too. In a particularly touching gesture, members of the corps de ballet presented each ballerina with a single white rose. The flowers became a rising heap at center stage, and confetti slowly fell.

Tamara Karsavina, Diaghilev's Giselle and a famously intelligent ballerina, once said, ""Leave the stage before the stage leaves you."" Both Ms. Herrera and Ms. Reyes have been virtuosi, able to whip up the bravura of ""Don Quixote"" and other war horses with merry flair; both have created lovely roles in ballets by Mr. Ratmansky (Ms. Reyes in ""Seven Sonatas""; Ms. Herrera in ""On the Dnieper,"" both in 2009) and others. And on Wednesday they showed that they retained the technique for Giselle. During Act Two, each was recalled to the stage for a prolonged ovation after one variation. Despite many parallels, however, these were entirely different performances.

Ms. Reyes, whose professional career began in the 1990s, joined American Ballet Theater in 2001 and became a principal in 2003. She has sustained a partnership there with Herman Cornejo, who on Wednesday evening was in superlative form as an actor, dancer and partner. Ms. Reyes made Giselle remarkably shy, vulnerable and sweet -- and that sweetness became the endearing dominant note of her curtain calls. Ms. Herrera joined Ballet Theater as an unusually young corps dancer in 1991 and swiftly ascended to become a principal in 1995. She has said she intends to retire from dancing before her 40th birthday in December; in October, she will give a farewell (in John Cranko's ""Onegin"") in her native Buenos Aires. She has been happily diverse, ranging from the full classicism of George Balanchine, Frederick Ashton and the 19th-century classics to the bold, slangy charm of several ballets by Twyla Tharp. She has played character roles, too (remember her as the New Yorker with a handbag in Jerome Robbins's ""Fancy Free""?). On Wednesday afternoon, she was partnered by Roberto Bolle, who, though devoid of interpretive individuality, is an exemplary partner and has many enviable perfections -- of looks, technique, style. He rose to the occasion, delivering a series of entrechat-six that I hope nobody ever surpasses in quantity (enough already). Ms. Herrera was also on top form: wonderfully musical, unexaggerated and unmannered, lingering glowingly on steps as if paying her farewell to each of them. I've never admired the handsome arches of her feet more or the full-fingered simplicity of her hands. As with Ms. Reyes, there were moments of sadness amid the final applause for her, but more of joy. Some people were even chanting ""Pa-lo-ma."" Just now it's raining ballerina farewells. Carla Korbes will leave Pacific Northwest Ballet on June 7; Ms. Kent leaves American Ballet Theater on June 20; Sylvie Guillem's farewell tour is spanning from March to December and from New York (November) to Tokyo (December).

It's heartening therefore to report on the exceptional luster shown by the young Skylar Brandt in the peasant pas de deux on Saturday and Wednesday afternoons.

Opinion,Cooperative Competition Is Possible Between China and the U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/24/opinion/china-us-biden.html,"Ms. Fu, a former ambassador and vice foreign minister of China, is the director of the Center for International Security and Strategy and an adjunct professor at Tsinghua University. She is a vice chairwoman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the 13th National People's Congress.



Acting editorial page editor Kathleen Kingsbury wrote about the decision to publish this Op-Ed in Tuesday's edition of the Opinion Today newsletter. BEIJING -- The domestic politics of major countries are never kept within their borders -- and the future policy orientation of the United States has become a hot topic for many people in China. There is no denying the fact that China-U.S. relations have suffered serious damage over the past four years. Each country has expressed much complaint and concern about the other. The United States believes that China craves world hegemony. China sees the United States as trying to block China's way forward and as hindering its people's pursuit of a better life. It seems that both sides are convinced it is always the other party that is in the wrong; any initiative one of them undertakes is invariably seen by the other as an attempt to undermine it.

As relations grew more tense in recent years, Washington started bullying Chinese high-tech companies and making things difficult for Chinese students. I have met many young Chinese entrepreneurs who studied in America and who today are puzzled to be treated like a security threat to the United States, after many years of a productive partnership between our two countries. The politicization of even people-to-people exchanges has left many wondering if what had long been mutually beneficial ties can be reinvigorated. To refresh the relationship, each side must accurately assess the other's intentions. China does not want to replace U.S. dominance in the world. Nor does China need to worry about the United States changing China's system. And it would be a tragedy of history if two countries of such power moved toward confrontation based on misperceptions. That would only work against their own fundamental interests, and many businesses and people would pay the price.

Both governments have heavy domestic agendas to attend to, and so even if competition between China and the United States is unavoidable, it needs to be managed well, cooperatively. It is possible for the two countries to develop a relationship of ""coopetition"" (cooperation + competition) by addressing each other's concerns. In the fields of economics and technology, rules and laws must prevail. It is important that Beijing listen to and address the legitimate concerns of American companies in China, such as their calls for better intellectual property protection, cybersecurity and privacy. China is making strong efforts in all these areas by improving its laws and their enforcement. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress recently adopted amendments to China's copyright law, raising the cost of violations, among other things. Washington, for its part, should ensure a level playing field for Chinese enterprises to operate in the United States. America's fear of Huawei's cutting-edge advantages should not be expressed through government bullying: This not only hurts the company, it also limits many people's access to technological progress. The U.S. government should instead be encouraging its companies to work and compete with Huawei. Its attempt to block the popular social media platform TikTok on national security grounds also seems unfair since the United States has not publicly proved its allegations of security violations and the company has vowed to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations. Washington's so-called national security argument against Chinese companies seems hypocritical to the Chinese, considering that China, over the course of four decades or more of reform and opening up, welcomed all kinds of Western technologies and American companies into China -- all the while maintaining its own national security. And yet if the two sides engage in equal and candid negotiations, they should be able to build a solid basis for long-term relations that are beneficial to both. On the political front, it is high time that the United States drop its habit of interfering in other countries' internal affairs. One hopes that Washington will learn from its unsuccessful interventions the world over, for example in Afghanistan, Iraq and Libya. America's concerns that foreign forces might interfere with its presidential elections should serve as a good reminder of why other countries are so sensitive about U.S. intervention in their own domestic affairs.

China finds it offensive when the United States points a finger at the Chinese system or takes action against Beijing for its policies on domestic matters. But China also needs to be more proactive in providing the rest of the world firsthand information about what the country stands for and why it is doing what it is doing. A calmer atmosphere can be cultivated when China and the United States respect each other and acknowledge that the other has a different political system that is working in its own way. In the security field, both countries shoulder responsibilities for ensuring that the peace and tranquillity that the Asia-Pacific region has enjoyed over the years continues to last. The United States should be respectful of China's sense of national unity and avoid challenging China on the issue of Taiwan or by meddling in the territorial disputes of the South China Sea. Admittedly, China's growing navy has put some pressure on the United States in the western Pacific. The U.S. Navy, which has long claimed to be the dominant force in the region, finds the presence of a strong local military power today to be unsettling; its activities close to territories over which China claims sovereignty are met with growing objections from the Chinese military. The United States' insensitivity toward China's concerns over Taiwan and territorial disputes in the South China Sea can only make Beijing suspect Washington's motivations: Does America want to help Taiwan go independent? Is it siding with the other claimants in the region in order to humiliate China as the imperialists did in the past? To avoid any misunderstandings and unexpected conflicts, the two militaries should talk at the strategic level in order to build mechanisms to effectively manage potential crises and find other ways to coexist peacefully. This is not impossible. In the late 1990s, China and the United States established a consultation regime about maritime security. Later, they set up both guidelines for handling unplanned encounters at sea and in the air and a hotline to defuse any possible crises. In recent years, they established formal mechanisms to notify each other of major military activities.",A former vice foreign minister of China proposes a way forward for the world's two leading powers.,42a7c5f6-7aad-51b5-8832-3f8974a36cbf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/26/opinion/26fuying-01/17fuying-01-facebookJumbo.jpg,,42a7c5f6-7aad-51b5-8832-3f8974a36cbf,N24News/imgs/42a7c5f6-7aad-51b5-8832-3f8974a36cbf.jpg,11
Books,What if the Thief Who Steals Your Identity Is Your Mom?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/books/review/the-less-people-know-about-us-axton-betz-hamilton.html,"Betz-Hamilton has widely publicized her story so the revelation, discovered after her mother's death, that Pam was the culprit all along may be familiar to readers. The real mystery, however -- what the book ought to be structured around -- is what motivated her. Why did Pam create the netherworld the family dwelt in and how did her daughter and husband not realize what she was doing? When they came across evidence that Pam was a compulsive shopper, squirreling away ""cheap chunky jewelry"" from the Home Shopping Network, they still don't suspect her. Once, Axton's father confesses to her, he opened the trunk of Pam's car before a supposed work trip to check her spare tire only to discover dog collars, chains, leather straps and a book about S-and-M. But, he says, he accepted Pam's explanation that the stuff was for a video she was making him for Valentine's Day! Absent some indication that the parents practiced S-and-M, her father was turning an exceptionally blind eye. John also says he considered following Pam to figure out where she was going, but then decided he just didn't care.

Didn't care or didn't care to know? Every family has secrets, and often those secrets hide in plain sight -- indeed, that motif is a mainstay of literature. But the particular nature of this family blindness remains frustratingly unexamined. Betz-Hamilton does not discover the truth until she is an adult, three-quarters of the way through the book, and the psychological explanations for her mother's deception (perhaps Pam suffered from X or Y psychopathology) call for much greater exploration.

Betz-Hamilton concludes Pam made over half a million dollars disappear. On her mother's Facebook page and through her mother's acquaintances, she learns that Pam led a secret life where she posed as divorced and paid for booze and restaurants and hotel rooms to meet her lover. Forty pairs of shoes were stuffed under her bed, many unworn. But, as Betz-Hamilton puts it, in rural Indiana ""a person would have to devote an exceptional amount of effort to spend half a million dollars in their lifetime and still have so little to show for it."" She is haunted by the idea that, as Pam hinted to someone, some of the money is hidden in an unknown bank account.

The book might have benefited from a circular structure, opening with the discovery that the doppelganger is the author's mother and then relating the story of her childhood retrospectively, layering in an adult perspective. How is the author's story similar to and different from that of most victims? What is the profile of most thieves and how do they trick us? -- in short, the very subjects on which Betz-Hamilton lectures.

""The Less People Know About Us"" was written in collaboration with Ashley Stimpson, a talented freelance journalist and professional ghostwriter who describes herself as a ""story surrogate"" and was involved in both the writing and the reporting. The resulting book is intimate and engrossing but can also have a claustrophobic, cluttered feel in its thicket of details. As many memoirs do, it includes experiences that were personally formative but are extraneous to the narrative. In stating her objective in writing it, Betz-Hamilton seems to misunderstand the genre. Toward the end, in an incongruously clunky passage, she says that it was ""written with the hope that someone, somewhere, may read it and realize that they have answers to my questions. I would like to know the truth because truth is important.""

Well, yes and no. Naturally, solving the missing pieces of her mother's crime is important to her, but it's not necessarily to the reader. The other purpose of the book, she says, is to help victims of identity theft. But the test of a memoir is its ability not just to speak to those who've had similar experiences but, through the enchantment of good writing, to draw all readers into the writer's unique life despite disjunctures of circumstance. With its piercing evocations of a lonely girl in a disconsolate world trying to protect herself from seen and unseen maternal enmity, this book passes that test better than many, but not, perhaps, as well as it might.","This was the case for Axton Betz-Hamilton, who grew up to become an identity theft expert and tells the bizarre story of her mother's crimes in her new memoir, ""The Less People Know About Us.""",f55e074d-0df5-5b15-8b69-ee0bb4a1b0fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/books/review/27THERNSTROM1/27THERNSTROM1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d7d67144944b6df8f5209776e75d6b82fd61b3c1d0ca073139e95535cbb6e952&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Axton Betz-Hamilton with her parents on one of the family's rare weekend getaways.,f55e074d-0df5-5b15-8b69-ee0bb4a1b0fb,N24News/imgs/f55e074d-0df5-5b15-8b69-ee0bb4a1b0fb.jpg,13

Technology,"No, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccine development has not been 'reckless.'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/technology/covid-vaccines-senate-hearing.html,"Dr. Jane M. Orient, an Arizona internist who will testify before Congress on Tuesday, has raised concerns about the new scientific methods that the drug companies Moderna and Pfizer are using to develop coronavirus vaccines, and about continued calls for widespread vaccination. ""It seems to me reckless to be pushing people to take risks when you don't know what the risks are,"" Dr. Orient said this week in an interview with The New York Times. ""People's rights should be respected. Where is 'my body, my choice' when it comes to this?"" Pfizer and Moderna are indeed relying on new scientific methods for their vaccines, building them around a molecule called messenger RNA, or mRNA, a natural genetic material that instructs the manufacture of proteins in human cells. But the concerns raised by Dr. Orient, who leads the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and was previously criticized for promoting anti-vaccine sentiment, aren't backed by the wealth of scientific evidence to date. Although neither experimental vaccine has yet been given a green light by the Food and Drug Administration for widespread use, both products have been heavily and carefully tested in clinical trials. Early data suggests they are about 95 percent effective at protecting people from developing Covid-19, and neither has shown serious side effects.

Both Pfizer and Moderna have applied for emergency use authorization for their vaccines from the F.D.A. On Thursday, the agency will review Pfizer's case, and many experts expect the product to win approval. On Tuesday, the F.D.A. released documents reaffirming the Pfizer vaccine's safety and effectiveness in a wide range of volunteers, across age, weight and race. Emergency authorization for Moderna's vaccine will probably follow next week. The approvals would kick-start a series of vaccination campaigns that are expected to stretch far into 2021. Mass vaccination, which will curb the pandemic's death toll and most likely slow the spread of disease, is an important step in the fight against the coronavirus. ""Getting vaccinated protects you, but it also protects the people around you,"" said Padmini Pillai, a vaccine researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""And based on data, the virus kills, but the vaccine doesn't."" The mRNA in these vaccines contains the blueprint for a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus. Once produced by cells, this protein acts like a molecular mug shot that teaches the immune system about the coronavirus's most memorable features. This prepares the body to fight the real virus off, should it ever come to call. The process more or less mimics what happens when a virus infects a cell: It, too, must unload its genetic cargo, and force the cell to churn out proteins. But unlike a virus, the mRNA is not infectious and cannot prompt cells to produce active, disease-causing viruses. The molecules are also fragile and do not linger long in cells after they are ""read"" to make proteins. Researchers have no reason to believe they leave a lasting mark on the human body, apart from bolstering its defenses against infection.

Pfizer's vaccine has already been granted emergency approval in Britain. It and Moderna's product are on track to be the world's first fully licensed mRNA vaccines, though similar vaccines have been in development for decades. Neither vaccine has caused serious side effects in clinical trial volunteers. While many recipients have experienced mild symptoms after being injected, including headaches, mild fevers, fatigue and aches, ""that just means the immune system is working,"" Dr. Pillai said. ""Tens of thousands of people have received the vaccine safely."" The F.D.A. and equivalent agencies in other countries take safety seriously when considering whether to give vaccines their stamps of approval. Researchers will also continue to be on the lookout for any unexpected side effects as more people are vaccinated. So far, Dr. Orient's skepticism appears unfounded. Dr. Orient has also attracted criticism for her stalwart defense of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for Covid-19 despite overwhelming evidence that the drug has little benefit and may harm the people who receive it. She will appear on Tuesday before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee in a hearing focused on at-home treatment for Covid-19. She told The Times this week that doctors were too often sending patients home to ride out their disease.","Experts maintain that widespread rollout of these vaccines, which have undergone rigorous testing, is very likely to be safe.",59e33c42-0225-5060-b993-31463b3250eb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/07/science/07distortion-brief-vaccine/07distortion-brief-vaccine-facebookJumbo.jpg,A volunteer receiving Moderna's Covid-19 vaccine in August.

Movies,"New Trailer: 'Tomb Raider,' Starring Alicia Vikander",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/movies/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander-trailer.html,"In September, the first trailer for ""Tomb Raider"" focused on scenes of Alicia Vikander in action as the Indiana Jones-esque adventurer Lara Croft.

That quest takes her to an island in the middle of the Devil's Sea, where she clashes with the film's primary villain, played by Walton Goggins. He's a member of a group known as Trinity that is seeking to set off a worldwide genocide.

Sports,"Without Drew Brees, the Saints Turn to a Not-So-Secret Weapon",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/sports/football/new-orleans-saints-taysom-hill-alvin-kamara.html,"With quarterback Drew Brees out for several weeks because of rib and lung injuries, the New Orleans Saints' Super Bowl hopes rest with a jack-of-all-trades who is sometimes dismissed as a mere role player: the all-purpose running back Alvin Kamara. Sorry, were you expecting the team's backup quarterback, Taysom Hill? Hill, the gadget specialist and wish fulfillment figure currently filling in for Brees, is certainly critical to the Saints' success. But Kamara has been their best offensive performer this season, by far, and he has emerged as a worthy candidate for the N.F.L. Most Valuable Player Award. Through Week 11, Kamara ranked second in the league with 1,179 total yards from scrimmage and 12 combined rushing and receiving touchdowns. His 67 receptions tied him for seventh in the N.F.L. and led all running backs. Per Pro Football Reference, Kamara leads the league with 619 yards after the catch and 14 broken tackles after receptions. Coach Sean Payton lines him up at running back, various wide receiver positions, kick returner and occasionally as a wildcat quarterback to make the most of his diverse talents. Kamara's production has been vital to the Saints in a season in which Brees's skills have continued their noticeable decline and Michael Thomas has missed six games because of injuries and the alluring siren song of wide receiver misbehavior. (Thomas missed one game for ""disciplinary reasons,"" reportedly after an altercation with a teammate during practice.)

The Saints' offense this season often consisted almost entirely of Brees floating soft tosses into the flats or handing off so Kamara could dodge and juke his way around defenders for significant gains. Yet despite their overreliance on one individual, the Saints are 8-2, in first place in the N.F.C. South and at the front of the conference playoff race.

Kamara isn't exactly an unsung hero: He's a three-time Pro Bowl selection and a perennial first-round pick in fantasy football leagues, where his combination of rushing and receiving production is highly coveted. But his contributions may be undervalued, for a variety of reasons. Kamara is a ""committee back"" who shares carries with Latavius Murray. He's an all-purpose back who gets upstaged on statistical leaderboards by rushers whose production is not split into two categories, such as the Minnesota Vikings' Dalvin Cook (the current leader in scrimmage yards and touchdowns) and the Tennessee Titans' Derrick Henry (last year's rushing leader).

* Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. Kamara also lacks the folk hero origin story of Hill, the scrambling 30-year-old perma-prospect who overcame multiple collegiate injuries and worked his way up from the proverbial mailroom of the Saints' practice squad to earn an extended audition as Brees's long-term replacement. Kamara played only a minor role in Hill's starting debut, rushing 13 times for 45 yards and one touchdown (with zero receptions) in Sunday's 24-9 victory over the Atlanta Falcons. Payton surprised the Falcons by treating Hill like a real quarterback instead of building a game plan out of read options and easy tosses to Kamara. Hill surprised his skeptics by looking more like a real quarterback than a Mary Sue written into the Saints' fan fiction to appeal to the middle-aged high school legend demographic.

It's one thing to use unexpected tactics to baffle the hapless Falcons, who earlier in the season mixed up the procedures for handling an onside kick and a live grenade. The Saints face the Denver Broncos' tighter defense on Sunday, and future opponents (including the Falcons again in two weeks) will be ready to take away the Hill-to-Thomas connection. The Saints will need Kamara more than ever. Then Brees will (probably) return as the playoffs approach, and the Saints will go back to needing Kamara just as much as they always have. No matter how irreplaceable Kamara may be to the Saints, he remains a long shot for M.V.P. consideration. The last nonquarterback to win the award was Adrian Peterson in 2012, when he rushed for 2,097 yards. The closest all-purpose performers like Kamara to win the award were LaDainian Tomlinson, who had 2,323 scrimmage yards and 31 touchdowns in 2006, and Marshall Faulk, who had 2,189 combined scrimmage yards and 26 touchdowns in 2000. Kamara is on a pace for 1,886 yards and 19.2 touchdowns: excellent, but not eye-popping enough to win an award almost exclusively reserved for quarterbacks. Kamara's M.V.P. case is far stronger once assumptions about the relative values of quarterbacks and running backs are set aside. He has spent most of the season assisting a fading Hall of Famer whose average throw this season traveled just 5.8 yards downfield (per N.F.L. Next Gen Stats, the second-lowest figure in the league). He's now tasked with propping up a nondenominational Tim Tebow surrogate. He's responsible for 31 percent of the offensive yardage for a team that swept Tom Brady's Tampa Bay Buccaneers and is on a seven-game winning streak. And his dual rusher-receiver role makes him a more effective focal point for a modern N.F.L. offense than workhorses like Cook and Henry. OK, even accounting for all that, Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes may still be a better M.V.P. candidate in 2020. Kamara remains the most valuable player on the Saints. And if he can lead them to the Super Bowl, that's all that will really matter.","Alvin Kamara has lined up for New Orleans at running back, receiver, kick returner and occasionally as a wildcat quarterback to make the most of his diverse talents.",5b2175bc-fa23-57ab-90b9-942531a84b87,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/25/sports/25nfl-tanier-print/25nfl-tanier-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Alvin Kamara ranks second in the league with 1,179 total yards from scrimmage and 12 touchdowns.

Real Estate,Upper East Side Rowhouse Growth Spurt,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/04/realestate/upper-east-side-rowhouse-growth-spurt.html,"When does a coherent row of brownstones become a miscellany of masonry? That point is nearing or even past for the rowhouses on the south side of East 69th Street, from Second to First Avenues. Thirty years ago they were a nearly uniform group of charming dwellings. Now the string has broken, and these little pearls are skittering across the floor.

Not many blocks east of Third Avenue saw sustained rowhouse development, but for some reason in the late 1870s the developer James E. Ray favored this block with a particularly expansive row of 30 houses. He built the houses closer to Second, Nos. 310-344, three stories tall with a high stoop; for those closer to First, Nos. 346-368, he stopped at two stories and a stoop. Ray worked with several architects, and the variations are modest. But in the 20th century, the sweep of the row, especially the two-story models, was striking.

Ads for the houses began running in early 1880, when The New York Times offered No. 340 for rent for $65 per month. The 1880 census indicates that perhaps half the original residents were born abroad, with nativity noted as Germany, Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, Bremen and so on.

The number of residents in 19th-century rowhouses was far higher than we expect today.

""These are game changers,"" said Dr. Gregory Poland, a vaccine researcher at the Mayo Clinic. ""We were all expecting 50 to 70 percent."" Indeed, the Food and Drug Administration had said it would consider granting emergency approval for vaccines that showed just 50 percent efficacy. From the headlines, you might well assume that these vaccines -- which some people may receive in a matter of weeks -- will protect 95 out of 100 people who get them. But that's not actually what the trials have shown. Exactly how the vaccines perform out in the real world will depend on a lot of factors we just don't have answers to yet -- such as whether vaccinated people can get asymptomatic infections and how many people will get vaccinated. Here's what you need to know about the actual effectiveness of these vaccines. What do the companies mean when they say their vaccines are 95 percent effective? The fundamental logic behind today's vaccine trials was worked out by statisticians over a century ago. Researchers vaccinate some people and give a placebo to others. They then wait for participants to get sick and look at how many of the illnesses came from each group.

In the case of Pfizer, for example, the company recruited 43,661 volunteers and waited for 170 people to come down with symptoms of Covid-19 and then get a positive test. Out of these 170, 162 had received a placebo shot, and just eight had received the real vaccine. From these numbers, Pfizer's researchers calculated the fraction of volunteers in each group who got sick. Both fractions were small, but the fraction of unvaccinated volunteers who got sick was much bigger than the fraction of vaccinated ones. The scientists then determined the relative difference between those two fractions. Scientists express that difference with a value they call efficacy. If there's no difference between the vaccine and placebo groups, the efficacy is zero. If none of the sick people had been vaccinated, the efficacy is 100 percent. A 95 percent efficacy is certainly compelling evidence that a vaccine works well. But that number doesn't tell you what your chances are of becoming sick if you get vaccinated. And on its own, it also doesn't say how well the vaccine will bring down Covid-19 across the United States. What's the difference between efficacy and effectiveness? Efficacy and effectiveness are related to each other, but they're not the same thing. And vaccine experts say it's crucial not to mix them up. Efficacy is just a measurement made during a clinical trial. ""Effectiveness is how well the vaccine works out in the real world,"" said Naor Bar-Zeev, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It's possible that the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines will match their impressive efficacy in clinical trials. But if previous vaccines are any guide, effectiveness may prove somewhat lower.

The mismatch comes about because the people who join clinical trials are not a perfect reflection of the population at large. Out in the real world, people may have a host of chronic health problems that could interfere with a vaccine's protection, for example.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a long history of following the effectiveness of vaccines after they're approved. On Thursday, the agency posted information on its website about its plans to study the effectiveness of coronavirus vaccines. It will find opportunities to compare the health of vaccinated people to others in their communities who have not received a vaccine. What exactly are these vaccines effective at doing? The clinical trials run by Pfizer and other companies were specifically designed to see whether vaccines protect people from getting sick from Covid-19. If volunteers developed symptoms like a fever or cough, they were then tested for the coronavirus. But there's abundant evidence that people can get infected with the coronavirus without ever showing symptoms. And so it's possible that a number of people who got vaccinated in the clinical trials got infected, too, without ever realizing it. If those cases indeed exist, none of them are reflected in the 95 percent efficacy rate. People who are asymptomatic can still spread the virus to others. Some studies suggest that they produce fewer viruses, making them less of a threat than infected people who go on to develop symptoms. But if people get vaccinated and then stop wearing masks and taking other safety measures, their chances of spreading the coronavirus to others could increase. ""You could get this paradoxical situation of things getting worse,"" said Dr. Bar-Zeev. Will these vaccines put a dent in the epidemic? Vaccines don't protect only the people who get them. Because they slow the spread of the virus, they can, over time, also drive down new infection rates and protect society as a whole. Scientists call this broad form of effectiveness a vaccine's impact. The smallpox vaccine had the greatest impact of all, driving the virus into oblivion in the 1970s. But even a vaccine with extremely high efficacy in clinical trials will have a small impact if only a few people end up getting it.",You might assume that 95 out of every 100 people vaccinated will be protected from Covid-19.

Technology,Airbnb Raises $1 Billion to Stockpile Cash in Pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/technology/airbnb-coronavirus-valuation.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Airbnb said on Monday that it had raised $1 billion in new funding as it grapples with devastation from the coronavirus pandemic, and as some technology start-ups take extra measures to stockpile cash during the outbreak.

The private equity giant Silver Lake and the investment firm Sixth Street Partners led the investment, which was a mixture of equity and debt. Airbnb, a home rental start-up that was previously valued at as much as $31 billion, also lowered its internal valuation to $26 billion last month, according to a person with knowledge of the situation who declined to be identified because the information was confidential.

""The new resources will support Airbnb's ongoing work to invest over the long term in its community of hosts who share their homes and experiences,"" the company said in a statement.

Airbnb's business has been hobbled during a shutdown in global travel caused by the spread of the coronavirus. It is a delicate time for the company, one of the largest and most prominent start-ups to emerge from Silicon Valley in the last decade. Airbnb had said that it plans to go public this year.

Andrew (Nat Wolff), a young American soldier in Afghanistan, starts his deployment with fortitude. But after he witnesses fellow recruits kill innocent Afghan civilians, he second-guesses his brigade's mission and considers reporting their behavior. What stops him, though, is a terrifying sergeant (Alexander Skarsgard) and the possibility that Andrew's fellow soldiers would kill him, too.

Real Estate,Christian Siriano's Walk-Up World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/realestate/christian-sirianos-walk-up-world.html,"It's been an arduous journey for the fashion designer Christian Siriano: winning Season 4 of the reality show ""Project Runway,"" a triumph that his publicist asked not be mentioned here (sorry); collecting a group of celebrity clients (Taylor Swift, Christina Hendricks, Sarah Jessica Parker and Victoria Beckham among them); and finally establishing himself as a credible -- and fierce -- brand. Then there's that other journey -- five flights -- to the expansive 2,400-square-foot rental in Chelsea that Mr. Siriano, 27, shares with his partner, Brad Walsh, a composer-musician, and their dogs, Topper and Bear. ""For some reason the stairs don't bother us,"" Mr. Siriano said. ""It was a bit of an issue, but once you get up here, for the rent we're paying, I was like, 'We are sucking it up.' "" The payoff at the end of the climb is an anything-but-modern, anything-but-minimalist eyeful. Here, treasures from flea markets and yard sales, like a barn-door sign advertising fresh tomatoes, a gift from their client and close friend Kristen Johnston. There, French antique chairs ""that are just for pretty,"" said Mr. Siriano who, when it comes to syntax, has his own particular style. Everywhere, fabric squares, some draped over the dining table and a nearby chaise longue, many wrapped around the 50 or so pillows. They're for pretty, sure, but also for comfort and a homey feel.

""I'm a huge fan of textiles and I'm a fashion designer who loves interior design,"" said Mr. Siriano, who's as skinny as a wand and who, thanks to that signature asymmetrical hillock of hair, seems taller than he is. ""If you're making clothes and you're referencing a particular time period, you always want to think about the mood of that period. So I'll often look at old furniture because it can inspire a show. The shape of a sofa leg can inspire the shape of a heel. They all work together."" He previewed his resort preview in the apartment this past season. ""I thought it would be nice for the fashion editors and buyers to come to my home and see how the clothes work with my world."" And while he loves shopping for clothes, he said, ""honestly, I get more of a thrill spending my money on furniture and pillows and accessories."" Clearly, the thrills have been many since the couple moved in four years ago. Atop chests, credenzas and a painter's scaffold that has been cleverly repurposed as a back-of-sofa console table are framed photos, candelabra, books, busts, decanters -- and bird cages. ""I definitely have a thing for them,"" Mr. Siriano said. ""I think they're sculptural but not overpowering."" The backdrop for the bird cages and everything else is a multilevel former ballet studio with two huge skylights and generous windows that make the space seem bright even on gray days. The apartment's history greatly pleases the current lessee.

""I was a dancer as a kid,"" said Mr. Siriano, who grew up in Annapolis, Md. ""I loved being backstage and seeing the costumes and watching my mother and the other mothers sewing tulle, so it's very cool to live here."" He went to design school in London, where he interned for Alexander McQueen and Vivienne Westwood. Half a dozen years ago, when his fortunes had improved sufficiently for him to move out of a tiny Lower East Side apartment, Mr. Siriano decided to make his next perch a loft in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. ""I wanted as big a place as possible,"" he said. ""I got something very industrial with polished concrete floors, clean and open and huge."" Two years later, he had had quite enough of the long commute to his showroom in the garment district, quite enough of expensive cab rides and more than enough of the one-big-open-space concept and the aesthetics of clean and uncluttered. ""I still wanted size,"" he said. ""But I wanted a real bedroom that was closed off from everything. I wanted a real separate kitchen."" And here is what he didn't want: a new high-rise, tiny rooms, parquet floors and a lack of luxe and glamour. ""At first I wasn't sure about this,"" he confessed, looking around the apartment, which has been fashioned into three areas -- vignettes, in Siriano parlance -- bedroom, kitchen/living room and main living room/grand salon. ""It's huge, and I guess I was nervous about how we were going to be comfortable in it. We almost moved into a different space not too far away that was Cynthia Rowley's old apartment,"" Mr. Siriano continued. ""A funny thing to think about, but her place had low ceilings."" In this apartment the skylights, which he happily described as ""so weird and special,"" helped them make the final decision. ""And I loved the exposed brick, which was what I wanted when I moved to New York. It's such a cliched thing to think about, but I love it and I think it adds a lot of character."" Of course, the real character here is Mr. Siriano himself. In his hands, the story of painting the apartment becomes a comedy routine. ""The walls were lime green when we moved in. Neon. Very scary. The ceilings in the entryway are 12 feet, in the living room, they're 20 feet. Trust me, painting was not fun and I did it all myself, but do you know what it costs to hire someone?""","The Season 4 winner of  ""Project Runway"" lives in a Chelsea rental with plenty of room for his favorite things.",cbf1ee3d-63bf-5973-ac96-7298ee1ce4cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/03/realestate/03LOVE_SPAN/03LOVE_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=a00640b127d512a39e40613824cb7a36a5bc8097f0e961861b909ae1ceaeeb95&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Christian Siriano at his Chelsea home.,cbf1ee3d-63bf-5973-ac96-7298ee1ce4cc,N24News/imgs/cbf1ee3d-63bf-5973-ac96-7298ee1ce4cc.jpg,7

When Cadaver Dogs Pick Up a Scent, Archaeologists Find Where to Dig



On a sunny summer day in Croatia several years ago, an archaeologist and two dog handlers watched as two dogs, one after another, slowly worked their way across the rocky top of a wind-scoured ridge overlooking the Adriatic Sea. Bodies had lain in beehive-shape tombs on this necropolis, part of the prehistoric hill fort of Drvisica, since the Iron Age. The two dogs, trained to detect human remains, were searching for scents that were thousands of years old. Panda, a Belgian Malinois with a ""sensitive nose,"" according to her handler, Andrea Pintar, had begun exploring the circular leftovers of a tomb when she suddenly froze, her nose pointed toward a stone burial chest. This was her signal that she had located the scent of human remains. Ms. Pintar said the hair on her arms rose. ""I was skeptical, and I was like, 'She is kidding me,'"" she recalled thinking about her dog that day.

Archaeologists had found fragments of human bone and teeth in the chest, but these had been removed months earlier for analysis and radiocarbon dating. All that was left was a bit of dirt, the stone slabs of the tomb and the cracked limestone of the ridge. Human-remains detection dogs, or cadaver dogs, are used worldwide on land and water. Well-trained dogs help find the missing and dead in disasters, accidents, murders and suicides. But the experiment in Croatia marked the start of one of the most careful inquiries yet carried out of an unusual archaeological method. If such dogs could successfully locate the burial sites of mass executions, dating from World War II through the conflicts in the Balkans in the 1990s, might they be effective in helping archaeologists find truly ancient burials? On the scent of new tombs Panda wasn't kidding. Neither was Mali, the other Belgian Malinois trained by Ms. Pintar and her husband, Christian Nikolic. Each dog gave her final indications that day by either sitting or lying inside the flattened circle of the tombs, their noses pointing toward the burial chests within. In some cases they leapt into the small burial chests before offering an alert. The dogs' archaeological expedition had been initiated by Vedrana Glavas, an archaeologist at Croatia's University of Zadar. She already knew a great deal about the necropolis at Drvisica, having fully excavated and analyzed the contents of three tombs there. Inside each were rough limestone burial chests. She and her team recovered amber beads, belt buckles, bronze pins, teeth and phalanges. Each chest once held at least two bodies, which radiocarbon dating confirmed were 2,700 years old. The skeletal material was highly fragmented, however, and is still being analyzed. But were there other tombs on the site, and could the dogs help locate them? After that first preliminary search and its surprising result, Dr. Glavas had beers at a local pub with the dogs' handlers. They decided to hold off any discussion for a few weeks.

That ""test run"" was the beginning of a careful study on whether human-remains detection dogs could be an asset to archaeologists. Setting up a controlled study was difficult. Dr. Glavas had to learn the scientific literature, such as scent theory, far outside the standard confines of archaeology; the same was true for Ms. Pintar and the field of archaeology. The training challenges were also difficult. Ancient human remains probably present a different and fainter scent profile than more recently deceased cadavers, especially as decades turn into centuries and then millenniums. False negatives seemed likely to occur. ""I think dogs are really capable of this, but I think it's a logistical challenge,"" said Adee Schoon, a scent-detection-animal expert from the Netherlands who was not involved in the study. ""It's not something you can replicate again and again. It's hard to train."" And, as Dr. Schoon noted, dogs are ""great anomaly detectors."" Something as subtle as recently disturbed soil can elicit a false alert from a dog that is not rigorously trained. Nonetheless, the team returned to the necropolis for the first controlled tests in September 2015, and again a full year later. Both times, they used all four of Ms. Pintar and Mr. Nikolic's cadaver dogs: Panda, Mali, a third Belgian Malinois and a German shepherd. They worked them on both known and double-blind searches, in areas where nobody knew if tombs were located.

The dogs located four tombs new to the archaeologists. Dr. Glavas had suspected that a fifth site might hold a burial chest, and the dogs' alerts, combined with excavation, proved her suspicion correct. In September 2019, the Journal of Archaeological Method and Theory published the results of their study: ""This research has demonstrated that HRD dogs are able to detect very small amounts of specific human decomposition odor as well as to indicate to considerably older burials than previously assumed,"" Dr. Glavas and Ms. Pintar wrote. Dr. Schoon, who researches and helps create protocols to train scent-detection animals worldwide, said the Iron Age necropolis study was nicely designed and ""really controlled."" Panda and Mali aren't the only dogs in the world that have helped locate human archaeological remains. In the United States, human remains detection dogs have aided discoveries at a variety of Native American sites, some badly damaged by looters and earlier generations of archaeologists with less ethical approaches to excavation, as well as by development and agriculture. Paul Martin, a dog handler and trainer in Tennessee who is finishing his doctorate in earth sciences and geoarchaeology at the University of Memphis, has studied using dogs to find older remains for nearly two decades, demonstrating their capabilities at some of the large earthen mounds across the eastern United States that were once surrounded by flourishing Native American cities and villages. His curiosity was piqued in 2002. Mr. Martin and his trained search dog were helping look for a murder victim in a Mississippi county where an informant said the victim was buried on ""an old Indian mound."" The dog started showing intense interest at the mound, and Mr. Martin suspected that it wasn't the more recent murder that held the dog's attention. He spoke with John Sullivan, then a state archaeologist at Winterville Mounds near Greenville, Miss. Mr. Sullivan was curious, too: ""Paul asked me if dogs would pick up old stuff and I said, 'Only one way to find out.'""

But getting funding and permission to do excavations is difficult. The alerts remained unconfirmed. Nonetheless, nature sometimes kicks out some free clues. That's what happened on Mound H in Winterville, Miss., in 2006. Rodents provided ""ground-truthing,"" or confirming evidence, free of charge by digging new burrows and displacing what had been hidden for centuries. Just downhill from where a number of human remains detection dogs had alerted during earlier training, ""we actually saw a trail of bone coming down the side of the mound,"" Mr. Martin said. A forensic anthropologist confirmed the bones were human, including a child's scapula. Mr. Sullivan believes they come from the last burials at the site, and date to around 1450 A.D. Cadaver dogs are also helping archaeologists at some especially challenging sites. Mike Russo and Jeff Shanks, archaeologists with the National Park Service's Southeast Archeological Center, had created at least 14 test holes near a promising site in northwest Florida that had been flattened during an earlier era of less diligent archaeology. They found nothing.

""We knew where it should be, but when we went there, there was absolutely no mound,"" Mr. Russo said. They then asked Suzi Goodhope, a longtime cadaver-dog handler in Florida, to bring her experienced detection dog, Shiraz, a Belgian Malinois, to the site in 2013. Shiraz and Ms. Goodhope worked the flat, brushy area for a long time. Then, Shiraz sat. Once. Nonetheless, the archaeologists dug. And dug. They went down nearly three feet -- and there they found a human toe bone more than 1,300 years old. What is the future of using human-remains detection dogs as a noninvasive tool in archaeology? Some archaeologists, forensic anthropologists, geologists, scientists -- and even H.R.D. dog handlers who know how challenging the work is -- say they have great potential. But challenges abound. Although researchers are learning ever more about the canine olfactory system, they are still trying to pinpoint what volatile organic compounds in human remains are significant to trained dogs. It's also unclear what concentration of human remains a trained dog can detect, and which aspects of a given environment help retain the scent.

Ms. Pintar and Dr. Glavas speculate that at the site in Croatia used in their study, the porous and cracked limestone on the ridge might play a role in the longevity of the scent there. Perhaps the mountain itself -- used as the base of each burial chest -- held on to the scent for thousands of years. But more research will need to be completed to confirm these findings. Detection dogs also must be trained for archaeology with more consistency. Often humans are the limiting factor. Sometimes, Dr. Schoon said, she can almost see a dog thinking, ""Is that all you want me to do? I can do much more!"" And dogs are only a complement to more standard archaeological tools, Mr. Martin noted. The best results come when good human-remains detection dog teams are combined with ground-penetrating radar, geophysical surveys and historical information, and -- when feasible or desirable -- confirmed with soil tests or excavation. But more archaeologists around the world are taking note of detection dogs' potential. Ms. Goodhope has continued working with park service archaeologists on lost slave cemeteries, Civil War sites and other early Native American sites. And Mr. Sullivan, now with the federal Bureau of Land Management, continues to work with dogs and handlers to locate, and avoid the destruction of, Native American sites. Since Ms. Pintar and Dr. Glavas's Croatia study was published last year, several European and Croatian archaeologists have asked them for help in identifying sites, too. As for the Iron Age necropolis high on the rocky ridge at Drvisica? Dr. Glavas said she doesn't intend to return to excavate there. ""Something has to be left for future archaeologists.""",Recent research highlights the power of the canine nose to uncover buried remains from ancient human history.,1c4e1280-cd6b-520c-aa67-12deeadf19f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/15/science/00SCI-cadaverdogs-1/00SCI-cadaverdogs-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=dc25b03d695eb99cc1c912858f8db4359abee0037d7b517b8b98eb3381194d76&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shiraz, a cadaver dog enlisted to hunt for archaeological remains in February at a suspected Native American burial site in Gulf Breeze, Fla.",1c4e1280-cd6b-520c-aa67-12deeadf19f9,N24News/imgs/1c4e1280-cd6b-520c-aa67-12deeadf19f9.jpg,2
Books,"When Neo-Nazis Marched Through Berlin's Old Jewish Quarter, a Bookshop Took Notice",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/books/when-neo-nazis-marched-through-berlins-old-jewish-quarter-a-bookshop-took-notice.html,"BERLIN -- On a freezing Saturday last month, a group of people were setting up microphones and handing out brightly colored whistles in Berlin's old Jewish quarter. They were preparing for a protest against neo-Nazi marchers who were en route to the neighborhood. Jorg Braunsdorf, a bookseller, rubbed his hands together to keep warm, as a local singer did a sound check. One man worried that the cold would keep fellow protesters away, but Mr. Braunsdorf was reassuring: ""It's also cold for them,"" he said, referring to the marchers who carry, among other banners, a German flag from the early 1930s. When right-wing extremists first marched in fall 2016 through the central Berlin neighborhood where Mr. Braunsdorf's independent bookshop, Tucholsky Bookstore, is, he and many of his customers were shocked and appalled. When they marched again last spring, Mr. Braunsdorf decided it was time to act.

By last summer, when a third march through this neighborhood was announced, the group was ready: They had teamed up with ""Berlin Against Nazis,"" a city-funded organization that targets racism and anti-Semitism. A friend of Mr. Braunsdorf's designed colorful posters and fliers and together they set up three protest stations along the marchers' route. Between 200 and 300 neighbors showed up with soup spoons, banging on pots and pans, to protest the march. ""We wanted to take back the public space,"" Mr. Braunsdorf recalled on a recent afternoon, between answering one customer's question about the literary structure of a young adult thriller, and warmly recommending a new novella to another. ""At a certain point, you just have to do something."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

In Germany, Mr. Braunsdorf's efforts are part of a long tradition in which bookstores play an active role in civil society, said Johanna Hahn, director of the German Association of Booksellers in Berlin and Brandenburg.

""The book industry has always reacted with great sensitivity to the political climate,"" she said, ""and bookstores are always a place where social change occurs."" In the 1970s at the height of the women's liberation movement, for example, Germany had large numbers of feminist bookstores. ""Now, the theme really seems to be freedom of speech, freedom of opinion. Look at America, look at Turkey -- this problem is all over the world."" In German bookstore circles, the topic of nationalism and fascism is particularly prominent now, Ms. Hahn added. This follows the rise of groups like the Patriotic Europeans Against the Islamization of the West and Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which won 12.6 percent of the national vote in September, making it the first far-right party to sit in Parliament in 60 years. ""In every book there's a new perspective,"" Ms. Hahn said, ""so bookstores automatically fall on the side of openness and diversity."" But how best to serve customers is up for debate. In one of several panels dealing with the topic at the Leipzig Book Fair in mid-March, some independent sellers said they refused to order books from far-right publishers, while others argued that it is important for customers to be able to stay informed. (There are certain titles that Mr. Braunsdorf does not stock. He may order from some right-wing publishers upon request, but will give the customer a piece of his mind on the topic, first.) Germany has a healthy number of independent bookstores, thanks largely to a German law that requires all booksellers to sell books at set prices. But Zoe Beck, co-founder of a group called Publishers Against the Right, worries that market-oriented chain stores have weakened bookstores' role as a place of political debate. ""What Jorg Braunsdorf is doing is something I find exemplary,"" wrote Ms. Beck, in an email. ""The need now is greater than ever."" For Mr. Braunsdorf, 58, social engagement has always been part of running a bookstore. Originally from Wetzlar, a small city in what was then West Germany, Mr. Braunsdorf started working in his 20s at a book collective there run by a group of his young left-wing friends. They did not do much business, but the shop was a meeting place for students and activists: There, they printed fliers decrying nuclear power plants or calling for affordable housing.

Today, 37 years later, Mr. Braunsdorf is still working at a bookstore, but now it's his own shop, in Berlin, and other political issues have come to the forefront. ""None of us expected that this confrontation with fascism would be so close at hand,"" he said, alluding to the AfD success in entering Parliament. ""I think in the next years we are going to need to not just protest 'against,' but really come up with a 'for.' What do we want, in our society?"" Mr. Braunsdorf, who has hosted German-Arabic reading events at his shop for refugee children and moderated debates about gentrification, the economy and politics, said he ""can't imagine running a bookstore just as a selling point.""

He is not alone. A similar bookstore-run political project made headlines this year, when Heinz Ostermann, who owns the bookstore Leporello in Berlin's working-class neighborhood of Neukolln, had his car set on fire, for the second time. He had started a local group in 2016 dedicated to fighting the far right. ""There's a lot of solidarity,"" said Mr. Ostermann, who added that the attacks, suspected to have been carried out by local right-wing extremists, have not dissuaded him. ""I think people in the neighborhood are happy I'm here."" The same could be said of Mr. Braunsdorf. Last month, as the crowd of protesters grew, Ralf Teepe expressed his appreciation for Mr. Braunsdorf's bookstore, which he said he visited once a week, in lieu of church, for spiritual enrichment. Mr. Teepe, a civil servant with the foreign service who recently moved back to Berlin after years in Africa and elsewhere, had joined Mr. Braunsdorf a few blocks from the bookstore. He too wanted to protest the neo-Nazis who were headed to the neighborhood. ""I was born in '58, and both of my parents were marked by the Nazi period,"" Mr. Teepe said. ""The older I get, the more I understand how traumatized my father, in particular, was."" He paused to rub his hands together and blow on them for warmth. ""Today, 70 years later, you have the feeling for the first time that history could repeat itself. That that's not out of the question.""",Local bookstores in Germany have a tradition of playing an active role in civil society.

Global Business,"China Is Poised to Raise Rates Again, Bankers Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/global/02yuan.html,"HONG KONG  China's government, increasingly worried about soaring inflation, plans to continue tightening its money supply and will probably raise interest rates again within the month. That is the forecast of economists and bankers with knowledge of policy makers' views, who insisted on anonymity because of the political and diplomatic sensitivity of Chinese monetary policy. Inflation lately has caused friction in China's mighty export machine. Now, Beijing's efforts to fight inflation, through higher interest rates and tighter restrictions on bank loans, could begin to slow segments of China's domestic economy slightly  particularly the breakneck pace of investment in new factories, office buildings and apartment complexes. That, in turn, could weaken demand for industrial materials like steel and copper that depend heavily on Chinese purchases.

And yet, the tighter-money policies and higher interest rates could be good news for Chinese consumers, whose spending China has been counting on for its next wave of growth  not only to help balance the country's export-dominated economy but to enable more of the nation's 1.3 billion citizens to share in its prosperity. For one thing, a slowdown in speculative construction could slow or even temporarily reverse the long rise of Chinese real estate prices, as 15 million people a year pour into the cities. And while much of the construction spending, and the loans that fuel it, involve state-owned companies, households in China are typically savers, not borrowers. They pay for most cars and other large purchases with cash. Even for new homes, they typically borrow half or less of the purchase price. So far, consumers frequently hold large bank deposits that earn interest rates well below the inflation rate. Higher interest on savings accounts, if the new policies allow, would only improve consumer purchasing power.

Much of China's inflation is being fueled by the extraordinary growth in its money supply, broadly measured as so-called M2, which has soared a total of nearly 53 percent in the last two years. That is largely a result of the country's aggressive monetary and fiscal stimulus program in 2009 and early 2010, as Beijing essentially printed money in response to the global financial crisis. Although China's economy is a little less than half that of the United States, its money supply is now one-quarter larger than America's. Since the beginning of last year, Beijing has moved several times to start clamping back down on the money in circulation, by increasing the required amounts that banks must hold in reserve, leaving them with less money to lend. The central bank has raised this requirement seven times in the last 13 months, with four of those increases coming in quick succession since mid-November. The bank has also been raising interest rates. The benchmark rate for one-year corporate loans is now 5.81 percent, up from 5.31 percent a year ago. The central bank has already raised rates twice since late October, and is poised to raise them again this month, the economists and bankers said.

China's consumer price index climbed 4.6 percent last year. But Chinese and Western economists say the index seriously underestimates inflation because of shortcomings in how it measures the introduction of new garments and other goods and because it entirely excludes the cost of owner-occupied housing. The National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing has said it is working on improving the index. One policy change Beijing is unlikely to take soon is letting the currency, the renminbi, appreciate faster as a way to fight inflation, the economists and bankers said. The renminbi has already been rising at an annualized rate of 5.7 percent against the dollar since China broke the currency's peg to the dollar last June. China's central bank continues to intervene heavily in currency markets to brake the renminbi's rise, but not enough to stop the renminbi from rising altogether  as it did for almost two years before last June. The Obama administration, arguing that an artificially low renminbi gave Chinese exporters an unfair price advantage over Western companies, pushed China hard a year ago to break the link to the dollar. But Washington has been slightly less vocal on the subject more recently. It barely came up in public comments by either side after President Hu Jintao of China's recent state visit to the White House. Lately, Chinese and American policy makers have been looking at the so-called real effective exchange rate, which includes differences in the two countries' inflation levels. Inflation in the United States is currently running at a rate of only about 1.5 percent. Depending on which inflation index is chosen in each country, and whether any adjustments are made for the consistent underestimates of Chinese inflation because of methodology problems, the real effective exchange rate measure shows that the renminbi is strengthening by 10 percent or more a year against the dollar.","A tighter monetary policy would cause segments of China's economy to slow slightly, but would be good news for Chinese consumers, because of their high savings rate.",5a30f00d-6baf-57b7-a67b-0f51f47ee260,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/02/business/2YUAN/2YUAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=ae39cb737b513170b5de9762d38ed6c01872ae3ab2ffa3f1b1db2dc918130742&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,China is trying to rein in rapidly rising bank lending that has paid for a surge in construction.,5a30f00d-6baf-57b7-a67b-0f51f47ee260,N24News/imgs/5a30f00d-6baf-57b7-a67b-0f51f47ee260.jpg,24

Education,Clarity and Confusion From Tuition Calculators,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/education/college-cost-calculators-offer-clarity-and-confusion.html,"The annual ritual of college admissions has shifted from the season of applying to the season of waiting. While that means an anxious vigil for millions of teenagers like Zachary Ewell, it goes double for their parents. Heidi and Mike Ewell must wait not only to learn where Zachary will go, but also how many thousands of dollars they will have to pay. Zachary, a senior at Oak Park and River Forest High School near Chicago, and his parents have a new window into college pricing that millions of families before them did not. Federal rules require colleges to provide online calculators that generate a personalized estimate of the net price of attendance, based on answers to a series of questions about a family's finances. Many families are approaching these new tools with caution, however, finding that they vary widely in thoroughness and clarity. Moreover, there is no publicly available information for gauging how accurate they are. In addition, college administrators say that low-income families, in particular, often do not know that the net-price calculators exist. And even many financially and technically savvy upper-middle-class parents like the Ewells have made limited use of the calculators.

""We didn't have a lot of confidence that those were real numbers,"" said Ms. Ewell, a sales manager. ""They're all so different, and it seemed like there were such wide ranges and so many caveats that it really didn't feel apples-to-apples."" Sending children to college is one of the biggest financial commitments a family makes, yet historically, parents and students had no way to predict the cost before they applied. Informed consumers have long understood that the ""sticker price"" -- now hovering around $60,000 at some private colleges -- was often far more than what a family would have to pay. But until a student applied, was accepted and received a firm offer of financial aid, many found it hard to get even a rough idea of the actual price. Net-price calculators, which federal officials began to require colleges to offer in October 2011, have forced open what had been a locked door, giving families an idea of what colleges would charge them. ""It's a relatively new tool,"" with flaws, inconsistencies and growing pains, but ""just having them is a huge step in the right direction,"" said Lauren Asher, president of the Institute for College Access and Success, a nonprofit research and advocacy group that recently published a report saying that too many of the calculators are hard to find on college Web sites, and hard to use. College administrators say that their calculators draw significant traffic, but that many people start the process of entering their information but do not finish, or have trouble making sense of the calculators. Others simply do not know whether to trust the results.

""We looked at one or two, but we haven't been using them,"" said Eric L. Conley, whose daughter, Cydney, is also a senior at Oak Park and River Forest. ""Mostly, we ask them in person about costs when we're on campus visits."" Experts caution against putting much stock in relatively small differences between different college calculators' cost projections; the colleges stress that the results are nonbinding estimates. But in broad terms, they say, if used carefully, the calculators allow rough comparisons. They also reveal patterns that are familiar to people in higher education, but may come as a surprise to others, like the fact that the most prestigious private colleges, which usually have the largest endowments, generally offer more aid and lower net prices than well-regarded but less-wealthy private colleges, especially for families with above-average incomes; or that some colleges tilt their generosity toward the lower end of the income scale, and others toward the upper-middle range. Most important to selective private colleges, the calculators show that for all but high-income families, a well-endowed private college can be as affordable as a top state university. ""We still face a huge barrier of low-income families and first-generation college students not realizing that they can attend a school like Brown, in many cases, for less money than their local public college,"" said James Tilton, director of financial aid at Brown University. A 2008 federal law requires all colleges that participate in federal student aid programs to post net-price calculators on their Web sites. The Department of Education laid out a short list of required features and designed a template for a simple calculator, which many public colleges use. But colleges have wide latitude to take other factors into account, design their own calculators and ask far more questions. Some colleges build their own calculators. Others use calculators from private companies, customized extensively to each college's needs. One used by about 300 colleges was created by the College Board, the company that produces the SAT and other tests, and allows a family to check on multiple colleges without entering financial information more than once.

The result is a fairly bewildering array of possibilities, with potentially troubling inconsistencies. Just answering the most important basic question -- how much a family earns -- can be baffling. Some calculators want all wages included, others exclude money set aside for 401(k) or I.R.A. plans, and others ask for adjusted gross income. It is not always clear which figure the college wants, and the distinctions may be unfamiliar to the people filling out the forms. Many colleges insist on a specific income figure, but some -- mostly state colleges -- ask for ranges, making the results less precise. For example, the University of Michigan's calculator produces a net price range, which can be more than $10,000 wide. When a calculator presents a financial aid figure, it can be labeled a grant, a gift or a scholarship, depending on the college. For low- or moderate-income students, some colleges specify that the aid includes government grants, while others do not, implying that all of the aid would come from the college. Some calculators also muddy the distinction between a grant, a loan the student must repay and money a student must earn at a work-study job. A few colleges, like New York University and the University of Miami, appear not to have updated their calculators for the 2012-13 school year. Some calculators do not work if a student's parents are divorced. But the greatest variation is in the level of detail. That has implications for accuracy, because colleges' financial aid applications and formulas often take into account much more data than their online calculators. ""I always advise that the more questions that are asked on the net-price calculator, the more precise the answer you're going to get,"" said Myra Baas Smith, executive director of financial aid services at the College Board.","How much does that college really cost? Colleges are now required to have online calculators to help answer that question, but they pose some challenges.",c79f042b-67f4-5abe-a1a6-7ec537dcadb3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/16/us/COSTS/COSTS-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=380&w=600&s=1006bce8f88bb01b2c6c9ec0e14a33b808f44765fc53aacdb7453fa4ed52fad3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mike, Zachary and Heidi Ewell at home in River Forest, Ill.

'VERTIGO' at the Metrograph (April 1, 2 and 4). Even though experts selected Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 masterpiece as the greatest film of all time in Sight & Sound magazine's decennial poll, there is considerable controversy over the best way to see it. Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz, in their 1996 restoration, brought the film to a new generation with glorious 70-millimeter prints, but they were criticized for the choices they made with the soundtrack. The 2013 digital restoration looks way too sharp to my eye. (And how can a movie intended for film projection be ""restored"" to digital?) If you really want to see ""Vertigo"" as original audiences saw it, you have to catch it in I.B. Technicolor, an obsolete 35-millimeter process in which colors were applied directly to film prints using dyes, yielding rich images that have barely faded over time. The Metrograph offers purists a chance to see ""Vertigo"" in this format starting on Sunday.

Technology,"Ransomware Attacks Grow, Crippling Cities and Businesses",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/technology/ransomware-attacks.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- New Orleans's city government crippled. A maritime cargo facility temporarily closed. Hospitals forced to turn away patients. Small businesses shuttered. The cause in each of these incidents: ransomware attacks. In recent years, hackers have taken to locking down entire computer networks and demanding payments to let users back into their systems. The frequency of ransomware attacks -- among the scariest and most costly online assaults -- has been hard to pinpoint because many victims quietly pay off their attackers without notifying the authorities. Now, an array of new data provides perhaps the best available picture of the problem. In 2019, 205,280 organizations submitted files that had been hacked in a ransomware attack -- a 41 percent increase from the year before, according to information provided to The New York Times by Emsisoft, a security firm that helps companies hit by ransomware.

The average payment to release files spiked to $84,116 in the last quarter of 2019, more than double what it was the previous quarter, according to data from Coveware, another security firm. In the last month of 2019, that jumped to $190,946, with several organizations facing ransom demands in the millions of dollars. Security experts say that even these numbers underestimate the true cost of ransomware attacks, which have disrupted factories and basic infrastructure and forced businesses to shut down.

""Anything of value that is smart and connected can be compromised and held for ransom,"" said Steve Grobman, the chief technology officer at McAfee. ""If critical infrastructure systems are held for ransom, what is our policy going to be for dealing with those?"" The data from the security companies and the number of recent ransomware incidents show a dramatic escalation for a type of attack that, just a few years ago, was mostly directed at individuals, who had to pay only a few hundred dollars to get their files back.

The Coast Guard said in December that ransomware had forced a cargo transfer facility to shut for more than 30 hours after attackers took control of ""the industrial control systems that monitor and control cargo transfer and encrypted files critical to process operations."" The Coast Guard did not reveal the location of the facility. The city of New Orleans, one of dozens of cities hit by ransomware over the last year, was attacked with similar ransomware late last year and is still conducting many operations on paper, with police officers recording incidents manually. Cities appeared to be high on the target list because they are among the only victims who have to report the attacks. In reality, public sector organizations represented only around 10 percent of all victims last year, Coveware said.

Barclays and several other banks are still unable to make foreign currency conversions for customers more than a month after Travelex, the company that provides them with cash, was targeted by ransomware known as Sodinokibi, or REvil. The BBC reported that the hackers demanded $6 million. Ransomware attacks have also caused a number of small and medium businesses to shut altogether, like Colorado Timberline, a printing company with a few hundred employees near Denver, and Brookside ENT and Hearing Services in Battle Creek, Mich., a 10-person medical office. ""I was suddenly retired and I didn't want to be,"" said Dr. William Scalf, one of two doctors at Brookside, which closed in April after failing to recover its medical files from hackers who demanded $6,500.

American authorities have not released statistics on the broad changes in ransomware attacks, but the F.B.I. noted in its latest warning that the attacks were becoming ""more targeted, sophisticated, and costly."" The agency said an online portal for reporting incidents received 1,493 reports in 2018. But officials think that number was likely ""artificially low"" because it did not include reports from field offices or agents or any number of other sources. ""What we find most concerning is that it causes not just direct costs, but also indirect costs of lost operations,"" said Herbert Stapleton, cybersection chief at the F.B.I. ""We certainly view it as one of the most serious cybercriminal problems we face right now.""

Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, has gone further, calling ransomware the ""most widespread and financially damaging form of cyberattack."" ""We have had success stories, but to be honest, it is becoming more and more complicated,"" said Fernando Ruiz, acting head of Europol's European Cybercrime Center. ""This is a garden for them, and we need to change that."" Government authorities and security experts say the problem will get worse before it gets any better. In the last month, two security firms have identified a new form of ransomware, known as Snake or Ekans, that appears to be focused on freezing the software responsible for industrial processes at big oil and petroleum companies.

The assailants carrying out ransomware attacks have proved hard to identify because the technology they use, like Bitcoin and anonymous messaging platforms, allows them to communicate and transact with victims without being easily tracked. Many of the criminals operate from countries outside the reach of American law. The Justice Department has indicted hackers in Iran, North Korea and Russia, but none appear to face any threat of extradition. American authorities have suggested that several of these attackers have operated with the protection of their governments, and have helped their governments by passing along hacked files. Security experts said ransomware has evolved into an industry, with hundreds of gangs vying for the most lucrative victims. Some hackers have specialized in ""ransomware as a service,"" writing the victim-facing software and selling it to others through the so-called dark web. They have even built out customer-service centers to deal with victims and their payments. In recent attacks, the hackers often spent months quietly scouting out the innards of the computer networks of potential victims to ensure they have every important file tied up. They are often eager to prove to victims that they will return the files when they are paid, to ensure a prompt transaction. When victims don't pay, some gangs have begun publicly releasing private files to ratchet up the pressure -- as was the case with Southwire, one of the world's largest electrical wire and cable manufacturers that operates out of Georgia. Southwire filed a lawsuit against its attackers, unknown hackers, asking for the site where the company's files had been published be taken down. But the hackers soon moved their operations to a new site and released even more files.

Law enforcement officials have warned against giving attackers more confidence that they will get paid. But the attacks have become widespread enough -- and the ransom payments frequent enough -- that cybersecurity insurance rates are rising. Ransom costs aside, the worst outcomes can come when dealing with gangs that wipe the files they locked down. The medical practice that Dr. Shayla Kasel had built over 20 years in Simi Valley, Calif., was hit last August by ransomware. After her malpractice insurance connected her with a ransom negotiator and a forensic expert, she was told that even if she paid $50,000 for each of the digital keys that could unlock her different servers, there was only a 15 percent chance she would get her files back. Dr. Kasel said she limped along for a few weeks, seeing the patients who happened to come through her door and recording everything on paper. But she ultimately decided it wasn't worth trying to rebuild her files and business from scratch and risk facing lawsuits and fines. She shuttered her practice in December after incurring around $55,000 in expenses.",Hackers are locking people out of their networks and demanding big payments to get back in.

Your Money,Footsteps to Follow in the Coming Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/31/your-money/financial-footsteps-to-follow-in-the-coming-year.html,"Kathleen Rehl, a financial planner in Land O'Lakes, Fla., plans to redirect her time in 2012 so that she can reach many more people than the 55 or so clients she regularly works with.

One of the best, most revelatory money maxims is one that comes from Tim Maurer, an author, radio host and financial planner in Hunt Valley, Md. Personal finance is more personal than it is finance. Strip away the numbers and the returns and the 50-page financial plans, and what you're left with is people and all of their associated baggage. It is their raw emotions -- fear, greed, guilt -- that drive most financial decisions for better or (frequently) for worse. So this column is by the people -- the most interesting ones who turned up in the Your Money column and the stand-alone reports we co-produced with American Public Media's Marketplace Money radio show in 2011. And it's for the people who have set a personal goal in 2012 to do just a bit more to keep their emotions in check and their money under control.

This is how some of those characters from columns past intend to do it. DEBT When we last met Mino Caulton, a 19-year-old in Shutesbury, Mass., he was weighing financial aid offers from a variety of expensive universities. He ultimately decided to attend none for the foreseeable future. Though his family was able to demonstrate a great deal of need during the financial aid application process, even the local state university was going to cost them $2,000 out of pocket and require $7,000 in student loans in Year One.

""I heard that and got this aching, stabbing pain in my forehead,"" he said. ""I definitely think it's a stupid idea to get into debt when I don't have to."" Rather than blindly following his high school classmates heading immediately to college, he spent much of 2011 focusing on two areas of career interest. He works for his local fire department and recently completed his probationary period. And he coached a local soccer team. In the spring, he hopes to take an emergency medical technician course at the local community college, which would cost him nothing; he qualifies for free tuition.

Mr. Caulton knows that to advance in coaching in particular, he'll probably need a college degree. But he's in no rush to get one, especially if it means putting himself five figures in the hole. More high school graduates should be thinking precisely as he does, testing their career interests, dipping a toe in community college and living at home to keep debt at a minimum. UNEXPECTED EXPENSES For people who do graduate with debt, being mindful of expenses is crucial. Michaela Fortin, 22, is one of the luckiest recent college graduates in that respect. She has a job as a sales and marketing coordinator for the Middlebury Inn in Middlebury, Vt., that allows her to afford her $320 in monthly loan payments. And she has training, having worked as senior peer adviser at her alma mater, Champlain College in Burlington, Vt., as part of the college's personal finance training program, which every student must complete. What she didn't have until this year, however, was much real-world experience. And it was a bit like having cold water splashed in her face. ""Being unable to predict the unexpected has been the biggest challenge,"" she said. There were big things, like the need for a car, which then needed new tires. And little things, like the fees for the birth certificate and a replacement Social Security card she needed to start her job.

""I want to budget for savings, saving before I have the money,"" she said, in effect tricking her mind into thinking that the money was never available for everyday spending in the first place. BETTER HALVES To be an entrepreneur is to break many of the rules of personal finance. It means making a big bet. It can mean a lot of credit card debt, too, as Mike Alfred discovered. He is a co-founder of BrightScope, a company that ranks and provides data on 401(k) plans and investment advisers, and he recently finished paying off about $50,000 of that debt. It can also mean blowing off retirement savings for a while. Putting away $10,000 a year is fine, but most people in start-ups figure it's best to put all their available cash into the business in the hope they can sell it later for enough to retire on right then and there. Here, Mr. Alfred diverts from the standard all-in strategy as he recently began saving in his own company's retirement plan. In one sense, this may be about perceptions -- it might not look so good if Mr. 401(k) was not participating in his own retirement plan. Mike Alfred is investing in his firm's 401(k). Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times But Mr. Alfred, 30, chalks this up to something else -- the fact that his girlfriend moved to San Diego this year so the two could move in together. ""When you get older, you may have a spouse or significant other that is more conservative than you,"" he said. ""And you need to make sure that they feel comfortable building a relationship with a risk-taker. It is a little bit of a compromise, and she convinced me to start again."" Alan Wenker, the 48-year-old controller in Maplewood, Minn., who spent a decade hunting for a better 401(k) plan for himself and his co-workers, plans to spend part of 2012 putting things in better order in the event that he dies unexpectedly.

""My wife could find all of the stuff she needed by digging around in a file cabinet and piecing it all together,"" he said. ""But it really shouldn't be something that should be that hard to get."" So he's committing to making a better just-in-case spreadsheet in 2012, one with all of the relevant accounts and phone numbers on it. ""These are the easiest things in the world to put off,"" he said. TIME Kathleen Rehl, 64, a financial planner in Land O'Lakes, Fla., has devoted much of the latter part of her professional life to helping women who have already lost their spouses. In 2012, she plans to redirect her time so that she can reach many more people than the 55 or so clients she regularly works with. Time is money, true, but how you spend that time also contributes to your overall happiness. So she will meet with her clients twice instead of three times and help them via phone at other times, as needed.

CHILDREN It is hard to say no to your children, especially bright and ambitious teenagers with potentially enriching, but incredibly expensive, educational goals. For Mr. Wenker, it's the desire of his eldest child to study abroad while still in high school, before college tuition bills even hit, that inspired another goal for next year. What he realized was that the bill for this, if she ultimately decides to go, could allow for a teaching moment for both of his children. He is a bit of a thrift shop junkie, and there are many good ones near his office. Meanwhile, for years, he's been collecting vintage backpacking equipment and has a basement stuffed full of it. So the plan for 2012 is to make a family business of selling some of some of his finds on eBay. The children can do the photography. He'll write the listings, and his wife can handle shipping. ""The kids will get some idea of what it takes to do these things, to start a spreadsheet showing revenue and going from there,"" he said, figuring that the family could clear $5,000 or more for the overseas tuition if everyone is reasonably diligent. ""Then all we have to do is drop her off at the airport and sob uncontrollably,"" he said. ""Other than the heartache, it's all manageable.""",A column that catches up with people who faced financial turning points in 2011.,1b1a661c-1cde-5b08-aba3-c3f7daa49a9f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/12/31/your-money/31money-span/31money-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=6d891b70b412f04a66f7489ef128bb73cc568e1db5b25a17d9b64d3efaeacced&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Kathleen Rehl, a financial planner in Land O'Lakes, Fla.,  plans to redirect her time in 2012 so that she can reach many more people than the 55 or so clients she regularly works with.",1b1a661c-1cde-5b08-aba3-c3f7daa49a9f,N24News/imgs/1b1a661c-1cde-5b08-aba3-c3f7daa49a9f.jpg,21
Media,'American Idol' Is Coming Back to Television,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/09/business/media/american-idol-abc.html,"""American Idol,"" the genre-shattering singing competition show that went off the air just a year ago, because of falling ratings, is coming back to television on ABC. The network said on Tuesday morning on ""Good Morning America'' that it would revive the former Fox hit sometime during the 2017-18 television season. ABC did not name a host or say who the judges would be. Ryan Seacrest, the longtime host of ""American Idol,"" joined ABC and Disney's syndicated morning show, ""Live,"" last week. The revival of ""American Idol"""" is a head-spinning move, even by the standards of broadcast networks desperately searching for a hit. But these are tough times in broadcast television: In the last three years, ratings among adults under 50 have declined 24 percent.

""American Idol,"" which debuted in 2002, was a once- dominant ratings player for Fox, and the standard-bearer for a wave of amateur talent shows that followed it. But over its last few seasons -- as it cycled through judges, and as rival shows like ""The Voice"" slowed its momentum -- the show's audience collapsed. Fox announced it was ending the ""American Idol"" run two years ago, and the final episode was in April 2016. Few were surprised when the decision was announced. But since then, as ratings have plunged, the big four networks have turned to reboots in the hopes of regaining viewers. Fox, in particular, has brought back shows like ""24,"" ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""Prison Break"" to fill the ""American Idol"" gap. Fox is hardly alone in the revival mania. ""Will and Grace"" returns to NBC in the fall; ""Roseanne"" is probably coming back on the air with ABC at some point in the next television season; and CBS made versions of ""Training Day"" and ""MacGyver"" this past season. Even ""Love Connection"" is being revived, with Andy Cohen serving as host on a Fox reboot.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. But those shows -- or the movie revivals -- had been dormant for years. Though series like ""Nashville"" and ""The Mindy Project"" were canceled by network TV and found new life elsewhere (on CMT and Hulu), it is exceedingly rare for a network show to return this quickly on a rival network. ABC made the decision to bring back ""American Idol"" just a week before its annual upfront presentation, a meticulously devised showcase for advertisers on which a network announces its fall lineup.

""'American Idol' is a pop culture staple that left the air too soon,"" said Channing Dungey, president of ABC Entertainment. ""ABC is the right home to reignite the fan base."" Until a few weeks ago, NBC was also in negotiations for ""American Idol."" But ABC ultimately won the rights from the show's producers, FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, which is part of the CORE Media Group. At its height, ""American Idol"" was one of the most dominant shows in television. It was a ratings force that sometimes drew more than 30 million viewers a night -- the sort of numbers that only playoff football games get these days. It was also a juggernaut for the music industry and a path to career success for aspiring singers -- to be minted on ""American Idol,"" like Carrie Underwood, was a path to becoming a star. Still, ""American Idol"" averaged more than 11 million viewers in its final season, a respectable showing, and was one of the top-rated shows among adults under 50, according to Nielsen's delayed-viewing data. Whether those numbers are sustainable, or if more people were tuning in because it was in its final season, will soon be determined. It was only a year ago that Simon Cowell, now a host on ""America's Got Talent,"" suggested that his failed ""American Idol"" follow-up act, ""The X-Factor,"" could have survived the current TV climate, if given more time and if judged by the standard of just how far TV ratings have fallen. ""We treated it as a failure,"" Mr. Cowell said. ""I wasn't aware the market had gone down to that level so quickly. I was in this La-La Land head space of 30 or 40 million, and I thought 12 million feels terrible.""","ABC announced that it would revive the old Fox hit, which was canceled because of falling ratings, sometime during the 2017-18 television season.",2058959e-61c7-572a-8530-88c022dab450,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/09/arts/10idol/10idol-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2710c4ae1a7d16fb2617547a8b110071e3fd1c55b6cd33fad136e367be41be65&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from the finale of ""American Idol"" last year.",2058959e-61c7-572a-8530-88c022dab450,N24News/imgs/2058959e-61c7-572a-8530-88c022dab450.jpg,16
Media,News Outlets Wonder Where the Predictions Went Wrong,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/business/media/news-outlets-wonder-where-the-predictions-went-wrong.html,"The country's major news organizations, as surprised as anybody by Donald J. Trump's ascension to the presidency, faced a question from their audiences on Wednesday that was laced with a sense of betrayal and anger: How did you get it so wrong? The question came in letters. (""To editors and writers of The NYT,"" one reader wrote, ""you were so wrong for so long. You misled your readers and were blinded by your own journalistic bigotry."") It came in Facebook posts. (""You were in a bubble and weren't paying attention to your fellow Americans,"" the filmmaker Michael Moore wrote in a post shared more than 100,000 times.) Most ominously, it came in the form of canceled subscriptions, something that will surely be monitored. After projecting a relatively easy victory for Hillary Clinton with all the certainty of a calculus solution, news outlets like The New York Times, The Huffington Post and the major networks scrambled to provide candid answers. With a new administration about to take shape in Washington, news executives tried to take stock of their mistakes and fix them on the fly, lest the fast-moving story leave them behind again.

Data journalism in particular, including websites like The Times's Upshot and The Huffington Post's Pollster, was under fire after guiding audiences -- often through visually appealing speedometer-type graphics that forecast the probability of winning -- to the conclusion that Mrs. Clinton would prevail in electoral votes. On Tuesday, the meters went haywire. The Times's Upshot graphic, for instance, moved from a high probability favoring Mrs. Clinton to a huge advantage for Mr. Trump, with readers left to guess what the dancing needle really signified. Though several national polls came close to capturing the final result in the popular vote -- which Mrs. Clinton appears likely to win when the counting is done -- all the number-crunching of state polls pointed to resounding success for Mrs. Clinton in the Electoral College. The news media's self-reflection on Wednesday brought to mind the awkward position Fox News found itself in four years ago, when it was criticized for creating an insular information bubble that led some viewers to believe Mitt Romney would defeat President Obama. That raised questions about Fox News's objectivity. Now it is mainstream news outlets, which Fox News so often portrays as liberally biased, that are facing a wave of skepticism. In some cases, the questions come from people at Fox News. ""A lot of media outlets made a decision sometime after the convention that Donald Trump was beyond the pale and they no longer had to observe the normal rules of journalism and objectivity,"" Chris Wallace, a Fox News anchor, said in an interview on Tuesday. ""I thought The New York Times was one of the worst offenders,"" but, he added, ""we were all guilty -- myself included -- of kind of writing him off.""

Mr. Baquet praised his political team and other Times journalists for ""agility and creativity,"" citing articles about Mr. Trump's taxes and Mrs. Clinton's record in Libya. But in an interview in his office, he said, ""If I have a mea culpa for journalists and journalism, it's that we've got to do a much better job of being on the road, out in the country, talking to different kinds of people than the people we talk to -- especially if you happen to be a New York-based news organization -- and remind ourselves that New York is not the real world."" The NBC anchor Tom Brokaw echoed that sentiment, lamenting that for all its efforts at advancing diversity, the news media was still ""pretty confined"" to ""the Eastern Seaboard."" The sense of failure was not universal, with some news executives saying that journalists by and large did their job in presenting the news and leaving it to voters to decide.
* What happened on Day 2 of Elizabeth Holmes's testimony.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. ""You can't say that this campaign was undercovered or that this result is because of some failure to report on these candidates,"" said David Rhodes, the president of CBS News. ""I think it's presumptuous of anybody -- media or anybody else -- to suggest that the reason for the result is some information failure.""

That said, there was a widespread feeling that the coastal and Beltway sensibilities of many mainstream reporters left them unable to relate to the sense of anger and resentment of the core Trump voter, which led them to miss Mr. Trump's groundswell of support, some of which appeared to have been lost by polling, too. And it left them blind to the fact that the political rules to which they adhered no longer seemed to apply. Experience told them that Mr. Trump's misstatements, flaws and gaffes would prove disqualifying, which at times led them to present their journalism with a knowingness that only served to convince a large subset of voters that reporters, at best, didn't get them. At NBC News on Wednesday, sleep-deprived executives discussed how to redouble efforts to capture issues close to voters, at a time when institutions like the news media are not trusted by many Americans. ""We cannot go in there with a sense that we think we know better,"" said Phil Griffin, the president of MSNBC. ""I think that's often what happens in journalism: Some go in with a sense, from the experience they've had, that their reporting can anticipate things. We've got to go in with a total open mind."" Journalists are also operating in a new media world -- of Twitter, Facebook and the alt-right players who operate on the platforms -- in which they are no longer the center of gravity.

Data journalism outlets like The Upshot have provided news organizations with compelling content offering a different presentation of journalism that shows readers the great breadth of data that can illuminate public opinion. It also has the benefit of inducing them to click early and often. On The Times's home page, a standing Upshot feature regularly told readers that Mrs. Clinton was the odds-on favorite to win the Electoral College -- at times on the order of more than 90 percent -- when there were stand-alone head-to-head national polls that showed a harder-fought race and, in some cases, even a lead for Mr. Trump. Amanda Cox, the editor of The Upshot, said the model clearly indicated that Mrs. Clinton was the favorite based on polling data from several important states, including Wisconsin and Michigan. Ms. Cox said the mistake lay elsewhere; there was a ""failure of communication,"" she said, in telling readers what the numbers actually meant -- that probabilities are just that, probabilities, not guarantees. The Times did try -- for example, it translated the probability of Mrs. Clinton losing into the probability of missing certain field goals in football -- but Ms. Cox said there was a way to make the meaning of the numbers clearer. ""I think you could argue that there is room to improve how we communicate probability and uncertainty,"" she said. At Nate Silver's data website, FiveThirtyEight, he had predicted that Mrs. Clinton would win with more than 300 electoral votes, and gave her a 71 percent chance of winning with the site's polls-only prediction model. He also emphasized that Mr. Trump's chances were real, with analysis pieces predicting that Trump could win the presidency while losing the popular vote.","After projecting a relatively easy victory for Hillary Clinton with all the certainty of a calculus solution, major outlets scrambled to provide candid answers.",a8b545cd-14cb-5beb-94c0-5c3d467e88a5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/10/us/10MEDIA/10MEDIA-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=0431e6f7e8b9624c9bbd30f03a6268c6136d8533aa2e2b2682be76bb390034c7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Journalists at the New York Hilton Midtown in Manhattan before Donald J.

Health,U.S. Hospitals Wrestle With Shortages of Drug Supplies Made in Puerto Rico,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/23/health/puerto-rico-hurricane-maria-drug-shortage.html,"One of the workhorses of Clarke County Hospital, a 25-bed facility in rural Osceola, Iowa, is an unassuming product known as a Mini-Bag. It is a small, fluid-filled bag used by nurses to dilute drugs, like antibiotics, so that they can be dripped slowly into patients' veins. The bag's ease of use has made it popular in small facilities like Clarke County, where the pharmacy is closed on nights and weekends, as well as at nationally known hospitals like the Cleveland Clinic, which uses 34,000 of the bags every month. ""It's a safe, sterile, stable way to get medications to patients,"" said Michele Evink, the pharmacy manager at Clarke County Hospital.

The bag shortage is the most significant to be directly linked to the effects of the hurricane but others are likely to follow. In addition to creating a humanitarian crisis on the island, the storm knocked out production at the Puerto Rican factories that make vital drugs, medical devices and medical supplies that are used around the world. Some device and supply companies have already begun limiting shipments of certain items from the island, ranging from mesh for repairing hernias to surgical scalpels and tools used in orthopedic surgery. On Monday, Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, questioned companies' statements that their plants were back in operation: ""We understand that manufacturing is running at minimal levels, and certainly far from full production,"" Dr. Gottlieb said in prepared remarks published Monday by the House Energy and Commerce Committee. He is scheduled to be questioned by the committee on Tuesday. In his prepared statement, Dr. Gottlieb said many plants are running at below 50 percent capacity, ""with many firms operating around 20 percent capacity, and some even less. We have found no firm operating above 70 percent of their normal operation.""

Pharmaceutical products made in Puerto Rico account for nearly 10 percent of all drugs consumed by Americans, and about 80 firms make medical products there, the F.D.A. has said. ""I don't think we've dealt with a situation where we've had so many simultaneous impacts to what are very important facilities,"" Dr. Gottlieb said. So far, ""we have been able to mitigate these issues, but it's been all hands on deck at the F.D.A., and there's been close calls."" Dr. Gottlieb says the F.D.A. is watching the supply of about 30 drugs that are made on the island, in addition to medical devices. Most companies are still running on diesel generators, and manufacturers that have been able to connect to the power grid are still encountering an unpredictable supply of electricity, he said. Cathy Denning, the senior vice president of sourcing operations at Vizient, which negotiates with medical companies on behalf of its member hospitals, said several device manufacturers, including Medtronic, which makes surgical staples, and Stryker, which makes orthopedic surgery products, were shipping reduced supplies of some products to hospitals because of Hurricane Maria. ""We here at Vizient had an 'aha' moment when we realized how much manufacturing actually takes place in Puerto Rico,"" she said. Last week, a Johnson & Johnson executive told investors that the company couldn't rule out ""intermittent"" shortages of some formulations of its products, although he noted that many were made elsewhere. Johnson & Johnson makes Tylenol and the H.I.V. drug Prezista in Puerto Rico, as well as other products. Soon after the storm, Johnson & Johnson Vision informed customers that a product used in cataract surgery might go into short supply, according to Vizient. A spokesman for Johnson & Johnson said production of the product has resumed, but that it has not yet been shipped from Puerto Rico.

The F.D.A. has been supplying logistical help to companies, providing fuel for the generators and assisting with moving finished products off the island. Dr. Gottlieb said some companies had gotten down to a 24-hour supply of diesel fuel, and representatives for the medical-device industry had said some generators were beginning to break down, requiring emergency repair. Pharmacists at half a dozen hospitals, from Utah to North Carolina, said in interviews that the fluid bag shortage had had a domino effect, leading to scarcities of a range of products as administrators race to stock up on the supplies they need to keep their hospitals running smoothly. Even products like empty bags and plastic tubing, which are also made by Baxter in Puerto Rico, have been hard to come by, some said. ""With drug shortages, it is often a race to see who can find a supply of the drug on shortage and also any alternatives,"" said Philip J. Trapskin, who is the program manager of medication use strategy and innovation at UW Health, the University of Wisconsin-Madison's health system. ""We have been able to get what we need to avoid disruptions in patient care, but the mix of products is not ideal and there are no guarantees we will continue to get the supplies we need."" Baxter recently announced that the F.D.A. had allowed it to import bags from the company's factories in Ireland and Australia, and said production in Puerto Rico was slowly resuming. The company, which is based in Deerfield, Ill., said it was also helping its employees on the island, including distributing generators and propane-powered cooktops for the workers' use. ""While the storm devastated the island in a day, the recovery will take time,"" the company said in a statement. Baxter did not provide a timeline for when the bags would be back in stock, and pharmacists said they anticipated that the bags might not be available for many more weeks or months. ""This is a big deal for hospitals across the country,"" said Scott Knoer, the chief pharmacy officer at the Cleveland Clinic. ""We're really still trying to get the information we need to manage it.""

Baxter has been rationing its supply, shipping limited orders of the bags filled with saline and dextrose to hospitals based on a percentage of what the institutions typically use. ""We are getting small amounts, but it is nowhere what we need in order to take care of patients,"" said Jeff Rosner, who oversees pharmacy contracting and purchasing at the Cleveland Clinic. The impact has rippled throughout the clinic's normal operations. Alternatives, such as injecting some drugs into an IV -- known as an ""IV push"" -- take more time for nurses, which divert them from attending to other needs. And the method is not appropriate for some drugs. ""This has repercussions,"" Mr. Knoer said. The pharmacists said the shortage had not yet affected patient care, although some of the alternatives require that employees learn new systems or adopt complex practices that can introduce human error. If the shortage persists, some said elective procedures, like knee replacements, might be postponed. It is a predicament that is all too familiar. While Hurricane Maria caused the latest problem, drug shortages have plagued the nation's hospital system for years. The affected products are typically longstanding staples, like epinephrine or morphine, and are often sterile injectable drugs that sell for low profit margins. In 2014, a shortage of large saline bags, which were manufactured by Baxter and are not currently scarce, led to state and federal investigations into its business practices. Even the Mini-Bags have previously been in short supply, and pharmacists said shipments of the small bags had been unpredictable before the hurricane. ""It's like, do we have any great faith this company is going to be able to turn this shortage around, when they haven't been able to effectively turn around the shortages they had in existence before?"" said Debby Cowan, the pharmacy manager at Angel Medical Center, a small hospital in Franklin, in North Carolina's Smoky Mountains. Like Dr. Gottlieb, many of the hospital administrators said their eye was on the horizon. With so many drug companies manufacturing products in Puerto Rico, Mr. Rosner said, ""I am fearful that this may not be the end of the shortages -- it may only be the beginning.""",Officials warn that Hurricane Maria's effects on manufacturing on the island may be long-lasting.,2446d155-18f9-5df6-8b19-205a0668754d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/21/science/21SHORTAGES1/21SHORTAGES1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=643ace557e9a30b2c932c024b2f6d351176227d150ff1a9f149d0eba7adfa4bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michele M.

Education,How Big-Time Sports Ate College Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/education/edlife/how-big-time-sports-ate-college-life.html,"IT was a great day to be a Buckeye. Josh Samuels, a junior from Cincinnati, dates his decision to attend Ohio State to Nov. 10, 2007, and the chill he felt when the band took the field during a football game against Illinois. ""I looked over at my brother and I said, 'I'm going here. There is nowhere else I'd rather be.' "" (Even though Illinois won, 28-21.) Tim Collins, a junior who is president of Block O, the 2,500-member student fan organization, understands the rush. ""It's not something I usually admit to, that I applied to Ohio State 60 percent for the sports. But the more I do tell that to people, they'll say it's a big reason why they came, too."" Ohio State boasts 17 members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, three Nobel laureates, eight Pulitzer Prize winners, 35 Guggenheim Fellows and a MacArthur winner. But sports rule. ""It's not, 'Oh, yeah, Ohio State, that wonderful physics department.' It's football,"" said Gordon Aubrecht, an Ohio State physics professor.

Last month, Ohio State hired Urban Meyer to coach football for $4 million a year plus bonuses (playing in the B.C.S. National Championship game nets him an extra $250,000; a graduation rate over 80 percent would be worth $150,000). He has personal use of a private jet. Dr. Aubrecht says he doesn't have enough money in his own budget to cover attendance at conferences. ""From a business perspective,"" he can see why Coach Meyer was hired, but he calls the package just more evidence that the ""tail is wagging the dog."" Dr. Aubrecht is not just another cranky tenured professor. Hand-wringing seems to be universal these days over big-time sports, specifically football and men's basketball. Sounding much like his colleague, James J. Duderstadt, former president of the University of Michigan and author of ""Intercollegiate Athletics and the American University,"" said this: ""Nine of 10 people don't understand what you are saying when you talk about research universities. But you say 'Michigan' and they understand those striped helmets running under the banner."" For good or ill, big-time sports has become the public face of the university, the brand that admissions offices sell, a public-relations machine thanks to ESPN exposure. At the same time, it has not been a good year for college athletics. Child abuse charges against a former Penn State assistant football coach brought down the program's legendary head coach and the university's president. Not long after, allegations of abuse came to light against an assistant basketball coach at Syracuse University. Combine that with the scandals over boosters showering players with cash and perks at Ohio State and, allegedly, the University of Miami and a glaring power gap becomes apparent between the programs and the institutions that house them. ""There is certainly a national conversation going on now that I can't ever recall taking place,"" said William E. Kirwan, chancellor of the University of Maryland system and co-director of the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics. ""We've reached a point where big-time intercollegiate athletics is undermining the integrity of our institutions, diverting presidents and institutions from their main purpose.""

The explosion in televised games has spread sports fever well beyond traditional hotbeds like Alabama and Ole Miss. Classes are canceled to accommodate broadcast schedules, and new research suggests that fandom can affect academic performance. Campus life itself revolves around not just going to games but lining up and camping out to get into them. ""It's become so important on the college campus that it's one of the only ways the student body knows how to come together,"" said Allen Sack, president-elect of the Drake Group, a faculty network that lobbies for academic integrity in college sports. ""In China and other parts of the world, there are no gigantic stadiums in the middle of campus. There is a laser focus on education as being the major thing. In the United States, we play football.""

Dr. Sack, interim dean of the University of New Haven's college of business, was sipping orange juice at a coffee shop a few blocks from the Yale Bowl. It was a fitting place to meet, given that when the Ivy League was formed in 1954, presidents of the eight member colleges saw where football was headed and sought to stop it. The pact they made, according to a contemporaneous account in The Harvard Crimson, aimed to ensure that players would ""enjoy the game as participants in a form of recreational competition rather than as professional performers in public spectacles."" There is nothing recreational about Division I football today, points out Dr. Sack, who played for Notre Dame in the 1960s. Since then, athletic departments have kicked the roof off their budgets, looking more like independent franchises than university departments.

It is that point -- ""this commercial thing"" in the middle of academia, as Charles T. Clotfelter, a public policy professor at Duke, put it -- that some believe has thrown the system out of kilter. In his recent book ""Big-Time Sports in American Universities,"" Dr. Clotfelter notes that between 1985 and 2010, average salaries at public universities rose 32 percent for full professors, 90 percent for presidents and 650 percent for football coaches. The same trend is apparent in a 2010 Knight Commission report that found the 10 highest-spending athletic departments spent a median of $98 million in 2009, compared with $69 million just four years earlier. Spending on high-profile sports grew at double to triple the pace of that on academics. For example, Big Ten colleges, including Penn State, spent a median of $111,620 per athlete on athletics and $18,406 per student on academics. Division I football and basketball, of course, bring in millions of dollars a year in ticket sales, booster donations and cable deals. Penn State football is a money-maker: 2010 Department of Education figures show the team spending $19.5 million and bringing in almost $73 million, which helps support 29 varsity sports. Still, only about half of big-time programs end up in the black; many others have to draw from student fees or the general fund to cover expenses. And the gap between top programs and wannabes is only growing with colleges locked into an arms race to attract the best coaches and build the most luxurious venues in hopes of luring top athletes, and donations from happy alumni. College sports doesn't just demand more and more money; it is demanding more attention from fans. Glen R. Waddell, associate professor of economics at the University of Oregon, wanted to know how much. In a study published last month as part of the National Bureau of Education Research working paper series, Oregon researchers compared student grades with the performance of the Fighting Ducks, winner of this year's Rose Bowl and a crowd pleaser in their Nike uniforms in crazy color combinations and mirrored helmets. ""Here is evidence that suggests that when your football team does well, grades suffer,"" said Dr. Waddell, who compared transcripts of over 29,700 students from 1999 to 2007 against Oregon's win-loss record. For every three games won, grade-point average for men dropped 0.02, widening the G.P.A. gender gap by 9 percent. Women's grades didn't suffer. In a separate survey of 183 students, the success of the Ducks also seemed to cause slacking off: students reported studying less (24 percent of men, 9 percent of women), consuming more alcohol (28 percent, 20 percent) and partying more (47 percent, 28 percent). While acknowledging a need for more research, Dr. Waddell believes the results should give campus leaders pause: fandom can carry an academic price. ""No longer can it be the case where we skip right over that inconvenience,"" he said.

""Big-time sports,"" Dr. Clotfelter said, ""have a real effect on the way people in universities behave."" AT Duke, one of the country's top universities, men's basketball sets the rhythms of campus life. Of 600 students who study abroad each year, only 100 do it in the spring. It probably doesn't need to be said, but you don't schedule anything opposite a basketball game. Ever. ""If there's a basketball game, you don't hold the meeting, you don't hold the event,"" said Larry Moneta, vice president for student affairs. Then there's the annual campout of 1,000 at Krzyzewski ville, the patch of grass named for Coach Mike Krzyzewski outside the hulking Gothic-style gymnasium, to determine the order of the line into the game against the rival University of North Carolina, which the Blue Devils host on March 3. Dr. Moneta several years ago stepped in to ban tents before the first day of classes after winter break (some had started the day after Christmas), but he has mostly ""let the students own this."" He was pleased when they decided tenting wouldn't start this year until a week later, Jan. 15. Tenters can sleep indoors when it's below 20 degrees or there is ""more than two inches of accumulated snow."" The rest of the time, students must prove their devotion (extra points for game attendance) and their residency (middle-of-the-night tent checks by ""line monitors"" signaled by a bullhorn). Even grad students hold their own campout, with 2,200 spending a weekend in tents and RVs to enter a lottery for season tickets; only 725 get lucky. It's become such a big deal that a law professor said they ""have to figure out when that is"" so as not to invite law firms to campus for interviews that weekend. While Dr. Moneta has ""concerns about occasional alcohol use and abuse"" among K-Ville undergrads (line monitors must intervene if they spot drinking games), he said students manage to camp out ""for the most part without any negative effect on academics."" Orin Starn, a Duke professor who is a longtime critic of its participation in Division I athletics, begs to differ. He objects to sports occupying ""this gigantic place in the university landscape."" He calls basketball ""a strain of anti-intellectualism"" that claims too much time and attention. But as an anthropologist -- he teaches ""Anthropology of Sports"" -- he understands why. ""It's like going to the Metropolitan Opera or the New York City Ballet,"" he said. ""It's a chance to see these incredible athletes and this legendary coach.""

Dr. Starn put a scholarly spin on it: ""Big-time sports have become a modern tribal religion for college students."" There are sacred symbols (team logos), a high priest (Coach K) and shared rituals (chants and face painting). ""This generation loves pageantry and tradition. School spirit is in right now. Now it's hip to be a joiner and it's hip to be a sports fan."" Also, he observed, ""these kids have grown up with the idea that sports are really a major part of American society and something they should care about."" Duke's game against North Carolina is special, but it doesn't take much to provoke a queue for men's basketball. At 8:50 a.m. one day last month, students gathered at K-Ville. It didn't matter that it was Wednesday, that the game wasn't for 10 hours, that it would rain (even pour), or that Daniel Carp and Matthew Grossman -- first in line -- had papers due (Mr. Carp on the religious indoctrination of children; Mr. Grossman about Kant and the boundaries of mere reason). The matchup against Colorado State wasn't even a compelling out-of-conference game. But the point was not just to be at the game but to befirst to enter Cameron Indoor Stadium, thereby securing the best seats in the famed student section. ""Every time they swipe my card and I go in, I get this overwhelming enthusiasm. 'I'm here! It's game time!'"" Mr. Grossman, a freshman from Atlanta, explained between bites of a burger topped with crumbled blue cheese after the game, blue and white paint still adorning his face. The rise of near-professional college sports has fueled the rise of near-professional fans. Mr. Carp, a freshman from Philadelphia sporting a No. 2 jersey, said that being a fan was integral to college life. ""You just learn really early on how to make going to basketball games part of your everyday routine.""

For a Tuesday night game against Duke in Columbus (for which there were enough seats, according to Mr. Collins, the Block O president), Ohio State students pitched tents along the outside wall of Schottenstein Center starting at 5 p.m. on a Sunday. ""I can imagine they may have neglected a class or two on Monday and Tuesday,"" Mr. Collins said. ""But we are here for four years. What will you remember 10 years from now, that you decided to write that English paper, or you had front row seats at the Duke game?"" Worry about students making that sort of academic tradeoff led officials at Indiana University, Bloomington, to cut short ""Camp Crean"" (after Coach Tom Crean) last month when students started lining up four days in advance for the Hoosiers basketball game against Kentucky. ""It's the week before finals, and we didn't want the kids camping out and staying up for days when it's going to be in the 20s and -- oh, by the way -- it's finals,"" said the university spokesman, Mark Land. While only ""a small number"" of students had started camping, Mr. Land noted, ""if you get hundreds out there, it's a party atmosphere."" TELEVISION has fed the popularity. The more professional big-time college sports has become, the more nonathletes have been drawn in, said Murray Sperber, author of ""Beer and Circus: How Big-Time College Sports Has Crippled Undergraduate Education."" ""Media coverage gets into kids' heads,"" he said, ""and by the time they are ready to choose a college, it becomes a much bigger factor than it was historically."" In the last 10 years, the number of college football and basketball games on ESPN channels rose to 1,320 from 491. This doesn't include games shown by competitors: the Big 10 Network, Fox, CBS/Turner, Versus and NBC. All that programming means big games scheduled during the week and television crews, gridlock and tailgating on campus during the school day. ""How can you have a Wednesday night football game without shutting down the university for a day or two?"" asked Dr. Sack of the Drake Group with a twinge of sarcasm. He's not exactly wrong, though. Last semester, the University of Central Florida canceled afternoon classes before the televised game against the University of Tulsa. Mississippi State canceled a day of classes before a Thursday night broadcast of a football game against Louisiana State, creating an online skirmish between Bulldog fans and a blogger who suggested parents should get their tuition back.

Even Boston College bowed, canceling afternoon classes because the football game against Florida State was on ESPN at 8 p.m. Janine Hanrahan, a Boston College senior, was so outraged at missing her political science class, ""Immigration, Processes and Policies,"" that she wrote an opinion piece headlined ""B.C.'s Backwards Priorities"" in the campus newspaper. ""It was an indication that football was superseding academics,"" she explained. (""We are the national role model,"" a university spokesman, Jack Dunn, responded. ""We are the school everyone calls to say, 'Where do you find the balance?' "") Universities make scheduling sacrifices not just for the lucrative contracts but also because few visuals build the brand better than an appearance on ESPN's road show ""College GameDay."" (In November, it had John L. Hennessey, president of Stanford, out on the Oval at daybreak working the crowd.) The school spirit conveyed by cheering thousands -- there were 18,000 on Francis Quadrangle at the University of Missouri, Columbia, on Oct. 23, 2010, for ""GameDay"" -- is a selling point to students choosing colleges. When Missouri first started recruiting in Chicago a decade ago, few prospective students had ever heard the university's nickname, ""Mizzou,"" according to the admissions director, Barbara Rupp. ""Now they know us by 'Mizzou,' "" thanks in part to ""GameDay."" ""I can't deny that,"" she said. Universities play the sports card, encouraging students to think of themselves as fans. A Vanderbilt admissions blog last fall featured ""My Vandy Fanatic Weekend"" describing the thrill of attending a basketball game and football game back to back. ""One of the things we hear in the admissions office is that students these days who are serious about academics are still interested in sports,"" said John Gaines, director of undergraduate admissions. Mr. Gaines slipped in that its academic competitor Washington University in St. Louis is only Division III. ""We always make sure we throw in a few crowd shots of people wearing black and gold"" during presentations. Imagine, he is saying, ""calling yourself a Commodore.""

What would balance really look like? Duke officials pride themselves in offering both an excellent education and a stellar sports program. Six years ago this spring, Duke experienced its own national scandal when three lacrosse players were accused of rape by a stripper hired for a party at the ""lacrosse house"" -- a bungalow since torn down. The charges were found to be false, but the episode prompted university leaders to think hard about the relationship between academics and athletics. Kevin M. White, the athletic director, now reports directly to the president of Duke. It was part of structural changes to more healthily integrate athletics into university life, said James E. Coleman Jr., a law professor who is chairman of the faculty athletics council and was chairman of the committee that investigated the athletes' behavior. (Vanderbilt made an even stronger move in 2008, disbanding the athletics department and folding it into the student life division.) Sitting in his office on Duke's Durham, N.C., campus, Dr. Coleman set his lunch tray on a mountain of papers and explained the challenges. He calls sports ""a public square for universities"" but also acknowledges how rising commercialism comes with strings that ""have become spider webs."" A 2008 report by the athletics department, ""Unrivaled Ambition: A Strategic Plan for Duke Athletics,"" praises the K-Ville bonding experience and the ""identity and cohesion"" of the rivalry with U.N.C. as it describes in stressful language the facilities arms race, skyrocketing coach salaries and the downside of television deals. ""We no longer determine at what time we will play our games, because they are scheduled by TV executives,"" it laments, going on to complain about away games at 9 p.m. ""Students are required to board a flight at 2 a.m., arriving back at their dorms at 4 or 5 a.m., and then are expected to go to class, study and otherwise act as if it were a normal school day."" And: ""our amateur student-athletes take the field with a corporate logo displayed on their uniform beside 'Duke.' "" ""The key thing is to control the things you can control and make sure the athletic program doesn't trump the rest of the university, as it has in some places,"" Dr. Coleman said. ""These presidents have to do more than pay lip service to this notion of balance between athletics and academics."" He suggests that elevating academic standards for athletes is one way to assert university -- not athletic department -- control over programs. He has also tried to foster rapport between faculty members and the athletic department. ""The difficulty is having faculty understand athletics,"" he said. ""Both sides need to cross lines. Otherwise, it becomes these two silos with no connection."" Last month, Dr. Coleman hosted a lunch that brought together Mr. White, athletics staff members and professors on his committee. He's also revamping a program to match faculty members with coaches, and sends them sports-related articles to bone up on issues.

Pointed questions about oversight of its athletic program were raised at Penn State's faculty senate meeting last month, and faculty involvement is the subject of a national meeting of the Coalition on Intercollegiate Athletics at the University of Tulsa this weekend. John S. Nichols, the group's co-chairman and professor emeritus at Penn State, says professors typically ignore the many issues that swirl around sports and influence the classroom. His list includes decisions about recruiting and admissions, and even conference realignments. Starting in 2013, the Big East will stretch over seven states, meaning not just football and basketball players but all student athletes -- and some fans -- will be making longer trips to away games. Dr. Nichols says it is time to ""put some checks in place"" on uncontrolled growth of athletics ""or consider a different model."" To be sure, efforts to rehabilitate major college sports are not new. Amid much debate, an N.C.A.A. plan to raise scholarship awards by $2,000 was being reviewed this month. Some have seen it as the athletes' due, for the money they bring in, and others as pay for play; some colleges have complained they can't afford it. Many are skeptical that reining in college sports is even possible; the dollars are simply too attractive, the pressures from outside too great. Mr. White said that it was naive ""to think we will ever put the toothpaste back in the tube."" He added, ""There is an oversized, insatiable interest in sports, and college sports is part of that."" But some decisions are in university hands. Despite Duke's ascent to basketball royalty, Cameron Indoor Stadium -- built in 1940, renovated in the 1980s and at 9,300 seats one of the smallest venues for a big-time program -- still gives thousands of the best seats to students. At many large programs, courtside seats and luxury boxes go to boosters. But ""outsiders with money,"" Dr. Coleman said, can make demands and change the way the team fits in with a university. ""We could easily double the size of our basketball stadium and sell it out,"" he said. ""That will never happen. If it does, you will know Duke has gone over to the dark side.""",Should a stadium (or court) be at the center of college culture?

Technology,Group Behind California Privacy Law Aims to Strengthen It,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/technology/group-behind-california-privacy-law-aims-to-strengthen-it.html,"Privacy advocates got a big win last year, pushing through a landmark law in California. Now, before the law even goes into effect, they are moving to make the statute tougher. Californians for Consumer Privacy, the nonprofit group behind the privacy law, announced a plan on Tuesday to give Californians new data rights and place new obligations on companies. Most significant, the proposal would require California to establish a data protection agency with the power to enforce the law and issue new regulations. The group's leader said he wants to amend the law through a ballot initiative next year. In order to do so, the group will need to first collect the valid signatures of more than 620,000 registered voters in California. ""People are waking up to the fact that they've lost control of their information and are trying to take that control back,"" said Alastair Mactaggart, the founder and board chair of Californians for Consumer Privacy.

The new privacy effort is likely to further inflame a debate over who should regulate the vast stores of personal details that tech giants have amassed on billions of people. The law passed last year, the California Consumer Privacy Act, will give consumers the right to see what personal information companies have compiled on them, delete that data and stop companies from selling it. It is scheduled to take effect next year. But many tech companies and trade associations have urged Congress to pass weaker federal privacy legislation that would overrule state laws. Trade associations have argued that it is too onerous for companies to comply with dozens of different state privacy laws and that American consumers should all have the same protections. ""Internet companies stand ready with the broader business community to support unified, national privacy legislation,"" Michael Beckerman, chief executive of the Internet Association, said last week in a statement. The group's members include Amazon, Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Uber. Mr. Mactaggart, a real estate developer, started Californians for Consumer Privacy to push for a comprehensive state privacy law. He and two colleagues -- Rick Arney, a financial industry executive, and Mary Stone Ross, a lawyer who had worked for the Central Intelligence Agency -- drafted a consumer privacy bill and introduced it as a ballot initiative. Ashkan Soltani, a privacy expert, worked on technical parts of the bill.

Many tech companies and trade groups have been working to defang the California Consumer Privacy Act ever since. The statute is believed to be the most comprehensive state consumer privacy law in the United States. Let Us Help You Protect Your Digital Life

But after a recent spate of data-mining failures at Facebook and other tech giants, Mr. Mactaggart argues that Californians need stronger rights to control the spread and use of their personal information. He plans to file a new ballot initiative on Wednesday. Among other things, it would give Californians the right to opt out of having sensitive details -- like their race, ethnicity, precise location, health and financial data -- used in advertising or marketing. It would also require companies that use algorithms to automatically make decisions about insurance and lending to explain their system's reasoning to consumers. California has long led the nation on consumer privacy. It was the first state to require companies to report data breaches, and to require companies to allow minors to delete their posts, tweets, photos and other material. In 1972, Californians voted to amend the state's Constitution to add privacy to its list of inalienable rights like freedom of speech and freedom of religion. Mr. Mactaggart said he hoped that California would also become the first state to establish an independent data privacy regulator.","The leaders of Californians for Consumer Privacy say they want to amend the law, which goes into effect next year, through a ballot initiative.",7b8e4234-2784-5757-82b7-ce47fd86f623,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/business/24CALPRIVACY1/24CALPRIVACY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f983ce941dafd33045e9ef7027e827aa51761e3be446436661424aa7ae46a003&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Facebook, like other big tech outfits, has called for a national privacy law.

Food,"Hey, Look! Nonna and Her Pasta Are on YouTube",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/14/dining/pasta-grannies-youtube-cookbook.html,"Hey, Look! Nonna and Her Pasta Are on YouTube

Vicky Bennison, a 60-year-old British woman with a background in international development, never intended Pasta Grannies to become a minor YouTube hit or to make stars of a handful of Italian nonnas who couldn't care less about their influencer status. She simply wanted to create a culinary Noah's ark to capture a way of life before it disappears. ""I keep thinking, 'Don't die before I get to you,'"" she said. Since Ms. Bennison began her project nearly five years ago, she has recorded more than 250 women (and a few men) doing what they do every day: rolling pizzoccheri from buckwheat flour to toss with Alpine cheese made only in Valtellina; twisting semolina dough into sagne ritorte to hold the horse-meat ragu popular in Puglia; marrying hand-torn strapponi with porcini mushrooms from a Tuscan forest.

More than 70 are featured in the cookbook ""Pasta Grannies: The Secrets of Italy's Best Home Cooks,"" which the British publisher Hardie Grant will release in the United States on Oct. 29. With nearly 418,000 subscribers, the Pasta Grannies YouTube channel is nothing compared with heavy hitters like Kabita's Kitchen, an Indian cooking channel that has 5.6 million subscribers. The Pasta Grannies Instagram page is relatively modest, too, with 180,000 followers. Still, for Ms. Bennison, who considers monitoring page views and mastering metrics a necessary evil, the numbers are a testament to the modern appeal of a fading kitchen art as practiced by the last generation that had no choice but to make pasta by hand.

The videos, which feature styles of pasta and sauce that often don't extend past village borders, are a soothing eddy of Old World expertise and heartfelt respect in the wild waters of digital food media. There are no Tasty-esque quick cuts, no takes of tomatoes rolling in slow motion across a farm table, or performative tosses of sauteing food. If the camera lingers as the grannies knead dough or cut bits of onion into a pot with their plastic-handled nonna knives, it's not for aesthetic reasons, but because there is something to learn from the hands of someone who has done it for 70 years. Videos are shot in home kitchens and side yards, with minimal styling and natural light. The subtitles are utilitarian, and the music as noncommittal as a hotel TV channel's. No one measures anything, but Ms. Bennison does her best to fill in the blanks with instructive narration.

Ms. Bennison is a latecomer to food media, although she always sought out local specialties during her years traveling for business to places like Siberia and Kenya. She would find herself eating stir-fried goat and drinking vodka and whey in Turkmenistan, or hunting mushrooms with members of the Russian mafia, experiences that led her to write a series of food-based travel guides, and then a cookbook. Ms. Bennison and her husband, Billy Macqueen, the children's television producer behind the Teletubbies, bought a house in Le Marche in central Italy 15 years ago and began traveling from their home in London to restore it, which is how she met her first nonna.

Some makers of a local wild-cherry wine invited her home for dinner. A grandmother named Maria made stuffed ravioli with ricotta and braised a rabbit. When the meal was over, she had to be cajoled to come out of the kitchen and say hello. Ms. Bennison was intrigued. After another local nonna gave her a pasta-making lesson, Ms. Bennison became obsessed with the outsize role that pasta plays in Italian family life, and the cultural changes that have kept the practice from being carried on by new generations. Initially, she thought she would simply write about the women, but making pasta is a skilled, very physical process. ""It was very obvious that you needed a video of it if you were going to save it,"" she said. Ms. Bennison's crew is small. She and a videographer, Andrea Savorani Neri, shoot the images. Mr. Neri's neighbor in Faenza, Livia De Giovanni, is her granny finder, and the ambassador to the women and their families. ""She is essential for closing the deal,"" Ms. Bennison said.

She first made about one video a month, posting them on YouTube as a way to organize the work and show publishers that the idea was worth investing in. ""It was more of a hobby, really,"" she said. Three years into it, she had about 5,000 subscribers. ""I remember thinking how well I was doing."" Then it all changed. Her videos started to show up on Facebook and food sites. In August 2018, Business Insider posted an article highlighting some of the rarer pastas, like stretchy Sardinian filindeu and intricate lorighittas, prepared by Cesaria, a 95-year-old woman from the Sardinian village of Morgongiori who showed how to twist strands of pasta into something that looks like a hoop earring.

The traffic came so fast that Ms. Bennison thought at first that her site had been hacked. Cesaria was getting millions of page views. ""Everything went ballistic,"" Ms. Bennison said. The videos caught the eye of YouTube executives, who greenlighted a short documentary on Pasta Grannies for a series on the platform's Spotlight channel, which highlights feel-good tales about people who use YouTube to further their passions. Hunter Johnson, 35, is a producer with Xpedition Media who pitched Pasta Grannies for the series. He recently returned from three days on Ischia, in the Gulf of Naples, shooting Ms. Bennison and some grannies with a team of 17 people. ""I've produced hundreds of hours of TV, and we can smell a con a mile away,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""She didn't go about this thinking this has entertainment value. There's no, like, polish to this. She takes it truly from a scientific approach."" Although Ms. Bennison appreciates the attention, she said she increasingly finds herself ""a slave to the YouTube algorithms."" But she needs the platform: YouTube ads pay about a third of the $800 or so it costs to make each video, which includes a cash appearance fee for each granny. So far, she isn't paying herself. ""With my book advance and my pension, I kind of just about break even,"" she said. ""As a business model, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.""

She'd prefer to tell stories, like that of Rosa Turri, a pasta granny who lives in Faenza, a small city in Emilia-Romagna. Ms. Turri's specialty is straw-and-hay tagliatelle with peas, in which half the dough is colored with spinach. Her son comes to pick up her pasta for lunch almost every day. The ability to make pasta was once so important that, as a test of her skill, she had to make some for her father-in-law the day after her wedding.

Media,"What's Next at Fox News, With Ailes Out and Murdoch In?",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/01/business/media/whats-next-at-fox-news-with-ailes-out-and-murdoch-in.html,"One important thing has been lost in all of the obituaries of Roger Ailes's career at Fox News. The Roger Ailes we know, the one who built a conservative-leaning network from scratch and enforced its philosophy without compromise, would not exist if not for his corporate patron, Rupert Murdoch. Without Mr. Murdoch's nearly unconditional support, Mr. Ailes would never have been able to make Fox News the political-media earthmover it became. It was right at home in Mr. Murdoch's global media business, whose news properties already had a record of nudging -- more like shoving -- politics to the right on at least three continents, often with the same raucous populism that's so identified with Fox. Mr. Murdoch's new role as the interim chief of Fox News, pending the naming of a successor to Mr. Ailes, is a genius move. If there's anyone whose understanding of the network's core audience of older white traditionalists is close to that of Mr. Ailes, it is Mr. Murdoch.

But Mr. Murdoch, 85, is serving as a bridge to something else at Fox News. What that will be rests in part with his two sons, Lachlan, 44, and James, 43. Mr. Murdoch elevated them to top jobs at 21st Century Fox and its sibling News Corp. 18 months ago. They are already putting their own stamp on the (publicly traded) family business, mostly in its non-news -- noncontroversial -- entertainment divisions of television and film. Now, with Fox News, they are finally wading into their father's gladiator pit, where politics is the blood sport. And, to the extent that he defers to their judgment, it could offer the first glimpse of where they would take a media empire that, under Rupert Murdoch, asserted itself into the political ethos of the United States, the United Kingdom and his homeland of Australia in ways not seen since the days of William Randolph Hearst. For now, though, the billion-dollar-plus (a year, in profit) question is whether their involvement in the succession plans at Fox News fundamentally changes a network that has functioned at times as a more influential, conservative presence in American politics than the Republican Party itself. The Murdochs are still in crisis mode at Fox News. The network was rocked yet again on Friday, this time by a devastating article in New York magazine by Gabriel Sherman, who reported that Fox News paid a $3 million settlement to a booker who said Mr. Ailes carried on an abusive 20-year relationship with her -- at times using company resources and personnel to facilitate it. Mr. Ailes denied the charges through his lawyer. It immediately raised new questions about whether the Murdochs would be forced into a bigger house cleaning of Mr. Ailes's remaining team of lieutenants at Fox News, where, it seems, sexual harassment payouts were not followed by the recognition that there just might be a problem, let alone by any obvious attempts to aggressively address the corporate culture that facilitated the behavior in the first place.

Fox News's reporting often tells a much different story. Its hosts don't hesitate to report that ""the science is still in question,"" as Heather Childers recently did, or that warnings about climate change are emanating from ""people aligned with the political left in the scientific community,"" as the host Steve Doocy said in April while promoting a film purporting to debunk climate change. Even before Mr. Ailes's ouster, climate activists were hopeful that James Murdoch would force changes to skeptical coverage of climate change at Fox News, as well as its corporate cousin The Wall Street Journal, whose editorial page has great sway with congressional Republicans. To nudge it along, one group, Partnership for Responsible Growth, has run ads with both outlets reminding Republicans that their leaders used to support market-based solutions to climate change -- and calling on The Journal's editorial page to acknowledge humankind's role. David Fenton, a longtime strategist for progressive causes whose agency, Fenton, made the ads, said its main goal was to push a bipartisan solution in the form of a carbon pricing system. The Murdoch outlets have been standing in the way, he said, by creating a ""false reality bubble denying science"" that scares amenable Republican politicians away from the cause. ""James knows better, and there's no way that someone like that could be happy with the terribly negative role the Murdoch properties have played in slowing bipartisan action on climate,"" Mr. Fenton said. None of the Murdochs would comment for this column. But it's impossible to talk about the intersection of their political and business interests without lingering for a moment on the latter. Even if some of Fox News's programming drives one or both of the brothers bananas, it is still a major cash generator for 21st Century Fox, with $1.6 billion in operating profit in fiscal 2015, according to Brian Wieser, an analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Fox News's raison d'etre was to fill a void that conservative-leaning viewers sensed in the mainstream media. That guiding philosophy has provided a steady compass, and a lucrative revenue stream, as its competitors have struggled with their own paths.

That could provide a strong argument against drastic change, especially for the elder Mr. Murdoch, who is by all accounts enjoying his new role running the network and is saying he won't rush into picking a successor to Mr. Ailes. It seems a near certainty that he will stay through the election. With Mr. Murdoch at the helm, the network covered Hillary Clinton's convention in Philadelphia with all the skepticism you'd expect. It didn't show the speech of Khizr Khan, the Muslim father of a fallen American soldier. Then, there was Bill O'Reilly's aside that the slaves who built the White House, whom Michelle Obama referred to in her prime-time address, were ""well fed"" and adequately housed. That said, Fox News's audience tends to be older, which is why executives there indicate that the family views its younger prime-time star, Megyn Kelly, as an important part of its future. Her appeal extends to the core Fox News viewer as well as to those with more mainstream news tastes. Ms. Kelly's contract, like Mr. O'Reilly's, comes up for renewal next year. Before Mr. Ailes left, Ms. Kelly seemed certain to leave. Now it's a given that her decision will depend on how the Murdochs decide to proceed -- as will so, so much else.","Rupert Murdoch as the network's interim chief after Roger Ailes's ouster is a smart move, but Mr. Murdoch's sons may have a hand in the direction of the empire.",8c746c48-8958-564b-8de1-4c6d9945dd49,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/01/business/01rutenberg/01rutenberg-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7617a5175a095cc4a77734190e76709cdf1a10509e1a2a4e0667914049c69c77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"As interim chief of Fox News, Rupert Murdoch, center, is serving as a bridge to something else at the political-media powerhouse.",8c746c48-8958-564b-8de1-4c6d9945dd49,N24News/imgs/8c746c48-8958-564b-8de1-4c6d9945dd49.jpg,16
Science,"Dr. John Sarno, 93, Dies; Best-Selling Author Tied Pain to Anxieties",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/science/john-sarno-dead-healing-back-pain-doctor.html,"Dr. John Sarno in ""All the Rage,"" a documentary film about him that was released Friday.

John E. Sarno, a doctor at New York University whose controversial books on the psychological origins of chronic pain sold over a million copies, even while he was largely ignored or maligned by many of his medical peers, died Thursday in Danbury, Conn. He was 93. His death, at a hospital, was confirmed by his daughter Christina Horner, who said the cause was cardiac failure. He had a home in nearby Carmel, N.Y., as well as one in Manhattan. He died a day before his 94th birthday and the release of ""All the Rage (Saved by Sarno),"" a documentary film about him. Revered by some as a saint and dismissed by others as a quack, Dr. Sarno maintained that most nontraumatic instances of chronic pain -- including back pain, gastrointestinal disorders, headaches and fibromyalgia -- are physical manifestations of deep-seated psychological anxieties.

His books, including the best-selling ""Healing Back Pain: The Mind-Body Connection,"" became popular largely through word of mouth. Thousands of people have claimed to have been cured by reading them. His ideas inspired online support forums that doubled almost as shrines to him, and he received glowing endorsements from celebrities like Anne Bancroft, Larry David and Howard Stern, who dedicated his autobiography to the doctor. Another who swore by him, the financial writer and Wall Street trader Edward Siedle, described Dr. Sarno in a Forbes column as ""the most brilliant doctor in America and unfortunately, a largely neglected national treasure."" The mainstream medical community, however, generally dismissed his theories as simplistic and unscientific, and felt that he went too far in saying that emotional factors not only worsen chronic pain, but also directly cause it. ""His views are definitely considered on the fringe,"" said Dr. Christopher Gharibo, a pain management specialist at the Langone Medical Center at N.Y.U. ""His position was that almost all chronic pain is purely psychological and 'all in the head,' which I certainly disagree with.""

Eric Sherman, a psychotherapist who worked with Dr. Sarno for many years, recalled how Dr. Sarno's colleagues would belittle him behind his back in lunchtime conversations at N.Y.U., even as some would visit him privately for their ailments. ""It was him against the world, yet he was never afraid of not fitting in,"" Dr. Sherman said. ""He had a 'damn the torpedoes' perspective on his work, and was notoriously indifferent to others' opinions of him."" Dr. Sarno, who specialized in rehabilitation medicine, developed his theories over almost 50 years at N.Y.U. He gave the various forms of chronic pain the collective name ""tension myositis syndrome"" (T.M.S.), which, apart from its psychological roots, he attributed to mild oxygen deprivation caused by reduced blood flow to muscles and nerves throughout the body. He said most of his patients improved simply by learning and thinking about the psychosomatic connection to pain, and that others recovered by journaling regularly and, in some cases, doing psychotherapy. Dr. Sarno, a health-conscious man who walked from his Upper East Side home to N.Y.U. every day well into his 80s, said he had gotten rid of his allergies by regarding them as T.M.S.

Some of his ideas, like his assertion that there is no correlation between chronic back pain and herniated discs, have been validated by research published in The New England Journal of Medicine. A handful of doctors have embraced his mind-body theories and started testing them empirically. ""In my practice, I've seen enough examples of people getting rid of chronic pain through psychotherapy to know that the mind-body connection needs to be researched in more depth,"" said Dr. Howard Schubiner, who started a Mind-Body Medicine program several years ago at Providence Hospital in Southfield, Mich., basing it on the work of Dr. Sarno. A study led by David Schechter, a professor at the University of Southern California, in 2007 found that chronic pain subjects who underwent a mind-body treatment -- which included reading educational materials, journaling about emotions and, in more extreme cases, undergoing psychotherapy -- experienced an average pain reduction of 52 percent.

John Ernest Sarno Jr. was born June 23, 1923, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to John Ernest Sarno, a printing press worker, and the former Delia Astone, a homemaker. He grew up in the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn and at 16 graduated from Newtown High School in Elmhurst, Queens. He repeated his senior year to attend, and graduate from, the private Horace Mann School in the Bronx. He went on to Kalamazoo College in Michigan and stayed for three years before leaving in 1943 to join the Army. He worked in field hospitals in Europe for the remainder of World War II. Dr. Sarno received his medical degree from Columbia University in 1950 and spent nearly a decade in family practice in Fishkill, N.Y., where he founded the Mid-Hudson Medical Group. He returned to New York in 1960 for a residency in pediatric medicine at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center and then another residency at the Institute of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at N.Y.U.",Dr. Sarno was both hailed and dismissed for his contention that most chronic pain could be traced to deep within the psyche.,0dda5608-181e-5005-b62d-5eaab5456d6d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/25/obituaries/25SARNO-obit-02/23SARNO-obit-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=412&w=786&s=1c2419e92f7c68c9f6be8bb06455cd3705d47c7e7f1839b3b7a9d3812e01ec21&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Sarno's book ""Healing Back Pain"" became popular largely through word of mouth.

Travel,Montreal's Green Alleyways Take Visitors Backstage,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/30/travel/montreal-green-alleyways-take-visitors-backstage.html,"The back alleys of most cities are ugly, collecting puddles and trash. In Montreal, by contrast, they've been growing into surprisingly lovely neighborhood hubs, and more than 250 blocks of them have recently banded together as official Ruelles Vertes, or green alleyways. They feature gardens that give residents leafy space for trick-or-treating, block parties, pop-up restaurants and more. Now the alleys are not only providing gathering places, but also giving visitors back-door peeks into Montreal's daily life.

In one of North America's most bike-friendly cities, tour companies like Fitz & Follwell (Fitzandfollwell.co) and Spade & Palacio (spadeandpalacio.com) are now including Montreal's green alleyways in their tours. Fitz & Follwell, which calls the routes ""laneways"" for greater appeal, has created an alley-specific bike tour. For the independent, the local environmental nonprofit Regroupement des Eco-Quartiers has developed a smartphone app, Parcours Verts et Actifs, which translates to Green Paths and Assets (eco-quartiers.org/parcoursvertsetactifs), to point urban explorers down verdant back routes. While only in French, the app transcends language with photos and maps, giving users license to duck down alleyways as if on a scavenger hunt.

""In a big city it can be difficult for people to find community, but the laneways bring people together,"" Shea Mayer, founder of Fitz & Follwell, said. It's not uncommon for visitors on his company's tours to be invited to join in a neighborhood potluck or onto a back balcony for wine.

While a few neighborhoods in the United States, like San Francisco's Chinatown, have begun to touch up their alleys, Montreal's wide-ranging embrace of the spaces stands out. The city incorporates its back routes into events, from Restaurant Weeks that include alleyway pop-ups to ""white alleys"" with winter sledding and ice rinks. Montreal's several thousand alleyways started as country routes along old agricultural tracts. By the early 20th century they'd developed into social centers where children played and merchants delivered ice and coal. Informal alley use continued through the decades. Danny Pavlopoulos, 29, a Spade & Palacio co-founder, recalled playing hockey behind his neighborhood's row houses growing up. Now he's among the Montrealers formalizing their communal spaces by seeking a Ruelle Verte designation, his in the immigrant-heavy Parc-Extension area.

On a recent alleyway tour, Martin Coutu, a guide with Fitz & Follwell, wheeled his bike down the Ruelle Demers in the Plateau Mont-Royal neighborhood, taking visitors past a yellow windmill, bubbling fountain and lush ferns planted down the alley's middle. A bearded Quebecer man glared at first. After Mr. Coutu greeted him in French, the man introduced himself as Fred Gougeon, a fourth-generation Ruelle Demers resident. Within minutes Mr. Gougeon was pulling out a calendar of his family's decades along the alleyway. It featured photos including an uncle alongside a vintage car and one of his mother in her wedding dress there. Then Mr. Gougeon unlocked the gate to show his private garden, overflowing with flowers and his welder grandfather's metal sculptures.

Alleyways make people open up, Mr. Coutu explained. ""I find Montrealers very engaging when we meet them in the alleyways,"" he said. ""It's like sharing their backyards -- still a private feeling but public as well, like a shared secret."" Before 2010, Eco-Quartiers had assisted with the establishment of 62 Ruelles Vertes. Between 2010 and 2016, that number grew by 188, to 250 Ruelles Vertes today, said Nicolas Montpetit, the director of Regroupement des Eco-Quartiers, which gives guidance and installation support. ""In the past six years the number of green alleyways has just exploded,"" he said. ""There's a little competition with the boroughs on which can have the most."" Many blocks have added planters, benches, murals and imaginative touches. The Belanger-Des Ecores alley in the family-friendly Rosemont neighborhood, for instance, features a wooden display of characters from ""The Adventures of Tintin"" comics. Other alleyways work with what they've got. In the bohemian Mile End (home to the band Arcade Fire), one block has maintained a dozen grapevines, some more than a half-century old. They lend shade and grapes to share, Mr. Coutu said. Some Montreal alleyways share wine, hosting regular happy hours where visitors are welcomed. One Thursday evening in the Villeray neighborhood, Normand Ranger poured family and friends Cote du Rhone at one of his alley's 34 annual events, which include block sales and movie showings. Mr. Ranger showed off communal herb planters and painted outlines of games like Four Corners as area children played. ""The first step was to green the alleyway. Now the project is to have a better life with the neighbors,"" he said. ""Each year we try new things.""","In Montreal, back alleys have been growing into surprisingly lovely neighborhood hubs, and hundreds have recently banded together as green alleyways.",e8c984be-8e91-523c-b0af-ddbf66735e5d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/30/travel/30HeadsUpMontreal1/30HeadsUpMontreal1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ba951bb473f187fb486e7a9d2618e38660e9ad2995688ec94c480ce8310f9cf8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An old tub and straw figure in a back alley.,e8c984be-8e91-523c-b0af-ddbf66735e5d,N24News/imgs/e8c984be-8e91-523c-b0af-ddbf66735e5d.jpg,4

Art & Design,American Museum of Natural History Announces September Reopening,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/arts/design/american-museum-of-natural-history-reopen-covid.html,"As when the Metropolitan Museum of Art began charging a mandatory fee for visitors who do not live in New York State in 2018, the city had to sign off on the change because it owns the museum's building.

Residents of New York State, New Jersey and Connecticut will still be able to choose the amount they pay, but will need to show address identification.

All theaters, including the Hayden Planetarium, and halls that feature a large number of touchable interactives will remain closed, according to a news release. Food service will also not be available.

The museum had been closed since March 13. New York City museums were slated to get permission to reopen on July 20 under Phase 4 of the city's reopening plan, but Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo withheld permission indefinitely earlier this month, citing the possibility of a second wave of cases.

The museum is the first in the city to publicly set a new targeted reopening date since Mr. Cuomo's announcement. The Metropolitan Museum of Art had announced in mid-July that it would reopen Aug. 29, and the New-York Historical Society said earlier this month it planned an outdoor exhibition to open on Aug. 14, with indoor shows opening Sept. 11. But it remains to be seen whether the virus situation in the city will be stable enough to allow cultural institutions to reopen by then.","The museum said it is planning to reopen on Sept. 9, pending permission from state and city officials.",20f248b6-9e47-57a5-93cc-0cd963bce41f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/31/arts/30amnh-item/30amnh-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cdca3b878a82b73e288c73ff84f8527371a014acd408990de3edb7cacb6dc4f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The American Museum of Natural History has announced plans to reopen with limited capacity and Covid-19 protocols in place.,20f248b6-9e47-57a5-93cc-0cd963bce41f,N24News/imgs/20f248b6-9e47-57a5-93cc-0cd963bce41f.jpg,14
Fashion & Style,It Was Love at First Follow,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/weddings/it-was-love-at-first-follow.html,"Dr. Sharath Puttichanda was an emergency-medicine psychiatrist at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence in December 2019 when he stumbled across Sundeep Dosanjh's Instagram posts from Machu Picchu. A neighbor was off on an adventure in Peru while he was stuck home in wintry New England, Dr. Puttichanda (left) said, so he began wandering on the internet. ""I was jealous,"" he said. Mr. Dosanjh's Instagram posts were loaded with hashtags that included #gayindian. There he found more than just vicarious travel adventures. ""He had this beautiful post about his coming-out story,"" said Dr. Puttichanda, 38 and the assistant director for psychiatric emergency services at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. ""I read that and I remember telling two of my best friends, 'There's this guy, and he had this beautiful story, and there's something so familiar about him that I feel the need to reach out.'""

He didn't. Instead, he began following Mr. Dosanjh, 36, on Instagram. So a few weeks later, when Mr. Dosanjh posted a story about a Lyft driver's off-handed, offensive remark about his ethnicity, Dr. Puttichanda posted a fiery comment noting that he also had had similar experiences. ""I responded, then looked at his pictures,"" said Mr. Dosanjh, a web and communications specialist for the school district in Elk Grove, Calif. ""He's cute, and I followed him back, and we started bantering."" Dr. Puttichanda had a break coming up, and Mr. Dosanjh suggested that he take a red-eye to San Francisco, so that the two might meet. But Dr. Puttichanda had tickets to a Broadway show, so, instead, he all but brought Mr. Dosanjh along on his trip to New York, via FaceTime. He narrated every event, and the two were still on FaceTime together until both fell asleep.

""I said, 'I don't know what's going on between you and I, but I have to let you know that I can't leave Northern California,'"" he said. ""He was like, 'OK. I have nothing holding me back.' And my heart literally melted."" The first actual meeting between the two was still more than a month in their future. With 3,000 miles separating them, they had to be creative about ""dates."" For their first, each went to a local P.F. Chang's, and fired up FaceTime to experience dinner almost as if they were in the same place. ""We had first-date conversation, looked at the menu together, everything you would do on a real in-person date,"" Mr. Dosanjh said. ""We had to think out every single detail to make it work."" They had a second virtual date at the Cheesecake Factory shortly afterward. Mr. Dosanjh sent flowers to Dr. Puttichanda for Valentine's Day. At the end of February, Dr. Puttichanda flew to San Francisco for an 11-day holiday, and Mr. Dosanjh surprised him at the baggage carousel. ""We kissed,"" Dr. Puttichanda said, ""and in that moment, I let everything go."" The two were married Sept. 25, in a wedding that began with a Sikh Punjabi ceremony at the Sheldon Inn, a restaurant in Elk Grove, Calif. Jasminder Singh, a cousin of Mr. Dosanjh who became a Universal Life minister for the event, oversaw the signing of the civil marriage license.","Instagram brought them together but a continent separated them, so Dr. Sharath Puttichanda and Sundeep Dosanjh fell in love well before they met in person.",d15d30f2-fcbe-527a-b54a-b5d8760c7b56,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/fashion/weddings/04dosanjh-puttichanda1/oakImage-1601399331195-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=047277481247835cfb30102519a6b47d2cc25d0dad93f7ce94cfa03717c55d45&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sharath Puttichanda, left, and Sundeep Dosanjh.",d15d30f2-fcbe-527a-b54a-b5d8760c7b56,N24News/imgs/d15d30f2-fcbe-527a-b54a-b5d8760c7b56.jpg,19
Travel,"April Bloomfield on London, California and Not Overplanning Trips",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/travel/april-bloomfield-los-angeles-restaurant-hearth-hound.html,"The English-born chef April Bloomfield has planted her particular brand of hearty, generally carnivorous cuisine in New York (The Spotted Pig, The Breslin Bar & Dining Room, The John Dory Oyster Bar, White Gold Butchers, Salvation Taco) and San Francisco (Tosca Cafe). She's now extended her mini-empire to Los Angeles with the very English-sounding Hearth & Hound in Hollywood, which is scheduled to open in early December, and heartiness is deeply embedded in it. ""It's a concept all designed around wood fire,"" she said. ""We have a great 13-foot hearth and a wood oven."" Expect food that is ""clean, vibrant, earthy, smoky -- all of those things you think about when you think about wood-fired food. It's definitely going to be -- I wouldn't say healthy, but clean flavors.""

Ms. Bloomfield, 43, was a relative latecomer to overseas travel -- she didn't leave England until she was 19 -- but has made up for it in the years since. I spoke with her about her approach to travel, her love for California and how sometimes the best approach to a new place is simply to wander. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation.

With restaurants on both coasts, you are now traveling quite a bit. What's your general approach?

Efficiency. I like to keep things moving a lot. I don't want to be that person everyone points at when they don't take stuff out of their pockets. I basically do the same thing every time. Everything has its place -- my passport, my phone.

I like to plan a few things in advance but I try not to overplan: Meals at a few important restaurants and play the rest by ear -- just go with the flow. That way you really get to experience the city and you're not under time constraints.","Travel tips from the chef, who extends her mini-empire with her new Los Angeles restaurant, Hearth & Hound.",c47cd61d-5fe7-56c1-83f6-0519ddf1d86f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/03/travel/03qna/03qna-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=2beb38f19181cb7b1459cf948dda4e2d85f570e820659bbf464963adad7f5aa2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,April Bloomfield will open her first restaurant in Los Angeles in December.,c47cd61d-5fe7-56c1-83f6-0519ddf1d86f,N24News/imgs/c47cd61d-5fe7-56c1-83f6-0519ddf1d86f.jpg,4
Your Money,Retirees Turn to Virtual Villages for Mutual Support,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/29/your-money/retirees-turn-to-virtual-villages-for-mutual-support.html,"RICK CLOUD, 68, knew that he wanted to stay in his home in Austin, Tex., as he aged. But Mr. Cloud, who is divorced, was not sure how he could do that without relying on his two daughters. Then he ran across the idea of virtual retirement villages, whose members pay a yearly fee to gain access to resources and social connections that help them age in place. Sold on the concept, Mr. Cloud joined with some friends to start Capital City Village four years ago. ""Our virtual village can connect me with people my own age so I can do more things,"" said Mr. Cloud, a retired technology consultant. ""I worry about being single and getting older."" Now, Mr. Cloud has all the support he needs. He can tap into Capital City Village's network of more than 100 service companies referred by members. Dozens of volunteers will walk his dog or do yard work. When he wants to meet people, Mr. Cloud can attend house concerts in a member's home, go to happy hour at the local Mexican restaurant or hear a champion storyteller give a talk. He has also made over 40 village friends.

An offshoot of the sharing economy, virtual villages are popping up all over the country. Currently, there are 140 villages in 40 states, according to Village to Village Network, which helps establish and manage the villages. Another 120 virtual villages are on the drawing boards, as baby boomers like Mr. Cloud begin gravitating to them. These villages are low-cost ways to age in place and delay going to costly assisted-living facilities, say experts. Yearly membership dues average about $450 nationally, and most villages offer subsidies for people who cannot afford membership costs. Armies of volunteers, who help run many villages, also help lower member costs by doing yard work, picking up prescriptions or taking members shopping or to the airport. At the core of these villages is conciergelike service referrals for members, said Judy Willett, national director of the Village to Village Network. Members can find household repair services, and sometimes even personal trainers, chefs or practitioners of Reiki, the Japanese healing technique. Most important, the villages foster social connections through activities like potlucks, happy hours and group trips. This socializing gives people a greater sense of purpose and increases well-being, said Dr. Marc Agronin, a geriatric psychiatrist in Miami and author of ""How We Age."" ""As people get older, they face the major dilemma of isolation,"" Dr. Agronin said. ""Having a local network of people to engage with opens up whole new worlds. It's about discovering your strengths and the joy of living.""

Virtual village members stay in touch through village websites and email, or by calling local village offices. Many villages also turn to social media sites like Facebook, Twitter and YouTube to stay in touch, Ms. Willett added. A desire to age in place surrounded by friends was the impetus behind the nation's first virtual village, Beacon Hill Village, started in Boston in 2002. It now has nearly 400 members and has served as a blueprint for other villages nationally, including Capital City Village. For Susan McWhinney-Morse, who helped to found the village, staying on Beacon Hill was a no-brainer. She loved the community, her neighbors and her elegant rowhouse there. ""So we looked at community resources, such as transportation and health care, and asked ourselves, 'How can we access them in an orderly way?' "" she said. The answer was that virtual retirement villages could address crucial aging issues. People who passionately believe in controlling their lives are best suited to the villages, said Ms. McWhinney-Morse, now 81. ""This is not a social service model,"" she said. ""This is how we take care of ourselves. You need time and energy to devote to it.""

The village, she added, ""gives you a sense of worth and accomplishment."" Preliminary studies show that virtual villages are indeed working. They increase confidence that a person will be able to stay at home and reduce possible falls, said Andrew Scharlach, Kleiner professor of aging at the University of California, Berkeley.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' ""The whole idea is being engaged and helping one another,"" said Mr. Scharlach, who has studied nine retirement villages in California. ""They're not just services, they're designed to be communities."" He added that 90 percent of adults wanted to stay in their own homes as they aged, anyway. ""So there's a lot of promise in virtual villages,"" he said.

In the future, baby boomers will push virtual villages into mass acceptance, Mr. Scharlach said. ""They don't want to be dependent on families or the government,"" he said. ""And the idea of consumers calling their own shots is taking off."" One lure is that virtual villages can be tweaked to fit any environment -- including the country. Monadnock at Home, which serves eight towns in New Hampshire, has 130 members. It has a database of over 100 vendor contacts for help with stacking wood, shoveling snow or transporting members. The village has only about a dozen social events a year, such as maple sugaring parties, though. ""We're a bunch of loners up here,"" said Frank Harnden, chairman of Monadnock at Home. ""So we're more focused on services, since it's harder to get together. The municipalities don't have services in place."" Mr. Harnden, 69 and married, was hooked on virtual villages after hearing about them. Like Mr. Cloud in Texas, he was worried about aging. His parents had gone through difficult final years with serious illnesses. A former boy scout, Mr. Harnden also likes lending people a helping hand, and has driven two hours to help a member by doing a 10-minute task. ""I like doing a good turn daily,"" he said. For all their good works, virtual villages usually are not equipped to handle serious illnesses. A few villages, however, are experimenting with health care-related innovations. Newton at Home, in West Newton, Mass., lets members participate in a collaborative program with a local hospital to prevent readmissions. Volunteers check in daily with sick members, take trash to the street or do grocery shopping. ""Not being readmitted to the hospital saves money,"" said Maureen Grannan, executive director of Newton at Home. Volunteers, who do 97 percent of the services, also help stretch member dollars, she added.","An offshoot of the sharing economy, virtual villages are popping up all over the country to offer older adults access to resources and social connections that help them age in place.",3b412e91-e186-5eec-88ab-8efad6b4f8d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/29/your-money/29retiring-pic1/29retiring-pic1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=7fb57eef6896123765d115ea5a1b69483172ae6799c9a7d0b48ca2103916b5b1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Some members of the Capital City Village watching a movie in Austin, Tex.: from left, Phyllis Waddle, Rachel Flake and Rick Cloud.",3b412e91-e186-5eec-88ab-8efad6b4f8d2,N24News/imgs/3b412e91-e186-5eec-88ab-8efad6b4f8d2.jpg,21
Media,"Sony Pictures, Shifting Toward TV, Names Tony Vinciquerra Its C.E.O.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/11/business/media/sony-pictures-entertainment-tony-vinciquerra.html,"Sony Pictures Entertainment, bedeviled in recent years by movie misfires, a devastating cyberattack and executive ejections, on Thursday named Tony Vinciquerra its chairman and chief executive. Mr. Vinciquerra, 62, who has a long TV track record but little moviemaking expertise, succeeds Michael Lynton, who is stepping down to focus on his board role at Snap, the parent company of Snapchat. Kazuo Hirai, the president and chief executive of Sony Corporation, based in Tokyo, made the decision to hire Mr. Vinciquerra after pondering people like Peter Rice, the chairman of Fox Networks Group, and Andy Bird, chairman of Walt Disney International. While the Japanese have at times been seen as absentee landlords at Sony Pictures, Mr. Hirai has in recent months worked from the Sony lot, home to the Spider-Man movies, sitcoms like ""Kevin Can Wait"" and game-show chestnuts like ""Jeopardy."" Mr. Hirai and Mr. Vinciquerra declined interview requests. In a statement, Mr. Hirai said, ""Tony is a proven, results-oriented leader,"" and noted that he has ""expertise in managing digital disruption."" Mr. Hirai also praised Mr. Lynton. Tony Vinciquerra is known as a hands-on operator with extensive deal-making experience. Aside from giving agents and producers a new ring to kiss, the arrival of Mr. Vinciquerra, an understated, disciplined executive with blue-collar roots in Albany, sends several messages about Sony's future.

For starters, it is about television. The studio's film division has struggled badly, recently prompting a $1 billion write-down, but television production -- all but abandoned by Sony 16 years ago -- has emerged as an engine. With hits like ""The Crown,"" ""Better Call Saul"" and ""The Goldbergs"" in its stable, Sony Pictures Television contributed more than 90 percent of the entertainment company's overall income last year. Sony also operates a vast array of fast-growing overseas cable networks. Mr. Vinciquerra, who formerly ran the Fox Networks Group and Hearst-Argyle Television, will be charged with expanding Sony's small-screen business and steering it through a time of tectonic change. Many consumers are eschewing traditional distribution in favor of streaming services and viewing on mobile devices.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Sony is the only major television studio without direct access to a broadcast network or big cable channel in the United States. That is an increasing hindrance, as the likes of ABC, CBS, the CW, Fox and NBC buy more of their programming from in-house studios. To improve its access to distribution, Sony could make an acquisition or strategic alliance -- Lionsgate, which owns Starz, has been seen as one target -- or become more tightly linked with PlayStation Vue, which is operated at arms-length from Sony's entertainment businesses. Mr. Vinciquerra has extensive deal-making experience. In recent years, he has served as a senior adviser to TPG Capital, which has invested in Hollywood firms like Creative Artists Agency and STX Entertainment. He serves on the boards of Univision and Pandora Internet Radio.

For Sony's movie division, which has struggled because of a lack of global blockbusters, Mr. Vinciquerra represents good news -- at least for Thomas E. Rothman, who took over as film chairman two years ago. Mr. Rothman has a temperament that can rub some people the wrong way. But Mr. Vinciquerra respects and understands Mr. Rothman: The two men worked together at Fox. Even so, Sony's motion picture group (Columbia Pictures, TriStar, Screen Gems, Affirm Films) has a make-or-break stretch ahead at the box office. Mr. Rothman's coming lineup includes bets like ""Spider-Man: Homecoming,"" ""Blade Runner 2049"" and ""Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle."" Sony is also vying to renew its contract with Eon Productions and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to distribute the James Bond films. Mr. Vinciquerra, a protege of Peter Chernin, the longtime media kingpin, is known as a hands-on operator, which would be a shift from Mr. Lynton, who was sometimes seen as giving lieutenants a wide berth. (Mr. Lynton, who was involved in the hiring of Mr. Vinciquerra, also had broader duties, including overseeing Sony Music. Rob Stringer, the chief executive of Sony Music, will eventually report directly to Mr. Hirai.) Amid Hollywood's runaway egos, Mr. Vinciquerra has an understated, somewhat rumpled style that makes him stand out. He grew up in a two-bedroom apartment in Albany, sleeping on a foldout sofa and sweeping up hair in his grandfather's barber shop, according to a 2009 profile in The Los Angeles Times. He graduated from the State University of New York at Albany. Early in his media career, Mr. Vinciquerra sold advertising for radio and television stations. In 1997, he joined Hearst-Argyle to help build a TV station group; when he arrived, the company owned five stations, and when he left for Fox in 2001, it had about 30.","Mr. Vinciquerra, with a long TV track record but little experience in movies, will be guiding Sony's entertainment business through a time of tectonic change.",19c16445-e3ea-5ae7-9ad0-c67f5e5c41b4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/12/business/12SONY3/12SONY3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5c6550e432ef0275b3f1545da691d78cb8d4b50e2f4ca543f2a20103aba4c8fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sony's motion picture group has a make-or-break stretch ahead at the box office.,19c16445-e3ea-5ae7-9ad0-c67f5e5c41b4,N24News/imgs/19c16445-e3ea-5ae7-9ad0-c67f5e5c41b4.jpg,16
Health,"Laced With Two Insecticides, New Nets Protect Children From Malaria",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/health/malaria-nets-children-africa.html,"Mosquito nets infused with two pesticides work much better against malaria than those with only one, reducing prevalence in children by 44 percent, according to a recent study.

As a result of the report, published in The Lancet last month, the World Health Organization has recommended that the two-chemical nets be used in areas where mosquitoes have developed resistance to the first-line insecticide.

The new nets contain pyrethroids, a class of chemicals used in nets for over a decade, along with the newer compound, piperonyl butoxide, which blocks mosquitoes' ability to break down pyrethroids. (It is sometimes called a ""pesticide synergist."")

The Vestergaard company, which introduced pyrethroid-infused nets in 2004, later developed a two-chemical version that the W.H.O. began evaluating in 2014. Now many companies have similar nets awaiting W.H.O. approval.","The W.H.O. endorses adding a ""synergist"" chemical to bed nets infused with older pesticides because the combination more effectively kills and repels mosquitoes.",99fd47b0-37a0-503a-9d85-fcca19c446b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/science/08SCI-GLOBAL/08SCI-GLOBAL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=31bf62146a47ad708582e59a260eea40fbb4027f5828fedca8333d871e67f05d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A mosquito net was hung in a home in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, last month.

Real Estate,First Manhattan Condo by a Chinese Developer,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/realestate/first-manhattan-condo-by-a-chinese-developer.html,"A 38-story tower rising on a busy block in Midtown is being billed as the first condominium project in Manhattan developed entirely by a company from China. Euro Properties, based in Hong Kong, recently unveiled 118 East 59th Street, a 29-unit high-rise between Park and Lexington Avenues. In recent years, Chinese companies have flocked to build in New York, but typically partnered with local firms, and in those rare cases where they have flown solo, it has been in the outside boroughs. While 118 East 59th Street may be a pioneer, brokers say its developers still have to convince buyers that its location, wedged between office towers, can fetch the same gold-plated prices as nearby Billionaires' Row. ""It's a location that's in transition,"" said Tamir Shemesh, an associate broker with the Corcoran Group who is marketing a new 22-unit condo at 337 East 62nd Street. ""But the towers that are coming up could change a very commercial area.""

Designed by SCDA Architects of Singapore, whose principal is Soo K. Chan, the narrow tower will have a facade that recalls the pressed-down buttons on an old-fashioned tape recorder, with sections that are beveled, at slight angles. Each of the 29 units will occupy at least a full floor, making them feel spacious despite the skinny site, said Neo Que Yau, the chief executive of Euro Properties. Most apartments will be configured with two bedrooms, he said, and about half will have views of Central Park. Units will start at about 1,400 square feet. Finishes will include marble for kitchens and baths; there will also be bidet-style toilets, the kind that are popular overseas. But while Mr. Yau said that he welcomed foreign buyers, who have taken a shine to the neighborhood in the current boom, he would not market to them specifically. ""It's a consideration,"" he said, ""not the most important factor."" Demolition of the four-story building that once stood at the site, which Euro Properties bought from the Rudd family for $49 million in 2013 and which once contained a tuxedo-rental company, is complete. Yet the condo, where foundations are scheduled to be poured in June and sales set to begin in September, is a work in progress. As of early this month, Euro Properties was still hammering out details about building amenities, which will include a fitness center, treatment rooms for massages and a lounge with outdoor gardens, Mr. Yau said. He said that prices ""will be consistent with ultraluxury developments in the area."" The much taller and more perk-laden 432 Park Avenue, from Macklowe Properties and the CIM Group, for example, has averaged about $8,000 a square foot for its units so far, according to data from StreetEasy.com.

The new condo by Euro Properties is not that large by Chinese project standards. Oosten, a 216-unit complex that Xin Development Group International is developing, spreads across a full block in South Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Likewise, at 100 East 53rd Street, a team that includes the Chinese investors Vanke Holdings and China Cinda Asset Management, alongside Hines and RFR Holding, is creating a 61-story, 94-apartment high-rise next to the Seagram Building. (The project was previously billed as 610 Lexington Avenue.) Zoning on the site of 118 East 59th allowed a tower of only about 30 stories, according to Mr. Yau, meaning there would have been only a few floors with park views. Yet Euro Properties was ultimately able to climb several floors higher after buying unused development, or ""air"" rights, from the building next door, at No. 116. That kind of transaction has become fairly common, but the neighbor is hardly ordinary. It is the Argosy Book Store, which has refused to sell its home to developers for decades, even as skyscrapers swallowed up similar buildings around it, according to Naomi Hample, an owner. But as the Argosy tries to survive in a battered industry, Ms. Hample finally decided that her family-owned store could part with a bit of its property after all, or at least the air above it, which sold for more than $6 million. ""It was very fortunate,"" she said. Would there be other upsides, like the condo's residents dropping by to snap up hardcovers? No, Ms. Hample said. ""The buyer will be a billionaire who will use it for six weeks a year,"" she said. ""A hotel would have been much better.""","Chinese companies have flocked to build in New York, but always partnered with local firms.",74fab7e7-2b67-5c18-ba3b-934309798262,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/10/realestate/10CHINA/10CHINA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=711cc4b82d2cd3793664fa74de98a789450a244e0039525bb2786a238e0dcc2b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The 38-story tower planned for 118 East 59th Street.,74fab7e7-2b67-5c18-ba3b-934309798262,N24News/imgs/74fab7e7-2b67-5c18-ba3b-934309798262.jpg,7
Style,The Winemaker of Avenue C,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/05/style/wine-manhattan-apartment-avenue-c-new-york-city.html,"Matt Baldassano runs a subscription-only winemaking club called the Village Winery Club, which has about 60 members who pay yearly dues (starting at $200) in exchange for wine and the chance to be part of the process.

Matt Baldassano, 35, works in tech and lives in Alphabet City. So when you hear that he makes wine in his apartment, you may want to roll your eyes. Another hipster practicing the dilettante arts? Rooftop Reds, it seems, are the latest product, after pickles and chocolate, to get the artisanal, made-in-New York treatment. But Mr. Baldassano, who grew up on Staten Island, belongs to an earlier city tradition: that of Italian-Americans making wine in the home. The city's Italian immigrants regularly made their own stuff -- dark, strong reds, mostly -- in basements or bathtubs. During Prohibition, the practice flourished.

""Newspapers of the time reported about the dozen crates that were downloaded and piled outside tenement houses,"" said Simone Cinotto, a scholar and author of the book ""The Italian American Table."" Passers-by, he added, would notice ""the fumes mounting from the basements."" Mr. Baldassano's maternal grandfather, John D'Amato, born in Campobasso, Italy, made his wine in the cellar of his Staten Island home, holding a ritual crush each fall. ""That was his heritage,"" Mr. Baldassano said. ""You get the grapes, you make it yourself."" The process was old-school and inexact. His grandfather used a hand press and destemmed manually. He never bottled the wine, pouring it straight from the barrel instead. Mr. Baldassano's winemaking setup is not a vineyard-to-glass operation. He gets his grapes from the M & M Wine Grape Company, a distributor in Hartford, which brings them in from California, Chile and other wine regions.

""At first we were like, 'How are you pulling this off?' "" said Christina Musto, the vineyard relations manager at M & M Wine Grape Company. ""But he makes an incredible wine. He's really passionate."" For a long time, space was Mr. Baldassano's main concern. He spent two years coveting the huge back patio that went with an apartment downstairs. By his own admission, he cunningly befriended the couple who lived there, as well as their dog, as a way to get the inside track on their apartment. When they moved out, he moved in. Outdoor space is prized in New York, after all, and it is especially important if you plan to produce a drinkable petite syrah. ""The two things you need are outdoor space and an elevator,"" Mr. Baldassano said. ""You can do it indoors -- you just can't live there."" Since 2011 he has produced two vintages a year, spring and fall. His are likely the only reds hailing from Avenue C.

""That's where the grapes get crushed,"" Mr. Baldassano said, pointing to a back corner of the concrete patio, where, until recently, he kept his crusher-destemmer, which, he noted, is ""the Cadillac"" of home crushing machines. Inside the 550-square-foot apartment, stacked against a wall, were four French oak barrels full of wine and, beside them, glass jugs holding the overflow. Nearby, a wine refrigerator chilled bottles of past vintages. There wasn't much room left for, say, furniture.

Brandishing a wine thief (a thin glass tube that extracts wine from the barrel), Mr. Baldassano tested a cabernet that had been aging for about a year. He filled a glass and took a sip. ""I do a topping-off once every few weeks,"" he said. ""This is about ready."" Because he is forbidden by New York State law to sell his homemade wine, Mr. Baldassano started Village Winery Club, which has about 60 members who pay yearly dues (starting at $200) in exchange for wine and the chance to be part of the process. The club holds events like a fall crush and a bottling day, and invites chefs to pair foods with its wines. It also gives Mr. Baldassano a healthy outlet for his obsession. He can talk for hours about yeast or the scouting trips he has made to wineries in the Suisun Valley in California.

""Listen, if I didn't hold back, I would fail quickly,"" he said, shaking his head. ""I wouldn't have enough money for barrels."" So far Mr. Baldassano has produced, among others, a malbec, a primitivo and a pinotage from South African grapes. Last year, the distributor called with news that an excellent black moscato grape had come in, and he put 20 boxes on his order. ""That was my first rose,"" Mr. Baldassano said. ""It's not light and delicate. It's a full-bodied rose. It's a rose you would have with a hamburger."" Drinking wine made in a city apartment seems like a dicey proposition. One thinks of maceration and fermentation and the delicate science of viticulture, compared with the essential chaos of New York. Nevertheless, Mr. Baldassano has earned raves for his wines. ""The reds are fantastic,"" said Brandon Tarbert, a Village Winery Club member who said he was ""blown away"" when he first heard a guy in Alphabet City was making wine. ""The carmenere Matt did -- I bought every bottle I could.""

About 25 members crammed in to drink wine from previous years and inspect this fall's grapes before they were destemmed for the fermentation and bottling process. Mr. Baldassano had rigged a ""crush cam"" so that members could watch the noisy pulverizing on a big-screen TV. He also placed a tub on the floor for a ceremonial foot crushing. The basement did not exactly have the romance of Napa (Mr. Baldassano had to cover an overhead pipe with wound rope to protect his guests from bumping their heads), but it fit the spirit.

Fashion & Style,Tim Kaine's Dad Style Makes a Statement in Philadelphia,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/fashion/tim-kaine-democratic-national-convention.html,"Can we talk, for a minute, about the men? Not so much President Obama, who in his appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday was as polished and powerful as ever, extolling the American myth and passing the torch of leadership to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama recast himself in the role of elder statesman, complete with silver tie, to match the hair that has silvered in office. Not so much Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, now an Independent as demonstrated by his neither red nor blue but purple tie, who pointedly declared his allegiance to Mrs. Clinton and called her opponent, Donald J. Trump, a ""dangerous demagogue."" Not even former President Bill Clinton, who has a complicated road ahead of him building an image of a first man (first spouse?) and who chose, on Tuesday night, the current default Washington option that once upon a time was Mr. Obama's trademark look: dark suit, white shirt, blue tie. But Tim Kaine. Over the last few nights of the Democratic convention, which was chockablock with national figures, his image was not like the others. It stood out for a reason.

Whenever I write about how women in the political arena dress, I inevitably get accusations of sexism and a number of responses along the lines of: ""Who cares how they dress, you should be writing about what they say!"" It's true that I write about women more than men. But that is because women have more choice in the matter, because they have more choice in general: For them, clothing can become a weapon and a tool in a way it cannot for men, whose options are meaningfully more limited.

That's an asset for a female politician (and happily, the current crop of female leaders are starting to use it), though we tend to tar it as a negative and though all those decisions can also be a pain. Men really have only the tie and their off-duty wear to telegraph individuality. And, as has been clear over the last few nights in Philadelphia, a kind of general aura that is hard to pin down but creates an impression. That's where Mr. Kaine has come in. Of all the male power speakers at the convention thus far, he was the least tailored. In fact, he looked kind of schlubby. In his gray suit, which pulled and bunched when he waved his arms, his dull blue shirt, and his tie with the wide red, dark gray and blue stripes that somehow matched his shirt and blended the two together, he looked like the anti-image-consultant guy. And I bet that is all to the good. After all, it is partly the point.

Mr. Kaine may have a lot of experience in government (he does), and foreign policy and military cred (he does), all of which were most material in his selection as vice-presidential candidate, but he is also unshowy; he's the normal guy, in contrast to a woman in extraordinary circumstances. The one who doesn't wear designer duds. The one everyone who doesn't relate to Mrs. Clinton can relate to. At least, in those clothes he was. Just consider some of the Twitter reaction:

And the answer to the question in that last tweet: Yes. Mr. Kaine's role is not unlike the one that Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his too-big suits played for Mitt Romney in 2012, when Mr. Ryan was the guy's guy, the one that brought Mr. Romney down to earth, the -- as Noreen Malone wrote in the New Republic -- ""Midwestern boy next door suddenly thrust into this crazy political world."" Mr. Kaine is the visual yin to Mrs. Clinton's yang. When you are pitching yourself as the big-tent candidate, you need to make the case every way you can. On Wednesday, the vice-presidential nominee was a meaningful part of that narrative before he even spoke a word.","Men are not exempt from the political dress game, and on Wednesday the vice-presidential candidate played his role to perfection.",7c389c2a-5067-5efc-a3e6-185cc79b6e84,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/31/fashion/31OTR/31OTR-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3cc32d6d6002366971e3bce94c530ca38cbafc629dcd2e6274f0611ff4ca4da6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Tim Kaine was not a tailored power speaker in Philadelphia.,7c389c2a-5067-5efc-a3e6-185cc79b6e84,N24News/imgs/7c389c2a-5067-5efc-a3e6-185cc79b6e84.jpg,19
Sports,LeBron James and Anthony Davis Sign Up for Lakers' Bright Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/sports/basketball/lebron-james-anthony-davis-lakers.html,"The Los Angeles Lakers have secured a long-term future with their two most important players by agreeing to new contracts on successive days this week with Anthony Davis and LeBron James.

The Lakers and Davis agreed on a five-year, $190 million maximum contract, Rich Paul of Klutch Sports, the agent for both Davis and James, said on Thursday. On Wednesday, James and the Lakers agreed to a two-year maximum contract extension worth nearly $86 million, Paul said.

Davis, 27, became an unrestricted free agent after helping the Lakers win the franchise's 17th championship in October, but he did not negotiate with any other team. After taking some time to consider a variety of contract lengths, Davis accepted the longest deal he could with Los Angeles. It includes a player option that grants him the right to return to free agency after the 2023-24 season.

James, who turns 36 later this month, also took the longest deal he could without invoking the N.B.A.'s over-38 rule, which restricts older players from signing multiyear deals. He previously had a player option for the 2021-22 season, but is now under contract with the Lakers through the 2022-23 season -- via the first contract extension he has signed with his incumbent team since he signed an extension with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who drafted him, in 2006.","The N.B.A. champions signed their two most important players to new or longer contracts on successive days, after upgrading other areas of their roster.",3c3d6d19-3d11-5f88-8bd2-28568f1dd39e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/04/sports/04nba-lakers-1/03nba-lakers-1-facebookJumbo.jpg,LeBron James and Anthony Davis led the Los Angeles Lakers to a championship this October in their first season together.,3c3d6d19-3d11-5f88-8bd2-28568f1dd39e,N24News/imgs/3c3d6d19-3d11-5f88-8bd2-28568f1dd39e.jpg,9
Movies,'Proud Mary' Has a 'Proud Mary' Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/movies/proud-mary-john-fogerty-taraji-p-henson.html,"Anyway, what's playing for most of the sequence is Mr. Fogerty's song -- not his canonical Creedence version but Ike and Tina Turner's. That arrangement departs radically but respectfully from Mr. Fogerty's. It starts with an overture in which Tina tells us how she and Ike and the Ikettes are going to take this thing from modesty to explosive overstatement (""You see, we never ever do nothing nice and easy"") before she blasts off. ""Rollin' on the river,"" yes. But when she's singing, powerboatin' on it, too. It's such a tone-deaf misappropriation of music that it left me feeling litigious.

There's nothing legally wrong going on here, though. Screen Gems, the Sony imprint that produced and released the movie, paid for use of the song, whose rights don't belong to Mr. Fogerty. But the incompetence really is something. Or maybe it's the obviousness. Maybe it's the inevitability. The whole movie seems to exist just for this sequence. Even if I'd paid just to see Ms. Henson mow down gangs of goons (and I probably did pay only for that), I didn't get my money's worth. It's like I bought a can that said ""peaches,"" got peaches in the can, but the can was rusty, so the peaches were, too.

Movies and television have a way of using a soundtrack not just to create a mood but to literalize it. You could always count on a master class in splitting the difference between artistry and obviousness during the so-called Blaxploitation era (which ""Proud Mary"" practically pulls a muscle reaching back to evoke). ""Shaft"" and ""Superfly,"" on the one hand. On the other, ""Coffy is the color of your skin/Coffy is the world you live in.""

For its part, in a statement to Entertainment Weekly, Screen Gems made Mr. Fogerty an entreaty: Come see the movie! ""He would see"" the statement reads, ""that his complaint that the film has nothing to do with the song's message as 'a metaphor about leaving painful, stressful things behind for a more tranquil and meaningful life' is inaccurate. That is precisely what our Mary is looking to do, and Taraji nails it perfectly.""

They're not wrong. But come on. Mary winds up taking her self-inflicted babysitting assignment so seriously (I won't spoil the details) that she actually has no choice but to leave the stress behind.

Now, I know what somebody involved with this movie was thinking. The screenplay seems as if it's been kicking around for who knows how long (Pam Grier could have done this in 1973, title and all), and maybe it used to be called something else. But it's ""Proud Mary"" now, and Mary is a black woman -- and when was the last time a black woman, who isn't Halle Berry, carried any movie by herself, let alone one in which she keeps an arsenal hidden in her walk-in closet, not far from her wigs, one that lets her do the old shoot-and-slide along a warehouse floor? This really is a kind of momentous occasion, and for that you need a momentous song, and ""Proud Mary"" more than satisfies the occasion. Every time I hear Ms. Turner spit out the word ""left"" or sing ""burnin'"" or ""all right!,"" I want to fight to ensure voting rights. I want to karate chop something.

So it all makes a kind of sense, right? Let's honor the occasion with a song worthy of it. The occasion might warrant this song. The movie is a different story. Leaning on the Ike and Tina version might bring it into better, blacker alignment with the star, but it addresses neither the central incongruity (Why use this song for a massacre? Why use it for a massacre this badly orchestrated?) nor the artistic injustice of Mr. Fogerty's complaint. There are bullet holes in walls, tire treads on mobsters, and now bullet holes and tire treads all over his song.","Movies misuse music all the time. The Taraji P.

Travel,Hotels That Rival Nearby Theme Parks,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/travel/theme-parks-hotels-resorts.html,"Hotels near theme parks do more than offer a convenient respite from the lines and crowds. Largely aimed at families, the most elaborate of them operate as park extensions, with immersive design and enough amenities to ensure that you can retire to your room after a busy day and won't have to leave it again till morning. The following new and improved resorts champion proximity and entertainment, and many come with perks such as free shuttles to the theme park, on-site ticket sales, early park admission and line-jumping status.

For extra immersion into the world of brick-built characters, the Legoland Hotel at Legoland California Resort has introduced rooms themed after the Lego Friends collection of cartoon character girls from fictional Heartlake City. The 12 rooms, which sleep up to five, include an adult bed and either a pull-out trundle or bunk beds, a beach-house-themed bathroom and Lego bricks, of course.

Real Estate,Priced Out of Brooklyn? Try Manhattan,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/realestate/priced-out-of-brooklyn-try-manhattan.html,"Five years ago, Eric Kabakoff and Christina Lewandowski bought a one-bedroom in a new condominium in Gowanus, Brooklyn, with the idea of moving to a two-bedroom in the same building after a while. But two years ago, when they were outbid on two apartments there, the couple realized their $750,000 budget was not going to be enough. Widening their search, the couple were pleasantly surprised to find prices within their reach in an area of New York they had not initially considered: Manhattan. Last spring they purchased a two-bedroom co-op a block from Central Park in Carnegie Hill on the Upper East Side. ""It took a while for us to decide to leave,"" said Mr. Kabakoff, a marketing director and author. ""It's just we got priced out of Brooklyn and, ironically, into Manhattan."" Brooklyn real estate prices have become so high that parts of Manhattan are starting to look like bargains.

The median sales price in Brooklyn hit a record $610,894 in the first quarter of this year, marking the first time the median crossed the $600,000 threshold in the borough, according to a report prepared by the appraiser Jonathan J. Miller for the brokerage firm Douglas Elliman. That is still less expensive overall than Manhattan, where the median sales price was $970,000 for the same period, but apartments in certain Manhattan neighborhoods can be had for less. From left, Ms. Adams's former home in Dumbo, and the couple's new and less expensive home in the East 50s near the East River. Robert Wright for The New York Times The best deals can be found along Manhattan's edges, in areas like Washington Heights, Inwood and Morningside Heights. In these northerly neighborhoods, the median sales price for co-ops and condos in the first quarter was less than $500,000. And as some buyers have discovered, Manhattan neighborhoods where the median sales price is more than $1 million, such as the financial district and Sutton Place, can be less expensive than Dumbo and Vinegar Hill, sought-after Brooklyn areas where the median sales price is $1,275,000. And forget about the quintessential brownstone in decent condition in northern Brooklyn unless you are prepared to shell out around $2 million. Competition from deep-pocketed investors, combined with a scarcity of listings, means even people whose Brooklyn apartments have appreciated in price are having a difficult time finding something nearby they can afford, especially if they're looking for more space. ""If you bought something early on for $500,000 and now it's $1 million,"" Mr. Miller said, your newfound wealth is just ""money on paper"" because ""everything around you in Brooklyn has also seen that growth.""

For a three-bedroom, she said, ""I'd have to go up to $2.5 million or $3 million or $4 million."" Going deeper into Brooklyn required trade-offs they weren't willing to make, like contending with a longer commute or disappointing schools, said Ms. Fein, who grew up on the Upper West Side. So the couple turned to Upper Manhattan. ""We just thought we could get so much more for our money,"" she said. In Hudson Heights, they found a 1,400-square-foot co-op with two bedrooms, two baths, an eat-in kitchen and a dining room listed for $899,000. They moved in last month. Though not a three-bedroom, the place is almost double the size of the Boerum Hill apartment. While their new environs lack the variety of restaurants and boutiques they enjoyed in their old neighborhood, the couple like the family-oriented vibe, the proximity of Fort Tryon Park and the many prewar apartment buildings.

""It sort of reminded me of my neighborhood growing up, after it wasn't dangerous, but before Whole Foods went in,"" Ms. Fein said. The best part, she added, is that ""there is not a huge difference between what we paid and what our broker says we could list our apartment in Brooklyn for."" Buyers who are willing to do some renovating or give up some amenities are finding they can afford a Manhattan address a bit more to the south. The Carnegie Hill two-bedroom that Mr. Kabakoff, 39, and Ms. Lewandowski, 45, bought needed a new kitchen, wood floors and the removal of layer upon layer of old paint. But after crunching the numbers, the couple realized they could afford the work. ""We knew that the market was favorable for selling in Brooklyn, and if we sold high and bought low we could put any profit into renovations,"" Mr. Kabakoff said. ""When all was said and done, we knew we'd have a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan, which you can't argue with."" From left, the Bushwick, Brooklyn, building Ms. Garcia Diaz-Pines and Mr. O'Connell used to live in, and their new one on the Upper East Side. Robert Wright for The New York Times Ms. Lewandowski, who works in human resources, added, ""We pinch ourselves every day. We can't believe how lucky we are. We walk our dog in Central Park."" Plenty of people, however, would rather head deeper into Brooklyn than consider a move to Manhattan. Others are discovering the qualities that initially drew them to Brooklyn persist in Manhattan's sleepier precincts, possibly at better prices. Eight years ago, in search of a peaceful neighborhood, Cornelia Adams found an $810,000 two-bedroom loft in Dumbo, which hugs the waterfront between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.

After a fruitless ""boroughwide search,"" Ms. Goldberg suggested she consider Manhattan. Ms. Adams was hesitant, not knowing ""if I can afford it,"" she said. Ultimately, she made money on the move. In November, she bought a two-bedroom, one-bath in the Beekman Place area with windows on three sides, herringbone floors and a working fireplace for $840,000. Earlier this year, she and Kavi Ohri, 50, who works in the music industry, moved in and were married there. The neighborhood, an out-of-the-way enclave between First Avenue and the East River, meets her standard for quiet. ""It's almost like the land that time forgot,"" she said. Brooklyn came into its own as a primary destination only recently. ""For people coming into the city, the default was Manhattan first: 'If we can't afford it, we'll go to Brooklyn,' "" Mr. Miller said. But now, ""Brooklyn, in many aspects, is a true competitor of Manhattan.""

Reflecting this shift are the instructions prospective buyers give to agents. ""I have a client looking in both Brooklyn and the Upper East Side,"" said Kristen Larkin, a saleswoman at Town Residential. ""To get the price they want to spend, they would have to go pretty far into Brooklyn or they could live on the Upper East Side. It's pretty interesting when you think of it in those terms: You could live in the Upper East Side of Manhattan or Kensington or Sunset Park.""

For some Brooklynites, the idea that they can afford a place in Manhattan is still a head spinner. ""I always thought the West Village was a dream out of reach,"" said Meredith Krantz, 38, who works in advertising and sales in Manhattan. In 2005, she paid $399,000 for a one-bedroom with a working fireplace and a private roof deck on the fourth floor of a walk-up in Boerum Hill because, ""it was so much more livable than what I was seeing in Manhattan."" In March she listed her place for $585,000. It quickly went into contract for $615,000. ""For nine and a half years that was a pretty good profit,"" said Ms. Krantz, who is putting her proceeds toward a $650,000 studio in an elevator building on West 12th Street in Manhattan. While she is saying goodbye to outdoor space and a fireplace, Ms. Krantz will not miss the commute or the climb up three flights of stairs.

""When I close, I will be able to walk to work,"" she said. Renters are also finding Manhattan can sometimes offer better values than Brooklyn, where a steady stream of young professionals willing to pay ever more has helped push the median monthly rent to $2,893 in March. That is up more than 30 percent from the median of $2,200 five years ago, according to Miller Samuel. In Manhattan, the median rent was $3,395 in March. Development has also contributed to higher Brooklyn rents, as glass and steel high-rises have sprouted in Williamsburg, Greenpoint and Downtown. ""With more and more neighborhood amenities and full-service living options coming to the Brooklyn waterfront, New Yorkers looking for high-end rentals are increasingly seeing Manhattan and Brooklyn on equal footing,"" said Ashley Wirkus, the director of residential leasing for Two Trees Management Company, a real estate development firm based in Dumbo with developments in both Brooklyn and Manhattan. Some apartments in its Brooklyn portfolio now outpace Manhattan. A 967-square-foot two-bedroom, two-bath in Dumbo offering water views including three bridges and Lower Manhattan recently rented for $7,020 a month at 60 Water Street, a glassy tower with 232 market-rate apartments.

A similarly sized two-bedroom, two-bath with Hudson River views rented for $6,050 a month on the western edge of Manhattan at Mercedes House, an 850-unit apartment complex at 550 West 54th Street. Both buildings were developed by Two Trees Management, though Mercedes House has more amenities, including a screening room and a high-end fitness club with sun decks, a spa and indoor and outdoor pools. There are lifestyle choices to consider when weighing trade-offs. Last June, Elena Garcia Diaz-Pines left a $2,100-a-month one-bedroom on the Upper East Side for a $2,480-a-month two-bedroom in Bushwick, Brooklyn, splitting the rent with her boyfriend, Sean O'Connell, 29, a motion graphic designer. ""In my mind, I thought, it will be quieter; the apartment will be bigger. I'll sacrifice the amenities of the Upper East Side, but there will be a lot of pluses,"" said Ms. Diaz-Pines, 24, an account executive at an advertising agency in Manhattan. ""That didn't really happen."" From left, the Gowanus, Brooklyn, building that Mr. Kabakoff and Ms. Lewandowski used to live in and their new one in Carnegie Hill. Robert Wright for The New York Times The couple's new apartment was slightly larger, but they soon discovered that for what they were paying, the apartment had a lot of minuses. ""Thin walls, drafty windows, and a general feeling of being in the middle of nowhere for so much money,"" said Ms. Diaz-Pines, who missed basic conveniences such as a nearby pharmacy. ""All you have around you are delis and health food stores,"" she said. So with their lease renewal approaching, the couple went back to the Upper East Side. Last month, with the help of Angel Dominguez, a saleswoman at Citi Habitats, they found a newly renovated one-bedroom in Yorkville for $2,395 a month. Even though it is somewhat smaller than their two-bedroom in Bushwick, ""it's quiet, brand-new and close to so many more things,"" said Ms. Diaz-Pines, noting her new dry cleaner, supermarket and nearby John Jay Park. Her takeaway from the experience: ""If anything, you go to Brooklyn for a different lifestyle. I don't think it's true at all anymore that you go to Brooklyn for a better deal.""

Recognizing an opportunity, at least one developer is hoping to lure current and potential Brooklynites to Manhattan with stylish accommodations like those that have proved so popular at the new Brooklyn towers. At 245 East 80th Street, a 110-unit building, A & E Real Estate Holdings is giving vacant apartments a serious makeover. Parquet floors are becoming white oak and dated kitchens are receiving upgraded appliances and finishes. Leasing is expected to begin in June. Rent is still being determined. The company that will handle leasing and marketing, aptsandlofts.com, is based in Brooklyn, and was hired for the project partly because of its experience in that borough, said its founder, David J. Maundrell III. ""Basically, they reached out to us because they felt we have access to people who moved to Brooklyn and may want to move back to Manhattan,"" Mr. Maundrell said. ""The Upper East Side is a pocket of Manhattan where you can still get value compared to other places downtown in the city, and at times, in Brooklyn. ""I do think we are going to be able to move people back to the city, so to speak.""",Brooklyn home prices have become so high that parts of Manhattan are starting to look like bargains.,864b6020-b339-5274-a874-60b842553935,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/10/realestate/10COV1/10COV1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=cf7d8670a85c63529783f0b3ee9e825bd15df0f84c060ceff8bc482747dbfe4c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kavi Ohri and Cornelia Adams moved to Manhattan after deciding Dumbo, Brooklyn, had become what Ms. Adams describes as ""a circus.""",864b6020-b339-5274-a874-60b842553935,N24News/imgs/864b6020-b339-5274-a874-60b842553935.jpg,7
Books,Revisiting Diana Athill: 'The Doyenne of English Book Editors',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/books/review/diana-athill-stet.html,"Lena Dunham appraises the legacy of Diana Athill, who died last month, in this week's issue. In 2001, the author Evelyn Toynton reviewed Athill's memoir ""Stet"" for the Book Review.

""I often wondered whether other businesses above the level of sweated labor imposed on their personnel the degree of discomfort we got away with. The country seemed to teem with people, most of them young women, so eager to work with books that they would endure poverty and pain to do so: a situation which we certainly exploited."" Thus does Diana Athill, the doyenne of English book editors, characterize the working conditions at Andre Deutsch, the distinguished publishing house she helped to found shortly after World War II. Athill, now 83 years old, has made a name for herself not only as one of the most discerning editors of the postwar period but also as an almost unnervingly cleareyed memoirist. In books like ""After a Funeral"" (1986) and ""Make Believe"" (1993), she refused to romanticize madness, sex, revolutionary politics or even her own motives. Now, in ""Stet,"" she has written a memoir of her life in publishing.

Despite the reference to sweated labor, anyone gloomy about the current ""market orientation"" of publishers is likely to feel wistful when reading Athill's description of the early, chaotic years with Deutsch: ""Even in those book-hungry days we would have had to go far to find a piece of fiction more obviously unsalable than those stories, yet once I had pronounced them good we didn't think twice about publishing them."" While she claims to have been wholly unqualified to be a publisher -- ""all I have ever been able to do with money is spend it; I loathe responsibility and telling people what to do; and above all I am incapable of selling anything to anyone"" -- she had near impeccable editorial judgment.

Under her guidance Deutsch was the first to publish V. S. Naipaul, Brian Moore and Mordecai Richler, among others, and the first British publisher of John Updike, Philip Roth and Margaret Atwood. She also played a significant role in the re-emergence of Jean Rhys and Molly Keane, both of whom, after long silence, published new novels in their old age that brought them the acclaim that had earlier been denied them. The publishing world may no longer be hospitable to editors like Athill; we have to ask what the loss of the breed is likely to cost the rest of us.","In her memoir ""Stet,"" the editor behind writers such as V.S. Naipaul and Jean Rhys reflected on her life in publishing.",25b1a361-1a29-5cde-9761-8a866a327102,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/books/review/24DUNHAM-PRINT/24DUNHAM-PRINT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=76c1c081b448397ce6cf31207d47b4f7683958b67590548a0debbe5766777802&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Diana Athill in 1939.,25b1a361-1a29-5cde-9761-8a866a327102,N24News/imgs/25b1a361-1a29-5cde-9761-8a866a327102.jpg,13
Dance,A Dancing Spirit Makes 'Little Women' Wild at Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/arts/dance/dancing-in-little-women-monica-bill-barnes.html,"Even before the dancing starts, there's something about the way she runs. Near the beginning of ""Little Women,"" Saoirse Ronan takes off. Cutting her way through a soberly dressed crowd, she flies across the pavement -- blond waves bouncing -- her face lit from within by a private smile. Her flapping coat makes it look as though she's soaring on wings. She's both of the earth and air; grounded yet light. The reason Greta Gerwig's ""Little Women"" is so fresh and so piercingly alive? Its dancing spirit, in which even a run is a choreographic act. In this adaptation of Louisa May Alcott's novel about four sisters growing up in New England during and after the Civil War, Ronan, as the willful Jo, has physical prowess: She's sharp, she's spontaneous and she's more than a little bit wild. As the close-knit March sisters -- Meg, Jo, Beth and Amy -- glide and tumble their way through the story, Gerwig orchestrates a kind of choreography that is as much physical as verbal. The actors have a way of bursting through space -- and piling on one another, both in love and in anger -- so that you're able to feel their three-dimensional fullness. What Gerwig cultivates visually is choreographic pandemonium: restless, energetic and a hair shy of full-blown chaos.

And she makes spaces for actual dances -- short, though never slight, gems -- that were created by the contemporary choreographer Monica Bill Barnes. Flannery Gregg, a member of her company, is the associate choreographer. Whether obvious or not, dance and its inherent musicality provide subtext for everything in ""Little Women"" -- even the approach to dialogue. In an episode of IndieWire's Filmmaker Toolkit podcast, Gerwig spoke about how she used slash marks to indicate when the next character would enter with a line so she could create the right speed and cadence. She described it as a technique for the actors to master. ""It's like being a dancer,"" she said. ""You find the freedom in the structure."" It's the same with a film that dances: Gerwig's clear cinematic frame allows her to take risks with her approach to movement and to show something of a character's inner world. When we first see Laurie, played by Timothee Chalamet, he is captured in a slow-motion walk that makes it seem as if he were drifting over water. Chalamet's Laurie, especially in the film's first half, is something of a sprite; is it strange to say that his portrayal is in line with the hypnotizing spirit of the New York City Ballet dancer Allegra Kent? He has a loose silkiness, which makes his control -- evident in his ability to balance and turn -- so bewitching, especially the way it contrasts with Ronan's rough-and-tumble fearlessness. Her physicality is straightforward in its strength; his is imbued with mystery.

Their duet is set to Dvorak in the film. But there's a reason the actors appear to be so playfully modern: All of the dances were made using contemporary music. The porch dance was actually created to James Brown's ""Give It Up or Turnit a Loose"" (from the live recording of ""Revolution of the Mind""). The sparkling look of the dance isn't just about the feverish way they execute the steps, but it's also about the musicality: We may not hear James Brown, but his timeless groove haunts this dance like a ghost. In an interview, Barnes said Gerwig told her she wanted viewers to leave the movie feeling as if they had just heard David Bowie. (In the film, ""Frances Ha,"" Gerwig plays the heroine, a dancer; in one scene, she runs -- just as exuberantly as Ronan does in ""Little Women""-- through the streets of Manhattan, leaping and spinning to Bowie's ""Modern Love."") For Barnes that meant the film ""has this contemporary feeling,"" she said, ""even though nothing indicates that in the costume or the music."" That contemporary feeling is a triple threat: a weaving of physicality, the cadence of voices and even of fabric. The costumes, with their layered effect, seem to reference dance rehearsal clothes, from scarves draped loosely around necks to wrapped sweaters and chunky socks that have the look of leg warmers. And Bowie's music is there, if under the surface; ""Let's Dance"" and ""The Man Who Sold the World"" were used when making the sequences featuring Meg at the debutante ball. But Barnes's overall approach was to try to find ""a way to make the story seem not so distant,"" she said. ""I wanted to find the right music to shape the energy of the scenes and of the dancing.""

A beer hall is the site of another electric dance, this one pairing Ronan and Louis Garrel as Friedrich Bhaer, the professor Jo meets while living in New York. Here, Barnes plays with the lively galop step; to choreograph it, she matched the movement to Aretha Franklin's ""Think."" The result is a thrilling, spiraling dance that spins the couple until you feel their inhibitions melting. Barnes is adept at stripping away artifice and creating a safe and unpretentious space for non-dancers to move, as she did with her company's collaboration with Ira Glass (""Three Acts, Two Dances, One Radio Host"") and in ""The Museum Workout,"" which led spectators on a physical tour of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. You were sweating by the end.

Her experiments and the sense of community that she creates are palpable in moments of ""Little Women"" -- namely that swirling beer hall dance, in which Ronan and Garrel are united by the joyful, intoxicating force of a turn. And then, just as quickly, it's over. Dances bubble up and disappear in the movie, leaving behind glowing fragments of sensation. Throughout, Gerwig celebrates her characters both in action and in stillness. In the final moment, Jo watches as her book is meticulously being made -- with glue and a needle and thread -- at the printer. Here, as Jo chooses writing over marriage, Ronan performs the last dance. Holding the book, a satisfying shade of red, she squeezes her fingers around its cover with as much raw emotion as she poured into those ferocious, pounding jumps on the porch. It's the simplest of motions, barely perceptible, but it synthesizes her pride and her grit. No touch is little in ""Little Women,"" where choreography is its sweeping force and where every movement counts.","Movement is a priority in Greta Gerwig's bold, physicalized look at the March sisters. Some secret ingredients? James Brown and David Bowie.",06e998c9-5614-561b-a3f0-9cccb503262a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/24/arts/24dancing-little-women-4/24dancing-little-women-4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a9299b4b9d57e012316a30c741c348f6bdb310c39ea119f48b1caf34e2580f3e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Grounded yet light: Saoirse Ronan's Jo, on the move in ""Little Women.""",06e998c9-5614-561b-a3f0-9cccb503262a,N24News/imgs/06e998c9-5614-561b-a3f0-9cccb503262a.jpg,6

A mixed-use, seven-story elevator building completed in 2017, with a black-and-gold facade covered by ornate lettering created by the Los Angeles street artist Cryptik, is available on the Lower East Side. Quarters, owned by the Berlin-based co-living operator Medici Living Group, holds a master lease for the residential portion until 2027.

Theater,A Murdered Spy's Widow Relives Her Loss Onstage,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/theater/very-expensive-poison-litvinenko-lucy-prebble.html,"LONDON -- In November 2006, Marina Litvinenko watched her husband, Alexander, die in a London hospital. The Russian spy -turned-whistle-blower -- whom she called Sasha -- had drunk green tea laced with the radioactive element polonium. President Vladimir V. Putin probably approved the murder, a public inquiry in Britain later said. Last Friday, Ms. Litvinenko went to London's Old Vic Theater to watch ""A Very Expensive Poison,"" a new play by Lucy Prebble, running through Oct. 5. She knew she would have to watch her husband die again. In a telephone interview the morning after the performance, Ms. Litvinenko recalled how, as she sat in the theater beforehand, a woman walked up to her, shook her hand and said, ""I think you're very brave."" ""I didn't know for which reason,"" Ms. Litvinenko said -- ""for coming and watching the play, or fighting for Sasha.""

Ms. Litvinenko said she had felt nervous going to the theater, partly because she didn't know what to expect. There had been several documentaries about her husband's murder, but never a play. The only previous dramatization was screened on Russian state television, she said. In it, Mr. Litvinenko was poisoned by another critic of the Kremlin. Ms. Litvinenko said she had been nervous for another reason, too. ""I want these people, this play, to succeed,"" she said. ""I want people to understand its message.""

Two weeks before Ms. Litvinenko went to see the play, Ms. Prebble, the playwright, sat in an office at the Old Vic Theater and pulled a bemused face at two glasses of water that had been left for her on a table. ""It's difficult to not be a little bit paranoid now,"" she said. ""I feel a little bit like I shouldn't drink something that's already been poured for me."" It has been a decade since Ms. Prebble became the talk of British theater with ""Enron,"" a play that told the story of the American energy company's implosion, and that featured song and dance numbers and even, at one point, dinosaurs . ""Enron"" was a hit in the West End, but closed on Broadway after just one week.

The idea for ""A Very Expensive Poison"" came to her by surprise in 2017, Ms. Prebble said. Lately, she has been writing mostly for television (notably the HBO family drama ""Succession""), and she felt she might be through with theater, she said. But then the Old Vic sent her a copy of a book about the Litvinenko case. Ms. Prebble said she was only a short way through it when she felt she had to write a play about it. And she knew instantly how to do it.

She decided to tell the complex story of Mr. Litvinenko's life and murder by having the character investigate his own death , with Mr. Putin trying to direct the action, or at least divert the audience's attention from the truth, from the sidelines. Ms. Prebble said she was also drawn to the love story behind the news event. ""I was touched by the immense loss to Marina,"" she said. ""She was not just dealing with a bereavement, which is terrible enough already, she was dealing with it being a murder, and then she's dealing with the political machinations of it."" After the murder, Ms. Litvinenko fought for years for an inquest, then a public inquiry, into her husband's death, despite successive British governments blocking her efforts. She was as driven in her fight to expose Russian wrongdoing as her husband had been, Ms. Prebble said. ""I thought what Marina did was tremendously moving,"" she said. ""She sort of carried on his fight."" The writer met Ms. Litvinenko several times while researching the play, she said. The first was in a basement cafe of the London bookshop where Mr. Litvinenko used to meet his handler from the British secret service. Ms. Prebble worried that she might lose her sense of professional distance, she said, but that doesn't seem to have happened: In the play, Mr. Litvinenko is sometimes portrayed as overly proud, or dangerously obsessed.

The play, Ms. Prebble said, has several messages: about Russian politics , about how governments in the West overlook murders like Mr. Litvinenko's for economic or political reasons , and about male pride. But the main one, she said, is that a family suffered, and that no matter how absurd these events seem, they're personal. ""After I met Marina a number of times, I did feel a personal connection to her,"" Ms. Prebble said. ""I wanted to do justice to how she spoke about Sasha."" Last Friday at the Old Vic, Ms. Litvinenko eventually sat down to watch her life with Alexander onstage -- both the happy times and the tragic ones. Ms. Litvinenko said she was amazed by the actor MyAnna Buring's portrayal of her. ""MyAnna took everything from me: how she moved, how she talked, how she looked,"" she said.","Lucy Prebble's new play, ""A Very Expensive Poison,"" dramatizes the assassination of Alexander Litvinenko.

From Guillermo del Toro, this lavish love story between a mute cleaning woman, played by Sally Hawkins, and a scaly amphibian man, played by Doug Jones, is part of a grand tradition of human-monster cinematic bodice rippers.

Why you should swipe left: You're afraid of heights. The Monster in 'Young Frankenstein.' Age: Depends on the Body Part.

I'm good with children, unless they startle me. Other fears include fire. Fire bad! If you like a cultured, sophisticated man about town, I might be the guy you're looking for. Just ask me and I'll perform my foot-stomping version of ""Puttin' on the Ritz."" I'm not what you'd call a clothes horse, but I'm as comfortable in a tuxedo as I am in casual wear. My friends would describe me as having an electrifying personality. Why you should swipe right: One of my exes said I helped her find the sweet mystery of life. Why you should swipe left: Baldists need not apply. The Beast in 'Beauty and the Beast.' Age: 20.

I live in a huge castle, and I'm really into interior decorating and antiques. It's filled with vintage teacups, armoires, clocks and candelabras. All the better for a romantic dinner at home. I must confess, though, that my table manners could use a little work. I love to read, and I hope you do, too. I've got a library full of books, and I'm happy to share. My posse calls me an old-fashioned romantic. In fact, I've got a special rose waiting for the woman who can win my heart.

Call me out of step with the times, but I'm a skilled ballroom dancer. I would love to waltz with someone special. A word of warning: If you're not into guys with lots of body hair, I'm probably not the one for you. However, I'm happy to cover up my furry physique with formal attire. So would you like to be my guest for dinner? Why you should swipe right: If we hit it off, you're welcome to stay at my pad indefinitely. Why you should swipe left: I'm not looking for a hookup.",The love story between Sally Hawkins's character and amphibian man is part of a grand tradition of cinematic human-monster romances.

Technology,Continue Your Life's Education With Free Online Classes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/technology/personaltech/education-free-online-classes.html,"Have extra time at home? Want to keep your brain busy with new things to think about? Consider doing a little remote learning of your own. After all, Benjamin Franklin famously set aside an hour or two each day to study, reflect and experiment so he could fill in the gaps in his own education, and he went on to several successful careers.

Hundreds of major colleges and universities offer online courses that anyone with an internet connection can take. While you won't get academic credits for taking free classes, you expand your knowledge -- and can even show a little solidarity with your children as they head back to school themselves. Here's a guide to getting started.

First, ask yourself what subject you want to study and how it might benefit you. Are you pondering a career shift? Looking to pick up new skills? Or do you just need a distraction in unsettled times? Make a note of your ultimate goal to help focus your search, as classes are available across a wide range of academic disciplines.","If you're pondering a career shift, looking to learn a specific skill or just plain bored, consider a web-based class to broaden your horizons.",da15dfd8-f036-50e8-a49b-1668135ad030,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/09/technology/personaltech/09TECHTIP-TOP/09TECHTIP-TOP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=a9fb625d9c8cb252e0166f3b05f1aa233697916d8cc211e5a3ac4195284cd2cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Free online classes can widen your knowledge and skill set, even if you don't earn academic credit toward a degree.",da15dfd8-f036-50e8-a49b-1668135ad030,N24News/imgs/da15dfd8-f036-50e8-a49b-1668135ad030.jpg,20
Movies,'River City Drumbeat' Review: A Community's Pulse Proves Strong,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/movies/river-city-drumbeat-review.html,"River City Drum Corp -- the grass-roots community center at the heart of this profile from the filmmakers Marlon Johnson and Anne Flatte -- offers drum classes for children from early childhood to their high school graduation. Its founder, White, recalls building the center from the ground up with his late wife, Zambia Nkrumah, in an effort to give children a chance to engage with Black art and history. Shumake wonders in awe at where he might have been without the drum program. And some of the students whom White and Shumake shepherded reflect gratefully as they look ahead to college. By the end of the film, White will pass the leadership of the River City Drum Corp to Shumake, handing over the stewardship of the community they share.

The documentary is shot in a verite style -- there are no talking heads, and we learn who the subjects are by spending time with them, simply observing them at home and at the center. Though the movie does include footage of drum performances, it doesn't move at the clip of sticks on snares.

Science,Dog Breeding in the Neolithic Age,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/science/arctic-sled-dogs-genetics.html,"There are two broad stories about dogs and humans. One is of a deep and meaningful partnership between two species that ensures the survival of both. The other is of scavengers and camp followers that live off our garbage and feed on our corpses in the shadow of war. Both are undeniably true, in different places and different times, but vast mysteries remain about the early roots of dogs and humans, and when the first glimpses of the working partnership appeared. A 35-person team, including a who's who of ancient DNA experts, has now uncovered a vivid and genetically detailed picture of the oldest known case of selective breeding, the creation of Arctic sled dogs at least 9,500 years ago. By that time, the researchers found, sled dogs already had mutations in genes involved in oxygen use and temperature sensitivity that set them apart from other dogs and wolves.

And much of that genetic heritage survives in modern Greenland sled dogs. Other Arctic breeds, like Alaskan malamutes and Alaskan and Siberian huskies, also carry some of that heritage, although not quite as much as the Greenland dogs. Mikkel-Holger S. Sinding of the University of Copenhagen, one of the lead researchers on the project, said the genome of an ancient Siberian dog, an even older wolf, and some modern dogs provided ""the first hard evidence of early dog diversification."" He and his colleagues published their findings Thursday in Science. Elaine Ostrander, who studies dog genetics and breed differences at the National Institutes of Health, and was not involved in the research, said it was not a surprise that dogs were being selectively bred by 9,500 years ago. They were first domesticated at least 15,000 years ago. But, she said, the new research is the first ""where someone's put it all together and said, you know, this is what was going on 10,000 years ago."" Terrie M. Williams at the University of California, Santa Cruz, who studies the exercise physiology of carnivores, said researchers had tried to understand why sled dogs perform better than other breeds at running long distances, by looking at body shape and the mechanics of running. But they didn't find the major differences they were expecting. She said she was thrilled to see that the researchers had found specific genetic differences that set sled dogs apart. ""That's what's so cool here,"" she said.

Sled dogs have well-known roots in human prehistory. A 12,500-year-old tool found at one Arctic site hints at its possible use on sleds. And archaeological investigations at a well-known site on Zhokov Island in the Siberian Sea uncovered dog bones and sled technology indicating that the dogs may have been the first canines bred for a specific task. Dr. Sinding and colleagues dug deep into the DNA of one of those dogs, using a jawbone from the site dating to 9,500 years ago. They also sequenced the genomes of a Siberian wolf dating to 33,000 years ago and 10 modern Greenland sled dogs. They relied on other canine genomes archived in databases as well. They found that the Zhokov dog was closest to modern-day sled dogs, particularly to the Greenland sled dogs, which are a ""land race,"" bred for a task and sharing a look and behavior but not the sort of breed for which studbooks and records are kept. The Zhokov dog was not a direct ancestor of modern sled dogs, but it shared a common ancestor with modern sled dogs that was probably about 12,000 years old. This evidence suggested that the sled-dog type, bred for hauling loads in brutal winters, was already established 9,500 years ago. The researchers also found that sled dogs, ancient and modern, did not show interbreeding with wolves, even though other modern dog breeds do, and dog-wolf matings were known in Greenland in historic times. The results suggest hybrids may not have been much use in pulling sleds. Then the researchers started looking for genes that were different in sled dogs from both wolves and other dog breeds. They found several that made sense. One is involved in a variety of physiological functions including calcium transport and temperature sensitivity. They don't know what exactly it does in sled dogs, but they do know that several similar genes are different in mammoths, creatures of the cold, and elephants, animals of more temperate climates, suggesting some kind of adaptation to arctic life. Another gene that distinguished sled dogs from other dogs is involved in coping with low oxygen conditions. It is also found in a group of humans, sea nomads, who have been diving for thousands of years. It could, Dr. Sinding said, contribute to fitness for the extreme demands of long sled-hauling trips.

And finally, one might expect to find the Arctic dogs adapted to a different diet, than say, the dogs of the Fertile Crescent or European farmlands. They do have specific genes to cope with a high fat intake, as do humans and bears who live in the Arctic. And they do not have the same adaptations to digesting starch found in many other dog breeds. The diet adaptations were not present in the Zhokov dog, indicating that the sled dogs changed over time. Dr. Sinding cautioned that although the Greenland sled dogs and other Arctic breeds carry a major genetic contribution, particularly in terms of the important genes identified, from ancient sled dogs, they are not the same. The modern sled dogs and sled technology have their origin in Thule culture, he said, which dates to 2,000 to 3,000 years ago. And the Greenland sled dogs went through what is called a bottleneck, about 850 years ago, when the population shrunk. That was when the Inuit arrived, and they succeeded the Thule people, in Greenland. Modern Arctic breeds do have a major contribution from the sled dogs of 9,500 years ago, he said, but a gap exists between then and 3,000 years ago. In other words, if you have a malamute or a husky, do not start parading around with your pet claiming its breed goes back 9,500 years. A good part of its genes may derive from those old sled dogs, but as Dr. Mikkel pointed out, ""in principle, all dogs are equally old.""",Fossils and modern DNA show the ancient roots of Arctic sled dogs.,35030b83-45a0-5094-96db-ec761751a2f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/30/science/25TB-ARCTICDOGS1/25TB-ARCTICDOGS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=03387241f33a5fd0e7cce8d71704993f1afb4231b996d3b777fabad564fe3c45&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sled dogs on the southeastern shores of Greenland last summer.,35030b83-45a0-5094-96db-ec761751a2f9,N24News/imgs/35030b83-45a0-5094-96db-ec761751a2f9.jpg,2
Art & Design,Brazil's First Indigenous Curator: 'We're Not Afraid Anymore',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/22/arts/design/sandra-benites-brazil-museum-curator.html,"The art curator Sandra Benites at the Museum of Art of Sao Paulo Assis Chateaubriand, with ""Facoes"" by Sallisa Rosa, from her photo series ""Resistance."" These types of knives are a symbol of survival and resistance for rural Indigenous workers.



Sandra Benites, of the Guarani Nandeva people, is using art to bring new visions and voices to the museum world.

SAO PAULO, Brazil -- Sandra Benites's work is all about finding common ground. As Brazil's first Indigenous art curator, the 45-year-old educator, who grew up with the Guarani Nandeva people in the village of Porto Lindo, wants to use art to bridge the gap between Indigenous Brazilians and those from other backgrounds. She is searching for a way to show their commonality, and is looking to represent many of her country's 305 ethnic groups in ""Indigenous Stories,"" a yearlong exhibition of global indigenous art set to take place at the Museum of Art of Sao Paulo Assis Chateaubriand, known as MASP, in 2021. That shared thread, she said, will come in examples of storytelling and the profound connection all Indigenous Brazilians have to their land. ""My favorite thing is to look at the narrative -- everyone has their own way of telling a story,"" Ms. Benites said. But what unites Indigenous people, she added, ""is our vision of the world and how it relates to our territory."" As one of several curators of ""Indigenous Stories,"" she will organize an exhibition that will feature sculpture, paintings, photographs, dance, narrative song, performance and audiovisual art associated with the land.

In recent months, Brazil's Indigenous land has been at the center of a battle between the current administration of the far-right president, Jair Bolsonaro, and environmental activists, many of whom are Indigenous. As fires raged toward the end of 2019 across the Amazon in the country's north, Indigenous leaders called for an end to the decades-long deforestation of the rainforest, along with the violent attacks on leaders who were trying to protect their land. Illegal miners, loggers, farmers and ranchers became emboldened by a president who promised not to give ""one more centimeter"" of land to Indigenous people so that it could be used, instead, for activities he deemed more lucrative for the country's economy.

Data from Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, known as INPE, proved that the environmentalists' suspicions were not unfounded. The agency's Deter database showed that annual deforestation in the country's Amazon rose 85 percent in 2019 compared with the previous year. In November, figures from the space agency's Prodes project, which monitors clear-cut deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, showed deforestation in 2019 was at its highest in over a decade, and up 30 percent from 2018. Now, Mr. Bolsonaro has moved to legalize activities like commercial mining and hydroelectric energy production projects on Indigenous land, a key pledge of his 2018 election campaign. He announced in early February his intention to present a bill to Congress. For Ms. Benites, the struggle to protect Indigenous land has been a flash point since Brazil was colonized by the Portuguese, giving groups centuries of practice to learn how to handle the current situation. ""This has always happened, but it used to be more veiled,"" she said. ""Now it's been completely unmasked."" She added, ""We've been up against it basically since 1500, meaning we're not afraid anymore. I remember all of my relatives saying, 'The more we're attacked, the more we're encouraged.' We're aware of our own wisdom and know how we have to fight back, and that's by creating a dialogue with others.""

These days, Indigenous Brazilians are facing another immense challenge, as the coronavirus has made its way into their communities. As of Monday, the Special Secretariat for Indigenous Health confirmed 402 cases and 23 deaths from the virus. Memories of Europeans who brought smallpox and measles to Indigenous communities in the 1560s were reawakened when a judge issued an order on April 17 banning evangelical missionaries from the Amazon's Javari Valley, where the world's largest concentration of isolated tribes live. But there are still concerns that illegal miners and loggers, who continue to work in the region, will help spread the virus there. Ms. Benites, who lives in Rio de Janeiro, had been traveling to Sao Paulo several times a month to prepare for ""Indigenous Stories,"" looking at art that plays the role of conversation starter, pushing people from all backgrounds to have more frank discussions about history, Indigenous rights and culture, and the protection of the environment.

While MASP shut its doors on March 17 and Ms. Benites is working from home, ""Indigenous Stories"" is still scheduled to take place next year. She hasn't yet made specific selections for the exhibition, but she said she wanted to include artists who paint about cosmology and its important symbolism in Indigenous cultures and origin stories; artists who make photos about their and other people's connection to nature; and who sing as a form of resistance. Ms. Benites is particularly concerned about the rights of Indigenous women in Brazil, who she said still haven't had the chance to delve into issues like autonomy and better working conditions, because ""Indigenous women are still fighting for survival, for the Indigenous way of life."" She looks to her grandmother, a Guarani Nandeva leader and midwife, as an inspiration. ""She said that when I grew up, I had to learn to embrace the world because the world won't embrace you,"" Ms. Benites explained. The inclusion of female artists in the exhibition will give them the opportunity ""to be the protagonists of their own voices,"" Ms. Benites said. She hopes to include women from various ethnicities and disciplines, like a Guajajara performance artist, a Karaja photographer, a Huni Kuin painter, and Guarani and Maxacali audiovisual artists. The work of the artist Sallisa Rosa speaks to the themes Ms. Benites wants ""Indigenous Stories"" to represent. Ms. Rosa uses photography and video to explore contemporary identity in Brazil through stories of violence, forced migration and the erasure of memories, rituals and ancestry.

Ms. Rosa's ""Facoes,"" from a photo series called ""Resistance,"" features knives as a symbol of survival and resistance for rural workers. The piece was part of the 2019 exhibition, ""Historias feministas: artistas depois de 2000"" (""Feminist stories: artists after the year 2000""), and is now a part of MASP's permanent exhibition. Before she was asked to join the museum as an adjunct curator of Brazilian art last year, Ms. Benites was a teacher in Indigenous schools, which offer the same subjects found in all public schools but add classes on Indigenous culture and language. She noticed, however, that the history and geography books they were given weren't adequate. ""We didn't see ourselves in it,"" Ms. Benites said, explaining her decision to pursue her master's degree in intercultural Indigenous education so that she could broach these subjects with decision makers.

She had little experience working with artists. Her first step was in 2017, when she was one of four curators of an exhibition at the Art Museum of Rio called ""Dja Guata Pora: Indigenous Rio de Janeiro."" Indigenous art presented in museums is often researched and selected by non-Indigenous curators and put on display based solely on their vision, Ms. Benites said. With ""Dja Guata Pora,"" she made sure the planning included Indigenous people and the artists themselves. That same year, she was invited by the museum to present a seminar that would introduce museum-goers to the 2021 Indigenous art exhibition as it began its preparations for the project, which led to the request that she come on permanently. ""It's a turning point in the history of Brazilian museums and institutions,"" Adriano Pedrosa, MASP's artistic director, said of her hiring. ""We see many institutions now realizing the necessity of bringing Indigenous art and culture to art museums, beyond the ethnographic museums.

""It's often we're looking at something as foreigners, as outsiders,"" he added, ""so it's fantastic to have someone who sees things as an insider."" As with ""Dja Guata Pora,"" Ms. Benites said she would make sure that decisions on how to present the pieces in the show will be made by everyone working on the project, including the artists. For Indigenous people, she said, art is not about the work, but the artist who creates it. There's no equivalent, for instance, to the word ""art"" in the Guarani language; the closest translation is tembiapo, or ""related to someone's abilities,"" she explained. ""The artist is fundamental for this work to exist. That's why we first look to the artist and not the art itself."" Most Guarani boys, for example, learn to carve animals out of wood from a young age, but when you look at a carving, you know who created it, because the artists bring their own story and hard work to their pieces. ""Art makes so many things possible,"" she said. ""These narratives, or songs, or dances, or paintings, they all help you understand that other person behind it."" At the same time, she's also co-curating ""Sawe,"" an exhibition about Indigenous political leaders, set to open at the end of this year at Sao Paulo's SESC Ipiranga cultural center. She hopes that others will learn from the art she chooses, particularly about perspective and the importance of including the voices of women artists in the conversation.","Sandra Benites, of the Guaraní Ñandeva people, is using art to bring new visions and voices to the museum world.",b4498067-9250-5a15-ad14-13a913b0ca61,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/arts/31benites1/31benites1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b73e8079100967c764913bd287590f176188eadf392787e95392cca7e69c0104&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The art curator Sandra Benites at the Museum of Art of São Paulo Assis Chateaubriand, with ""Facões"" by Sallisa Rosa, from her photo series ""Resistance.""

Food,"Pasta, Herbs and Plenty of Melting Mozzarella",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/dining/pasta-herbs-and-plenty-of-melting-mozzarella.html,"This one is different. It skips the tomatoes but keeps the basil, blending the fragrant leaves -- along with fresh mint, Parmesan, garlic and a little chile -- into a vibrant, pestolike sauce. At the very end, pine nuts are added to the bowl for crunch, and more fresh herbs are tossed in for brightness. It's both light and rich, with a garlicky bite. It's also extremely fast and easy to make.

One thing to consider is the type of mozzarella you use. The softer and milkier your cheese is to begin with, the more it will melt and run, while firm varieties, usually those that have been salted, will retain more of their shape.

Both types work well here. Firm mozzarella will give you pockets of supple but not-quite-melted cheese. Ultra-creamy burrata collapses into a luscious sauce, mixing with the pesto and turning it all a speckled light green. Buffalo mozzarella usually splits the difference; its more tender core melts while its outer skin tends to stay intact. In any case, it's important to let the cheese come to room temperature before adding it to the bowl so it doesn't cool the pasta.","This warm-weather dish is light, bright and garlicky — and easy to make.",1c052cf2-8d58-5274-9a67-0e6615e4d3a5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/dining/19APPE1/19APPE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1d5a90ac5e1ff95d28c2b7573adc2719d251315771d598803ed331a62377d8bb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,This light herb and pasta dish uses the heat from freshly boiled pasta to melt the mozzarella without requiring an oven.,1c052cf2-8d58-5274-9a67-0e6615e4d3a5,N24News/imgs/1c052cf2-8d58-5274-9a67-0e6615e4d3a5.jpg,17
Health,A Plan to Use Survivors' Blood for Ebola Treatment in Africa,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/health/use-of-ebola-survivors-blood-as-possible-treatment-gains-support.html,"With no proven drugs to treat Ebola and experimental ones in short supply, the health authorities are planning to turn instead to a treatment that is walking around in the outbreak zone in West Africa.

That would be the blood of people who have been sickened by the Ebola virus but have since recovered. Their blood should contain antibodies that might help other patients fight off the infection.

The World Health Organization is making it a priority to try such convalescent blood or plasma, as it is called, and is talking with the affected countries about how to do it.

This week, the organization issued guidance on how to collect the blood and administer transfusions.

""The concept that this treatment could be efficacious is biologically plausible, as convalescent plasma has been used successfully for the treatment of a variety of infectious agents,"" the W.H.O. guidance document says.

Plausibility, however, is not proof that such treatments would work for Ebola and some virologists doubt it will. The results of studies in monkeys were discouraging, they note.

There will also be logistical problems carrying this out in West Africa, where blood banks are not well developed. One challenge will be to make sure that the donated blood, even if it helps patients recover from Ebola, does not give them H.I.V. or hepatitis.

""Major questions need to be answered about the safety and efficacy of convalescent therapies, and the feasibility of implementation in countries with shattered health systems and an acute shortage of medical staff,"" the W.H.O. said in a separate statement released a week ago.

Still, with the epidemic spiraling out of control, there is a sense that some treatment needs to be offered, even if only to give sick people hope and a reason to go to medical centers, where they can be stopped from spreading the disease to others. And there are really no other good options.","The World Health Organization has issued guidance in West Africa on collecting convalescent blood or plasma for transfusion, but there are obstacles.",272984cb-c8bf-5f52-99a9-e08a19a2974c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/04/us/JP-SERUM/JP-SERUM-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=4220fe6ad11581df68b856b78586b32608e942a3a4bc3666c01cd383a749e472&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Health officials hope to recruit survivors, like Julius Prout of Liberia, to give blood to help others.",272984cb-c8bf-5f52-99a9-e08a19a2974c,N24News/imgs/272984cb-c8bf-5f52-99a9-e08a19a2974c.jpg,1

Education,Studying Engineering Before They Can Spell It,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/14/education/14engineering.html,"GLEN ROCK, N.J.  In a class full of aspiring engineers, the big bad wolf had to do more than just huff and puff to blow down the three little pigs' house. To start, he needed to get past a voice-activated security gate, find a hidden door and negotiate a few other traps in a house that a pair of kindergartners here imagined for the pigs  and then pieced together from index cards, paper cups, wood sticks and pipe cleaners. ""Excellent engineering,"" their teacher, Mary Morrow, told them one day early this month. All 300 students at Clara E. Coleman Elementary School are learning the A B C's of engineering this year, even those who cannot yet spell e-n-g-i-n-e-e-r-i-n-g. The high-performing Glen Rock school district, about 22 miles northwest of Manhattan, now teaches 10 to 15 hours of engineering each year to every student in kindergarten through fifth grade, as part of a $100,000 redesign of the science curriculum. Spurred by growing concerns that American students lack the skills to compete in a global economy, school districts nationwide are packing engineering lessons into already crowded schedules for even the youngest students, giving priority to a subject that was once left to after-school robotics clubs and summer camps, or else waited until college.

Supporters say that engineering reinforces math and science skills, promotes critical thinking and creativity, and teaches students not to be afraid of taking intellectual risks. ""We still hear all the time that little kids can't engineer,"" said Christine Cunningham, director of Engineering is Elementary, a program developed at the Museum of Science in Boston that offers ready-made lessons, for about $350 each, on 20 topics, and is now used in all 50 states, in more than 3,000 schools. ""We say they're born engineers  they naturally want to solve problems  and we tend to educate it out of them."" The Obama administration's Race to the Top competition, which will distribute $4.35 billion in education stimulus money to states, favors so-called STEM programs, which stands for science, technology, engineering and math. At the same time, Congress is considering legislation, endorsed by more than 100 businesses and organizations like I.B.M. and Lockheed Martin, to promote engineering education from kindergarten through 12th grade.

In Manassas, Va., which has a thriving biotech industry, the local school district has spent $300,000 on a children's engineering program since 2008, equipping its six elementary schools with tool kits for projects like making musical instruments from odds and ends, building bridges with uncooked spaghetti and launching hot-air balloons made from trash bags and cups. At the new Midway Elementary School of Science and Engineering in Anderson, S.C., kindergartners celebrated Groundhog Day by stringing together a pulley system to lift a paper groundhog off the floor. But as these lessons have spread, some parents, teachers and engineers question how much children are really absorbing, and if schools should be expending limited resources on the subject. Engineering is not a requirement in most states. (New Jersey is an exception: the state standards mandate some exposure to engineering by second grade.) ""Just giving kids an engineering problem to solve doesn't mean it will lead to learning,"" said Janine Remillard, an associate education professor at the University of Pennsylvania who is not opposed, but believes that good teaching is essential to making any curriculum work well. She pointed out that schools have long offered project-based learning, without calling it engineering, like building Lego robots or designing a cushion for an egg drop. First graders at Coleman Elementary School in Glen Rock, N.J. The district teaches 10 to 15 hours a year of engineering from kindergarten through fifth grade. ""Ideally, you want them to come away with knowledge that goes beyond that problem,"" Professor Remillard said. ""They could just go through the motions and end up with a robot that can do a particular thing, but the next problem they face will be a new problem. This is where good teaching comes in.""

William E. Kelly, a spokesman for the American Society for Engineering Education and former dean of the engineering school at Catholic University in Washington, cautioned that engineering lessons for youngsters should be kept in perspective. ""You're not really learning what I would call engineering fundamentals,"" he said of such programs. ""You're really learning about engineering."" Here in Glen Rock, where students have long excelled at math and science, administrators and teachers decided to incorporate engineering into the elementary grades to connect classroom learning to real life, as well as to instill social skills like collaboration and cooperation that are valued in the work force, said Kathleen Regan, the curriculum director. ""At first, everybody was like: 'Engineering? Kindergarten?' "" recalled Dr. Regan, noting that one school board member joked that she must be married to an engineer (no; a lawyer). But now, Dr. Regan said, the engineering lessons have become so popular that children are talking about their projects at the dinner table, and some of their parents have started researching engineering colleges. Ms. Morrow and Jennifer Burke, who also teach classes for the gifted and talented, developed the engineering lessons and run them in all four elementary schools.

They plan multiday projects, often built around classic and popular stories like the Three Little Pigs, and take students step by step through the engineering process: design, build, test, evaluate. ""They have to have the thinking skills of an engineer to keep up with all the innovation that's constantly coming into their world,"" Ms. Morrow said. First graders were recently challenged with helping a farmer keep rabbits out of his garden. In teams of four, they brainstormed about building fences with difficult-to-scale ladders instead of doors and setting out food decoys for the rabbits. They drew up blueprints and then brought them to life with plastic plates, paper cups, straws and foam paper. Then they planned to test their ideas with pop-up plastic rabbits. If the fences were breached, they would be asked to improve the design. ""It gets your brain going,"" said Elizabeth Crowley, 7, who wants to be an engineer when she grows up. ""And I actually learn something when I'm doing a project  like you can work together to do something you couldn't do before."" In the kindergarten class that was designing homes  none out of hay, wood or brick  for the three pigs, Ms. Morrow started the lesson by asking the 20 children sitting cross-legged on the carpet if they knew what engineers do. ""Well,"" Ms. Morrow allowed, ""they could write a poem about something they build.""","To compete in a global economy, some school districts are offering engineering lessons to students in kindergarten.",8fc8a8cb-80fe-583a-8f06-3474d1e4c60b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/14/nyregion/14engineeringcnd_337-395/14engineeringcnd_337-395-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=12c5b330a28162eac105f02a2059dc066e99421960535e0842af546ae5fd1980&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"In a Glen Rock, N.J., kindergarten, testing a wolf-proof house.",8fc8a8cb-80fe-583a-8f06-3474d1e4c60b,N24News/imgs/8fc8a8cb-80fe-583a-8f06-3474d1e4c60b.jpg,22
Technology,Another 'Unfounded' Study on Origins of Virus Spreads Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/technology/another-unfounded-study-on-origins-of-virus-spreads-online.html,"An overwhelming body of evidence continues to affirm that the coronavirus almost certainly made its hop into humans from an animal source -- as many, many other deadly viruses are known to do. But since the early days of the pandemic, experts have had to fight to combat misinformed rumors that the coronavirus emerged from a lab as part of a sinister scientific project. Last week, yet another piece of unfounded and misleading prose entered the fray: a study, posted online but not published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, contending that the virus is artificial and an ""unrestricted bio-weapon"" released by Chinese researchers.

Though scientists immediately condemned the study as disreputable and dangerous, it rapidly commanded a storm of social media attention, garnering more than 14,000 likes on Twitter and more than 12,000 retweets and quote-tweets within days of its posting. Shared on Facebook, Twitter and Reddit, it reached millions of users, and was covered in at least a dozen articles written in several languages. The paper's findings, however, have no basis in science. ""It's ridiculous and unfounded,"" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University who criticized the study on Twitter the day it was released. ""It's masquerading as scientific evidence, but really it's just a dumpster fire.""

The publication is the second in a series from a team led by Li-Meng Yan, a Chinese scientist who released an initial paper on Sept. 14, also not peer-reviewed, asserting that the coronavirus was synthetic. Dr. Yan's background is a little murky. She left her position as a postdoctoral research fellow at Hong Kong University for undisclosed reasons some time ago, according to a July statement from the institution, and fled to the United States. Both papers list Dr. Yan and her co-authors as affiliated with the Rule of Law Society, a nonprofit whose founders include Steve Bannon, a former White House chief strategist, who has since been charged in an unrelated case of fraud.

""That alone should give people pause,"" Dr. Rasmussen said of the team's connection to Mr. Bannon's nonprofit. Dr. Yan and her colleagues did not respond to a request for comment. Their original paper -- known as ""the Yan report"" -- was also seized upon by thousands online and reported on in The New York Post, even though experts rapidly debunked its findings. Researchers called it unscientific and said it ignored the wealth of data pointing to the virus's natural origins. Close relatives of the new coronavirus exist in bats. The virus may have moved directly into people from bats, or first jumped into another animal, such as a pangolin, before transitioning into humans. Both scenarios have played out before with other pathogens. ""We have a very good picture of how a virus of this kind could circulate and spill over into human beings,"" said Brandon Ogbunu, a disease ecologist at Yale University. It may take quite some time to pinpoint exactly which animals harbored the virus along this chain of transmission, if scientists ever do at all -- inevitably leaving some parts of the virus's origin story ambiguous. Like many other conspiracy theories, the lab-made hypothesis ""exploits the open questions in an ongoing investigation,"" Dr. Ogbunu said. But there is no evidence so far to support a synthetic source for the virus. Dr. Yan's Twitter account was suspended in September 2020 for pushing coronavirus disinformation. She shared the ""second Yan report"" from a second Twitter account, which has gained more than 34,000 followers. Together, the papers written by Dr. Yan and her colleagues lay out what they identified as abnormalities in the genome sequence of the coronavirus. They suggested that those unusual features indicated that the virus's genome had been purposefully spliced together and modified, using the genetic material from other viruses -- a sort of Frankenstein's monster pathogen, Dr. Yan told Fox News in September. The cousins of the coronavirus that had been identified in bats, they said, were also fake, human-made constructions, thus supposedly quashing the natural origin hypothesis.

The authors also contended that the coronavirus's genome had been manipulated by scientists to enhance the virus's ability to infect human cells and cause disease. But outside experts have found no validity in either Yan report. The first was ""full of contradictory statements and unsound interpretations"" of genetic data from viruses, said Kishana Taylor, a virologist at Carnegie Mellon University. And the second Yan report ""was even more unhinged than the first,"" said Gigi Kwik Gronvall, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security and an author of a response debunking the original Yan report. The supposedly strange features found in the genomes of the coronavirus and its natural relatives aren't actually red flags at all, Dr. Ogbunu said. Viruses frequently move between animal hosts, changing their genetic material along the way -- sometimes even swapping hunks of their genomes with other viruses. And many of the purported abnormalities in the coronavirus are found in other virus genomes. The notion that the coronavirus was ""designed"" to be dangerous is also ""just nonsense,"" Dr. Ogbunu said. Scientists don't know enough about viruses to predict which mutations would increase their lethality, let alone engineer these changes into new pathogens in the lab. Building the coronavirus from such a mishmash of genetic templates, as described by Dr. Yan and her colleagues, would also raise herculean logistical hurdles for even the most dogged scientists. Part of this process would require researchers to laboriously tinker with thousands of individual letters in the alphabet soup that is a virus's genome -- an absurdly inefficient scientific strategy, Dr. Rasmussen said. ""Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,"" Dr. Rasmussen said. ""And this is not that.""","The publication is the second in a series, from a team led by a Chinese scientist, that has been widely discredited by experts.",05f2432e-d5c2-5491-93dc-7e08fccfb699,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/13/business/13distortions-china/merlin_176726436_7220315e-3270-4d30-ac42-988fcc33a32a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=131cb0b19da1d72982b5bbda344c0b4a2770dd30ed6a0e0d2788060dccb38cd3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An electron microscope image of a Novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 particle isolated from a patient.,05f2432e-d5c2-5491-93dc-7e08fccfb699,N24News/imgs/05f2432e-d5c2-5491-93dc-7e08fccfb699.jpg,20
Sports,La Liga Chief Claims Saudi Arabia Is Using Sports to 'Whitewash' Reputation,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/sports/soccer/spain-soccer-saudi-arabia.html,"LONDON -- In European soccer's relentless search for growth and new revenues, Spain's La Liga has been among the most aggressive of the continent's top leagues. Under a plan hatched and pressed by its chief executive, Javier Tebas, La Liga has planted its flag across the globe, opening offices in far-flung cities -- not just obvious markets like New York and China, but also in Belgium and Singapore and South Africa, among others -- in a bid to scoop up new fans and television and sponsorship dollars. Tebas has even gone to court in the United States in an effort to hold a league game outside Spain. But there is one red line Tebas said that he is unwilling to cross: La Liga and its teams should not, he argued, be playing matches in Saudi Arabia. To Tebas, the kingdom, despite its high-profile campaign to rebrand itself as a modern and tolerant society led by a youthful crown prince, should not be permitted to use international sporting events to mask its record of human rights abuses.

So he could only watch with impotent fury earlier this month when the country's four biggest teams -- Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atletico Madrid and Valencia -- decamped to Saudi Arabia for the annual Spanish Super Cup. There was nothing Tebas could do to stop the games; the league plays no role in them. Instead, the Spanish soccer federation runs the competition, and it had struck a three-year deal with Saudi authorities worth 120 million euros ($133 million) to turn what was once a one-game event into a four-team tournament, and to crown its champion in the kingdom. The federation, he said, had simply followed the trail of new money, and had brought the teams along for the ride.

""The bottom line is football has become a business and as a business it looks for income,"" Barcelona's since-fired coach, Ernesto Valverde, had said upon arriving in Riyadh for the semifinals. ""That's the reason we are all here."" To Tebas, however, Spain's soccer federation had allowed itself and La Liga's biggest teams to be used in what he labeled reputation laundering. The games, he noted, were played barely a year after operatives from Saudi Arabia flew to Istanbul and, according to Turkish officials, brutally murdered a dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, inside the Saudi embassy there.

""We should not forget what happened,"" Tebas said. ""This is very serious,'' he added. ""Money is not the only thing that matters."" Few Spanish fans traveled to the games, and the Spanish broadcaster that routinely had broadcast the game in previous years declined to do so this year, citing concerns over human rights in Saudi Arabia. The president of Spain's soccer federation, Luis Rubiales, defended the decision to play the games in the country, describing the tournament ""as a tool of social change"" because men and women would be permitted to sit side by side, in a country where women's rights are restricted. Saudi Arabia first allowed women to enter soccer stadiums in 2018, but in the past men and women were segregated at matches. And the soccer matches had ample precedents. In recent years, Saudi riches have lured in not only other soccer games, but title fights in professional boxing, auto races, tennis matches and even W.W.E. events. There is even a multiyear arrangement with snooker's governing body.

A series of independent studies have concluded that a Saudi-based channel named BeoutQ has been stealing and airing lucrative sports properties, including La Liga games, whose rights are owned by Qatar-based beIN Sports. As Saudi Arabia continues to deny that it is hosting the network, despite mounting evidence to the contrary, organizations like La Liga and England's Premier League and even soccer governing bodies like UEFA and FIFA have found tackling the issue almost impossible, mainly because lawyers in Saudi Arabia have refused to take on them on as clients. ""They were pirating the signal and there were institutions linked to the actual government,"" Tebas said of Saudi Arabian broadcasters. ""They are still favoring actions that go against our property. And the wealth we are generating, we cannot have that wealth going there."" Complicating matters further for Tebas are business moves in Spain's second division, which he also oversees as La Liga's chief executive, by Turki al-Sheikh, a key confidant of the de facto Saudi leader, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and a member of the government. Sheikh last summer acquired the Andalusian team Almeria and since then has bankrolled a program to overhaul the team in a bid to win promotion to the first division, where it could compete against the likes of Real Madrid, Barcelona and Spain's other biggest clubs.

Describing Sheikh as a man of ""great financial clout,"" Tebas said the league would not allow Almeria to buy its way to success. Allowing it to do so would not only breach cost control regulations in Spain, Tebas said, but also leave him open to criticism personally, given how outspoken he has been about spending by Gulf-backed teams in the past. Tebas has for years complained that Manchester City, owned by a member of the Abu Dhabi royal family, and Qatar-owned Paris St.-Germain have had an inflationary impact on European soccer's financial ecosystem.","The pointed criticism from Javier Tebas came days after four Spanish teams played a tournament in the kingdom, which has been accused of allowing the piracy of La Liga's broadcast rights.",f1e7dba9-9338-5ba8-a02c-c8e963813e5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20spainsoccertop/20spainsoccertop-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8646f3be65c821c7ff33d3afa029a61d12049101d8e3f5c919e32e151af3f43a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A banner with portraits of Saudi Arabia's King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman was displayed during a match between Real Madrid and Valencia.,f1e7dba9-9338-5ba8-a02c-c8e963813e5a,N24News/imgs/f1e7dba9-9338-5ba8-a02c-c8e963813e5a.jpg,9
Health,Think the E.R. Is Expensive? Look at How Much It Costs to Get There,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/05/health/think-the-er-was-expensive-look-at-the-ambulance-bill.html,"Think the E.R. Is Expensive? Look at How Much It Costs to Get There

Kira Milas has no idea who called 911, summoning an ambulance filled with emergency medical technicians. Ms. Milas, 23, was working as a swim instructor for the summer and had swum into the side of the pool, breaking three teeth. Shaken, she accepted the ambulance ride to Scripps Memorial Hospital in La Jolla, Calif. The paramedics applied a neck brace as a precaution. A week later she received a bill for the 15-minute trip: $1,772.42. Though her employer's workers' compensation will cover the bill, she still was stunned at the charge. ""We only drove nine miles and it was a non-life-threatening injury,"" she said in a phone interview. ""I needed absolutely no emergency treatment."" Thirty years ago ambulance rides were generally provided free of charge, underwritten by taxpayers as a municipal service or provided by volunteers. Today, like the rest of the health care system in the United States, most ambulance services operate as businesses and contribute to America's escalating medical bills. Often, they are a high-cost prequel to expensive emergency room visits.

Although ambulances are often requested by a bystander or summoned by 911 dispatchers, they are almost always billed to the patient involved. And the charges, as well as insurance coverage, range widely, from zero to tens of thousands of dollars. ""There are a significant numbers of patients who have no coverage for this, and the number of self-pay patients has climbed"" since the recession, said Jay Fitch, president of Fitch and Associates, the largest emergency medical services consulting firm in the United States.

What is more, since ambulances companies typically collect only 30 to 40 percent of the amount they bill, they often try to charge more for patients with insurance and those who can pay, Mr. Fitch said. Part of the inconsistency in pricing stems from the fact that ambulance services are variously run by fire departments, hospitals, private companies and volunteer groups. Some services are included in insurance networks, others not.

""There's a saying that if you've seen one emergency medical system, you've seen one emergency medical system -- no two are alike,"" said Dr. Robert E. O'Connor, a vice president of the American College of Emergency Medicine and chairman of the department at the University of Virginia. Charges and payments, he said, ""are all over the place."" Fire departments, which don't charge for driving to fire alarms, do charge for ambulance runs. In such a fragmented system, it is hard to know how much high-priced ambulance transport contributes nationally to America's $2.7 trillion health care bill. And total out-of-pocket expenditures by individuals are hard to tally. But Medicare, the insurance program for the elderly, does tabulate its numbers and has become alarmed at its fast-rising expenditures for ambulance rides: nearly $6 billion a year, up from just $2 billion in 2002. That is true even though Medicare's fixed payments for ambulance rides -- ranging from $289 to $481 in 2011 -- are far lower than commercial rates. Ambulance companies complain that Medicare rates do not meet the costs of running what are essentially mobile emergency rooms staffed by highly trained professionals. In a recent study, the federal Health and Human Services Department's Office of the Inspector General noted that the Medicare ambulance services were ""vulnerable to abuse and fraud,"" in part because there were lax standards on when an ambulance was needed and how the trip should be billed. The number of transports paid for by Medicare increased 69 percent between 2002 and 2011, while the number of Medicare patients increased only 7 percent during that period. In the last year, two ambulance companies have pleaded guilty or settled claims for overbilling Medicare. The Affordable Care Act requires policies to include some coverage for emergency care as an essential benefit, including ambulance transport. But the ambulance ride and the care are billed separately. Many Silver plans -- a lower-tier plan -- require patients to pay an initial copay of $250 for the emergency room and $250 more for the transport, for example.

That determination can be highly subjective. Some will grant coverage if the destination was an emergency room, regardless of the patient's status, but others may require admittance to the hospital as evidence that the condition was serious. ""Insurers will generally cover if you had good reason to believe there was a serious threat to your life or health,"" said Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America's Health Insurance Plans, an industry group. But when an ambulance arrives, sick patients or injured people like Ms. Milas, often feel they have little choice but to get in, unaware of the potential price tag. If an emergency call comes to 911, dispatchers decide which ambulance to send, depending on proximity. Most ambulance companies bill according to the level of skill of the team on board, rather than the medical needs of the patients they collect. A team capable of administering Advanced Cardiac Life Support costs more than one with only basic first aid training. Distance rarely counts for much, although a small mileage charge is added to the fee. Some companies even charge hundreds of dollars extra if a friend or relative rides along with an injured patients. This fall, Joanne Freedman went to an urgent care center near her home in New York City with a bad headache and a fever. The doctor recommended she go to a hospital for further evaluation and offered to call an ambulance. ""I could have walked, but I'm feeling crummy so I think, ' OK, why not?' "" she recalled. The two-block ride was billed at $900, and she has not yet learned what her insurer may ask her to pay. ""It was crazy,"" she said. ""All they did was put a paper mask on me so I wouldn't infect anyone else."" Ms. Freedman had a spinal tap at the hospital and was admitted for a few days. Nonetheless, she said, for $900, the next time, no matter how ill she will walk up the hill or take a cab.","Ambulances, once free, are now generally run as businesses that contribute to America's escalating medical bills.",a0389036-bedf-5f42-8371-b091b3b93eae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/04/us/AMBULANCE-2/AMBULANCE-2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=399&w=600&s=a18bd63084525db7c84ba862fa8f37a38afae138cf1161af6ac41b60f3e9ee15&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"When an ambulance arrives, sick patients or injured people often feel they have little choice but to get in, unaware of the potential price tag.",a0389036-bedf-5f42-8371-b091b3b93eae,N24News/imgs/a0389036-bedf-5f42-8371-b091b3b93eae.jpg,1

Fashion & Style,"For Some Men, Mark Zuckerberg Is a Lifestyle Guru",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/fashion/mens-style/mark-zuckerberg-lifestyle-guru.html,"Anyone who has ever taken to social media to announce a self-improvement project knows that your ""friends"" cannot be relied upon to hold you accountable. Almost as soon as you proclaim your intention to learn French or cut out carbs, the world moves on, leaving you with only your empty promises and scone crumbs on your shirt. It's not so easy to slack if you're Mark Zuckerberg. Each year, Mr. Zuckerberg, the Facebook co-founder and C.E.O., who is now 31, has made public pledges to improve himself. His efforts have been closely tracked by the press and by users of his globe-spanning social network who seem never to forget his promises despite the Internet's ability to reset itself every morning in the manner of ""Groundhog Day."" In 2009, Mr. Zuckerberg decided to wear a tie every day. In 2010, he set himself the task of learning to speak Mandarin. In 2011, he vowed that when he ate meat, it would be only from animals he had slaughtered himself, a pledge seemingly confirmed by a leaked photo of him grinning while holding a chicken by its feet. In 2013 he aimed to meet someone new every day. In 2014, he promised to write a daily handwritten (or emailed) thank-you note. Last year, he started his own book club, reading a new title every two weeks.

This year is no different. Even though Mr. Zuckerberg probably has his hands full with his company and a new baby, he has said he will run 365 miles over the course of the year and build an artificial intelligence butler for his home. Mr. Zuckerberg's efforts have made him the object of fascination and emulation among a subset of millennials in and around the tech industry. More than seeing Mr. Zuckerberg as merely an avatar of tech success and unfathomable wealth, they consider him a role model. ""I run three experiments each year inspired by Zuckerberg,"" said Dave Fontenot, 22, a San Francisco resident who used to be an agent for engineers, but who said he is currently ""focusing on myself."" This year, Mr. Fontenot aims to improve his posture, meditate and spend more time alone. He also trained himself to send thank-you notes, either handwritten or as voice recordings via text, inspired by Mr. Zuckerberg. ""For a period of time, I wasn't thanking people at all, but then, for one of the most powerful person in the world to do it, I was like, wow,"" Mr. Fontenot said. In 2012, Mr. Fontenot was invited to Facebook's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., after winning a hackathon at the University of Michigan. There, he had a chance to see Mr. Zuckerberg up close.

Mr. Fontenot remembered a moment when Mr. Zuckerberg spotted someone juggling and expressed a desire to try it. ""In 20 minutes, he kind of learned it,"" Mr. Fontenot said. Lukas Biewald, a co-founder and the C.E.O. of CrowdFlower, a crowdsourcing company in San Francisco, sees Mr. Zuckerberg's efforts at self-betterment, maybe even including juggling, as emblematic of the tech industry as a whole. ""I think taking on self-improvement projects outside of work is part of the zeitgeist of Silicon Valley,"" said Mr. Biewald, 34. ""People expect you to have things that you care about outside of work.""

For John Mills, 33, a woodworker and a co-founder of Zenput, a mobile work-tracking company, that means internal and external initiatives. ""I've actually started meditating and yoga,"" he said. ""I started to get involved in nonprofit work, started to donate more of my time and money and resources to nonprofits I believe in."" Mr. Zuckerberg's recent philanthropic efforts are particularly inspiring to Mr. Mills. ""To see him become a philanthropist on the largest scale possible is amazing to see,"" Mr. Mills said. ""He keeps reinventing himself and being a better human being."" To Erik Zuuring, 26, a designer and developer in Montreal, Mr. Zuckerberg's self-improvement offers permission to develop mastery outside of technology. ""I see these self-improvement things from Zuckerberg as a way to say, 'You don't have to always rely on computers, you can do things without distractions,'"" Mr. Zuuring said.

""I became a vegetarian and found ways to exercise, take an hour to play guitar or read a book,"" he said. ""I think that's what Zuckerberg is trying to get people to do, too. It's inspiring, but in some sense it's weird, coming from Facebook."" ""I've looked at the list of many things he's done and followed many of the same paths,"" said Ben Tauber, the 32-year-old founder of Velocity, a platform that connects people to personal and professional coaches. ""I have a personal meditation practice, paid attention to my food, killed my own chickens."" ""One of the things that I've really appreciated is the transformation I've seen Mark go through from the outside, how he communicated what his values were when he was 24, 26, to what his values are now,"" Mr. Tauber said. That transformation didn't always seem inevitable. The early public perception of the once-20-something C.E.O. was as an emotionless carbon-based offshoot of the Internet itself. Jesse Eisenberg's affectless rendering of Mr. Zuckerberg in the movie ""The Social Network"" may have brought the image to a wider audience, but the impression had been formed years earlier, by awkward public appearances like a Q. and A. at the 2008 South by Southwest Interactive Festival that went from stiff to testy in no time. The few rote-seeming interviews Mr. Zuckerberg has given over the years have only served to confirm the assumption that he is more machine than man. That may be why his annual announcements sometimes have the feel of software upgrades. (Mr. Zuckerberg, through a spokeswoman, declined to speak about his yearly challenges, citing time constraints.)

""Somewhere along the line he's changed into the aspirational model in chief,"" said Tom Junod, Esquire's writer at large, who profiled the press-shy Mr. Zuckerberg for the magazine using only publicly available quotes. ""I think it's when he started doing these self-improvement projects."" In his elusive subject, Mr. Junod discovered ""the most interesting boring person in the world or the most boring interesting one."" Not everyone in the tech field is a Zuckerberg acolyte. Max Nanis, a 25-year-old computational biologist (""You'd call me a 'brogrammer,'"" he said) from the La Jolla section of San Diego, compared some of Mr. Zuckerberg's public pronouncements and peekaboo social media presence to those of the Kardashians. ""The way he acts is no different than a 20-year-old model on Instagram,"" Mr. Nanis said. ""He knows he has influence. That's how I read a lot of those messages."" (Perhaps, but unlike any of those models, Mr. Zuckerberg acquired Instagram for $1 billion in 2012.) ""I'm sure people aspire to be Mark Zuckerberg when they grow up,"" Mr. Nanis said. But, he said, ""People that need role models for very rudimentary behaviors for taking care of themselves probably have other problems to deal with."" ""No single person can rewrite a social norm, but if one influential person lets it be known that even at the pinnacle of success one ought to reassess life, that's a good influence,"" said Steven Pinker, 61, the Harvard professor whose ""The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"" was one of Mr. Zuckerberg's book club picks.","Each year the Facebook chief executive announces a self-improvement project. And now a number of ""brogrammers"" follow his lead.",1eed6924-8af6-5ce5-8597-ee213f3dfed5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/28/fashion/28ZUCKERBERG/28ZUCKERBERG-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=891f22abe560a90873b5a7be42af6e4cd43270e6b779e7118a2c815f9fb3418e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mark Zuckerberg, the C.E.O. of Facebook, makes a self-improvement pledge each year, inspiring others to do so, too.",1eed6924-8af6-5ce5-8597-ee213f3dfed5,N24News/imgs/1eed6924-8af6-5ce5-8597-ee213f3dfed5.jpg,19
Opinion,What Happens if America's 2.5 Million Farmworkers Get Sick?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/opinion/coronavirus-farm-workers.html,"Like health care workers and emergency medical workers, America's farmworkers, like these in Oxnard, Calif., are putting themselves in harm's way for the rest of us.

A century ago in ""The Jungle,"" Upton Sinclair wrote about how the teeming tenements and meatpacking houses where workers lived and labored were perfect breeding grounds for tuberculosis as it swept the country. Now there is a new pathogenic threat and the workers who feed us are once again in grave danger. America's 2.5 million farmworkers are among the groups most at risk of contracting the coronavirus. And if they are at risk, our food supply may be too. Picture yourself waking up in a decrepit, single-wide trailer packed with a dozen strangers, four of you to every room, all using the same cramped bathroom and kitchen before heading to work. You ride to and from the fields in the back of a hot, repurposed school bus, shoulder-to-shoulder with 40 more strangers, and when the workday is done, you wait for your turn to shower and cook before you can lay your head down to sleep. That is life for far too many farmworkers in our country today. Those conditions, the result of generations of grinding poverty and neglect, will act like a superconductor for the transmission of the coronavirus. And if something isn't done -- now -- to address their unique vulnerability, the men and women who plant, cultivate and harvest our food will face a decimating wave of contagion and misery in a matter of weeks, if not days.

Their dilemma is painfully simple: The two most promising measures for protecting ourselves from the virus and preventing its spread -- social distancing and self-isolation -- are effectively impossible in farmworker communities. There are no seats in the bus that will provide the six feet of separation necessary to ward off the killer virus. There are no empty rooms in the trailer available for a sick worker to recover in while his or her meals are left outside the door. And all the remaining preventive measures in the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention playbook -- hand-washing, elbow-coughing -- can only slow the virus, they can't stop it. For farmworkers, like the 25,000 in Immokalee, Fla., where I helped found the Coalition of Immokalee Workers nearly three decades ago, the curve of contagion will be particularly steep. Once one worker in a house, or on a crew, gets sick, it's only a matter of time before his or her housemates and co-workers do, too. And then the virus is off, racing across the community from crew to crew, from trailer to trailer. To make matters worse, farmworkers have never had adequate access to health care. Even before Covid-19, there were no hospital beds here in Immokalee: no ventilators, no intensive care units, no medical professionals trained to staff them. No access to transportation, private or public, to the nearest hospital. And hospitals in the nearest large town, Naples, will quickly be overrun when the virus spikes, leaving people from Immokalee with nowhere to turn for urgent medical help.

The final ingredient in this recipe for an uncontrollable outbreak? Farmworkers have been designated essential workers -- no food workers, no food. This puts farmworkers in an awful bind: They can't afford to get sick by going to work, and they can't afford to lose their jobs by not working. And so they toil, protected by little more than hope. The message to our country's farmworkers is unmistakable: While your labor is essential, you are expendable. That is wrong, both morally and for our nation's food security. We can't treat the people who harvest our food as expendable. Like health care workers and emergency medical workers, they are putting themselves in harm's way for the rest of us. We need to take steps now, ahead of the surge of cases, to erect fully staffed field hospitals like those being established in many urban communities -- with both advanced lifesaving medical resources for those fighting for their lives and beds for those with more minor symptoms but no means to self-isolate at home -- in communities like Immokalee. Preparations must start today if they are to be effective. Despite this dire picture, however, farmworkers and growers alike are stepping up to stave off the virus for as long as possible. Here in Immokalee, farmworker leaders with our organization are creating and safely distributing multilingual educational materials, while many growers who participate in our Fair Food Program are taking significant measures to keep workers safe -- from buying groceries for their crews to help blunt the economic impact of the pandemic and avoid countless individual trips to the store, to donating hand-washing stations to be placed in strategic locations around the community. But it's not enough. The threat to farmworkers is a threat to us all -- not only because, to quote Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., we are all ""tied up in a single garment of destiny."" but also because farmworkers feed us all. No food workers, no food. It's that simple. Greg Asbed, a founder of the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, received a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 2017 for his role in developing the Fair Food Program to protect farm workers' human rights.

Opinion,"'Parasite' Won, but Asian-Americans Are Still Losing",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/opinion/parasite-oscar-best-picture.html,"As children during China's 1949 revolution, my parents, like so many Chinese of their generation, fled the Communist takeover of the mainland. Many of them planned to return when the Communist leadership collapsed. It doesn't appear that any of them will live to see it. Both sides of my family landed for a while on Taiwan and then, in the early 1970s, my parents came to the United States, where I was born not long after. I grew up in Colorado as the only person of Asian descent in most of the environments I lived in, and so learned to assimilate into American culture while rejecting, sometimes violently, my parents and their culture. And so I looked on with anxiety -- and some measure of fear -- as the South Korean film ""Parasite"" won four Academy Awards on Sunday evening, including the biggest prize of all, best picture. The victory of ""Parasite"" is a stunning moment that may not also be a watershed moment. It's certainly cause for celebration that an organization with notoriously questionable taste seems to have gotten it right this year, and it's unquestionably huge for the South Korean film industry. But despite the initial euphoric reaction from many Asian-Americans, the ""Parasite"" victory has nothing to do with Asian-American representation. This is merely Hollywood recognizing, very belatedly, South Korea's amazing film industry -- which has been making superlative films for decades.

The social media chatter around these wins has quickly become polarized. For the left, the victory of ""Parasite"" represents a validation of diversity initiatives undertaken by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in recent years. The prominent Asian-American film critic Justin Chang of The Los Angeles Times observed, cautiously, that it was ""a sign, perhaps, that the academy's efforts to diversify its ranks and become a truly global institution are having an imperfect but measurable effect."" For the right, it's more fuel for the fear machine. It's evidence of, if not the beginnings of a new Yellow Peril, a progressive media conspiracy to frustrate conservatives' pursuit of an increasingly authoritarian nationalism. Even before ""Parasite"" won best picture, Jon Miller, a prominent host on the conservative outlet BlazeTV, complained to his nearly 60,000 Twitter followers about ""a man named Bong Joon Ho"" winning the screenplay award over ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood"" and ""1917"":

The lingering aftershocks of the honors for ""Parasite"" will satisfy some of the hopes and stoke some of the fears of both sides of the social divide. The left's belief that Mr. Bong's film is a remarkable of-the-moment statement about how fed up the 99 percent are with the greedy 1 percent is valid. In a way few films ever have, ""Parasite"" captures the spirit of its time by nailing the dissatisfaction with the ruling elite that is driving the Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren campaigns and, paradoxically, carried Donald Trump to office in 2016. And the right's belief that the film's awards were a craven effort by the academy's voters to counter last year's loathsome win for ""Green Book"" (and atone for this year's repeat of a near-#OscarsSoWhite repeat) probably holds some kernel of truth as well. But I'm hesitant to give too much credit to the academy for its sudden interest in ""inclusion."" Caught in the middle are Asian-Americans. For many of us, our great hope for representation at the Oscars wasn't ""Parasite,"" it was Lulu Wang's ""The Farewell,"" about a young Asian-American woman who at a time of personal crisis is confronted with the widening cultural gulf between herself and her parents and grandmother. Alas, ""The Farewell,"" despite finding popular success and recognition at the Golden Globes and the Film Independent Spirit Awards, garnered no Oscar nominations. I find its exclusion a better indicator of how not just Asian-Americans but also female directors are still seen in Hollywood.

As a child, I was frequently asked if I knew Bruce Lee. For my classmates, there were two Asian people: me and Bruce Lee. The belief that there is only one Asian culture and not dozens, some with entrenched dislikes and prejudices against one another, has been one major source of misunderstanding between the East and the West. What ""The Farewell"" gets right about my specific experience of being an Asian-American is the idea that we are as foreign and alien in China as we are in the United States. It captures exactly the feeling of being culturally homeless. The win for ""Parasite"" is a win for Asian-Americans only if Asian-Americans buy into the prevailing generic notions around Asian culture. But I didn't know Bruce Lee. I don't know Bong Joon Ho, either. There is a quiet, yearning part of me that wants to just celebrate all of those faces that look like mine. But the nervous, weather-beaten part of me worries that Hollywood will simply start strip-mining Korean product and luring Korean talent to the United States to humiliate them as sidekicks in action cop franchises. Hollywood did this with Hong Kong's cinema in the 1990s. The biggest star on the planet, Jackie Chan, was never able to be much more than Chris Tucker's straight man in a series of ""Rush Hour"" films that featured a running joke that Mr. Chan's character was Japanese. Given China's difficult history with Japan -- reports vary among historians, but it's widely accepted that at least 14 million Chinese people died during the second Sino-Japanese War -- that's a pretty loaded jab. Even Bruce Lee found himself cast by a racist industry as the driver in ""The Green Hornet"" and, among other things, a homophobic hothead who leaps off a building after being called ""gay"" in the 1969 movie ""Marlowe."" When a white man was cast in Mr. Lee's place in ""Kung Fu,"" a show he helped to develop, he returned to Hong Kong to finally find the success he longed for. It's important to remember the provincialism of the Oscars, which Mr. Bong himself acknowledged last fall in an interview with Vulture. The Academy Awards, he said, are ""not an international film festival."" Instead, ""they're very local.""",The victory for Bong Joon Ho's film at the Oscars has nothing to do with representation of people like me.,8e663827-5d95-591b-907d-255d195b8ba7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/opinion/sunday/10Chaw/10Chaw-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0d0e23f51233701724e4d5749a45c8e2cc9f93cbd937787f06fb5a0b2b659334&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bong Joon Ho, the director of ""Parasite,"" accepting one of the four Oscars the film won on Sunday at the Academy Awards.",8e663827-5d95-591b-907d-255d195b8ba7,N24News/imgs/8e663827-5d95-591b-907d-255d195b8ba7.jpg,11
Real Estate,New York Rents Fall as Vacancies Rise,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/realestate/new-york-rents-fall-as-vacancies-rise.html,"The pandemic has hurt New York City's rental market. Prices are down, and concessions and vacancies are up.





The coronavirus lockdown has hit New York City's rental market hard, driving Manhattan vacancy rates to their highest level in 14 years and pushing the number of June new lease signings to the lowest level seen in nearly a decade, according to a new report from the brokerage Douglas Elliman. In late June, after roughly three months of coronavirus lockdown and after thousands of New York renters left the city to shelter elsewhere, real estate brokers started showing apartments to prospective renters again, a shift that many landlords were optimistic would revive the spring's sluggish rental market. But the latest numbers show that vacancy rates are now at 3.67 percent compared to 1.61 percent in June 2019. Manhattan median rental prices, meanwhile, dipped 4.8 percent compared to June of last year, to $3,378 a month, wiping out the increases of the last few years. Concessions were up, too, both in the percentage of listings offering them and the amount of the concession.

""The shutdown basically froze pricing at March/April levels,"" said Jonathan Miller, a New York appraiser and the author of the report. ""When a market is shut down for safety concerns, there is very little transparency. The reopening the last eight days of June were too short to really have an impact on monthly results, but more weakness in the market will be revealed when transparency increases."" The reopening allowed in-person property showings and persuaded many landlords to list properties last month, hopeful that pent-up demand would drive lease signings. In Manhattan, listing inventory jumped 84.7 percent compared to June of 2019, with 10,789 rental properties hitting the market. But renters aren't biting, at least not yet: just 3,171 new leases were signed, down 35.6 percent compared to 2019. Gary Malin, chief operating officer of the Corcoran Group, pointed out that there would naturally be some lag time between a listings surge and new lease signings, especially because the reopening happened right before the Fourth of July. But, he added, there was no denying that the coronavirus had been a ""shock to the system."" ""The June rental data should not come as a surprise to anyone,"" said Mr. Malin. ""For the last three months we could only do virtual showings."" There is also uncertainty because start dates for many new jobs have shifted while others have been told they can continue to work from home at least until Labor Day. ""The market has to reset itself."" Still, given the imbalance in the market, that reset will almost certainly accelerate what have, to many renters' disappointment, so far been very minor price adjustments and concessions.

John Walkup of UrbanDigs, a real estate data firm, said nearly 1,500 new Manhattan listings came on the market the week of the reopening, about 500 more than you'd see in a normal June. ""And while we've seen a slow but steady increase in leases signed, it's low compared to last year, so the question is 'What will happen with that excess inventory?' ""
* None
* Testing the Limits: Only three of New York's 25 tallest residential buildings have completed safety tasks required by the city.
* The Downside to Life in a Supertall: 432 Park faces some significant design problems, and other luxury high-rises may share its fate.
* Luxury Developers' Loophole: Soaring towers are able to push high into the sky because of a loophole in the city's labyrinthine zoning laws.
* An Evolving Skyline: The high-rise building boom has transformed the city's skyline in recent years. Its impact will echo for years to come.
* Hidden Feats: Our critic looks at some supertall N.Y.C. buildings and how the ingenuity of engineers helped build landmarks. ""Everything is supply and demand,"" said Mr. Malin. ""And there's a lot of supply but much less demand. Now that everyone is beginning to see what is out there, owners will modify their prices. But most landlords are not going to make a quick decision to do a big price cut. They'll see what the numbers are, what the traffic is like, what the offers are."" In Queens, median rental prices in June were down 5.7 percent year over year, to $2,700 a month, according to Douglas Elliman. Brooklyn rental prices were essentially flat, but there were more and deeper concessions in each borough and they showed the same imbalance as Manhattan, with huge increases in new listings and annual declines in new leases. While lease signings are expected to pick up in July, that may not extend to all segments of the market. Larger, luxury apartments, for example, saw some of the biggest price drops over the last few months, a phenomenon Mr. Miller attributed to the high-end market being more mobile. And wealthy New Yorkers who left the city when the pandemic hit and are comfortably ensconced in country homes for the summer are unlikely to rush back to sign new leases before fall. It's too soon to know how many of those who left the city will relocate permanently, but the ongoing uncertainty of the coronavirus situation -- especially the announcement on Wednesday that the city's public schools would open only part-time in the fall -- may mean that other renters will delay their apartment hunts as well, especially if they have the flexibility to do so and don't find the current rental prices compelling. ""It's certainly not a strong or normal market by any stretch of the imagination. Prices are falling, concessions are rising, the amount of concessions are rising,"" said Mr. Miller. ""Everything is weakening. In many ways, I think the rental market could be hit way bigger than the sales market."" For weekly email updates on residential real estate news, sign up here.

Style,"Bridget Everett, Curves and All",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/style/bridget-everett-curves-and-all.html,"An encounter with Bridget Everett, for some of us at least, means acquiring a new vocabulary, terms like ""meatballs,"" ""slingshots,"" ""low-riders"" and ""slip-and-sliders."" Turns out that in Ms. Everett's colorful lexicon, they are synonyms for ""breasts,"" expressions she drops routinely in ""Rock Bottom,"" her wildly ribald thrice-weekly cabaret show at Joe's Pub. ""Motorboating""? That occurs when Ms. Everett accosts an audience member, usually male, and, with a shake-and-bake jiggle, cradles his head in her bosom. Said bosom, scarcely concealed during the performance by a kind of jerry-built shower curtain masquerading as a costume, was on partial view on an icy Monday night during an interview at the Library at the Public, the richly timbered saloon tucked away at the rear of the Public Theater. Ms. Everett sailed into the room, a Valkyrie in a diaphanous, lily-patterned frock -- an off-duty number she had sourced, she said, ""by Googling trendy clothes for big girls.""

She knew she was risking a wardrobe malfunction. ""Is this too much?"" she asked, coyly tilting her chest toward a photographer sitting opposite her. ""I want to make sure it pops."" Ms. Everett's sizable proportions, are, after all, central to her shtick, the sort of down-and-dirty patter that big girls can get away with and Kate Moss types rarely do. Her curves are part of an arsenal of eye-catching props that include the plastic sex toy that, during the show, she tucked beneath her cascade of rhumba ruffles, or the brown paper bag that concealed a steady supply of Chardonnay. Offstage, she was only marginally more ladylike, sipping her wine from a proper glass. ""It helps with the nerves,"" she said. ""Like Elaine Stritch used to say, 'I'm not going out there alone.' ""

Not that she needed the lubricant. ""I've always had an adult sense of humor, and kind of a dirty mouth,"" she said. ""I wasn't locking it up. But there was no shame behind it.""

Her propensity for candor and salty talk is a legacy of a curiously liberal upbringing. ""When I was 8, I flirted with the high school boys,"" Ms. Everett said. If her antics raised eyebrows, she was unaware. Either way, ""I think people never had the nerve to call me a slut."" These days, at age 42, she added, ""It's really nice to find a line of work that lines up with who I am."" Before decamping to New York from Manhattan, Kan., where she grew up, ""I thought the be-all-end-all was Barry Manilow,"" she said. ""I just thought, 'It can't get better than that.' "" She discovered her metier not long after arriving, her stage persona shaped in part by cabaret performers like her friend, the comedian and drag entertainer Murray Hill, and Kiki & Herb. ""They were lawless, funny and razor sharp,"" she said. ""They had an intimacy and immediacy that I didn't get in Kansas."" Her aim, she said, is to uncork a similarly unfettered response in her audiences. ""I'm the one whipping everyone up into a frenzy,"" she said. ""I want people to feel unlocked. It's funny to just watch them leave themselves for a moment.""","A night out with the alt-cabaret performer included her cradling an audience member's head in her bosom and admitting that when she was 8, she flirted with high school boys.",13769491-3474-5b82-9af2-438d08c08412,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/fashion/15NIGHTOUT/15NIGHTOUT-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=bb0429fe7ec0fb007a340de47f3b76a1c6410121c69ed9777477e5c912173f67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The cabaret performer Bridget Everett at the Library at the Public, where she recently spoke about her life with her typical candor and wit.",13769491-3474-5b82-9af2-438d08c08412,N24News/imgs/13769491-3474-5b82-9af2-438d08c08412.jpg,15
Food,The New York City Wine and Food Festival Moves Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/dining/nycwff-at-home.html,"The annual summer Food & Wine Classic in Aspen, Colo., has been canceled. But the New York City Wine and Food Festival, a four-day fall fund-raiser that sprawls across the city in restaurants and event spaces? Not so fast. Lee Schrager, the organizer and founder, is going digital with it, starting this week, and still hopes the festival will return in October. (He was able to slip in the South Beach edition in Miami just under the wire in February.) Now with the gala atmosphere at tastings, lunches, cocktail gatherings and dinners falling victim to social distancing, the festival has added NYCWFF at Home, with sessions, mainly classes, featuring food celebrities and chefs a few times a week. Participants, up to 300 per session, pay $20 each and can join via Zoom. There will even be a 15-minute Q. and A. at the end of each event. All the money goes to the National Restaurant Association's Restaurant Employee Relief Fund. First up on Monday at 2:30 p.m. will be Neil Patrick Harris cooking with his husband, David Burtka; Wednesday will feature Alex Guarnaschelli and her daughter. Plans are for it to continue for months to come.

Technology,Jack Dorsey Vows to Donate $1 Billion to Fight the Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/technology/jack-dorsey-donate-1-billion-coronavirus.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Jack Dorsey, the chief executive of Twitter and Square, said on Tuesday that he planned to donate $1 billion, or just under a third of his total wealth, to relief programs related to the coronavirus, in one of the more significant efforts by a tech billionaire to fight the pandemic. Mr. Dorsey said he would put 28 percent of his wealth, in the form of shares in his mobile payments company Square, into a limited liability company that he had created, called Start Small. Start Small would make grants to beneficiaries, he said, with the expenditures to be recorded in a publicly accessible Google document. ""Why now? The needs are increasingly urgent, and I want to see the impact in my lifetime,"" Mr. Dorsey said in a series of tweets announcing his plans. ""I hope this inspires others to do something similar.""

Oprah Winfrey has donated more than $10 million of her personal wealth to Covid-19 relief efforts, while other Hollywood personalities -- including Justin Timberlake, Dolly Parton and Rihanna -- have also made contributions. Last week, the Amazon chief executive, Jeff Bezos, said he would donate $100 million to American food banks through a nonprofit, Feeding America. And Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive of Facebook, has also organized relief campaigns through Facebook and his own philanthropic organization, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. Even so, Mr. Dorsey's contribution stands out for the sum he is putting in and for how much of his net worth that represents. Square declined a request for an interview with Mr. Dorsey. Twitter declined to comment. In creating a limited liability company, Mr. Dorsey is following a model that Mr. Zuckerberg has used. In 2015, when Mr. Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan, set up the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, it was organized as an L.L.C., holding much of their wealth to fund charitable causes. At the time, critics said the vehicle was a self-serving maneuver that allowed Mr. Zuckerberg to engage in private lobbying, for-profit investment and political donations. Mr. Zuckerberg pushed back, saying a limited liability company gave him and his wife more control over how their resources would be put to use.

Mr. Dorsey, who has been criticized in the past for his lack of transparency around philanthropic efforts, said he was creating an L.L.C. for flexibility and pledged to use the Google document to update the public on its latest grants, stock transfers and sales. He said the first $100,000 donation would be to America's Food Fund, a high-profile effort committed to feeding the hungry. It was started in a GoFundMe page last week by Leonardo DiCaprio, Laurene Powell Jobs and Apple. After the most pressing matters of the pandemic are resolved, Mr. Dorsey said, he plans to shift the aim of Start Small to supporting initiatives around universal basic income, under which Americans would get a base level of regular income from the federal government, and women's health and education efforts. Universal basic income has been a pet issue for some Silicon Valley progressives, made more popular in recent months by the now-ended presidential candidacy of Andrew Yang, a Democrat who ran partly on the idea. ""Life is too short, so let's do everything we can today to help people now,"" Mr. Dorsey tweeted, followed by an emoji of a peace sign hand gesture.",The founder of Twitter and Square said he was putting nearly a third of his total wealth toward the effort.,e14eae31-9c40-510c-883a-f544edef8ccc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/business/07virus-dorsey/07virus-dorsey-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5f9d75944edafa77666291f922eb6c79de54d543abc7e99697ddf036879e2f7a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""I hope this inspires others to do something similar,"" Jack Dorsey, chief executive of Square and Twitter, said on Tuesday.",e14eae31-9c40-510c-883a-f544edef8ccc,N24News/imgs/e14eae31-9c40-510c-883a-f544edef8ccc.jpg,20
Theater,Loneliness and Loss Made Gloriously Alive in 2 Classic Dramas,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/theater/london-theater-long-days-journey-into-night-julius-caesar.html,"LONDON -- Loneliness cuts like a scythe in the appropriately mournful revival of ""Long Day's Journey Into Night,"" which plays through April 7 at Wyndham's Theater, with limited New York and Los Angeles runs to follow. And nowhere is that sense of a wayward soul trying to find companionship and peace more achingly apparent than in the Mary Tyrone offered by the unerringly fine Lesley Manville. Playing the morphine-addicted matriarch of a household of men who cannot help wounding Mary even as they watch over her, Ms. Manville communicates a roiling anger, alongside an acute sense of self-reproach for a once-vital young beauty who has turned, in the language of Eugene O'Neill's epic drama, into ""a lying dope fiend."" O'Neill famously said that this autobiographical study in would-be catharsis was ""written in tears and blood,"" and it was not staged until 1956, three years after his death.

For the bulk of this production, Mr. Eyre and his company, which includes an impassioned Jeremy Irons in a rare West End appearance, hit every note one could wish for on a spectrum encompassing dissolution and devotion, affection and an abiding frustration that has curdled into something resembling rage. (Intriguingly, Rob Howell's semitransparent set suggests regions unknown, as if the emotions of this particular hothouse cannot be contained.) From the very start, the actors, talking over and across one another, convey a family so attuned to one another's rhythms that they can anticipate the next sentence. This approach echoes the one taken more than 30 years ago by the director Jonathan Miller in a production that starred a peculiarly cast Jack Lemmon, and it serves the practical purpose of eating away at what can -- in sleepier, slower hands -- result in a four-hour running time. (This production clocks in at three and a half hours, including intermission.) There's a near-Chekhovian sense of self-inquiry to Mary's ceaseless monitoring of her state of mind, not to mention her gathering panic at her rheumatic fingers. An Oscar nominee for her tight-lipped turn as Daniel Day-Lewis's sister in ""Phantom Thread,"" Ms. Manville has reaffirmed my growing belief that ""Long Day's Journey"" is Mary's play -- and one has a feeling that O'Neill wouldn't want it any other way. (I suspect that he would also appreciate Mr. Irons as the rare James Tyrone who really fits the onetime dashing theatrical titan described so fully in the text.) The sense that Mary rules the roost is in no way meant to diminish the company around her, although Rory Keenan and Matthew Beard, playing the variably infirm and combative Tyrone sons, don't quite deliver the scathing force of their 11th-hour face-off. That's the defining scene in which Mr. Keenan's Jamie finds it within himself to advise Mr. Beard's consumptive and willowy Edmund to beware a wastrel older brother in gathering thrall to drink. Both actors may find a deeper connection with time: They are new to this production, first seen in April 2016 to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Bristol Old Vic (Mr. Irons trained at the theater school there).

Mr. Beard, a 2015 Tony nominee, has the advantage of looking as if he could be a child of Mr. Irons and Ms. Manville, and he is at his best in Edmund's revelatory encounters with each parent in turn. As Ms. Manville's Mary clucks over Edmund like some deeply haunted mother hen, one clocks the affinity between a son on deathwatch and a mother delivering herself into an oblivion that can be said to constitute a living death.

The barnstorming thespian James Tyrone knows his Shakespeare -- and is particularly fond of quoting ""Julius Caesar."" That play's themes of treachery and betrayal find a domestic equivalent in ""Long Day's Journey,"" where familial banter can turn from love to hate and back again with a mere sweep of the floor-length dressing gown that Mr. Irons wears with style. But I doubt even he would be prepared for the visceral thrill of Nicholas Hytner's electric reckoning with this oft-performed play currently at the Bridge Theater through April 15. (It will be broadcast in movie theaters via NT Live on March 22.) A new theater that got off to a faltering start last fall with the Richard Bean play ""Young Marx"" comes into its own here. This is the third and by some measure the best ""Julius Caesar"" I have seen in the past nine months. Its skill lies in making the Roman citizenry a force to be dealt with (and perhaps alarmed by) in a play where populist dynamics resonate in any number of ways with the realpolitik at large today. There is an option to stand for the two-hour duration (no intermission) in what is, in effect, a Shakespearean mosh pit. If you can manage it, getting down with the crowd is the way to go. In keeping with the greater emphasis of late on gender parity in the classics, the Cassius here is Michelle Fairley (Lady Catelyn Stark on ""Game of Thrones""). A stage regular who is infrequently seen in Shakespeare, Ms. Fairley counters the outsize bombast of a rhetoric-heavy play with a whispery quietude that prompts one to consider Cassius and Ben Whishaw's angsty, bookish Brutus not just as conspirators but also as would-be lovers. (In this case, it's no wonder that Portia, Brutus's hapless wife, is self-harming.) The company includes David Morrissey as an especially bullish Mark Antony, and David Calder as a Caesar possessed of paper-thin bonhomie and a disorienting gift for talking about himself in the third person. As the corpses mount, those spectators moving about as required on the stage floor become a keen-eyed, flag-waving mob waiting to see where demagoguery will take us next. The play's last line may against all sense reference ""this happy day,"" but Mr. Hytner's unsparing analysis opens our eyes to a ""Julius Caesar"" marked out at every turn by loss.

Food,"Autumn Brings Breweries, Bars and a Taproom",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/24/dining/new-york-city-beer-brewery.html,"* None   Cole Wilson for The New York Times

The newest addition to New York City's beer scene is a familiar brew. After more than two years of delays, Jeppe Jarnit-Bjergso plans to finally open Evil Twin Brewing New York City. Until now, he has been making his beer using other people's equipment , but in November, he'll establish his own brewery in a dilapidated ballroom in Ridgewood, Queens, producing an array of I.P.A.s as well as beers aged in wine and spirits barrels , many available only on site. After more than two years of delays, the gypsy brewery Evil Twin plans this fall to open its first brick-and-mortar brewery, in Ridgewood, Queens. Cole Wilson for The New York Times They'll be served in three distinct spaces: an intimate indoor bar, a gravel-lined beer garden and a year-round glass greenhouse with seating for about 75, rain or shine. Fette Sau, the Williamsburg barbecue specialist, will operate a permanent food truck, offering smoked brisket and more. ""It'll be like walking into an oasis,"" Mr. Jarnit-Bjergso said. As New York City's beer scene continues to expand, so have the ambitions for this fall's new bars, brewery taprooms and beer gardens. They're outdoing the competition, and their previous locations, with an outsize approach to selling beer. Developed in Italy, the Teku glasses help concentrate the delicate fragrances of Beer Street's collection of sours, I.P.A.s and more. Cole Wilson for The New York Times At Beer Street, two napkin-topped beers patiently await their owners' return. Cole Wilson for The New York Times Beer Street, in Williamsburg, is currently one of Brooklyn's smallest beer bars, specializing in highly regarded, locally brewed farmhouse ales, sours and I.P.A.s. In December, it will expand to a second, much larger location in the Pacific Park development in Prospect Heights, near the Barclays Center. ""I'm used to holes and caves. This is kind of bonkers,"" the managing partner Cory Bonfiglio said of the bright, 2,500-square-foot space. There, Beer Street will serve cultish brews from the likes of Other Half and Kent Falls in aroma-enhancing Teku glassware , as well as cider on tap and drinks available only at this location, like draft wine, cocktails and sodas seasoned with bay leaves. ""I like providing interesting nonalcoholic options,"" said Mr. Bonfiglio, whose menu will include sandwiches from Foster Sundry in Bushwick. Torch & Crown will operate locations in SoHo and, here, in the Bronx, where it produces and packages a variety of beers for itself and other breweries. Cole Wilson for The New York Times The city's brewery boom of the last five years has largely occurred in warehouses and industrial buildings outside Manhattan that offer ample space and appropriate zoning. But come October, the showy One SoHo Square towers will welcome Torch & Crown's on-site brewery, event space and full kitchen, while an adjoining alleyway is earmarked for a 2,500-square-foot outdoor beer garden. ""There's a reason that no one has done what we're doing in Manhattan,"" said John Dantzler, a founder of Torch & Crown Brewing Company. (Concurrently, the company will open a taproom at its separate Bronx brewery. ) Torch & Crown clears the used grains from its brewing system, preparing it for another brew day. Cole Wilson for The New York Times Empty kegs sit ready for another round of Torch & Crown beer. Cole Wilson for The New York Times In the 4,000-square-foot SoHo taproom the Cannibal -- a Manhattan restaurant that specializes in homemade charcuterie -- will offer beer-friendly fare paired with super-fresh, juicy I.P.A.s served from tanks installed above the bar. ""It calls attention to the fact that we're making it right there,"" said Mr. Dantzler, who will install a small brewing system for brewing demonstrations in which visitors can take part, adding hops or stirring grains.

Art & Design,The Frick Likely to Take Over the Met Breuer,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/21/arts/design/met-breuer-frick-collection.html,"In a striking development likely to surprise the art world, the Metropolitan Museum of Art is in discussions to turn over the Met Breuer to the Frick Collection. By off loading the last three years of its eight-year lease in the Madison Avenue building, the Met could free itself of an $18 million annual financial burden and focus on improving its Fifth Avenue galleries for modern and contemporary art. And the Frick could satisfy a need for temporary space while its Gilded Age mansion undergoes renovation.

Critics of the original deal will no doubt see the arrangement -- announced jointly on Friday by the Met and the Frick -- as confirmation that the Met Breuer was a bad idea to begin with, particularly since opening the Madison Avenue location forced the museum to divide its resources at a time of financial distress and to invest heavily in upgrading the building's restaurant.

But the Met said the Frick venture, which would start in 2020, merely represents an evolution in planning, from using the Met Breuer as a temporary exhibition space for modern and contemporary art to expanding that type of programming in its Fifth Avenue flagship. ""Our future is in the main building,"" Daniel Weiss, the Met's president and chief executive, said.

And while it may be hard to envision the Frick's Rembrandts, Goyas and Renoirs in the Marcel Breuer-designed Brutalist building, Ian Wardropper, the Frick's director, said the museum would use the Breuer as an opportunity to juxtapose its old master art collection with contemporary loans.

Health,"Vaginal 'Rejuvenation' Treatments May Be Unsafe, the F.D.A. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/health/vaginal-laser-fda.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration on Monday announced that it had warned several companies to stop marketing laser devices for procedures billed as ""vaginal rejuvenation,"" saying they were dangerous and deceptive treatments. The agency originally permitted the lasers and related energy-based devices onto the market for treatment of serious conditions, like cancer, genital warts, or surgery including hysterectomies. But in recent years, manufacturers have been heavily promoting the lasers for symptoms related to vaginal atrophy, menopause, urinary incontinence and sexual function. Cosmetic, spa treatments using laser and other products for vaginal health have also become popular among younger women. Some treatments use the devices to destroy or reshape vaginal tissue, which the manufacturers say can solve some problems related to dryness or other ailments. The F.D.A. disagrees. But even though the agency originally approved the devices for certain treatments, it is legal for doctors to use them for off-label conditions.

The agency noted in one letter that a manufacturer, BTL Industries, was marketing a radio-frequency device, Exilis Ultra 360, as a new approach to ""women's intimate health"" even though the product had only been approved by the F.D.A. for uses in dermatology like wrinkle treatment, including the eyelids. The F.D.A. described the company's ""pelvic-suite"" web page, where the device was advertised as able to build collagen and elasticity for ""female intimate parts,"" and requested that the company furnish documentation that it had been cleared to market the product for such uses. The agency posted copies of letters it sent to manufacturers of the MonaLisa Touch, Femilift, Venus Fiore System and other devices, telling them not to promote the devices for the rejuvenation procedure. ""These products have serious risks and don't have adequate evidence to support their use for these purposes,"" said Dr. Scott Gottlieb, the F.D.A. commissioner. ""We are deeply concerned women are being harmed."" Dr. Gottlieb also said he was concerned that deceptive marketing of these devices might prevent some patients from getting appropriate therapies for severe medical conditions. The F.D.A. said the full extent of the risks is unknown, but that the agency has found cases of vaginal burns, scarring, and lasting pain following the treatments. The agency has received 14 reports of adverse events related to the treatments, including burning sensations and significant pain.

The companies targeted by the F.D.A. were Inmode; Sciton; Alma Lasers; Thermigen; BTL Aesthetics, BTL Industries; Venus Concept and Cynosure. Some companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Jane G. Mazur, a spokeswoman for Hologic, Inc. whose subsidiary sells the MonaLisa Touch, said they were reviewing the F.D.A. notice. ""We are evaluating the letter in full and will collaborate with the agency to ensure all product communications adhere to regulatory requirements,"" Ms. Mazur said. Domenic DiSisto, general counsel for Venus Concept, said the Venus Fiore device is not currently marketed or sold in the United States, and that the company had modified its website. The F.D.A.'s letters are considered a step short of a formal warning. The manufacturers are asked to provide details on the product and on what basis they are assuming approval. The agency has been under pressure to speed up approval of medical devices. Critics have said that the F.D.A. device approvals are already going too fast and happening with insufficient oversight. In the announcement Monday, Dr. Gottlieb said the agency would strengthen its studies of devices after they have been approved for sale. No federal agency or medical society has figures for the amount of these procedures done every year, but a casual search through gynecology practices shows they are becoming prevalent -- despite opposition from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The medical society has issued several statements noting that the devices, including the MonaLisa Touch, do not have F.D.A. clearance or approval for treatment of menopausal symptoms, as advertised.

""Obstetrician-gynecologists should be cognizant of the evidence regarding innovative practices"" and should be wary ""of adopting new or innovative approaches on the basis of promotions or marketing,"" the college said. Dr. Cheryl B. Iglesia, director of the section of female pelvic medicine and reconstructive surgery at MedStar Washington Hospital Center, said the laser technology held promise, but that more study was needed to understand the safety as well as which patients the devices might help. ""I think the F.D.A. is trying to be conservative,"" she said. ""They do not want the marketing to be ahead of the science on this."" But some doctors already say the devices work well for their off-label use. In a testimonial on its website, Alma Laser featured a video of Dr. Leslie Apgar, a Maryland gynecologist, who said she was pleased with the Femilift, as well as the company's assistance with marketing. ""With Alma I was able to get the Femilift system that I wanted, along with the marketing solution that included a new website fully optimized for Google and all the other search engines,"" Dr. Apgar said in the video. ""It has worked out extremely well for me, as I have gotten new patients weekly directed to my practice.""",The agency told seven companies that sell lasers for cosmetic gynecology and related procedures to stop marketing them for unapproved uses.,18ae4daf-5fcd-5f13-aaf5-dbceb942fcad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/31/science/31DEVICE/31DEVICE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b4a302d6f1637b75a2e467d9c880e8562b53f2ccfdebf704982eef6cec289bbe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The seven companies targeted by the F.D.A. for promoting dangerous uses of laser treatments for women included Inmode, Sciton, Alma Lasers, Thermigen, BTL Aesthetics, BTL Industries and Cynosure, which makes the MonaLisa Touch.",18ae4daf-5fcd-5f13-aaf5-dbceb942fcad,N24News/imgs/18ae4daf-5fcd-5f13-aaf5-dbceb942fcad.jpg,1

The winners range from 23 to 31. Seventy-two singers were granted auditions organized by the George London Foundation, out of over 150 applicants, and 17 were chosen to compete in the finals.

For Ms. Bryce-Davis, 31, the victory completed something of a full-circle journey: She applied to the competition seven years ago without knowing its pedigree, and was promptly told by her teacher to withdraw.

Science,NASA Mission Springs a Small Leak After Touching an Asteroid,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/science/osiris-rex-asteroid.html,"An image from NASA's OSIRIS-REX spacecraft showed particles coming out of its sampling collector after an operation on Tuesday to gather rock and dirt from the asteroid Bennu for scientific study on Earth.





NASA's effort to grab a piece of an asteroid on Tuesday may have worked a little too well. The spacecraft, OSIRIS-REX, grabbed so much rock and dirt that some of the material is now leaking back into space. The operation some 200 million miles from Earth on the other side of the sun was ""almost too successful,"" Dante Lauretta, the principal investigator of the mission, said during a telephone news conference on Friday. NASA officials worried that without careful effort to secure its samples in the days ahead, the mission could lose much of the scientific payload it traveled for years across the solar system to gather. A few rocks wedged in the robotic probe's collection mechanism prevented a flap from fully closing. In images taken by the spacecraft, scientists could see bits of asteroid coming out. Dr. Lauretta estimated that each image showed about 5 to 10 grams -- up to about a third of an ounce -- of material floating around the collector. That is a significant loss as the mission's aim is to bring back at least 60 grams of asteroid dirt and rocks. ""You've got to remember the entire system is in microgravity,"" Dr. Lauretta said. The particles move as if in a fluid, ""and particles are kind of diffusing out,"" he said.

If the collection attempt had not succeeded, OSIRIS-REX could have made two more attempts. Mission managers also decided to call off two maneuvers. One, scheduled for Friday, was to slow down the spacecraft and to allow it to re-enter orbit around the asteroid Bennu, which is only about 1,600 feet in diameter. Instead, it continues to drift away at a speed of less than one mile per hour. The second one was to spin the spacecraft around on Saturday to measure how much is trapped inside the collection mechanism. But that would shake out more material. ""So that is not a prudent path to go down,"" Dr. Lauretta said. The collection of a sample was the key objective of the mission whose full name is Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer. Asteroids are primitive 4.5 billion-year-old leftovers from the earliest days of the solar system. Scientists on Earth using sophisticated instruments would be able to study the Bennu material in much more detail than any instruments on the spacecraft could.

On Tuesday, the spacecraft's collection mechanism touched the asteroid Bennu at a leisurely pace of about 1.5 inches a second. The sampling mechanism, which resembles an automobile air filter, had been designed to work on a wide variety of surfaces ranging from completely rigid -- ""Like running into a slab of concrete,"" Dr. Lauretta said -- to something much more porous. That part of Bennu turned out to be on the softer side, with the asteroid hardly pushing back at all. The sampling mechanism pushed 10 to 20 inches into the soil before the spacecraft backed away, allowing it to fill up its collector when a burst of nitrogen gas from the probe stirred up the surface. ""We could not have performed a better collection experiment,"" Dr. Lauretta said. The operation to stow the collection mechanism may start on Tuesday. Engineers are looking at how to modify the procedure to minimize the amount of material that may be shaken out into space. It will take several days before the samples are safely stored in a return capsule. OSIRIS-REX must wait until March to leave Bennu and to return to Earth, a journey that will take two and a half years. The spacecraft will drop off the return capsule, which will parachute to a landing in Utah on Sept. 24, 2023. OSIRIS-REX is the third mission to attempt to bring back pieces of an asteroid. A Japanese mission, Hayabusa, faced a series of technical malfunctions, and it barely managed to bring any samples -- about 1,500 grains -- back from an asteroid it was studying called Itokawa. The Japanese space agency sent a second mission, Hayabusa2, to a different asteroid, Ryugu. That spacecraft is on its way back to Earth and will drop its asteroid payload in the Australian Outback in December.","The OSIRIS-REX spacecraft collected rock and dirt samples from Bennu, but it appears to be losing some of what it grabbed.",ab652067-674b-528e-8f94-eb36b0686304,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/23/science/23SCI-ASTEROID-image/23SCI-ASTEROID-image-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=930e3dbc43cda58a46f2ce1726bf41d45c33cd1c71c711868da698707392545e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A series of three images shows that the sampler head on NASA's OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is so full of rocks and dust collected from the surface of the asteroid Bennu that it's shedding pieces.,ab652067-674b-528e-8f94-eb36b0686304,N24News/imgs/ab652067-674b-528e-8f94-eb36b0686304.jpg,2
Your Money,"Easing Into Leisure, One Step at a Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/03/your-money/slowing-down-in-stages-on-gradual-path-to-full-retirement.html,"At 54, Jack M. Guttentag decided to downsize. His children had grown, and he and his wife thought they should prepare for the future and move from their townhouse in Philadelphia to something countrified, a few dozen miles west in Valley Forge, Pa. ""I wasn't quite thinking about retirement, but looking toward that time,"" said Mr. Guttentag, known as the Mortgage Professor. He has long worked in that financing field as a professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and has an advice website of the same name. That was 37 years ago. Mr. Guttentag is 91 now, and last year, having been an emeritus professor since 1996, he and his wife decided to downsize again. They moved halfway back toward Philadelphia and into a one-story retirement facility with some good amenities like a movie theater, a pool and a physical fitness center with two instructors. ""Now we want to be closer to the city and the things to do there,"" Mr. Guttentag said, adding that he no longer wanted to mow the lawn -- or even find anyone to do it.

Mr. Guttentag is part of what some see as a growing trend toward retiring and downsizing in steps. In an earlier generation, people tended to do it all at once -- and only once -- typically either retiring in place or selling a house and moving to a resort area to play golf and mingle with others their age. Now an overwhelming number of older people are taking a more gradual approach, downsizing a family home and full-time career but not abandoning work or a familiar region altogether. Rather than seeking refuge in faraway warmer climates, large numbers tend to want to stay in the neighborhoods they have lived in for a long time -- even if they do move around within the area in the short term. A survey by the AARP's Public Policy Institute found that 87 percent of those age 65 and older, and 71 percent of those 50 to 64, preferred to stay close to their longtime neighborhoods and were not making the traditional choice of packing up and moving to a resort area. As people live longer -- and are healthier and more productive as they age -- the opportunity to retire and downsize multiple times increases, said Rodney Harrell, the director of livable communities for the AARP institute.

""The trend has started with those who are older now,"" Mr. Harrell said, adding, ""We don't yet know how it will be for the entire Baby Boom."" But there are signs that the more gradual approach involving multiple moves is becoming established behavior. ""They are going to want the same things that, frankly, people of a wide range of ages want: safe communities, transportation, parks and so forth,"" Mr. Harrell said, referring to those at or near retirement age today. ""But it may be in different ways over a longer span of time than their parents."" Ira and Carol Barrows are a classic case. Life was going well for the couple while in their late 50s. Ira had cut back his law practice and was helping manage his brother's restaurant, while Carol was still enjoying her career as a teacher.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' Then she got an opportunity to teach for two years in one of their favorite vacation spots, Hanoi, Vietnam. They sold their home in Doylestown, Pa., and took the adventure that they had assumed would lead them into retirement afterward. When they returned to the United States, they bought a home in Hershey, Pa., where several of Carol's relatives lived. It was smaller and -- because it was farther from the city -- much less expensive. Somehow, though, a life without work and without a full income -- Ms. Barrows had a pension, but they were a few years short of full Social Security benefits -- was unsatisfying to the couple, who loved theater, opera and upscale restaurants.

So they took jobs in security and hospitality in -- surprising, even to them -- Hersheypark, the amusement park and its sports arena. ""We said we would do it for a while and see how it worked out,"" Mr. Barrows, now 69, said. ""When it is your 'retirement job,' we found it was easier to negotiate what would be rough patches."" For five years, they each worked about 1,000 hours annually until, finally, last spring, the idea of real retirement took hold. ""It was fun a lot of the time. We were named the outstanding employees one year. We got to go to concerts and hockey games for free. It was a good transition,"" he said. ""Downsizing twice wasn't what we planned, but it turned out better than we could have thought."" Olivia S. Mitchell, a professor at the Wharton School and executive director of its Pension Research Council, said two-step retirement may be more common in the baby boom generation because of several factors. First of all, she said, there are more two-earner families doing significant work. In past generations, even if the wife worked, it was probably in something she would quit when her husband retired. Now, more women hold jobs they may find ""aspirational,"" Professor Mitchell said, and may want to stay with them, thus delaying a final major downsizing and having an interim one instead.

""I do a lot of work with people who are just finding ways not to run out of money,"" she said. ""With people living longer, that is a concern, so maybe they retire, then downsize, then go back to work, then retire again. ""Or, on the other hand, people may feel their mortality and just jump on something for a while before really downsizing,"" she said. For Stu Alexander and his wife, Dierdre Kaye, this gradual approach to a full retirement has become a long-term lifestyle. They had already moved once and changed careers. In 1996, when they were both 46, they left Minnesota for Arizona and, giving up their former careers as a state recreation director and a sales executive, started writing, directing and acting, eventually opening up their own theater. ""We thought we would do this for 10 or 15 years and then really retire,"" said Mr. Alexander. But in October 2012, at a seniors softball tournament, he went through a complimentary health screening that showed an elevated blood sugar level. When he returned home, his doctor told him he had diabetes, and a month later, short of breath on a hike, he found he had clogged arteries and soon had triple-bypass heart surgery. ""When I recovered, there was no thought but to really live out our dream before anything else happened,"" he said. For the last two years, they have traveled in their recreational vehicle around North America for six months at a time, alternating with six months at home in Arizona. It's a schedule they hope to maintain over the next eight years. They travel slowly and tow a compact car that they can use for day trips around whatever campground they have chosen. Mr. Alexander has long been a self-described baseball fanatic, so they plan to catch games in all 30 major league parks by the end of this year, their third on this retirement voyage. ""When we're done, we'll be 72. That should be the time we'll be slowing down for real,"" said Mr. Alexander, who still writes, particularly about his travels. ""I guess we will have retired three times in a way, one step at a time.""","A growing number of Americans are downsizing and retiring in multiple steps, continuing to work at least part time and moving more than once.",1b117c0f-13e0-5497-9ad2-f0b65d0bb4b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/03/business/RETIRING/RETIRING-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=2baa90aad2f6a0f68c8a81d5aeaf3cd3816cdc2c81fb6d5c96ab7048a7ec2935&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jack Guttentag, 91, a former Wharton School professor, with his wife, Doris, 89, retired to suburban Philadelphia in 1996 and then to a one-story retirement community closer to the city in 2013.",1b117c0f-13e0-5497-9ad2-f0b65d0bb4b9,N24News/imgs/1b117c0f-13e0-5497-9ad2-f0b65d0bb4b9.jpg,21

Technology,Australia Bars China's Huawei From Building 5G Wireless Network,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/23/technology/huawei-banned-australia-5g.html,"BEIJING -- The fog of cyberespionage concerns surrounding Huawei has for years kept the Chinese technology giant largely out of the United States. Now it has cost the company potentially lucrative business in another country: Australia. Huawei said on Thursday that the Australian government had barred it and another Chinese company, ZTE, from providing equipment to support the country's new telecommunications networks. Mobile carriers around the world have been preparing to build infrastructure using fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless technology, which promises to enable the ultrafast communications necessary for technologies such as self-driving cars. On Twitter, Huawei called the decision an ""extremely disappointing result for consumers."" In a statement, the company said it ""will continue to engage with the Australian government, and in accordance with Australian law and relevant international conventions, we will take all possible measures to protect our legal rights and interests.""

Huawei, one of the world's largest makers of telecom gear and smartphones, already sells equipment to major Australian telecom carriers. The company wrote to Australian lawmakers recently, arguing that concerns that its gear could be used by the Chinese government for spying were ""ill informed and not based on facts."" But in a statement on Thursday, two Australian ministers indicated that the government would move to exclude certain equipment vendors from the nation's 5G networks. Companies that ""are likely to be subject to extrajudicial directions from a foreign government"" pose unacceptable security risks, the ministers said. One of those ministers, Scott Morrison, is challenging Australia's prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, for leadership of the country. Neither Huawei nor ZTE was specifically named in the Australian statement. But the two companies' ties to Beijing have long been cited by United States officials to justify keeping them out of American mobile networks. Huawei has said repeatedly that it is a private company owned by its employees, and that it obeys the law wherever it operates. Still, large American wireless carriers have for years shunned both its and ZTE's equipment.

With such concerns about Chinese technology continuing to spread globally, it seems increasingly unlikely that the tech cold war between China and the United States will be reconciled quickly. More and more, the two economic powerhouses view the race to develop key technologies, 5G wireless included, in strategic as well as commercial terms. Both have stood up for their own national tech champions. And they have each sought to kneecap the other's. ZTE was nearly driven out of business this year after the United States Department of Commerce barred American firms from selling components to the company. The sanctions, imposed as punishment for illegal sales made by ZTE in Iran and North Korea, were later lifted to help defuse tensions between President Trump and China's leader, Xi Jinping. Even Chinese firms' research partnerships with universities in the United States and Canada have come under scrutiny. In June, a group of Washington lawmakers wrote to Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, calling for a review of American universities' collaborations with Huawei. In response, Huawei's deputy chairman, Eric Xu, hit out at the politicians, saying that ""their minds are still in the agrarian age."" Mr. Xu added: ""Their behavior shows not just an ignorance of how science and innovation works today, but also their own lack of confidence.""",American officials have long worried that Chinese tech firms such as Huawei and ZTE could be involved in espionage.

Television,"Dena Dietrich, Who Found TV Fame as Mother Nature, Dies at 91",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/arts/television/dena-dietrich-dead.html,"Dena Dietrich was a familiar face on television in the 1970s, speaking the words ""It's not nice to fool Mother Nature"" in a quiet, threatening voice in commercials for Chiffon margarine.





Dena Dietrich, the kindly face and fearsome power of Mother Nature to American television viewers in the 1970s, died on Saturday in Los Angeles. She was 91. The death was announced by SAG-AFTRA, the actors' union. Ms. Dietrich was in her early 40s in 1971 when she filmed the first of the television commercials that made her image famous. Dressed as a goddess in a diaphanous white gown, wearing fresh flowers in her hair, she strolled serenely through forests and fields, stopping to dip her pinkie into a small bowl for a taste of ""my sweet, creamy butter."" When an offscreen voice informed her that what she was tasting was actually Chiffon margarine, the goddess snapped, declaring in a quiet but threatening voice, ""It's not nice to fool Mother Nature."" She then raised her outspread arms, thunder roared, lightning bolts flashed and -- in some versions of the commercial -- wild animals stampeded.

During the 1980s and '90s, she had guest roles on dozens of series, including the comedies ""Murphy Brown,"" ""Mad About You"" and ""Life With Lucy"" and the dramas ""NYPD Blue"" and ""Thirtysomething."" She was a prison guard on ""Trapper John, M.D."" (1981) and a self-important psychic conducting seances on ""All My Children"" (1994). In a two-part episode of ""The Golden Girls"" in 1991, she was Bea Arthur's visiting sister, who has a brief affair with the ex-husband of Ms. Arthur's character.

""Yes, baby, yes,"" she murmurs to the animal in one scene. ""All these bad people."" Deanne Frances Dietrich was born on Dec. 4, 1928, in Pittsburgh, the daughter of Mahlon Lloyd Dietrich, an electrician, and Helen (Wilson) Dietrich. After graduating from West View High School, she studied acting at HB Studios and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York. She appeared in a variety of Off Broadway productions, among them ""The Rimers of Eldritch"" (1967), a murder drama by Lanford Wilson, at the Cherry Lane Theater. What would have been her Broadway debut -- ""The Freaking Out of Stephanie Blake"" (1967), a generation-gap comedy -- closed in previews, reportedly because its Hollywood star, Jean Arthur, was ill. Ms. Dietrich's first official Broadway appearance was also brief: ""Here's Where I Belong,"" a musical based on John Steinbeck's ""East of Eden,"" opened and closed on March 3, 1968. Then her luck changed. Ms. Dietrich played a sensible older sister in Mike Nichols's Broadway production of Neil Simon's ""The Prisoner of Second Avenue"" (1971). The play, starring Peter Falk and Lee Grant as Manhattanites struggling through a bad economy, ran for almost two years and won two Tony Awards. Live theater was a long-running facet of Ms. Dietrich's career. She often told the story of being the understudy for Lillian Roth, who was playing Fanny Brice's mother, in a national tour of ""Funny Girl"" in 1965. Ms. Roth made a habit of disappearing shortly before curtain time -- or during intermission. Sometimes she came back. Ms. Dietrich learned to make quick costume changes. In 2005, Ms. Dietrich was a Russian grandmother in ""At the Beach House,"" a drama by Aram Saroyan, in Los Angeles. Terry Morgan, reviewing the play in Variety, didn't think much of it but gave at least one cast member solid praise. ""Dietrich is quite good as the grandmother, who's made of tougher stuff than her descendants,"" Mr. Morgan wrote, ""and her mix of kindness with a hint of steel brings the character to life.""","In a long acting career she was best known for wreaking havoc in a series of margarine commercials, warning, ""It's not nice to fool Mother Nature.""",6765ce41-8d02-5a76-948d-14c8504aac69,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/27/obituaries/27Dietrich-obit/25Dietrich1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Dena Dietrich was a familiar face on television in the 1970s, speaking the words &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not nice to fool Mother Nature&rdquo; in a quiet, threatening voice in commercials for Chiffon margarine.",6765ce41-8d02-5a76-948d-14c8504aac69,N24News/imgs/6765ce41-8d02-5a76-948d-14c8504aac69.jpg,3

Pyeongchang and Olympic satellite cities will have free shuttle buses to Olympic game venues and also to each satellite city. For more information on schedules, visit the official Pyeongchang 2018 website, or download the official mobile app, available for Apple iPhones or Google Android devices. Also note that Verizon Wireless customers in South Korea can have their international fees waived for the month of February by signing up for its reward program.

International flights arrive at Seoul's Incheon International Airport. From the United States, Korean Air has flights to Incheon from more than a half dozen cities, including New York, Washington D.C., San Francisco and Dallas. Asiana Airlines also has flights to Incheon from five United States cities including New York, Chicago and Seattle. Visitors have numerous hotel options in and around Pyeongchang. The local Olympic organizing committee has contracted special rates at 35 hotels in the area, for a total of more than 5,300 rooms. According to the committee's accommodation newsletter, nightly rates average $265 for hotels in Pyeongchang and $90 in satellite cities. Beyond those hotels, the region has plenty of other resorts. In Pyeongchang, for example, the 214-room Holiday Inn Resort Alpensia Pyeongchang has nightly rates starting at $450 over the Olympic period, while the 419-room Holiday Inn Hotel & Suites Alpensia Pyeongchang has rates starting at $408. Rooms at either property can be reserved by calling 1-888- 465-4329, or visiting the websites for each hotel. Another option in Pyeongchang is the 238-room InterContinental Alpensia Pyeongchang Resort; nightly rates during the Olympics start at $450. Reserve by calling 1-888-424-6835 , or by visiting the hotel website.

Tickets went on sale for South Korean residents last February, but roughly 80 percent of the 750,000 tickets allocated to South Koreans were still available at the end of October. Of the 320,000 tickets set aside for international fans, 57 percent had been sold. As of Jan. 15, 67.6 percent of all available tickets have sold, according to Pyeongchang 2018 organizers. Skiing events appear to be the most sought-after. Roughly 80 percent of the total tickets for Alpine skiing and cross-country skiing were sold as of late December, the most of any sport. Currently, individual tickets for various medal-round Alpine skiing events can be had for $150 to $200 per ticket through CoSport.

Figure skating is always a premiere attraction, and this year short-track speedskating will also be in the spotlight. ""South Korea is especially good at short-track speedskating, so expect that to be a hard one to get,"" Victor Mather, a sports editor for The Times who will be on location for the Winter Games, said. Tickets for short-track speedskating are now sold out on CoSport. You should also consider lower-profile events that are fun to watch in person. Mr. Mather said the biathlon was surprisingly enjoyable during the 2014 Sochi Games, but you may want to steer clear of bobsled events. ""Watching the sled streak by is kind of cool, maybe once or twice,"" Mr. Mather said. ""But it lasts only a fraction of a second. Standing in the cold for a very brief glimpse of speeding metal isn't that great of a time."" Beyond individual tickets, CoSport had been selling package deals that combined events or included hotel accommodations and other perks, but most have sold out, according to the website. Athletes will compete in four new events this year: Big Air snowboarding, Mass Start speed skating, Mixed Doubles curling and an Alpine skiing team competition. Big Air is the latest addition to the increasingly popular snowboarding category, which added the Slopestyle event in 2014. As of mid-January, tickets were still available through CoSport for the women's Big Air final on Feb. 23 for $211 each.

Showcasing South Korea's rich culture during the Olympics is a top priority for locals, according to Choi Moon-soon, the governor of Gangwon province and the co-president of the Pyeongchang Organizing Committee. Visitors can get a taste by heading to the Cultural Olympiad, held in the Pyeongchang Olympic Plaza. The events will feature two pavilions, one highlighting modern Korean culture, the other focusing on more traditional elements. Both pavilions will have plenty of art on display and feature live performances in a variety of art forms, including music and dance. Also, from Feb. 2 to Feb. 24, Gangwon Province's tourism board is hosting a cultural festival at the Gangneung Art Center in Gangneung-si, a city about 45 minutes from Pyeongchang. The festival will showcase Korean music and dance in two to four performances a day. Korean singers and musicians will take part in performances that highlight international music and dance styles, including ballet, jazz, opera, pop music and modern dance. All shows are free to attend. Rani Cheema, a South Korea travel specialist at Tzell Travel Group, says Gangwon province is an undiscovered destination worth traveling to whether you're headed to the Olympics or not. ""It's a paradise for active travelers,"" she said. ""In winter, there's good skiing, snowboarding and trout fishing, and summer is prime for hiking and mountain climbing."" During the Olympics, she said, visitors can expect temperatures to drop below zero and advised bringing enough warm clothing. ""It will be unbelievably cold in February,"" she said. Skiers can hit the slopes at three popular resorts in Gangwon province: Yongpyong Ski Resort, Alpensia Ski Resort and Elysian Gangchon. For culture, Ms. Cheema suggested visiting her favorite Buddhist temples in the area: Naksansa, Woljeongsa and Sinheungsa. ""Buddhist temples are a sight to see all year round, but during the winter, especially if the snow is falling, you'll feel like you traveled back in time,"" she said. Depending on where you stay, your hotel concierge can help plan additional excursions in the area.","The 2018 Winter Olympics start on Feb. 9 in Gangwon Province, a resort region in the Taebak Mountains northeast of Seoul.

Fashion & Style,Balenciaga's New Balance,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/07/fashion/paris-fashion-week-balenciaga.html,"But by drawing on the architectural approach of Balenciaga the man, as well as the visual language he created -- the cocoon coat, the sac dress -- and combining them with the wardrobe elements of today, Mr. Gvasalia wrested the brand into 2016. Opera coats became puffa jackets and trenches, the collars spread to frame the clavicle, shoulders dropped and pulled into peaks at back. Button-down shirts, denim jackets and pea coats were cut on the slant and curved into the shape of a chrysalis, and suits in houndstooth and tweed had the hips triangulated out and up, like a false front, in an echo of the classic couture silhouette (shoulders slouched forward, stomach sucked in, bones sharp as steel).

If the latter pieces may be difficult to wear -- most women do not want their hips as a focal point -- and if stirrup pants (an unfortunate trend at the moment) and multi-print paisley and floral scarf dresses with matching jacquard boots were less successful, strapless evening sheaths in silver sequined flowers or embroidered velvet with a kick pleat over one knee had a refined rigor. As a whole, the collection was clear in antecedent and concise in effect.",Demna Gvasalia's debut collection was a highly controlled reboot of the brand.,f46d2416-cfe6-5ed1-b384-dd9382f29604,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/07/fashion/07BALENCIAGASUB-WEB/07BALENCIAGASUB-WEB-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=308fe4d235bcbb4dce6be68518c5b6eceead19773b58293cbc3a8b5381fd476d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Balenciaga, fall 2016.",f46d2416-cfe6-5ed1-b384-dd9382f29604,N24News/imgs/f46d2416-cfe6-5ed1-b384-dd9382f29604.jpg,19
Music,Mariah Carey and New Year's Eve: Is the Fantasy Over?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/arts/music/popcast-mariah-carey-new-years-eve.html,"Mr. Juzwiak argued that Ms. Carey likely made the decision to lip sync on New Year's Eve to avoid the kind of debacle she experienced at the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree lighting ceremony in 2014, when an unflattering isolated vocal track went viral. ""I think her voice is so temperamental, that if the environment is not perfect it throws another kink into this unpredictable instrument she has in 2016, going into 2017,"" he said, hypothesizing that she would rather ""be castigated for not singing than for singing"" poorly.

In the last 15 years, however, it's hard to talk about Ms. Carey only as a singer, as her artistic output has been overshadowed by her public missteps and dramas. Is ""Mariah's World"" another such mistake?

Mr. Arceneaux said yes, that there are major problems with ""Mariah's World,"" starting with the fact that the show is boring ""because it's not like the overly situated, dramatic things that make a reality show work, and it's not the realistic depiction that would actually make a docu-series work.""

Mr. Caramanica explained that the show is ""unsuccessful in telling you very much about Mariah; however, it is successful in repeating a bunch of publicly visible tropes about Mariah that we have all come to understand"" -- Mariah is almost always holding a wine glass; she is almost always prone; she is almost never simultaneously vertical and moving.

It is this ""aesthetic of relaxation,"" as Mr. Caramanica put it, that has defined late-period Mariah Carey. But when she challenged herself in the midpoint of her career, things were far more interesting. Mr. Juzwiak said that Ms. Carey entered her most significant artistic moment when Ms. Carey's voice began to change and she could no longer simply open her mouth and create magic: ""It was from 'Butterfly' and on, when she started doing different things with her voice, partially because she had to, that she became an artist.""",A panel discusses the singer's disastrous live moment and how her voice — and persona — has shifted over the course of her three-decade career on the Popcast.,3c76b155-2a6d-5a2b-8132-e08d86cc562e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/02/arts/02MARIAH/02MARIAH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=f0faebc114cb6af2409f0dd92e1c55f98315d12ae49eeaa7c3cb5c2a822e2dc1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mariah Carey during her performance on ABC's ""Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve With Ryan Seacrest"" in Times Square.",3c76b155-2a6d-5a2b-8132-e08d86cc562e,N24News/imgs/3c76b155-2a6d-5a2b-8132-e08d86cc562e.jpg,12
Dance,"Review: In Travelogues, Dance Postcards, Exactingly Handwritten",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/09/arts/dance/review-in-travelogues-dance-postcards-exactingly-handwritten.html,"Watching two people make tiny adjustments to their torsos for an hour might not sound like the most exciting night at the theater. But when those people are Colin Gee and Angie Smalis, it's uncannily absorbing. On Friday Mr. Gee, an American performer with a background in physical theater, and Ms. Smalis, a Greek dancer living in Limerick, Ireland, brought two works to Abrons Arts Center: ""Chaplet of Roses"" (2014) and ""They Go Out in Joy"" (2016). In doing what looked like very little, they accomplished a lot.

The evening was part of Travelogues, a series organized by the discerning dance producer Laurie Uprichard, who presents artists she's come to know through her international travels. I imagine each installment as a different form of correspondence: a bulky package, a sprawling letter. ""Chaplet"" and ""Joy,"" poetic in their efficiency, would be postcards, exactingly handwritten.

""Chaplet"" takes inspiration from ""Honor Making a Chaplet of Roses,"" a 15th-century Netherlandish tapestry whose image was projected on the back wall of the theater. Each of the tapestry's four characters appears suspended in a moment of polite gesture. The program notes translate the French inscriptions hovering beside them, gracious statements like, ""To please my friend better, I shall put on this pretty hat.""

Mr. Gee and Ms. Smalis -- who appear first in a video installation, then in the flesh -- embody something of that decorum in their own gesturing, an incremental shifting of the arms, shoulders, neck and face. They take turns standing onstage, next to an angular white sculpture that, like the moss-covered room they inhabit in the video, seems plucked from the world of the tapestry and made sleeker.","Colin Gee and Angie Smalis presented two works at Abrons Arts Center as part of Travelogues, a series organized by Laurie Uprichard.",9afec51d-3fbb-57f2-a06f-4847ffbf74d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/09/arts/09TRAVELOGUES/09TRAVELOGUES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b5355d3f093047b2a7ca0c4422c8de2f4950b932d1c8b4eb551ef8168d0412c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Colin Gee and Angie Smalis in ""Chaplet of Roses"" at Abrons Arts Center.",9afec51d-3fbb-57f2-a06f-4847ffbf74d2,N24News/imgs/9afec51d-3fbb-57f2-a06f-4847ffbf74d2.jpg,6
Global Business,Irish Officials Acknowledge Need for Aid,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/19/business/global/19euro.html,"Irish officials acknowledged for the first time on Thursday that Ireland was seeking aid from international lenders. Ireland had been reluctant to accept any bailout that came with strings attached. But on Thursday, Finance Minister Brian Lenihan told the Irish Parliament that it would be a ""very desirable outcome"" if a contingency capital fund could be established with the European Union, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. Patrick Honohan, the governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, said in an interview on the Irish state broadcaster RTE that ""we're talking about a very substantial loan for sure"" and that such a rescue would be ""in the tens of billions"" of euros. Ben May, an economist with Capital Economics in London, said the size of any bailout would depend on what the examiners found on the books of the Irish banks. He said that 60 billion euros ($82 billion) might suffice if it was to cover only the government's financing needs for the next few years but that more might be necessary to have firepower in reserve.

Additionally, he said, there is a concern that Irish banks might have trouble rolling over their debt after the European Central Bank begins to withdraw the extraordinary measures it used to combat the financial crisis. Also on Thursday, experts from the European Union, the I.M.F. and the European Central Bank arrived in Dublin to review the books of Irish lenders. ""I think we're moving toward the next stage,"" said Pier Carlo Padoan, chief economist of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. ""I'm encouraged by this decision; it's the beginning of the end, hopefully."" Concerns about Ireland's fiscal state have contributed to volatility on bond markets in recent days and helped to keep the euro under pressure. In Greece, meanwhile, where Europe's sovereign debt troubles first surfaced late last year, the Finance Ministry presented to Parliament a 2011 budget that paves the way for further deep cuts while also increasing sales taxes and redoubling efforts to crack down on tax evasion.

""These are not the desires and wishes of the Greek government,"" he said, ""but concrete measures that have been agreed"" with the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, which bailed out the country in May. The Finance Ministry pledged to reduce the 2011 budget deficit by an additional 5 billion euros ($6.8 billion), to 7.4 percent of gross domestic product. With these measures and other steps announced this year, the ministry said, 14 billion euros in budget savings and additional revenue could be realized next year. The Greek government had anticipated 1.5 billion euros in cuts for next year, but additional measures became necessary after Eurostat, the European Union's statistics agency, increased its estimate of Greece's 2009 budget deficit to 15.4 percent of G.D.P. from 13.6 percent previously. That meant more pain would be needed to put the budget on track for a deficit smaller than 3 percent of G.D.P. by 2014, as stipulated in the country's $140 billion rescue package. The bulk of the savings is to come from cutting costs at public enterprises and in sectors like military spending and health care. There were no further cuts to salaries and pensions, as officials, concerned over months of demonstrations, had promised.

Addressing his cabinet on Thursday morning, Prime Minister George Papandreou promised that the measures would not harm ""social cohesion."" While Greece's woes result largely from overspending and flawed record-keeping by previous governments, Ireland's woes have come mainly from the damage caused to overextended banks by the bursting of a real estate bubble. The authorities have had to nationalize a large portion of the Irish financial sector, and there are signs that the problems are getting worse, as more people are falling behind on their mortgage payments. The European Central Bank and the Irish central bank have had to step up their aid to Irish financial institutions as investor confidence has ebbed in recent months. Ireland's government bond yields have risen above 8 percent in recent weeks, a level that would make market refinancing painful. Caroline Atkinson, an I.M.F. spokeswoman in Washington, said in a briefing that the mission, led by the head of the organization's European department, Ajai Chopra, would begin work Friday. She declined to comment on how much money Ireland might receive. In Brussels, a spokesman for the European Union, Amadeu Altafaj, said that officials were ""focusing on the preparatory work in Dublin"" and that they would be ready if Ireland made a request for help. A spokesman for the European Central Bank declined to comment. In Madrid, the news about Ireland helped the Spanish Treasury sell 3.65 billion euros of 10-year and 30-year bonds. It had set a target of 3 billion euros to 4 billion euros. The sale attracted bids for 2.05 times the amount of bonds on offer at rates -- 4.615 percent for the 10-year and 5.488 percent for the 30-year -- that were slightly below those prevailing in the secondary market, but still well above the last time it sold debt at those maturities.","Irish officials on Thursday said for the first time that the country was seeking ""a very substantial loan"" to restore confidence in its long-term finances.",85dbcbf3-6e89-54fa-a876-537edb01f49b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/11/19/business/global/19euro-span/19euro-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=ee4a54ff9c793ef4109d60cd703a150cbe8aa346d31964c625830d45b9903a5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Brian Cowen, center, Ireland's prime minister, arrives at a Dublin convention center on Thursday.",85dbcbf3-6e89-54fa-a876-537edb01f49b,N24News/imgs/85dbcbf3-6e89-54fa-a876-537edb01f49b.jpg,24
Dance,"Up on the Roof, Flesh and Blood Dancers Move and Connect",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/arts/dance/arts-on-the-roof-chelsea-ainsworth.html,"Up on the Roof, Flesh and Blood Dancers Move and Connect

The dancer Chelsea Ainsworth stood before a small outdoor audience on Friday night, about to perform live for the first time in 25 weeks. Beneath her tap shoe-clad feet was a plywood stage that she and her husband, the visual artist Kyle Netzeband, had spent the past two days constructing by hand. The elevator in their East Village building was broken, so they had to lug materials up six flights of stairs. But that wasn't going to stop them: They were determined to bring dance to a live audience, on the rooftop where the finished stage now stood. ""It's time to put people in front of other people and really connect with one another, even if that means we're six feet apart and wearing masks,"" Ms. Ainsworth, 32, said in an interview earlier that evening. ""That's what we're good at."" In just a few minutes, she would change into costume and begin welcoming guests -- with an infrared thermometer, hand sanitizer, waiver forms and disinfected pens -- to the first dance event of Arts on the Roof, a new performance series affording some of the few opportunities to watch live dance in New York this summer and fall.

Four years ago, Ms. Ainsworth and Mr. Netzeband, together with the singer Adrian Rosas, founded Arts on Site, a multidisciplinary arts center on St. Marks Place (in the same building that housed the once bustling, now permanently shuttered school Yoga to the People). Largely advertised through word of mouth, the space became home to frequent performance parties, during which audience members would crowd into one of the three studios, drinks in hand, around a small clearing for performers. (Since March, the parties have been held online twice a month.)

When the coronavirus pandemic brought in-person performance to a halt in New York, Ms. Ainsworth and Mr. Netzeband, who live in the Arts on Site building, migrated upstate, where they run a more rural arts residency and retreat center near New Paltz. While quarantining there with a group of artists, Ms. Ainsworth, a Juilliard School graduate, created a dance film with her friend and collaborator Jessica Smith. But she felt eager to get back in front of a live audience. ""I'm not trained to show my work on a screen, to reach through the screen,"" she said. ""I'm trained to perform on a stage.""

In looking for ways to safely present live dance, Ms. Ainsworth and Mr. Netzeband requested rooftop access from their landlord, thinking he would say no. ""Normally it's like, 'Don't ever go on the roof,'"" Ms. Ainsworth said. But to her surprise, he agreed to their proposal for an outdoor performance series, provided they took certain precautions. They now have performances scheduled through September -- a mix of music and dance -- and permission to use the roof through November. For the inaugural dance shows, Ms. Ainsworth chose the Bang Group, a percussive ensemble led by David Parker (with whom she has danced since 2010), and Dual Rivet, her collaborative duo with Ms. Smith. Mr. Parker, 61, whose troupe appeared on Friday in a serendipitous break between rain showers, hadn't performed since January 2019 because of a knee replacement surgery, a hiatus that was supposed to have ended in April. He returned with a version of Merce Cunningham's ""50 Looks,"" a collection of poses, mostly for the upper body, to which he added an undercurrent of tapping feet.

""I realized I don't like to make decisions in some sort of abstract mental space,"" he said in an interview after the show, reflecting on ""Sparkle Again,"" a new piece he presented. ""I like to be working things out with the dancers."" In tap shoes, point shoes and bare feet, the work's cast of six follows a score by Pauline Kim Harris, written for shoes as rhythmic instruments. To create it, Mr. Parker met with the dancers in pairs, bringing the full group together for only two rehearsals. While Dual Rivet, on Sunday, offered works full of daring physical contact -- Ms. Smith and Ms. Ainsworth have been living together for five months, making them comfortable throwing, catching and climbing all over each other -- the members of Bang Group didn't touch. In their first moments onstage, several masked dancers stood silently in a circle and raised their arms, fingertips nearly meeting but not quite, an apt metaphor for the evening's reconvening.","A new performance series, Arts on the Roof, affords some of the few opportunities to watch live dance in New York this summer and fall.",338f7ea0-f0fa-5b2a-b163-c552970cfa64,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/01/arts/31ROOFTOP-DANCE-1/31ROOFTOP-DANCE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7cb49e38760f4329a2b6ec1e117d6d302dcae1cf088692569c665eedc9ccea9e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Nic Petry, Amber Sloan, Tommy Seibold and Chelsea Ainsworth of the Bang Group, performing on St. Marks Place in the East Village.",338f7ea0-f0fa-5b2a-b163-c552970cfa64,N24News/imgs/338f7ea0-f0fa-5b2a-b163-c552970cfa64.jpg,6
Automobiles,New Twists in Turning Hot Air Into Horsepower,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/automobiles/new-twists-in-turning-hot-air-into-horsepower.html,"In the half-century since it first appeared under the hood of production cars, the turbocharger has gone from a silver-bullet amplifier of horsepower to a device so widely used it seems on its way to becoming a fixture of every new model. In truth, the old dog has learned impressive new tricks, schooled in part by 2014 rules changes in Formula One racing that mandate smaller, less thirsty engines. In its new job description, the turbocharger is also a producer of electrical power for potent hybrid systems. The basics have not changed: Turbochargers still harvest the energy of the hot exhaust stream to pump air into the engine under pressure, increasing horsepower. For everyday use, this technology lets carmakers install downsized, highly efficient engines that can still produce the power required for highway driving. There are limits to how far the technology can be pushed. In Formula One racing, where turbocharged 1.6-liter V6 engines are used in place of the naturally aspirated 2.4-liter V8s of recent years, those limits also prove to be opportunities.

Because an engine can stand only so much pressure in its cylinders, and because a turbocharger should spin only so fast to assure reliability, engine designers add a valve that can open to dump some of the exhaust gases before they reach the turbine section of the turbocharger. This device, called a waste gate, is a necessary sacrifice, throwing away some of the combustion heat in trade for engine longevity. Grand prix cars in the Class of 2014 effectively double-dip by using the turbo shaft to also turn a motor-generator unit. The obvious benefit is generating electricity for the racecar's hybrid drive system -- good for a maximum of 160 horsepower under the new rules -- but there's more to it. The generator's output can be dialed up as engine speed rises, and the increased load limits the turbocharger pressure, a more efficient solution than using a waste gate. It gets better still: The unit can shift functions to become a motor, spinning the turbo in, say, a low-speed corner, to make sure boost pressure is instantly available when the driver floors the gas for the straightaway. The lag that plagued early turbo engines becomes a distant memory. All this, and the cars will complete each race consuming about one-third less fuel than they did last year. Automakers are not saying exactly when this technology may reach family cars, but the notion of racing improving the breed is not lost on participants like Mercedes-Benz, Renault, Ferrari (owned by Fiat) and, starting next season, Honda. Work is well underway to bring some of the principles to mass-production cars.

The V6 hybrid systems that power the Formula One field -- now called power units instead of engines -- may be on the leading edge of development, but the concept of driving a generator from a turbine is at least 130 years old. Turbo-generators were first used on a large scale in the 1880s to generate electricity from water power or steam, and they saw widespread use on railroad locomotives for heat and lighting. Formula One's path to greater efficiency employs a turbo-generator, known as the MGU-H or motor generator-heat, and a motor generator-kinetic, or MGK-K, which recovers kinetic energy from braking. Together, the systems deliver twice the power of the energy-recovery system called KERS that was used before 2014. This year's electric one-two punch brings the output of the V6 engines back to the level of last year's V8s, the teams say. The MGU-H is essentially an electric motor connected to the turbocharger's impeller shaft. As engine r.p.m. rises, and the hot exhaust gases spin the turbo up to its 100,000-r.p.m. peak, this motor can operate as a generator, converting heat energy from the exhaust gas into electricity. That electrical energy is then sent directly to the MGU-K to provide a burst of acceleration, according to demand, or to the lithium-ion battery pack for use later.

""The new Formula One energy-recovery systems go hand-in-hand with the direction of the automotive industry, particularly as it applies to the U.S. market,"" said Mark Christie, vice president for engine engineering at Ricardo, an engineering consultancy in suburban Detroit. Combining electric motors with turbochargers, superchargers or both, is a promising solution for road cars. As in the racecars, using an electric motor to drive a turbo or supercharger makes it possible to build pressure quickly so the engine can produce high levels of torque even at low r.p.m. Without electric muscle, devices that increase power by pumping air have inherent performance limitations, Mr. Christie explained, because of the wait for pressure to build as engine r.p.m. increases and brings the internal components up to speed.

One workaround is to use smaller turbos, which have less low-speed lag because they spool up more quickly, but they can quickly run out of breath. A supercharger driven by the engine is excellent for delivering air at low speeds, but its efficiency diminishes at high r.p.m. ""Traditional boosting devices present a balancing act -- how to ensure good low-to-high speed transient response while still being able to meet the power target,"" Mr. Christie said. Among the possible solutions are compound systems like the Volkswagen TwinCharger and Volvo Drive-E. Such arrangements use a conventional belt-driven supercharger at lower speeds and shift over to a turbo for higher r.p.m. operation. Ricardo chose to use a compound design in its recently unveiled HyBoost concept engine, but with an electric twist. HyBoost pairs an electrically driven supercharger with the conventional turbocharger. Accelerating from low speeds, the electric supercharger kicks in briefly to force additional air into the turbo's compressor section to eliminate lag. Electricity for the motor comes from a 12-volt starter-generator. Tailoring the turbo or supercharger to the electrical power on board the vehicle is one of the challenges, according to Dan Ouwenga, an engineering manager at Eaton, a supercharger manufacturer. ""The major limitation is related to how much electric energy is required versus how much air flow you need from the supercharger,"" he said. Eaton's solution is being evaluated by automakers. It uses a 12- or 48-volt electric-assist and a variable-speed supercharger that is pressed into service according to load and demand.","The turbocharger, the engine component that uses the exhaust's hot air to increase horsepower, is performing new tricks. It is now also producing electrical power for hybrid systems.",a8acb197-9543-5fe1-a74b-68846f265fa7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/11/automobiles/11TURBO/11TURBO-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=504&w=600&s=a5039bec49ddb8115c36d67dd79163e590d9a0dc13954c9d8e71ae0d287f7acc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eaton's supercharger can be driven by an electric motor.,a8acb197-9543-5fe1-a74b-68846f265fa7,N24News/imgs/a8acb197-9543-5fe1-a74b-68846f265fa7.jpg,23
Travel,Mountains Aren't Just for Skiing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/08/travel/snow-hiking-snowshoeing.html,"Snow hiking is growing in popularity as a wintertime sport globally. Alta Badia ski resort, in Italy's Dolomites region, saw 50,000 snow hikers in the winter of 2017- 18, compared with 30,000 the previous winter, according to the local tourist board. Companies that offer snow hiking excursions also report a rise in business: Discover Banff Tours, which runs snow hiking trips in Banff National Park, had more than 10,000 participants last winter, compared with 6,000 in the winter of 2015-16, said its founder, Jonathan Welsh. Here's what you need to know to about snow hiking: Molly Bayer, a senior instructor with the outdoor gear brand REI, said that snow hiking essentially means trekking through snow. Hikers wear snowshoes only when there's enough snow for their feet to sink in. ""Ideally, you want a foot of snow, but as little as six inches will do,"" she said. If they're not using snowshoes, hikers typically wear waterproof ankle-height boots with micro spikes, which protect against slippage. And, while winter sports like skiing and snowboarding require some technical skills and lessons, snow hiking doesn't. ""The nice thing about the sport is that you can go off on an excursion without any previous experience,"" Ms. Bayer said. Compared with snowboarding or skiing, where the cost of equipment can run into the thousands, snow hiking is affordable, Ms. Bayer said. You can buy good quality hiking boots for $150.

Ms. Bayer recommended that hikers use trekking poles to help with balance, and that they dress in layers. ""Since your body heats up when you're hiking, you want to wear breathable, synthetic fabrics that you can take off as you get warm,"" she said. Other essentials include a hat, gloves, gaiters -- which protect the lower legs and feet from getting wet -- water and snacks, especially on hikes of three hours or more. Chocolate bars, energy bars and nuts are all smart choices for refueling and are easy to pack, too. If you are visiting popular areas for snow sports like Vail, Colo., Jackson Hole, Wyo., or the Swiss Alps, you can likely rent equipment such as gaiters and poles from local sporting goods stores. Wearing sunscreen and sunglasses is also key, Ms. Bayer said, because sun reflects off snow, and the rays can be stronger than they are on a sunny summer day.

Internationally, in Mont-Tremblant, Canada, the Ski de fond Mont-Tremblant resort has a network of 20 trails for winter hiking. The Parc National du Mont-Tremblant also offers winter hiking, and there's a new trail at the Domaine Saint-Bernard park that has 13 miles of winter hiking. It runs through the forest, past lakes and along the Diable River, and hikers can expect to see a variety of bird species and deer along the way. Banff National Park, which encompasses more than 2,500 square miles, has a few hundred hiking trails, according to Mr. Welsh of Discover Banff Tours. The Swiss and French Alps are replete with snow hiking trails, as are the Dolomites. Diego Zanesco, a hiking guide in that region, said there are ""an innumerable amount of marked snow hiking trails."" Since the hiking is dependent on snow, season varies by destination: In the Dolomites, for example, it usually runs from early December to early April. Hikers can embark on treks using a map and GPS, but local tour companies in ski resort towns often offer half- and full-day group and private excursions. Mr. Welsh's company, for one, runs half-day guided snow hiking trips in Banff National Park for between $40 and $100 a person. Mr. Zanesco offers full-day hiking excursions in the Dolomites at a starting cost of $700 for two people, and several adventure companies sell multiday snow hiking trips. REI Adventures, for example, has a four-day snowshoeing trip in the White Mountains, in New Hampshire, at a starting price of $749 a person. In addition, some hotels in snow hiking regions, such as Rosa Alpina in the Dolomites, organize excursions for their guests to nearby mountains. The hotel's owner, Hugo Pizzinini, who is an avid snow hiker, also takes guests out on hourlong free hikes in the nearby hills of San Cassiano village. ""They're a way for newcomers to get introduced to the sport,"" he said. When it comes to safety, Ms. Bayer said that hikers need to be concerned about avalanches if they're on steep terrain. Since the risk of these can change daily, they should check in with the local ski center about that day's conditions before setting off. In addition, since some trails aren't marked, it's easy to get lost. Hikers should always head out with at least one other person and a map, compass and GPS. And this is fun? ""You're trekking up and down hills, and all of a sudden, you stumble across an open valley with snow-covered mountains and frozen lakes,"" Mr. Zanesco said of snow hiking in the Dolomites. In addition, many of the mountains in the region are home to family-owned restaurants and bars, and hikers often trek from spot to spot and enjoy food and drinks along the way.

Technology,"Facebook Says Russian Firms 'Scraped' Data, Some for Facial Recognition",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/technology/facebook-russian-scraping-data.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- On the same day Facebook announced that it had carried out its biggest purge yet of American accounts peddling disinformation, the company quietly made another revelation: It had removed 66 accounts, pages and apps linked to Russian firms that build facial recognition software for the Russian government. Facebook said Thursday that it had removed any accounts associated with SocialDataHub and its sister firm, Fubutech, because the companies violated its policies by scraping data from the social network. ""Facebook has reason to believe your work for the government has included matching photos from individuals' personal social media accounts in order to identify them,"" the company said in a cease-and-desist letter to SocialDataHub that was dated Tuesday and viewed by The New York Times. Facebook gave the companies until Friday to detail what data they had taken and then delete it all. The case illustrates a new reality for Facebook. SocialDataHub and Fubutech have been around for at least four years, relying in part on Facebook data to build products that might alarm some civil-liberty advocates.

As Facebook is taking a closer look at its own products amid increasing scrutiny and public outcry, it is finding more examples of companies that have been exploiting its global social network for questionable ends. SocialDataHub and Fubutech also present another challenge because, Facebook said, at least some of their data collection occurred through web scraping. Scraping is a rudimentary technique in which computer programmers can pull information off a website. It is difficult to detect and prevent, Facebook said. Scraping can pull any data that's left public on a Facebook profile -- and, theoretically, more private data about the user's Facebook friends. Artur Khachuyan, the 26-year-old chief executive of SocialDataHub and Fubutech, said in an interview Friday that Facebook had deleted his companies' accounts unfairly. Fubutech does build facial-recognition software for the Russian government and uses Facebook data, but it scrapes Google search results for that information -- not Facebook, he said. And SocialDataHub's main product -- a system that assigns scores to Russian citizens based on their social-media profiles for insurers and banks -- required permission from the users it rates, he said.

Mr. Khachuyan said that he taught Russian journalism students how to scrape the web and that two of them had scraped Facebook for the public profiles of their classmates. He believes Facebook mistook the students' activity for his companies' work. ""Maybe it's a reason to deactivate our accounts,"" Mr. Khachuyan said. ""But I don't know why Facebook deletes Instagram account of my dog."" That account, for ""Mars the Blue Corgi,"" had 176 followers. Katy Dormer, a Facebook spokeswoman, rejected Mr. Khachuyan's claim that Facebook had conflated his students' activity with the actions of his companies. ""We don't take these actions lightly,"" she said. ""The fact we took the action and sent the letter means we saw enough evidence."" Facebook's removal of SocialDataHub and Fubutech reflects a larger problem for the social media company as it evaluates its relationship with third-party apps that have access to people's Facebook data. In the wake of reporting by The New York Times and others that the political firm Cambridge Analytica harvested the data of more than 87 million Facebook users through a third-party app, Facebook announced that it was reviewing its data-sharing policy with apps. After an audit, the company said it was suspending 200 apps. Some have since had their access to Facebook restored. Mr. Khachuyan said the letter from Facebook had surprised him, particularly because his companies have been operating the same way for years.

""All in Russia know about us for minimum four years,"" he said. ""I don't know why that Facebook sent that only now."" He said Fubutech scraped data from the web, particularly Google search and the Russian search engine Yandex, to build a database of Russian citizens and their images that the government can use for facial recognition. ""We don't know exactly what they do with it,"" he said. ""Maybe government clients connect our software to C.C. cameras,"" Mr. Khachuyan said, referring to closed-circuit cameras. ""Maybe they connect it to social profiles."" Mr. Khachuyan compared Fubutech to Palantir, the Palo Alto, Calif., tech company that does data analysis for the American government. At one point in a 30-minute phone interview, he said the Russian Defense Ministry was a client, but later said he could not name Fubutech's government clients. His other firm, SocialDataHub, works with insurers and banks to evaluate potential customers. Between 30,000 and 50,000 Russian citizens have given SocialDataHub permission to analyze their Facebook profiles to assign a score between zero and 10, which insurers and banks use to help set rates or approve credit cards. ""If you're a bad client, you have zero to three,"" Mr. Khachuyan said. He said his companies, which share 52 employees in Moscow, complied with Facebook policies; they use Facebook data only when it is public and available on Google search, or if the user has granted them permission. He said the techniques were also legal in Russia. ""It's a trick in our federal law to use that data, but that works only with Russian citizens,"" Mr. Khachuyan said. At the top of the SocialDataHub's website, there is a single line: ""We know everything about everybody.""","On the same day the company announced it had purged domestic sources of disinformation, it said it had blocked two companies, one of them with Russian government clients.",34cb97bc-c31c-540e-a649-276c1ef79118,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/13/business/13brussia/merlin_145143849_296d50e2-8e00-4177-b9ca-f5c3c839ed62-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e432f63775cd8bab69951d35577bf2e80587b2c83f95767e149aeeb5e305fa81&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Facebook removed accounts associated with SocialDataHub and its sister firm, Fubutech.

Science,On the Hunt for Tasty Morel Mushrooms,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/15/science/on-the-hunt-for-tasty-morel-mushrooms.html,"Murray Davidson, who is a third generation morel hunter, found this morel under a dying elm tree on April 4 and posted it on Instagram @murraydphotography

 They look like sponges or Dali-esque brains, but for those who've ever fried them up or experienced them in pasta sauce, their unique earthly flavor can't be topped. Over the past few weeks, mushroom hunters from Georgia to Ohio have reported morel sightings on Facebook, Instagram and YouTube. And as spring sweeps other parts of the country, more reports can be expected each day, as you can see in these maps, tracking morel sightings across the country.

Chris Matherly, the founder of the Morel Mushroom Hunting Club, predicts the best places for booty this week are the southern coastal region of Oregon; Missouri; Kansas; southeastern Nebraska; the southern halves of Indiana, Illinois and Ohio; and Appalachian states such as Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia. In a couple weeks, New England and the northern Midwest should be popping, he added.

Morels emerge in moist environments with air temperatures in the 60s and 70s and soil temperatures in the 50s, and stick around for about three weeks after that. Although it may seem like the mushroom pops up overnight it actually grows over a period of 10 to 20 days, as you can see in this YouTube video of the morel life cycle shot by Mr. Matherly. The 19 known species of morels in North America -- mainly black, gray and yellow -- tend to pop up in that order as the temperatures get warmer, according to Dr. Tom Volk, a professor of biology at the University of Wisconsin-La Crosse. To find them, he says, look on south facing slopes first because they warm up faster. Though typically one to five inches in height, last year a man in Kansas found a morel that was a foot tall.

Unlike most flowers and plants, which spring up under favorable environmental conditions, the morel fungus (which actually lives underground) fruits, or sends up its spore-filled caps, when times get hard. That's why you'll find morels after forest fires or near dying trees -- Conifers out West, Poplars and Ash down South and Elms in the Midwest. Morel aficionados recommend collecting the mushrooms in some sort of bag or basket with holes in it, so that spores can stay behind in the wild and enable reproduction crucial to future bounties. ""Go out with a mesh bag and be Johny Appleseed when you're in the woods,"" said Mr. Matherly. For those who want to take the hunt to the next level, a number of upcoming festivals include competitions. (These include the Mesick Lion's 57th Annual Mushroom Festival in Mesick, Mich., from May 6 to 8, the National Morel Mushroom Festival from May 11 to 15 in Boyne City, Mich., and the Midwest Morel Fest in Ottawa, Illi., on May 7, where the finder of the biggest morel wins $500.) Fun morel hunting fact: Don't say the ""m"" word while hunting; some think the morels may hear you and pop back under the ground.","Fungiphiles rejoice.

Music,"Review: 50 Violins, 50 Computer Chips, a Secular Prayer",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/arts/music/tristan-perich-drift-multiply.html,"Tristan Perich's ""Drift Multiply,"" performed on Wednesday at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, is scored for 50 violins and 50 one-bit computer chips connected to speakers.

It's not unusual for contemporary music to appear in New York's churches, where chamber groups and orchestras often present very secular programs of avant-garde composition. But it was still odd to see the logo of the Red Bull Music Festival inside the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine on Wednesday. The Rev. Clifton Daniel III, interim dean of the cathedral, said a kind of benediction over the juxtaposition of religion and radical sounds, inviting audience members to view the building as a place for prayer, ""however you define that."" Then Red Bull's roving annual festival proceeded to make the space feel like a natural extension of its characteristic experimentation, courtesy of sets by Lesley Flanigan and Tristan Perich. In the hands of these composers, who are fascinated by electronics (and who happen to be married), the cathedral's resonant depths were put to uses that often seemed suitably profound. Ms. Flanigan went first, with a gripping 40-minute work called ""Subtonalities,"" for sine-wave oscillators and her own voice. After beginning by singing some straight-tone notes, she ventured a few short, simple melodies.

Those wordless phrases were unassuming, but any sense they were merely casual was soon swept away by her electronic manipulations. While she layered pitches from her vocalizations into gleaming choral refrains, deeper bass tones created various forms of tension -- sometimes shaping clear pools of harmony, at other points sounding fuzzed-out or approaching states of feedback noise.

Ms. Flanigan rode these edges of discomfort with poise. Just when I thought I knew how she might recombine a few of the elements previously established in the piece, she would introduce a new chord -- or a surprising sound-mixing switch that gracefully suggested an appreciation of vintage turntablism. After intermission, a group of 50 violinists (led by the conductor Doug Perkins) convened for Mr. Perich's ""Drift Multiply,"" playing alongside 50 one-bit computer chips hooked up to speakers. This particular blend of the acoustic and the harshly digital has been a cornerstone of his work in recent years, on albums like ""Active Field"" and ""Surface Image."" It's natural to wonder how long he can keep churning out music in this mold, though this new piece showed him still wringing variations from the concept.

While each violinist -- and each one-bit chip -- had an individual line of melody to follow, the results were rarely as chaotic as a 100-part score might suggest. Indeed, in the early going ""Drift Multiply"" was some of Mr. Perich's most sublimely settled music yet, as minor-third dyads bloomed throughout the violins. The extended scope of the piece allowed him to chart lengthy routes to more complex material. After nearly half an hour, a chattering and dryly abrasive passage of electronic polyphony overtook the violins, eventually vibrating throughout the cavernous room: Fans of Mr. Perich's more intense sonic explorations might have felt like raising devil-horn hands at this decidedly metal moment -- with apologies to the cathedral. Yet no single extreme was pursued for long. Mr. Perich's interest in pulses and repetition comes from the early Minimalists -- but he has also absorbed their advice about the need for change. His attractive melodic fragments were difficult to hold in mind, since a listener's attention was constantly drawn to some competing figure. (At one point, an intercessional stab of electronics made me think that the entire audience's collection of iPhones had just received an emergency flood watch warning. Then it was gone.) While some took the opportunity to recline on the floor at the rear of the cathedral, to me the work never felt overly indebted to the blissed-out happenings of past decades. There was a mindfulness in this music -- not least in its quiet, unpredictable final progressions -- that consistently encouraged a state of active attention. It could have served a prayerful intention, if you wanted. Or you might have merely deemed it ecstatically, confidently alive.","Tristan Perich's sublime ""Drift Multiply"" shared the program at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine with Lesley Flanigan's ""Subtonalities.""",9ec78365-7218-546a-9ca6-a9da2c1e78f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/12/arts/12perich1/12perich1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=54bb746e71554e1588f65b6605a08112e42691c4861b5a82192803daf7b345bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tristan Perich&rsquo;s &ldquo;Drift Multiply,&rdquo; performed on Wednesday at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, is scored for 50 violins and 50 one-bit computer chips connected to speakers.",9ec78365-7218-546a-9ca6-a9da2c1e78f7,N24News/imgs/9ec78365-7218-546a-9ca6-a9da2c1e78f7.jpg,12
Music,A Soprano Survived a Vocal Crisis. The Met Found Its Brünnhilde.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/music/christine-goerke-soprano-wagner-ring-met-opera.html,"Christine Goerke at the Metropolitan Opera, where she sings Brunnhilde in Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle this spring.Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York Times



Christine Goerke, who is getting ready to join the long, storied line of Brunnhildes who have scaled Wagner's epic ""Ring"" cycle at the Metropolitan Opera, walked into Valhalla. No, not the majestic castle in the sky where her character, a Valkyrie warrior, brings slain heroes to serve her father, the mighty god Wotan. This Valhalla is a bar in Hell's Kitchen, a few blocks south of the Met, that bills itself as ""craft beer heaven."" ""I'm going to be a total jerk and have sparkling water,"" Ms. Goerke said at the bar, bowing to the coming marathon she faces in rehearsing and performing one of the toughest assignments in opera: her first complete ""Ring"" cycle, a sprawling 17-hour, four-opera saga of gods, dwarfs, giants and humans that she will star in between March 25 and May 11. ""But on May 12, I'm getting so drunk -- having all of the things."" It's a triumphant return to the opera house where Ms. Goerke trained as an insecure young artist in the 1990s. When she sang the small role of the Third Norn in ""Gotterdammerung,"" the fourth ""Ring"" opera, at the Met in 2000, she recalled, she would linger in the wings after her exit, watching the soprano singing Brunnhilde and thinking: ""Some day.""

""I think if you talk to anyone who's ever been a young artist in any house, it's always hard to come back and feel like a grown-up,"" Ms. Goerke said over her seltzer, remembering her young fears that she had not trained at the fanciest conservatories. ""I'm going to be 50, and I still feel like I'm 24."" ""But then you wander out to get a cup of coffee,"" she added, ""and you go across the street and there's a gigantic banner of yourself hanging on the side of the building -- which is beyond freaky."" Raised on Long Island, Ms. Goerke overcame her self-doubt to achieve success singing Mozart and Handel. Then catastrophe struck, in the form of a vocal crisis that nearly led her to quit opera. The problem, she found, was that her voice had grown too large for the roles she had been singing. She slowed down, retrained, and re-emerged, against the odds, as one of the leading dramatic sopranos in the world -- singing the heavy, nearly impossible-to-cast Wagnerian parts that she sometimes calls ""the 'spear and magic helmet' ladies,"" borrowing a line from the classic Bugs Bunny ""Kill the Wabbit"" parody.

Great Wagnerian sopranos are few and far between. Only one or two may emerge each generation with the power to be heard over some of the largest orchestras in all of opera without amplification, the precision to hit the high notes, and the artistry to break your heart. Ms. Goerke's success has been big news in the opera world, which is usually grateful for singers who can merely get through such parts relatively unscathed. And the Met ""Ring"" will be her biggest test yet. A larger-than-life personality with an irreverent streak -- imagine a cross between the great Swedish soprano Birgit Nilsson and Tina Fey -- she works hard and plays hard. While singing Brunnhilde last fall in Wagner's ""Siegfried"" at the Lyric Opera of Chicago, she and her Wotan, the bass-baritone Eric Owens, dressed up for Halloween as the animated superheros of ""The Incredibles.""

Some find it all a bit much. Others see it as a welcome antidote to opera's reputation for being elitist or snobby. ""I got into it with one of my colleagues a little bit, who was like, 'I feel like that's dumbing down things,'"" Ms. Goerke recalled. ""And I was like, 'I think it's fun.' And you know, it's not 1945, and things are different. People are always trying to talk about how to make opera more accessible. And I feel like the way to make it more accessible is to let folks know that it is accessible. It's not the thing that's stuffy, and for your grandparents.""

In person Ms. Goerke comes across as warm, funny and unpretentious -- the kind of diva you would like to get a beer, or sparkling water, with. And her unusually frank, often humorous social media accounts offer glimpses into what it's really like to be a 21st century opera star, which rarely bears much resemblance to popular pearls-and-furs prima donna stereotypes. Sometimes she shares her hacks for life on the road: She travels with her own spices to cut the expense of stocking a kitchen in each new city, and always packs a supply of stick-on hooks that allow her to rig curtains in rental apartments lacking blinds.

Brunnhilde is, in many ways, the hero of the ""Ring."" She defies the gods, falls in love with a heroic dragon-slayer and ultimately redeems the world through love before immolating herself. She appears in the final three of the cycle's four operas -- ""Die Walkure,"" ""Siegfried"" and ""Gotterdammerung"" -- and although Ms. Goerke has sung them each individually, this will be her first time performing them together in complete cycles, as Wagner intended. ""Ring"" cycles tend to draw Wagner fans from around the world, who can be as obsessive as Deadheads. This one will likely draw plenty of critics, who will be measuring her performance against the legendary Brunnhildes of the past, as well as some of her old friends from Patchogue-Medford High School on Long Island, where she once played in the band. All will be listening to hear whether Ms. Goerke lives up to her potential. She has surpassed expectations before. Patrick Summers, the artistic and music director of the Houston Grand Opera, conducted some of her earliest successes in Mozart and Handel. He remembered how devastated she was 15 years ago when those of kinds of roles were no longer comfortable for her. Her decision to reinvent herself was initially met with skepticism: When Mr. Summers cast her in Wagner's ""Lohengrin"" in Houston in 2009, he recalled, ""I had some of my colleagues tell me it was crazy to think such a thing."" But she triumphed, and he invited her back -- as Brunnhilde. ""She so connects to Brunnhilde, because she's a warrior herself,"" he said. Andris Nelsons, who conducted her in breakout performances of Strauss's ""Elektra"" at the Royal Opera House in London and with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (including at a searing Carnegie Hall performance in 2015), said he was awed by her ability to sing with power, but also with chamber-music-like intimacy -- and by her dramatic intensity.

""She lives on the stage, she loves on the stage, she hates on the stage,"" he said. ""It's breathtaking."" Mr. Neef said that Ms. Goerke was the only singer he had ever cast based on a video -- after watching a recording of an ""Elektra"" she had sung in Madrid in 2011. ""I went into my artistic administrator's office, and said you have to hire Christine for all three Brunnhildes right away,"" he said. ""Because if we wait, other people will figure it out, too."" They did. When Peter Gelb, the Met's general manager, heard the frenzied ovation after Ms. Goerke sang the Dyer's Wife in Strauss's ""Die Frau Ohne Schatten"" staged there in 2013, he immediately offered her this season's ""Ring."" It is as formidable an assignment as opera offers, yet as she unwound at Valhalla -- the bar, that is -- she was already thinking about what comes next: She is studying the score of Wagner's ""Tristan und Isolde,"" perhaps the only work that matches the ""Ring"" in its demands on its lead singers. ""That's my Everest at the moment,"" Ms. Goerke said.","Christine Goerke nearly quit opera before becoming one of the world's top dramatic voices. Now she faces her biggest test: Wagner's ""Ring"" cycle.",2c2919cd-e309-53a1-8491-61e01b6398df,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/17/arts/17GOERKEa/17GOERKEa-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=8548ed93d316d973e28048bb2cc462cd05df70d416bc55de0a595d122cfb35a2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Christine Goerke at the Metropolitan Opera, where she sings Br&uuml;nnhilde in Wagner&rsquo;s &ldquo;Ring&rdquo; cycle this spring.",2c2919cd-e309-53a1-8491-61e01b6398df,N24News/imgs/2c2919cd-e309-53a1-8491-61e01b6398df.jpg,12
Science,Watch the Moon Landing of China's Chang'e-5 Spacecraft,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/02/science/china-moon-landing.html,"China released video footage on Wednesday showing the arrival of its Chang'e-5 robotic spacecraft on the moon's surface. Within hours of arriving it began collecting lunar rocks and soil.





China released video footage on Wednesday showing the arrival of its Chang'e-5 robotic spacecraft on the moon's surface. Racing across a landscape sprinkled with craters on Tuesday, the camera pauses momentarily before a breathtaking fall begins. An instant later, a splash of moon dust and a shadow of the lander signaled that the probe's touchdown was a success. ""Very precise and exciting landing, right in the middle of the most important geologic unit in the broader Chang'e 5 candidate landing region,"" James W. Head III, a geological science professor at Brown University, said in an email. Dr. Head collaborated with Chinese scientists on where the mission should go to gather rocks and soil to bring back to Earth

The lander set down, as planned, in a region of the moon known as Mons Rumker, at 10:11 a.m. Eastern time on Tuesday. The spacecraft is in the middle of a basalt lava plain that is about two billion years younger than the parts of the moon explored more than four decades ago by NASA's Apollo astronauts and the Soviet Union's robotic Luna landers.

Images from Chang'e-5 show a desolate landscape with gentle rolling hills. A dearth of nearby craters points to the area's youth. Scientists are curious how this region remained molten far longer than the rest of the moon. Examination of these rocks in laboratories on Earth will also pin down their exact age, and that will calibrate a method that planetary scientists use to determine the ages of the surfaces of planets, moons and other bodies throughout the solar system. The lander has already completed its drilling and stored the sample. It continues scooping up some soil around the spacecraft. Once that is complete, the top half of the lander will blast back off into space as soon as Thursday. That will be the start of a complex sequence to return the rocks to Earth.","Within hours of arriving, it started drilling and scooping lunar rocks and soil to bring back to Earth.",f7fc5179-88f5-5c01-ae8e-10567f22c300,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/02/science/02CHINAMOON/02CHINAMOON-facebookJumbo.jpg,A panoramic image showed a leg of the Chang'e-5 lander and the location where it set down.,f7fc5179-88f5-5c01-ae8e-10567f22c300,N24News/imgs/f7fc5179-88f5-5c01-ae8e-10567f22c300.jpg,2
Sports,"Coco Gauff Vaults From Obscurity to Stardom, but Result Is the Same",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/sports/tennis/coco-gauff-venus-williams.html,"Coco Gauff on Monday after she defeated Venus Williams in the first round of the Australian Open.





Coco Gauff Vaults From Obscurity to Stardom, but Result Is the Same

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Coco Gauff was a qualifier and Grand Slam rookie when she played Venus Williams for the first time. That was at Wimbledon in July, and Gauff's first-round, 6-4, 6-4 victory over the five-time Wimbledon champion sent shock waves through the All England Club and beyond, far beyond. Much has changed in six months. Gauff is still 15 years old, still a fighter on the court and still a charmer in the interview room. But with a ranking of 67 and a tour singles title in her possession, Gauff no longer has to bother with the qualifying tournament at Grand Slam events. She no longer needs a wild card to get into a major, like the one she received into last year's United States Open.

In a floodlit hurry, she has become part of the tennis landscape, and it was striking to watch her first-round rematch with Williams on Monday at the Australian Open and realize as the crowd chanted ""Coco"" that it might now be a bigger surprise if Gauff lost than if she won. ""We almost had the impression that it was Coco who was the favorite,"" said Jean-Christophe Faurel, one of her coaches. Gauff, to her credit, found a way to shrug off her new status and navigate the shoals, winning this duel, 7-6 (5), 6-3, by showing plenty of power and finesse when it mattered most against Williams, who, at 39, is closer to triple Gauff's age than double and had not played an official match since October. ""I definitely was more confident this time,"" Gauff said. ""I think I was used to playing on big courts, so I guess the size of the crowd didn't startle me as much as last time."" The Wimbledon match was played on No. 1 Court, the second-biggest arena at the All England Club with a capacity of about 11,000. The rematch on Monday was in Margaret Court Arena, the third-biggest show court at Melbourne Park, with a capacity of 7,500.

""My mission is to be the greatest,"" she said. ""That's my goal, to win as many Grand Slams as possible. But for today, my mission was to win. I didn't want to let the nerves come to me."" Mission accomplished, even if the nerves were clearly there when she failed to convert her first three set points in the opening set and double faulted to lose her serve at 5-4. But again, to her credit, she did not allow Williams to do what she has been doing for more than 20 years: dictate the terms of a rally with her huge groundstrokes and aggressive mind-set. Instead, Gauff dug through her tennis toolbox, which is already precociously complete, and came up with bold strokes and abrupt changes of pace, including drop shots and forays to the net. It was not always clean, not always effective, but the intent to pose an all-court threat was evident, which should pay dividends down the track.

""You have to learn to go forward to the net,"" said Corey Gauff, her father and head coach. ""The game is changing. If you want to have a long career, you can't be out there playing 30 balls per point."" Part of what makes Gauff so promising is that she can play the game in all manner of ways. She has the foot speed to grind from the baseline and extend rallies when necessary, but she also has the power with her serve -- and second serve -- to end points in a hurry. The buzz surrounding Gauff is a brand of mania to which Williams can certainly relate, considering the buzz she herself generated as a teenager in the 1990s. ""She clearly wants it, works very hard, is extremely mature for her age,"" Williams said of Gauff. ""I think the sky's the limit for her."" Williams said the same about Gauff at Wimbledon, and it was quite a surprise that they got met again so soon in an opening round. ""When we saw the draw, we went, 'There's no way that's random,'"" Corey Gauff said with a chuckle. The Gauff family has seen a lot of the Williams sisters of late. Serena Williams's coach, Patrick Mouratoglou, has been one of Gauff's longtime benefactors, and he organized a preseason training camp in December in Boca Raton, Fla., that included Gauff and Serena Williams, as well as Chris Eubanks and Marius Copil.

The weather could have been better in Boca Raton, and Serena Williams and Gauff often practiced separately with their teams. But there was plenty of bonding off court with dinners, karaoke sessions and a dance performance that was filmed and posted online. ""My highlight definitely,"" Coco Gauff said. ""Serena and I, we didn't pick up the choreography as fast as everyone else. In the end, we did well. She pulled a split. That was really cool."" Gauff might not play like a 15-year-old, but she can sound like one. She is into TikTok, the app that has become a global addiction. ""I procrastinate a lot on that app; I have to do homework,"" she said. ""I mean, everyone thinks I'm so serious because of my on-court. Really I'm not. I don't take life too seriously. I mean, I just like to have fun. Same with my dad. I know my dad seems like this big, intimidating guy, but he's really more the jokester."" But beating Venus Williams -- even a rusty Venus Williams -- continues to require serious talent and a serious sense of purpose. Wiliams, ranked 55th, has lost a step but not her love of the battle, and though Gauff leads the head-to-head by 2-0, that is also a virtue of Williams's staying power.

""She's showing my daughter you can play tennis as long as you want at a high level,"" Corey Gauff said. ""I'm glad my daughter won, but I hate to see Venus out in the first round. I wish they didn't have to play each other."" In other action: Sloane Stephens, the 24th seed, was ousted by unseeded Zhang Shuai, 2-6, 7-5, 6-2. Zhang also defeated Stephens in the first round of the 2018 Australian Open, four months after Stephens won the U.S. Open.","Sudden fame and high expectations have not slowed Gauff, who again defeated Venus Williams in the first round of a Grand Slam, about six months after doing it as a little-known qualifier.",51ea6390-6e35-50fa-b7e5-7662dc3c3228,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/world/20tennis-coco-venus02/merlin_167424939_da057a2f-f41b-4739-8bbe-d2b337019178-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d1e1f6741a69b286f13f67ac61437b588b75b089f39b98932fc3439158744ee7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gauff won, 7-6 (5), 6-3, by showing plenty of power and finesse.",51ea6390-6e35-50fa-b7e5-7662dc3c3228,N24News/imgs/51ea6390-6e35-50fa-b7e5-7662dc3c3228.jpg,9
Travel,36 Hours in Auckland,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/travel/36-hours-in-auckland.html,"The construction cranes that pierce the Auckland skyline are a visual indication of the growth New Zealand's largest city is experiencing. Close to one-third of New Zealand's estimated 4.5 million population lives in Auckland, a geographically blessed -- and traffic-cursed -- city spread over at least 50 volcanic cones on a North Island neck of land between two large harbors. The emerging Wynyard Quarter on the western waterfront is home to a new theater, a park where movies are projected onto the side of a former cement silo in the Southern Hemisphere summer and several restaurants. Auckland's personality, like New Zealand's, is laid-back and outdoorsy, but its sophistication shines in its expanding art scene, thriving fashion industry and a new generation of chefs embracing native ingredients.

Through its ground-level galleries devoted to contemporary New Zealand art, the Auckland Art Gallery (free for New Zealanders; 20 New Zealand dollars, or about $14.50 for international adults) is a great place to get a feel for national concerns and the influence of the indigenous Maori culture on visual art. The lace-like paper panels, entitled ""Milk and Honey,"" commissioned from the artist Lonnie Hutchinson that explore the exploitation of indigenous women are particularly powerful. Wander upstairs under space-potato sculptures by the artist Judy Darragh suspended in the atrium, part of a 2011 expansion, to an older wing of the building where a series of portraits by the painter Charles F. Goldie, done in the early 20th century, lovingly capture detailed images of his tattooed Maori subjects. Take a walk on Auckland's counter cultural side along Karangahape Road, known locally as K Road. Near the city's oldest cemetery, a string of music shops, cheap clothing dealers and craft stores mingle with bars and restaurants over several blocks. Wander into the vintage shopping mall St. Kevins Arcade to browse the retro wares, from the secondhand bookstore Green Dolphin, focusing on children's books, to vintage-inspired dresses from Rita Sue Clothing.

Before opening their innovative restaurant Pasture in 2016, the chef Ed Verner and his wife Laura Verner, who manages the wine list, spent a year gathering elderflowers to steep in vermouth, pickling spruce leaves, brining wild fennel and aging butter so it tastes like Camembert. Now just 20 diners at a time can try that butter with their house-made sourdough, a side dish to a set menu of five to six small, seasonal and astonishing courses (160 to 180 dollars). Mr. Verner makes ample use of an open fire for torching leeks and smoking everything from quince to duck. Menus highlight the bounty of New Zealand with an emphasis on vegetables. The drinks pairings -- alcoholic (85 dollars) and nonalcoholic (75 dollars) -- are as original as the food , and might include an intentionally oxidized rose . You'll make no decisions about what to eat or drink, but you'll be in hands so passionate that if you express a love of the eel broth, the couple might offer to package up an extra serving to take home.

New Zealand is known for its Great Walks, nine stunning long-distance trails that span the geographic breadth of the country from coastlines to mountains. These lie far beyond the city, but the new Coast to Coast Walkway in Auckland takes a similarly comprehensive approach to trekking across town. The roughly 10-mile route goes from the Waitemata Harbor downtown south across the isthmus to Manukau Harbor, stringing together a series of parks. Pick a portion to get a sense of the hilly volcanic topography and the locals' love of nature from the vast Auckland Domain to verdant Mount Eden, the city's tallest peak at roughly 640 feet, and One Tree Hill, another stamina-testing summit. Devoted to the story of New Zealand from geology to politics, the Auckland War Memorial Museum holds treasures obscured by its title, namely the vast collection of indigenous Maori art works and crafts. It's currently in the early phases of a 20-year plan to update the galleries, layout and access, but its rich collections remain on view, including more than 1,000 pieces of Maori treasures known as ""taonga."" These include full-size buildings, a war canoe and everyday objects such as fish hooks, all intricately carved. Arrive in time to purchase your ticket for the 11 a.m. Maori song and dance performance which brings the culture enshrined in the exhibition halls to life (museum admission is 25 dollars, or 45 dollars, including the show).

The city estimates that one in four Auckland residents owns a boat, and seemingly four in four are sailing fans -- particularly after the Kiwi team won the most recent America's Cup race versus the American team so decisively. The America's Cup Sailing experience from the tour company Explore Group (180 dollars) allows amateurs to feel the thrill of a heeling 80-foot boat and the grind of raising the sails on two-hour trips in Waitemata Harbor. The fleet includes a 2003 vintage boat that served as a practice ship for Team New Zealand long before the twin-hulled, hydrofoil catamarans of present-day racing came along. But the older model still provides plenty of speed and the crew encourages all passengers to steer and crank on the grinders to adjust the sails throughout the trip.

The 16-acre waterfront development Britomart, wedged between the harbor and the Central Business District, or C.B.D., mixes historic and new buildings that are rapidly filling with upscale tenants. A strong contingent of them wave the Kiwi flag for fashion, including boutiques from local designers such as Karen Walker, known for refining street styles in ruffle-edge dresses and cropped stovepipe pants; Trelise Cooper, whose dresses combine bohemian silhouettes with glam touches; and Kathryn Wilson, a women's shoemaker with a taste for embellishment. Men get equal attention at Zambesi Store which makes progressive fashion for both sexes, and the spirited World which supplements its inventory of colorful, avant-garde looks with boutique beauty brands. Chic cafes spill into the streets that web the Britomart district, offering convenient respite. The new Amano scales up farm-to-table and nose-to-tail cooking to serve sizable crowds in a former warehouse with rough plaster walls and exposed beams. An open kitchen spans the space, making theater of chefs cutting fresh pasta or roasting chicken. The menu champions New Zealand ingredients from Kaipara oysters (4 dollars each), to grilled lamb chops (34 dollars). Down the street, the similarly seasonal Ortolana offers fewer but no-less-sophisticated choices -- try kingfish crudo (20 dollars) and pasta with clams (29 dollars) -- plus superb people-watching from the patio or the conservatory indoors.

The developing Wynyard Quarter on Auckland's western waterfront, reached by footbridge across Viaduct Harbor, can seem like a warren of construction fencing. But the Auckland Theater Company, among the nation's most acclaimed troupes, already calls it home with the ASB Waterfront Theater, opened in 2016. The 672-seat theater and its spacious lobby, including a cafe, offers exposure to Auckland's enthusiastic arts patrons as well as New Zealand playwrights such as Roger Hall and Briar Grace-Smith in comedic and thoughtful productions tucked between crowd-pleasing musicals and dramatic classics. From the Wynyard Quarter to the C.B.D., it's easy to make a progressive dessert and nightcap crawl on foot. In the Wynyard, the waterfront patio at the North Park Restaurant and Bar, decorated like a vintage sea shack, is a fitting locale for a white and dark chocolate brownie (13.90 dollars). Across Viaduct Harbor, try to snag a seat on the packed patio of Soul Bar and Bistro for ginger creme brulee (16 dollars) and a barrel-aged negroni (18 dollars). Order your nightcap neat at the Jefferson, a moody club which stocks 600 global varieties of whiskey, tucked away in the alley-like Fort Lane.

Coffee-crazed New Zealand is a country where you can find a barista at a rural gas station. Espresso bars seem stationed on every corner in Auckland, but when it comes to caffeine and the accompanying breakfast it's worth the trek to the inner-city suburb of Ponsonby to rub elbows with the flat-white sippers seated at communal tables in Orphans Kitchen. The 40-seat restaurant offers unusual dishes that might include spicy peanut butter and carrot kimchi on toast (8 dollars) and poached eggs with anchovy on sourdough (17 dollars). It's about a block away from the bustling Ponsonby Central, a green market and restaurant hive where you can pick up that spicy peanut butter and other New Zealand comestibles to take home. Auckland can hardly be considered frenzied, but for an extra dose of tranquillity hop the ferry to Waiheke Island, where culture meets nature over 35 square miles of scalloped beaches, vineyard-planted hillsides and welcoming art galleries. Departing from Auckland's downtown waterfront, Fullers offers regular 40-minute ferry rides to the island (38 dollars round trip, or 48 dollars with an island bus pass). One of the newer wineries, Batch Winery, will even send a bus to the ferry. After tasting its bright sparkling wine and smooth pinot gris (tastings, 15 dollars), hit the boutique-filled town of Oneroa to indulge in local bivalves at the breezy Oyster Inn, a nautically themed boutique hotel with a second-floor restaurant where patrons linger at tables on the balcony in view of the sea. IF YOU GO Auckland's top boutique hotel, the 25-room Hotel DeBrett downtown, has changed hands several times since opening in 1925, but its intimate, wood-paneled House Bar has been a popular gathering spot for decades. Colorful, striped, New Zealand wool rugs accent uniquely decorated rooms upstairs. Doubles from 350 dollars, including breakfast and a welcome drink. 2 High Street, hoteldebrett.com. Airbnb offers great value in Auckland where a shortage of hotel rooms has inspired a hotel construction boom. For example, the one-bedroom listed as a Luxury Bohemian City Apartment is in a historic building on Queen Street, downtown's main street, with high ceilings, an efficiency kitchen and plenty of plants. The apartment costs around 136 dollars a night. https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/15119807 If you do plan a trip to Auckland, check out these suggestions on what to pack from our Wirecutter team.","The New Zealand city is laid-back and outdoorsy, but its sophistication shines in its expanding art scene, thriving fashion industry and a new generation of chefs embracing native ingredients.",0ff10fcb-a43c-5e62-84c2-032e2daab4c0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/18/travel/18hours-auckland1/merlin_134693274_e8527b4b-0821-4720-8845-9d4d116eb87d-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=5b2da24cdc0ad962abe6ee7f96ff36ae791cb36700969aef60662143bea4dd3b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A view of the Auckland skyline from Devonport.,0ff10fcb-a43c-5e62-84c2-032e2daab4c0,N24News/imgs/0ff10fcb-a43c-5e62-84c2-032e2daab4c0.jpg,4
Music,The Philharmonic's New Season: What Our Critics Want to Hear,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/05/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-2019-20-season.html,"Freshman year can excite with newness, but it's as sophomores that people tend to come into their own. Jaap van Zweden's reign as music director of the New York Philharmonic came into clearer view on Tuesday, when the orchestra announced its 2019-20 season, its second under his baton. There will be nods to the past, as in an exploration of Mahler's time leading the Philharmonic in the final years of his life. There will be lots of new music, too, with Mr. van Zweden giving premieres by Philip Glass, Tania Leon, Nico Muhly, Sarah Kirkland Snider, Nina C. Young and Ellen Reid. And there will be experiments -- as when he conducts Renee Fleming in Bjork songs. To mark the centennial of the 19th Amendment, which barred states from denying voting rights based on gender, the Philharmonic has commissioned new works by 19 female composers, eight of which will be performed next season. Besides celebrating what Deborah Borda, the orchestra's president and chief executive officer, called a ""tectonic shift in American culture,"" the project sends a statement to the classical music field at a moment when female composers still struggle to be heard.

With so much on tap, what do our critics and writers want to hear? With a little sleight of hand, Mr. van Zweden has moved the requisite start-of-season gala into early October; it's a Beethoven program with the superstar pianist Lang Lang. But for his first subscription concerts he has chosen a somewhat bolder program: a new work by Mr. Glass; Barber's ""Knoxville: Summer of 1915,"" with Broadway's own Kelli O'Hara; and selections from Prokofiev's ""Romeo and Juliet."" ANTHONY TOMMASINI Splashily staged opera productions were among Alan Gilbert's boldest innovations during his time at the Philharmonic's helm. Mindful, perhaps, of their success, Mr. van Zweden will lead a staged double bill of two darkly brilliant early-20th-century works, directed by the Swedish stage designer Bengt Gomer using video, lighting and shadow actors. The formidable soprano Nina Stemme takes on Judith in ""Bluebeard's Castle"" alongside the baritone Johannes Martin Kranzle; Katarina Karneus sings ""Erwartung."" CORINNA da FONSECA-WOLLHEIM

The first time I heard ""Su"" -- Unsuk Chin's 2009 concerto for sheng, a Chinese mouth organ -- I nearly jumped out of my chair. I was using iPhone earbuds, but Ms. Chin's imaginative exploration of timbre still packed a memorable punch. I've loved the work since that first encounter; it was my pick for our ""5 Minutes That Will Make You Love Classical Music"" feature last year. I'll now have my first chance to hear it live, led by Ms. Malkki, with Wu Wei as soloist. SETH COLTER WALLS

This fascinating program offers a hint of what might have been had Mr. Salonen, who is heading to the San Francisco Symphony, become the Philharmonic's music director instead. Between rare performances of Schoenberg's glittering orchestral transcriptions of two works by Bach, Mr. Salonen conducts a pair of his own scores: ""Castor"" (in its New York premiere) and ""Pollux."" The program ends with Hindemith's great ""Mathis der Maler"" Symphony. ANTHONY TOMMASINI Mr. Trifonov has justly rocketed to New York omnipresence, and has become a fixture at the Philharmonic, including a memorable traversal of Rachmaninoff's concertos in 2015. This year he'll play a relative rarity: Scriabin's Piano Concerto, a Romantic but unassuming work that will benefit from Mr. Trifonov's subtle delicacy. (Mr. van Zweden conducts.) His residency with the orchestra will also include a Mozart classic (the Piano Concerto No. 25); a solo recital of Bach and arrangements of Bach; and the New York premiere of his Piano Quintet. ZACHARY WOOLFE

It's not often that the Philharmonic devotes five performances to a single program. But it is handing over significant real estate to a star: Mr. Dudamel, who will lead Ives's ""The Unanswered Question,"" Dvorak's ""New World"" Symphony and a premiere by Esteban Benzecry. Two days after that run ends, Mr. Dudamel will be back for a program of Schubert's Fourth Symphony and Mahler's ""Das Lied von der Erde."" JOSHUA BARONE Play Elgar and I'll be there, but this whole program has a welcome, unforced focus to it, compared to much else in the Philharmonic's sprawling season. Call it a Commonwealth affair, with Elgar's ""Enigma Variations"" and the ""Four Sea Interludes"" from Britten's ""Peter Grimes"" framing the American premiere of the Australian composer Brett Dean's Cello Concerto. Alban Gerhardt is the soloist; the conductor, Simone Young, was born and started her career in Sydney. DAVID ALLEN Joan La Barbara is the kind of gifted, veteran New York composer the Philharmonic has often declined to notice. She's experimentally minded, certainly, but her works contain plenty of more traditional operatic melody, too. All of which makes a commission from her -- set to appear as part of the contemporary chamber music series ""Sound On"" alongside new works by Nicole Lizee and Paola Prestini -- a potential highlight of the season. SETH COLTER WALLS

Mr. Welser-Most has not been on the Philharmonic's podium since 2000, two years before he took charge of the Cleveland Orchestra. New York is on its third new music director since then, but he's still going strong in Ohio, and returns with the kind of sophisticated, new-old program Cleveland audiences will recognize: Jorg Widmann's suite of music from his 2012 opera ""Babylon"" -- the Philharmonic's answer to Carnegie Hall's focus on Mr. Widmann next season -- and Strauss's ""Symphonia Domestica."" ZACHARY WOOLFE It's a work that should play to Mr. van Zweden's strengths: Mahler's Symphony No. 2 (""Resurrection""), a monumental exploration of mortality with moments of ferocity, tenderness, and, hopefully, transcendence. The lineup, featuring the soprano Joelle Harvey and the mezzo-soprano Sasha Cooke, is promising. And it will be nice to get to hear the immense work for its own sake rather than for a grand occasion: an orchestra's return from a strike or the commemoration of a disaster. MICHAEL COOPER The Berlin installment of ""Hotspots"" -- a short festival exploring musical creation in that city, Reykjavik and New York -- is exciting for including the first time the Philharmonic will play the orchestral music of Olga Neuwirth. (She's Austrian, but, then again, the Reykjavik program features a new work by Nico Muhly, a New Yorker.) Conducting Ms. Neuwirth's premiere will be John Adams, on a program with his ""City Noir"" and a suite from Prokofiev's ""The Love for Three Oranges."" JOSHUA BARONE More Adams rounds out the season at David Geffen Hall: his luminous choral symphony ""Harmonium,"" with texts by Donne and Dickinson. The Philharmonic has done it just once before, and it's unmissable. It concludes a program that also features Ms. Snider's premiere and Shostakovich's sprightly Concerto for Piano (Yuja Wang, in some luxury casting), Trumpet (the orchestra's principal, Christopher Martin) and Strings.

Art & Design,3 Lush Parks Drastically Remake the East River Waterfront,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/arts/design/east-river-brooklyn-bridge-park-pier-3-hunters-point-south-domino.html,"One hot, hazy morning, I found a little shade under some pines in the garden near the end of the newly opened Pier 3, at Brooklyn Bridge Park. Slow ferries sliced whitecaps through the East River. In a maze of sassafras and juniper hedges, a woman played with her 6-year-old daughter. And at the pier's big reveal, three tourists, chattering in German, who had crossed from the upland side of the park, snapped selfies around the large sheltering bowl of a central lawn, peppered with forbs -- a mini-version of Sheep Meadow -- half-secluded behind thickets of Linden trees and curving paths. It's easy to forget that barely more than a decade ago, when the idea for Brooklyn Bridge Park was still germinating, there wasn't a blade of grass in sight along that stretch of the waterfront. What's today acres of green space and athletic fields remained a grimy sprawl of parking lots and warehouses on decrepit piers. It required a kind of magical thinking to picture what might someday be.

Now, Hunter's Point South Park has arrived with 11 acres of playgrounds and promenades. The first half of the park was finished five years ago, Phase 2, the other day, featuring a marshy new island and a spectacular viewing platform facing Manhattan. Like Pier 3, it's mostly about quiet places to pause, look and stroll. So that makes three new or expanded parks along the Brooklyn-Queens waterfront alone. This summer. All three projects go back to the Bloomberg era. Privately built, Domino fulfills an agreement its developer, Two Trees, in Brooklyn, began negotiating with the city back then that allowed massive commercial and residential towers in return for open space along the water. Two Trees's boss, Jed Walentas, poured $50 million into the park, volunteering to maintain it as well, and he has said he never had more fun building anything. It shows. The park vastly exceeds what the city required. As for the other two parks, in 2016, Mayor Bill de Blasio, embracing Brooklyn Bridge Park as ""the front lawn of Brooklyn,"" set aside $26 million to complete Pier 3. And the city's Economic Development Corporation has shepherded Hunter's Point South through succeeding administrations.

I like a phrase that seems to have originated with Ken Greenberg, an architect and urban designer from Toronto: ""The melting of the industrial glacier."" The single biggest change to the physical fabric of the city since the RMS Queen Mary last sailed out of town is surely the transformation of the waterfront. New York's not alone in this, obviously. City waterfronts have been changing everywhere, often hand in hand with private development. If anything, the pendulum may have swung too far. Public-private partnerships have many benefits but they always come at some cost, and cities also need industry and economic diversity. That said, these three new parks are good news, especially at a time when Mr. de Blasio, primarily focused on existing parks, has announced no big plans of his own for new parks and still has yet to decide how to redo miles of critical parkland along the East River in Manhattan, where Hurricane Sandy devastated a number of public housing projects. More storms will come. Waters are rising. And so is the city's population, driving up the demand for open space. That's clear from how swiftly these latest waterfront parks have been adopted. At Brooklyn Bridge Park, one of the city's most crowded parks already, Pier 3 adds 4.5 acres of breathing room, sandwiched between soccer fields and basketball courts. The architect, as he has been for the entire project, is Michael Van Valkenburgh. In a park that he devised to be mostly extroverted, stressing recreation and views, he conceived the new pier as an interlude and inward-looking. Frederick Law Olmsted, the father of American landscape architecture, described the beckoning pleasures of a curved path, offering up surprise and a chance encounter around the corner.

Mr. Van Valkenburgh's surprise on Pier 3 is that acre-sized meadow, big but enclosed, spilling toward a plaza beside the garden where I watched the ferries from under the pine trees. The plaza also appeared as something of a surprise. There were roller-skaters the other morning. The river was bustling and diamond dusted. A busker unpacked a guitar. I thought of the plaza around Bethesda Fountain, beside the lake in Central Park, where crowds watch rowboats imitating bumper cars. At Domino Park, Mr. Walentas of Two Trees hired Lisa Switkin, senior principal at James Corner Field Operations, the landscape design firm that famously designed the High Line (with Diller Scofidio + Renfro, and Piet Oudolf, the planting designer). Domino is, in a sense, the opposite of Pier 3. It reveals itself all at once. Pancake flat, richly detailed but overstuffed, it floats a dense jigsaw puzzle of five bespoke acres above the East River on a quarter-mile-long platform. A sturdy, elegant palette mixes stainless steel railings and Corten planters with industrial relics.

There are thornless honey locusts, willowleaf spicebush, purple love grass and lilacs. There's a Danny Meyer taco stand. South to north, the rumble of the Williamsburg Bridge gives way to the splatter of fountains and the murmur of waves through a cutaway in the platform that exposes the piles of the old pier and rocky shore. Designed by an artist, Mark Reigelman, a new playground resembles a sugar refinery. Salvaged, clear-coated syrup tanks flank the park's volleyball court. Two giant gantries, lugged from the water's edge, where they once hoisted sugar cane off barges, are painted turquoise, like the inside of the old Domino factory.

Phase 1 of the park produced five-and-a-half acres of mostly active space, including a central green that has come to double as a de facto yard for a school next door. Phase 2 wraps around the peninsula of Long Island City where the East River meets Newtown Creek. The scrappiest of the three new parks, it is, at the moment, also my favorite. Much of the site feels surprisingly intimate. There are shady little nooks, lovely native plantings and artfully orchestrated vistas. We'll see how intimate and lovely it remains after the Parks Department takes over the park's maintenance and all the buildings are built. I passed some sunbathers on the small, secluded hill at the far side of the island, gazing toward the Midtown Manhattan skyline. Winding paths, just wide enough for two, meandered south, coiling along the waterfront, weaving through thickets of tall bluestem grasses, wetland pools and flowering rose bushes.

A biker paused at the precipice of a new 30-foot-high platform, the park's main architectural statement, its faceted frame cladding a big truss to support the structure's improbable cantilever, which looms, like the prow of a marooned ship, over the river's edge. Briefly, I zoned out to the sound of lapping water. All at once, the skyline evaporated in a silvery, mystic haze. Like an avalanche, a monsoon swept as if out of nowhere across the river. New York never seemed wilder or more magical.","Acres of green space, new or expanded, along the Brooklyn and Queens shorelines offer quiet places to pause, look and stroll.

Opinion,The Supreme Court Could Upend This State's Schools Over $150,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/opinion/supreme-court-school-choice.html,"Scrutinizing the avuncular sphinx Chief Justice John Roberts throughout the impeachment trial of President Trump, I kept wondering whether he will preserve or ransack the legacy of the framers we revere -- framers like the Republican Betty Babcock and the Democrat Dorothy Eck. It's the question on all Americans' minds: Do Mr. Roberts and his eight co-workers fully appreciate the public-spirited grandeur of the winter of 1971-72, when 100 Montanans, including housewives, ministers, a veterinarian and a beekeeper, gathered at the state capital, Helena, for the constitutional convention, affectionately nicknamed the ""Con Con""? The question haunts the current Supreme Court case Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue. This newspaper has called the dispute over whether state tax credits can apply to donations for scholarships to private religious schools ""a proxy battle over school choice."" However, the back story is so clumsily specific to Montana's small population and immense geography that the case doesn't entirely translate to states where people outnumber cows. The novelist Ivan Doig wrote that in the scruffy Montana of yore, ""when you met up with someone apt to give you trouble from his knuckles, the automatic evaluation was 'too much Butte in him.'"" When, as the grateful graduate of a Montana public school, I was determining whether I had a duty to stick up for the Con Con framers regarding the Espinoza case, I spotted a sequence in the web address of an article about it in The Atlantic that read ""montana-bigoted-laws."" At that moment this Bozeman girl had too much Butte in her. Dorothy Eck wrote no ""bigoted"" anti-Christian laws -- she was a blatant Methodist! Before it ended up at the Supreme Court, the Espinoza ruckus started with a $150 tax credit. Montanans will make an appellate-level stink about chump change because that's the only available change. The tiny tax base is basically eight coal miners, a couple of ski lift operators, that family in Belgrade making organic goat cheese and Huey Lewis.

Kendra Espinoza counted on scholarships to help pay for her daughters' tuition at Stillwater Christian, a private school in Kalispell. No wonder. At up to $8,620 per year, ninth grade is more than $1,000 higher than undergraduate tuition at the University of Montana. What we called a ""band room"" at Bozeman High, Stillwater considers a ""conservatory."" School choice partisans pounced when Ms. Espinoza and other private-school parents sued to overturn the State Supreme Court's ruling that the tax credit for scholarship donations violated the ""no-aid"" clause for sectarian schools in the Montana Constitution. They argued that it was time to erase ""antiquated"" anti-Catholic laws against public funding for private religious education. The subtle former state senator Matthew Monforton denounced the law as ""Jim Crow for Christians."" It is worth pointing out that the eighth word of the '72 Constitution is ""God."" In the first draft of the preamble, some wistful Jeffersonians tried to thank the ""Spirit of the Creator"" for ""the quiet beauty of our state."" They were shot down in the Bill of Rights Committee because ""not mentioning 'God' specifically would be unacceptable"" and so they ""voted unanimously to retain Him in the Preamble."" The framers included a priest from Great Falls, Mitt Romney's cousin Miles, the self-proclaimed ""first Roman Catholic ever elected to anything in Yellowstone County,"" and enough Presbyterians to warrant their own photo op. While the '72 Constitution's no-aid clause looks similar to its predecessor in the 1889 original, the update was motivated by fortifying public schools, not shunning people of faith. Rethinking education was, along with open government and the right to individual dignity, part of the Con Con's crusade to take a stand that no one dared dream of at statehood: that Montana would be a state in a republic and not an exceedingly wide company town. ""We were known as the state that wore the copper collar, controlled by the Anaconda Company,"" Ms. Eck once said. A swashbuckler for the League of Women Voters, she referred to the copper company lording over the ""richest hill on earth"" and thus the newspapers and politicians. ""There were stories of how their lobbyists would sit in the balcony at the legislature and do thumbs up and thumbs down of how people should vote.""

The Con Con delegates, who arranged themselves not by party but alphabetically, were so preoccupied with the public interest that they agreed public funds could be spent only on public agencies. During deliberations on the no-aid clause, the pastor of Helena's Plymouth Congregational led the charge of ""preserving our public school system,"" preaching, ""that's what this issue is all about. I don't think we ought to dilute that in any way."" (Diluting that is the aim of Espinoza.) Article X, Section 1, of the '72 Constitution proclaims that it is the duty of the state to ""develop the full educational potential of each person."" That is an expensive ideal in a desolate wasteland. Public schools are supposed to be a volume business, but tell that to the Great Plains. The state of Montana has about 60,000 fewer inhabitants than the number of students enrolled in New York City's public school system. I have volunteered in that epic system, which is to say I have had to excuse myself from a struggling student to go cry in a bathroom, so I sympathize with an urban kid who might eye a parochial school as her best chance. That school choice logic doesn't apply to Montana, where the poorest schools often have the smallest class sizes. The Montana Free Press reported that out in Prairie County, ""Terry High School's sophomore class has just five students this school year."" Starting in first grade, my friend Genevieve would ride her horse Croppy to the Malmborg School near Bozeman Pass; one year she and her brother Pete were half the student body. When USA Today asked Ms. Espinoza if she had any qualms about what her case could mean for public schools, she insisted, ""They have plenty of money."" How I wish that were true. Last year, the public school district in Kalispell announced $1.7 million in budget cuts, Great Falls recently lost almost a hundred teachers, and Billings just announced about $4 million in cuts that mean canceling fifth grade orchestra and band. A Supreme Court decision on Espinoza is expected in June. If the justices rule against Montana's voters, tax credits for private school scholarship donations could surge. Revenue that might revive the Billings fifth grade band program could underwrite the fifth grade band at a pricey Kalispell private school. Kalispell is the seat of Flathead County, which between 2000 and 2015 added more than 15,000 jobs just as rural Chouteau County was losing more than 300. Overturning the no-aid clause will shovel more money into the cities (where most of the private schools are) and kick Chouteau while it's down, thereby thwarting the framers' plan to spare needy districts from taxing ""their residents three or four times as much as rich districts to provide less than half as much money per student."" The public schools the framers conjured ask the taxpayers to splurge on fairness, not privilege, to pull together, not away. That beekeeper, those clergymen and moms chartered a state in a republic where a first grader on horseback is supposed to be as big and important as the mountains. As the Supreme Court justices ponder whether to upend all that over what appears to be a $150 trifle, I'll pass along this lesson of Montana winters: A collapsed roof starts with a single snowflake.

Science,Review: 'Pit Bull' Traces Path From Fighter to Pet to Demon,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/31/science/review-pit-bull-by-bronwen-dickey.html,"Bronwen Dickey's book, ""Pit Bull: The Battle Over an American Icon,"" should give pause to anyone who thinks that Americans love dogs. Many of us do, of course, but as she shows, we love some dogs sometimes. We are terrified of others. And reason and facts may not play much of a role in directing our affections. (Read an excerpt.) Pit bulls are familiar demons, and there have been campaigns by those who love the dogs to change their bad reputation. So the territory the book covers may be familiar in outline. But the case that the dogs don't deserve to be seen as monsters lies largely in the details. And Ms. Dickey not only writes about the ebb and flow of public fear and loathing, she takes the reader on a thoroughly comprehensible tour of genetics and behavioral science to explain why breeding never guarantees an individual dog's personality, and shouldn't be used to condemn it. Pit bulls were far from the first dog to wear the Cujo mantle. And among the several episodes of mania she writes about, none was half as weird as the spitz rabies panic of the 1870s.

The spitz is a small dog that looks a bit like a husky. At the time of the panic, the breed name was used loosely, she writes, ""and it included what we know as the Pomeranian."" At the time doctors had no idea that rabies was transmitted by a virus in an infected animal's saliva, and some thought that certain breeds spread the illness. So they called for restrictions or bans on the spitz, which was common in New York City, and connected to rabies cases there. On Nov. 17, 1876, an editorial in The New York Times stated, ""There are but four venomous beasts among the fauna of the United States. These are the rattlesnake, the copperhead, the moccasin, and the Spitz dog, and of the four, the latter is by far the most aggressive and deadly in its hostility to man.""

Based on this and other accounts, Ms. Dickey writes: ""The most unsettling aspect of the 1870s spitz panic is that Americans seemed to take so much pleasure in it. The act of hating both the dogs and the people who owned them energized large swaths of the populace."" The spitz, of course, is no more venomous than the toy poodle, and no more likely to carry rabies. The pit bull does, of course, have a heritage that disturbs many people. It is descended from fighting dogs, bred for a bloody and cruel sport that was considered all the more horrendous because it was seen as low class.

Helen Keller loved hers. James Thurber wrote of his passion for Rex. Teddy Roosevelt was a fan. And, of course, the dog that ran with ""The Little Rascals"" was a pit bull. Starting in the 1970s, stories about the dangers of pit bulls began to proliferate, many of them simply wrong, and many of them mistaken about the breed involved in incidents. Dog fighting resurfaced, and stories spread about the toughness and strength of pit bulls, some with no basis in fact, like the assertion that a pit bull bite exerts 740 pounds of pressure per square inch, more than any other dog. Ms. Dickey finds no credible source for this number. Most recent research shows that the maximum force of a bite is related to the size of the dog alone. Ms. Dickey's research and reporting are exhaustive, and the book does sometimes get sluggish with details, but it is this work that makes her convincing when she argues that the dogs are more victims than monsters. Pit bulls have, of course, attacked other dogs, as well as people. But Ms. Dickey argues that the idea that the breed is more dangerous than others is weakly supported by facts. Data on dog bites are unreliable because people are notoriously unreliable at identifying dog breeds. Furthermore, only some of the dogs within a given breed behave the way they're supposed to. Not all herders herd; not all guard dogs guard. Breeds are not different species; their genetics are often messy. And most pit bulls now come from lines that had been bred to be pets, not fighters, for many years. She finds that pit bulls are still scorned because it is often poor people who own them. And she writes about dogs that have been killed because of cities that have banned the breed. The book includes a small but disturbing photo of a pile of dead pit bulls killed in 2006 because of what amounted to a ban on the breed in Denver. Dogs do bite. About 35 people are killed by dogs -- all dogs -- each year in the United States, she notes, and children are the most frequent victims. She writes that the best safety measures are close supervision of children and dogs, laws against dogs running free, compulsory licensing and vaccinations and education. But, she argues, picking out one breed to blame is neither warranted nor effective, and a reader of her book will be hard put to disagree.",An exhaustively researched work on the much maligned dog breed concludes that they are more victims than monsters.,d0964e68-2123-5da9-9f7f-3bf6711a787a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/31/science/31SCIBOOK/31SCIBOOK-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=28210b932546c976254c490f43f43b2c2d941d1a89e36e7718745fca198fda7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Pit Bull: The Battle Over an American Icon by Bronwen Dickey

Economy,Public Pension Cuts Exempt Police and Firefighters,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/business/economy/police-officers-and-firefighters-are-exceptions-to-new-public-sector-rules.html,"In recent weeks, Gov. Bruce Rauner of Illinois has traveled the state promoting his proposal for more than $2 billion in cuts to pensions for public employees. All public employees, that is, except police officers and firefighters. ""Those who put their lives on the line in service to our state deserve to be treated differently,"" Mr. Rauner said in his February budget address to the state legislature. By announcing the exemption, Mr. Rauner was following the lead of other Republican governors in the Midwest who have imposed unwelcome changes on state and local employees in the name of saving money and improving services. In 2011, Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin introduced a bill that would roll back collective bargaining rights for government workers and require them to contribute more toward their own pensions and health coverage. He excluded police officers and firefighters from the legislation, known as Act 10, which he signed the following month.

In 2012, Gov. Rick Snyder of Michigan signed a right-to-work bill, eliminating the requirement that private and public sector workers contribute dues to the unions that represent them, whether or not they are members. The bill included a ""carve-out"" for police officers and firefighters, which Mr. Snyder supported. All these exemptions and carve-outs have a popular appeal. Who, after all, would deny the heroism of police officers and firefighters? The hitch, labor experts contend, is that the exemptions lack any substantive merit. ""When you get into structural differences, you're hard pressed to see why anyone would argue that one group should be left out,"" said Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois. ""This has to have more to do with the fact that it's politically dangerous to attack these people."" While no one would dismiss the risks that police officers and firefighters face daily, they are not the only public employees whose work is dangerous. Statistically, at least, there are far more dangerous public sector jobs.

But even granting that police officers and firefighters have a special claim on the public's conscience, it is not clear why the most effective way to honor that claim is through more generous pensions. It might make far more sense to rein in their pensions while raising their salaries, said David Lewin, a professor of management at the University of California, Los Angeles. For one thing, police officers and firefighters can retire with full pensions at younger ages than other state employees (beginning at age 50 in Illinois, often younger in other states). That means they frequently spend many more years drawing their pension benefits, even while receiving full-time salaries in the private sector. This drives up long-term costs for municipalities and states. The early retirement policies also deplete police and fire departments of critical employees at precisely the time when they are most valuable. ""Why stay with a 130-year-old pension arrangement that came in when we thought police and firefighter work was all brawn, no brain?"" said Professor Lewin. ""That forces folks out just when they're adding value and intellectual capital.""
* Elizabeth Holmes Hones Her Defense in Day 2 of Testimony
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. But few politicians are challenging these longstanding privileges or asking police officers and firefighters to sacrifice along with other public employees. In Wisconsin, for example, Mr. Walker and other Republicans argued that it was important to insulate police officers and firefighters because the state relies on them during emergencies and cannot afford unrest in their ranks. In Michigan, Mr. Snyder worried that extending right-to-work provisions to police officers and firefighters would hurt their cohesion.

That argument is hard to square, however, with statements by Republican legislators and governors like Mr. Snyder that their proposals would be a boon to employees -- one that police officers and firefighters should presumably want to share in, not something they should want to avoid. ""This is all about taking care of the hard-working workers of Michigan, about being pro-worker, about giving them the freedom to choose who they associate with,"" Mr. Snyder said when announcing his support for a right-to-work law in 2012. Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican who as a state senator strongly backed Act 10 and now serves in Congress, said that by making it easier for supervisors to lay off state and municipal workers, the law had actually improved worker morale. ""I've heard compliments from public employees that are happy they don't have to work with underperforming employees,"" he said. Similarly, Mr. Grothman said that the real purpose of Act 10 was ""to improve the quality of education and other government services."" But if policing and firefighting are the most critical services local governments provide, the public would presumably be even more eager to improve them, not less. James Macy, a labor lawyer who has represented dozens of municipalities in Wisconsin, said that smaller towns would be well served by pooling their police departments into larger units. He says he believes municipalities could improve the productivity of their fire departments by rethinking the traditional schedule of 24 hours on, followed by one or more days off.

""And firefighters like that, they protect that,"" he said. Some backers of right-to-work laws and curbs on collective bargaining for public employees say they should be applied without exception. A spokesman for Daniel Knodl, a Republican state legislator in Wisconsin, said: ""Representative Knodl's position on the Act 10 provisions is that all public employees should be subject to the same provisions. This should include police and firefighters."" In Michigan, Gary Glenn, a freshman Republican state representative, has drafted legislation that would extend the right-to-work provisions to these employees as well. But for all its consistency, many Republican leaders are reluctant to go along with that view. For governors like Mr. Walker, Mr. Rauner and Mr. Snyder, political considerations appear to trump everything else. Co-opting public safety employees divides and weakens labor unions, according to Harold Schaitberger, general president of the International Association of Fire Fighters. ""Clearly part of what these governors are doing by treating cops and firefighters differently is driving a wedge in labor,"" Mr. Schaitberger said. Police officers and firefighters, Professor Bruno pointed out, are also much more likely than other public employees to be white and male -- precisely the demographics from which Republicans draw their electoral strength.","Recent labor legislation, such as measures to curb collective bargaining and change pensions and health coverage, often exempts public safety workers.",c59250f0-ad67-5c43-a5e9-58947709edad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/20/business/20labor1-web/20labor1-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=f0df718b0f32352b17ed4ff9ec433a12367e155d3a47f8add1a769e72f291c16&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Detroit firefighters at a 2013 fire.

Economy,Oversight Member Blasts the Fed's Efforts to Rescue Main Street,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/federal-reserve-main-street-lending.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve's first-ever attempt to lend money to midsize businesses was destined to be a challenge. The push has proved to be an outright flop, according to a member of the oversight commission charged with monitoring it. ""By any measure, the Main Street program has been a failure,"" Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the Congressional Oversight Commission, said at the group's first-ever hearing on Friday. Mr. Ramamurti and his colleagues, who oversee the taxpayer-backed pandemic emergency lending efforts run by the Fed and the Treasury Department, used the event to critique the so-called Main Street program. One of many emergency lending programs the central bank has rolled out since the pandemic crisis began, Main Street is among the most divisive and difficult. It is supposed to funnel loans to businesses that are too small to raise money by issuing bonds and stocks but too big to benefit from the government's small-business loans. The Fed announced the initiative on March 23, but it took months to get it started, to lawmakers' frustration.

Since it came fully online about a month ago, the program has hardly been used, supporting less than $200 million in loans. While more are in the pipeline, the program's lending remains a tiny fraction of its $600 billion capacity. The difficulty Main Street has faced in gaining traction is a prime example of the challenges the Fed faces in the rescue efforts it has set up during the economic crisis caused by the pandemic. The central bank is well suited to support banks and big companies in times of trouble. But this year it has ventured into markets that its powers, conservative instincts and legal limitations sometimes make it ill equipped to help.

Given current market conditions, the Main Street program works only for a narrow set of companies. Many healthy companies can borrow unassisted. And hard-hit businesses may need grants rather than more debt, but the Fed can offer only loans. Still, a key Fed official suggested that the program would help in the months ahead, explaining that it could support healthy companies that were likely to make it through the crisis but would need to borrow money to do so.

""This program is designed for a business that had a disruption in short-term credit, that was in good shape prior to the crisis and who, after the pandemic subsides, would be able to be a viable business,"" Eric Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, said at Friday's hearing. Mr. Rosengren's central bank branch is running the initiative. He said that while about $100 million in loans had been settled as of Tuesday, the number had increased to $189 million by Thursday night and that more than $600 million in total were somewhere in the process.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""We actually have seen significant pickup recently,"" Mr. Rosengren said. The program ran into problems from the start. Both Republican and Democrat lawmakers have repeatedly raised concerns about how Main Street was designed, worrying that it would not get money into the hands of companies that need it. Loans must be for at least $250,000 and cannot go to highly indebted companies. The Fed doesn't make the loans itself -- banks do. The problem is that banks have been reluctant to participate. The way Main Street works, the Fed agrees to buy 95 percent of any loan that banks originate through the program. That means the banks keep some exposure to loans that might go bad, yet get only a small piece of loans that might prove more profitable, plus fees. That approach has led to questions from many lawmakers, not just those on the oversight commission. ""Many banks seem disinterested in the program because they either wish to retain more than 5 percent of a profitable loan or they have no interest in retaining any stake at all in an unprofitable loan,"" a group of four Republican senators, led by Kelly Loeffler of Georgia, wrote in a letter on Tuesday to the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. The senators recommended reducing the minimum loan size and increasing the debt-to-earnings ratio allowed for borrowers. They also want the Fed and the Treasury to eliminate the loan stake that banks must retain, or promise that taxpayers will take the earliest losses on bad loans rather than sharing those losses evenly with banks.

While the Fed is not supposed to lose money on its emergency lending programs, Congress gave the Treasury Department funds to cover the costs in case loans go bad. Still, Mr. Mnuchin has resisted taking on too much risk with the program, saying initially that he did not expect to lose money on it if the economy played out as anticipated. Mr. Rosengren has repeatedly made the case that the program could help a broader swath of companies if a second wave of the virus erupts and credit conditions worsen, a point he reiterated at the Friday oversight hearing. Congress established the commission to oversee how the Treasury and Fed's economic relief programs were carried out. Mr. Ramamurti, a former aide to Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, is one of four current members of what is supposed to be a five-person panel. It is still missing a chairperson. Commission members vetted many aspects of the Main Street program on Friday, making it clear that the Fed and the Treasury are walking a political tightrope as they shape it. For instance, Mr. Ramamurti both questioned the program's basic utility and voiced concern that the oil and gas industry might stand to benefit. He pointed out that the Fed had revised program terms to make the maximum loan size larger, and argued that the oil and gas lobby had pushed for the change. He urged the commission to investigate the issue and request any related documents on any communications between the Fed and Treasury and the energy industry. Senator Patrick J. Toomey, a Republican from Pennsylvania and a commission member, urged Mr. Rosengren to consider an asset-based lending program, one that might help real estate companies. And Mr. Toomey noted that when Congress had earmarked money for the Fed's lending programs, he and his colleagues had meant to help businesses survive a brief but severe downturn.","The Federal Reserve president leading the Main Street lending program testified before a congressional commission, as one member labeled it a ""failure.""",c92493da-4035-5b36-a05d-7bb98996a44b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/08/business/07DC-MainStreet-print/merlin_171561357_237ae3c7-291b-4d4a-8cbb-6b979b686ddd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c6c41479fd485954947b3359cd3021043dd9fbe1be693c96bc5d9a5226d92cdd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Federal Reserve announced the Main Street initiative on March 23, but it took months to get it started.",c92493da-4035-5b36-a05d-7bb98996a44b,N24News/imgs/c92493da-4035-5b36-a05d-7bb98996a44b.jpg,8

Tame Impala -- Kevin Parker playing everything he can in the studio -- aligns multiple eras, but mostly the 1970s, in ""Patience,"" his first single since 2015. ""Has it really been that long?"" he sings. Pounding major-seventh piano chords like Todd Rundgren, using conga drums to punch up and punctuate synthesizer arpeggios, and hinting at Michael Jackson in his melodies, he comes to the realization that he's ""growing up in stages/living life in phases."" It's an honest part of a long-term evolution. JON PARELES

Cowbells clink, the wah-wah guitar cackles, synthesizer lines wriggle and horns punch terse little riffs in the latest single from Ibibio Sound Machine, a London band whose lead singer, Eno Williams, is from Nigeria; the band releases its album ""Doko Mien"" on Friday. ""Wanna Come Down"" is a snappy funk track that owes more to Prince than to Nigeria's own Afrobeat or juju. Williams splits her lyrics between English and the African language Ibibio but the video clip, alas, offers no subtitles. PARELES The Last Poets, 'For the Millions'

It makes some sense that the Last Poets -- who, in the late 1960s, did more to augur the rise of hip-hop than any band of their generation -- would find relevance today by looking back. This group was always guided by ancient practices, and the last few years have demonstrated that America's troubled racial history remains close at hand. On ""For the Millions,"" from an album due in May, the bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma offers a buoyant accompaniment that recalls the poets' 1972 record, ""Chastisment."" And Abiodun Oyewole reaches further back, rapping a remembrance of black lives lost over the years, and a call to continue the fight. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

Justin Vernon of Bon Iver has been citing Bruce Hornsby as an influence since the beginning of his career, and over the last few years, the two performers have been inching toward each other. This jagged but soothing collaboration was recorded at Vernon's Eau Claire studio. Vernon's singing is characteristically pastel, while Hornsby's has a heavy, urgent grounding. Their hymnal give and take owes something to folk and roots music, and something to jazz, and it's surprising, given how different their vocal approaches are, just how much their words appear to be hugging each other, balms in an emotional storm. CARAMANICA

Nature abhors a vacuum, so with Ed Sheeran largely missing in action, the Australian singer Dean Lewis has stepped into the void. Last year, Lewis's single ""Be Alright"" was a savvy slice of mournful folk-pop. He's just released his debut album, ""A Place We Knew,"" which includes ""Stay Awake,"" an impressively dynamic number about the hope of love that nods to both Sheeran's crisp melodies and his irrepressible urge toward rhythm. CARAMANICA

A breezy cross-generational Mexican-American love song featuring two of the most prominent and long-running Chicano rappers -- MC Magic, from Phoenix, and Lil Rob, from San Diego -- and Cuco, the rising indie soul-pop singer from South Los Angeles. ""Search"" moves slowly and with warmth, in the manner of the slow-jam oldies played for decades on Los Angeles radio by Art Laboe, whom MC Magic name-checks here. Like those molasses-thick grooves, this song is almost guilelessly sweet: In the video, the two young protagonists don't even so much as kiss. CARAMANICA

The Doobie Brothers of nu-trap play tug-of-war with unexpected sweetness over light piano and lighter drums. Nav, as ever, is a font of melancholy and mistrust, and Young Thug ... well, Young Thug remains a master of free-associative madness, concluding with a flirtatious riff that begins, ""You look just like my rich auntie"" and goes on to express sentiments that, for most, would be verboten, but which in his signature wail sound like vivid confession. CARAMANICA

Burrow into ""Hungry Ghost,"" the new album by the guitar-bass-drums trio Typical Sisters, and you might start to notice what isn't there. This is improvisation-driven music, right at the corner of jazz and post-rock, but there are none of the showy, full-band misdirections that have become so typical of jazz today. And while the album's title refers to Chinese Buddhism, these aren't slow, numinous, incantatory sounds, either. Instead, what you get is happily in the middle and something increasingly rare today: group exploration with little flexing or hurry, electric guitar melodies that sound like open promises -- a reminder that it's O.K. to listen with no expectation of a payoff.

Television,Neil deGrasse Tyson's Show Is Pulled Amid Misconduct Allegations,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/arts/television/neil-degrasse-tyson-startalk.html,"Neil deGrasse Tyson's TV show ""StarTalk"" was placed on hiatus late last year after sexual misconduct allegations against him were made public, National Geographic, the network that airs the program, said Thursday.

The most recent accusation was made by Ashley Watson, who worked as Dr. Tyson's assistant on another show, ""Cosmos."" Dr. Tyson behaved inappropriately with her, making comments ""infused with sexual innuendoes,"" she said Thursday. She said she had quit her job as a result.

That accusation was published on the website Patheos in November, in an article that quoted another accuser, Katelyn N. Allers, an associate professor of physics and astronomy at Bucknell University. She used the phrase ""uncomfortable and creepy"" to describe his behavior toward her at a party after an American Astronomical Society event in 2009. The article went on to detail a more serious allegation that had been made before by Tchiya Amet El Maat, who accused Dr. Tyson of having raped her when they were graduate students at the University of Texas at Austin.

In a 1,600-word Facebook post last month, Dr. Tyson described the first two incidents as benign and denied the third.","National Geographic has quietly stopped airing ""StarTalk"" while it investigates accusations of inappropriate sexual behavior.",d9722251-a907-5134-9c76-f68bcf50429c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/04/arts/04tyson/04tyson-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ceb434b996e41d8db192a8880bb2989e80c572c8a8e00daca7741e1e14d45a8c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson.

Media,"AT&T Assembles a Media Team, Joining a Battle With Giants",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/business/media/att-warner-greenblatt.html,"John Stankey, an AT&T veteran who was put in charge of WarnerMedia, is the executive behind the moves announced Monday, which show that the company is serious about tearing up old ways and putting its own stamp on its new properties.

The new AT&T is coming into focus. On Monday the company took a step closer to becoming something never before seen on the American corporate landscape -- part telecommunications behemoth and part media-entertainment giant. The transformation started in earnest last June when AT&T, based in Dallas, ventured beyond its core business and muscled into New York and Los Angeles with its $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the former home of HBO, the Warner Bros. movie studio, CNN and cable channels like TBS and TNT. Last week, the deal was set in stone when the Justice Department, after losing a hard-fought appeal to block it, said it would no longer try to undo the merger. With this final green light, AT&T has in recent days altered its leadership team with an eye toward reinvention. On Monday, the company named Robert Greenblatt, the former head of entertainment at NBC and Showtime, as the new chairman at Warner Media, a job that will give him oversight of Time Warner properties like HBO, TBS and TNT. His hiring followed the resignations of Richard Plepler, the longtime chief executive of HBO, and David Levy, the president of Turner Broadcasting, the division that includes TBS and TNT.

As part of its executive shake-up, AT&T -- which gained 26,000 employees in the merger, giving it 268,000 worldwide -- also promoted the CNN chief Jeff Zucker and the Warner Bros. studio head Kevin Tsujihara, both of whom will oversee bigger portfolios. John Stankey, an AT&T veteran who was put in charge of Warner Media at the time of the acquisition, is the executive behind the moves, which show that the company is serious about tearing up old ways and putting its own stamp on its new properties.  ""If you don't make a change, you're not going to get any change in the product,"" Mr. Stankey said in an interview on Monday. Mr. Stankey's assignment is to help AT&T beat out its traditional rivals Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint by offering not only service plans but also ""Game of Thrones"" and 24-hour news. At the same time, AT&T's entry into the media sphere will eventually allow it to compete in the streaming business against companies it has rarely done battle with before, including the Walt Disney Company, Comcast, Netflix, Amazon and others. He emphasized that AT&T didn't want to muddy the brands within Warner Media, a group comprising HBO, CNN, TNT, Cartoon Network and the Warner Bros. film and TV studios.

""We just needed to get them to sing and dance differently and have them take different approaches,"" he added. With the hiring of Mr. Greenblatt -- who has experience as a mainstream broadcaster at NBC and as a programmer of prestige cable fare at Showtime -- Mr. Stankey believes he has someone who can make Warner Media's offerings broadly popular, without losing their distinctive identities. ""There aren't that many people who have both,"" Mr. Stankey said. ""He's got the right track record."" Mr. Greenblatt, who goes by Bob, took over as chairman of NBC in 2011, when the network was in dire straits. Over his seven years, he brought NBC back from the dead with series like ""The Voice,"" Dick Wolf's fleet of Chicago shows and ""This Is Us."" NBC, which he left in September, now regularly finishes No. 1 among the advertiser-prized group of 18-to-49-year-old viewers. In a statement, Mr. Greenblatt said, ""I'm honored to be joining Warner Media during such an exciting time for the company and the industry as a whole, and I look forward to working alongside the many talented executives and team members across the company.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. While overseeing HBO and the like, Mr. Greenblatt will also manage the product that may be the most important of all, from AT&T's perspective: Warner Media's streaming service, which is scheduled to debut this year.

The appointment of Mr. Greenblatt allows Warner Media to speed up its plans for a streaming business, a process that was hampered under the older structure, Mr. Stankey said. ""We had to put a bit of a Band-Aid organization on top of things before we made this change,"" he said. ""Still, I think we've done a remarkable job with what we had. The new combined WarnerMedia will be much more successful filling in the gaps."" AT&T was handcuffed until recently as it fought a lawsuit brought by the Trump administration's Justice Department to block the merger. The company agreed to take a hands-off approach to its Turner division, which includes CNN and TNT, until the appeal was concluded. AT&T beat back that challenge last week, giving the company free rein. Concerning the resignations of Mr. Plepler, who had been at HBO for 27 years, and Mr. Levy, who had spent 32 years at Turner Broadcasting, Mr. Stankey said, ""I was disappointed but I don't know that I was completely surprised."" He added, ""When you have someone who had a tremendous amount of autonomy, they tend to covet that."" Mr. Stankey plans to be a much more active steward of Warner Media than its executives had anticipated, three people familiar with the new AT&T said. He has started to consolidate advertising, distribution and production departments across Turner and HBO, as well as some of the back-end functions like human resources, accounting and technology. Those moves effectively took away large chunks of matters once overseen by Mr. Plepler and Mr. Levy, the people said. In Mr. Stankey's view, Warner Media needed to reorganize the TV networks in a way ""where they could cooperate more together,"" he said, which meant that some top executives would have reduced roles. He said his discussions with Mr. Plepler and Mr. Levy, which took place separately, never got far enough to explore what roles they each might accept. Going up against Netflix and Disney will be tough. Mr. Stankey acknowledged that a household is likely to pay for just four or five of these services, and that AT&T will have to prove its worth to consumers.

At a company presentation in November, he outlined three tiers of online video services that have been in the works: an entry-level option centered on films; a ""premium"" service that includes original television programming and films; and a final product that includes both of those tiers plus classic movies, comedy and children's content. Under the plan, HBO would still be available as a stand-alone service. But it is unclear which Warner Media brands will be part of each tier or how each will be priced. Even the names of the video services remain a mystery. ""No news on that today,"" Mr. Stankey said on Monday. The lack of hard information on the streaming strategy has frustrated executives within Warner Media, several people familiar with the internal operations have said. But some have wondered if the lack of communication was the result of the Justice Department's court challenge. Mr. Stankey acknowledged that his sometimes laconic approach might have baffled those inside the organization. ""I've read articles out there saying that I'm not prone to flap my gums, and that may not be inaccurate,"" he said. But Hollywood, not used to such a reserved manner, might require him to open up more. ""I'm trying to find a middle ground on it,"" he said, adding that with the lawsuit behind them, he'll be able to talk more frequently. As part of the reorganization, Mr. Zucker, the head of CNN, will also begin to oversee Turner's sports operations. That includes the website Bleacher Report, as well as Turner's deals with the National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball and the National Collegiate Athletic Association. With the job, Mr. Zucker gets a new title: chairman of news and sports. Mr. Tsujihara, the chief executive of the Warner Bros. movie studio, will continue in his position and also take on what Warner Media described as a ""new global kids and young adults business."" Children's content is likely to be a critical part of the streaming service and represents a big part of Mr. Tsujihara's portfolio. ""As the economics change, it's becoming more and more important to align content value, consumer products and ad sales,"" Mr. Tsujihara said in an interview. ""It takes a real need for deeper level of coordination across the different divisions.""","The company's two core businesses are both facing upheaval as tech companies like Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Google and Facebook have become dominant players in both entertainment and distribution.",3b1a99ef-e387-530f-b8cd-737c1654260e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/business/05ATT-sub/05ATT-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=92aabb7c5bb557a5f165516f30c49059c503af64f661989473b0b18c9cf872ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Stankey, an AT&amp;T veteran who was put in charge of WarnerMedia, is the executive behind the moves announced Monday, which show that the company is serious about tearing up old ways and putting its own stamp on its new properties.",3b1a99ef-e387-530f-b8cd-737c1654260e,N24News/imgs/3b1a99ef-e387-530f-b8cd-737c1654260e.jpg,16
Dance,Fest Packed With Artists Bursting Out of the Box,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/07/arts/dance/fall-arts-preview-crossing-the-line-includes-trajal-harrell-and-xavier-le-roy.html,"Crossing the Line, a playful and probing interdisciplinary festival now in its eighth year, hosts an array of artists who refuse to be bottled up and labeled. The pickings are eclectic, from the debut of the Argentine director and visual artist Fernando Rubio, who places seven actresses in white beds in Hudson River Park -- in 10-minute cycles, they whisper memories to audience members -- to Xavier Le Roy's sophisticated yet accessible exhibition of movement and conversation, ""Retrospective,"" at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens. In other words, Crossing the Line, which runs from Sept. 8 through Oct. 20 at various New York locations and is presented by the French Institute Alliance Francaise, is nothing if not an adventure.

Of the 15 offerings chosen by the festival organizers Lili Chopra, Simon Dove and Gideon Lester, Mr. Le Roy's ""Retrospective"" is one of the most alluring events. This French choreographer takes a decade's worth of solo work and recycles it through a group of local performers who dance and subsequently tell personal stories about their own careers. Another European artist, Ivana Muller, also challenges the audience-performer experience in ""We Are Still Watching"" at New York Live Arts, in which spectators are given a script to read and subsequently form a mini-society. Can bad theater evolve into something real? She also presents ""Partituur,"" a participatory work for children.

In ""Quantum,"" the Swiss choreographer Gilles Jobin and the German visual artist Julius von Bismarck explore the quark, or small particles that make up matter, as six dancers swirl, spread and re-collect under industrial lamps designed to respond to movement. Conceived while in residence at CERN, a particle physics lab in Geneva, ""Quantum,"" performed at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Fisher Building, is a merging of science and dance.

Finally, the American choreographer Trajal Harrell presents his entire ""Twenty Looks or Paris Is Burning at the Judson Church"" opus, in which he explores the vogueing ballroom scene in Harlem and Judson Church's postmodern dance movement in six works. In each, he seductively studies the evolution of dance and theater, ranging from intimate ""(S),"" a runway-solo showcase, to the boisterous ""(M)imosa,"" created by Mr. Harrell, Cecilia Bengolea, Francois Chaignaud and Marlene Monteiro Freitas, who battle it out. Just who is the real Mimosa? You never really know.

Travel,"In Stockholm, a Hotel That's Solid and Social",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/28/travel/stockholm-at-six-hotel-review.html,"From about 1,350 Swedish kronor , or about 161 U.S. dollars. The most promising property to emerge from Stockholm's recent hotel boom is At Six, a 343-room hotel in a high-rise Brutalist building that formerly housed a bank. Opened in March 2017, the ambitious hotel is part of an urban renewal project aimed at transforming Brunkebergstorg, a once-dreary square in the city center, into a lively gathering point for visitors and locals alike. Polished and modern, the hotel's monochrome gray interiors were designed by the London-based Universal Design Studio. An in-house curator chose artworks, including Sol LeWitt prints in the restaurant and an eight-foot-tall marble bust by the Catalan sculptor Jaume Plensa that sits on the lobby's grandiose white-granite staircase.

It's a 10-minute walk to the central train station, and five minutes to the nearest subway station.

On the 13th floor, my deluxe room (a middle-priced room category) was a study in moody hues, with dove-gray walls and drapes, smoked-glass mirrors, a charcoal rug and wardrobes cloaked in soft indigo fabric. A black leather headboard framed a fluffy king-size bed with crisp white linens and a half-dozen pillows. Along one wall, a long green-marble desk offered a small work space with built-in outlets beside a TV, Bluetooth-enabled speakers, and a wooden tray with glassware and cocktail-making accouterments. Large glass sliding doors opened onto a balcony with two chairs and a small table overlooking the square below.

Brass fixtures lent a luxurious feeling to the bathroom, which was tiled in beige stone with a slate-gray floor and excellent lighting.

Style,Bishop Michael Curry's Full Sermon From the Royal Wedding,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/style/bishop-michael-curry-royal-wedding.html,"He said: ""I'll never forget my daddy told me when I was fairly new as a priest. He said just always be who you really are. Don't pretend to be someone else.""

And now in the name of our loving liberating and life giving God, Father, Son and Holy Spirit, amen.

From the Song of Solomon in the Bible: Set me as a seal upon your heart, as a seal upon your arm, for love is as strong as death, passion as fierce as the grave, its flashes of flashes of fire, a raging flame. Many waters cannot quench love, neither can floods drown it out

The late Dr. Martin Luther King once said, and I quote: we must discover the power of love, the redemptive power of love, and when we do that we will make of this old world a new world. For love is the only way.

There's power in love. Don't underestimate it. Don't even oversentimentalize it. There's power, power in love. If you don't believe me, think about a time when you first fell in love. The whole world seemed to center around you and your beloved. There's power, power in love.

Not just in its romantic forms but any form, any shape of love. There's a certain sense in which when you are loved and you know it, when someone cares for you and you know it, when you love and you show it, it actually feels right. There's something right about it.

And there's a reason for it. The reason has to do with the source. We were made by a power of love. And our lives were meant and are meant to be lived in that love. That's why we are here.

Ultimately the source of love is God himself, the source of all of our lives. There's an old medieval poem that says, ""where true love is found, God himself is there.""

The New Testament says it this way, ""beloved, let us love one another because love is of God and those who love are born of God and know God, those who do not love do not know God. Why? For God is love. There's power in love. There's power in love to help and heal when nothing else can. There's power in love to lift up and liberate when nothing else will. There's power in love to show us the way to live. Set me as a seal on your heart. A seal on your arm. For love it's strong as death.

But love is not only about a young couple. Now the power of love is demonstrated by the fact that we are all here. Two young people fell in love and we all showed up. But it's not just for and about a young couple who we rejoice with.

It's more than that. Jesus of Nazareth on one occasion was asked by a lawyer to sum up the essence of the teachings of Moses. He went back and reached back into the Hebrew scriptures, to Deuteronomy and Leviticus, and Jesus said you shall love the lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind and all your strength.

This is the first and great commandment and the second is like it: love your neighbor as yourself. And then in Matthew's version, he added, he said, on these two Love of God and Love of Neighbor, hang all the law, all the prophets, everything that Moses wrote, everything in the holy prophets, everything in the scriptures, everything that God has been trying to tell the world. Love God, love your neighbors, and while you're at it, love yourself.

Now someone once said that Jesus began the most revolutionary movement in all of human history, a movement grounded in the unconditional love of God for the world. A movement mandating people to live that love. And in so doing, to change not only their lives but the very life of the world itself.

I'm talking about some power, real power. Power to change the world. If you don't believe me, well, there were some old slaves in America's antebellum south who explained the dynamic power of love and why it has the power to transform. They explained it this way. They sang a spiritual, even in the midst of their captivity, it's one that says there's a balm in Gilead. A healing balm, something that can makes things right.

There is a balm in Gilead to make the wounded whole. There is a balm in Gilead to heal the sin-sick soul. One of the stanzas actually explains why: they said, If you cannot preach like Peter and you cannot pray like Paul, you just tell the love of Jesus how he died to save us all. Oh that's the balm in Gilead. This way of love is the way of life. They got it, he died to save us all. He didn't die for anything he could get out of it. Jesus did not get an honorary doctorate for dying. He wasn't getting anything out of it. He gave up his life, he sacrificed his life for the good of the others, for the good of the other, for the well-being of the world. For us, that's what love is.

Love is not selfish and self-centered. Love can be sacrificial. And in so doing, becomes redemptive, and that way of unselfish, sacrificial, redemptive love, changes lives. And it can change this world. If you don't believe me, just stop and think or imagine. Think and imagine, well, think and imagine a world where love is the way. Imagine our homes and families when love is the way. Imagine neighborhoods and communities where love is the way. Imagine governments and nations where love is the way. Imagine business and commerce when love is the way. Imagine this tired old world when love is the way, unselfish, sacrificial redemptive. When love is the way, then no child will go to bed hungry in this world ever again. When love is the way, we will let justice roll down like a mighty stream and righteousness like an ever-flowing brook. When love is the way, poverty will become history. When love is the way, the earth will be a sanctuary. When love is the way, we will lay down our swords and shields down, down by the riverside to study war no more. When love is the way, there's plenty good room, plenty good room, for all of God's children. Because when love is the way, we actually treat each other, well, like we are actually family. When love is the way, we know that God is the source of us all and we are brothers and sisters, children of God. My brothers and sisters, that's a new heaven, a new earth, a new world, a new human family. And let me tell you something, old Solomon was right in the Old Testament, that's fire.

Pierre Teilhard de Chardin and with this, I will sit you down. We've got to get you all married.

French Jesuit Pierre Teilhard de Chardin was arguably one of the great minds, one of the great spirits of the 20th century. A Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, scientist, a scholar, a mystic. In some of his writings, he said from his scientific background as well as his theological one. In some of his writings, he said as others have, that the discovery or invention or harnessing of fire was one of the great scientific and technological discoveries in all of human history. Fire to a great extent made human civilization possible. Fire made it possible to cook food and to provide sanitary ways of eating which reduced the spread of disease in its time. Fire made it possible to heat warm environments and thereby made human migration around the world a possibility, even into colder climates. Fire made it possible, there was no Bronze Age without fire, no Iron Age without fire, no industrial revolution without fire. The advances of science and technology are greatly dependent on the human ability and capacity to take fire and use it for human good.

Anybody get here in a car today? An automobile? Nod your heads if you did, I'm guessing, I know there were some carriages. But those of us who came in cars, the controlled harnessed fire made that possible. I know that the Bible says, and I believe it, that Jesus walked on the water, but I have to tell you I didn't walk across the Atlantic Ocean to get here. Controlled fire in that plane got me here. Fire makes it possible for us to text and tweet and email and Instagram and Facebook and socially be dysfunctional with each other. Fire makes all of that possible and de Chardin said that fire was one of the greatest discoveries in all of human history. And he then went on to say that if humanity every harnesses the energy of fire again, if humanity ever captures the energy of love, it will be the second time in history that we have discovered fire.

Dr. King was right, we must discover love. The redemptive power of love. And when we do that, we will make of this old world a new world. My brother, my sister, God love you. God bless you. And may God hold us all in those almighty hands of love.","'There's power in love': Read the words of the presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States, who spoke at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle.",171e3a56-8cfd-5ebd-8cc0-3fd4e6baf7a0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/19/fashion/19curry/19curry-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=89ec7fc7a80d567f8bbd345e3f479527dbdf9bf639d31d5f4cf465be47b4e37d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Most Rev.

Art & Design,Art Dealer Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Fraud,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/arts/design/art-dealer-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-for-fraud.html,"Ezra Chowaiki was sentenced Thursday in federal court in Manhattan to 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release for defrauding art dealers and collectors of millions of dollars. He was also ordered to give up his interest in more than 20 works of art involved in the fraud, including pieces by Picasso and Alexander Calder.

He will have to pay restitution in an amount that will be determined in 90 days.

As the owner of a now-closed Manhattan art gallery, Chowaiki & Co., Mr. Chowaiki made a series of fraudulent deals to buy and sell artwork from 2015 to 2017. During this period, he transferred more than $16 million of artwork under false pretenses.

""He sold clients' artwork without authorization, and he took clients' money for the purchase of artwork he never purchased,"" Geoffrey S. Berman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement released after the sentence was passed. Judge Jed S. Rakoff presided.

Economy,"Job Growth Loses Steam as U.S. Adds 98,000 in March",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/07/business/economy/job-creation-unemployment-trump.html,"Looking for a Trump bump in the economy? Keep waiting. After two months of stellar job creation that convinced administration officials that President Trump's policies were paying off immediately, employers pulled back sharply on hiring in March. The economy added 98,000 jobs, the Labor Department reported Friday, fewer than half the monthly number for January and February. The report contained some notable good news: The unemployment rate fell to 4.5 percent, the lowest level in almost a decade and a milestone in the long road back from the Great Recession. The rate was 4.7 percent in February. Wages also continued to rise. But the disappointing number of new jobs was jarring for the administration, and well below what economists had expected. It comes as the stock market surge, which followed the November election, subsides and amid signs that economic growth in the year's first quarter proves weak.

Economic perceptions, as well, may not be playing out in reality. Sentiment among consumers and businesses rose after Mr. Trump's election, but so far, it has not been matched by a comparable increase in spending by either group. ""We've given up on waiting for hard data to improve,"" said Rob Martin, an economist at Barclays. ""It's been five months since confidence increased. If consumption were going to improve, it would have already."" Industries that Mr. Trump emphasized in his campaign -- particularly manufacturing -- continued to add jobs last month, but at a slower pace. Payrolls in the retail sector, meanwhile, declined further, shedding tens of thousands of jobs. The response from the White House, which crowed last month after more than 200,000 jobs were produced in Mr. Trump's first full month in office, was muted Friday.

Also watching closely are the policy makers of the Federal Reserve, which has begun to reel in its post-recession stimulus. It raised interest rates last month and said it planned to do so twice more this year. But signs of a sluggish economy could affect how quickly the central bank moves. ""This raises the stakes for the April report,"" said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR, a research firm. ""You need to see things pick up in April, or else March won't look like aberration."" The market reaction, in any case, was sanguine, with stocks essentially flat for the day. Barclays has said it expects the economy to actually slow in the first half of 2017, before rebounding modestly in the second half. ""Given this data today, we see downside risk in our already soft expectations for the first half,"" Mr. Martin said.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. The consensus view on Wall Street is that the economy expanded at an annual rate of 1 percent last quarter, with the pace of growth in the current second quarter rising to 3.5 percent. The March report represents a snapshot of the economy, not an oil painting. And snow and cold weather in many parts of the country clearly took a toll on the construction sector, which barely grew after gaining a total of more than 90,000 jobs in January and February. ""January and February were abnormally warm, so they were pumped up, and you had some payback in March exacerbated by the harsh weather,"" Mr. Shapiro said.

On Capitol Hill, Republicans acknowledged a glass-half-full view of the report. ""The economy clearly should be generating higher job growth,"" said Representative Pat Tiberi, an Ohio Republican who is chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. ""However, the unemployment rate fell to the lowest rate since before the recession."" The top Democrat on the committee, Senator Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, ignored the new jobless rate and focused instead on the disappointing payroll gain. ""Today's jobs numbers show there are still challenges ahead that this administration must address,"" Mr. Heinrich said. ""President Trump promised that he would be 'the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.' Democrats on the Joint Economic Committee will hold him to this promise."" Last month, when February's payroll gain turned out to be much better than expected, Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, claimed credit for Mr. Trump. Mr. Spicer called the job creation a result of ""the surge in economic confidence and optimism that has been inspired since his election.""

What is more, the tepid numbers for March mask pockets of strength. For example, a few white-collar sectors like professional and business services are holding up well, adding 56,000 jobs last month. Hyland, a business software designer in Westlake, Ohio, plans to hire at least 300 people this year, Bill Priemer, its chief executive, said. That is a 15 percent increase in head count at the company, and it is a sign of just how quickly demand is growing for new technologies like content management, one of Hyland's specialties. ""We are growing faster than the economy and the enterprise software sector overall,"" Mr. Priemer said. ""Digital transformation is a big buzzword, but it's just fancy terminology to describe how business can use technology to streamline their operations."" On the other hand, new technologies are upending venerable industries like retailing, as consumers shift to shopping online and department stores close. The retail sector lost almost 30,000 jobs last month, after a decline of about 31,000 in February. The headline numbers for hiring and the unemployment rate are derived from separate surveys by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, one of establishments, the other of households. Although the two tends to converge over time, they can vary widely from month to month, and March was one of those times. So while businesses showed an anemic gain of 98,000 jobs in terms of payrolls, households reported a 472,000 increase in employment, without any fall in labor participation. That explains why the unemployment rate could fall by 0.2 of a percentage point, even as the number for job creation was far short of expectations. ""I think the headline number was clearly impacted by the weather,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But at some point she said, rosy economic expectations are likely to catch up with a more sober reality. ""Sentiment surveys moved sharply higher after the election on expectations of pro-business policies and tax reform,"" she added. ""So far, that hasn't happened, and the big question is whether confidence can remain as strong.""","The showing was the weakest in nearly a year and followed two robust increases. But unemployment fell to 4.5 percent, the lowest in almost a decade.",22e5f7a7-6d20-5a00-8dcf-989700f13c4e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/07/business/economy/jobs-chart-oct14-1415369016737/jobs-chart-oct14-1415369016737-facebookJumbo-v57.png?year=2017&h=591&w=1050&s=8ce32dc16dfab7fd075e3c84acf686a2f1e1a0789c41303ce41796a2d4613601&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Source: Bureau of Labor Statistics,22e5f7a7-6d20-5a00-8dcf-989700f13c4e,N24News/imgs/22e5f7a7-6d20-5a00-8dcf-989700f13c4e.jpg,8
Health,"Americans Blame Obesity on Willpower, Despite Evidence It's Genetic",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/01/health/americans-obesity-willpower-genetics-study.html,"Americans believe that obesity is tied with cancer as the biggest health threat in the nation today. But though scientific research shows that diet and exercise are insufficient solutions, a large majority say fat people should be able to summon the willpower to lose weight on their own. The findings are from a nationally representative survey of 1,509 adults released on Tuesday by NORC at the University of Chicago, an independent research institution. The study, funded by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, found that concerns about obesity have risen. Just a few years ago, in a more limited survey, cancer was seen as the most serious health threat. The lead researcher, Jennifer Benz of the survey group at the University of Chicago, said that to her knowledge no other survey has provided so comprehensive a view of Americans' beliefs about obesity, including how to treat it, whether people are personally responsible for it and whether it is a disease. Researchers say obesity, which affects one-third of Americans, is caused by interactions between the environment and genetics and has little to do with sloth or gluttony. There are hundreds of genes that can predispose to obesity in an environment where food is cheap and portions are abundant.

Yet three-quarters of survey participants said obesity resulted from a lack of willpower. The best treatment, they said, is to take responsibility for yourself, go on a diet and exercise. Obesity specialists said the survey painted an alarming picture. They said the findings went against evidence about the science behind the disease, and showed that outdated notions about obesity persisted, to the detriment of those affected. ""It's frustrating to see doctors and the general public stigmatize patients with obesity and blame these patients, ascribing attributes of laziness or lack of willpower,"" said Dr. Donna Ryan, an obesity researcher and professor emerita at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La., who was not involved with the study. ""We would never treat patients with alcoholism or any chronic disease this way. It's so revealing of a real lack of education and knowledge."" The self-help route has not been successful for most. Ninety-four percent of the survey participants who were obese had tried to lose weight with diet or exercise, to no avail. A quarter of those people said they had tried five to nine times, and 15 percent said they had tried more than 20 times.

Obesity specialists said there were several reasons for obese people to seek medical help. There are factors, like side effects of certain medicines, that cause people to gain weight. There are also prescription drugs that help some people lose weight and keep it off. And for those with extreme obesity, there is surgery. It's not that diet and exercise are useless, noted Penny Gordon-Larsen, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina and the president of the Obesity Society, which studies obesity and its treatment. But lifestyle advice also depends on whether the issue is prevention or treatment and, if treatment, whether the person is extremely obese, obese or just overweight, she said. ""We need people to understand what options are there,"" Dr. Gordon-Larsen, who was not involved with the study, said. The study revealed that misconceptions about obesity treatment are pervasive. Sixty percent of respondents said diet and exercise were more effective than weight-loss surgery, which is the only method that elicits pronounced and sustained weight loss in nearly everyone with extreme obesity. Sixty-eight percent said it was riskier to remain obese than to have weight loss surgery, which has a lower mortality rate than gall bladder surgery or joint replacement Dr. Raul J. Rosenthal, the president of the bariatric surgery society that funded the study, found this persistent belief in the power of diet and exercise hard to understand. ""If you think a disease is a potential killer, as serious as cancer, why would you take on its treatment and cure by yourself?"" he asked. ""The reaction of people to something that is a potential killer is mind-blowing.""

One problem, though, is that medical professionals can be as misinformed as the public, said Dr. Scott Kahan, an obesity medicine specialist who is an assistant professor at George Washington University and directs the National Center for Weight and Wellness, an obesity clinic. Doctors, he said, learn nothing about obesity in medical school, which might be why only 12 percent of those in the survey with severe obesity said a doctor had suggested surgery to them. ""We are talking about people who are 100, 200 pounds overweight,"" Dr. Kahan added. Dr. Kahan, who is not a surgeon, noted that for most people that heavy, there was no other treatment that worked. Dr. Caroline M. Apovian, the president-elect of the Obesity Society and director of the nutrition and weight management center at Boston University, echoed Dr. Kahan's concerns about the failure by doctors to mention the only effective course of treatment. ""If I said that was the case for cardiovascular disease and bypass surgery, you would say doctors are negligent,"" she said.","Three-quarters of participants in a new study said obese people should exercise more and eat better, even though science says it's more complicated than that.",8421841e-d4df-5e78-a512-3ef2d4b4541c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/01/us/01obesity/01obesity-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a786a45eca5d0cdec202737c9a117b262d8b0955c43797975a83ed68d02cb9af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Most Americans blame obesity on a lack of willpower, despite evidence that it is caused by genetic and environmental factors.",8421841e-d4df-5e78-a512-3ef2d4b4541c,N24News/imgs/8421841e-d4df-5e78-a512-3ef2d4b4541c.jpg,1

Food,Lost in New York at Public Kitchen,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/dining/public-kitchen-review-jean-georges-vongerichten-nyc.html,"At Jean-Georges Vongerichten's latest restaurant, Public Kitchen, the menu is supposed to have a theme: the food of New York City. Nobody I brought there noticed it, though. Somehow it slipped my mind, too, even though I'd read about it weeks before my first meal, and had eaten things like smoked salmon and Manhattan clam chowder. The restaurant is all the way in the back of the ground floor of the new hotel on the Lower East Side designed by Herzog & de Meuron. The owner, Ian Schrager, calls it simply Public, and to make sure it lives up to its name he has divided the common areas into a sequence of hangouts. To get inside you walk down a hedgerow of rhododendrons flanked by two small lawns where hotel guests alight on Adirondack chairs as if they were up in the mountains and not a knish's throw away from Chrystie Street. The scene changes once you come through the revolving front doors to face a pair of escalators reflected off into infinity by polished metal mirrors. It may remind you of the entrance to a mall, and the tacit message is similar: Keep circulating until you see something you want. Around the escalators to the right you come to a Vongerichten-run grab-and-go market and beyond that, the first of two Vongerichten-catered bars. While the other offers snacky highlights from the Public Kitchen menu, this one serves the whole megillah. At the far end of the bar you reach the entrance to the restaurant. Strangely, it's one of Public's least interesting rooms, a yawning, noisy canteen whose walls are tiled with the same shiny marble that more expensive hotels put in their showers.

I've led you on this hotel tour to help make sense of Public Kitchen. The menu is a kaleidoscope because Mr. Vongerichten and Thomas McKenna, his executive chef, are trying to offer up something for many moods and occasions. Customers who don't grasp the INY concept when they see pasta and pizza and Chinese food will still find something to eat, whether they're drinking mezcal below the Diego Rivera-inspired tapestry on the second floor or settling in for a couple of hours at the restaurant. One snack is so popular it's already a classic of sorts: popcorn under a thin Frisbee of fried Cheddar sprinkled with chives and chile flakes. I didn't totally get it, but it was a fun thing to crunch on with a drink in my other hand. So were the little latkes topped with sour cream, trout roe and smoked salmon, straight from the hors d'oeuvres tray of the fanciest Hanukkah party you've ever attended. Smart ideas pop up all over the place. Rigatoni with yellow wax beans and gold tomatoes is saved from ordinariness by a very good pesto in which pistachios do the work of pine nuts. Shrimp toast, one of those foods that are likable even when they're bad, is exceptionally good at Public Kitchen, where the crunch of water chestnuts is pitted against tender, unusually sweet shrimp. There's a phenomenally good steak marinated in soy sauce and dressed with fermented black soybeans and sesame oil. Also wonderful: roasted hake with sweet and spicy peppers interrupted by shards of fried potato.

Nothing else was so misconceived. But spicy avocado dip punched the lights out of a delicately flaky Chinese scallion pancake with basil in place of scallions. Nondescript cheese, bland mushrooms and a pointless egg dragged down a pizza with a very good, light crust. And Manhattan clam chowder, repurposed as a sauce for a fine, clean-tasting hunk of pan-seared salmon, was the answer to a question nobody asked. The only reason I can think of for hijacking red chowder like this is to make a connection with New York. But with a few exceptions, Public Kitchen doesn't explore the city's food in a coherent or illuminating way. And it doesn't come close to hitting, as the website puts it, ""all of the cultures that make up the eclectic mix and melting pot that is New York City."" Thai flavors animate one side dish, roasted carrots in red curry paste and coconut milk. But the main cuisines brought into play are Italian and Chinese, as if it were still 1970. A good menu doesn't need a theme to hang together, of course. The pastry chef, Eric Kalaboke, found a through line in slightly old-fashioned favorites like a fruit cobbler capped with sweet sticks of puff pastry, an extremely endearing chocolate layer cake with blackberry sorbet and peanut butter ice cream, and a quietly spectacular tartufo resting in sour-cherry syrup. As for the wine list, it does a great job of presenting reasonably priced bottles from all over, made by some of the leading producers in their regions. This is a nice surprise in a hotel that seems to have been built as a backdrop for the cocktail lifestyle. And if your big idea is New York City, you're probably better off underplaying it than going all out like the Grill, where they all but park a Checker cab next to your table. There are no lectures at Public Kitchen, blessedly, no footnotes or history lessons. The closest I got to an elucidation of the menu was when a server said, ""Everything is individually portioned and meant to be shared with the table"" -- a Zen koan for our time. Still, it's a sign of trouble that what Public Kitchen is trying to pull off doesn't come across clearly. You can have a meal that is mostly very good, or one that is decidedly mixed, but either way you will probably walk out not entirely sure what sets this restaurant apart, other than Mr. Vongerichten's sensibility. He doesn't layer flavors like anyone else. These days he doesn't have as many imitators as he used to, either, although his spicy tuna tartare slicked with sesame oil will be with us forever. He trots it out again at Public Kitchen, over sliced avocado, with an undulated rice cracker that left oil on my fingers.","At Jean-Georges Vongerichten's new restaurant on the Lower East Side, the menu is supposed to be inspired by the whole city.",c01e6e17-91fe-5506-bc16-59b98d8ff680,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/dining/11REST-slide-3LN3/11REST-slide-3LN3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=14f2371f4b2d87f3ce62d0cf77a7678a0ae95cec07a702fd6d66d66429954ce0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. Vongerichten is also in charge of the food at a takeout market on the ground floor, to the right of a pair of escalators that disappear into a mirrored box.",c01e6e17-91fe-5506-bc16-59b98d8ff680,N24News/imgs/c01e6e17-91fe-5506-bc16-59b98d8ff680.jpg,17
Technology,"Pakistan Bans TikTok, Citing Morals. Others Cite Politics.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/11/technology/tiktok-pakistan-ban.html,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistan has become the latest country to ban TikTok, the Chinese-owned social media platform, in a move that government critics said stemmed as much from politics as from allegations of immoral content. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority said in a statement on Friday that it was banning TikTok ""in view of number of complaints from different segments of the society against immoral/indecent content."" It said it had already informed the company about complaints about its content, but TikTok's administrators did not address their concerns. The regulator said it was open to talks with the company ""subject to a satisfactory mechanism by TikTok to moderate unlawful content."" ByteDance, the Chinese company that owns TikTok, said that it was committed to following the law and that it was in regular contact with Pakistani regulators. ""We are hopeful to reach a conclusion that helps us serve the country's vibrant and creative community online,"" it said in a statement.

TikTok, with its lip-syncing teenagers and meme-heavy videos, has drawn criticism from governments around the world, for varying reasons. The Trump administration has attempted to block the app, so far unsuccessfully, citing privacy concerns and the app's Chinese ownership, allegations that ByteDance has disputed. India has banned the service along with other Chinese-owned apps amid rising tensions between New Delhi and Beijing. TikTok has also faced occasional bans in places like Indonesia and Bangladesh over issues of public decency, as well as pressure in the United States and elsewhere over privacy and content given its base of young users.

But conservative Muslims in Pakistan have increasingly accused TikTok of testing acceptable social norms. They deemed memes and song adaptations as too suggestive and too risque. Many people saw the content as lowbrow and vulgar. There were also growing complaints of underage delinquent behavior and display of illegal weapons. Prime Minister Imran Khan -- a former cricket star once famous for his flamboyant lifestyle who has become increasingly conservative since entering politics -- criticized TikTok as promoting ""obscenity and vulgarity."" Ms. Mirza herself has called for regulating TikTok content and initially expressed support for a ban, though a local media report said she believed the ban should be lifted. She did not respond to a request for comment. ""Vulgar content exists on all platforms, but I would argue that the ratio might be slightly higher on TikTok,"" said Saif Ali, digital account director at Empact Middle East, a marketing firm. ""The whole platform is song and dance, so it was always going to ruffle feathers with conservatives."" At the same time, critics see politics at work. Political content has mushroomed on TikTok in recent months as the coronavirus has spread and the national and global economy have taken a hit. Political observers said that must rankle Mr. Khan and his party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or P.T.I. The Pakistan Telecommunication Authority ""has blocked TikTok not because of immoral content but because TikTokers are poking fun of the Great Leader,"" Najam Sethi, one of the country's most prominent journalists, said in a Twitter post, making an indirect reference to Mr. Khan.

""After the Covid-19 lockdown, Pakistanis going on TikTok doubled to over 20 million active users while economic hardship related to livelihood loss and inflation hit the lower-middle and working class hard,"" said Habibullah Khan, the founder of Penumbra, a digital marketing agency based in Karachi. ""These trends seem to have combined to cause a tipping point in public opinion that got picked up by TikTok algorithms."" Since May, videos critical of the government started showing up on TikTok's main feed, Habibullah Khan said. The prime minister has blamed past leaders for Pakistan's economic troubles and has implored the public to endure the tough times and wait for a better future. ""You don't have to panic,"" Mr. Khan said during one speech. In one TikTok video that was shared widely a few months ago, two users mocked Mr. Khan by saying that the time to panic had finally arrived. Supporters of the opposition political party Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz also started using the app to criticize the government. One such user, Saud Butt, a supporter of the ousted prime minister Nawaz Sharif, 1.2 million followers in a short time. Government officials said the real issue was videos that they said sexualized underage girls. ""Had there been any political relevance of TikTok in Pakistan, there would have been a number of serious political commentators on the platform, influencing political discussions,"" said Arslan Khalid, the prime minister's point person on digital media.","Conservatives have raised questions about public decency on the Chinese-owned service, but opposition groups see an effort to stop criticism of the country's leadership.",d1f96f40-3fd0-5c35-9e81-007372461589,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/11/business/11pakistan-tiktok/11pakistan-tiktok-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e38e61bce44ed25493338e5024b98f7013f8fbb6a87f7c2ea91e6dc282a75fed&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Using TikTok in Karachi, Pakistan.

Technology,A Solution to Hackers? More Hackers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/technology/a-solution-to-hackers-more-hackers.html,"If there's a single lesson Americans have learned from the events of the past year, it might be this: Hackers are dangerous people. They interfere in our elections, bring giant corporations to their knees, and steal passwords and credit card numbers by the truckload. They ignore boundaries. They delight in creating chaos. But what if that's the wrong narrative? What if we're ignoring a different group of hackers who aren't lawless renegades, who are in fact patriotic, public-spirited Americans who want to use their technical skills to protect our country from cyberattacks, but are being held back by outdated rules and overly protective institutions? In other words: What if the problem we face is not too many bad hackers, but too few good ones? The topic of ethical hacking was on everyone's mind at Def Con, the hacker convention last week in Las Vegas. It's the security community's annual gathering, where thousands of hackers gathered to show their latest exploits, discuss new security research and swap cyberwar stories. Many of the hackers I spoke to were gravely concerned about Russia's wide-ranging interference in last year's election. They wanted to know: How can we stop attacks like these in the future?

The problem, they told me, is that the government doesn't make it easy for well-meaning hackers to pitch in on defense. Laws like the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act make poking around inside many government systems, even for innocent research purposes, a criminal offense. More than 209,000 cybersecurity jobs in the United States currently sit unfilled, according to a 2015 analysis of labor data by Peninsula Press, and the former head of the National Security Agency said last year that the agency's cybersecurity experts ""are increasingly leaving in large numbers"" for jobs in the private sector.

Partly, that's because private sector jobs tend to pay more. But it's also because the government can be an inhospitable place for a hacker. Talented hackers can be disqualified for government jobs by strict background checks, and dissuaded by hiring processes that favor candidates with more formal credentials. At Def Con, I heard stories about hackers who had interviewed for government security jobs only to be turned away because they'd smoked pot as a teenager, or violated copyright law by jail-breaking their video game console. These rules may keep a few bad apples away from critical government systems, but they also prevent many talented hackers from contributing. At Def Con, I spoke with Sean Kanuck, a former C.I.A. intelligence analyst who served as the federal government's national intelligence officer for cyberissues from 2011 to 2016. He said that hackers could be enormously valuable, if they were properly enlisted in the fight against attacks. ""These people may be all hackers, and they may occasionally break the law, but they all still want the banking system to work,"" Mr. Kanuck said. ""All of them, if they end up in a hospital room, they want the infusion pump working. There's common ground. And the knowledge here is incredible."" The private sector has already discovered the benefits of hackers. Most major tech companies -- including Facebook, Apple and Microsoft -- offer ""bug bounty"" programs, in which they offer financial rewards to hackers who find holes in their security measures. These companies know that paying hackers up front for their expertise is significantly cheaper than cleaning up after a breach, and they understand that the risk of a hacker going rogue inside their systems is outweighed by the benefits of having well-trained experts catch bugs and vulnerabilities before the bad guys do.

Government agencies are beginning to experiment with a similar approach. The Defense Department offered the first-ever federal bug bounty program last year, called Hack the Pentagon. The agency allowed more than 1,400 hackers to take aim at its public-facing websites without fear of punishment, and the effort resulted in 138 legitimate vulnerabilities being reported. A similar program involving the Department of Homeland Security has been proposed in the Senate. The most talked-about session at this year's Def Con was when hackers were let loose on a series of computerized voting machines. These machines had been used in recent American elections, and most ran on comically outdated software. Hackers eventually broke into every machine and were able to manipulate the software to register fake ballots and change vote totals. (One enterprising hacker even rigged a voting machine to play the music video for Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up."")

There is, of course, the problem of outdated software. But some of the world's best security researchers have also been prohibited from poking and prodding at these machines by a thicket of copyright and anti-tampering laws. (The reason Def Con was able to test them at all is a 2015 exemption to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act that gave researchers a temporary pass to experiment on voting machines.) Now that white-hat hackers have found flaws in these machines, they can pass that knowledge on to the manufacturers and election officials, who can secure the machines ahead of the next election cycle. Hackers, it turns out, respond to incentives. But current laws don't allow hackers to test critical government systems outside of official agency-sponsored programs. As a result, we're missing out on important advice. Take it from me. Several years ago, as part of an article on ethical hacking, I invited a pair of world-class hackers to hack me, using all of the tools at their disposal. The results were shocking. Within days, the hackers had gained access to nearly every piece of my digital life: my cellphone, my bank account, all of my email inboxes and social media profiles. The hackers showed me how, with a few more clicks, they could have stolen all of my data and used it to ruin my life. Then, they helped me protect myself against a future attack by strengthening my passwords, fortifying my devices and teaching me what suspicious activities to look out for. Not all hackers are so helpful. But many are, and we should take advantage of their willingness to help secure our national infrastructure. Maybe federal workers should be subjected to a simulated hack before being allowed to access sensitive information. Or perhaps the government could create a white list of approved security researchers with a track record of ethical hacking, who would be given legal immunity for their work. Private sector companies have figured out how to bring in outside security expertise carefully, without creating a hacker free-for-all, and the government can, too.","What if the problem we face is not too many black-hat hackers, but too few white-hat ones?",b15bdfaa-7c12-509f-8b81-5eb282cedfdb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/03/business/03ROOSE1-sub/03ROOSE1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=30d139aae6bf78123fb8fb681f33d1dddbcc7f174e9cdf32cd7e394db78b230c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In the most talked-about session at Def Con, hackers were let loose on a series of computerized voting machines.",b15bdfaa-7c12-509f-8b81-5eb282cedfdb,N24News/imgs/b15bdfaa-7c12-509f-8b81-5eb282cedfdb.jpg,20

Fashion & Style,The British Supreme Takes New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/12/fashion/palace-skateboards-british-supreme.html,"I am older now, but even when I wasn't, I abhorred a line. Time is finite, and meaningful. Lines are repudiations of that meaning. Certainly, there are things worth waiting for -- a slice at Di Fara? a Lisa Vanderpump book signing? -- but they are few and far between and, in truth, rarely as rewarding as you hope. Worse, the mind roams. Every second you allow your body to be geo-limited by a random desire, your mind is dominated by thoughts of all the productive things you are failing to do. A line is a collective sign of failure. I won't wait more than a few minutes for a seat at a restaurant. I've given up going to clubs or concerts where I'm not on some sort of list. Naturally, I have never waited in a Supreme line.

Sometimes, on the days when Supreme releases new product -- a drop, in scene parlance -- I'll pass by the gaggle of gawky teenagers held behind barriers on Lafayette Street and wonder about all of the potential energy vaporizing into thin air. The loose vibrations and persistent quest for meaning of those young men (and some young women, but far fewer) are endlessly renewable natural resources. Channel it and we could probably end global dependence on fossil fuels in about three weeks.

Instead it's put to work waiting in line, for the opportunity to buy a T-shirt, then take pictures of it and post them on the internet, then sell that T-shirt to a person like me for maybe $50 profit -- $100 on a good day. Work out the hourly wage and it's grim. A company named Wealthsimple posted a billboard across from Supreme timed to last week's drop; it suggested that resellers, if they invest right, can become millionaires. Seems unlikely, but if true, that's a lot of lines.

I suppose if you were eager, you could stand in even more lines, which means you'll welcome the arrival of Palace -- a British Supreme, more or less -- to New York, an invasion announced with an imaginative short film starring Jonah Hill and Leo Fitzpatrick. Shopping Palace in its opening weeks caused existential questioning: How long would the lines be? Was waiting in line for a professional reason as meaningless as waiting in line for boring old consumer desire? Right after the store opened, an online reviewer huffily noted, ""Being told you cannot talk, or smile or indeed move when standing on line is an infringement of civil liberties.""

George Plimpton would have stood in the line, and so I stood in the line. There were maybe 30 of us, less the one kicked off by security for smoking. This informal police force was thick -- four heavyset bruisers, all dressed in black -- and mostly polite in carrying out orders, which apparently included telling one waifish young man that he couldn't wear a baseball cap.

I read some political news on my phone. I texted my mom. I silently hoped no one I knew would happen to walk by and assume I had nothing more worthwhile to do. The weather was cool, mercifully. A half-hour later, I dodged some kids walking out with their purchases in Mylar bags as I was finally allowed in.

The store itself had ample breathing room: high ceilings, sleek materials, clothing racks that oozed dignified European glitz. Near the rear of the long room was a largish pool in the shape of the Palace logo; a constant stream of water poured from the genitals of a golden cherub statue planted atop it. T-shirts, hoodies, tracksuits, caps -- you know the routine. Palace manages a cheer and a sense of wonder that Supreme, in its desire to be conspiratorial, often lacks. It feels loyal to the athletic gear it takes inspiration from, yet it rarely feels sporty. The store carried some limited-edition items, but they went early to the most dedicated line-standers and, I imagine, to those too well connected to stand in any line. (Some of those jackets are on eBay for more than $2,500. There's your future millionaire reseller right there.) In fairness, of the three times I visited Palace in the past month, this was the only time there was a line, perhaps a function of the fact that the most recent Palace drop is, by the brand's standards, less than stellar. Typically, there is more wit.","Palace, another streetwear brand that draws lines outside its shop, has arrived in SoHo.",c35af30b-c708-5aa4-8ecb-d61f413b395e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/15/fashion/15CRITICweb/15CRITICweb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4fbbf2a3814ce5710909d6cdc9ccf77272db73b84e16e844f78bcf8f330c4ab7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Palace, known as the British equivalent of the streetwear brand Supreme, has arrived in SoHo.",c35af30b-c708-5aa4-8ecb-d61f413b395e,N24News/imgs/c35af30b-c708-5aa4-8ecb-d61f413b395e.jpg,19

Art & Design,Germany Sets Guidelines for Repatriating Colonial-Era Artifacts,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/15/arts/design/germany-museums-restitution.html,"BERLIN -- The cultural authorities in Germany have agreed on a set of guidelines for the return of artifacts taken from the country's former colonies. In signing the eight-page agreement on Wednesday, Germany's 16 state cultural ministries, the foreign office, and associations representing cities and municipalities agreed to work with museums to make sure that wrongfully obtained artifacts are given back to their rightful owners. Museums with ethnological collections should produce inventories of those objects and make them publicly available to facilitate any claims, the guidelines say. Germany's public museums are mostly funded by and answerable to German states rather than the federal government. The agreement puts museums -- and claimants seeking the return of objects from collections -- on the same footing across the country.

""All people should have the opportunity to meet their rich material cultural heritage in their countries and communities of origin, to interact with it and pass it on to future generations,"" the agreement said. Former colonial powers in Europe are slowly coming to a view that they have no legal or moral right to own many objects displayed in the Continent's archaeological or ethnological museums. President Emmanuel Macron of France, which was one of the major colonial powers of the 19th and 20th centuries, recently commissioned a report that noted that 90 percent to 95 percent of Africa's cultural heritage is currently held by museums outside the continent. The report recommended steps for returning artifacts that were taken to France without the consent of their countries of origin. Last week, the National Museum of World Cultures in the Netherlands presented new rules for reclaiming artifacts looted under Dutch colonial rule, and promised that it would investigate its own collection, rather than waiting for claims. But many critics say that German museums still have much work to do. Hannes Hartung, a lawyer specializing in art and artifacts who is also a lecturer at the University of Munich, said that the newly signed agreement was ""soft law."" The pact is not legally binding and does not create any reliable legal framework, he added.

""These basic points will not make any legal claims in Germany easier,"" he said in an interview. A major hurdle for legal claims is the question of who can represent groups of peoples, tribes or families who owned the artifacts more than a century ago. But Klaus Lederer, the Berlin senator responsible for culture, wrote in an email exchange that the agreement was an important first step in a ""process of discussion,"" which German states need to follow up. ""It was important to me that colonial injustice is clearly named as such,"" he said. In agreeing to a common set of principles, the authorities also vowed to distinguish between art looted during the Nazi era -- on which the country has made some progress since signing the Washington Principles two decades ago -- and artifacts taken during colonial times -- which until recently were mostly ignored. Last year, Berlin's state museums returned nine artifacts to indigenous groups in Alaska. The artifacts, which came from a burial site, were not taken from a German colony, but the return of the items signaled a shift in how museums were dealing with objects that were collected by European explorers at a time when it was common to take foreign artifacts without regard for their ownership. The Humboldt Forum, a state-funded museum that is set to open this fall with large archaeological and ethnological collections, is at the center of the debate about restitution in Germany. It has drawn protests from activists who say the museum has not done enough to research the provenance of objects in its collection. Berner Wolter, a spokesman for the museum, said the new guidelines would ""change very little for us."" ""The Humboldt Forum has already followed these principles in its plans in recent years,"" he said, adding that the agreement ""represents a renewed call to to pursue this topic even more intensively.""",Officials say the pact will ensure that objects taken from former colonies are returned to their rightful owners. But critics say German museums have a long way to go.,e36010ab-66d4-5d38-809f-9821df21675f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/15/arts/15restitution-item/merlin_144421986_94f3cba0-a82e-4c63-b678-4f187d5c2adf-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=744ced5e575f111862efe9558ad35cc66553d5cfcabfffc085bad294202373a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Humboldt Forum in Berlin, which is set to open this fall, is at the center of Germany's debate about the restitution of colonial-era artifacts.",e36010ab-66d4-5d38-809f-9821df21675f,N24News/imgs/e36010ab-66d4-5d38-809f-9821df21675f.jpg,14
Fashion & Style,"Emanuel Ungaro, Adventurous Fashion Designer, Is Dead at 86",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/fashion/emanuel-ungaro-dead.html,"Emanuel Ungaro in 1982. ""I hate boring clothes,"" he once said. ""I hate seeing women dressed in a sad way.""





Emanuel Ungaro, whose merging of attention-getting colors and patterns with sleek lines made him one of the most talked-about fashion designers in Paris beginning in the 1960s and served as the foundation for the fashion house that still bears his name, died on Saturday in Paris. He was 86. The Emanuel Ungaro fashion house, which Mr. Ungaro sold in 2005, announced his death on its Facebook page. No cause was given. Mr. Ungaro, who came from a family of tailors, established his fashion house in 1965 after working under the designer Cristobal Balenciaga. The celebrity journalist James Brady, in a ""Brady's Bits"" column in 1987, wrote that Mr. Ungaro, whom he had known since the 1960s, financed his first show with a loan that used a girlfriend's Porsche as collateral. The event, Mr. Brady wrote, was held in a small apartment. People sat on the balcony and peered in through windows to see the clothes.

Within a few years Mr. Ungaro's creations were being worn by A-listers like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and being seen in films on Catherine Deneuve (in ""Le Sauvage,"" 1975), Gena Rowlands (""Gloria,"" 1980) and other actresses. His ever-changing signatures over the years included stand-up collars, abundant use of suede, wrap dresses, mixed prints and more. He might pair a paisley blouse with a plaid suit, or prescribe a colorful shawl for a distinctive look, or go all in on polka dots. ""I hate boring clothes,"" he told The Washington Post in 1977. ""I hate seeing women dressed in a sad way.""

Mr. Ungaro explained his approach to design in 1994, when he opened a boutique in Manhattan. ""If you want to exist in fashion, and in any other manifestation of art, you have to disturb people,"" he told The New York Times. ""Provocation, in my mouth, means disturbing to the eye. Not disturb just to disturb, but disturb by showing something unexpected.""

Emanuel Ungaro was born on Feb. 13, 1933, in Aix-en-Provence, in southern France. His father, Cosimo, was a tailor who had fled Fascist Italy. ""My father is like a god to me,"" Mr. Ungaro told The Boston Globe in 1965. ""He taught me to respect line and quality, and to take pains with every stitch."" After working for three years in his father's tailoring business, determined to make a career in fashion but needing a bigger stage on which to do it, he left his hometown for Paris when he was 21. ""I arrived in Paris with two pairs of pants, three shirts and not one cent in my pocket,"" he told The San Francisco Chronicle in 1992. He spent two years as a stylist for Maison Camps tailors, then in 1958 took a job with Balenciaga's fashion house. He spent six years there, absorbing Balenciaga's ideas on line and color and how to drape the body. Beginning in 1964 he spent about a year working with Andre Courreges, who shook up the fashion scene in Paris that year with his mod ""Space Age"" collection. The next year, Mr. Ungaro established his own company, and The Times took note of one of his first showings.

""He likes geometric patterns in multitudinous colors,"" Bernadine Morris wrote in The Times that July. ""He used to mix them up so much that you didn't know where to look, but this time he has put everything together properly."" The 1970s and '80s were his best decades. In 1980, the Associated Press fashion writer Suzy Patterson called his summer show ""one of his best couture collections ever -- and certainly the most exciting seen so far this week."" ""As usual,"" she continued, ""Ungaro had a field day mixing fabrics with a whole rainbow of silks in the same outfit. In a favorite type of skirt, stripes or plaids and paisley appear on the same piece of fabric, and everything shimmers with Jacquard weave.""","Mr., Ungaro's clothes could be both chic and surprising. Fashion, he believed, should be ""disturbing to the eye.""",d93ec8a7-40f9-57f2-bad5-a3802d1c1abd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/24/obituaries/24Ungaro-obit2/23Ungaro-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=22b0fe3180fbfe54a583059ca01484fd7f6366da84bfc39a6aed8787469e0d9c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. Ungaro preparing for a fall 1981 ready-to-wear preview. &ldquo;If you want to exist in fashion, and in any other manifestation of art, you have to disturb people,&rdquo; he once said.",d93ec8a7-40f9-57f2-bad5-a3802d1c1abd,N24News/imgs/d93ec8a7-40f9-57f2-bad5-a3802d1c1abd.jpg,19
Technology,Huawei Security 'Defects' Are Found by British Authorities,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/technology/huawei-security-british-report.html,"LONDON -- A British review of Huawei found ""significant"" security problems with the Chinese company's telecommunications equipment, a conclusion that supports a United States effort to ban it from next-generation wireless networks. The British report, released on Thursday, said there were ""underlying defects"" in Huawei's software engineering and security processes that governments or independent hackers could exploit, posing risks to national security. While the report did not call for an outright ban of Huawei equipment, it was endorsed by the country's top cybersecurity agency. The conclusions buttress the Trump administration's push to convince its allies that Huawei, the world's largest maker of telecommunications equipment, creates grave risks to national security. The White House has accused Huawei of being an arm of the Chinese government that can be used for spying or to sabotage communications networks, a charge that Huawei has vehemently denied. But the American push has run into hurdles. Many countries, including Britain, have resisted the effort to ban Huawei, arguing that the risk can be mitigated. It is a critical time for wireless carriers as they prepare to spend billions of dollars to introduce next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G, which governments see as essential infrastructure for a rapidly digitizing global economy.

The British report highlights broader challenges facing many countries. While Huawei products may pose cybersecurity risks, the company is a key provider of the equipment needed to build 5G networks. If countries issue an outright ban, they could face costly delays in adopting the technology that not only will increase the download speeds of mobile phones but is expected to create breakthroughs in manufacturing, transportation and health care. And Huawei is already a central part of many countries' telecommunications networks, making a ban logistically difficult. Governments are looking to continue using Huawei's equipment while limiting its risks. Germany, India and the United Arab Emirates, among others, have signaled they are unlikely to follow the Americans' lead on a ban of Huawei's 5G equipment. In a statement, Huawei said the British report ""details some concerns about Huawei's software engineering capabilities. We understand these concerns and take them very seriously."" This week, the European Union issued recommendations on securing 5G networks that didn't call for a Huawei ban. The British government is expected to issue new telecommunications regulations this year. One main concern raised by the United States and others pushing for a ban is Huawei's ties to the Chinese government, which maintains tight control over the national economy. A law adopted by China in 2017 has been interpreted as requiring companies to provide assistance to Beijing on national security matters.

Garrett Marquis, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said the United States commended Britain ""for taking a hard look at its telecommunications vendors in order to ensure the maximum security of its networks."" He added, ""We share many of the concerns listed in the Oversight Board's report."" Let Us Help You Protect Your Digital Life

The British authorities are trying to differentiate Huawei's security flaws from a broader effort by Beijing to infiltrate its networks. The report on Thursday described a company with poor engineering practices and problems stemming from those engineering flaws, more than one operating at the orders of Chinese authorities. In the report, British officials determined that Huawei could not replicate much of the software it built, meaning that the authorities could not be sure what code was being introduced into the country's wireless networks. They added that Huawei had poor oversight of suppliers that provided components for its products. ""There remains no end-to-end integrity,"" the report said. A senior American government official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive internal deliberations about Huawei, said the British finding of pervasive sloppy engineering underscored concerns about the security risks and hidden costs of using cheaper Huawei equipment in 5G networks. The environment at Huawei could allow for the intentional introduction of an exploitable flaw that would be lost in the background noise of poor practices, the official said. The official added that the intelligence community did not expect to find overt, smoking-gun ""back doors"" in Huawei code clearly meant to permit illicit access to network data. Instead, it expects ""bug doors"" -- flaws that can be explained away as a mere mistake if they come to light, but that can be exploited for the same purposes by China or by other sophisticated actors who discover them. Since 2010, Britain has had an oversight board, now led by the National Cyber Security Center, tasked with overseeing Huawei's operations. The company's products and code are reviewed at a security lab about 70 miles outside London. In November, after British officials raised questions with Huawei about its practices, the company pledged to spend $2 billion over the next five years to improve its software and security processes. The approach is seen as a potential model for other countries looking to add more safeguards over Huawei. Germany has opened a security lab in Bonn where Huawei's equipment and code can be reviewed. The company has also opened a facility in Brussels to appease the concerns of European Union officials.",Britain bolstered White House claims that the Chinese company poses a cybersecurity risk.

Your Money,"Founded for the Poor, Mass General Looks to the Wealthy",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/your-money/founded-for-the-poor-mass-general-looks-to-the-wealthy.html,"Can a hospital founded more than 200 years ago to treat the poor also adopt a form of medicine some criticize as health care for the rich? The answer may come in August, when Massachusetts General Hospital, the third-oldest general hospital in the nation, plans to open a concierge medicine practice. Based in Boston, the hospital, whose $800 million annual research budget is among the nation's biggest, is affiliated with Harvard Medical School and is perennially ranked No. 1 in many categories of U.S. News & World Report's listings of the country's best hospitals. Despite its reputation, Mass General -- as it is known -- was established in 1811 to care for the city's poor and indigent. Patients in concierge medicine are likely to be anything but that.

For $6,000 a year (and whatever their insurance pays), patients in its new Concierge Medicine Practice will get round-the-clock access to their doctors (initially, there will be three in the practice), as well as personalized nutritional, exercise and wellness counseling. The idea of wealthy people paying doctors a retainer for exclusive service is not new. With concierge medicine, which was introduced in the 1990s, patients pay physicians a monthly or annual retainer and expect more personalized care and greater access. ""A concierge patient who signs up for a practice is not only looking for quality care, they are looking for unfettered access to their provider,"" said Dr. Michael R. Jaff, the medical director of Mass General's Center for Specialized Services and a professor at Harvard Medical School. There are pros and cons to concierge medicine -- or direct primary care, a similar model -- which, according to the industry trade magazine Concierge Medicine Today, is embraced by about 6,000 doctors across the country. (Another 6,000, the magazine estimates, are in practices that offer some form of retainer or concierge service.) ""The upside is that it gives more time for patient-physician interaction, and the data shows that generally the more time a patient has with a physician, the better the outcome,"" said Dr. Wanda D. Filer, president of the American Academy of Family Physicians. ""The downside is that it can be very exclusive and difficult for middle- and low-income patients to afford. So there's a concern that you'll have a two-tier system."" In recent years, concierge medicine and similar types of programs have spread from private practices to hospitals. Mass General's embrace of it may prove influential.

""It's a significant development, simply because of the name and the prestige,"" said J. Catherine Sykes, publisher of Concierge Medicine Today. ""To have an organization that has the core values Mass General holds enter this arena adds momentum to the movement."" To critics of concierge medicine, Mass General's foray into the field is no cause for celebration. ""It's worrisome, unless you're rich,"" said Pauline Rosenau, professor of public health at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Houston. As for the hospital's historical mission, she added, ""I'd say it's in jeopardy."" ""Health care economics are such, as well as the needs and wants of some different patient populations, that we're offering this concierge model,"" said Misty Hathaway, Mass General's senior director for specialized services. ""It won't be the right model for everybody, but it will help us generate different sources of revenue in a way to fund the core mission."" Mass General's concierge practice will be housed at 50 Staniford Street, a 10-minute walk from the hospital's main building on Fruit Street, in Boston's West End. The location was chosen for symbolic and practical reasons. ""We didn't say, 'Let's just open a private office in Beacon Hill and put the Mass General logo on the door,'"" said Dr. Jaff, who will oversee the new service. ""We wanted the practice to be integrated into the institution."" The proximity to the main hospital will give concierge patients easy access to Mass General's specialists (something not typically offered in private concierge services). ""We've made the institutional commitment that these patients will get the best of the best at a phone call,"" Dr. Jaff said. ""So if I call and say I need a general surgeon, they'll have a world-class general surgeon that day."" As for benefits of the concierge practice for the rest of the hospital's patients (Mass General has about 1.5 million outpatient visits a year), Dr. Jaff admitted they were a little less tangible, though still critical. ""With dwindling reimbursement,"" he said, ""there needs to be other sources of revenue to help us support our mission to the community at large."" What some call ""health care for the rich,"" the hospital says it believes, can be one such source.",The 205-year-old Boston hospital plans to open a concierge medical practice in the summer.,bb9e2c57-4609-5be3-9ab0-a12f42435fc6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/your-money/14CONCIERGE/14CONCIERGE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5e790b2da8c43970fd5a69b7d6061e4d23cdc6869b138b6bc4252788c7a9dc9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""We've made the institutional commitment that these patients will get the best of the best at a phone call,"" said Dr. Michael R.

Real Estate,A Connecticut Retreat Designed to Attract Houseguests,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/realestate/a-connecticut-retreat-designed-to-attract-houseguests.html,"When Manhattanites Matt Rappoport and Beno Varela began looking for a new home in Connecticut, they had mixed feelings about making the move. Mr. Rappoport, an attorney, was ready to leave his job at a large law firm, and Dr. Varela, a gastroenterologist, had found a practice he planned to join in Hamden, Conn. But their friends and social lives were in New York, even though Mr. Rappoport had grown up in Fairfield, Conn. ""We were moving out of the city to a neighborhood where we had no social ties, other than Matt's family,"" said Dr. Varela, 35.

""There were nerves, as a gay couple, without kids, moving to the suburbs,"" said Mr. Rappoport, 31, who is now the chief executive of a finance start-up. Matt Rappoport and Beno Varela bought and renovated a 19th-century house in Fairfield, Conn., with help from J.P. Franzen Associates Architects and RC Studio. But they had an idea about how to calm those nerves: Find a charming house and transform it into a destination so compelling that it would lure their friends for regular visits. ""It was really important to us to create a beautiful space,"" Dr. Varela said. ""I wanted to feel like we could host and welcome people from the city."" When they began hunting for a house in late 2016, they realized there was another issue: Most homes on lots with the leafy, country feeling they wanted were far too large -- between 4,000 and 6,000 square feet. ""Coming from a 1,200-square-foot apartment, which was really big for the city, to a house that was 4,000 square feet seemed crazy to us,"" Mr. Rappoport said.

Finally, they found a 2,500-square-foot, three-bedroom home in Fairfield, dating to the 1830s. It was far from perfect: The main entrance opened directly into the kitchen; it didn't have the home office Mr. Rappoport needed; and an oddly placed powder room made the ground floor seem dark and chopped up. But they bought it for $937,500 in March 2017 with the intention of making some changes. The house had originally been built a short distance away, serving as a general store in the 19th century. It was moved to its present location and converted into a home in 1929. A renovation in 2011 produced the kitchen that Mr. Rappoport and Dr. Varela liked and planned to keep. To overhaul the rest, they turned to Jack Franzen, of J.P. Franzen Associates Architects, and Rena Cherny, an interior designer who owns RC Studio, who developed plans to reconfigure the ground floor by demolishing the powder room -- which sat at one end of the living room, blocking light from two windows -- and create a single, bright living-and-dining area. Then they used the footprint of the old formal dining room to create a new powder room and home office.

The objective was ""to clean it up, but to keep the charm of it, while making better use of the spaces,"" Mr. Franzen said. ""We wanted it to be cozy for entertaining, but definitely modern and fresh, while maintaining all the elements of an old home: the original windows, doors, hardware and shutters,"" Ms. Cherny said. ""The vibe of a country home, but with fresh furnishings."" Achieving that took about a year and $250,000, as Ms. Cherny delicately negotiated the purchase of furniture and accessories that suited Mr. Rappoport's preference for midcentury-modern design and Dr. Varela's desire for softness and a touch of the traditional.

""Part of what we needed her for was to mediate between us,"" Mr. Rappoport said. ""To understand both of us, and find things that worked."" Added Dr. Varela, ""She was really our therapist for that entire year."" Ms. Cherny furnished the living room with a carefully chosen mix of clean-lined, comfortable furniture, including a cushy Montauk sectional sofa, a corduroy wool Tibetano rug and a large custom-upholstered ottoman. The dining area has harder, more angular elements, including steel-and-wood Standard chairs from Vitra, an Agnes chandelier from Roll & Hill and a slender concrete dining table from ABC Carpet & Home, as well as a moody Jenny Boot photograph that the couple bought at the New York Affordable Art Fair.",Finding a home in the country was the easy part.

Science,"The Swiss Consider the Lobster. It Feels Pain, They Decide.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/science/lobster-pain-swiss.html,"The government of Switzerland kicked off a debate this week when it ordered that lobsters and other crustaceans no longer be dropped alive into boiling water. Boiling them causes pain, the government said, and should be replaced by a more rapid method of death -- such as stunning. Still, even the scientist who conducted the foundational research for the government's decision said he's not 100 percent sure that lobsters can feel pain. But he's concerned enough that he's only cooked a live lobster once and doesn't plan to do it again. ""There's no absolute proof, but you keep running experiments and almost everything I looked at came out consistent with the idea of pain in these animals,"" said Robert Elwood, professor emeritus of animal behavior at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland. ""There should be a more humane approach with lobsters."" Dr. Elwood's position -- and the Swiss government's -- is outside the scientific mainstream, said Joseph Ayers, a professor of marine and environmental sciences at Northeastern University in Boston.

""I think the idea of producing such a law is just a bunch of people anthropomorphizing lobsters,"" Dr. Ayers said, adding that there were other possible explanations for Dr. Elwood's findings. ""I find it really quite remarkable that people attribute to these animals humanlike responses when they simply don't have the hardware for it."" Lobsters lack the brain anatomy needed to feel pain, said Dr. Ayers, who builds robots modeled on lobster and sea lamprey neurobiology. Lobsters and other crustaceans are often swallowed whole by predators, he added, so they never needed to evolve the ability to detect pain from say, warming water or an electric shock. Michael Tlusty, a lobster biologist at the University of Massachusetts Boston, takes a middle ground. He agrees that lobsters lack the brain anatomy that we associate with pain sensation. But crustacean brains are so different from ours, he said, that no one can really say for certain what they are feeling. For instance, when a lobster's claw is being attacked, it will jettison its own arm to escape. ""When a human does that, we make a movie about it,"" Dr. Tlusty said, referring to the 2010 survival drama ""127 Hours."" Lobsters continue to twitch after they've had their limbs ripped off, he noted, but it's unclear whether that's in response to unpleasant sensations or a programmed reflex -- like your leg kicking when a doctor taps your knee in a particular place.

Dr. Elwood got the idea for researching lobster pain about a dozen years ago at his local pub. Celebrity chef Rick Stein, known for his seafood dishes, was having a pint, and Dr. Elwood introduced himself. The chef stumped him by asking if lobsters felt pain when cooked. In several studies since, Dr. Elwood has shown that crustaceans guard wounded limbs and avoid areas where they've been shocked -- even leaving their shells behind if necessary. When he traveled to Singapore, he said he watched as street sellers kept grabbing live crabs as they scuttled off a barbecue grill, keen to get away. He's now convinced that those responses are the crustacean equivalent of pain. As David Foster Wallace observed in his famous article ""Consider the Lobster,"" lobsters remain the only animals we still kill in our own kitchens. We have to face the ethics of that decision, he noted, while we more easily ignore such feelings about other animals in our diet. Boiling might take as long as a minute to kill a lobster, long enough for it to suffer, Dr. Elwood said. A skilled chef who slices right into a lobster's head should be able to kill the animal faster, he said. ""That should be a reasonable way of doing it."" He also mentioned a commercial device called a Crustastun that zaps the animal with electricity, promising to kill it instantly. The Swiss government cited electrocution as a preferred method of killing, though the Crustastun, which reportedly costs $3,400, is meant to be used by processors or large restaurants. Dr. Ayers dismissed the method, saying he's seen animals moving for minutes after being stunned. He said he loves lobsters as much as anyone -- he's devoted his career to studying them, and his son is a lobster fisherman -- but he said he doesn't see a more humane way of killing lobsters than dunking them headfirst into a pot of boiling water. Dr. Tlusty has an alternative strategy: He puts lobsters on ice to slow their nervous system before they meet the pot.",The Swiss government has banned tossing lobsters and other crustaceans into boiling water.

Fashion & Style,"Carolina Herrera, Then and Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/29/fashion/carolina-herrera-scad-fash-museum.html,"Carolina Herrera's fabled life is one that is best captured in pictures. Over the years the camera has caught her immaculate in tennis whites at her beach house in Venezuela; clasping the hand of a youthful Mick Jagger on the island of Mustique; lolling on the beach in Majorca, damp hair slicked back, her lips in a sultry pout. There are the glamour shots: Bruce Weber's 2001 portrait in which Mrs. Herrera kicks up her heels, and her ruffled skirt, at a party in Santo Domingo; Robert Mapplethorpe's 1979 portrait of the designer in a veiled pillbox hat and gumball-size pearl earrings, looking every inch the movie siren; and the famous Warhol screen print, her eyes rimmed in turquoise, her expression serene. Mementos of a life on the fly, those images fill coffee table books, countless magazines and the silver frames that crowd her office, suggesting to a visitor that when the designer does finally appear in the flesh, she'll be carefully sealed under glass.

We met on the eve of her departure for Atlanta, where a retrospective celebrating her 35 years in fashion was to be held at the SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion and Film, part of a joint exhibition with the SCAD Museum of Art in Savannah, Ga. On view in the show, called ""Refined Irreverence,"" is the designer's vibrant legacy. But Mrs. Herrera said she was not resting on her laurels. ""I'm very competitive,"" she said, her tone adamantine. ""If you don't compete, you're not challenged enough. And if you think you are doing everything perfectly, then it's time to retire."" Retirement is not on her agenda. There are gowns to whip up, parties to go to. And of course there is the legend to uphold. Carolina Herrera first claimed attention with her extravagant evening dresses and wedding gowns, one of them famously worn by Caroline Kennedy. But well before 1981, when she hung her shingle on East 57th Street and created the pouf-shouldered confections that would earn her the sobriquet Our Lady of the Sleeves, she was a fixture on the international scene.

At 77, with an Instagram following of over a million, Mrs. Herrera is still turning heads, pristine in her signature white shirts, her hair deftly wound into a Champagne-colored chignon. And she is still making news. Earlier this month, the house of Herrera announced the opening of a 4,000-square-foot luxury boutique on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, Calif., the latest in an international network of shops that house both her ready-to-wear and bridal collections. In the spring of last year, Puig, her parent company, appointed Francois Kress as the house's chief executive. The announcement was swiftly followed by the replacement of several members of her design team with Laura Kim and Fernando Garcia, veterans of Oscar de la Renta and partners in the up-and-coming label Monse. It was a turbulent period, during which she dismissed Herve Pierre, her creative director of 14 years. Eliding over the pressures that may have prompted that decision, she said simply: ""It was time for me to change. He felt it, too.""

She added, ""Sometimes in life, even if you're sad about it, you have to move on."" It's a precept she learned as a girl on her family's estate in Venezuela. There, she may have languished in what Hamish Bowles, a columnist for Vogue, has described as ""a lost era of white-gloved propriety, where exquisitely turned-out ladies indulged in concours d'elegance for charity, attended dog shows and garden parties, and exerted themselves with tennis and riding."" That wasn't the future she chose. In the late '60s, soon after their marriage (the second for Mrs. Herrera, who wed for the first time at 18), the couple embarked on what some may view as an extended honeymoon, flitting blithely from the V.I.P. room of Studio 54 to Kensington Palace to visit their friend Princess Margaret; on to Paris, where they mingled with the Rothschilds; and to the South of France, as guests of the Fiat magnate Gianni Agnelli.

Their outings were chronicled in the society pages, Mrs. Herrera a showy fixture on the best-dressed lists. Before the gilded pair made their move to New York, she would be seen each winter sweeping toward the entrance of the Costume Institute gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a magnet for guests and passers-by. On one such occasion, Andre Leon Talley, a former editor at Women's Wear Daily and Vogue, spied her making her entrance. She was wearing, as he effusively recalled, ""a deep black velvet dress with an extraordinary Infanta skirt."" ""When she came up the stairs,"" he added, ""the Red Sea parted."" Fond of entertaining in their tuberose-scented Upper East Side townhouse, the Herreras gave intimate dinners that, from a current vantage, are the stuff of myth.

As recounted by Michael Gross in The New York Times, one memorable New Year's Eve the Herreras ""had just called guests together to eat 12 grapes each, one per each month of 1987."" That gesture would have seemed decadent were it not offered in a spirit of cheery bonhomie. It was an old Spanish custom, Mrs. Herrera declared at the time. The designer's intimate showings on East 57th Street were attended by the elite: C. Z. Guest, Doris Duke and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, a devout client. Her first show at the Metropolitan Club was, in the phrase of John Duka, then a Times fashion columnist, greeted by thunderous applause, ""as thunderous, almost, as the ruffles Mrs. Herrera showed."" But in some quarters, those early collections met with stinging skepticism. Mrs. Herrera had emerged, as Joan Juliet Buck, the writer and former French Vogue editor, later recalled, ""as one of a group of society ladies extending their love of clothes into an attempt at self-definition."" Her efforts were underappreciated. During one of her maiden runway presentations, Carrie Donovan, then fashion editor of The Times Magazine, was heard to say, ""It's all a little matronly, don't you think?""

""Hers is obviously not a hidebound elegance,"" Mr. Bowles said. ""The cultural changes that run through her life are reflected in her work."" There is one look the designer recalled with particular pride, a velvet tuxedo jacket shown with shorts that in 1987 was decades ahead of its time. When she strolled through the exhibition late last week, Mrs. Herrera said she was moved. ""It was a dream that became a reality,"" she said. ""I was left speechless."" What will visitors and fashion students glean from the exhibition? The designer considered for a beat. ""They will see that the clothes are timeless,"" she said finally. ""And they will learn to persevere.""","As a museum celebrates the fashion designer's 35-year career, she dismisses talk of retirement.",ba129134-9434-500c-9dde-acb422ba53f8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/29/fashion/29REEF3/29REEF3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=45381a9afbe4464a0a85c0978759e6c68f1e3f09e6cad7230600a6d4f2554ec0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Carolina Herrera touring her retrospective show at SCAD FASH in Atlanta.,ba129134-9434-500c-9dde-acb422ba53f8,N24News/imgs/ba129134-9434-500c-9dde-acb422ba53f8.jpg,19
Real Estate,In Clinton Hill: Their First Apartment Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/realestate/in-clinton-hill-their-first-apartment-together.html,"In her first year as an architecture student at the Pratt Institute in Clinton Hill, Brooklyn, Kelly Cho lived in the dorms. In her second year, she moved nearby with a good friend. The roommates chose a two-bedroom in a 2009 high-rise, 163 Washington, with a balcony and a washer-dryer. A Key Food supermarket was handy and Pratt was a seven-minute walk. They split the rent of $4,200 a month. In a new building, ""we didn't have to deal with plumbing issues and cockroaches,"" Ms. Cho said. In an old one, she worried that, even if renovated, structural issues and outdated heating and air-conditioning systems might be a problem.

Meanwhile, her boyfriend, Jaime Soriano, had graduated last May from Full Sail University in Florida with a degree in recording arts. Mr. Soriano, who is from Mexico City, headed to New York and is seeking an internship at a music or recording studio. Ms. Cho and Mr. Soriano, now both 22, decided to find a place together. The obvious plan was to downsize to a one-bedroom in Ms. Cho's building. But a new management company required a local guarantor or a year's rent in advance, Ms. Cho said. The one-bedroom available, for $3,000 a month, was on a low floor and seemed expensive for what it was. And the rapidly changing Clinton Hill area offered plenty of other options. With a budget of up to $3,000 a month, the two sought a cat-friendly one-bedroom within walking distance of Pratt. Ideally, they wouldn't need to give up a balcony or a washer-dryer. ""Everything we saw was more or less the same price,"" Mr. Soriano said, in the high $2,000-a-month range.

She also wanted a system for keeping deliveries safe. ""I've seen where they just leave packages in the hallway and other people will take them,"" she said. ""My friends have had that happen."" One obvious choice was the Refinery, a 2015 rental building on Myrtle Avenue conveniently atop the Key Food supermarket. ""That's where I do my grocery shopping with my Pratt student discount,"" Ms. Cho said. (Students receive 5 percent off.) From her balcony, she had watched the building rise, and she liked the landscaped roof deck. But no one-bedrooms were available -- just a studio for around $2,300 a month, which she and Mr. Soriano decided against. Visiting friends would have nowhere to sit but the bed. At brand-new 180 Franklin, they saw the amenities before they saw the one-bedrooms for rent. The gym didn't interest them, but a pool table and roof deck did. Ms. Cho liked the workroom with tables ""where you are allowed to cut things,"" she said. ""It is like it was made for architecture students."" There was a package room, too. Each apartment included a washer-dryer. But they still had more places to see. At yet another new building, the unit they viewed was strewn with trash, and Ms. Cho was leery of potential poor maintenance. At a building that was renovated rather than new, a lobby upgrade was planned. They didn't want to endure construction.",Kelly Cho and Jaime Soriano wanted a one-bedroom for them and their cat.,39c776cc-edd0-5d7d-b2d8-2565fc415d5f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/23/realestate/23HUNT-MAIN/23HUNT-MAIN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=21a59e528f46d20b0af19b931a79e4a7fe9196955a1e0256d407397518daceb4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,THE RENTERS Jaime Soriano and Kelly Cho with Taco,39c776cc-edd0-5d7d-b2d8-2565fc415d5f,N24News/imgs/39c776cc-edd0-5d7d-b2d8-2565fc415d5f.jpg,7
Books,Jenny Slate Wrote a Book-Shaped Thing. What Is It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/books/jenny-slate-little-weirds.html,"Jenny Slate's book ""Little Weirds"" is an intentional departure from her onscreen work. ""People had approached me like, 'Would you like to write some humorous blah-blah-blahs?'"" she said. ""And my answer was no, I don't think I can.""





SOUTH DARTMOUTH, Mass. -- The only piece of fiction in Jenny Slate's new book, ""Little Weirds,"" describes a love that grew old in an un-air-conditioned house by the Atlantic Ocean. ""I was trying to say goodbye to my ex-husband, who is an important person in my life and a friend,"" the actress and comedian said of the story, ""I Died: Bronze Tree."" After her divorce from the director Dean Fleischer-Camp in 2016, she heard that sometimes, as a healing exercise, trauma survivors reimagine painful experiences. ""I decided to write for myself what my life would be if I had a relationship that lasted till the end,"" she sa id. Maybe this isn't what you were expecting from Slate, who is known for voicing animated characters in television shows like ""Big Mouth"" and ""Bob's Burgers,"" as well as the internet's favorite anthropomorphic shell, Marcel. Nor is it what you might have assumed would emerge from the mind of the stand-up comedian whose monologues are punctuated by ""poop and fart jokes,"" as she put it, among other bodily concerns. But ""Little Weirds"" wasn't really meant to be funny. ""People had approached me like, 'Would you like to write some humorous blah-blah-blahs?'"" Slate said. ""And my answer was no, I don't think I can.""

She proposed an allegorical eco-feminist tome that she imagined would be in the vein of bell hooks. That didn't work out, either. The book Slate did write, which Little, Brown will release on Nov. 5, is more autobiographical than sociological or critical, but it doesn't quite fall into the category of personal essays. The word ""divorce"" only appears a few times in its pages. Disclosures are often cushioned by whimsical rhetorical devices. Proper nouns, even the name of her dog, have been largely left out. She writes about nurture and nourishment: returning to the (almost certainly haunted) house where she grew up; drinking a beer alone in the airport; saying hello to the dog first, and the human second, if at all; admiring the ferocity of other women; watching the solar eclipse in a crowd of strangers; picking the perfect flower to fill her window boxes. You might call them personal abstractions. ""Little Weirds"" has retained some of its original feminist underpinnings, in its reverence for nature and the female body, and its condemnation of male arrogance. Slate, who is 37 and was raised in the Boston suburb of Milton, said she couldn't have written like this in her 20s. ""Even though I grew up in a privileged situation -- I went to private school, and my parents are both artists, and I had access to a lot of literature and art, and I had a really caring family and good health and safety -- I don't really feel like anybody directly spoke to me about feminism,"" she said. ""I didn't understand that it was important to say directly that you are a feminist, and I didn't know what it meant."" It wasn't until she was cast in the 2014 film ""Obvious Child,"" which revolves around a comedian's unplanned pregnancy, that she came to understand the relationship between her body, her voice and the rest of the world. She credits her feminist awakening to that film's director, Gillian Robespierre. They have become serial collaborators, ever since Robespierre identified something sensitive about Slate's stand-up.

""I think a lot of really dramatic actors cannot do comedy,"" Robespierre said, ""but I do think there are more comedic actors and comedians who can perform difficult scenes and go to those deeper, darker places onscreen in a natural way.""

Slate, a self-described ""moderately successful actress,"" has leaned more comedic than dramatic in her career. But every now and then she gets a casting call that defies any notions she has about her range, like the time she was asked to read for the role of Pennywise in the film adaptation of Stephen King's ""It."" ""I had to put my computer across the room and look at it with binoculars and be like, 'Sorry, I'm so sorry,'"" she said, recalling her incredulity at the email. Then she began to envision a world in which she got the part. ""Do I have boobs as female It?"" she wondered. This week Slate released her first comedy special, ""Stage Fright,"" on Netflix. The feature cuts from a stand-up set at New York's Gramercy Theater to documentary-style interviews with Slate's parents, Nancy and Ron, and her sisters, Abby and Stacey. (Her grandmothers make memorable appearances, too.)

In the Netflix special Slate also shares artifacts from her childhood: the Laura Ashley wallpaper, the debate trophies, the hex-like poems scribbled on the walls of her closet, cursing the classmates who wronged her. There's a wistful and resigned quality to it all -- she expresses doubt that she will amount to anything other than a ""weird aunt"" in a world full of disappointing men. ""Little Weirds,"" like many books published since 2016, makes dutiful references to Donald Trump and the reverberations of his election, though none so explicit as the ones Slate makes in conversation, about the proliferation of hate speech, violence and restrictive gender-based laws.

""When Gabe Liedman, my comedy partner, and I first started doing comedy, we felt really free to use language that were slurs against women or Jews or gay people, because we felt that that empowered us,"" Slate said. ""And now it's like, I don't want to hear that at all. We are in an emergency, and you can't use that language because it's all flammable."" Since April, Slate has been living, mostly without air-conditioning, in the childhood home of her fiance, Ben Shattuck. The couple also spends time on Cuttyhunk Island, located off Cape Cod, where Shattuck is the director of a writers' residency and where Slate in June gave a widely covered speech to the island's one graduating eighth-grader. She spends her time reading, writing, swimming in the river behind their house on the South Coast of Massachusetts and napping, as Shattuck, who is also a painter and a curator, has taught her to enjoy. Sometimes they drive his mother's Prius an hour into Providence, R.I., the nearest city, for dinner and a movie. When they are together, Slate seems most herself; she talks about missing her parents, who live a close-but-far ferry ride away, on Martha's Vineyard, and reminisces about the time Rihanna complimented her on her dress. She and Shattuck met two summers ago through a series of meaningful coincidences that brought them north of the Arctic Circle . Slate had flown to Norway to celebrate the 30th birthday of the author Rebecca Dinerstein Knight, whom she met in Brooklyn's Cobble Hill Park, in 2014. ""I had just seen 'Obvious Child,' and I was walking home through the park and I recognized Jenny. She was on the phone, and I gave her this incredibly ridiculous, silent round of applause as I walked by her,"" Dinerstein Knight said. ""She blew me a kiss. And that was the whole exchange."" They connected that evening on Twitter and began an email correspondence. Dinerstein Knight sent Slate a copy of her first novel, ""The Sunlit Night,"" to read. Which brings us back to Norway. After the celebrations, they planned to visit Lofoten, the archipelago where ""The Sunlit Night"" is set, to scout locations for its film adaptation starring Slate. Dinerstein Knight and her husband, John Knight, invited his best friend to join them. Shattuck appears anonymously midway through ""Little Weirds ."" He and Slate talk about poetry. He roasts chicken, bakes an apple pie. She sees his butt. ""Nobody touched me,"" she writes, ""but it felt like I had been touched.""

Your Money,Weighing the Best Vehicles For Philanthropic Giving,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/your-money/asset-allocation/29wealth.html,"KEN NOPAR, who advises others about philanthropy, will face his own decision on charitable giving when his parents die. Should he and his brother keep their parents' private foundation going or transfer the assets into a donor-advised fund, where they have less control over how the money is invested and given away? This is a question many philanthropically inclined people are asking themselves in the aftermath of the financial crisis and increased Internal Revenue Service scrutiny of private foundations. Betsy Brill, president of Strategic Philanthropy, an advisory firm in Chicago, said the number of new private foundations had decreased over the last few years. One obvious reason is the downturn in the economy, which has meant fewer instances like the lucrative sale of a private company or a big stock position. Those events often persuade people to put money into a foundation. But existing foundations have experienced such a decline in the value of their assets that it sometimes does not make sense to keep them running, she said. In that case, the trustees may opt to convert the foundations to a donor-advised fund, which are less expensive to run but have more limitations.

Mr. Nopar, who works at Strategic Philanthropy, said he might have to wrestle with that prospect in the future. He said the biggest question was what his parents, who are in their 80s, want him and his brother to do. ""I've gotten involved in the last few years, but before that it was really my parents' decision,"" he said. While the foundation has been around for 20 years, he stressed that it was not large. It has been a way for his parents to make modest grants to many charities. Mr. Nopar's choices are exactly what anyone thinking about creating a vehicle for charitable giving should consider. After all, how you help favored causes could be as much a part of your legacy as which groups you support. CONTROL Having a say over where your money goes and how it is distributed is important to many people. A private foundation gives much more control than a donor-advised fund. With a fund, the donor is technically only making recommendations to a firm managing and distributing the money. (Fidelity, Schwab and Vanguard have large donor-advised fund businesses.)

Practically speaking, a donor's suggestions are usually not ignored. But one important thing you cannot do with a fund is make pledge agreements to, say, your alma mater, said Drew McMorrow, senior client adviser at Ballentine Partners, a wealth manager. ""You can't do that in a binding way from a donor-advised fund because you're not technically controlling that fund,"" he said. Control often goes beyond where grants are made. There is also the question of how the assets are invested, which you can control only in a foundation. ""A lot of people who create these foundations have made their money through investing,"" said Joanne E. Johnson, managing director of the wealth advisory practice at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. ""They have some acumen on the investing side, and they don't want to be relegated to an asset allocation that is a series of mutual funds."" Of course, even with a foundation, the level of control is never unfettered. ""The I.R.S. doesn't want you to use these things as piggy banks,"" said John Dadakis, a partner at the law firm Holland & Knight. ""One needs to be very careful in administering a private foundation."" A classic example is using a private foundation to buy tickets to a gala and then giving those tickets away to friends. People need to be aware that self-dealing is not allowed.

There are no hard and fast rules to determine when a foundation is more cost-effective. Ms. Johnson said you need at least $1 million, while Mr. Dadakis said he recommended a minimum of $10 million. There are several reasons for this. For one, a private foundation needs to give away at least 5 percent of its assets each year; a donor-advised fund does not. And a foundation also needs to earn enough on its investments to cover administrative costs, which, Ms. Johnson said, could total up to 8 percent a year. Another big issue is the size of the tax deduction. It is much higher for a donor-advised fund, with a 50 percent tax write-off for cash donations and a 30 percent one for securities. This is because these funds are considered public charities. For a private foundation, the deduction is 30 percent for cash and 20 percent for securities. ""The donor-advised fund makes it a lot easier for administration and it takes the burden off of the family to keep minutes and file"" the required I.R.S. forms, Mr. Dadakis said. PRIVACY Many documents about foundations are readily available on the Internet. GuideStar, a database on nonprofit groups, publishes I.R.S. filings, annual reports and even the private foundation's board members. Anyone can also search certain criteria, such as where a nonprofit group has given money. Beyond a criminal using your personal information for nefarious reasons, charities can take this information and put you in an awkward position. ""I had a client who enrolled his child in a preschool and within a month of enrolling their child, the development director had approached them to make a grant of $100,000,"" Mr. McMorrow said.

The client was taken aback, Mr. McMorrow said, because the size of the gift was consistent with what he had given to schools his other children had attended. The client had not realized how easy it was to get the information online. ""They ultimately consented to a gift that was lower and structured over a few years,"" Mr. McMorrow said. ""They didn't feel they could say no."" In this case, the school was savvier than the donor, but no one wants to be put in a position of being pressured, even if it is for charity. A simple solution for those setting up a private foundation is to avoid naming it after themselves and then have all inquiries sent to a lawyer or adviser. Privacy concerns could also be a reason to consider a donor-advised fund. It would still be possible to see the amount of money that went into the fund, but not possible to see how that money was distributed. LEGACY Of course, there are reasons that go well beyond charitable giving that factor into the decision to create a foundation or to use a donor-advised fund or other charitable vehicle. Status is the obvious one, but legacy is another. Ms. Brill said people needed to ask how long they wanted their giving to go on. Some want to give their money away before they die. Charles Feeney, who made his fortune as a founder of duty-free shops, is a case in point.","As private foundations attract more I.R.S. scrutiny, some wealthy philanthropists are considering the benefits of donor-advised funds, which are also less costly to manage.",3fc4042e-eadc-5704-914b-074bf91ca7ae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/01/29/your-money/asset-allocation/29wealth-inline/29wealth-inline-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=6a320eaa846a3550e8fd5b2e7d7196140b2842d848fc8bb2adace7fe702f7e64&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joanne E.

Economy,Lines Blur in U.S.-Europe Debate on Austerity,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/business/economy/for-g-8-meeting-talk-of-economy-but-syria-looms-large.html,"As President Obama begins an annual meeting with the leaders of some of the world's richest nations on Monday in Northern Ireland, the economic-policy gulf that has divided them since the global crash in 2008 has narrowed significantly -- just not exactly in ways that the White House would have liked. The Europeans lately have slightly eased their austerity policies, after four years of deep spending cuts and rising taxes that many economists blame for keeping the Continent in recession long after America's ended. And the Obama administration, after years of pressing Europe to adopt American-style stimulus measures, is now presiding -- if reluctantly -- over European-style austerity that is measurably slowing its recovery. Much of that austerity is in the form of across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration that were forced by Republicans in Congress. But Mr. Obama supported an end this year to both a temporary payroll-tax cut, which the Congressional Budget Office and private analysts credited with spurring consumer spending and creating jobs, and the Bush-era income tax cuts for the wealthy. What stimulus remains in the American economy can be credited to the expansionary monetary policies of the independent Federal Reserve System.

That new reality in the United States reduces the president's already limited leverage in his fiscal debate with Europeans, analysts on both sides of the Atlantic say, even as Europe's woes continue to act as a drag on its trading partners, including the United States. ""President Obama will continue trying to lead by persuasion rather than by example,"" said Eswar Shanker Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and a former official of the International Monetary Fund. ""The U.S. is likely to push other countries towards adopting measures to support growth, including a slowdown in the drive for fiscal austerity, but against the backdrop of its own premature fiscal tightening."" With the United States ""just beginning to solidify its recovery, the last thing it needs right now is a major shock emanating from Europe,"" Mr. Prasad added. ""But the reality is that the U.S. can only jawbone. It cannot really influence policies in any substantive way."" American and European officials said in interviews that arguments over austerity versus stimulus, so prominent at international gatherings in recent years, are likely to be muted at the two-day summit conference of the Group of 8 industrialized countries that is being held at the lakeside Lough Erne resort in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland. Besides Mr. Obama, participants include the leaders of Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia -- countries that account for about half of the world's economic activity. The reduced emphasis on stimulus versus austerity occurs even as unemployment remains at double digits in much of Europe, stoking unrest especially among the young. In part it reflects the fact that this spring, in advance of the summit conference, Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew and his counterparts among European financial ministers hashed out their differences so the heads of state could focus elsewhere. Also, the Group of 8 agenda is set by the gathering's host -- for this meeting, the conservative and pro-austerity prime minister of Britain, David Cameron.

Yet even Mr. Cameron's agenda, on international taxation, tax transparency and trade, is likely to be overshadowed by the allies' intensifying debate over whether and how to intervene in Syria's worsening civil war. That likelihood was suggested late Friday by a summary from Mr. Cameron's Downing Street office about his pre-summit videoconference with Mr. Obama, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, President Francois Hollande of France and Prime Minister Enrico Letta of Italy. They discussed ""how G-8 countries should all agree to work together on a political transition to end the conflict"" in Syria, according to the statement from London. But significantly, the call did not include President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, Syria's most important ally and arms provider.

Administration officials say that Mr. Obama is likely to make his most fulsome economic arguments against Europe's continued emphasis on budget cutting -- and for the relatively successful American model -- after the Group of 8 meeting, when he flies to Germany. On Wednesday he is to be in Berlin for a state visit with Ms. Merkel. The German chancellor, as the leader of Europe's biggest and strongest economy, has had an outsize influence on the economic direction of the European Union. She and the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, have insisted that Greece, Portugal and other so-called peripheral economies among the 17 European Union nations that use the euro must continue to cut their budgets and to restructure costly labor, health and retirement programs for long-term fiscal stability. Providing additional bailouts without such budget pressure would only encourage further profligacy, the Germans contend, and it could set off inflation.

* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. Germany recently acquiesced, however, to give France, Portugal, Italy and Spain two more years to reduce their deficits to the European Union's target, freeing them to perhaps loosen spending and cut taxes in the short term with the aim of increasing consumer demand and business activity. The administration, while applauding the concession, would have preferred that the Germans had instead allowed the other countries to increase their deficits, not just delay their deficit reductions. Mr. Prasad, the international economist, said Mr. Obama would have ""a tough sell"" with Ms. Merkel. ""But I think even Merkel has come around to the view that pushing too hard on fiscal policy in the short term is going to be potentially counterproductive,"" he added. ""The complication is that she faces elections in the fall, and the notion of continuing to subsidize the euro zone periphery economies is not something that would sell in Germany.""

At the Group of 8, the opening session is for discussing the global economy. Previewing the summit meeting on Friday, Caroline Atkinson, Mr. Obama's chief adviser for the event, acknowledged that ""the context for that discussion has changed a lot over the past year,"" given economic developments in both Europe and the United States. ""In Europe, for example, financial tensions have eased considerably, but large parts of Europe remain in recession and unemployment in some countries is at record highs,"" Ms. Atkinson said. ""In the U.S., our recovery is under way. We've successfully avoided the fiscal cliff and our budget deficit is declining rapidly. But of course we have more work to do to create jobs."" She added, ""We expect that G-8 leaders will express a consensus that growth and jobs are a top priority."" The problem is that the Americans and the European leaders continue to define what produces growth in different ways -- differences that have a parallel in the domestic debate between Mr. Obama and Republican lawmakers. Ms. Merkel and Mr. Cameron say that reducing deficits and debt to reassure lenders eventually will bring growth. The Americans say that the United States' recovery shows that, in a crisis, stimulus should come first and deficit reduction can follow once growth is restored. ""If Europe had done like we did, they may not be in the situation they're in,"" said Tony Fratto, a Treasury official during the George W. Bush administration. ""Europe went straight to austerity before growth,"" he added. ""They're actually still in a sustained recession -- and in some countries it's a sustained depression."" The European Union's top economic policy maker, Olli Rehn, has signaled a softening of austerity recently as a long-promised recovery failed to materialize. But in an interview last week, the European Commission president, Jose Manuel Barroso, seemed to rule out a program of economic stimulus. Mr. Barroso challenged calls by Washington and also by many in Europe for a retreat from policies of austerity. ""Let's not forget why we came to this situation: in many cases because of high levels of public debt and we have seen that growth fueled by debt is simply not sustainable,"" he said.",A long-running economic policy debate over austerity versus stimulus was expected to be muted at the Group of 8 summit as participants concentrated on addressing the escalating civil war in Syria.,3fddef4f-2ba9-5223-90ac-5728f16f4533,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/17/business/austerityjump/austerityjump-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=386&w=600&s=228756ef87615660f7cce33beb5192da5eb3088017c0913feac1947cdfdb3c41&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Protesters rallied last week against government-imposed austerity measures and labor reforms in public health care in Madrid.,3fddef4f-2ba9-5223-90ac-5728f16f4533,N24News/imgs/3fddef4f-2ba9-5223-90ac-5728f16f4533.jpg,8
Art & Design,"Former Contractor Sues Dale Chihuly, Claiming He Helped Create Artwork",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/dale-chihuly-artwork-lawsuit-michael-moi.html,"Dale Chihuly, the artist whose show of 20 glass art installations is on display spread across the 250 acres of the New York Botanical Garden, used a group of unpaid assistants for 15 years to create works that were attributed solely to him, a man claimed in a lawsuit filed on Friday in Seattle. In an unusually detailed answer and counterclaim, Mr. Chihuly's lawyers also on Friday told of the artist's deteriorating mental state, and said the lawsuit was ""nothing more than an ugly and reprehensible display of opportunism and exploitation"" by the man, who the lawyers said was seeking money to keep quiet about the artist's condition. The lawsuit was filed by a former contractor, Michael Moi, who said he first met the artist through a shared acquaintance, did construction work for him and eventually participated in ""myriad clandestine painting sessions."" It names as defendants Mr. Chihuly, 75; his wife, Leslie Chihuly; and Chihuly Studio Inc., and asks for a finding that Mr. Moi is a co-author of certain works and owns an interest in them. ""The artist has long relied on a collection of discreet and trusted individuals to work in the shadows to create the drawings and paintings on paper glass plexiglass and canvas that bear his name,"" the suit claims. ""This small group which has never been acknowledged has two requirements: secrecy and unwavering loyalty.""

In the counterclaim, Mr. Chihuly said he had long used assistants to help him execute his artistic vision, but denied that Mr. Moi, whom he described as ""a handyman,"" had been one of them. Instead, Mr. Chihuly's lawyers wrote, Mr. Moi had threatened to expose embarrassing information about the artist unless his demands for money were met. Mr. Chihuly's lawyers wrote that the artist had been diagnosed with ""bipolar disorder, symptoms of which include depression, hyperactivity and/or mania, paranoia, impaired judgment and irrational behavior,"" something that was rarely discussed publicly because his family and friends wanted to shield him from the ""often cruel and judgmental glare of public scrutiny."" Mr. Moi, the countersuit said, possessed confidential documents that supposedly reflect Mr. Chihuly's personal struggles. ""Under the thin guise of this litigation, Mr. Moi is threatening to make such documents public as purported 'evidence' in his lawsuit unless Dale, his family, and Chihuly Inc. pay him $21 million for his silence,"" according to the countersuit.

For years it has been common for artists to employ groups of assistants whose tasks ranged from stretching canvases to maintaining archives to supplying materials. Some artists, such as Andy Warhol or Jeff Koons -- who once told an interviewer that he was ""an idea person"" -- have employed assistants who had a direct hand in creating paintings or sculptures, sometimes even being paid an hourly wage and functioning like members of an assembly line to produce works that later sell for hundreds of thousands of dollars or more. The lawsuit filed by Mr. Moi describes a less formal arrangement, saying he was never paid by Mr. Chihuly, became an employee or signed any type of work for hire agreement. Rather, the suit claims, Mr. Chihuly ""repeatedly and consistently"" promised him future compensation, saying that his studio kept careful records, and that he would at some point ""take care of him"" which Mr. Moi took to mean that his share of the profits of works they had created would be ascertained and awarded. By most measures, Mr. Chihuly -- whose work is in more than 200 museums around the world and who is known for large public exhibitions, and for a 1986 solo show at the Louvre in Paris -- and Mr. Moi would seem to make an odd team. Mr. Moi's lawsuit said the two got to know each other in 1999 aboard Mr. Chihuly's boat, the Meteor, which was captained by Billy O'Neill, a mutual acquaintance. Mr. O'Neill eventually became Mr. Chihuly's assistant, the lawsuit said, and Mr. Moi was hired to repair roofs on houses owned by Mr. Chihuly. Before long, Mr. Moi's lawsuit states, he began receiving phone calls from assistants including Mr. O'Neill asking him to take part in ""frequent and impromptu painting sessions."" The lawsuit described that process: Mr. Moi and Mr. O'Neill would pour paint onto lines of heavy stock French watercolor paper arranged on floors. Mr. Moi would then use foam mops to create the background and body of pieces. Mr. Chihuly would follow, adding dots, drip and lines and, finally, his signature. Later, the suit said, Mr. Moi used a blowtorch to ""'burn' thick layers of paint and metallic dust"" onto works being created by Mr. Chihuly. By 2012, the lawsuit said, Mr. Moi began working on plexiglass paintings at the Chihuly studio. At that point, Mr. Chihuly played no part in the creative process, the lawsuit said, adding that his role was confined to signing finished pieces. Mr. O'Neill was fired from the studio in early 2015, the lawsuit said, and, around the same time, Mr. Moi's contact with Mr. Chihuly trailed off. He was later told that a new group of assistants had been hired, the suit claimed, saying he then realized that ""neither Chihuly nor the Chihuly studio was going to compensate him for his years of painting work as promised.""","Michael Moi claims he is a co-author of certain works, while Mr. Chihuly's lawyers say he is trying to exploit the artist's deteriorating mental state.",8df5f8ab-c367-52a8-8e83-2ad0d3fa1ec7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/43Chihuly2/03Chihuly1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=c1edf126500eddce01c4e55a8ee9fdd6124c596cc9d635f256d171d633775a9c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The artist Dale Chihuly in 2006 in Seattle.

At 16 feet tall, the figure is a black woman with cornrows and a dome-shaped torso that resembles a skirtlike house. It is by far the largest sculpture Ms. Leigh has created; even among the sea of skyscrapers and industrial-era brick buildings near the High Line, ""Brick House"" stands out. In an interview with The New York Times last summer, Ms. Leigh said she thought the commission ""would be a great opportunity to have something about black beauty right in the middle of that environment.""

Real Estate,Shopping for Outdoor Accent Tables,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/realestate/shopping-for-outdoor-accent-tables.html,"Lounge chairs get all the attention when it comes to shopping for outdoor furniture. But without a side table nearby, it's hard to enjoy lounging.

Other reasons you might want a small table outside? ""You can add an outdoor lantern or lamp,"" Mr. Williams said. ""Or a garden ornament or beautiful flower arrangement,"" to decorate your outdoor space.

Some outdoor accent tables are also strong enough to function as additional seating when you entertain (and may be marketed as multifunctional stool-tables).

Food,What to Cook This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/07/dining/what-to-cook-this-week.html,"Happily, I'm home now, and Sundays, IMHO, are made for reclaiming the kitchen, both to cook for tonight and to get a jump-start on the week ahead.

This evening, we've been tasked with taking dinner to a friend's house. They are supplying the pre-dinner nibbles and dessert, and I'm supplying the main course. It needs to be kid-friendly, and dairy- and gluten-free. (Sound familiar?) So I'm thinking chicken because everyone loves it, especially when it's been marinated in fresh za'atar herbs and tons of garlic and lemon, then grilled. I can serve the yogurt on the side.

Another great option for a Sunday supper, though not gluten-free, is Sam Sifton's take on the Oxford, Miss., chef John Currence's Coke-brined fried chicken, which is supremely crunchy and very lightly sweet. Either dish would go well with some herb-flecked basmati rice pilaf and a crisp spinach salad.

Looking to the week ahead, here are several simple weeknight dishes that are staples in my house, like this baked fish and chips. Even my 8-year-old will eat it, at least most of the time (oh, those fickle developing palates). Pea shoots are just coming into season, and you can't go wrong turning them into pesto and smearing it all over seared brawny pork chops. Or, if lamb chops are more your speed, David Tanis has a great flavor-packed new recipe for lamb chops with ramps, anchovies, capers and olives. Or, try this oldie but goody by Pierre Franey, seared Portuguese-style chicken breasts with sweet peppers, tomatoes and spices. Read the cooking notes for this one: People have had great ideas for varying the dish, like adding olives and orange zest. It's a perfect example of cooks helping other cooks, which is always a good thing when it comes to dinner.

Or if you're doing the bulk of your cooking today, and want to make some things to keep in the fridge, you won't go wrong with cooking up a pot of this hearty turkey ragu, which you can use for pasta later in the week. Or get your noodle fix tonight with Fuchsia Dunlop's Shanghai stir-fried noodles with pork and baby bok choy. Then reheat the leftovers later in the week by refrying them in a hot pan with a little oil and a dash of hot sauce. They get more crisp the second time around, and are just as delicious.","Chicken marinated in za'atar, herb-flecked basmati rice, or even a turkey ragù: Find comfort in cooking in the days ahead.",3477a9cb-f37e-5f3a-8c9c-6041e29d11db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/10/multimedia/clark-chicken-thighs/clark-chicken-thighs-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ef6ac0328895c6901bd3bcd0393ad0f3dc059cebad1da747f55b4034d33670d1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Chicken with fresh za'atar herbs.,3477a9cb-f37e-5f3a-8c9c-6041e29d11db,N24News/imgs/3477a9cb-f37e-5f3a-8c9c-6041e29d11db.jpg,17
Travel,"Airlines Drop Cuba Flights, Citing Lower Demand Than Anticipated",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/13/travel/airlines-reduce-flights-to-cuba-and-switch-to-smaller-planes.html,"Just six months after being the first airline to sell seats on regularly scheduled flights to Cuba, Silver Airways, a regional carrier based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., that specializes in smaller markets, will scrap its service to the island next month. It is the latest industry move to underscore that fewer Americans are traveling to Cuba than originally anticipated. Citing low demand and competition from major airlines, Silver said it would cease its operations in Cuba effective April 22. The move follows other reductions by American Airlines and JetBlue, which in recent weeks either switched to smaller aircraft or cut back on the number of flights. Experts say the changes in the young market illustrate not so much a lack of passengers, but the rush of airlines into new territory with an abundance of seats the market could not possibly fill. ""Other airlines continue to serve this market with too many flights and oversized aircraft, which has led to an increase in capacity of approximately 300 percent between the U.S. and Cuba,"" said Misty Pinson, the director of communications for Silver. ""It is not in the best interest of Silver and its team members to behave in the same irrational manner as other airlines."" Also this month, Denver-based Frontier Airlines said that it would cease its daily flight to Havana from Miami on June 4. The airline said costs in Havana significantly exceeded initial assumptions, ""market conditions failed to materialize"" and too much capacity had been allocated between Florida and Cuba.

Regularly scheduled passenger jet service to Cuba had been cut off for more than 50 years. Americans who wanted to go there had to go through third countries or take expensive charter flights that were notorious for long delays and steep baggage fees. President Barack Obama renewed diplomatic relations with Cuba in 2015, and then brought back commercial airline travel last year. The companies that were authorized by the Department of Transportation booked routes not just to Havana, but also to less traveled cities such as Manzanillo and Holguin. With no history of commercial airline traffic to judge by, the airlines were largely guessing how many United States citizens and Cubans would line up for tickets. United Airlines has service from Newark and Houston, and Alaska Airlines flies to Havana from Los Angeles. Delta offers three daily flights to Havana from Atlanta, Miami and Kennedy International Airport in New York. Destinations like Santa Clara proved to be less popular than the airlines had hoped, and some were forced to scale back. ""We started pretty big in Cuba,"" said Laura Masvidal, a spokeswoman for American Airlines. ""We made some adjustments to adjust to the market demand."" Until February, American Airlines offered 1,920 seats a day to Cuba. The number dropped last month to 1,472, a nearly 25 percent reduction. The airline cut flights to Holguin, Santa Clara and Varadero to one daily flight from two, Ms. Masvidal said.

JetBlue Airways, which on Aug. 31 was the first to fly to Cuba, still offers nearly 50 weekly round-trip flights between the United States and four Cuban cities, but the airline recently switched to smaller planes. Silver Airways has been flying 22 flights a week with smaller aircraft to nine Cuban destinations other than the capital, including Santa Clara, Holguin and Cayo Coco. Demand, Ms. Pinson said, was depressed by complications with online travel agency distribution and code-share agreements that still have not been resolved. The airline had already tried reducing its offerings. The airline's decision comes even as passenger traffic to Cuba is actually increasing at a brisk pace. ""The market is exploding,"" said Chad Olin, the president of Cuba Candela, which specializes in booking trips to Cuba for the millennial traveler. ""There is some demand adjustment happening as well, but net outcome is still one of the fastest growing markets in global tourism history."" And to hear the Cuban government media tell it, Americans interested in visiting Cuba were triggered by a message that told everyone to ""travel now."" The number of Americans who visited Cuba was up 125 percent in January, compared with the same month last year, the government reported, calling it a ""virtual stampede."" Americans, the report said, were prompted by President Trump's administration calling for a total review of the Cuba policies enacted by Mr. Obama. Under the administration of George W. Bush, Cuban-Americans were limited to how often they could visit their families, so that niche also had a 38 percent increase, the Cuban media report said.

But it was still not enough to fill the flights. ""I think that a lot of airlines thought that there would be more demand than there is,"" said Paul Berry, a spokesman for Spirit airlines, which flies twice a day to Havana from Fort Lauderdale. ""Loads are not very heavy."" Mr. Berry said there are still glitches, including not being able to easily use American credit cards. The landing fees alone, Mr. Berry said, are sometimes more expensive than the actual airfare. American citizens are still required to report which of the 12 authorized types of travel they are undertaking, which could also be limiting the number of potential passengers, he said.",Silver Airways and Frontier Airlines are just the latest to reassess tourism to the island.,c1d549c2-fe1f-52d7-b409-0faa1f1fa041,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/13/travel/13CUBA/13CUBA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=11200a046a96919456972034378eb34e494c55cdefb9cec8e8682f82e311ab0c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"El Capitolio (the National Capitol Building) in Havana, a popular tourist attraction.

Dance,'The Golden Cockerel' Is a Ballet Bird With a Kick,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/arts/dance/the-golden-cockerel-american-ballet-theater.html,"It's almost a cliche to say that a ballerina's arms suggest wings -- the technique of ballet itself lends itself to metaphors of lightness and flight. Its repertory is filled with creatures of the air: melancholy swans, magical firebirds, charming bluebirds, even butterflies. This season, American Ballet Theater introduces yet another feathered creature to its menagerie, the gold-plumed rooster in Alexei Ratmansky's ""The Golden Cockerel."" ""The Golden Cockerel"" opens midway through a season in which Mr. Ratmansky's works dominate the repertory. By July, eight of his ballets will have been performed on the Met stage. But, as the recent revival of his 2012 ""Firebird"" underscored, his idea of birdlike movement doesn't necessarily coincide with the familiar 19th-century image of fluid arms, delicate necks and fluttering feet. This is even more true of his ""Golden Cockerel."" ""The movement is almost mechanical,"" Mr. Ratmansky said recently at the company's studios, ""very strong, brilliant and sharp, with fast changes of focus."" In a rehearsal, Skylar Brandt, one of four dancers performing the title role, slid forward several feet on her pointes, then folded her arms back at her sides and flickered her elbows quickly, almost like mechanical winglets, and finally bent forward at a right angle, jerkily, like a marionette. Later she skittered across the studio in a series of blisteringly fast backward-traveling leaps; again, the impression was both brilliant and almost frighteningly inhuman.

Mr. Ratmansky's golden bird has a long history, onstage and in the literary imagination. He (a cockerel is a young rooster, though he's danced here by a woman) is merely the most recent incarnation of a character that first appeared in a folk tale by Alexander Pushkin. (Another rooster plays a bit part in Frederick Ashton's ""La Fille Mal Gardee,"" which just ended its run.) Pushkin began jotting down his old nursemaid's stories in the 1820s while in internal exile at the family estate. (He was being punished for his support of the Decembrist revolt against Czar Nicholas I.) Pushkin's tales, or skazki, are familiar to most Russian children, as they were to the young Mr. Ratmansky. (There is even a Soviet cartoon version, from 1967.) It's a strange story, in which the cockerel plays only a small but crucial part. A doddering old czar (Dodon) wants only to sleep. (""It is the Russian dream to do nothing and to sleep all the time!"" Mr. Ratmansky said. ""Don't forget, the winters in Russia are long."") His kingdom is attacked from all sides. An astrologer offers a solution: a golden cockerel who will crow whenever danger is nigh. After repeated warnings, Dodon marches off to battle a kingdom to the east, where he encounters a beautiful princess. He falls madly in love and decides to make her his wife. When the astrologer demands the princess as his prize, Dodon kills him. Then, in a magical reversal, the cockerel springs to life and kills the czar. In Mr. Ratmansky's version, she lands on the czar's shoulders and pecks him to death. (No, she's not your usual bashful swan.) ""It's really fun to kill someone onstage,"" Cassandra Trenary, one of the dancers performing the role, said after rehearsal.

The moral is hard to unravel. What does it mean? In part, Pushkin's tale was meant to poke fun at the folly of kings, a perennial Russian subject. But, contrary to appearances, ""The Golden Cockerel"" didn't start as a Russian story. Rather, it's an adaptation of a tale by Washington Irving from his ""Tales of the Alhambra"" (1832). It is both a satire and, like the Irving version, an exotic fable in which magic plays a big part. ""There is this interesting relationship between the astrologer and the queen,"" Mr. Ratmansky explained. ""They are both magicians; they come from the same dimension somehow.""

The story's political undercurrent lingered in the 1907 opera it inspired. Composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, it is a cartoonish political satire dressed up as a fairy tale, in which he pushed his usual musical language -- highly colored instrumentation, sinuous melodies, folk motifs -- to a parodic extreme. ""The Russia depicted in this opera is a caricature,"" the Princeton musicologist Simon Morrison said in a phone interview, adding that the composer ""contrasts this with a fantasy space of the exotic east."" In other words, nothing in ""Golden Cockerel"" feels remotely real. Still, the content was troubling enough to alarm the censors and delay its premiere. The opera opened in Moscow in 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death and was picked up a few years later by the Ballets Russes. In that version, from 1914, staged by Michel Fokine, the story was acted out by dancers while the singers and chorus sat in tiers on either side of the stage. The separation of the voice from the body made the similarity to puppet theater even more apparent. Fokine's take was also less political, not ""a satire on royalty,"" he wrote in his memoirs, ""but on human frailty and weakness in general."" His characters were puppetlike, in the style of Russian folk art, echoed by the production's spectacular designs, by the avant-garde painter Natalya Goncharova: brilliantly colored, vehemently two-dimensional, almost childlike. Richard Hudson's designs for the current production are based on Goncharova's, though not as exuberant. ""I simplified some of the backcloths,"" he explained in an email from London, ""to achieve a clear, sharp, coherent stage picture."" In 1937, Fokine created a new, one-act, pure-dance version, without singers. (The designs, again, were by Goncharova.) The cockerel, which had been represented by a prop bird, was now a ballerina on pointe. Extended excerpts were captured on film. (You can see them at the Public Library for the Performing Arts.) Fast forward to 2012, when the Royal Danish Ballet asked Mr. Ratmansky to create a new work for the company. He was intrigued by the lore surrounding the Fokine staging. ""The first knock on the door for me was that Fokine said it's his best ballet,"" said Mr. Ratmansky, who expresses a great love of ballet history. ""I thought, it must be a very special thing."" He went back to watch the footage from the 1930s production and was persuaded to give it a try. His own version quotes just a few of Fokine's movements, particularly in the sharp, jerky choreography for the cockerel. They are like a salute to the ballet's past. Mr. Ratmansky's two-act ballet opened to mixed reviews in Copenhagen in 2012; critics lauded the designs and the characterizations, but some complained that there wasn't enough dancing. For American Ballet Theater, Mr. Ratmansky has added more. Even so, there is more mime than most contemporary audiences are accustomed to, all in the interest of conveying the fantastical story. The political subtext is not emphasized. ""I mean, what do I do, put Putin makeup on the king?"" Mr. Ratmansky asked, with a wry laugh. ""I wish I could be more daring in that sense, but I don't see how I can translate that. For me, it's about the music and visuals and characters.""",Alexei Ratmansky reanimates a gold-plumed character with a long history onstage and in the literary imagination.,bc471133-f348-53ee-a6a6-b4b4019b3680,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/05/arts/05COQD-OR5/05COQD-OR5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=534bb3c7d6ceb5b7027858c227bc6c14df8e720068a647fa6b137ad17c65c3b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Duncan Lyle, left, and Skylar Brandt in ""The Golden Cockerel.""",bc471133-f348-53ee-a6a6-b4b4019b3680,N24News/imgs/bc471133-f348-53ee-a6a6-b4b4019b3680.jpg,6
Travel,Chicago Theaters Cultivate Night Life Offstage,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/travel/chicago-theaters-nightlife-restaurants-entertainment.html,"On a spring evening last year, shortly after Steppenwolf Theater in Chicago opened an addition with a new theater and a lounge, the city's mayor Rahm Emanuel was possibly the only audience member not to hit the new bar. He remained in the lobby of the Lincoln Park venue while the cast members from two of the three theaters in the complex, one director and a healthy contingent of patrons headed off to order rum-based Balm in Gileads and bourbon East of Edens while discussing the performances. Another set of showgoers filed off, drinks in hand, for a late-night show featuring the actress Laurie Metcalf. Numbering more than 200 companies, ranging from shoestring storefronts to celebrity-founded heavyweights like Steppenwolf, Chicago theater groups are developing a taste for night life apart from the stage. New on-site restaurants and bars keep their audiences fed and watered in-house and sometimes offer opportunities to mingle with the talent. ""We're always talking about deeper engagement with the audience, and what better way is there than having a drink or a sandwich with them?"" said Deb Clapp, the executive director of the League of Chicago Theaters.

Perhaps driven by relatively affordable real estate -- as compared with Broadway -- and many transit options that mean patrons can skip driving in favor of drinking, Chicago theaters have adopted the practice in large and small venues across the city. Last May, Steppenwolf -- whose members include John Malkovich and Gary Sinise -- opened its third stage, an 80-seat black-box theater for intimate shows ranging from dance to spoken word. The extension also houses Front Bar, which was launched in consultation with the popular Boka restaurant group that operates a number of chef-driven establishments. It acts as a coffeehouse, open from 7 a.m., and serves porchetta sandwiches, arugula salads and margherita pizza slices through lunch and dinner. But it's the central rectangular bar, ringed with stools and open until midnight, that draws pre- and post-curtain cocktail crowds including audience members and actors. The ensemble had long wanted a bar in its expansion plans, said Anna D. Shapiro, the artistic director of Steppenwolf. ""What the bar/cafe offers is unprogrammed interaction with people who care about art as much as we do,"" she said.

Last March, the seminal improv comedy company Second City opened its own restaurant on its premises. Its name, 1959 Restaurant & Bar, references the year in which the troupe was founded. Farm-to-table fare on the seasonal menu has included beet and burrata salads and brisket sliders, and cocktails have appeared with clever names, including the Dark Comedy, described as ""Dark like your soul, refreshing like your hopes and dreams."" A golden bust of the late company member Harold Ramis greets diners as they approach the bar; and circular booths, tufted couches and high-top communal tables keep the setting casual. The dining addition was in the works for about three years, according to Andrew Alexander, the executive director of Second City. It equally serves audiences and students taking improv classes. ""It's really made it much more convenient in the winter, which as you know can be unpleasant here,"" Mr. Alexander said. ""It's a chance to mingle with your comedic heroes."" Two more acclaimed improv comedy companies, the Annoyance and iO Theater, operate adjoining bars that allow patrons to continue the revel, and possibly hobnob with the talent, post-curtain.

With a menu of wings and turkey wraps, the Annoyance does not get the traditional pretheater dinner crowd seeking sit-down meals and multiple courses. For that they partner with a local restaurant offering a precurtain menu. Instead, they get snackers and pull in drinkers with craft beers in an exposed brick barroom not far from Wrigley Field that feels more like a neighborhood stop than a theater adjunct. It also provides important alternative revenue. Food and beverage sales accounted for more than 42 percent of Annoyance's income last year, according to Jennifer Estlin, the executive producer of the company.",The city's strong theater community is increasingly keeping its audiences fed and watered in-house.,c07ddd74-222c-571e-9c27-505ec68ca272,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/05/travel/5HEADSUP1/5HEADSUP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=cc6c9318576119e59edf47a346a35737cb09100a08fc9d9da223b49a6da49057&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"1959 Restaurant & Bar, which opened at Second City in Chicago last spring.",c07ddd74-222c-571e-9c27-505ec68ca272,N24News/imgs/c07ddd74-222c-571e-9c27-505ec68ca272.jpg,4
Education,"Web-Era Trade Schools, Feeding a Need for Code",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/14/us/web-era-trade-schools-feeding-a-need-for-code.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A new educational institution, the coding boot camp, is quietly emerging as the vocational school for the digital age, devoted to creating software developers. These boot camps reflect the start-up ethic: small for-profit enterprises that are fast (classes are two to four months), nimble (revising curriculum to meet industry needs) and unconcerned with SAT scores or diplomas. Most are expensive, but some accept a share of the graduates' first-year earnings or a finder's fee from employers as payment. Most important, at a time when so many young people are underemployed, most graduates, especially those from highly selective boot camps, quickly find well-paying jobs. In a recent survey of 48 boot camps, Course Report, an online boot camp directory, found that three-quarters of graduates were employed, with raises averaging 44 percent from their pre-boot camp pay and an average salary of $76,000. Enrolling 20 to 40 students at a time, many boot camps have venture capital backing; in May, Dev Bootcamp, which started here and expanded to New York and Chicago, was bought by Kaplan, the educational services company.

With trade schools out of fashion, for-profit colleges often dismissed as expensive dropout factories, and community college students failing to graduate a majority of their students, the rise of boot camps over the past two years is challenging assumptions about higher education, at least for some smart, highly motivated people. Many boot camps are clustered in the South of Market neighborhood here, a center for software start-ups. But 60 such schools have been started across the nation since 2012, attracting students with the promise that anyone -- even someone without a computer background -- who works hard can learn enough to qualify for a job developing software in an industry desperate for programming talent. On one recent evening at Dev Bootcamp, where class officially ended at 6 p.m. and faculty members were long gone, a sixth-floor classroom was still humming at 9, filled with students sitting in pairs, working on their projects. ""It's a lot of hours, it's exhausting, and each week I think I can't do it anymore,"" said Shakrah Yves, 31, who three months ago was working as a seamstress. ""But each week I learn so much, and it's so exciting to be able to build your own app."" Most boot camps charge $1,000 a week or more, and attract a mix of career changers -- lawyers, consultants, artists -- and students who left college to learn to code, looking for a fast track to a well-paying career.

Anthony P. Carnevale, director of Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce, said that in the old industrial economy such training took place on the job, but that today's economy relies on postsecondary schools to prepare young people for jobs. And most colleges have no ready niche for teaching students to write software. Most coding boot camps attract people interested in making a career change and students who have left college. ""This is too applied, too hands-on, too small-bite to fit easily into a college curriculum,"" he said. ""Think of it as a place where technology outruns education."" The schools' revenue models differ substantially. App Academy, in San Francisco and New York, charges no tuition, but takes 18 percent of graduates' first-year salaries, with a $5,000 discount for those who take a job with a partner employer. At the Flatiron School, in New York, tuition is $12,000, with a $4,000 refund for students who take a job with a partner employer. (Employers are also asked to pay the school 15 percent of the students' first-year salaries.) Many schools offer discounts for women and minorities. Some accept fewer than 10 percent of applicants, culled through Skype interviews and coding exercises. Working 10 hours a day, boot camp students cover a semester's worth of material in four days, said Anne Spalding, who left a tenured computer-science post to teach at Dev Bootcamp. ""It's a more engaging way to learn, through projects, and each group amazes me with their final projects,"" she said. ""My goal is that in 10 years, the boot camp approach will be part of higher education.""

The most selective boot camps claim job-placement rates of nearly 100 percent and average salaries of $85,000 to $100,000 (lower in New York than in San Francisco). But the numbers are self-reported, and some count temporary jobs and internships as employment. At some point, the market will be saturated, but for now the demand for skilled programmers is enormous. ""There are almost five jobs for every one web developer,"" said Bethany Marzewski of Stack Overflow Careers, a computer job website. ""It's absolutely the toughest job to fill."" Alyssa Ravasio knows the problem. She founded Hipcamp, which helps people choose California camping sites, after finishing Dev Bootcamp last year. ""It's a talent war, especially for people with a few years of experience,"" Ms. Ravasio said. ""I've tried to hire a couple of my classmates, but they all had jobs they were happy with."" Dev Bootcamp's students must spend nine weeks mastering fundamentals on their own before starting the nine-week residential program. A new group begins every three weeks, and students falling behind can repeat a three-week module for free.

Now an evening coach there, he sits calmly, waiting for students to approach, laptops in hand, seeking advice on where their code has gone wrong. Mr. Root looks hard at their screens, then makes a suggestion or sends them back a few steps. Mr. Root's group included a 20-year-old who had not finished college and a Harvard graduate who later returned to the same company where he had worked, but as a coder. Some boot camp students have already taken college computer classes, but realized that while they had learned a lot of theory and algorithms, they had not gotten fluency in Ruby or JavaScript, the programming languages favored by industry, or real experience in building things. Boot camp students spend time working in pairs at shared stations, taking turns as the ""driver,"" who types lines of code, and the ""navigator,"" who reviews the lines and suggests changes. While skeptics say a few weeks at boot camp is not enough to produce a functioning developer, some employers disagree. Indiegogo, a San Francisco-based crowdfunding site, has hired six people straight from boot camps, and Victor Kovalev, the vice president for engineering, pronounced them ""awesome."" ""It's very impressive to put your life on pause and learn engineering in a boot camp,"" he said. ""The boot camp engineers tend to be very sharp, very driven, very excited to be engineers.","Dozens of the schools have sprung up around the country to teach computer programming, offering students a fast-paced curriculum and the promise of jobs.",828a4a88-7b74-5b9f-a8d8-2332a98e716f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/14/us/SUB-JP-BOOTCAMP1/SUB-JP-BOOTCAMP1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=b4ad8d7a4688d8cc602e0dc7e1966599ee0be3ca3ca8e27f731912f0cae0deaa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Students at Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco, one of the dozens of schools that have sprung up nationwide to teach computer code.",828a4a88-7b74-5b9f-a8d8-2332a98e716f,N24News/imgs/828a4a88-7b74-5b9f-a8d8-2332a98e716f.jpg,22

Food,"The Olive Garden Is Open, but Marilyn Hagerty Isn't Eating There",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/dining/marilyn-hagerty-grand-forks-restaurants.html,"Marilyn Hagerty won national renown for her 2012 review of an Olive Garden restaurant, but she also covers news and other goings-on around Grand Forks, N.D. She said she writes about the things ""you'd tell your friends but you wouldn't put in the paper.""





North Dakota's most famous restaurant critic has been eating at home lately. It's not that there's nowhere to go in and around Grand Forks, where she lives and writes. Her governor, Doug Burgum, has allowed restaurants and bars to stay open even though the state has had the third-highest death rate from Covid-19 over the past week. It is not that Marilyn Hagerty is running out of steam at 94, either. She files three columns for The Grand Forks Herald each week, even though she has officially retired from the paper ""two or three times,"" as she puts it. She had already been retired for at least two decades when, in 2012, she wrote a column that chronicled the arrival of her town's first Olive Garden. Ms. Hagerty's account, written in her usual style of valuing factual data above critical appraisal, sent the internet into convulsions. An overnight sensation in her 80s, she appeared twice on Anderson Cooper's syndicated talk show and signed a book deal with Anthony Bourdain's imprint.

Ms. Hagerty has lived alone since the 1997 death of her husband, Jack Hagerty, who had been editor of the Herald. ""She was going on as normal,"" said her son, James R. Hagerty, until about a month ago, when she told him during a phone call that she had gone to a truck stop for breakfast. This was around the time that North Dakota's Covid-19 outbreak was becoming the worst in the country. ""You know, that's probably not a good idea,"" he remembers saying. ""Well, we were all wearing masks,"" she said. ""But you had to take the masks off to eat, right?"" After some familial back and forth, Ms. Hagerty decided to restrict her professional dining to takeout and delivery until going out in Grand Forks is safer. For a restaurant critic in New York City, hearing about Ms. Hagerty's experience of 2020 can be like glimpsing an alternate reality. Hundreds of New York restaurants have gone out of business this year, from places with national reputations like Blue Smoke and Uncle Boons to scruffy neighborhood coffee shops that looked as if they might return until the day a ""For Rent"" sign appeared in the window.

In and around Grand Forks, though, Ms. Hagerty could not think of any restaurants killed off by the pandemic. She did know of one that was temporarily shut. Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.
* None
* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. ""The Ramada Inn has a cafe where they serve a very nice Sunday breakfast and that's closed, but the bar in the Ramada Inn is open,"" she said. ""They are serving dinner in there."" Of course, Grand Forks, a city of about 50,000 people, had fewer restaurants to begin with. One result of this is that Ms. Hagerty circles back to write about places she has already reviewed more frequently than is typical for her professional peers in larger cities. She has returned to take the temperature of the Olive Garden several times, most recently in February, when she ordered the same meal she had immortalized eight years earlier.

""Fettuccine Alfredo has 1,010 calories and is $12.99,"" she wrote. ""The salad was nicely chilled. But since there were only two black olives to be found, I asked for more."" In her original review, Ms. Hagerty had noted that the salad contained ""several"" olives, which seemed to satisfy her. Her last indoor restaurant meal, before she agreed to stay home for a while, was also a return engagement: The Blue Moose Bar & Grill, a pub across the Red River in East Grand Forks, Minn. Nathan Sheppard, one of the owners, said that when Ms. Hagerty shows up unannounced at the host stand, every 12 to 18 months or so, it does not kick up the kind of stir that you might have seen on TV or in a movie.

""Usually one of the floor managers comes back and tells me, 'Hey, Marilyn's here,'"" Mr. Sheppard said. ""If she sees something negative, she'll politely mention it, but she doesn't Gordon Ramsay it and start throwing plates around and saying, 'This ratatouille is garbage.'"" Ms. Hagerty's Blue Moose update approvingly noted the consistency of the cooking over time, but safety was clearly on her mind, too. Face coverings are required in all indoor public spaces in Minnesota, and Ms. Hagerty reported that the restaurant offered masks to customers who had forgotten theirs. Attention was paid to social distancing, too. ""The Moose operates cautiously,"" she wrote. A few Blue Moose customers have asked if they really had to wear a mask, Mr. Sheppard said, but not many, particularly now that Covid is a familiar presence in the area. ""In March you still heard people talking about whether or not this is even real, because they don't know anyone who has it,"" he said. ""Now everyone knows someone in their personal life who has it."" Some restaurant owners in North Dakota resisted masks until about a month ago, when Governor Burgum announced a one-month order mandating face coverings at indoor businesses. Ms. Hagerty recalled going to a Grand Forks tavern for hamburgers shortly before the governor's action and being concerned by the number of unmasked customers milling around the bar. She and her dinner companions wore masks. ""I was with two of my lady friends, and we're not spring chickens,"" she said. ""They kind of looked at us funny, but that doesn't bother me. I go everywhere."" While she is best known to outsiders for writing about the national chains that play a major role in the local dining scene, Ms. Hagerty has also written about places serving Thai, Vietnamese and Somali cuisine.

She brought the restaurant's shrimp scampi and some other items home last week, she said. She seemed disinclined to tip her hand before her thoughts came out in print, but it sounded as if some subtle reassessment was underway. Her verdict was posted on her paper's website on Saturday. ""Somehow shrimp scampi tastes better to me inside the Olive Garden than in a take-home format,"" Ms. Hagerty wrote. ""But in these days of coronavirus, dinner at home has its appeal.""","At 94, the author of a North Dakota restaurant review that became an internet sensation is still at work.

Health,"200,000 Uninsured Americans to Get Free H.I.V.-Prevention Drugs",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/03/health/truvada-prep-hiv-gilead.html,"With donated drugs and services provided by major pharmacy chains, 200,000 uninsured Americans will gain access to H.I.V.-preventive medicines at no cost, the Trump administration announced on Tuesday. The announcement, by Alex M. Azar II, the health and human services secretary, essentially explained how the government plans to distribute the drugs for pre-exposure prophylaxis, or PrEP, that were promised in May by the drugmaker Gilead Sciences. PrEP describes a strategy of preventing infection with H.I.V. by taking a single pill a day, either Truvada or Descovy. Both are made by Gilead. The strategy is 99 percent effective at preventing infection, studies have shown, and is a mainstay of the administration's campaign to end the H.I.V. epidemic. Some American cities with high H.I.V. rates, such as San Francisco, already have programs that pay the costs of PrEP for the uninsured. Gilead itself offers the drug at no cost to those who cannot afford it, or picks up insurance co-pays for patients who qualify.

But the new program -- called Ready, Set, PrEP -- marks the first time the federal government is supplying PrEP to patients not enrolled in Medicaid, the Veterans Health Administration or any other federal health program. Under the new program, any patient who lacks health insurance, has had a recent negative H.I.V. test and has a prescription for PrEP -- presumably obtained from a doctor -- can call 855-447-8410 or sign onto a new government website, getyourprep.com, to apply for free H.I.V.-prevention drugs. They can also apply in person, Mr. Azar said, through a participating health care provider, such as a community clinic. Until March 30, the government will pay Gilead $200 per bottle -- each bottle of Truvada contains 30 pills -- to cover the cost of moving donated drugs from factories through the supply chain to patients, Mr. Azar said.

About 1.2 million Americans could benefit from PrEP because they are at high risk of getting H.I.V. from unprotected sex or needle-sharing, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Only an estimated 270,000 people are now taking the drugs. Truvada and Descovy are now mired in billion-dollar patent lawsuits pitting H.H.S. against Gilead. The federal government and the company both claim ownership of patents covering the use of the drugs to prevent H.I.V. infection. But Mr. Azar said the new program was ""not related"" to the lawsuits. ""That matter will be resolved in the court system,"" he said. Dr. Rochelle P. Walensky, leader of a team at Massachusetts General Hospital that has analyzed the costs of the H.I.V. plans of the Obama and Trump administrations, said she was ""having a hard time understanding why the government is paying $200 a month per bottle to dispense these drugs."" Truvada does not need refrigeration or special handling, and it is distributed free in France and Norway. The drug costs patients only $96 a year in Australia, $384 in Germany and $720 in Ireland. The company has promised to donate enough of the drugs to cover as many as 200,000 people for 11 years in the United States.

Mr. Azar described the $200 per bottle payments as a stopgap measure that will enable rolling out the drugs as soon as possible. The amount is what Gilead claimed it pays the pharmacy supply chai n to distribute its drugs, he said. After March 30, Mr. Azar said, with a combination of donated pharmacy costs and competitive bidding for distribution contracts, ""I think we'll be able to do better."" Gilead makes no money from the distribution arrangement, said Ryan McKeel, a company spokesman. It will reimburse vendors but not charge the government for the time of any Gilead employees involved. Any tax deductions the company takes for its donation, he added, will be based on the cost of making the pills, not on their market value or distribution costs. James Krellenstein, a founder of the advocacy group Prep4All Collaboration, said the government's plan ""is poised to repeat the errors of Gilead's own medication 

assistance program."" While uninsured patients may get free drugs under the program, he said, they get no help paying for the medical exam and laboratory tests needed to get and keep renewing the prescription, which can cost up to $1,000 a year. Instead of focusing on paying Gilead up to $6 million for high pharmaceutical supply chain costs, the government could pay for lab tests for 6,000 patients, Mr. Krellenstein said.",A new government program will provide donated drugs through major drugstore chains.,e69a7eb2-a4ac-5ae1-901e-08e0a7ade0b3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/03/science/03PREP1/03PREP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b1f1518ed0d4467373ae73868d3cd55a29e3ca2523a8c4bf6882853da2a3ac48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A dose of Truvada, an H.I.V.-prevention drug manufactured by Gilead Sciences.",e69a7eb2-a4ac-5ae1-901e-08e0a7ade0b3,N24News/imgs/e69a7eb2-a4ac-5ae1-901e-08e0a7ade0b3.jpg,1

Opinion,"President Bukele, Brute Force Is Not the Way Forward for El Salvador",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/opinion/bukele-el-salvador.html,"On Sunday, President Nayib Bukele of El Salvador arrived at the Legislative Assembly with a group of uniformed soldiers holding automatic weapons. He wants the parliament to approve a $109 million loan from the Central American Development Bank so that he can buy helicopters, night vision goggles, a video surveillance system, a boat and other equipment for the military to fight crime, his central policy proposal to address the country's gang problem. It was the most overt display of brute force since the end of the civil war in 1992. Yet the United States and the European Union have only issued mild rebukes. It's going to take more than that to cow a man who shows absolute disregard for the balance of democratic powers. Mr. Bukele, who holds a minority in Congress, invoked Article 167 to convene an extraordinary session on the weekend to endorse the deal. According to legal experts, Article 167 can be used only to call Congress back from recess when a natural disaster or calamity occurs, not to do the president's bidding. On Saturday, he had removed the police who are assigned to protect the legislators and replaced them with heavily armed military and national police, who surrounded the Legislative Assembly and posted snipers on the roof. When legislators refused to attend, he accused them of rupturing the constitutional order. He sent soldiers to recalcitrant legislators' homes to order them to appear. His political allies around the country arranged buses to bring hundreds of supporters to demonstrate in the streets surrounding Congress.

On Sunday, accompanied by soldiers carrying automatic rifles, Mr. Bukele walked into the legislative chamber and occupied the chair of the body's president, who did not attend. He bowed his head and prayed for three minutes. When he looked up, he informed the soldiers and the few deputies in attendance that he had been ""speaking with God,"" who lucky for them urged patience. He announced that he would give Congress a week to approve the loan. In a speech to his supporters outside, he said he would remove lawmakers from the legislature if he needed to. ""So they're going to make us vote with a rifle to the head?"" said Leonardo Bonilla, an independent deputy who had supported many of Mr. Bukele's proposals and who was one of the few who attended the session. ""This isn't the way a democracy works."" Mr. Bukele is banking on high approval ratings and the corruption accusations engulfing the opposition to eclipse warnings that he is trampling on institutional protections. He is also counting on Salvadorans to support his tough-on-crime approach to address one of the highest murder rates in the world, along with terrifying rates of sexual violence and disappearances. On Monday, El Salvador's Supreme Court suspended any acts resulting from the emergency session and ordered Mr. Bukele to refrain from using the military in ways that are unconstitutional and ""endanger the republican, democratic and representative system of government."" The ruling, a courageous act that is possible because of several decades of slow democratic progress that have helped an independent judiciary take root, deserves to be applauded and supported from inside and outside El Salvador. It has been disappointing to see only mumbled remonstrance from foreign powers and international institutions that could curb Mr. Bukele's authoritarian plunge. The delegation of the European Union to El Salvador, expressing ""great concern,"" rightly invoked the importance of the rule of law, respect for political pluralism and separation of powers in its response, but then posited a false equivalency, calling on both the president and the Legislative Assembly to respect institutional independence. To be clear, it is not the Congress that has overstepped its bounds, it is President Bukele.

The United States ambassador in El Salvador said that he did not approve of the military presence in the assembly, while acknowledging the calls to ""patience,"" echoing the term used by President Bukele. The secretary general of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, tweeted in the midst of the crisis that he had spoken with El Salvador's foreign minister and that she had expressed respect for the country's institutions. Those words blew away in the wind as President Bukele and his heavily armed military escort invaded the Legislative Assembly building on Sunday. The O.A.S. should call for an urgent meeting under the Democratic Charter, which aims to protect the separation of powers, to deal with this blatant attempt to undermine the rule of law. O.A.S. member states should react consistently to this type of outburst, regardless of the political ideology or popular support of our leaders. Their silence could be interpreted as tacit support. They should not normalize President Bukele's brazen attacks on democratic institutions. There should be no room for double standards.

Health,House Ethics Office Says New York Congressman May Have Violated Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/12/health/collins-ethics-inquiry.html,"Representative Chris Collins of New York may have violated federal law by sharing nonpublic information about a company on whose board he served, according to a report released Thursday by the Office of Congressional Ethics. The report also said Mr. Collins may have broken House ethics rules by meeting with the National Institutes of Health and asking for help with the design of a clinical trial being set up by the company, Innate Immunotherapeutics. Mr. Collins, a Republican whose district encompasses much of western New York, is also the company's largest shareholder, reporting for the year 2016 that he held between $25 million and $50 million in the company. The House Committee on Ethics, which has the power to discipline members of the House for wrongdoing, said Thursday that it would further review the findings, a step short of opening a formal investigation. The bipartisan, quasi-independent office, which refers ethics issues to the committee, recommended the review by a unanimous vote. Stanley Brand, a prominent criminal defense and ethics lawyer in Washington, said the ethics committee could still choose to drop the case. ""It's not a foregone conclusion that the ethics committee is going to take this up,"" he said.

The inquiry centers on Mr. Collins's investment in Innate, a struggling biotech company that trades on the Australian stock exchange and has just one drug, to treat multiple sclerosis, in development. Despite the company's low profile, its investors have included several other Washington power players, including Tom Price, the former secretary of Health and Human Services who recently resigned under fire, and four other members of Congress. Mr. Collins told reporters Thursday that he had done nothing wrong. He described the inquiry as being the result of a ""witch hunt"" driven by Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York, who requested the investigation. The office dismissed another allegation -- that Mr. Collins purchased discounted stock not available to the public. Mr. Collins's involvement with the company surfaced in December of 2015, and picked up steam during the confirmation of Mr. Price, a former Republican Congressman from Georgia whose active investment in pharmaceutical and health care stocks drew scrutiny -- and calls for an investigation -- from Democrats, including Ms. Slaughter. In a statement, Ms. Slaughter said, ""He put his obsession to enrich himself before the people he swore to represent. It is a disgrace to Congress and to his constituents, who deserve better."" The congressional ethics office said Mr. Price refused to cooperate with their investigation, as did Simon Wilkinson, Innate's chief executive, and other company officials and investors. It recommended that the House committee issue subpoenas to those who did not cooperate. Mr. Price and officials with Innate could not be reached for comment.

Mr. Collins enthusiastically pitched Innate to nearly everyone he met, the report said, discussing the company with members of Congress and his own staff, ""most"" of whom were also investors. ""The bigger question would be, who haven't I talked to?"" he told investigators. Two of Mr. Collins's children also owned stock. The report found that Mr. Collins frequently updated shareholders on the company's activity, including nonpublic information, in possible violation of federal law and House rules. Some of the nonpublic information that he shared in emails, the report said, included details about how many participants had enrolled in the company's crucial clinical trial and details about the company's communications with large drugmakers who might be interested in acquiring Innate. The report also found that Mr. Collins may have violated ethics rules in mingling his official and personal roles when interacting with employees at the N.I.H. In 2013, during a public hearing, Mr. Collins mentioned the drug Innate was developing -- called MIS416 -- without disclosing his financial interest. His Congressional staff later set up a meeting with N.I.H. staff. Mr. Collins told them that he was associated with Innate and asked one employee -- an expert on multiple sclerosis -- for assistance with the company's clinical trial, the report said. That employee later met with Innate's chief scientific officer three times, the report found. In comments to reporters, Mr. Collins said it was the N.I.H. that ""invited me to go there and this was an afterthought at the end of a tour."" He said the later meetings were a ""scientist to scientist"" conversation about the frustrations of developing treatments for multiple sclerosis, and nothing more. Mr. Price divested from Innate as well as other health care stocks after he became the head of H.H.S., but Mr. Collins is still the company's largest investor. Mr. Price resigned in September from his Cabinet post after facing criticism for his expensive use of charter jets for government trips. In June, Innate's stock plummeted by more than 90 percent after it announced that the clinical trial of its drug had failed. Michael A. Quinn, Innate's chairman said in the company's annual report that Innate is still reviewing the results of the trial and that the company's future hinges on the drug's success.",An inquiry centered on actions by a New York Congressman who is a majority stockholder in a biotech company.,ce706f3a-971b-5685-97f4-e0747a2f5a82,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/13/us/13COLLINS-sub2/13COLLINS-sub2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=cfd6e907c44201d3bbea4a6defcfb5b6de62d89a66349f46b1d625f9252cb5b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Representative Chris Collins of New York last month.

Technology,The Woman Taking Over TikTok at the Toughest Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/technology/tiktok-vanessa-pappas-bytedance.html," Credit...Rozette Rago for The New York Times



Six weeks ago, as TikTok grappled with escalating tensions between the United States and China, the social media app's top executives huddled together to figure out their next steps. Vanessa Pappas, 41, was worried. TikTok's North American business, which she has run since 2018, was dealing with an uproar. President Trump had threatened to ban TikTok because of its Chinese owner, ByteDance, and many of the more than 100 million people who use TikTok in the United States were up in arms. So in the early hours of Aug. 1, Ms. Pappas recorded a 59-second video from her home office in Los Angeles to calm the creators on TikTok and its fans. ""We've heard your outpouring of support, and we wanted to say thank you,"" she said in the video, which quickly went viral under the hashtag #SaveTikTok. ""We're not planning on going anywhere.""

Under an executive order from President Trump, ByteDance must essentially strike a deal to sell off TikTok's U.S. operations by Sept. 20; it will have a few weeks after that to close a sale. Yet after weeks of negotiations with potential buyers such as Microsoft, Walmart and Oracle, the discussions were thrown into disarray when the Chinese government signaled that it would weigh in on TikTok's future. On Sunday, officials said Microsoft's bid was rejected. In a recent 30-minute interview over Zoom from her home, Ms. Pappas said TikTok's predicament was ""unique"" and described what it was like to navigate it through ""a challenging time."" She declined to discuss specifics about TikTok's deal talks and said she was not involved in them. Instead, Ms. Pappas said, she is focused on what TikTok's future could look like if the app's ownership is bifurcated. Most of all, she said, she is doubling down on putting TikTok's community of creators and users -- ranging from those who post videos of cake decorating to those who break dance -- first. Ms. Pappas later added that she regularly talked to Zhang Yiming, ByteDance's founder and chief executive, about all of these issues.

To focus on its community, TikTok in July formed a Creator Fund, where creators can earn cash for views, starting with $200 million. And with the pandemic forcing people indoors for the foreseeable future, Ms. Pappas said she and her team were working on making TikTok an uplifting place to visit. Last month, the company launched a largest national advertising campaign on television and digital media, highlighting more than 30 popular creators under the tagline ""It starts on TikTok."" ""We've built this product for hundreds of millions of people, and we're not looking for that to change,"" said Ms. Pappas, a former YouTube executive. But keeping TikTok's community happy in such a turbulent period may be challenging. Some creators and fans have been rattled by Mr. Trump's moves against the app. Since his executive order, people in the United States have installed TikTok about 6.5 million times, down 13 percent from before the order, according to Sensor Tower, an app analytics firm. Competitors have also pounced. Facebook introduced Reels, a TikTok clone inside Instagram, in August. The social network has also doled out millions of dollars to some of TikTok's biggest stars to lure them over to using Reels. Ms. Pappas said she wasn't worried about Facebook and Instagram Reels. ""You can certainly copy a feature, but you can't copy a community,"" she said. ""I think that's really hard to replicate."" Tom Keiser, chief executive of Hootsuite, a social media management company, said TikTok was right to make its power users a priority. ""They need to be investing in those folks,"" he said. ""There's so many things out of their control, but their future growth is based on influencers and content creators continuing to evolve and grow and leverage the new capabilities TikTok is rolling out.""

Ms. Pappas has worked in the online influencer world since some of its earliest days. Half Greek by birth, she grew up in Australia and speaks with an Aussie twang. She moved to London when she was 20, and eventually migrated to New York. In 2007, she joined Next New Networks, a company that helped web video creators earn money from their efforts. YouTube bought Next New Networks in 2011. Ms. Pappas joined YouTube and quickly rose through the ranks. She was YouTube's first audience development lead, a role that led her to connect with video makers. Her division at YouTube developed and popularized the term ""creator"" and helped transform video blogging, or vlogging, into a full-time job. Ms. Pappas also wrote a book, ""The YouTube Creator Playbook,"" on how creators could make money from their followings, in 2011. She went on to develop YouTube's Creator Academy, an educational content portal that teaches creators how to build a business on YouTube, and a channel certification program, which teaches creators about digital rights management, legal issues and advanced analytics. TikTok lured her from YouTube at the end of 2018 to be its general manager and head of North America, based in Los Angeles. At the time, TikTok had just expanded globally. It was a new challenge for Ms. Pappas, who said she had wanted to get in on the ground floor of the next big creator movement. ""It was this burgeoning community that resonated as this next evolution of what the creator meant and redefined the creators over again,"" she said.

TikTok noted that its community guidelines prohibit bullying and harassment, and encouraged its users to ""exercise care and good judgment when it comes to the content they post, including parents and others who set an example through their behavior,"" a spokeswoman said. Nick Tangorra, 22, a TikTok creator with 1.2 million followers, said he had met Ms. Pappas only once but believed that she was the only tech leader who understood the creator community's needs. ""It starts at the top,"" he said. ""TikTok knows fully that this app is what it is because of its creators. Vanessa is putting such an emphasis on creators, making sure we feel supported by the platform.""","Vanessa Pappas is keeping a focus on the app's community of creators and users as it deals with pressure from President Trump, Beijing and a possible sale.",f27bdaff-e375-5872-8636-eedf909efd41,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/11/business/00tiktok-pappas-01/00tiktok-pappas-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0ebda958eded17a399f4594fe1ad22ea3b3e5f80436207c3b73da7d3f6f61594&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vanessa Pappas, who has overseen TikTok's North American business since 2018, was elevated to interim global chief.",f27bdaff-e375-5872-8636-eedf909efd41,N24News/imgs/f27bdaff-e375-5872-8636-eedf909efd41.jpg,20
Art & Design,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/23/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,"Nancy Shaver's exhibitions often overload the senses. They are extravaganzas of stuff, colorful and tactile, mostly society's castoffs recycled into forms that expose false binaries, like high versus low, form versus function, masculine versus feminine and art versus craft. Ms. Shaver operates simultaneously as artist, curator, hoarder and stylist. She is also an astute frequenter of flea markets, seeking items for both her work and her secondhand store, Henry, in Hudson, N.Y. Her latest New York show, at Derek Eller, demonstrates her complex proclivities with special clarity. Its title, ""A Part of a Part of a Part,"" suggests a parsing of her efforts.

Some of the art is cobbled together from found materials or objects, most notably her signature wall pieces, called ""Blockers"": little wood blocks, individually covered with paint, fabric, paper or wallpaper, and arranged into grids, which evoke projects ranging from quilts to scrapbooks to works by Piet Mondrian and Joseph Cornell. A similar process is achieved in a beautiful, porous sculpture, ""Drawing #30 -- Light and Air,"" in which stacks of little thread spools evoke Brancusi's ""Endless Column,"" in embryo. But Ms. Shaver also uses things as they are, frequently in large numbers, as in the ambitious ""Collections -- Love and Work."" It includes wooden drawer knobs; baby hats from China, Afghanistan and Uzbekistan; beaded evening bags; and a handmade snow shovel. (Duchamp, anyone?) Some things have been borrowed from Robin Greeson, a collector of textiles and antiques, including the 19 colorful, exquisitely embroidered mola blouses from Panama. These figure prominently, with numerous ""Blockers,"" in ""Tapestry #3,"" an immense wall installation. A few things lent by Ms. Greeson and other sources are presented in isolation, including a suggestively beaded harem-pant onesie said to have been worn by Nijinsky, and two works by Vanessa Bell, the British artist of Bloomsbury Group fame, the best of which is, fittingly, a textile design. There's more, including 17 small, free-standing ""Sentinel"" pieces. They need either more thought or space, but don't let them stop you. ROBERTA SMITH

Giorgione, Raphael, Caravaggio, Watteau, Gericault, Seurat, Schiele, Boccioni: All of them changed the course of European painting, and all of them died before they were 40. There are entire histories of art that never happened because of war and illness. Another name deserves a place on that list of trailblazers who were gone too soon: Domenico Gnoli, whose unsettling paintings of isolated bodies, clothing and furniture shook up the art world of 1960s Italy, but who was brought down by cancer in 1970, at the age of 36.

Gnoli painted overlooked details of bourgeois Italian life -- a chair, a shoe, a forehead with slicked and parted hair -- at bizarre scales, some on canvases more than six feet wide. The close-ups can be comically dull, as in that of a love seat fitted with a ghastly slipcover of Creamsicle orange, seen from a high angle, and with its back cushion cropped at the top. Or they can be fetishistic: Witness the sickly-shiny gloss of a woman's leather heels, or the evocative dimple of a man's necktie, blown up to five feet square.

Though these paintings are precise, they are not photorealistic. The silk of the necktie, for instance, looks like ridges of Plasticine, while the skin and hair of Gnoli's models recall the waxy figuration of Carlo Carra, Giorgio di Chirico and other Italian predecessors. Gnoli mixed sand into the acrylic paint, which gives them an archaeological undernote. And if his close-ups have a parallel in contemporary American Pop Art, or in the French painting of Narrative Figuration, there is no apparent social engagement here, unless you count the alienated downward gaze and the extreme cropping of the images, which turns the amulets of the borghesi into things ornery, oppressive and comic.

For his videos in the show ""On Non-Visibility,"" at Greene Naftali, Tony Cokes samples statements from political speeches, Twitter feeds and stand-up comedy routines, and displays them in stark white lettering against bright monochrome backgrounds, accompanied by post-punk pop music. ""It's called the 'American Dream' 'cause you have to be asleep to believe it,"" one video says, quoting the comedian George Carlin. In another video, a deliciously mournful tune by the Smiths accompanies an essay-like text that considers how television images helped mobilize the civil rights movement. Other works ruminate on the United States military's use of loud and ceaseless pop music to torture Muslim prisoners (""The New York Sun called it 'mood music for jolting your jihadi'""), or incendiary tweets and remarks by Donald J. Trump, Lars von Trier and Kanye West. Made over the last 30 years, the work here feels very postmodern, very 1980s, since it leans heavily on appropriation, pastiche, critical theory and graphic design. And yet it feels fresh -- partly because of renewed interest in text-based art by people like Barbara Kruger, Jenny Holzer and Gretchen Bender, and partly because the media manipulation and coercion that Mr. Cokes identifies has become more exaggerated today. Since Mr. Cokes's video works are essentially essays, set to music, the only problem is that they challenge your reading-in-the-gallery endurance. More than once, I felt my energy and attention flagging -- only to be yanked in again by a punchy Gang of Four pop song. Since the work here is often about how music and words can be used in sinister and destructive ways, it's also thrilling to experience them employed to critical and enlightened ends.

Rita McBride's installation ""Particulates,"" at Dia:Chelsea, is like something out of a sci-fi movie. When you approach the door to the gallery, a sign warns you of ""DANGER"" from laser radiation. It says, ""Do not attempt to make contact with any laser beams!!"" -- the perfect setup for a film scene in which hapless visitors accidentally touch a beam and gain- a superpower or travel through time. The work inside maintains this impression. As you step into the cavernous, murky gallery, you're confronted by green beams of light -- lines that rotate as they extend from one end of the space to the other in a shape that's called a hyperboloid of revolution. Mist machines create clouds of condensation that roll on and off the beams, which appear to be moving, too: The green lights seem to snake along, as if on a network of conveyor belts. Getting closer reveals activity inside the beams. The lasers illuminate water droplets and bits of extra-reflective dust left over from when the space was a marble-cutting shop. These particulates swirl around in the light, looking like pixels set free of a screen. For decades, Ms. McBride has been making sculptures of elemental forms (fences, an amphitheater, keys) as a way of questioning how we relate to the constructed components of society. ""Particulates"" marries her interest in geometry -- she's used the hyperboloid before, most famously in her 170-foot-tall public sculpture ""Mae West"" -- to her interest in science fiction. She commissioned stories in that genre for a book to accompany this show, and previously created a collaborative sci-fi novel. Working with light, a new medium for Ms. McBride, allows her to achieve something both thoroughly material and profoundly otherworldly. Even as the installation illuminates the hidden life of the space it's in, it feels like a portal to another dimension, shimmering with the possibilities of an unknown future.

Dance,"Review: The Tap Dancer Dormeshia Finds Her Groove, and Then Some",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/04/arts/dance/dormeshia-and-still-you-must-swing-review.html,"Dance relies on technique, but if that's all there is, a performance loses its dimension; its energy fizzles out. There are many points to be made about an excellent show like ""And Still You Must Swing,"" led by Dormeshia, a tap dancer of exceptional elegance, dazzling speed and, yes, an abundance of technique. But above all, at its foundation, there is heart and conviction. And, mission accomplished: It swings. Dormeshia, who no longer uses a last name -- she's tap dance royalty, she doesn't need one -- has a delightfully lively projection , yet never more than the moment requires. Her reason to dance extends way beyond footwork. She's nurturing, both to the tap form, whose jazz roots she celebrates here, and to her fellow dancers. In ""Swing,"" she shares the stage with two exceptional tap dancers, Jason Samuels Smith and Derick K. Grant, and another radiant performer, Camille A. Brown. Headliners, all.

At the Joyce Theater through Sunday, the program mixes robust unison trios for the tap dancers with nuanced, personal solos titled ""Swings."" In ""Jason Swings,"" Mr. Smith is a virtuosic wonder , shifting seamlessly from power to quiet sensitivity . His fearless dancing even involved a shoe mishap -- he slipped out of his heel, but deftly fixed the problem mid-step and continued on . And no one dances quite like Mr. Grant, who glides across the stage with a voluptuous, bearlike grace as his feet spark into impossibly intricate rhythms.

Dormeshia is simply transfixing. For a dancer so grounded and connected to the floor -- in ways that you not only see but hear -- she moves as if buoyed by the air: When she swings, she floats. She has always had a magic quality about her, but with ""And Still You Must Swing,"" which runs a swift 75 minutes and features a jazz quartet performing original music by Allison Miller and Dormeshia, she attains an even greater level of expressiveness. And as the show's leader, it's fitting: This is a celebration of her articulate body and all the information that it contains.

It makes sense that the tap dancers perform with Ms. Brown, a contemporary choreographer who explores African-American identity in her work; here, she wears sneakers and lights up the stage with her own footwork -- as always, she's electric -- and swinging rhythms. She is a container, too, in solos that hint at how tap emerged out of slavery and struggle. But throughout the production, which had its premiere at Jacobs Pillow Dance Festival in 2016, the connective theme comes from the title, which itself comes from a quotation by the tap dancer Jimmy Slyde: ""There's balance involved. There's movement involved. And still you must swing."" It's an invisible line: Does Dormeshia find the groove or does the groove find her? Her eloquent dancing is utterly natural, full of strength, femininity and a worldly maturity that evokes a bygone glamour as movement melts from her shoulders. Throughout the show, she and the other tap dancers wear gold shoes -- halfway, she changes flats for heels -- and her glimmering feet are reflected on the base of two round platforms behind her. It's as if her dancing is giving off actual sparks.

There's a swing dance section, too, in which the tap dancers wear sneakers, and Dormeshia shows, yet again, that her understanding of rhythm has a way of enveloping the music like serious play: Just as she makes us pay attention to the moments between the notes, she lets us feel how a step can be as soft as taking a breath. The opening and closing numbers, trios for the tap dancers, end in the same way: Dormeshia high-fives each of the guys, who then cross their arms and stand sideways while she, arms out, poses in the center. It's a jaunty hello and goodbye -- even if it comes too soon. Dormeshia knows what she's doing: She leaves you wanting more of her brand of deeply felt tap, in which dancers -- good friends -- alive in the skill of their bodies, let us watch their conversations unfold in real time.

Technology,Apple Shuns the Tech Industry's Apology Tour,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/technology/apple-shuns-apology-tour.html,"SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Sorry, Apple's not sorry. There has been a theme at the tech industry's big conferences this year: Facebook and other tech giants keep telling us that they've learned from their mistakes and are going to be a lot more thoughtful about the far-out stuff they plan on doing in the future. Apple has been cool to this narrative, and it was striking how the company's executives danced around the tech backlash story line from the stage on Monday at its annual conference for developers. Though Apple acknowledged the darker side of society's obsession with the digital world, it didn't go anywhere near the idea that its own technology might bear any of the blame.

Apple did announce several new ways of letting adults and children limit how much time they spend on their phones. A tool called Screen Time, for example, is meant to help iPhone customers manage the time they spend on their devices. You can also add limits to how much you use certain apps. And parents will be able to use Screen Time to place limits on how their children use their iPhones.

Apple's software chief, Craig Federighi, said the company felt it was time to address smartphones' oversize impact on everyday life. ""For some of us, it's become such a habit we might not even recognize how distracted we've become,"" he said. These features looked quite handy -- we will know for sure once they're released to users this year. If they do push users to quit wasting so much time on Facebook and YouTube (where getting people to waste time is a big part of the business plan), they are sure to roil Apple's relationship with others in tech. But that is not Apple's problem; it is more concerned about selling you a new phone. Apple is also putting considerable resources into making its Watch stand apart from its phone, a direction that in the long run will create more opportunities to go without a phone. Are you wearing an Apple Watch instead of carrying an iPhone? In time, Apple may not care. But at its event here, Apple's support for what's being called ""digital well-being"" often awkwardly butted up against Apple's larger goal: to make the digital world so awesome, you can't resist it.

The next iPhone will let you turn your face into an emoji, and now it can even do ""tongue detection"" -- an animated version of your face can stick out its tongue when you do. With Apple's new augmented reality system, the iPhone can turn Legos into a video game. But if you can't even play with some Legos without reaching for your phone, isn't that kind of a problem?

Apple wants to stand apart from the techlash with its emphasis on privacy and its oft-stated distaste for the excesses of the internet ad industry. On Monday, the company said its Safari web browser would disable tracking software, or cookies, that advertising companies like Facebook and Google embed in websites to track users' activity across the internet. The new Safari feature is a direct swipe at the data-collection practices of big internet companies that Apple has tried hard to separate itself from. Apple argues that it has always been one of the more high-minded of the big tech companies, so it shouldn't be lumped in with outfits like Facebook. But that argument has always been a little complicated. Apple benefits from our obsession with social software; people buy its powerful phones to use Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, Snapchat and WhatsApp. Google pays Apple billions of dollars a year for the privilege of being the iPhone's default search engine. ""We aim to put the customer at the center of everything we do,"" Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said several times Monday. That seemed like a promise as well as a backhanded defense. Apple will give you the world. What you do with it is your own problem.","At the Apple developers' conference, it was striking how company executives danced around the tech backlash.",017a6825-6f57-54d7-8237-44c0b5715e94,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/05/business/05STATE-1/05STATE-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2826216d11ef2f5e9b3a6521e06420590f2bf593d2c8f810d1787db7ca149f23&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Craig Federighi, Apple's software chief, onstage Monday at its developers conference.

Health,Action Films May Spur the Need to Feed,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/09/health/action-films-may-spur-the-need-to-feed.html,"Action films may get the heart racing, but they may expand your waistline, a new study suggests.

Previous research has shown that people tend to eat more if they are watching television. But scientists from Cornell University wanted to know whether the type of programming made a difference. To find out, they gave snacks to 97 undergraduate students and split them into three groups. The first group watched a loud, frenetic clip from ""The Island,"" a 2005 action movie directed by Michael Bay. The second watched part of a Charlie Rose interview program on PBS. The third group watched the same excerpt from ""The Island"" as the first group, but without sound.

The first group consumed the most by far -- 65 percent more calories than the ""Charlie Rose"" group (354 calories versus 215) and 98 percent more food (7.3 ounces versus 3.7). The group that watched ""The Island"" on mute ate 46 percent more calories (315) and 36 percent more food (five ounces) than the Rose group.

""We choose this particular movie for its pacing,"" said Aner Tal, a research associate at Cornell's Food and Brand Lab and the study's lead author. He added, ""It could be that the camera cuts and sound set the tempo for the pace at which people eat.""","A study suggests that what you watch on TV affects how much you eat.

Opinion,Let's Fret the Night Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/opinion/biden-trump-2020.html,"Gail Collins: Bret, I am generally a pretty cheerful person. But I have to say that the news has been really, really depressing lately. At least on the domestic front. Plague, fire, economic collapse and the daily reminder that we have a president who isn't qualified to be head of a local block association ... Come on, give me some happy headlines. Honestly, Gail, I wish I could think of something positive for you. My problem is that I'm suffering from post-2016 stress disorder, which means I can't get it out of my head that the polls are all wrong and Donald Trump is going to win again. I get that Joe Biden isn't Hillary Clinton. I know he's doing better in battleground states than she was at this point in the race. And voters have had enough of Trump to last at least four bad lifetimes. And yet I just can't shake the feeling. Please tell me I'm wrong. Gail: Well, I may have sounded a tad overconfident. Gail: But this is not 2016, when many Americans wanted change after two terms of one party, and the Democrats nominated the most familiar political face of the last 30 years. Now the change-seekers will definitely be going in another direction.

Bret: That's true. The change vote ought to belong to Biden. Except that he's a recent former veep, as Walter Mondale was in '84. And he was also a fixture of the Senate for decades, as Bob Dole was when he ran in '96. My point is, he's not a fresh face in the way Barack Obama was in 2008, so the change he represents really means a restoration of sorts. Which would be completely OK by me, but I don't think I'm the most representative voter. Gail: Yeah, whenever we go down this road we wind up panicking. Think of it as post-post-2016 stress disorder. If Joe Biden doesn't have a disaster, he should be elected. Although just talking about this brings up feelings of terror that remind me why I keep discovering that football games are so relaxing. Bret: Speaking of terror, I was particularly freaked out by a story by our news-side colleague, Giovanni Russonello, based on a study the Pew Research Center just did, which found that some groups that swung toward the Democrats for the 2018 midterms aren't really warming to Joe. One of the most interesting finds was that while Biden has a wide lead over Trump among Hispanic voters, it's still much weaker than Hillary's lead four years ago. And that tracks with a lot of what I hear anecdotally, with fears of future lockdowns. Just keeping the fear-meter high here. Gail: Bret, the one thing that really drives me crazy right now is our obsession with Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Lovely states, but it reminds me that thanks to our electoral system, I can't remember a national election where I thought my New York vote really counted.

Bret: My inner Burkean tells me that abandoning the Electoral College would lead to all kinds of problems we can scarcely anticipate today. But it does seem insane that the most consequential presidential election in decades comes down to what a relative handful of people, mostly white suburbanites in six or seven states, happen to think on the first Tuesday in November. Or, with all the mail-in ballots, sometime in the preceding weeks, assuming their votes get counted. Gail: Someday remind me to tell you the story of why I almost didn't graduate from college with my class at Marquette because my Ethics of Journalism teacher wanted to give me an incomplete. Long ago, but I was thinking the other night that if he'd won that battle I might never have graduated, or left Milwaukee. On election night I'd be so ... popular. Bret: I hope that teacher lived long enough to either apologize or eat his shoe. But back to my freak-out: We may not know the winner on election night, or even for days or weeks after that. If Trump is ahead on election night, he's going to want to declare victory long before all the ballots are counted. If he does that, there is going to be unrest. If vote totals are close in several states, we're going to have a replay of Florida, 2000, but on a much larger scale. You mentioned wildfires, and this just feels like multiple political lightning strikes on millions of acres of dry grass and dead wood. Gail: Yeah, at least in 2000 we were just looking at one state that couldn't get its votes counted. The inefficiency of our election system is a scandal we manage to forget once the crisis is over. Bret: Maybe we can outsource the vote counting to the Netherlands or Taiwan. They wouldn't screw it up. Gail: When you combine it with the inefficiency of the mail, the pandemic, the Trump paranoia -- yikes. The only way we avoid it, I suspect, is if one candidate wins by a landslide. And that, by the way, would make our votes relevant again. If the national popular vote is, say, 60 percent Biden, Trump won't have the traction to resist.

Gail: Sure he could lock himself in his bedroom and refuse to come out, but the world would just go on. A new president would be inaugurated and sooner or later Trump would run out of snacks and be forced to concede. Bret: I like this scenario. Trump tries to pull an Edwin Stanton, but then K.F.C. and McDonald's unite by refusing to deliver and democracy is saved. I see Zach Galifianakis and Jack Black starring in whatever movie they make of this. Gail: And when it comes to a landslide like that, even New York votes would count for something. And I would remember this election forever as the one when my vote actually mattered. Bret: Which raises the question of how Biden can turn this into a romp. I don't think it's going to come from anonymous and disputed claims in the mainstream press that Trump disparaged World War I soldiers. Those sorts of stories just play into the Trumpian narrative that the media can't be trusted. Nor do I think Bob Woodward's revelation that Trump downplayed the virus will make much of a difference: Our own Bill de Blasio was doing much the same thing in early March. Gail: Most New Yorkers would not find ""Bill de Blasio did it, too"" as a good excuse for anything except maybe excessive gym use. But continue ... Bret: What works best against Trump is mockery, not moral thunder. Like, where is the forthcoming best seller, ""The Melania Trump Tell-All (As Told to Whoopi Goldberg)""? And what works best for Biden isn't the moral earnestness of emerging from darkness into light. It's something along the lines of Ronald Reagan's ""there you go again"" riposte to Jimmy Carter, when the Georgian accused the Californian of being a wild-eyed extremist. What are your suggestions for Joe? Gail: Well I'd like to hear him challenge Trump to a push-up competition again. It's an excellent reminder that whenever the president tries to depict Biden as old and doddering, we're talking about a physically fit 77-year-old whose age is being attacked by an out-of-shape 74-year-old.",The Biden campaign and the world it's playing out in are making us all nervous wrecks.,41896eb7-0e8b-59ab-98fd-e70ebd291f22,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/14/opinion/14conversation/14conversation-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=728e61396a5e8cd3daa700bff6cc7fbf0ec0949117cb3d6d8ae95c589ac6bd0c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joseph Biden spoke in Warren, Mich., on Wednesday.",41896eb7-0e8b-59ab-98fd-e70ebd291f22,N24News/imgs/41896eb7-0e8b-59ab-98fd-e70ebd291f22.jpg,11
Education,"In the Age of Information, Specializing to Survive",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/in-the-age-of-information-specializing-to-survive.html,"Jonathan Haber majored in philosophy at Harvard University. And Yale. And Stanford. He explored Kant's ""The Critique of Pure Reason"" with an Oxford don and Kierkegaard's insights into ""Subjectivity, Irony and the Crisis of Modernity"" with a leading light from the University of Copenhagen. In his quest to meet all the standard requirements for a bachelor of arts degree in a single year, the 52-year-old from Lexington, Mass., also took courses in English common law, Shakespeare's late plays and the science of cooking, which overlapped with the degree in chemistry he earned from Wesleyan in 1985. Here's the brilliant part: Mr. Haber didn't spend a dime on tuition or fees. Instead, he gorged from the smorgasbord of free courses offered by top universities. He documented the project on his website, degreeoffreedom.org, and in a new book exploring the wider phenomenon of massive open online courses, or MOOCs. He didn't earn a degree -- the knowledge may be free but the sheepskin costs dearly -- but he was satisfied. ""I wouldn't call myself a philosopher,"" he said, ""but I learned as much as most undergraduates."" Mr. Haber's project embodies a modern miracle: the ease with which anyone can learn almost anything. Our ancient ancestors built the towering Library of Alexandria to gather all of the world's knowledge, but today, smartphones turn every palm into a knowledge palace.

And yet, even as the highbrow holy grail -- the acquisition of complete knowledge -- seems tantalizingly close, almost nobody speaks about the rebirth of the Renaissance man or woman. The genius label may be applied with reckless abandon, even to chefs, basketball players and hair stylists, but the true polymaths such as Leonardo da Vinci and Benjamin Franklin seem like mythic figures of a bygone age. They don't make geniuses like they used to. Perhaps we need another Franklin to explain why. Thanks to the power of technology and the brute force of demographics, the modern world should be teeming with people of wide accomplishment. In Franklin's era, the world's population was about 800 million; today it's seven billion people, many of whom enjoy the brain-building blessings of good nutrition and access to education. Indeed, the researcher James R. Flynn has found that I.Q. scores have been rising around the world for decades. Known as the ""Flynn effect,"" it is especially pronounced in developed nations such as the United States, where average scores have increased about three points per decade since the early 1900s. Nevertheless, it is much easier to feel like Sisyphus than Leonardo nowadays, because one thing that has grown even faster than I.Q. scores is the amount of information the brain must process. Google estimated in 2010 that there were 300 exabytes (that's 300 followed by 18 zeros) of human-created information in the world, and that more information was created every two days than had existed in the entire world from the dawn of time to 2003. No doubt those numbers have increased vastly since then. But does it really matter? Like the physicists' observation that the known universe has a diameter of 92 billion light years, these numbers are so large that they defy human comprehension; they are meaningless truths to just about everybody not named Stephen Hawking. When it comes to aggregate information, we blew our minds long ago. Of course, not all information is equal. Those exabytes do include a few great novels, stirring films and groundbreaking scientific discoveries. Most are flotsam wrapped in jetsam: insipid blog posts and text messages, YouTube videos of cuddly cats and pornographic acts, ignorance that poses as knowledge.

""We are overloaded with junk,"" said Daniel Levitin, a professor of psychology and behavioral neuroscience at McGill University whose books include ""The Organized Mind."" ""It's becoming harder and harder to separate the wheat from the digital chaff. The problem with the Internet is anyone can post, so it's hard to know whether you are looking at a fact or pseudofact, science or pseudoscience."" That problem seems quintessentially modern; Alvin Toffler didn't popularize the term ""information overload"" until 1970. But in the relative realm of human experience, it is as constant and nettlesome as death and taxes. At least since the heyday of ancient Greece and Rome, each generation has confronted the overwhelming struggle to search, sift and sort growing piles of information to make what is known useful. ""Papyrus, print or petabyte -- the history of feeling overwhelmed by information always seems to go back further than the latest technology."" said Seth Rudy, a professor of English literature at Rhodes College who explores this phenomenon in his new book, ""Literature and Encyclopedism in Enlightenment Britain: The Pursuit of Complete Knowledge."" ""The sense that there is too much to know has been felt for hundreds, even thousands, of years."" In response, figures of expert erudition and taste -- such as the Roman Gaius Petronius Arbiter, whose impeccable taste made his name a byword of discernment, and the 19th-century critic Matthew Arnold, who defined culture as ""the best that has been thought and known"" -- have helped distinguish the dross from the gold. Primitive search engines developed in the Middle Ages are still with us, including indexes, concordances and tables of contents, while the dictionary and the florilegium (a compilation of quotations and excerpts from other writings) enabled busy people to sample the world's wisdom. This remains a thriving business; a sales pitch of modern journalism is that reporters and critics do the work (read the book, see the play, try the recipe, interview experts) so you don't have to. Encyclopedias rose in the Enlightenment. Tellingly, Mr. Rudy said, most early works were created by one person and aimed to synthesize all knowledge into a single, coherent body. Soon, they became collections of discrete articles written by a team of experts. By the 20th century, the storehouse of useful knowledge had grown at such a thrillingly alarming rate that the possibility of mastering just one area of study, such as physics, literature or art -- much less to become a Renaissance man who could make important contributions to various fields -- became less aspiration than delusion. Julianne Moore's character captured this sense in the Oscar-winning movie ""Still Alice"" when she joked about ""the great academic tradition of knowing more and more about less and less until we know everything about nothing."" That barb suggests a profound response to the explosion of information that has transformed modern scholarship and innovation: the rise of intense specialization and teamwork. ""Once upon a time you could be a biologist,"" said Benjamin F. Jones, an economist at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University. ""Now the accumulation of knowledge is such that biologists, for example, must specialize in an array of microdisciplines like evolutionary biology, genetics and cell functions.""","As the amount of human-created information spirals ever higher, our ability to sift through it has not kept pace. Increasingly condensed specialization is one result.",016e35a5-bae2-53c8-9d91-8579671bdb4b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/20/education/20KNOWLEDGEJP/20KNOWLEDGEJP-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=c0f4cb7beae8e136d9904cfc502e431a60a3cf263de5a244749522897c1d6d0e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Our ancient ancestors built the Library of Alexandria to gather the world's knowledge, but smartphones turn every palm into a knowledge palace.",016e35a5-bae2-53c8-9d91-8579671bdb4b,N24News/imgs/016e35a5-bae2-53c8-9d91-8579671bdb4b.jpg,22
Books,This Is How It All Ends,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/books/review/the-end-of-everything-katie-mack.html,"Not to give anything away, but ""in about five billion years, the sun will swell to its red giant phase, engulf the orbit of Mercury and perhaps Venus, and leave the Earth a charred, lifeless, magma-covered rock."" That's how  starts her story. It's downhill from there. Many books have been written about our cosmic origins: the creation of the universe 13.8 billion years ago; the Big Bang and all that followed. The denouement, presumably tens of billions of years away, remains comparatively mysterious. How does it all end? For that matter, does it all end, or can we keep on in our merry way indefinitely? In ""The End of Everything: (Astrophysically Speaking),"" Mack, a theoretical cosmologist at North Carolina State University, attempts to answer what might seem the most remote of scientific questions. ""Some say the world will end in fire, / Some say in ice."" She gives Robert Frost his due. She doesn't bother with T. S. Eliot: ""not with a bang but a whimper."" Traditional speculation about the end times, the end of days, comes from religion, where it is called eschatology. Apocalypse, doomsday, Judgment Day -- all this, for theologians, provides a way of thinking about the meaning or purpose of existence. Our destiny, if only we could know it, might provide some reason for why we're here.

The eye of astrophysics reaches a great deal farther now. Cosmologists calculate the curve and complete the figure by employing a potent arsenal of instruments and methodologies. Optical, radio, X-ray and gamma ray telescopes on mountaintops and in space, underground neutrino detectors and gravitational-wave observatories extend our sight to the edges of the universe. But what that really means is that they extend our sight into the past. This is perhaps the most basic fact of cosmology, sometimes taken for granted, and Mack explains it elegantly. Telescope users have a window into time. Light travels at finite speed, so everything comes to us with its own time delay. We see the sun not as it is now but as it was eight minutes ago. All we can know of a galaxy 10 billion light-years away is what it looked like 10 billion years ago, when the universe was young. ""We can look even farther back,"" she writes, ""and see matter swirling into supermassive black holes in a universe less than 500 million years old, when starlight had only just begun to penetrate the darkness between galaxies."" ""The End of Everything"" is a pleasure. Mack's style is personal and often funny as she guides us along a cosmic timeline studded with scientific esoterica and mystery. Most of what astronomers know comes not from seeing but from deduction -- complex ladders of logic, building upon one another. Black holes were first inferred and then understood in more and more detail and now can just barely be said to have been ""seen."" Two of the most crucial components of the current picture of the universe, dark matter and dark energy, are so-called precisely because they are invisible. Scientists say they can see the Big Bang, and they can, in a way, but what they mean is that they can detect via radio telescopes a faint microwave radiation coming from all directions in space -- the remnant of a time when the entire universe was a fast-growing fireball. Astrophysicists' techniques for looking backward through the eons can let them peer into the future, too. The equations of physics run forward as well as back. A picture begins to emerge of the far-future evolution of the universe -- more than one picture, painted in broad strokes by cosmologists with conflicting theories. Mack organizes the current thinking into a handful of scenarios, some more plausible than others.

One is the ""Big Crunch."" We know the universe has been expanding since the Big Bang. That is to say, space itself is expanding: Galaxies, stars and all other things in the cosmos move farther and farther apart. It's possible that the expansion will eventually slow, stop and reverse itself, like a ball thrown up in the air that then comes back down. And then? Catastrophe. High-energy particle jets and radiation from stars condense and ignite a conflagration. ""Nuclear explosions tear through stellar atmospheres, ripping apart the stars and filling space with hot plasma,"" Mack says. ""At this point, things are really very bad."" You can tell she's enjoying this. Alternatively, the expansion keeps on going until everything attenuates and fades into nothingness. This cosmic endgame is the one known as ""heat death."" You've heard of entropy: the inexorable tendency toward disorder described by the second law of thermodynamics. It's entropy that does us in. This scenario is ""a slow and agonizing one,"" Mack says, ""marked by increasing isolation, inexorable decay and an eons-long fade into darkness."" Everything tends toward equilibrium, and equilibrium means death. Stars burn out, galaxies fade into darkness, even black holes evaporate. This notion has been with us since the development of thermodynamics in the 19th century. H. G. Wells visualized it this way in ""The Time Machine"": ""It would be hard to convey the stillness of it. ... The darkness thickened. ... All else was rayless obscurity. ... A horror of this great darkness came on me."" Other possibilities involve dark energy, a still poorly understood business that seems to be the dominant component of our universe. A dark-energy apocalypse could ""tear apart the very fabric of reality, rendering any thinking creatures in the cosmos helpless as they watch their universe being ripped open around them,"" Mack says. Some paths to destruction arise from theories that involve parallel universes lurking in extra dimensions. A so-called ""ekpyrotic"" scenario imagines collisions of ""branes,"" three-dimensional universes ordinarily invisible to one another. At the fringes, the cosmological theories with the best jargon and cleverest names are often the most speculative. Forty years ago, when much of this science was new, the physicist Freeman Dyson complained that some of his colleagues felt it was ""disreputable"" to study our universe's destiny. He urged them to do it anyway. ""If our analysis of the long-range future leads us to raise questions related to the ultimate meaning and purpose of life,"" he wrote, ""then let us examine these questions boldly and without embarrassment."" This might seem like the wrong time for a book peering billions of years into the future to examine the ultimate doom and destruction. We have doom and destruction of our own to worry about, arriving faster and faster. These days many people wake up wondering if we'll make it past November. Plague is rampant. The Arctic Circle is on fire. Still, I found it helpful -- not reassuring, certainly, but mind-expanding -- to be reminded of our place in a vast cosmos. Mack puts it this way: ""When we ask the question, 'Can this all really go on forever?,' we are implicitly validating our own existence, extending it indefinitely into the future, taking stock and examining our legacy."" It seems safe to say, though, that any meaning and purpose will have to be found in ourselves, not in the stars. The cosmic end times will bring no day of judgment, no redemption. All we can expect is the total obliteration of whatever universe remains and any intelligence that still abides there.","In ""The End of Everything,"" the theoretical cosmologist Katie Mack takes a look at the ultimate doom and destruction of our universe. It's not pretty.",4b20f809-be81-510b-b14b-9378000d39c0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/books/review/Gleick1/Gleick1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2571ff49f832d4f909331dc527e2541759db3c11f7ed18a2fe4d1c0a4076d770&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Katie Mack,4b20f809-be81-510b-b14b-9378000d39c0,N24News/imgs/4b20f809-be81-510b-b14b-9378000d39c0.jpg,13
Opinion,Paging Michael Bloomberg,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/opinion/bloomberg-president-2020.html,"My fellow Americans, we face a national emergency. Never before have we had a president so utterly lacking in personal integrity, so able to lie and abuse his powers with such impunity and so blindly backed by an amoral party, an unscrupulous attorney general and a media-fund-raising juggernaut. It is an engine of raw power that will cram anything the president says or does right down your throat. James Carville had it exactly right when he noted on ""Morning Joe"" the other day that the only thing standing in the way of lasting damage by this machine to all that makes America unique and great is the Democrats' nominating the right person to defeat Donald Trump. We have to get this right. This is no ordinary time, no ordinary Republican Party, no ordinary incumbent, and it will require an extraordinary Democratic machine to triumph. Because, without doubt, Russia and China also will be ""voting"" Trump 2020 -- for three reasons: (1) Trump keeps America in turmoil and unable to focus on building the infrastructure we need to dominate the 21st century the way we did the 20th. (2) Both Beijing and Moscow know that Trump is so disliked by America's key allies that he can never galvanize a global coalition against China or Russia. And (3) both Russia and China know that Trump is utterly transactional and will never challenge them on human rights abuses. Trump is their chump, and they will not let him go easily.

So who is the right Democratic candidate? Well, for starters I will tell you who it is not. It is not Bernie Sanders. On which planet in the Milky Way galaxy is an avowed ""socialist"" -- who wants to take away the private health care coverage of some 150 million Americans and replace it with a gigantic, untested Medicare-for-All program, which he'd also extend to illegal immigrants -- going to defeat the Trump machine this year? It will cast Sanders as Che Guevara -- and it won't even be that hard. Yes, the failures of American capitalism to deliver inclusive growth, which have propelled the Sanders campaign and animated his followers, require urgent attention by our next president. But Sanders, in key cases, has the wrong solutions to the right problems. He's the wrong candidate to take down Trump.

Please, Democrats, don't tell me you need Sanders's big, ill-thought-through, revolutionary grand schemes to get inspired and mobilized for this election. You want a revolution? I'll give you a revolution: four more years of Donald Trump, unencumbered by the need to get re-elected. That will be a revolution! And it will do permanent damage to the institutions and norms that have sustained this country since its founding, not to mention our environment, which Trump has been selling off to oil, gas and mining companies at an alarming pace. So, who is the right candidate and what is the right strategy? On strategy, we know the formula that works, because it already has: Appeal to independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women. These are the constituencies that did not like Hillary Clinton and were ready to give Trump a chance in 2016 -- but abandoned him in 2018 and delivered the House of Representatives to the Democrats, and then also two governorships in red states.

If Democrats can choose a candidate who can hold the core Democratic base and also appeal to these same independents, moderate Republicans and suburban women in the key swing states, they can absolutely defeat Trump. How do you do that as a candidate? For starters, by stressing national unity, personal integrity and a willingness to pursue bipartisanship whenever the other side is ready. A lot of Americans are worried sick that Trump is tearing the country in half. As Larry Diamond, editor of The Journal of Democracy, pointed out to me, several studies he's been publishing show that the best way to defeat illiberal populism is not by trying to out-polarize the polarizer in chief but rather through broad, inclusive electoral strategies that pragmatically address the economic and social concerns of voters, including those who had previously voted for the populist. That was the approach that enabled the secular opposition to defeat the party of Turkey's autocratic president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, in municipal elections last year in Istanbul and other cities. A similar depolarizing approach powered the victory of Greece's liberal-centrist New Democracy party over the ruling left-wing populist Syriza in national elections last year. You also do it by repeating every hour every day -- with evidence -- that Trump is out to destroy Obamacare through the courts, which means eliminating its coverage for pre-existing conditions, and only the Democrats will save it and improve it. You do it by not only talking about how to redivide the pie -- which we need to do -- but by also talking about how to grow the pie, how to create more taxpayers and how to inspire more innovators. Ours is a capitalist country. Americans admire successful entrepreneurs. Let's praise job creators and risk-takers -- as long as they and their companies pay their taxes. You want more and better jobs, you need more Steve Jobs. You do it by celebrating the growing economy that Barack Obama reignited and Trump continued, while making clear that it still needs work. Too much of the Trump tax cuts have gone to companies and the most wealthy, with virtually nothing invested in infrastructure -- roads, ports, schools, bandwidth, scientific research -- or affordable housing, which we must have for inclusive prosperity.

You do it by hitting Trump hard on the environment, but not focusing just on ""climate change,"" which is an abstraction for most people. Trump is unfit to serve four more years because of how he has removed so many protections for the water and air America's kids drink and breathe every day. And you do it by supporting a balanced approach to immigration reform -- a high wall, with a big gate. I was glad to see candidates with this kind of message, like Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg, trending better in Iowa and New Hampshire. It showed that lots of Democrats are searching in this direction. But there is one candidate on the Democratic side who not only has a track record of supporting all those issues but also has the resources to build a machine big enough to take on the Trump machine. This candidate also has the toughness to take on Trump, because while Trump was pretending to be a C.E.O. on the show ""The Apprentice,"" this candidate was actually building one of the most admired global companies as a real C.E.O. This candidate is not cuddly, he is not always politically correct and he will not always tell you what you want to hear -- or try to outbid you on how many free services he'll give away. He's made mistakes, especially around stop-and-frisk policing in New York City, which disproportionately targeted black and brown men and for which he recently apologized. His mistakes, though, have to be weighed against a record of courageously speaking out and devoting enormous personal resources to virtually every progressive cause -- gun control, abortion rights, climate change, Planned Parenthood, education reform for predominantly minority schools, affordable housing, income inequality and tax reform. And he has vowed as president to focus on building black wealth, not just ending poverty.

And this candidate knows how to get stuff done -- he can fight this fire at the scale of the fire. His team has for years used social networks to promote progressive issues to centrist and conservative audiences. He won't cede the internet/Facebook/Twitter battlefield to Trump's team, who are killers in that space. And this candidate is now rising steadily in the polls. This candidate is Michael Bloomberg. This candidate has Trump very worried. Yes, Sanders is also polling well against Trump, but the Trump machine has not begun to focus on him yet -- it hasn't begun bombing Facebook with ads about how Sanders honeymooned in the Soviet Union. Sitting here today, Bloomberg -- paired with a progressive vice-presidential candidate who can appeal to Sanders's voters -- has the best chance to carry the day. In an age when political extremists go all the way, and moderates tend to just go away, Bloomberg has the right stuff -- a moderate progressive with a heart of gold but the toughness of a rattlesnake -- for what is going to be an incredibly big, brutal task: making Donald Trump a one-term president.

Global Business,"With Italy and Spain, Further Tests for Europe",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/16/business/global/for-europe-a-return-of-the-jitters.html,"BRUSSELS -- Is the euro crisis back with a vengeance, or do investors have a needless case of anxiety? Until very recently, the gloom over the Continent had seemed to be lifting, with the conclusion of Greece's second bailout and the calming effect on the financial sector of cheap loans from the European Central Bank. But last week's jump in borrowing costs for Spain and Italy provided a clear signal that the euro's problems are far from solved. ""Financial strains in Europe have eased somewhat since December,"" Christine Lagarde, director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech in Washington on Thursday. ""However, events of the past week remind us that markets remain volatile and that turning the corner is never easy."" The turn looks tightest in Spain, which is still under intense pressure from the European Union to narrow a gaping budget deficit and clean up its banking system after a housing bubble burst, even as the country slides back into recession, with roughly one in four workers unemployed.

Yields on Spanish 10-year bonds hit a worrisome level of 6 percent Wednesday for the first time in four months and closed the week nearly that high. At the same time, investors seeking safety drove the 10-year German bond, or bund, to a near-record low of 1.6 percent. Interest rates on Spanish bonds could climb again this week if two debt auctions, scheduled for Tuesday and Thursday, go poorly. Italy, which has an even heavier debt load and is further behind on its refinancing needs for this year, is under similar stress. Neither Spain nor Italy seems a good candidate for meeting the deficit-reduction targets they have agreed to with the European Union, especially if the downturn deepens. Neither do many of the other member states, however, including the Netherlands, traditionally a deficit hawk but now scrambling to find additional savings as its economy falters. Their deficit-trimming will be detailed in the medium-term budget plans that each European Union member must submit to Brussels by the end of the month for vetting under stricter procedures approved last fall. The procedures are intended to catch the kind of slippage that got the euro zone into its current mess.

The verdicts will be based in large part on official indicators of the region's fiscal and economic health to be released over the next few weeks. Those include final debt and deficit figures for 2011 as verified by Eurostat, the union's statistics agency, to be released next Monday, and the European Commission's spring economic forecast, which covers not only growth and inflation expectations, but also deficit and debt figures, to be released on May 11. Countries whose budgets are judged to be off-track will face demands for corrective action, which are now supposed to be harder to avoid. That prospect, however, seems certain to renew debate over whether a regional economy teetering on the brink of recession can withstand a new round of austerity. ""On this the market is entirely schizophrenic,"" said Gilles Moec, an economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ""They complain about growth, and they complain about fiscal policy. Well, you can't have both."" Carsten Brzeski, senior economist at ING Belgium, agrees that European policy makers are in something of a no-win situation right now. But to bend the rules so soon after tightening them, he added, ""would have an enormous negative impact on credibility.""

* Bank regulators released a 'road map' for crypto regulation that is short on details. While the austerity debate simmers, a more pressing concern is efforts by Italy and Spain to raise financing for government debt they will need to roll over this year. Italy has so far raised only a little more than one-third of the estimated 215 billion euros ($281 billion) it will need this year, according to Reuters calculations. Spain is about half of the way to its goal, the economy minister, Luis de Guindos, said last Tuesday. According to the 2012 budget, the Spanish treasury plans gross issuance of 186 billion euros ($243 billion) of debt this year.

That debt-buying is now tapering off, said Guntram Wolff, deputy director at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. That raises the question of who might step in to finance these governments. ""Investors are starting to express big doubts,"" Mr. Wolff said. Few analysts expect the central bank to open the taps again, especially because the earlier moves have already started having unintended consequences. While the loan program was meant chiefly to address an acute financing problem for the banks, it also ended up tying their fate more closely to that of their governments, said Jacques Cailloux, chief European economist at the Royal Bank of Scotland in London. Now that sovereign yields are rising again, he said, the banks are faced with the prospect of large paper losses on their freshly purchased bond holdings, as well as sinking stock prices. Many economists say Spain still needs to fully address the impact of a housing bubble that burst in 2008 in the wake of the global financial crisis. Many homeowners struggle to make payments. And real estate prices still have further to fall, which will force the banks to take more write-offs. The Spanish central bank governor, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, conceded last week that Spanish banks could need more capital if the economy deteriorated. The banks' ""ever-increasing"" losses ""hang like a sword of Damocles over the public sector,"" according to a paper published on Sunday by Cinzia Alcidi and Daniel Gros at the Center for European Policy Studies in Brussels. ""They cannot and should not go on just writing off the absolute minimum,"" Mr. Gros said in an interview. ""Much better to follow the Irish example and have it over with.""

Deutsche Bank estimates that Spanish banks could need about 50 billion euros in additional capital -- more than the banks could probably raise on their own under current market conditions, and more than the Spanish government could afford. That leaves the European Union's newly bolstered bailout fund. Mr. Gros suggested it could lend money directly to the Spanish banks to avoid increasing government debt and avert a full-blown bailout. Still, admitting you need outside help is ""toxic politically"" for any government, said Mr. Moec, the Deutsche Bank economist. ""I don't think they feel cornered yet,"" he added. Italy does not have a housing crash to cope with, or Spain's high level of private debt. But it has a much higher public debt than Spain, similarly anemic growth and a calcified labor market that Prime Minister Mario Monti, a technocrat appointed in November, has struggled to change against an increasingly hostile political environment. In the latest display of Italian public anger, thousands of union members turned out on the streets of Rome on Friday to protest plans to raise the minimum age for a state pension. In such a charged climate, it is little wonder that barbs have started to fly across borders. Mr. Monti has in recent days sought to blame the problems in Spain for the run-up in Italian bond yields, while French President Nicolas Sarkozy, who is running for re-election, has raised hackles in Madrid by suggesting that France could end up like Spain if people voted for his Socialist Party opponent. On Wednesday, Mariano Rajoy, the Spanish prime minister, fired back, calling on European leaders to be ""more cautious in their statements."" ""We don't talk about other countries,"" he told members of his Popular Party in Madrid. ""We wish other E.U. and euro zone countries the best.""","The gloom over the Continent had seemed to be lifting, but a jump in borrowing costs for two countries signaled clearly that the euro's problems are far from solved.",8edf326a-500f-5419-8887-d463c84bc8c8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/16/business/16Euro/16Euro-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=388&w=600&s=6fb813b8513da89ed7691f418c40f07c32ea2976d12966785d0271aba19fb4cd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Workers protested plans to raise the minimum age for a state pension at the Colosseum in Rome on Friday.,8edf326a-500f-5419-8887-d463c84bc8c8,N24News/imgs/8edf326a-500f-5419-8887-d463c84bc8c8.jpg,24
Real Estate,Rising Rents Create a Demand for Manhattan Walk-Up Buildings,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/realestate/commercial/manhattan-walk-up-buildings-draw-buyers-as-rents-rise.html,"The Benchmark Real Estate Group acquired the 22-unit walk-up building at 156 Sullivan Street in SoHo for just over $6 million last year. It is now in contract to sell the rental building for $12.5 million. ""When we bought it, the rent rolls were about $300,000, but after renovating the apartments and pushing up rents, it is now generating $1 million,"" said Jordan D. Vogel, co-founder of the company with Aaron Feldman. Benchmark is pursuing an increasingly popular strategy in New York City's investment sales market: the acquisition of small walk-up buildings across Manhattan. While walk-ups have never been the most glamorous buildings in the city, demand for and sales of these buildings have reached new highs recently. There were 71 sales of walk-up buildings in Manhattan in the second quarter of this year, compared with just 33 in the second quarter of 2009, according to data from the brokerage firm Eastern Consolidated. In the first half of this year, sales volume for these multifamily properties reached nearly $640 million, a 205 percent increase from the $210 million reached in the first half of 2009.

The popularity and rising prices of walk-ups are owed in no small part to Manhattan's incredibly tight rental market. Rents have been surging for the last several years as New Yorkers remain skittish about buying homes and mortgages remain difficult to obtain. In June, for example, the average rent was $3,443 a month, according to Citi Habitats, the highest figure since the firm began tracking data in 2002. With rents rising, the fact that many Manhattan walk-up buildings have tenants with rent-regulated apartments offers landlords the possibility of a very large increase in profits when these units are deregulated and shift to market rates. There is also upside potential to raise rents in the market rate units if landlords renovate a walk-up building, many of which have not been modernized in decades. There are about 40,000 rent-controlled and one million rent-stabilized units in New York City, with complex rules regulating them. In the case of rent stabilization, the leases can be renewed and the rent increased at a rate determined annually by the city's Rent Guidelines Board. In some cases, rent-regulated apartments can be deregulated when a tenant dies, and landlords are not reluctant to gauge a building's prospects by taking note of tenants' ages, said Adelaide Polsinelli, a senior director at Eastern Consolidated. ""A landlord will look at a building and if it has, say, 100 units and 30 of them are occupied by tenants who are in their 50s or 60s, they know the end could be in sight,"" she said. Lenders, who remain risk-averse in this economy, like buildings with rent-regulated units because ""the rents are already the worst-case scenario,"" Ms. Polsinelli said. She added that mortgage rates for these properties can be as low as 2.9 or 3 percent, compared with as much as 5 percent for offices and 8 percent for new development. She has brokered several of these deals in the last year, including last month, when she represented the seller of two five-story walk-up buildings at 521 and 523 East 12th Street for $10.9 million.

""We think that there are a lot of potential tenants who are coming out of high-end rental buildings with doormen and elevators that are looking for a similar feel but at a more affordable price,"" said Martin Nussbaum, the company's founder. To capture this market, Silverstone is renovating the 82nd Street buildings with marble tile, crown moldings, sophisticated intercom systems and amenities like a basement laundry room and gym. It is also upgrading plumbing and electrical work, and providing market rate units with stainless steel appliances and recessed lighting. ""It is very capital-intensive for the first two years or so. Then, hopefully, we will see a significant increase in rent,"" Mr. Nussbaum said, adding that he acquires only buildings that have a minimum of 50 percent free-market apartments and where the leases are to expire within a year of acquisition. Another reason that investors like buying walk-up buildings is that they ""operate more efficiently and at a lower expense level than an elevator building, while the market rents are not that much less,"" said Peter Hauspurg, the chairman and chief executive of Eastern Consolidated. According to Citi Habitats, a one-bedroom in a walk-up building in Manhattan rented for an average of $2,602 in July, $366 less than a similar size unit in an elevator building.

* Hidden Feats: Our critic looks at some supertall N.Y.C. buildings and how the ingenuity of engineers helped build landmarks. Buying a walk-up can also be a better alternative than acquiring a small office building, Mr. Hauspurg said. In an office building, the landlord has to provide a new tenant with tenant improvement allowances, pay the brokerage fee, offer some free rent, ""and then if the small business went out of business, you have to replace the tenant with all the same expenditures,"" he said.

In a walk-up rental building, on the other hand, ""there is no brokerage fee because the tenant pays it and no down time because any apartment will rent within 30 days if it is priced right."" But acquiring walk-up rentals in Manhattan can be very difficult right now because of fierce competition among buyers. ""I have toured 240 properties, made offers on 80 and bought only 16, so my batting average is terrible,"" Mr. Vogel said. ""Today there is a plethora of buyers, debt is at its all-time low in terms of rates and it is hard to find deals."" Michael Forrest, the chief executive of Forrest Partners, started his company in 2007 but has not made an acquisition since 2009. ""I was waiting to see if there was going to be any discounts or deals during the recession, but I never really saw pricing drop, so I sat on the sidelines,"" he said. ""I didn't want to be the guy who bought a property and six months later the prices bottom out."" Forrest Partners owns six buildings on the Lower East Side with a total of 100 apartments and nine stores, ""and if I want to buy more, I realize I'm going to have to pay up,"" he said. While interest rates are low, banks are requiring investors to put significant equity into deals. At 156 Sullivan Street, for example, Benchmark invested $8.2 million to acquire the building and complete the renovations, but the bank financed only $2.9 million of that total, Mr. Vogel said. ""In 2007, you would have done that deal and put in just $500,000 of equity,"" he said, adding that in the three years since the company was founded, Benchmark has invested $75 million in equity to acquire and renovate its portfolio of 16 properties. Still, investors are crowding into this market. ""It is an extension of the enormous capital that wants to be in Manhattan; I have never seen such a flood as in the last few years,"" said Mr. Hauspurg of Eastern Consolidated. ""Buying a walk-up building is a way for new investors to dip their toe in the pond without spending hundreds of millions of dollars and still get something with a lot of upside and not much downside.""","While walk-ups have never been the most glamorous buildings in the city, their growing popularity is owed in no small part to Manhattan's incredibly tight rental market.",ca40d4fb-4a92-5919-a1d6-f91bc929a772,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/22/business/Walkup/Walkup-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=12cc66fc8cc8f13b2ca251f53f3fbfa6f4ed48b259e5384a829fe9399841392a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Silverstone Property Group is renovating two buildings it recently acquired at 162 and 164 East 82nd Street.,ca40d4fb-4a92-5919-a1d6-f91bc929a772,N24News/imgs/ca40d4fb-4a92-5919-a1d6-f91bc929a772.jpg,7

More than ever, pods and podlike chairs are necessary refuges in busy work environments.

Today's open-plan office, where executives might sit shoulder-to-shoulder with underlings, is no longer defined by a desk. Work happens over coffee, or lounging on sofas, or waiting for elevators, or in teleconferences, and too often with headphones. The question is not just how to harness creativity, but where.

Workers still need places where sights and sounds are buffered and secrets kept. And so we have the proliferation of the pod, or its more informal cousin, the noise-damping chair. Islands of privacy in a sea of (over) sharing, they are the ultimate office retreat.","In today's open work space, employees are searching for private places — and designers are too.",dd6365bd-2f48-53cd-97f4-33852c4956c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/21/style/21sp-pods-11/21sp-pods-11-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5ae0bf0eaf738c3c58495236d2e80ea627415bbddba30529a6c1e93736697092&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Overlay, designed by Ayse Birsel and Bibi Seck for Herman Miller.",dd6365bd-2f48-53cd-97f4-33852c4956c9,N24News/imgs/dd6365bd-2f48-53cd-97f4-33852c4956c9.jpg,15
Sports,The Champions League's New Twist: Injury Roulette,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/11/sports/soccer/champions-league-injuries.html,"The procession was nearly over. Ninety-five of the 96 games that constitute the group phase of the Champions League, six weeks of phony war that largely serve to check boxes, cross Ts and dot Is, were complete. Most of the heavyweights had long since advanced to the knockout rounds. As is so often the case, there had been precious little drama. The whole exercise only served to fuel to the flames of those who would revamp the competition or abandon it altogether. Bayern Munich and Manchester City dropped only two points. Juventus, Barcelona, Chelsea and Sevilla qualified with two games to spare, Liverpool and Borussia Dortmund with one. And yet, with five minutes of injury time still to play in the one game outstanding, it felt a little like everything was on the line.

At the same moment, on the outskirts of Madrid, Borussia Monchengladbach's game with Real Madrid had been over for some time. Real Madrid had won comfortably, guaranteeing its inevitable progress to the knockout rounds. Monchengladbach, by contrast, had to wait. Its players and coaching staff huddled around laptops and phones, aware that a goal of any stripe in Milan would extinguish their flickering hope of advancing. And then it was over. Inter's players slumped and shrugged, all of that effort in vain. Castro -- again, a little unexpectedly -- celebrated. And in Madrid, Borussia Monchengladbach's squad poured back out onto the field, swirling their jerseys in the air and bounding for joy.

It was a moment worth savoring, even for those without a direct connection to any of the clubs involved. Much of the criticism of the Champions League group phase is warranted. It does, largely, simply confirm what we already know: a prolonged and dispiriting trudge to a conclusion that is essentially predetermined by the game's financial imbalances. This year was no different. In the final week, the handful of traditional favorites who had left it late pulled through. Real Madrid, despite losing home and away to Shakhtar, finished on top of its group. Atletico Madrid eased past RB Salzburg. Paris St.-Germain swept aside Istanbul Basaksehir, though by the time it did so the sport itself felt very much like an afterthought. Of the superpowers in peril, only Manchester United fell by the wayside, and even that felt like a special case. Historically and financially, United might be far superior to RB Leipzig, but anyone with even a passing knowledge of the way the clubs came by their current managers -- one after years of learning a craft and honing his skills, one because he scored a very important goal 21 years ago -- would have realized that did not quite paint the whole picture. But while those five minutes in Milan and Madrid should not invalidate that criticism, it would be disingenuous not to acknowledge it. That the fate of three teams rested on whether a single goal could be scored in injury time of the last of 96 games to finish -- that the group phase, essentially, was live until its very last kick -- is no mean feat. Quite what all of that means for the remainder of the competition is unclear. The group stage, of course, is never an especially reliable barometer. In some years, the team that shines brightest in the early exchanges maintains that form: Bayern Munich's victory, for example, was preceded by the most imperious group stage in the competition's history. But that is more of an exception than a rule. In 2019, Liverpool lost three games in the group phase, finished second to P.S.G., and then went and won it. The previous year, Real Madrid failed to beat Tottenham Hotspur, home or away, and ended up as champion. The season before that, Zinedine Zidane's Madrid tied three games -- including one against Legia Warsaw -- and qualified second in its pool. It finished the season in rather better form.

That is, of course, because of the genius of the Champions League's structure. Its length -- spread over the span of a season -- rewards the most consistent teams, as a straight league might. But there is an often unacknowledged degree of randomness to it, too: All it takes is one bad night in the knockout round and even the best team will fall. That randomness seems more pronounced than usual this year. The teams that traditionally populate the tournament's stages all appear flawed: Barcelona seems haunted, diminished; Real Madrid's sheen has dulled; P.S.G. waxes and wanes; Juventus has a rookie coach; Liverpool is beset by injury, Manchester City caught between two iterations of Pep Guardiola's ideas. In most circumstances, that would point only in one direction. Bayern Munich is, without question, the best team in Europe. Hansi Flick's side has barely blinked since completing the treble over the summer. If anything, thanks to the addition of Leroy Sane, it carries more threat than it did when it beat P.S.G. in Lisbon.

In England, France and Italy, there are 10 league games scheduled between now and the end of January, as well as at least two rounds of domestic cup matches. In Spain, there are nine La Liga dates, and three rounds of the Copa del Rey. Only in Germany is the schedule notably lighter. That should, theoretically, play into Bayern's hands: Flick's team will have had a chance to recuperate while all the contenders for its crown must play on. But still, it faces eight Bundesliga games and one round of the German Cup. It has a winter break, but the usual three weeks has been cut to only 10 days. It is not, in other words, a Champions League that will be decided by the brightest ideas or the most inspirational coach. It will be determined, instead, by who copes best with the demands of this long, draining winter. The Champions League's eventual winner may not be the team with the best players, but the one with the most left standing once March and April hover into view. The odds, of course, suggest that will still be Bayern Munich or Manchester City or P.S.G.; their squads, after all, are rather better able to cope with absence than those not blessed with their bottomless resources. But it offers a glimmer, too, to those ordinarily cast as makeweights that this year, perhaps, might just be a little less of a procession.

It has, by now, become part of the ritual of pretty much every professional game in English soccer. The teams troop out on to the field. The players fan out into their positions. The referee blows his whistle. And then, just as they have every day since soccer restarted in June, the players -- uniformly -- take a knee. Something so commonplace quickly becomes unremarkable, even if it is, by its very nature, wholly remarkable. English soccer has been taking the knee for six months: a unified, ongoing, social commentary/political statement* devised and perpetuated by a group of young men usually encouraged to be as detached and apolitical as possible. In that time, it has been possible to wonder if the gesture had lost its power, whether it had, effectively, become no more meaningful than the anti-racist slogans so beloved of corporate soccer. It was easy to see it as a way of saying something, not doing something. The fact that it happened after the referee had blown the whistle turned it from protest into something condoned, and therefore controlled. Last weekend, the first in which a handful of fans had been allowed to return to watch English soccer in person in months, Millwall's fans loudly and immediately jeered the sight of their players -- as well as those of the club's opponent, Derby County -- taking the knee.","With muscle injuries rising and an unforgiving, pandemic-compressed schedule looming, Europe might not crown its best team this season, but the one that's still standing.",e29dcd66-251e-507e-af90-f8980d53ef25,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/13/sports/11rorynewsletter2-mbappe-print/11rorynewsletter-mbappe-facebookJumbo.jpg,"For Kylian Mbapp&eacute; and other stars, injury looms as a formidable Champions League foe.",e29dcd66-251e-507e-af90-f8980d53ef25,N24News/imgs/e29dcd66-251e-507e-af90-f8980d53ef25.jpg,9

* None  

It's only two weeks after Thanksgiving. A little early to have to contend with a new overstuffed turkey. And yet, here is ""Jumanji: The Next Level."" This is the sequel to a 2017 reboot (again directed by Jake Kasdan), which connected mightily with audiences. In that movie, a quartet of teens got sucked into a video game that assigned them avatars, which also served as virtual life coaches. Wimpy Spencer got to inhabit Dwayne Johnson (a.k.a. the Rock), while shy Martha got to kick butt in Karen Gillan's body. Self-absorbed Bethany got a soft comeuppance being Jack Black. And ""Fridge,"" a giant jock, got cut down to Kevin Hart's stature. Here, on winter break, downhearted Spencer -- his life hack didn't quite take -- has dug up the game and re-entered its world. His friends try to follow, but only a couple make it in. They are joined by Eddie, Spencer's crotchety grandfather (a delightfully dyspeptic Danny DeVito) and Eddie's estranged best pal, Milo (a warm Danny Glover). Yes, Eddie does wind up in Dwayne Johnson's body, which affords Johnson the opportunity to try a New Jersey accent. It's not bad. This all sounds more complicated than it plays out onscreen, which is to Kasdan's credit. Adding to the twists is a body of water that enables avatar-switching; it reintroduces itself at a crucial story point, as one does. At another crucial point, the actress and rapper Awkwafina shows up to join in the ostensible fun; at another, Colin Hanks and Nick Jonas reprise their roles from the prior movie. It's perhaps unfair to call this a turkey. It's got some sweet moments, and the cast, as it did in the previous picture, enjoys itself at least semi-infectiously. But the action sequences are lifeless; the lessons valid but arguably stale; and the trimmings, mere bloat.","Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan return for this sequel, and they've got Danny DeVito and Danny Glover in tow.",aa7c999e-51ec-5dd9-a176-7212a3fdd292,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/arts/12jumanji-art/12jumanji-art-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=54a52867fe7e8c394c612ab146127a9c0ab631317e2d5b770069e41203826573&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black and Karen Gillan in ""Jumanji: The Next Level.""",aa7c999e-51ec-5dd9-a176-7212a3fdd292,N24News/imgs/aa7c999e-51ec-5dd9-a176-7212a3fdd292.jpg,5
Health,Robert De Niro Defends Screening of Anti-Vaccine Film at Tribeca Festival,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/26/health/vaccines-autism-robert-de-niro-tribeca-film-festival-andrew-wakefield-vaxxed.html,"In a decision that has dredged up the widely debunked link between vaccines and autism, the Tribeca Film Festival plans to screen a film by a discredited former doctor whose research caused widespread alarm about the issue. The film, ""Vaxxed: From Cover-Up to Catastrophe,"" is directed and co-written by Andrew Wakefield, an anti-vaccination activist and an author of a study -- published in the British medical journal The Lancet, in 1998 -- that was retracted in 2010. In addition to the retraction of the study, which involved 12 children, Britain's General Medical Council, citing ethical violations and a failure to disclose financial conflicts of interest, revoked Mr. Wakefield's medical license. On the festival's website, the biographical material about Mr. Wakefield does not mention that he was stripped of his license or that his Lancet study was retracted. Rather, it says that the Lancet study ""would catapult Wakefield into becoming one of the most controversial figures in the history of medicine.""

Mr. De Niro's statement seemed to suggest that this was the first time he has expressed a preference that a particular film be shown at the festival. ""Grace and I have a child with autism,"" he wrote, referring to his wife, Grace Hightower De Niro, ""and we believe it is critical that all of the issues surrounding the causes of autism be openly discussed and examined. In the 15 years since the Tribeca Film Festival was founded, I have never asked for a film to be screened or gotten involved in the programming. However this is very personal to me and my family and I want there to be a discussion, which is why we will be screening VAXXED."" Within hours his statement, posted on Facebook, generated hundreds of comments. The trailer for the film, filled with dramatic music, opens with the words ""Are Our Children Safe?"" on a black screen with billowing smoke that appears to be coming from a syringe. The trailer includes the suggestion that a ""whistle-blower"" from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention would say that the organization ""had committed fraud"" and ""that they knew that vaccines were actually causing autism."" Mr. Wakefield appears in the trailer saying, ""Wow, the C.D.C. had known all along there was this M.M.R. autism risk.""

M.M.R. stands for the vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella that children 12 to 15 months old are supposed to receive. Scientific evidence has repeatedly shown the vaccine to be safe, highly effective and having no connection to autism. In recent years, serious outbreaks of measles have erupted, including one at Disneyland, partly because many parents have refused to vaccinate their children. The plan to show the film has unnerved and angered doctors, infectious disease experts and even other filmmakers. ""Unless the Tribeca Film Festival plans to definitively unmask Andrew Wakefield, it will be yet another disheartening chapter where a scientific fraud continues to occupy a spotlight and overshadows the damage he has left behind in the important story of vaccine safety and success,"" Dr. Mary Anne Jackson, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, said in an email. The documentary filmmaker Penny Lane (""Our Nixon"") published on Thursday an open letter to the festival's organizers in Filmmaker Magazine, suggesting that including ""Vaxxed"" in the documentary section ""threatens the credibility of not just the other filmmakers in your doc slate, but the field in general."" She added that while the subject of ethics and truthfulness in a documentary can be uncomfortable, ""this film is not some sort of disinterested investigation into the 'vaccines cause autism' hoax; this film is directed by the person who perpetuated the hoax."" Dr. William Schaffner, a professor of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University Medical School, called the decision to show the film ""particularly sad"" because the Tribeca festival receives attention far beyond New York.

""The people who put on the Tribeca Film Festival are very prestigious and they draw a very thoughtful audience, and it's implicit that if they have suggested this film they think that there's some merit in it, and more importantly, merit to Wakefield's message,"" Dr. Schaffner said. ""All of us are out talking about it reassuring parents, children, anyone who wants to pay attention to this issue that vaccines are safe and effective, and they certainly do not cause autism, and that Dr. Wakefield was a fraud and had his license removed over this very event."" According to the festival's website, ""Vaxxed"" will be screened only once, on April 24, the festival's closing day. A talk with the director and the film's subjects will follow.","The decision to screen the movie, which was directed by a former doctor whose medical license was revoked, has reignited a debate about autism and vaccines.",acf6d7b6-5ac6-5624-92f6-84f23123295a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/26/science/26VACCINE/26VACCINE-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=617cb2e6166100ae10252cdd18ee2d0e449ba77570c4b46a6e48f38fb36b9fdc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert De Niro and his wife, Grace Hightower De Niro, in January.

Style,"Betsey Johnson: A Role Model, Still",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/style/betsey-johnson-a-role-model-still.html,"Fifty years ago, the designer Betsey Johnson -- part rebel, part cheerleader -- got herself from proper Connecticut to New York City, as many a respectable female adventurer was wont to do. She arrived in Manhattan by way of a 1964 Mademoiselle magazine guest editorship. (She was in good company: Joan Didion and Sylvia Plath preceded her.) But that wasn't the New York she was searching for. She had been staying at the white-gloved Barbizon Hotel for Women, and knew there was another New York. Soon she found it: the dark new bohemia that was just then supplanting the earnest folk-singing scene of Macdougal Street. She was home. This world, dripping with dissoluteness and a belief in the redemptive value of danger, coincided with the debut of a revolutionary new clothing consortium called Paraphernalia. Ms. Johnson, hiding her normalcy under a stark Vidal Sassoon haircut and layers of fake eyelashes, became its star designer. Her dresses were fairy-tale clothes for girls who skipped on the wild side.And as a soon-to-be regular wearer of those dresses, I would add that we wanted to walk wild for some emotional good, not tragic ill, we expected to get out of it all -- for some incandescence in our souls that would match the incandescent in those dresses. It's hard to describe just how Ms. Johnson's clothes defined us, but let me try. For one, they amped up the youthquake gimmick of the time, but they also shifted gears and went romantic, with voluminous sleeves and ribboned, shirred necklines -- apt, since coming to New York alone and female was all about romance. They toggled from skimpy silver minis (perfect for discotheques like the Electric Circus and the Scene) to ankle-length skirts that acknowledged the new counterculture's fondness for medieval gowns. Edie Sedgwick was a fitting model; Julie Christie, an avid customer. A trip to London ""flipped my whole thing,"" remembers Ms. Johnson, now 72, as we talk in her West 30s showroom. Racks of clothes are everywhere; dozens of tutus suspended on ceiling hooks; her eyes bright beneath her egg-yolk-yellow-striped mop of glossy vanilla hair. She was dazzled by the ""sexy and edgy and romantic"" Biba boutique, run by the Polish designer Barbara Hulanicki. She waited in line the two hours it often took to get into Biba each day and marveled at ""the Edwardian high hats and glamorous, feminine 'Elvira Madigan' gowns and the Art Nouveau prints and the tight Lurex turtlenecks.""

At Paraphernalia, Ms. Johnson's first hit was a set of three nylon microskirts: Day-Glo pink, green and yellow, crunched up in a tennis-ball can. Then came her silver motorcycle jacket. In the mid-to-late 1960s, her clothes punched your membership ticket in a chick elite: not for us, the coming-to-New York of that older generation, with ""straight"" jobs, roommates in high-rises and a thirst for engagement rings. The clothes signaled a sea change. ""When I wore my Betsey micro-mini crossing 39th Street at First Avenue, the truck drivers coming out of the Midtown Tunnel would go crazy,"" the actress Ali MacGraw recalled. ""We were so different from the depressing society ladies with their Diana Vreeland s-curved posture in their Courregeses."" The folk-singing queen Judy Collins said: ""I still have Betsey's crushed velvet jacket, in black and bright fuchsia. In fact, I'm wearing the black one at the moment.""

Ms. Johnson designed dresses for the girl who had fled Mayberry for the edgiest quarter of Manhattan to erase her former self. (""I didn't want anyone to know I didn't do drugs,"" she said.) I fled to New York a few years after Ms. Johnson did. One day after the semester was out at the University of California, Berkeley, I sat, all alone, in a plane filled with soldiers en route to Vietnam, singularly compelled to take a reverse migration I barely understood myself. Once I touched down, I picked as a long-term boyfriend an older man who had swapped girlfriends with Norman Mailer and Timothy Leary. (He also took my money and bedded other women, but that seemed at the time like a part of the process of becoming darkly, resplendently world-weary.) I got a job as a fashion assistant at a new glossy that Hearst was starting for the counterculture. It was called Eye, and it was a magical place, all the more so as few people remember it. Tom Wolfe and Gay Talese and Nora Ephron wrote for us. The art department girls were cocky and beatific, as if cutting and pasting bits of swirling psychedelic typeface was a completely uninteresting part of their personal cosmic order. A regular photographer was Linda Eastman: leggy, busty, impatient. Midpoint between being the receptionist at Town & Country magazine and wedding Paul McCartney, she was dating some of the rock stars she photographed, and they sometimes swaggered into the office, tie-dyed scarves looped around their messy-long-hair-dusted necks. The Eye offices were also next door to the loft where Ms. Johnson then lived with the Velvet Underground's John Cale. I visited and interviewed her there; we featured her clothes in our layouts almost every month.

Ms. Johnson tells me it was love of ballet that first brought her, the daughter of an iron foundry owner and a homemaker in ""sweet, WASP, white-picket-fence"" Wethersfield, Conn., to the big city. Her childhood ballet teacher ferried her to the city on weekends for recitals, but when ballet became too competitive, she, who could sew almost as soon as she could walk, threw herself into dance-costume making. After graduating from Syracuse, she won the highly competitive guest editorship at Mademoiselle. Edie Locke (whom Ms. Johnson has for decades called ""my fashion mommy"") was the magazine's fashion editor; she saw where Ms. Johnson was headed: ""She was not a 'nice Connecticut girl'! She was born to be a hippie: bubbly, crazy and irrepressible."" To supplement her $62-a-week Mademoiselle paycheck, Ms. Johnson started designing a Biba-inspired ""great, tight, little silver lame T-shirt,"" Ms. Locke recalls. So many assistants clamored to buy them, the magazine offered them in its shopping column. Ms. Johnson found herself making three or four T-shirts every night and 10 on the weekend. Soon, the fashion businessman Paul Young told Ms. Locke about a Biba-like store he was opening on Madison. He wanted the best young designers. ""We had to lose Betsey,"" Ms. Locke says. ""If we kept her, we'd be holding her back."" Ms. Johnson spent her days at Paraphernalia and her nights at Max's Kansas City, the nucleus as she puts it, of ""this sparkler of a world."" (Young women quit publishing and advertising jobs in droves to be Max's waitresses.) ""It was this capsule -- this tent -- of impassioned, driven, crazy-great but crazy-with-an-idea people,"" she said. ""We all congregated there."" Jerry Schatzberg came with his girlfriend, Faye Dunaway, then unknown. John Ford, a handsome fashion designer, came in daily with his two Irish wolfhounds. Bob Dylan's manager, Albert Grossman, brought Janis Joplin. Andy Warhol held court in the back room. Twiggy, Veruschka and Lauren Hutton were there alongside Paul Morrissey and Robert Rauschenberg and Brigitte Bardot. John Lennon and Yoko Ono slumped in a booth for privacy. The bar was the province of the brawling sculptor John Chamberlain; there were lots of amphetamine-fueled Social Register exiles vamping about, and the rumpled junkie every girl wanted to save was that bard of exquisite two-minute love songs, Tim Hardin.

Ms. Johnson moved into the Chelsea Hotel, and its basement became her workroom. She fell hard for Mr. Cale, who was living there with the stunning Nico: ""He was beautiful, brilliant, crazy and the funniest guy I'd ever been with."" She designed for the Velvets -- Cale and his partner Lou Reed -- and because she'd never done men's wear before, she relished the compliment: ""Lou said I cut a really good crotch."" ""We both recognized something going on between us: Our focus on work was a kind of loneliness,"" Mr. Cale says. When he visited her parents in Connecticut, ""they were like, 'What?' But they were ready for me; she was doing things to shock them all her life."" They married in 1968, ""with everybody from the Factory"" present, Mr. Cale says. In their LaGuardia Place loft, ""we were two little pipe-and-slippers kids,"" Ms. Johnson says. ""We loved each other, we each just wanted a friend."" They tried to act suburban-married. ""I cooked pot roasts on Sunday!"" But the scene was not a perfect fit. Within several years, they had separated. But they have remained friends all these subsequent decades. Ms. Johnson was looking ahead for new things to do as the decade was about to turn. As for me, in that muggy black summer of 1969, while Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and Ted Kennedy left a girl dead in the water off Chappaquiddick, I moved to Ibiza, where you could pretend that living with no electricity or indoor plumbing among beautiful people and savvy drug dealers was a healing experience. I sent my quixotic dispatches to Jann Wenner, who published them in his Eye-eclipsing Rolling Stone. I came back to New York 10 months later. It was 1970. If you've ever lived an earlier portion of your life in a manner that can't be explained without your sounding certifiable, you've probably collected examples of other women, real and fictional -- they've Velcro'd themselves to your psyche, out of defensiveness and comfort -- who exemplified the vaporous spirit of the age that governed the life you desired at the time.

In my collection are: Sue Graham leaving the bland, white Dakotas for New York City ... and Charles Mingus; Susanna Moore's masochistic female writer in her downtown-based novel ""In the Cut""; the novelist Rachel Kushner's tough-California-""Alice""-tumbled-down-the-rabbit-hole-of-the-All-Irony-'70s-New-York-art-scene in her ""The Flamethrowers""; the sneering, guiltless older-musician-on-young-girl demi-molestation struggled with by the wounded, rapier-witted West 10th Street teenage vixen in Dylan Landis's novel ""Rainey Royal."" And the songs in Laura Nyro's ""Eli and the Thirteenth Confession."" When I first heard its haunting opening track, ""Timer,"" during my dazzling tumult, I almost fell on the floor in absolution. My nutty choice of boyfriend was sanctified into a spiritual journey. One of the first things I did when I got back to town was rush over to Paraphernalia to buy some new dresses, one of them a forest green velvet, collared and cap-sleeved dance frock. The dress sent the message: You can make your own romance, and live it, and thrive. I asked Ms. Johnson, all these decades later, ""That was yours, right?"" ""Yes!"" she said. Ms. Johnson, ahead of the curve, had by then started her Alley Cat line, which lasted for four years, while also participating in the opening of Betsey Bunky Nini, long a trendy boutique on the Upper East Side. In 1978, Ms. Johnson and business partner Chantal Bacon started Betsey Johnson, the namesake brand that was built into 60 boutiques worldwide. She would push on and prevail, all the way through to this current decade. (How many people have had a steady design career for 50 years?) Breast cancer wouldn't stop her. Three divorces wouldn't stop her. Nor would single motherhood -- her daughter, Lulu, 39, is her best friend. Chapter 11 wouldn't stop her, in a business that ""builds you up and spits you out and knocks you down,"" as Fern Mallis, the former executive director of the Council of Fashion Designers of America describes the industry. ""She just endures,"" Ms. Mallis said. ""She keeps on ticking."" Ms. Johnson branded herself long before others: She'd made the ballet skirt over a leotard her signature dress, and she made her spiky white-blond hair and huge, red-lipped smile her signature look. She performed a cartwheel at the end of her runway shows (she does to this day). She racked up accolades: the Coty Award, the Pratt Institute Award, the CFDA's Timeless Talent Award, several lifetime achievement prizes.

With her new business partner, the shoe king Steve Madden, and as creative director of her namesake brand (whose name Mr. Madden purchased in 2010), she is licensing dresses, sleepwear, jewelry, bedding, handbags, footwear, fragrance. She just did a stint on ""Dancing With the Stars."" Ms. Johnson designed for good girls who wanted to seem wild but who could turn back at zero hour, girls who knew that no adventure was really dangerous as long as you kept your wits and your work ethic. We wanted to bury our ingenue selves, and she became one of the first New York women at a very convenient noir moment when the available means for such burial were copious -- as were, if you were smart and lucky, the means for self-reclamation. She found them both. And then, like any good seamstress, she cut the pattern for the rest of us.","For a generation of women new to both New York and adulthood, there was no more exciting designer than Ms. Johnson. Fifty years later, she maintains that sway.",d7bd1843-5fc6-5a3e-8912-367734ce81d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/fashion/15BETSYJP1/15BETSYJP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=6e9a2e85a3e23de5293c6b54d86c888fe1a1dd82e045bbfd02477afc8adeb255&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Betsey Johnson in her studio in December wearing a vintage child-size skeleton costume.,d7bd1843-5fc6-5a3e-8912-367734ce81d1,N24News/imgs/d7bd1843-5fc6-5a3e-8912-367734ce81d1.jpg,15
Books,France's Obsession With Decline Is a Booming Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/03/books/france-michel-onfray-decadence.html,"PARIS -- Michel Onfray, a best-selling French pop philosopher, was sounding pretty upbeat on the phone, even though the title of his latest book is ""Decadence: The Life and Death of the Judeo-Christian Tradition."" His book had just come out, with an impressive press run of 120,000 copies, and was selling briskly in spite of -- or perhaps because of -- its gloomy prognostication. ""If you think today about terrorism, the rise of populism, it was important to put that in perspective,"" Mr. Onfray said recently. His research, he added, ""shows a civilization that had been strong, that had ceased to be so and that's heading toward its end."" Mr. Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France's booming decline industry, a spate of books and articles (with a handful of TV shows) that explore the country's (and the West's) failings and France's obsession with those failings. (Last year, the word ""declinisme,"" or ""declinism,"" entered France's Larousse dictionary.) It's a phenomenon that cuts across the political spectrum and has picked up velocity in recent years by tapping into an anxious national mood. And its loudest voices are intellectuals with platforms in the national news media. Beyond Mr. Onfray's, other books with decline on their minds have appeared in the past few weeks. ""The Returned,"" a best seller by the journalist David Thomson, is an investigative report about French jihadists who've returned home from Syria. ""A Submissive France: Voices of Defiance"" compiles interviews on France's troubled banlieues, or suburbs, overseen by the historian Georges Bensoussan. ""Chronicles of French Denial,"" by the right-leaning economist and historian Nicolas Baverez, is about how France continued its economic decline under President Francois Hollande.

There's also ""An Imaginary Racism"" by the left-leaning philosopher Pascal Bruckner, who was recently cleared of charges of inciting hate speech and argues that fear of being labeled Islamophobic is leading people to self-censor their speech, while in November, the Sciences Po professor Gilles Kepel published ""The Fracture,"" which explores how the radicalization of some young Muslims is tearing apart French society. ""The thing that's very striking now is how pervasive those ideas are,"" said Sudhir Hazareesingh, a professor at Oxford University and the author of ""How the French Think."" ""One of the things characteristic of the present moment is this idea that decline and decadence are not just the preserve of the extreme right."" France's preoccupation with decline has been dated by some scholars to the counter-Enlightenment of the early 19th century, and to the late 1970s and the end of three decades of postwar economic growth by others. Today, different ""declinist"" strains have merged, from Catholic reactionaries to nonreligious thinkers preoccupied by questions of national identity and political corruption.

With France's presidential elections looming in April, these often abstract ideas are taking more concrete form as the hard-right National Front and the center-right Republican Party capitalize on sentiments of decline exacerbated by economic malaise and terrorist attacks. Mr. Onfray's ""Decadence"" begins with early Christian history, traverses the French Revolution, then sweeps in the Holocaust, the fall of the Berlin Wall and the 1989 fatwa against Salman Rushdie, which Mr. Onfray says prefigured the 2015 attacks at the French satirical journal Charlie Hebdo. Though he looks beyond France in his diagnosis, his homeland is central for much of its nearly 600 pages.

Mr. Baverez, a lawyer and economist whose ""Chronicles of French Decline"" came out this week and whose ""France in Free Fall"" was a hit in 2003, said he didn't believe in the idea of declinism. ""It's a false concept because it gives the impression that decline is something fated,"" said Mr. Baverez, who has consulted with Francois Fillon, the center-right presidential candidate now caught up in a worsening corruption scandal. ""We have to diagnose denial; we have to accept reality to find solutions."" Even in a country like France, where pleasure is held sacred, decline does seem to be better business than optimism. ""To put it in Manichaean terms: Anything positive doesn't sell, and anything negative sells, as if there were a sort of masochism on the part of some readers,"" said the historian Robert Frank, the author of the 2014 book ""The Fear of Decline: France from 1914 to 2014."" ""The French Suicide,"" by the conservative journalist Eric Zemmour, has sold 510,000 copies since it appeared in 2014; it argues that immigration and feminism have contributed to French decline. The philosopher Alain Finkielkraut's ""The Unhappy Identity,"" about French multiculturalism and its discontents, started a national conversation in 2013, while ""The Time Has Come to Tell What I Have Seen,"" a 2015 political memoir by the politician and writer Philippe de Villiers that's heavy on concern about decay, has been a best seller. The right-wing magazine Valeurs Actuelles, which publishes frequent warnings about the decline of France and the threat of Islamic terrorism, saw its combined print and digital circulation rise to 119,000 copies last year from 86,000 in 2011, according to figures provided by the magazine. The decline boom seems to manifest itself in books and intellectual debate more than in popular culture, although some French television shows have waded into the murky waters. Recent seasons of ""Engrenages,"" or ""Spiral,"" a dark police drama, paint a bleak picture.

Not everyone is so pessimistic. ""Yes, the French speak about 'declinisme' and are fascinated by decadence, but the most popular political figure in France today is the only one that speaks of hope,"" said the political scientist Dominique Moisi, author of ""The Geopolitics of Emotion: How Cultures of Fear, Humiliation, and Hope Are Reshaping the World."" He was referring to Emmanuel Macron, the former economy minister in the current Socialist government who founded his own insurgent party and has been gaining momentum. Even if declinism is going strong, France's birthrate is still among the highest in Europe, and studies have consistently shown the French to be more pessimistic about their country than about their own lives. Some hope the decline industry has peaked. ""I think Trump and Brexit were a kind of electric shock, and something changed,"" said Cecile Daumas, the editor of the Ideas section of the French left-wing daily Liberation. She pointed to ""A World History of France,"" by the medieval historian Patrick Boucheron, which seeks to put French history in a broader context and argues that the country has absorbed immigrants for centuries. The challenge is that ""the partisans of decline have formed a vocabulary, a way of speaking that's accessible to the broader public,"" Ms. Daumas said. ""The progressive intellectuals of the left lost their public and are trying to get it back,"" she added. ""It's a real battle.""","Books, TV shows and other media are digging into the country's preoccupation with its failings and tapping into an anxious mood as elections approach.",9f5664c6-5fef-517a-a8b4-dcd79bf7e34b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/04/arts/04PARISDECLINEJP/04PARISDECLINEJP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c782c9b71050c93a1fc33ffbb51acf8f9aca0792ebfa613ce9a16670a95eda1b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michel Onfray is one of the latest popular authors to join France's decline industry.

Health,Blood Pressure Medicine Is Recalled,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/health/fda-blood-pressure-valsartan.html,"The Food and Drug Administration has announced a voluntary recall of a widely prescribed blood pressure medication made in China, reviving fears about the safety of imported drugs.

Three companies that sell the generic drug, valsartan, in the United States agreed to recall it after the F.D.A. said it might be tainted by N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), considered a probable human carcinogen. The agency is still investigating, but said the contamination was believed to be related to changes in the way that valsartan was manufactured.

All of the valsartan that is being recalled was made in China by the same company, Zhejiang Huahai Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. It is distributed in the United States by three companies: Major Pharmaceuticals; Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd.; and Solco Healthcare. Solco, which is owned by Huahai Pharmaceutical, had about 45 percent of the market in 2017, according to John Brito, of Fore Pharma, the market research firm.

""We have carefully assessed the valsartan-containing medications sold in the United States, and we've found that the valsartan sold by these specific companies does not meet our safety standards,"" said Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Style,Pete Hamill 'Ain't Done Yet',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/style/pete-hamill-brooklyn-book.html,"Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York Times





Mr. Hamill was a star city columnist when such a thing was still possible. His gritty yet soaring dispatches about cops, immigrants and crooked City Hall cronies earned him a reputation as a tabloid poet, long before the word ""tabloid"" was synonymous with celebrity fluff. Even so, he never let the tabloids contain him. Mr. Hamill wrote acclaimed novels and mingled with movie stars. He interviewed legends of the 20th century like Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Che Guevara, and palled around with Robert F. Kennedy. All of that makes Mr. Hamill a living archetype of a dying breed, the celebrity newspaperman -- famous enough that in 1977, Jimmy Breslin, his friend and fellow columnist at The New York Daily News, outed him for dating Jackie Onassis. Mr. Hamill rolls his eyes at such talk. He has no time for Hollywood, or legacy. Three years ago, he moved back to his native Brooklyn with his wife, Fukiko Aoki, and is now locked in a battle with his aging body to finish his 22nd and, he said, possibly last book, ""Back to the Old Country,"" a reminiscence about the borough that shaped him.

There may be another reason for his look back. In 2014, Mr. Hamill, then 79 and living in a TriBeCa loft, was feeling profoundly weak and tired, and was rushed to a hospital, where doctors discovered that he was in the first stages of kidney failure. On his third day in the hospital, he was in cardiac arrest. Doctors also found mysterious fractures of his pelvis and spine. Heavily medicated, he slipped into a medical coma, and remained there for nine days. Doctors told his wife he would never emerge. In fact, he emerged in unusual fashion. ""When I came out of it, I started talking in Spanish,"" Mr. Hamill said. (He lived in Mexico as a young man, studying art on the G.I. Bill.) He also emerged with a mission: to return to Brooklyn after nearly 30 years. The place he landed sits some 20 blocks from the tenement where Mr. Hamill grew up in what is now known as South Slope. With its period moldings and overflowing bookcases, the parlor duplex is more cozy than opulent -- a home for a writer, or rather, two. (Ms. Aoki, whom he married in 1987, is a former bureau chief for Newsweek Japan and the author of 15 books.)

The book he spends his days writing is not a memoir, precisely. He's already done one of those. ""A Drinking Life,"" from 1994, recounted his childhood of stickball and street fights as the eldest of seven children of Catholic parents from Belfast, Northern Ireland; his rise from Brooklyn Eagle delivery boy to newspaper columnist; and his boozy nights at old writers' bars like the Lion's Head in Greenwich Village, which led to a messy breakup with alcohol. He quit cold turkey on New Year's Eve, 1972. ""I didn't want to be an Irish stereotype,"" he said. His current book is a rumination on the Brooklyn of his youth: Prospect Park, Coney Island, Sunset Park and ""explaining the notion of home,"" he said. It is ""trying to make sense of a life"" now that he has moved into ""a period of extra innings."" ""It's just looking and inhaling and remembering, which is, as you get older, harder because you don't remember the new,"" he said, seated in a white sofa in his living room, which was filled with family photos and music CDs. ""I can remember things from 1943, and sometimes not remember what the hell I had for breakfast.""

If memory sometimes fails him, maybe it is because there is too much to remember. Legacy has been a major issue in Mr. Hamill's life of late, especially after the recent HBO documentary, ""Breslin and Hamill: Deadline Artists,"" which profiled Mr. Hamill and Jimmy Breslin -- two Irish outer-borough guys who became kings of the city, back when New Yorkers still announced who they were by the newspapers they read. The film is a celebration of an era both very recent and very lost, when the overflowing ashtray was as much a part of the newsroom landscape as the Royal manual typewriter, and Mr. Hamill and Mr. Breslin helped define the stories that defined New York. The two were friends, but opposites. Mr. Breslin was grandstanding, pugnacious, in love with the very idea of Jimmy Breslin. Mr. Hamill -- big-hearted, self-effacing, in love with the rhythms of the city and the poetry he found there. Even his moral outrage carried a hint of lyricism. In 1989, when Donald Trump took out full-page ads in city newspapers calling for New York State to adopt the death penalty following the arrest of the Central Park Five, the African-American and Latino teenagers accused -- wrongfully, it turned out -- the raping of Trisha Meili, the so-called Central Park Jogger, Mr. Hamill fired back: ""Snarling and heartless and fraudulently tough, insisting on the virtues of stupidity, it was the epitome of blind negation,"" he wrote in Esquire. ""Hate was just another luxury."" In his columns, Mr. Hamill mastered an almost haiku-like brevity. ""Tabloid stories are highlight films,"" he said. But he also knew how to spread his wings. As a magazine writer for Esquire and New York Magazine, he rode the wave of New Journalism alongside Gay Talese, Gloria Steinem and Tom Wolfe (all of whom share recollections in ""Deadline Artists"").

Mr. Hamill's 1969 article, ""The Revolt of the White Lower Middle Class,"" could have been written in 2016: ""The working-class white man is actually in revolt against taxes, joyless work, the double standards and short memories of professional politicians, hypocrisy and what he considers the debasement of the American dream."" ""Any politician who leaves that white man out of the political equation,"" he added, ""does so at very large risk."" Mr. Hamill's writing was so New York that you could almost hear the subway rattling behind every sentence. But he never let the city constrict him. He filed dispatches from Belfast at the height of the sectarian Troubles, and from the battlefields of Vietnam. His intimate interview in Rolling Stone with John Lennon in 1975 has entered into Beatles lore, although the two got off to a rocky start. ""I hated him,"" Mr. Hamill said. The trouble started when Mr. Hamill found himself seated with the members of the Beatles and the Rolling Stones at a large table at a London club called the Ad Lib. The two almost came to blows when Lennon suggested that Yanks were not welcome. ""Why don't you just get the hell out of here,"" Lennon said.

As Mr. Hamill recounted in the 1980 New York Magazine article, ""The Death and Life of John Lennon"":""He stared at me, and I stared back. The Irish of Liverpool challenging the Irish of Brooklyn. The music pounded, and then, as if he had seen something that he recognized, he smiled and broke the stare and peered into the bottom of his glass."" Robert F. Kennedy was more than a subject. He was a friend, despite the fact that Kennedy, the scion, and Hamill, the tenement son, represented opposite ends of the Irish-American experience. Kennedy used to tag along with Mr. Hamill to blue-collar bars in Brooklyn to talk to constituents. And Mr. Hamill was only feet away when the senator was mortally wounded at the Ambassador Hotel in 1968. ""I could see him blinking,"" Mr. Hamill said. ""He didn't utter a word."" It would not be his last encounter with the Kennedy clan. A decade later, he found himself dating one of the most famous women in the world, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

But it is a topic that Mr. Hamill is loathe to discuss. ""I really agree with Garcia Marquez, who said once, that everybody's got three lives: public life, private life and a secret life,"" Mr. Hamill said in the HBO film. ""Private life is by invitation only. Secret life is nobody's business."" To him, the focus on his boldface paramours damaged the film. ""They spent more time on Jackie Onassis and Shirley MacLaine than on my wife, and I've had my wife for 35 years,"" he said. ""I don't want her feelings hurt by stupidity from 40 years ago."" Maybe that's an old-fashioned view. It wouldn't be his only one. Mr. Hamill is of a generation that believes that a man could learn to be a man by reading Hemingway. Last year, he published a new introduction to his 1998 book, ""Why Sinatra Matters."" Even so, he resists the idea of being an octogenarian wallowing in nostalgia, even if he did return to Kings County to write a book about lost Brooklyn. He is maybe halfway finished. Progress can be slow. ""It's hard to do legwork with two broken hips,"" he said with a weary smile. Legwork that day consisted of a brief house tour, with Mr. Hamill guiding his walker to get him through the kitchen to show off the large, and largely unfinished, yard in back. ""The house was built in the 1870s, and you can see what this must have been,"" he said, surveying the backyards of the neighboring brownstones, which aside from a lack of clotheslines, looked much like they did in the days before the internet, or even television.

""See that tree there, the big, thick one a couple yards back,"" he said, pointing toward a towering oak tree. ""Imagine when that was a kid here, 100 years ago."" If he squints, the new, cosmopolitan Brooklyn of Michelin-starred restaurants and glassy condominiums is not so different from the wartime Brooklyn he knew as a child. ""Until a helicopter comes over, flying to the Hamptons,"" he said. Those are observations he will mine for the book. Some days, he is able to put in a full day writing. On dialysis days, he comes home drained. ""I have to eat lunch -- vitamin L -- and take a nap before I begin to feel I'm able to do work. When I do, it's late in the day."" The news of the day brings its own form of distraction. ""Every day, it's another stupidity or tragedy,"" he said. ""To call Washington D.C. a moral pigsty would be an insult to pigs."" At least he can avoid the time suck of social media that plagues younger journalists. His last tweet was sent in 2015. ""I don't do Twitter,"" he said. ""I don't do LinkedIn. I don't have enough time."" ""And time,"" he said, ""is the most urgent four letter word when you're my age.""","The last of the celebrity newspapermen, Mr. Hamill moved back to Brooklyn to write a final book.",da018f27-63d2-5b01-a48b-c83bd0eed32c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/26/fashion/26hamill-promo/26hamill-promo-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=db262ed5deab495839af2abeb367dabdd42c9e67a598634e61f3f2dc5a304188&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The journalist and author Pete Hamill in the living room of his Brooklyn apartment.,da018f27-63d2-5b01-a48b-c83bd0eed32c,N24News/imgs/da018f27-63d2-5b01-a48b-c83bd0eed32c.jpg,15
Technology,"Pushed by Pandemic, Amazon Goes on a Hiring Spree Without Equal",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/27/technology/pushed-by-pandemic-amazon-goes-on-a-hiring-spree-without-equal.html,"SEATTLE -- Amazon has embarked on an extraordinary hiring binge this year, vacuuming up an average of 1,400 new workers a day and solidifying its power as online shopping becomes more entrenched in the coronavirus pandemic. The hiring has taken place at Amazon's headquarters in Seattle, at its hundreds of warehouses in rural communities and suburbs, and in countries such as India and Italy. Amazon added 427,300 employees between January and October, pushing its work force to more than 1.2 million people globally, up more than 50 percent from a year ago. Its number of workers now approaches the entire population of Dallas. The spree has accelerated since the onset of the pandemic, which has turbocharged Amazon's business and made it a winner of the crisis. Starting in July, the company brought on about 350,000 employees, or 2,800 a day. Most have been warehouse workers, but Amazon has also hired software engineers and hardware specialists to power enterprises such as cloud computing, streaming entertainment and devices, which have boomed in the pandemic.

Other retailers -- both with physical stores and online ones -- competed with Amazon on Black Friday and were strategizing on how to make the most of the busy end-of-year sales period, which has been upended by the pandemic. Many encouraged curbside pickup and put social distancing measures in place on Friday, but they saw light foot traffic. Amazon has the largest share of e-commerce, where sales are expected to grow by as much as 30 percent over last year's holiday season, according to the National Retail Federation. Amazon's rapid employee growth is unrivaled in the history of corporate America. It far outstrips the 230,000 employees that Walmart, the largest private employer with more than 2.2 million workers, added in a single year two decades ago. The closest comparisons are the hiring that entire industries carried out in wartime, such as shipbuilding during the early years of World War II or home building after soldiers returned, economists and corporate historians said.

Even for a company that regularly sets new superlatives, Amazon's employee growth stands out as a stark illustration of its might. At this pace, it is on track to surpass Walmart within two years to become the world's largest private employer. Its expansion is unfolding as lawmakers and regulators in Washington and Europe have sounded the alarm over tech power. This month, European Union regulators brought antitrust charges against Amazon, accusing it of unfairly using its size and access to data to harm smaller merchants in its marketplace. Amazon has said merchants are thriving on its site, with their share of sales growing in the pandemic. The Federal Trade Commission is also examining the company, with President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. expected to continue scrutinizing the tech giants. ""We are turning into Amazon nation,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a history professor at the University of Washington and a contributing New York Times opinion writer. Having employees in nearly every state gives Amazon, which has warehouses around the country to be closer to customers, potentially outsize political leverage, Ms. O'Mara said. She added that history has shown there are risks when a region or country becomes too dependent on any one employer, though she said Amazon had not reached that point. Amazon has portrayed its hiring as a boon for workers laid low by the pandemic-induced recession, as unemployment has soared and as restaurants, airlines and other businesses suffer.

Some government policies have helped Amazon's recent growth. In March, a taxpayer-funded $2 trillion stimulus package allowed local governments to shut down traditional retail stores to reduce the spread of the virus. As the stores closed, demand for items through Amazon rose -- and it hired. Adding so many new workers so fast in a pandemic has been a herculean task. Many workers feared catching the coronavirus in warehouses, so Amazon rolled out a fleet of safety measures to address Covid-19. And it revved up its hiring machine, which relies on technology and traditional recruitment. That includes promoting its training, benefits and pay. Of its 810,000 workers who are in the United States, about 85 percent are frontline employees in warehouses and operations who earn a minimum of $15 an hour. That is higher than traditional retail work, where an average sales worker makes $13.19 an hour, but lower than typical warehousing jobs. On Thursday, Amazon said it would pay bonuses of $300 for full-time employees and $150 for part-time employees. To get the word out, Amazon used staffing agencies and advertised on television, billboards and in mailboxes by highlighting sign-on bonuses of up to $3,000 and its precautions against Covid-19. In one recent TV spot, an Amazon employee wearing a mask said, ""Safety, safety, safety!"" In many places, the hiring has come easily because Amazon is one of the few employers with open jobs. In the week leading up to Sept. 16, which the company billed as ""Career Day,"" it said it received more than 384,000 job applications in the United States and Canada, or 38 a minute.

Amazon is not the only beneficiary of how the pandemic has pushed people toward buying online instead of in stores. Walmart has added 180,000 employees in the United States since March, and its online sales rose 79 percent in the latest quarter. Target's e-commerce sales similarly soared 155 percent. In that sense, this downturn has differed from past recessions, when usually all industries slowed, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at Indeed, the online jobs site. ""This period has been partly about a recession but also about a pretty dramatic shift of economic activity from some sectors to others,"" he said. Just two years ago, Amazon's work force numbered fewer than 650,000 people. At the time, the company hit the brakes on hiring to focus more on profits. The hiring pace picked back up a year ago, after it introduced one-day shipping in the United States, an enormous effort that required more warehouses and more workers to pick, pack and sort packages. When the coronavirus hit the United States in March, online shopping condensed years of expansion into a few months. From April to June, Amazon said, it sold 57 percent more items than a year earlier. That spurred its first pandemic hiring wave of about 175,000 temporary workers. Many were hired to replace employees who had taken advantage of an unlimited unpaid time off policy at the outset of the pandemic. To attract new employees, Amazon offered workers an extra $2 an hour and increased overtime pay. It said the extra wages were not ""hazard pay,"" but incentives.

""Some of that growth has clearly been planned,"" she said. ""I think that the head count ramp, though, has really been fueled by customer demand."" Over the summer, Amazon converted most of the 175,000 temporary workers to permanent employees and ended the extra pay bumps for all workers. Since then, it has continued with waves of hiring. The company has also almost tripled the number of U.S. warehouses used for last-mile deliveries this year, said Marc Wulfraat, founder of the logistics consulting firm MWPVL International, who tracks Amazon's operations. The delivery drivers are usually contractors, so Amazon does not disclose their numbers in regulatory filings. ""They have built their own UPS in the last several years,"" Mr. Wulfraat said. ""This pace of change has never been seen before."" Ms. Williams said Amazon also built relationships with companies that were reducing staff, such as Uber, American Airlines and Marriott, to promote its hiring. ""We dedicated a group that did nothing but connect with organizations who were furloughing people, whether it was temporary or permanent,"" she said. ""That allowed us to take a skilled, quality work force, and very quickly and easily move them into opportunities that were appropriate at Amazon."" The effort has been aided by 1,000 technology workers who create software for Amazon's human resources teams, many building portals and algorithms that automate hiring, she said. Prospective employees can find jobs, apply and be hired entirely online, without talking to a single person.","The company has added 427,300 employees in 10 months, bringing its global work force to more than 1.2 million.",cf20f2b2-ee3b-5574-b678-3441251023cd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/28/business/00amazon2/00amazon2-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Amazon employees at a delivery station in Arzano, just outside Naples, Italy.

Books,What Book Does Ruth Ware Call 'Truly Terrifying'?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/books/review/inside-the-list-faq.html,"""There was something sick in that house ... if you scratched the walls of Heatherbrae house, scoring the handblocked peacock wallpaper with your nails, or gouging the polished granite tiles ... darkness would seep out.""

That's a creepy passage from Ruth Ware's evocatively titled novel, ""The Turn of the Key,"" which enters the list at No. 3. It's a murder mystery set at a meticulously restored Victorian manor house in the Scottish Highlands, where the smart technology has a mind of its own: Lights turn on, doors close and music blares, often in the dead of night. ""Whether Heatherbrae is haunted or not (and you'll have to make up your own mind on that), I love a good haunted house story,"" Ware writes on her website, going on to list five favorites: Susan Hill's ""The Woman in Black,"" Stephen King's ""The Shining,"" Daphne du Maurier's ""Rebecca,"" Sarah Waters's ""The Little Stranger"" and Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" which she calls ""truly terrifying.""

She isn't the only one: Numerous writers have cited it as the scariest book they've ever read, including Neil Gaiman, who told The Times last year, ""A maleficent house, real human protagonists, everything half-seen or happening in the dark. ... It scared me as a teenager and it haunts me still."" In ""Danse Macabre,"" his book on the horror genre, Stephen King said ""Hill House"" was one of ""the only two great novels of the supernatural in the last hundred years"" (the other was ""The Turn of the Screw"").

Travel,36 Hours in Boise (and Beyond),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/09/travel/what-to-do-in-boise.html,"Boise -- derived from the French word for wooded, but a name that also reflects a confluence of frontier myth and speculation -- sits below the Rocky Mountains on a verdant plain known as Treasure Valley. Boise (BOY-see, if you're a local; BOY-zee if you're not), once a gritty stop along the Oregon Trail, is Idaho's capital and, with a population of 223,000, its most populous city. It is a place that offers frontier charm, easy access to expansive wilderness, a reverence for modern art and creative restaurants (not to mention goats known for their landscaping skills). It is also a place where visitors will find Basque culture -- the most concentrated in the country -- throughout the city, especially in the Basque Block neighborhood. The culture is an integral part of Boise, where children can take Basque dance lessons and adults can drink calimotxo, a red-wine-and-Coke libation.

Get sweeping views of downtown Boise and learn something about falconry, when you venture into the lowlands, a 20-minute drive outside the city. There, on a plateau that more than a half dozen falcons and other birds of prey call home, the World Center for Birds of Prey (also the headquarters of the Peregrine Fund) offers live raptor presentations and one of the world's most thorough falconry archives. There are displays on raptor diets and migration patterns, and an astonishingly in-depth exhibition that details how Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the former president of the United Arab Emirates, devoted much of his life to preserving the culture of falconry. General admission is $10.

A festival each summer commemorates Basque immigrants who settled throughout the rural areas in the 19th century, where they were miners and later shepherds. Evidence of the Basque diaspora is everywhere: a large mural of children playing pelota (similar to handball) overlooks downtown's Basque Block, where utility boxes display images related to Basque dance, paella, bocadillos and tapas at the Basque Market, and an artzainak (Basque for shepherd) exhibition at the Basque Museum. Cocktails at The Modern Hotel and Bar downtown offers Basque-inspired cocktails such as the Barbarella (Hacienda de Chihuahua sotol, Bozal Tobasiche mezcal, rhubarb shrub and fresh ginger, $10). After a drink, explore the nearby Julia Davis Rose Garden, which holds more than 2,000 rose bushes inside a 43-acre park.

Helmed by the chef Christian Phernetton, State and Lemp sources Pacific Northwest and Idaho meats, cheeses and vegetables. The prix fixe menu, about $200 for two, changes frequently. On a recent visit, the menu included smoked sturgeon, octopus and fiddleheads, pork with rhubarb and a creme fraiche panna cotta. The venue is essentially an intimate art gallery with kinetic sculptures and other local artwork for sale. Reserve in advance. If French cuisine is more in line with your tastes, Le Coq d'Or, in nearby Eagle (part of the metropolitan sprawl surrounding Boise), offers a menu that includes a tempura avocado crab boat (Dungeness crab with mango, cilantro and habanero ginger aioli, $14) and free-range chicken with ""truffle spinach"" and goat cheese risotto ($31).

Heed the call to an amazing breakfast at Wildroot Cafe and Market, tucked behind an unassuming facade and decorated with bright green furniture. You can delve into a plate of Wagyu steak and eggs (served with sweet potato hash and asparagus, $16) or migas (a queso fresco and green onion omelette-like dish, with chorizo, house-made avocado salsa verde, pinto beans and crispy tortillas, $10). For a taste of Basque cuisine, go to Txikiteo (Basque for pub crawl), which opened in March. For breakfast, indulge in the Gateau Basque (a fluffy cake topped with a cherry, $5) and the jamon serrano and manchego breakfast sandwich ($7). Less than an hour's drive from downtown is the city of Horseshoe Bend and the fantastical woodlands that surround it. Some of the best river rafting anywhere may be had on the Payette River ($60 for half-day trips). Or hike along the Wildlife Canyon Scenic Byway and spy on mountain goats and elk at various overlooks. Idaho Mountain Touring offers mountain bicycle rentals ($15 to $60 for up to four-hour rentals, depending on bike model); check out the Bogus Basin, a year-round skiing and biking enclave with verdant trails once used for gold mining.

Rent a car to drive through the Sawtooth Mountain range (a roughly three-hour picturesque drive) for an overnight in the Sun Valley wilderness. Central Idaho is the only certified dark sky preserve in the country -- designated in 2017, it is one of 12 worldwide. (Though the designation applies to 1,416 square miles of craggy backcountry, anywhere outside of downtown Boise will do.) Set up your base camp in the town of Ketchum (try The Tamarack Lodge, where rooms start at $125), the final resting place of Hemingway. You'll find his grave in the Ketchum cemetery. It's the one adorned with pens and bottles of whiskey. Recover from your drive with a flight of local craft beer specials, a house-baked pretzel ( made with duck fat, rosemary and saison beer cheese, $8) and the butcher's cut steak (market prices vary) at Warfield. Then explore the Sawtooths by kayak (Backwoods Mountain Sports, daytrips from $30, depending on model) or join a Salmon River float fishing trip (White Otter Outdoor Adventures, $350 a person). You'll wend past gold-mining ghost towns and hot springs while navigating the same rich waters that the fur trader Alexander Ross and the Hudson's Bay Company did in the 19th century. Have a drink at Michel's Christiania in Ketchum, where Hemingway spent his last night with his wife, Mary, and where you can enjoy the carpaccio de boeuf ($14) and escargots bourguignon ($15). Or save your appetite and go to the Town Square Tavern where you will find something like a Fifth Avenue vibe served alongside lamb burgers ($12), duck confit tacos ($13) and tapas ($6 to $12). Order a slice of Turkish coffee mud pie ($6) and then, as you head home, bask in the brightness of a blanket of stars.

No trip to Idaho is complete without potatoes. Frites come as sides with most everything. But there is only one Ice Cream Potato. Back in downtown Boise, enter Westside Drive-In, a throwback complete with pink neon sign. O.K., the ice cream isn't actually made with potatoes. Rather it is frozen ice-cream compressed into the shape of a russet potato then rolled in cocoa powder and slit down the middle. Filled with rich whipped cream, it's the perfect alt-snack in a place famed for its spuds. When in the Gem State, do as the miners did: Head for the hills and the gold, which may or may not be there. Either way, appreciate the abundance of natural resources at the Idaho Museum of Mining & Geology (free), and then stroll through the Old Idaho Penitentiary ($6) next door, which offers a good introduction to Western prison history . There are several trailheads nearby, so hike into the rolling desert landscape, a vestige of what frontier remains. Once a ramshackle motel, the Modern Hotel and Bar (1314 West Grove Street, themodernhotel.com; queen rooms start at around $130) is now a chic boutique inn with reasonable rates and excellent cocktails. Built into the foothills overlooking the north of the city, the delightful Boise Hillside Suites (4480 North Kitsap Way, boisehillsidesuites.com; from $85) is roughly five minutes from downtown, and features landscaping stones from the Boise City Hall. Looking for camp and kitsch? The Anniversary Inn (1575 South Lusk Place, anniversaryinn.com; from $159) has been a stalwart in Boise for years and is part of a larger Midwestern chain, with rooms such as the Treasure Island suite, the Sleeping Beauty's suite and a Swiss Family Robinson-style treehouse.","Once a hardscrabble stop on the Oregon Trail, Idaho's capital combines remnants of frontier charm with an appreciation of fine food, local history and Basque culture. And beyond its urban borders, nature beckons.",7324f400-1069-5ee0-b2db-eb3d5a349ede,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/travel/19Hours-Boise6/19Hours-Boise6-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cfa3a10105d651e5b6c28b95f7fa5de4e30bc97b6b57855eb11effba534b7449&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Bikers enjoy the Boise River Greenbelt.,7324f400-1069-5ee0-b2db-eb3d5a349ede,N24News/imgs/7324f400-1069-5ee0-b2db-eb3d5a349ede.jpg,4
Your Money,"Deducting Your Home Office, Made Simpler This Year",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/13/your-money/taxes/deducting-your-home-office-made-simpler-this-year.html,"If you work at a home-based business, you may want to consider a new, simpler option for taking a deduction for your home office on your federal income tax return this year. The Internal Revenue Service announced last year a streamlined option for the home office deduction, effective for the 2014 filing season. The agency said the new ""common sense"" alternative aims to reduce paperwork and record-keeping hassles for those who claim the home office deduction. Approximately 3.3 million taxpayers claimed nearly $10 billion with the deduction in the tax year 2011, the I.R.S. said. The new ""simplified"" option involves multiplying the square footage of your home office -- up to 300 square feet -- by a fixed amount of $5 to determine your deduction, which is capped at $1,500.

To claim the optional deduction, you can complete a short work sheet found in the tax instructions and enter the result on your tax return. (If you're self-employed, you claim it on Schedule C, Line 30; if you're employed for someone else, but use a home office, you claim it on Schedule A, Line 21.) Previously, the only way to claim the deduction required filling out Form 8829, a 43-line document. That option -- which the I.R.S. calls the ""regular,"" or standard method -- can involve complex calculations of allocated expenses and depreciation, and carry-overs of unused deductions. That approach, the agency said, can be ""burdensome"" for small-business owners, because they have to keep all sorts of records, like mortgage and utility statements, to calculate their deduction. If you use the new option, you can't depreciate the portion of your home used for business. But you can claim allowable mortgage interest, real estate taxes and insurance losses on your home as itemized deductions on Schedule A. These deductions don't have to be allocated between personal and business use, as the regular method requires. As with taxes in general, however, things can be tricky even if they appear simple at first. The new method may be a particularly good option if you're less than diligent about keeping expense records for use of your home office, said Jessi Dolmage, a spokeswoman for TaxACT, a provider of online tax preparation software. If you do keep detailed expense records, though, you might be better off using the standard method. To be sure, you have to calculate the deduction using both methods. So much for fewer hassles. Using the regular approach may yield a larger deduction, said Ms. Dolmage, particularly if your office is small.

To get a quick idea of whether the simplified option makes sense, you can multiply your home office's square footage by $5, and compare the result with your deduction on last year's tax return. If the result is more or about the same, you can go with the simpler form. But if it's less, you may want to take the time to calculate your actual expenses. ""If historically you've taken a larger deduction, you might be better off with the old-fashioned method,"" said Mark Luscombe, principal federal tax analyst for CCH, a tax information provider. Here are some additional questions about the home office deduction: # Does the simplified option make it easier for my work space to qualify as a home office for tax purposes? No. The simplified option doesn't change the criteria for a home office; it just reduces the calculations and record-keeping requirements associated with taking a deduction for its expenses. To qualify, you still must use the space regularly and ""exclusively"" as your principal place of business, according to Mr. Luscombe of CCH. (That means your home office can't double as, say, your child's playroom.) If you work as an employee of a business, rather than being self-employed, your home office must be for the convenience of your employer in order to qualify. # If I moved last year and used home offices in different houses, can I use the simplified option? Yes -- but for just one of the homes. The deduction for the other home must be calculated using actual expenses, according to the I.R.S. # Where can I find more details about using the simplified option? See I.R.S. Publication 587, Business Use of Your Home, available online. Or or visit the I.R.S. website for some frequently asked questions about the new option.","A new, streamlined option for the home office deduction is available this filing season, and the I.R.S. hopes it will reduce paperwork hassles.",c985b15b-4ea2-5128-94ba-1a4b486fb80a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/14/business/adviser/adviser-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=373&w=600&s=03c22669b0fab6810fd89427c81390fed9a4ad153a444869b65a7f1aa57997ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Kelly Schindele works from her home office in East Wenatchee, Wash., where she writes captions for television.",c985b15b-4ea2-5128-94ba-1a4b486fb80a,N24News/imgs/c985b15b-4ea2-5128-94ba-1a4b486fb80a.jpg,21
Theater,It's 'Opening Night' for Two Shows That Pay Homage to Cassavetes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/theater/its-opening-night-for-two-shows-that-pay-homage-to-cassavetes.html,"John Cassavetes's ""Opening Night"" ha s long been catnip to theater fans. It's easy to see why: The 1977 film is about an aging, hard-drinking actress, portrayed by Gena Rowlands, who becomes increasingly unhinged during a play's out-of-town tryout. Cassavetes shot a lot of it in front of a live audience in Pasadena, Calif., and the result constantly threads the line between fantasy and reality, performance and life. Coincidentally, New Yorkers will be able to see two different theatrical works drawing from ""Opening Night"" this fall. And they are radically different from each other: The Australian import ""The Second Woman"" has a cast of 101 -- one woman and 100 men -- and runs 24 hours; a French ""Opening Night"" features three actors and lasts 75 minutes. (The original film has a large ensemble and goes on for two and a half hours.) ""This is an experiment: don't expect the movie or you'll be disappointed,"" the Parisian director Cyril Teste said of his ""Opening Night"" -- a warning that applies to both of the new shows. In comparison, Ivo van Hove's adaptation of ""Opening Night,"" seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in 2008, feels downright conventional in retrospect, despite his reputation as an iconoclast.

Ms. Adjani is exactly the kind of outsize performer suited to the flamboyant role of Myrtle Gordon, a leading lady haunted by a young fan who was hit by a car after trying to talk to Myrtle. And the role spoke to the French actress. ""I found personal echoes with her journey, her emotions, her relations with the director and the other actors, her self-investigation,"" Ms. Adjani said in an email. ""Why do I do this job? What's the point? Do I trust myself enough?"" But Mr. Teste did not want a star vehicle. He tried to evoke not so much Cassavetes's film as the director's process. His ""Opening Night,"" which he described in a FaceTime interview from France as a ""filmic performance,"" mixes live video and actors, and a degree of uncertainty was baked into the production. Back in February, Mr. Teste, 44, scrapped everything after the dress rehearsal and had his cast basically rehearse a new version live during the show's premiere, in Belgium. Since then, each evening has been slightly different from the previous one. ""Everything that changes on that stage, including my part, is fine with me because that's how you stay alert,"" Ms. Adjani said. ""My pledge as an actress is to never settle down.""

This approach is not far from Cassavetes's own modus operandi: He often re-edited and sometimes even reshot his films, most notoriously ""Shadows."" ""Doing the film isn't interesting -- I hope what we do is a tribute to Cassavetes via his working methods,"" Mr. Teste said. ""The process is the show."" Despite its high-tech trappings, his production is very much actor-centered, as was Cassavetes's work. ""John's writing is all about characterization, to let actors perform in ways that they seldom get a chance to,"" said Al Ruban, 86, a longtime Cassavetes associate who was the producer and cinematographer on ""Opening Night"" and is in charge of licensing rights to the filmmaker's oeuvre. ""When we shot the movies, it was really the characters driving each one of these productions. I think [stage] directors see that and see opportunities for them and for actors."" ""Opening Night"" deals with the complicated professional and personal relationships among writers, directors and performers, but also between men and women -- which may explain why the film, in which Myrtle has fraught relationships with the men around her, is an object of scrutiny right now. That was one of the aspects that drew the young Australian theatermakers Anna Breckon and Nat Randall, both of whom wrote and directed ""The Second Woman."" Their show borrows its title from the play within the film but uses fewer than 10 lines from the original.

Speaking by Skype from Adelaide, Australia, where she and Ms. Randall were developing a new project, Ms. Breckon, 35, described the one scene as ""two people negotiating a relation that has become toxic but are sufficiently attached to each other not to leave. The idea is that small emotional interactions say something about the way men and women treat each other in a particular cultural context."" Ideally the men are nonactors, sourced from ""spaces and communities that don't necessarily have a strong relationship with the theater,"" as Ms. Randall, 33, put it. Their not being used to the stage helps spark variations and physical improvisation that evoke the often unpredictable energy of the Cassavetes piece , she said. The length adds an extra layer of potential tension. ""It's rough, it's very hard to do because that element of surprise is really intense when you're also quite fatigued and something radical comes in or something more aggressive or more sexual,"" Ms. Randall said. (She created the part, but in Brooklyn there will be a new actress, whose name has not been announced yet.) Ms. Breckon and Ms. Randall often talked about their production in abstract terms, with references to the Meisner acting technique and theories of the male gaze. Audience members unfamiliar with academic research should not fret, though: ""The piece is quite funny,"" Ms. Randall said, laughing. ""It's light and entertaining!""","An Australian production features the same scene repeated 100 times, while a French version stars Isabelle Adjani in the Gena Rowlands role.",96052b66-12ad-52b5-813c-62c296022033,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/arts/8new-openingnights1/15new-openingnights1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3527079e9aeecc7dc25f0ca55bf3b11c85e00557677082069d63f96aaa420c98&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Isabelle Adjani in Cyril Teste&rsquo;s adaptation of &ldquo;Opening Night&rdquo;; Nat Randall, a co-creator of &ldquo;Second Woman&rdquo;; and Gena Rowlands.",96052b66-12ad-52b5-813c-62c296022033,N24News/imgs/96052b66-12ad-52b5-813c-62c296022033.jpg,10
Technology,This Deal Helped Turn Google Into an Ad Powerhouse. Is That a Problem?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/technology/google-doubleclick-antitrust-ads.html,"A billboard that promoted a part of Manhattan -- and the ad technology company DoubleClick -- during the dot-com boom 20 years ago.





This Deal Helped Turn Google Into an Ad Powerhouse. Is That a Problem?

Google owns the world's leading search engine, it operates the largest video-hosting service in YouTube, and its popular web browser, email, map and meeting software is used by billions of people. But its financial heft -- the source of nearly all its enormous profits -- is advertising. And perhaps no day was more pivotal in transforming Google into a powerhouse across the entire digital advertising industry than April 13, 2007, when the company clinched a deal to buy DoubleClick for $3.1 billion. The deal turned out to be ""a total game changer, a crucial piece in the larger jigsaw puzzle Google put together,"" said Timothy Armstrong, a former Google executive who championed the acquisition. It has also turned out to be a classic example of why a growing number of antitrust experts say lawmakers need to broadly rethink how mergers are regulated when the buyer is a tech company with strong and growing market power.

The Justice Department is expected to file an antitrust suit against Google by the end of the month. The case is expected to concentrate on how Google uses its dominant search engine to harm rivals and consumers. An investigation by attorneys general from dozens of states, led by Texas, into Google's ad business may result in a separate suit. But the Justice Department wants to move quickly, and that meant leaving out the ad allegations. Its decision points to the challenge facing antitrust enforcement in a fast-moving, highly complex tech business: Investigations are difficult, long and backward looking. Instead, those experts say, the country needs a more pre-emptive approach, making it much more difficult for big tech corporations to buy other companies -- and perhaps forcing spinoffs if a past acquisition took out a nascent competitor or became a short cut to greater market power. In other words, changing the law so that Google would not have been able to buy DoubleClick.

The Federal Trade Commission, which reviews many mergers, approved the DoubleClick deal in a 4-to-1 vote. William Kovacic cast one of the four assenting votes. ""If I knew in 2007 what I know now, I would have voted to challenge the DoubleClick acquisition,"" said Mr. Kovacic, now a law professor at George Washington University who is among the experts pushing for stronger merger oversight. In Senate testimony last week, Donald Harrison, Google's president of global partnerships and corporate development, described the DoubleClick deal and smaller ones in digital advertising as ""finding a piece of technology"" that the company then invested in and strengthened to accelerate innovation. Online ad prices, Mr. Harrison said, have fallen over the past decade, and it is a highly competitive marketplace. DoubleClick had a valuable asset: its business relationships and ad-serving technology used by thousands of publishers online. In 2007, Google was a tenth of the size it is today. Still, it was a surging company and a heavyweight in search and in search advertising, with $16.6 billion in revenue. And it was headed for the business where DoubleClick made its living -- larger display ads on websites and video ads. Google, for example, was giving away software tools that DoubleClick had charged for. To diversify, DoubleClick created an ad exchange, or marketplace, as a new business and a buffering source of revenue.

The auction for the company came down to three finalists, Yahoo, Microsoft and Google, said David Rosenblatt, a former chief executive of DoubleClick. The three bids were similar in value, he said, but Google, given its thriving search business, had access to the largest pool of advertisers, complementing DoubleClick's strength with publishers. ""The combination with Google made the most sense,"" Mr. Rosenblatt said. The Federal Trade Commission gave Google the go-ahead to buy DoubleClick by December 2007, as did the European Commission a few months later. Looking back, Mr. Kovacic said a legal challenge to the deal would have been ""difficult but not impossible."" Another former commissioner said a merger review was a prediction of whether competition may or may not result. But he added that it was an educated guess, made by regulators grounded in the present. No one foresaw the power that tech platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon would amass, said the former commissioner, who asked not to be identified because of potential conflicts with clients of his firm. In its 2007 statement allowing the DoubleClick deal, the commission described broad swaths of the digital ad market as ""relatively nascent, dynamic and highly fragmented,"" adding that other big companies ""appear to be well positioned to compete vigorously against Google."" Microsoft, it seemed, could be a formidable rival. Just a month after Google announced the DoubleClick deal, Microsoft agreed to pay about twice as much -- more than $6 billion -- to acquire aQuantive, another digital ad company.

At the time, aQuantive mainly appealed to Microsoft as a competitor to Google that could slow its expansion plans in advertising. Microsoft saw Google as its most dangerous rival because it posed a threat to Microsoft's lifeblood products, Windows and Office, former executives say. Google was offering free versions of email, document and spreadsheet programs over the internet, subsidized by advertising. ""With DoubleClick, Google was playing offense, but aQuantive was a defensive move for Microsoft,"" said Brian McAndrews, the former chief executive of aQuantive. (Mr. McAndrews is a member of The New York Times's board of directors.) For Microsoft, aQuantive was never really a priority, former executives say, and its leaders departed and it withered. In 2012, Microsoft publicly conceded that the deal had failed, taking a $6 billion write-off. While DoubleClick was its largest deal by far, Google built up its ad technology business with a string of acquisitions. It bought start-ups that made software for publishers, advertisers and mobile ads, including AdMob in 2009, Invite Media in 2010 and AdMeld in 2011. Those building blocks and its in-house innovations have given Google a strong presence in every step of buying and selling online ads. ""Google has put it all together,"" said Jeffrey Rayport, an online marketing expert at the Harvard Business School. ""Google is the market under one roof."" Google's one-stop shop is a huge convenience for the smaller businesses that generate much of the tech giant's revenue and do not have online advertising expertise. But the Google machine can seem like a fortress to ad tech companies seeking a slice of the market.

The problem lasted a few weeks, a temporary blow to the start-up. The message Mr. O'Kelley and his team took from the episode was that operating a business in the Google ad ecosystem could be precarious and unpredictable. Over the next several years, AppNexus struggled at times, but it persevered and emerged as an alternative to the Google marketplace. In 2018, AT&T bought AppNexus for $1.6 billion. AT&T executives spoke of the company as a linchpin in AT&T's vision of creating a television and digital video advertising exchange that would be a counterweight to Google and Facebook. But those ambitions were scaled back, and the focus became using AppNexus to provide the best ad tech for AT&T's Time Warner television and video units, including CNN, TBS and TNT. This month, The Wall Street Journal reported that AT&T was looking to sell its digital ad unit. Things might look different today if the Federal Trade Commission had made a different decision in 2007, said Mr. O'Kelley, who left AT&T in early 2019. ""Had DoubleClick not gone to Google,"" he said, ""it's not clear that Google would have been the power it became -- certainly not as easily.""","The $3.1 billion acquisition of DoubleClick in 2007 was a ""game changer.""

Dance,Suzanne Farrell and Kyra Nichols Carry On Balanchine's Spirit,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/03/arts/dance/suzanne-farrell-and-kyra-nichols-carry-on-balanchines-spirit.html,"WASHINGTON -- Since the death of the choreographer George Balanchine (1904-83), his legacy has both receded and grown. The last of Balanchine's own dancers have retired. Certain aspects of Balanchine technique have lost their gleaming edge (as he himself often predicted). Yet there's been a vast posthumous Balanchine surge. I've seen more than 60 of his ballets in the last 10 years; Balanchine Without Balanchine is a growth industry. Both trends were evident in recent days, when two of his last ballerinas -- Suzanne Farrell and Kyra Nichols -- staged his works. Both dancers were in their prime when he died; many of us remember them sharing the stage in several Balanchine ballets, taking the complex facets of his work -- classical, Romantic, modernist -- to new peaks. At the Kennedy Center in Washington this past weekend, the experienced Ms. Farrell added new repertory (the Faure ""Emeralds"" and the Gounod ""Walpurgisnacht Ballet"") to her company's already extensive Balanchine store; her Suzanne Farrell Ballet also revived the divertissement pas de deux from Act II of his Mendelssohn ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" in this engagement. And the week before, Ms. Nichols -- a novice at staging Balanchine -- produced the Bach ""Concerto Barocco"" for the Pennsylvania Ballet, a company with a long Balanchine history, at the Philadelphia Academy of Music. What these and other stagings teach us is that there's no one definitive Balanchine style any more. You find different facets of it in different cities around America, even abroad.

Within the first few seconds of the Pennsylvania Ballet ""Concerto Barocco,"" the eight women of the corps exemplified many of the virtues of Ms. Nichols's own dancing: singing lines, long phrases, springing rhythmic brio, easy spaciousness. This was marvelous to see, and it continued into the brightness of the pairs of lead women. This ""Barocco"" nonetheless scaled no heights. Unnecessarily bright smiles grew more tense as the ballet proceeded; the lead ballerinas seemed guarded. The Pennsylvania company, now in its second season under Angel Corella's direction, is in transition, and it may be moving away from the Balanchine style that was its bedrock. In the spring, Ms. Nichols will be staging Balanchine's ""Serenade,"" a ballet even more central to her career than ""Barocco."" That will reveal more. The Suzanne Farrell Ballet -- its repertory is always largely, sometimes solely, Balanchine -- is not a year-round institution, but it has given annual seasons at the Kennedy Center since 2001. These have shown how Ms. Farrell's comprehension of Balanchine extends far beyond the roles she danced herself. This program ended with ""Emeralds,"" the first of his three ""Jewels"" ballets (1967). Though she always danced the last, ""Diamonds"" (which she has staged at the Kennedy Center in the past), her company delivered ""Emeralds"" with real nuance, sensitivity and freshness. You could feel the many layers of Balanchine's musicality: rhythmic play, harmonic tension, complex phrasing. In the role created for Violette Verdy, Heather Ogden (first cast) danced with something of the communicative eloquence associated with the ballerina who inspired it, and in the second part, made for Mimi Paul, Natalia Magnicaballi's beauty and quiet demeanor found a worthy vehicle. Better yet were Valerie Tellmann and Allynne Noelle in the second cast. Ms. Tellman did not dance with unbroken confidence, but -- wonderfully partnered by Kirk Henning -- she had moments of incisive grandeur and sweep, while Ms. Noelle, a company debutante, cast a consistent spell -- delicate and sure at the same time. (In the first cast she also brought particular sparkle to the pas de trois.) Another welcome company newcomer is the tall, long-limbed, handsome Thomas Garrett, who partnered Ms. Ogden.

Most members of the Farrell troupe show a relaxed grasp of basic Balanchine style. Several marvelous features were notable: With many dancers, you could see how movement continued through the arms, even when they were holding fixed positions. And I'd send most of today's City Ballet dancers to study the way the Farrell performers use their eyes -- seldom seeming fixed on a classroom mirror but instead opening up the distances of the auditorium. Few of Ms. Farrell's dancers, however, have full Balanchine virtuosity. This became an issue in the program's opening ""Walpurgisnacht Ballet,"" a work in which Balanchine ballerina technique reaches its most exuberantly rococo: Some steps come in huge flourishes, others in tight knots. The central role has had three superlative interpreters at City Ballet: Ms. Farrell herself, Ms. Nichols, and, today, Sara Mearns. Although, at the Kennedy Center, Violeta Angelova (excellent in less full-throttle roles) and Ms. Magnicaballi both delivered it with light charm, they lacked the strength to bring it either heroic swagger or coloratura force: without which it's hard to see why Ms. Farrell wanted to present this piece. The exquisite, gossamer-like divertissement pas de deux was well served by two casts. Again, Ms. Noelle -- quietly rapt -- enchanted. Still, New Yorkers know that this is another dance that has recently regained peak form at City Ballet, notably with Tiler Peck. In Washington, Ms. Farrell followed this with the cute and gushy sensationalism of the Scene d'Amour from Maurice Bejart's ""Romeo and Juliet"" (to Berlioz music), the sole non-Balanchine offering on this year's quadruple bill. Ms. Magnicaballi and Michael Cook and, in another cast, Ms. Angelova and Mr. Henning, danced it eagerly, as if released; the Washington audience gave both the program's warmest ovation. Few dancers in my lifetime have been as inspiring as Ms. Nichols and Ms. Farrell. Many of today's dancers still recall Ms. Nichols's performances (she retired in 2007); many who were born after Ms. Farrell retired in 1989 now watch videos of her dancing with awe. Yet neither is currently working in ideal circumstances. Even though Balanchine's domain has been enlarged far and wide, these performances remind us that the possibility of recession is always present.","There is a surge of interest in his ballets, which have the power to endure, but do not survive unchanged.",083167f1-cd4b-51c9-b4f8-b530760115f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/03/arts/03FARRELL/03FARRELL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=c5d440c9d2ac4a839076cb001fc8add677f8f1ed87242fc91b75531b7edc3a6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Heather Ogden and Thomas Garrett in ""Emeralds,"" a ballet by George Balanchine.",083167f1-cd4b-51c9-b4f8-b530760115f5,N24News/imgs/083167f1-cd4b-51c9-b4f8-b530760115f5.jpg,6

When Corey Patterson heard about the terrorist attacks in Brussels last week, he had a clear-cut response to people who asked if he was going to cancel a coming trip to Belgium. ""That's exactly what the terrorists want, so absolutely not,"" Mr. Patterson, 45, said on Twitter. He's in the Netherlands now, visiting a former roommate and his family, and will head to Belgium in a few days. ""Anything can happen anywhere at any time,"" Mr. Patterson, a Texas resident, said through messages on Twitter. ""You can't stop living life, and this world is worth seeing, so I chose to do it."" ""Americans especially seem to be fairly resilient and do not panic and cancel trips, unless perhaps they are traveling in the next few days,"" Jennifer Michels Jones, vice president of communications for the American Society of Travel Agents, said in an email.

After the attacks in Paris last fall, 64 percent of the association's agents found that their clients did not plan to delay or cancel travel to and from or within Europe. The travel alerts issued by the State Department also fall far short of advising people to cancel their plans. ""We're not saying, 'Don't travel,' especially not to Europe, but we are saying, 'Be careful if you do,'"" said Michelle Bernier-Toth, the managing director of the federal Office of Overseas Citizens Services. Here are seven ways to take care when traveling to Europe, or really, anywhere. Enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program gives the government the ability to send email alerts to a traveler about potential problems, like demonstrations. ""And it gives us a general idea of how many U.S. citizens might be in a country,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said.

2. Know how to contact the American Embassy. Embassy information is available on the government's travel website. Use the search box to pull up information about an individual country. The first pull-down menu lists all the embassy information. Heading to Belgium? The number: 32-2- 811-4000. ""Knowing how to get ahold of us is important,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. ""In the event of a major event, we will work as quickly as possible to identify people who need our assistance and do what we can to help."" 3. Find out how to contact local authorities in case of an emergency. On the page opened in Step 2, each country's equivalent to ""911"" is listed, as well. Britain's equivalent is 999. In France, it's 112. In Belgium, it's 101 if it requires the police, or 112 for everything else. This information is under the ""Safety and Security"" pull-down menu, though not usually at the top. 4. Those phone numbers are only useful for working phones. Your phone plan may not work abroad. Most carriers offer international plans, and they may be expensive. There are alternatives, like renting a phone or buying a SIM card locally. ""It's very useful to have an international SIM card,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. Phones may have to be unlocked, which you can ask your carrier to do. But if something does happen, the number of people trying to make phone calls around the same time can overwhelm phone lines. ""But often text messages will go through,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. Social media sites, like Facebook, and free messaging services, like WhatsApp or WeChat, are alternatives, too. 5. Be vigilant when in public places and using mass transit. ""I don't think you can avoid using mass transit, but be smart about that,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. ""Know the exit strategy."" The same applies to major tourist attractions, sporting events, restaurants and other crowded areas.","American tourists seem unfazed by recent terror attacks, but travel experts do suggest some basic precautions.",dfcf9f9a-3459-5c48-8ea5-ebd7fb70187d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/travel/31xp-travelsafe/31xp-travelsafe-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=cc89d9fa87f45597be589a06d96e9f84dd9633fb2793be6a6e5ddc0848ccb36d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Travelers at Kennedy International Airport in March.

Art & Design,"From Afar, a Fugitive in the Knoedler Art Fraud Gives His Defense",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/arts/design/knoedler-art-jose-carlos-bergantios-diaz.html,"Until now, little has been heard from Jose Carlos Bergantinos Diaz, whom the authorities charged in connection with the sale of $80 million in phony works.

From Afar, a Fugitive in the Knoedler Art Fraud Gives His Defense

He was accused of having been a central figure in one of the largest art world scandals of recent times, but little has been heard from Jose Carlos Bergantinos Diaz, who the authorities say helped orchestrate the sale of $80 million in phony works. Now in his first in-depth interview, Mr. Bergantinos Diaz, a fugitive living in Spain, has acknowledged to a documentary filmmaker that he discovered Pei-Shen Qian, the painter from Queens whose ability to mimic the work of Modernist masters fooled much of the art world. But he denied assigning him that task or of being involved in the scheme to sell dozens of the counterfeit paintings, made by Mr. Qian in his Queens garage, as the work of artists like Mark Rothko and Jackson Pollock.

""I was never ambitious; Glafira was the ambitious one,"" Mr. Bergantinos Diaz, 64, told the filmmaker Barry Avrich, whose documentary, ""Made You Look,"" just aired on Canadian TV. ""She loved fancy clothes and fancy parties."" Ms. Rosales, 63, who pleaded guilty to nine counts of conspiracy, fraud and other crimes in 2013, told the authorities that Mr. Bergantinos Diaz used threats and abuse to coerce her into continuing with the scheme. They arrested and charged him with wire fraud and money laundering as well as conspiring to defraud the Internal Revenue Service and other crimes in 2014, but have been unable to extradite him from Spain. As the film depicts, the scandal rocked the art world, called into question the ability of experts to determine what works are authentic and led to Knoedler's closure after 165 years in business.

Speaking from Spain, Mr. Bergantinos Diaz said he had made a mistake in trusting Ms. Rosales and that she had lied when she accused him of mistreating her. ""I forgive her and she is the mother of my daughter and I wish her the best,"" he told the filmmaker. Mr. Avrich, who said he has plans for a limited theatrical release of the documentary in New York and Britain in the fall, said he interviewed Mr. Bergantinos Diaz in Lugo, the art dealer's hometown in the northwest part of the country. Mr. Bergantinos Diaz told the filmmaker that he met Ms. Rosales in Mexico and they moved to New York where, impressed by the high prices that art could fetch, they established a gallery in Chelsea. At one point, he describes placing colleagues in an auction room to help bid up the price of a work he was selling. But it was Ms. Rosales, he said, who had ambitions to be a big player in the art world.

Among the most astonishing elements of the scheme was that the painter, Mr. Qian, was able to master the styles of a diverse array of famous painters to the point that acknowledged experts and sophisticated collectors did not notice they were frauds. The federal authorities said it was Mr. Bergantinos Diaz who recruited Mr. Qian to produce the scores of paintings and drawings that were presented as newly discovered works by major artists. They said in court papers that he treated the canvases to make them look old and that some of the proceeds from the sales were wired to bank accounts in Spain controlled by him. In his conversation with the filmmakers, Mr. Bergantinos Diaz described how he met Mr. Qian at the Art Students League, an arts school in New York. ""We knew from the school that he was very talented at doing copies of famous artists,"" he told the filmmakers. Mr. Bergantinos Diaz bought some of his works. While he insisted Ms. Rosales had the most contact with Mr. Qian, he said that sometimes they made suggestions together about what he should paint. He said Ms. Rosales's work with the Knoedler Gallery was independent of him, that he never met its director, Ann Freedman, and that he was not aware that Ms. Rosales was selling work made by Mr. Qian as the real thing. ""I didn't know everything she was selling or buying because we were distanced from each other and I have my own networks,"" he said, speaking sometimes through a translator.","Until now, little has been heard from José Carlos Bergantiños Diaz, whom the authorities charged in connection with the sale of $80 million in phony works.",a57408f4-d726-52fc-a419-30188b7d6589,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/25/arts/23knoedler1/23knoedler1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=529&w=1011&s=a9a6c52dfad4889ebe7fe9be7d2291250a800717d66f8db22dd97fc79acc1b9e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jos&eacute; Carlos Berganti&ntilde;os Diaz in Spain in 2017.,a57408f4-d726-52fc-a419-30188b7d6589,N24News/imgs/a57408f4-d726-52fc-a419-30188b7d6589.jpg,14
Media,Apple Steps Into the Movie Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/business/media/apple-movie-theaters.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Apple is going to the movies.

The company, which is set to unveil its Apple Plus TV streaming service on Nov. 1, will enter the film business this fall with theatrical releases of three movies it acquired this year, Apple said on Friday.

The effort will expand in 2020, when Apple plans to start producing its own films, some of which are being made in conjunction with the independent movie studio A24, the producer behind ""Moonlight"" and ""Lady Bird,"" two people with knowledge of the company's plans said. Apple and A24 agreed last year to make movies together.

The first movie that Apple has lined up for theatrical release is ""Elephant Queen,"" a documentary centered on a 50-year-old elephant. It will open in theaters in ""select cities"" on Oct. 18, the company said, before appearing on Apple TV Plus on the streaming platform's start date. The film, which the Toronto International Film Festival screened this month, is narrated by the actor Chiwetel Ejiofor.

The next offering will be ""Hala,"" a coming-of-age drama about a Muslim teenager played by Geraldine Viswanathan, who had a role in the 2018 comedy ""Blockers."" It will make its debut in what the company described as ""select theaters"" on Nov. 22 and go onto the streaming service in December.

Automobiles,A Kit With Few Instructions Inspires an Improv Act,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/04/automobiles/collectibles/Auto-Ego-Kit-With-Few-Instructions-Inspires-an-Improv-Act.html,"LIKE many homes in the Rego Park section of Queens, the one owned by Steven Kaplan and his wife, Dalia, is made of red brick and has a short driveway that slopes down from the street to a small garage below. On weekends when the roads are dry -- and not only when the air is warm -- Mr. Kaplan, a 67-year-old social worker, will walk down to his garage, where he parks a rather antique-looking car. The peculiar two-seat roadster has two wheels up front and only one in back. Officially, this three-wheeler is classified as a motorcycle, so Mr. Kaplan will squeeze his head into a carbon-fiber motorcycle helmet. He will put on his sunglasses and step into the car, following a carefully orchestrated maneuver. He will fire up the engine -- mounted between the front wheels and fully exposed, therefore very loud -- and go for a drive around the big Tudor Revival homes in nearby Forest Hills Gardens. ""You're going to think you're in Europe, especially by the train station,"" he said in a voice that evoked Robert Duvall.

""It's a superluxurious area,"" he said of the neighborhood during a recent drive. ""Since I don't have their kind of money, at least I have something that I can show off."" Mr. Kaplan, assistant director of B'Above Worldwide Institute, a Head Start agency in Queens, has always been fond of small cars. He once owned a 1934 Austin 7 convertible, a spindly mass-market creation from Britain. Among his memories of growing up in Brookline, Mass., after World War II, he said, was seeing Messerschmitts, then one of the more popular three-wheel cars, on the road.

""Really different,"" he emphasized. ""Anyone could buy an old car that was manufactured in huge numbers."" The car he wanted was a three-wheel vehicle made by Morgan, a British automaker, starting a century ago and lasting into the 1950s. But a vintage car of that pedigree was beyond his means. (Morgan recently introduced a modern version of the car that sells for more than $40,000.) So Mr. Kaplan researched replica cars, making two trips to England in 2000-1. He eventually found one he liked, a CX3 model made by B.R.A., and had it shipped to Queens. It arrived in an immense wooden crate in July 2002. It was a kit car. The crate contained a frame, made of square steel tubing, fiberglass and aluminum panels, the seats and the wheels (but not the tires, because of federal regulations). The engine, which came from a Honda CX 650 motorcycle, was bought separately. Its V-twin design is similar to what Morgans use. ""But it wasn't like putting Tab A into Slot B,"" he said. ""No such kit."" The assembly manual provided more of an outline than step-by-step instructions, and the hand-drawn illustrations were very basic. The last car Mr. Kaplan built, when he was a young boy, was a scale model. So before the crate of parts arrived, he hung two fluorescent fixtures on the ceiling of the garage and installed a pegboard on one wall, hanging it full of tools. Then he spent the next six years building the car. It required some improvisation. He had to shape the body panels, bending the aluminum sheets into a hood and trunk by hand. Brackets had to be made for the radiator, exhaust pipes and rear suspension. The fuel system, including a fuel pump, regulator and a five-gallon tank, had to be pieced together.

""And about a year I spent trying to figure out a reverse gear,"" he said, explaining that most motorcycles don't have a mechanism for backing up. ""The reverse was something that I wanted to do, and I could've bought a reverse gearbox that goes in line with the driveshaft,"" said Mr. Kaplan, who also owns a Chevrolet and a scooter. ""It was over $1,000. So I thought, 'I'll do it myself.' After spending more than a year and probably more than $1,000 on unbelievably bad designs -- none of them worked -- I gave up."" To park the car in his garage, he turns it around by hand in the street before rolling it down the driveway. ""It only weighs 900 pounds,"" he said. ""And to push 900 pounds on wheels is not a big deal."" Fortunately, other attempts at custom modification were much more successful. He had coolant pipes plated. He replaced the folding Brooklands windscreen that came in the kit with a full-width V-screen that he said looked more like the original Morgan. He made special brackets for the seat belts. He upholstered the seats and added an electric speedometer. ""I put an air horn in because I want people to notice me,"" he said. He used the wood dashboard included in the kit as a template for a custom-cut metal dashboard, which he sent to California to have a jewel pattern milled onto its face.","Steven Kaplan's B.R.A. CX3 kit car, a replica Morgan three-wheeler, didn't come easy. But after a six-year building effort, he now rides through his Queens neighborhood in style.",ea8d13e5-732f-5c49-a65b-3d2accd38921,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/04/automobiles/04EGO1/04EGO1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=09eaa9b49437f6ae1281eef3889d9ab64c10e6d02cac16e50d20a418f09749a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"HOBBY: Steven Kaplan built his Morgan three-wheeler in his Queens garage, a project that took six years.",ea8d13e5-732f-5c49-a65b-3d2accd38921,N24News/imgs/ea8d13e5-732f-5c49-a65b-3d2accd38921.jpg,23

A Family History in White Supremacy

 By Edward Ball When his mother died in 2003, the writer Edward Ball went to New Orleans, where her family had lived for generations, to bury her and sort through her belongings. Among her papers were documents that had been collected by her late aunt, including tales about the man who was known in the family as ""our Klansman."" Ball had already written, in 1998, a deeply reported National Book Award-winning history, ""Slaves in the Family,"" for which he tracked down descendants of those who had once been enslaved by his South Carolina ancestors on his father's side. In his new book, ""Life of a Klansman,"" he follows a similar course, taking the reader along with him on a journey of discovery as he teases out facts, engages in speculation and shares his emotions about the sad saga of Constant Lecorgne, an unsuccessful carpenter and embittered racist who was a great-great-grandfather on his mother's side. The result is a haunting tapestry of interwoven stories that inform us not just about our past but about the resentment-bred demons that are all too present in our society today. ""This is a family story,"" he writes. ""Yet it is not a family story wrapped in sugar, the way some people like to serve them."" The family is not just his, it's our nation's. [ Read an excerpt from ""Life of a Klansman."" ] Lecorgne, born in 1832, was raised in a New Orleans that was, as it has been throughout its history, very complex racially and ethnically. About a quarter of the population were French-speaking whites, a quarter were English-speaking whites, a quarter were free mixed-race Creoles and a quarter were slaves. The Lecorgnes were in the first category, but they rented a home from a free French-speaking woman of color.

Because he has few documents, Ball indulges in a lot of surmises and speculations, perhaps a bit too many for my taste. He pictures the young boy Lecorgne walking with his family the four blocks to Congo Square, where the slaves were allowed to drum and dance on Sunday afternoons. There is a sexual tension that the boy finds both attractive and appalling. ""I think I can begin to see, in Congo Square, a script and a stage, a place where Blackness and whiteness meet,"" Ball writes. ""Complications ensue. They move apart. Eventually the script calls for a crescendo. Blackness and whiteness collide, and the ending, for our Klansman, is an explosion."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

Lecorgne is the unsuccessful and unpopular middle child of a large family. He tries to make a living as a carpenter, but he descends into what is known in the local parlance as petits blancs, the poor working-class whites. Resentments accrue. When he marries, his wife's family gives him a household slave as a dowry, but he has to sell her for $500 to afford a home. The Civil War offers Lecorgne an outlet for his resentments and a chance to finally earn a little respect from his family and neighbors. But even there he fails. After joining one of Louisiana's militias as a captain, he is demoted to a second lieutenant. On a train trip to Virginia he gets into a melee and, along with much of his unit, is court-martialed. At a public ceremony, he and his comrades have one-half of their scalps shaved and are cashiered. Lecorgne heads back to New Orleans in disgrace.

Under Reconstruction, the city becomes integrated. Blacks can vote, testify against whites in court and sit where they want on the streetcars; a few even attend integrated schools. Lecorgne's neighborhood in uptown New Orleans, around where Napoleon Avenue meets the river (which is where I grew up), becomes mixed, with Creoles, Germans, Irish, Blacks and mulattoes all living on the same blocks. It's nice to think what the city, and our nation, might have been had that progression continued. But among the whites, especially the petits blancs, resentments built.

The clubhouses for resentful poor whites are the neighborhood firehouses. Lecorgne joined one just off Napoleon Avenue, the Home Hook & Ladder Company, housed in a Romanesque building with a first-floor facade clad in stone and a second in red brick. Its membership suddenly swelled during Reconstruction to 85 men, far more than were necessary to fight off the neighborhood's house fires. Instead, as Ball writes, ""the firehouses play a big part in the tale of the Ku-klux,"" which is what the loose-knit confederation of white supremacist organizations came to be called. Lecorgne was a minor player in this movement. But for that reason his tale is valuable, both for understanding his times and for understanding our own; he allows us a glimpse of who becomes one of the mass of followers of racist movements, and why. His one recorded inglorious moment came in early 1873. With Black support, a Republican was elected governor, and the local white militias took up arms to resist his rule. Lecorgne and a group of armed men gathered with the goal of taking over their neighborhood police precinct station, hoping it would spark a wider white uprising. Although the newspapers referred to them as ""Ku-Kluxers,"" the rebel raiders most likely did not wear robes and hoods. That practice was mainly for rural marauders. They were successful, but the following night the police staged a counterattack. As Lecorgne hid in a staircase, his cousin was wounded and a friend was killed. Lecorgne surrendered and was carried away to the city jail. In the indictment, which misspelled his name, he is accused of treason and violating federal law for having ""unlawfully maliciously and traitorously conspired"" to attack state authorities. But a local judge quickly dismissed all the charges. That low point was the high point of his life. Near the end of his book, Ball makes a fascinating digression. It involves a prominent person of color who lived in New Orleans at the same time as Lecorgne. Louis Charles Roudanez was a medical doctor, trained in France and at Dartmouth, who published The New Orleans Tribune, a daily newspaper for the Black community. An homme de couleur libre, Roudanez married a free woman of color. While researching his own family, Ball decided to look for the descendants of the Roudanez family. He finds one of the physician-publisher's great-great-grandchildren, named Mark Roudane, living in a leafy subdivision of St. Paul, Minn. ""He was raised white, and he appears white,"" Ball writes of Roudane. ""In middle age he learned that according to the one-drop rule of blackness, he was not white."" Roudane did not know the tale of his father's ancestors, or even the Roudanez spelling of his family name, until he stumbled across some family documents when he was 55. As happened with Ball, the discovery of a bit of family history leads Roudane on a quest. ""When my father died, in 2005, I was going through his papers and throwing stuff away, and I found an unmarked binder,"" Roudane tells Ball. It contained papers showing how his father, who was designated as ""colored"" on his birth certificate, had forsaken his distinguished roots, changed the spelling of his name as a young man, gone to Tulane by passing as white and then moved to the Midwest. Despite this history, or perhaps because of it, he became a resentful white racist. ""When it came to talking about Black people,"" Mark Roudane told Ball, ""all this venom would come out. I thought, 'Why is my dad being ugly?' I didn't understand it."" The interconnected strands of race and history give Ball's entrancing stories a Faulknerian resonance. In Ball's retelling of his family saga, the sins and stains of the past are still very much with us, not something we can dismiss by blaming them on misguided ancestors who died long ago. ""It is not a distortion to say that Constant's rampage 150 years ago helps, in some impossible-to-measure way, to clear space for the authority and comfort of whites living now -- not just for me and for his 50 or 60 descendants, but for whites in general,"" Ball writes. ""I am an heir to Constant's acts of terror. I do not deny it, and the bitter truth makes me sick at the stomach.""","In his latest book, Edward Ball retraces an ancestor's involvement with the Ku Klux Klan in order to shed light on the country's legacy of white supremacy.",f0a6bdc7-9a07-5892-b151-2345eb26e79a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/06/books/review/04Isaacson/04Isaacson-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=6152736aa9540c87c9e2eb369b5bf0c6970dc51ec20a34add79c217ff62596a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Klansman photographed in 1871.

Books,The Union of the Kushners and the Trumps Seems Like Kismet,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/books/review/american-oligarchs-andrea-bernstein.html,"If Kushner was moved by Gorkov's thoughtful gifts, he did not let on to either Congress or to the Mueller investigators. But Bernstein sees the symbolism. The bag of dirt, she writes, was ""reminiscent of the bags of dirt that Rae Kushner"" -- Kushner's grandmother -- ""and her family had dug from the earth and hidden in the walls of Novogrudok ghetto so the Nazis wouldn't know they had dug a tunnel to safety."" Dramatic enough on its own. But Bernstein sees deeper meaning that she wants us to know is lost on her subjects, the Kushners and the Trumps. ""Had it not been for those bags of dirt,"" she writes, ""Rae would never have made it out of the ghetto, to the forest, to the refugee camp, or to New York, where she had four children, including one named after her brother who had died during the escape. And whose own son, Jared Corey Kushner, was now one of the most powerful people in a new and uncertain world slinking again toward darkness.""

[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of January. See the full list. ]

This passage shows Bernstein at her narrative best: reportorial, pointed and unsparing, while reinforcing her theme that the Trumps and the Kushners are ruthless, cold, power hungry and endlessly ambitious. Her narrative traces the origin of the myths about the two families, how these callous, opportunistic dynasties were finally joined at the hip through the 2009 marriage of Kushner and Ivanka Trump, Trump's older daughter and most-favored child, at Trump's Bedminster, N.J., golf club, and what the present generations were willing to do to relatives, friends and foes -- anyone, really -- to slake their seemingly unquenchable thirsts.

But it is also true that Bernstein has picked a most difficult topic to probe for new insights. So much has been written already about the Trumps and the Kushners -- and not just in the four-plus years since Donald Trump descended the escalator in Trump Tower spewing vitriol and hate -- that to add new material to that grotesque canon is an exceptionally challenging task for any reporter, even one as diligent as Bernstein. While ""American Oligarchs"" is a rich and highly readable compendium, one does not finish it and think, ""I've just been bedazzled and infuriated anew."" Rather, the experience of consuming this book is more along the lines of reading an encyclopedia of many of the hateful things we already know, or think we know, about these two families.

As Bernstein shares in her ""Note on Sources,"" she did not have access to Trump or his family. She did not interview the Kushners, although Charles Kushner, Jared Kushner's father, answered some of her questions through his attorney; Jared Kushner, through the White House, provided some factual information but did not answer her questions. She obviously didn't have Anonymous's access to the White House, or even Michael Wolff's. Fear was yet another obstacle to overcome. Most of the more than 200 people she did interview -- many of them with firsthand knowledge of events, and on good terms with the Trumps and the Kushners -- declined to be identified in any way.

Make no mistake, Bernstein is an intrepid reporter, best known for her work at WNYC, the New York City public radio station, and in particular for her relentless digging about Bridgegate, that notorious only-in-New-Jersey story that probably cost Chris Christie, the former governor, the chance of making a serious run for the Republican nomination that Trump won instead. Of course, as Bernstein also shares, Christie was the United States attorney in New Jersey who famously prosecuted Kushner's father for evading taxes, witness tampering, making illegal campaign contributions and hiring a prostitute to seduce his brother-in-law as part of a family feud. When Charles Kushner pleaded guilty, in 2004, he served 14 months in a federal prison.",A new book considers the merging of real estate dynasties and its lasting impact on American democracy.,83be8516-7c6b-5964-adab-da8b2fe0dd86,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/26/books/review/26Cohan/26Cohan-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c472d99a3a46fb8fbd6e97f3a4319d4c3f21f469ae15611cdf3817bf44af2a56&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,White House senior adviser Jared Kushner speaks as President Donald Trump listens during a Hanukkah reception in the East Room of the White House.,83be8516-7c6b-5964-adab-da8b2fe0dd86,N24News/imgs/83be8516-7c6b-5964-adab-da8b2fe0dd86.jpg,13
Television,Here's What 11 TV Writers Are Bingeing,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/arts/television/what-showrunners-are-watching.html,"Liz Feldman had planned on taking a trip after she finished working on the most recent season of ""Dead to Me,"" in hopes of sparking some creative inspiration. But now, stuck at home during a pandemic, the Emmy-winning TV writer has discovered the next best escape: ""Too Hot to Handle."" Shot on the beaches of Punta Mita, Mexico, and starring a cast of scantily-clad contestants, the Netflix dating show has become Feldman's new obsession. ""I'm sort of just leaning into it,"" she said. ""In the past I was a little bit snobby about reality television."" With the coronavirus shutting down most productions, TV makers are now primarily TV watchers, holed up indoors with time on their hands, indulging in soothing rewatches and adding new discoveries to their queues. (Showrunners: They're just like us!) From period pieces to foreign thrillers, here's what 11 of them are bingeing.

Liz Tigelaar was a writer on ""Nashville"" and ""Casual,"" among other shows, before creating Hulu's high-profile literary adaptation ""Little Fires Everywhere."" In her spare time, she usually likes to dive into sharp single-camera comedies like ""Better Things,"" ""Fleabag"" and ""Catastrophe,"" but those haven't been doing it for her lately. Instead, she's turned to the high drama and deadly stakes of ""Homeland."" ""I'm actually enjoying getting sucked into something that's bigger than what we're going through,"" Tigelaar said. The writers really know how to ""arc out a season,"" she said, and make it ""so twisty-turny and action packed and compelling."" She dreaded the show's final episode, which aired on April 26, and might start again from the beginning now that it's done, she said. Tigelaar worked with the ""Homeland"" showrunner Alex Gansa during her first television job, on the teen soap ""Dawson's Creek.""

Dan Levy created ""Schitt's Creek"" with his father, Eugene, and served as showrunner, star, writer and occasional director for the beloved Canadian comedy, which wrapped its final season in April. During production, he would take mental breaks by plowing through British crime television (""Happy Valley,"" ""Broadchurch,"" ""Sherlock""). Now, he's finding a new kind of breather with the Japanese dating series ""Terrace House."" ""It's a reality show about six young men and women who share a house or an apartment with the intention of coupling up, and it's very slow in a way that's incredibly calming for me,"" Levy said. ""I've gone, I think, 36 episodes into a single season and none of them have even kissed."" Levy warned that the show takes a bit to get going. ""At first you don't really know what's going on -- it's just six people having small talk for an entire episode,"" he said. But the payoff is gratifying. ""There's a warmth and a generosity to the experience of what goes on in that house,"" he said. ""It's been a really nice, safe place knowing that at the end of the night, I can always go back to these people.""

Dahvi Waller's writing resume includes ""Desperate Housewives"" and ""Mad Men,"" as well as ""Mrs. America,"" her new critically acclaimed FX mini-series. ""Mrs. America"" chronicles the real-life battle over the Equal Rights Amendment and the soul of feminism. But when it came time to shelter in place, she preferred the lighter side of television. ""I didn't want anything that was too realistic or dystopian,"" she said. ""I'm definitely looking for an escape."" Waller discovered ""Schitt's Creek"" during quarantine and is glad she did. ""First off, I'm from Canada, so watching a show filmed in Canada is very comforting,"" she said. ""It's also just so funny."" ""You can digest three or four a night,"" she added. ""It's really going to get me through.""

Before the pandemic, whenever she was working and found herself losing comedic steam, she would tune into late-night talk shows to get in the right mind-set. These days, her television consumption has turned into a steady diet of ""lush BBC mini-series adaptations of novels and dark, moody spy dramas."" Meriwether wants entertainment that transports her to another time and place, like ""Little Drummer Girl,"" the AMC mini-series based on the John le Carre novel, and ""Deutschland 83,"" the Sundance thriller about an undercover spy living in 1983 West Germany. ""A good spy drama is always a little bit lonely; the spy lives with a secret that separates him or her from the rest of the world,"" Meriwether said. ""Instead of wanting to watch comedy where I can pretend that everything is happy and fine, I seem to want to watch something that meets me where I am -- a little lonely and sad.""

It's a cliche to call someone ""the hardest working person in show business,"" but if anyone has a legitimate claim on the title, it's Greg Berlanti. The executive producer of more than 20 shows, he also has recent writing credits on shows like ""You,"" ""Titans"" and ""All American"" and is responsible for the CW's sprawling Arrowverse, including the concluded ""Arrow,"" ""The Flash"" and ""DC's Legends of Tomorrow,"" among other series. So it's surprising to discover that there are corners of television where he has never ventured before. Namely: survivalist reality shows. ""My husband and I have watched every season of 'Alone,'"" he said, ""Survivalists get placed somewhere horrible and alone and see how long they can survive off of whatever they can forage.""

As a creator, with Bill Hader, of HBO's ""Barry,"" Alec Berg has spent two seasons weaving comedy from assassinations, sensitive Chechen gangsters and at least one feral young martial artist. But even he was stunned by what he saw in ""Tiger King."" ""What a menagerie of lunatics -- it was kind of awesome,"" he said. ""They're talking about making it a dramatic limited series and I'm sort of like, what do you do to make it more compelling than it already was?"" Berg, who has spent much of his career writing and producing acclaimed sitcoms (""Silicon Valley,"" ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" ""Seinfeld"") also found time to finally finish watching TV's reigning Emmy winner for top comedy, ""Fleabag."" It was the rare show that he found himself bingeing, he said, thanks to its terrific pacing and Phoebe Waller-Bridge's performance. ""As much of a bummer as it is to go to the Emmys and lose every damn year like I do,"" he said, ""to lose to that show didn't bother me at all.""

After two years writing for ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show,"" Liz Feldman made the transition into narrative television, working on ""Two Broke Girls"" and then creating Netflix's dark comedy ""Dead to Me,"" starring Linda Cardellini and Christina Applegate. Perhaps fittingly for the creator of a show about death and loss, Feldman spent the first part of quarantine immersing herself in true crime documentaries. But that didn't last. ""I was looking for content to show me times that were worse than the ones we were in,"" she said. ""Since then, I've taken a little bit of a break from the darkness, and now I've completely devolved into trashy reality television."" She's hooked on ""Too Hot to Handle,"" and despite its ""ridiculous premise,"" as Feldman put it, the show is produced well and has a sense of humor about itself. ""You do see growth from people,"" she said. ""There's that tinge of humanity that makes you feel like maybe it's not the worst thing to watch.""

Tanya Saracho wrote for ""Devious Maids"" and ""How to Get Away With Murder"" before creating the Starz family drama ""Vida,"" which just started its third and final season. When she's writing her show, Saracho makes a conscious effort not to indulge in any television watching. ""I only want to listen to my world and my characters,"" she said. During the pandemic, she's catching up on everything she missed. First up, the British comedy ""Lovesick."" ""I watched all three seasons,"" she said. ""It's just three friends, hapless and feckless."" Next, she dived into ""Feel Good,"" a semi-autobiographical series written and starring Mae Martin. ""It's lovely, even in the dark edges,"" she said, calling ""Martin ""luminous.""","With the coronavirus pandemic shutting down most productions for now, TV makers are now primarily TV viewers.

Music,Think Tim Jones's Cosmic R&B Is Weird? Wait Until You Meet His Dummy,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/arts/music/tim-jones-preacherman-reissue.html,"James Brown was famously known as ""the hardest working man in show business,"" but Tim Jones seems deserving of at least an honorable mention. For over a half-century, this 72-year-old has played R&B music up and down the West Coast while building his own instruments and balancing a succession of daily gigs: fixing typewriters and computers, selling fake furs, driving taxis and limousines. ""They say, 'Don't quit your day job,' and you got that right,"" Jones said over the phone from Oakland, Calif., where he lives in an apartment overlooking Lake Merritt and helps care for his 103-year-old mother. It's time for Jones to update his resume once again: A selection of his synthesizer-driven recordings from the 1980s and '90s -- culled from two obscure CDs he distributed under the name Preacherman -- was released on Friday as ""Universal Philosophy: Preacherman Plays T. J. Hustler's Greatest Hits"" by Luaka Bop. After the October 2017 Companion Records reissue of his 1979 private-press album ""Age of Individualism"" (credited to T. J. Hustler Metaphysical Synthesized Orchestra), Jones is now responsible for two of the strangest records in the past calendar year, if not this millennium.

[Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] On ""Age of Individualism,"" the alien tones of Jones's custom-engineered keyboards surf a similar wavelength as the trippy lo-fi electro-funk once beamed up by cosmic contemporaries like Richard Davis and Starship Commander Wooooo Wooooo (Omer Coleman Jr.). But Jones pushed the weirdness quotient several warp factors further by mixing New Age esotericism with old-school ventriloquism. Both albums feature him delivering self-actualization spiels in a husky come-hither voice, interspersed with Jones's ontological banter with a nearly life-size puppet, outfitted in ""Super Fly"" threads, named T. J. Hustler. The whole act scanned like a Haight Street version of Willie Tyler and Lester, set to dance beats.

""There's nothing more special or unique from the Bay Area, whether it's black music or white music,"" said Will Louviere, a founder of Companion Records. ""There's no other record like it."" Jones started playing organ in bands in the early '60s while growing up around Fresno, Calif., and paid his way through college by gigging with established groups. With a trade school degree in electronics, he got a job at IBM in 1967 fixing typewriters and copy machines, continuing to play at night. Eventually, he led a trio called either Mystic Minds or Mysterious Minds -- the group's 1975 album ""Mind Over Matter"" used both names, and Jones can no longer recall which was correct.

The album's back cover displayed the members clustered around a bizarre contraption Jones had named the Brass Cabinet Orchestra, a modified pipe organ with about 20 horns jutting out of it. The instrument was the first of six or seven musical inventions he fashioned over the years. At the dawn of the electronics era, Jones would buy keyboards, take ""the guts out,"" he said, and reinstall them in a Hammond B3 organ that he dubbed the OMB3, for One Man Band. This coincided with Jones deciding to go solo. ""I got tired of bands because they was running me crazy, so I started doing things by myself,"" Jones said. ""I just made my own original way, the way I thought it should be."" In the late '70s, Jones began producing music at home using what he called the ""one-pass internal mix,"" recording his 10-minute-plus songs directly to tape in a live take, with no overdubbing, mixing or additional tracks. ""Age of Individualism"" comprised two 12-inch records -- one at 33 r.p.m., one at 45 r.p.m. -- that were held together in a binder with yarn. Jones pressed 500 records on vinyl, but only handmade 30 or 40 copies of the distinctive package, which he hawked to local record stores. ""I'd say, 'Put this on consignment and see what people like,'"" Jones said. ""I'd go back and they'd say, 'They ain't heard nothing like this before.'"" After enough rejections, Jones lost interest, and the remaining 450 or so vinyl records likely were tossed along the way. But in 2004, Chris Veltri, the owner of the San Francisco record store Groove Merchant, was crate-digging in the gospel section of a used vinyl shop in Redwood City, Calif., and came across several copies of ""Age of Individualism."" Struck by its oversized heavy cardboard cover (which looks a bit like a linoleum sample), he played the record in the listening station and ""was totally thrown back about how wild it was,"" he said. He purchased most of the copies for $15 each, and played one for his friend Louviere, who was similarly floored and who drove out the next day to pick up the last remaining copy. ""It was just a holding-your-head-in-your-hands moment,"" Louviere said of his first listen to the record. ""It was absolutely amazing.""

Veltri hired a friend to track down Jones, and found him driving a cab in San Francisco. Over the next decade, Veltri and Louviere kept Jones updated on the album's burgeoning cult following -- YouTube posts from Europe, copies trading on Discogs for nearly $2,000 -- before Jones finally agreed to an official reissue. (DJ Shadow, who had been one of the original recipients of Veltri's find, lent his own pristine copy back to Louviere to master the Companion release to vinyl.) ""Thirty years ago they weren't worth a penny!"" Jones said. ""So the pirates really did me a favor."" Jones said that he acquired the nickname Preacherman because of his frequent sermonizing, which espoused self-help nostrums he jokingly terms ""Sun Ra Dianetics,"" first formulated in the era of paperback best-sellers like Erich von Daniken's ""ancient astronaut"" books and Carlos Castaneda's ""Don Juan"" series. ""Everybody was throwing philosophies around right and left back then, about where we came from, where we going, how we got here,"" Jones said. ""I just picked up a lot of the stuff they were saying and incorporated it into my act."" (The Preacherman recordings feature a different keyboard sound, as Jones constantly updated his gear and junked the old hardware, but the lyrical content is nearly identical.) Every straight man needs a comic foil, and Jones found his in T. J. Hustler. Hoping to pump up his live show, Jones heard about a European puppet maker who had relocated to the Castro District of San Francisco and paid him $200 to carve a head out of wood. Jones made the rest of the body himself, and styled the dummy in a pinstriped crimson suit, white silk tie, floppy hat, aviator-frame glasses and cigar. ""You don't see it anymore, but everybody was like that then, diamonds in the back, sunroof top cars,"" Jones said of his street hustler alter ego. A video shot at Channel 25 in San Francisco around 1984 demonstrates the duo's tart repartee. Jones croons away behind the OMB3, then badgers his ""spiritual being"" T. J. into imparting the ancient wisdom that comes from being fashioned out of ""the oldest redwood tree in California."" In response, T. J. decries society for dividing people by skin color and disregarding the environment.","A new reissue shines a light on Jones, known as Preacherman, an obscure musician who has spent four decades fashioning his own instruments and philosophy.",b9faf693-18fa-544f-959e-8c8bc044ace0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/16/arts/16preacherman/16preacherman-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=b70bdd26cac04009553310081abe2c97ea0326aaae03658c13f5870fdca7cfbc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tim Jones, who recorded under names including Preacherman, invented his own instruments and gigged up and down the West Coast while holding down an assortment of day jobs.",b9faf693-18fa-544f-959e-8c8bc044ace0,N24News/imgs/b9faf693-18fa-544f-959e-8c8bc044ace0.jpg,12
Television,"'Big Little Lies' Season 2, Episode 4 Recap: Unhinged",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/arts/television/big-little-lies-episode-4-recap.html,"G ood therapists (does Dr. Reisman still count?) will sometimes tell you that the reason we all fall into patterns, making the same mistakes over and over, is because the pain we've experienced in the past drives us to recreate the situation that caused it -- so we can fix it. The subconscious wants a do over. It's why we ""marry"" our fathers and mothers. It's why we become them, and then realize we're becoming them, and then fight so hard against becoming them. And maybe it's also why Mary Louise is trying to take Max and Josh away from Celeste. Mary Louise is a childless mother. She has buried her two sons: The first, Raymond, was lost long ago in an accident we still know very little about (save for the fact that her husband blamed her for it); and now Perry is gone, too. Apparently stepping in to play Super Grandma hasn't quite been enough to fill the void. But if Mary Louise gets custody of Max and Josh, she gets her do over. Maybe she can do it better this time. Maybe she can fix the past. Which is not to say that Mary Louise has any right to be doing what she's doing. Oh, she deserved that slap she got from Celeste.

But the slap only strengthens Mary Louise's case that Celeste is out of control. She's chronicled the evidence: Celeste's malaise, her stockpile of pills, and most recently, the daze-y, Ambien-induced stare she wears as her one-night stand ambles around the house in front of the kids -- all of it is enough for Mary Louise's attorney to file a petition for custody on the basis that Celeste is, in a word, unhinged. Celeste is in good company, though, considering that's how Chloe describes Madeline in what shall forever be known as the sickest burn in ""Big Little Lies"" history.

If amateurishly smoking a cigarette on her back deck is considered unhinged, then Madeline is certainly that. She doesn't know where she stands with Ed, who still hasn't left but is completely checked out. The only thing that puts any spring in his step, literally, is Bonnie, whom he dances with lightheartedly at Amabella's birthday party -- while simultaneously declining to dance with his wife. This year, Amabella's party is the place to be. The '70s disco vibe brings the funk and the outlandish costumes, as well as a safe haven for every stressed out Monterey family to kick back and comfortably pretend.

Renata and Gordon have turned their house into the Land of Make Believe for this party, the theme of which clearly has nothing to do with Amabella or the kids. (They were good sports, to be fair. Most Gen Z-ers probably don't care about dinosaurs like The Trammps, but maybe D.J. Chloe got them jazzed up with a playlist before the festivities.) Regardless, the whole thing is a show put on by the Kleins, who are fresh from a bankruptcy hearing in which they nearly had to surrender the clothes off their back, as well as reassure the trustee that the house, in which they're throwing this sham party, is on the market. But the pretense is especially wearing on some. Celeste and Bonnie, for example, have about had it with the Trivia Night cover story. Echoing Bonnie in Episode 1 (as well as many commenters here and various ""Big Little Lies"" buffs around the internet), Celeste isn't entirely sure why they lied about Perry's death in the first place. And if she could have her do-over, she wouldn't lie again. This is a fact that Madeline, the ringmaster of the ""let's say he slipped"" circus, takes as a personal affront -- the same way she takes pretty much everything else. In another sense, though, Bonnie is actually doing quite well at pretending. She's smiling more, loosening up. But her mother, Elizabeth, is still around and still making Bonnie generally uneasy. On the dance floor, she takes Bonnie's head into her hands and suddenly slows her sway, closing her eyes, conjuring clairvoyance. Bonnie has seen this trick before and pulls away. ""No,"" she says firmly and walks off. It's not the only dance floor confrontation we see. After Ed shrugs off Nathan's half-hearted attempt to relate to his marital issues, Nathan promptly regresses to the level of the children surrounding him and picks a physical fight with Ed. They've been bro-foes since Episode 1, and we all knew this was coming. But what nobody saw coming was Elizabeth's stroke. As Bonnie's mother collapses to the floor, foaming at the mouth, Bonnie shakes her, screaming, and the whole family ends up at the hospital. If some of us are destined to repeat history, Bonnie's marriage seems something of a mirror image to her parents': free-spirited woman marries straight-laced white dude. And like Nathan, Bonnie's father, Martin Howard (Martin Donovan), obviously doesn't see her clearly, either.

""Did you say something to her?"" Martin asks her accusingly. ""You mean did I cause this?"" she shoots back. Still, dutifully, Bonnie sits all night by her mother's side. Eventually, Elizabeth wakes, and Bonnie tenderly touches her hand to comfort her. Elizabeth's eyes dart around as she grunts in a panic, envisioning Bonnie drowning. And the episode fades to black. So, what are we to make of this prophecy that the show seems dead set on beating into our brains? Since Elizabeth arrived in Monterey, she has been seeing flashes of menacing water. She has even stated her fears outright, telling Bonnie that she sees visions of her drowning. Even Bonnie has tempted the drowning fate, walking deep into the ocean as if toying with a death wish. Would ""Big Little Lies"" ever be this straightforward? Is Bonnie really going to drown? Is someone else going to drown? Is this an allegory? Is this a red herring? What is happening? The show can't possibly be showing us continuous foreshadows of Bonnie drowning only to have her actually drown. In other words, is that a tornado off in the distance? Because I think we're headed for a twist. Things I'll Be Thinking About Until Next Week:
* None It's really just one thing this week. It's little but also ... big? At the beginning of this episode, as in Episode 3, we find ourselves back at Trivia Night, reliving the first seconds after Perry's death. This week, though, a trembling Celeste can be heard shouting, ""I pushed him!"" Madeline convinces Celeste she did not, then turns to Bonnie to absolve her as well. The scene ends when Madeline jolts awake. Is this dream merely a vehicle to give us more specifics about what happened, or does it suggest something deeper? Did Celeste, amid the chaos, momentarily believe she pushed Perry? Was she perhaps asserting that she was willing to take the rap? Was she just being figurative?

Technology,"Just Embed a Phone Into This Editor's Mind, Already",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/24/technology/personaltech/smartphone-styles-choire-sicha.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Choire Sicha, the editor of the Styles desk at The Times, which reports on everything from weddings and fashion to social change and self-care, discussed the tech he's using. What does your tech setup look like? And what do you do to make it look stylish? Like 19 out of 20 Americans, according to the Pew Research Center, I have a mobile phone. Like those belonging to three out of four Americans, according to the same, mine is a janky hand-held device that I use for talking, playing games, reading, writing, taking photographs, keeping in touch with friends, checking weather, hate-reading, Netflixing, learning chords to 1980s songs from websites that probably give me weird viruses and creating expressions of my identity to display to strangers across the internet. Why do we do that? I use this phone more than I use my office laptop. I use this phone more than I use any other device in my life, including my television. Sometimes instead of turning on the television I will just watch television on my phone. Don't tell David Lynch!

I also should stop calling it my phone, because I do not make phone calls on it, because phones are fairly useless as phones and mostly because the phones are infested with incessant spam calls that apparently, as with school shootings, food-borne illness incidents and the removal of registered voters from the rolls, we are incapable as a society of preventing in any way. Also, because I am on an Android phone (a Pixel XL), none of my friends will text with me, and it makes me sad. They love their beloved iMessage on their beloved, stupid iPhones. Companies don't care about us, or at least not me. They care about themselves (and about not paying taxes in America, and I get that, truly, I have been there myself).

My phone does have a New York Fashion Week PopSocket on it, though, and I'm a real PopSocket convert! It makes reading in bed great again. What's so janky about your setup? What features or tools are on your wish list to make it better? It's agonizing and surreal that for this funny time-window in human society there is an annual New Phone Season. Each year we are besieged by very barely updated versions of existing phones that are larger and more expensive than ever, and usually just as fragile. As the New Phone Season approaches each year -- it's usually September to October, when Google, Samsung, Apple and others either bring out or announce their annual lines -- one tries ever more desperately to time the death of one's primary digital device to coincide with it.

And now the decision time is here, and I'm unhappy. The more I'm put in the position of deciding whether I will spend more than $1,000 on a ""phone"" (as the prime large-size offering from each of the three major companies ends up being more than two weeks' take-home pay for a Whole Foods employee) or daringly branch out into the slightly less premier brands, the more I realize how awful it is that these disgusting, beeping, needy Tamagotchis are my most constant companion. I have a more active friendship and, to be honest, romantic life with my phone than I do with almost any humans. Can this be good for me? Am I an experiment? At the very least I would like them to make digital devices that aren't incredibly fragile and scratchable. Right now, until they just punch the circuitry into the back of our skull, like the way they murder cows, we have to carry these things around as if they were tiny flat glass babies. Will I buy an iPhone? A Note 9? A Pixel 3? Will I buy a one-way ticket off this crazy thing and set myself free? Not as long as I have a job, I suppose. *Looks around office nervously* In the end, as you can see in the pictures, I finally bought a Samsung Galaxy Note 9. The biggest trend around the world is that nearly every man now has a worn-in rectangle in the front pocket of his jeans. I also predict that hand-enlargement surgery for women will briefly become a trend until the time of the, you know, putting the phones into the skull bones. Then there are no more worries!

What other tech product are you currently obsessed with? The majority of my tech use actually occurs while I sleep. I have a Wirecutter-endorsed Coway air filter, which may or may not be doing anything but I love it to death, and a small symphony of Dyson fans and Bose noise machines that create an envelope of air and sound all around me, as if Kate Bush were constantly twirling at high speed while I dream the night away. This setup saves marriages and also soothes cats. If you sleep in silence next to someone, you are doing it wrong! The tongue of this whooshing envelope, if you will, actually intrudes into my person in the form of a small plastic mandibular advancement device. It's a kind of fancy mouth guard, and the technological arms race around sleep apnea is fascinating. For instance, while I was being fitted with this device -- it gently juts the jaw forward, basically, allowing you to breathe while you sleep and not rush toward death as quickly -- it was casually mentioned that if it didn't fit handily, they could install little bumps on my teeth that would fit into slots in the device, locking it in overnight, in a real steampunk nightmare of medical intervention. It fit. Does your lover or spouse report that your snoring is terrible? Do you feel exhausted in the morning? Do you feel like you have a cold all the time but you don't? Do you wake up suddenly at night screaming in panic? No, wait, that last one's normal. The rest of you, visit an otorhinolaryngologist today!","Choire Sicha, who runs The New York Times's Styles desk, has such a close relationship with his smartphone, he says, it may be time to ""punch the circuitry into the back of our skull.""",67b65a08-f025-557d-b0ae-b3303258328d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/25/business/25techusing/merlin_145743483_27c9bd43-8a12-4fb9-bfcb-80981930af40-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f56eb4cfcdb0f552d58246887639ddfedf7fc8b557fd07426faaf1c46a1e8056&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Choire Sicha, styles editor for The New York Times, says, ""I use this phone more than I use any other device in my life.""",67b65a08-f025-557d-b0ae-b3303258328d,N24News/imgs/67b65a08-f025-557d-b0ae-b3303258328d.jpg,20
Books,"Robert A. Caro, Private Eye",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/16/books/review/robert-a-caro-working.html,"""Working"" is a squib for Robert A. Caro. It barely tops 200 pages. His first masterpiece, ""The Power Broker,"" 1,336 pages published in 1974, investigated how ruthlessly Commissioner Robert Moses, never elected to anything, concreted the metropolis of Manhattan, tying it to distant suburbs by expressways, bridges, parkways and beaches. Caro's four subsequent biographies, thousands of pages about the life of our 36th president, Lyndon Johnson, await only the capstone of the fifth to complete the chronicle of the last great social-political reform movement of the American century. So this new Caro is not the long-promised fifth volume, not about the collision with Bobby Kennedy, or the much-misreported advent of the Great Society, or the president's years of war in Vietnam, where Caro left us with young G.I.s wading through the Mekong River, holding their rifles above their heads waist deep in the Big Muddy and, as Pete Seeger lamented, the ""big fool"" said to push on. And so they did. ""Working"" is Caro's selection of observations, as its subtitle tells us, on the arts of researching, interviewing and writing. Some are drawn from his experiences writing about Robert Moses and Johnson, some freshly minted, some culled from earlier interviews. Inevitably, with selections, there are repetitions and occasional lapses of style: Before we have warmed up, there's a head-spinning single sentence of almost 170 words. And yet Caro's squib about working is iridescent, so many brilliant refractions of light from his hard slog of discovering what life has really meant for the people in his narratives, the powerful and the powerless.

At Princeton the acerbic literary critic R. P. Blackmur precisely identified a course correction for his undergraduate short-story aspirant: ""You're never going to achieve what you want to, Mr. Caro, if you don't stop thinking with your fingers."" What Blackmur meant was that Mr. Caro couldn't just type ""The young congressman Lyndon Johnson's rural electrification program was a boon"" and leave it at that. He had to work out how Johnson got it done and won the adulation of more than 200,000 Texas Hill Country people -- what their lives had been like working ""dark to dark"" before ""the lights"" arrived at their isolated homes, with maybe 30 miles of dirt road to the next place. Caro is steeped in humility. He took Blackmur's advice. He slowed down. Thought takes time. Truth takes time. When the research had filled in the blanks, he compiled first drafts in longhand, second and third and fourth drafts, too, and on a Smith-Corona Electra 210, writing 1,000 words a day. Philip Larkin observed that ""someone will forever be surprising / A hunger in himself to be more serious."" This is what Caro responded to. One sometimes feels he might have followed a religious career, but the origin of his empathy is more prosaic. He discovered within himself a redemptive hunger that still perplexes him even after decades of literary and popular triumph. He can't stop asking questions. He suspects that behind every answer there is another question. Most good reporters I know have a full quiver of ""whys?"" but Caro is insatiable. He is incapable of dispensing bromides.

As a newspaper reporter, he came to hate having to write a story while there were still questions, still documents he hadn't checked. Wasn't it just meaningless to tap out the phrase ""the human cost of highways"" if he hadn't himself walked the New York City neighborhood called East Tremont, which was razed for the Cross-Bronx Expressway; if he hadn't spent days interviewing black and poor tenants evicted from apartments now derelict, ""the stench of urine and of piles of feces in corners ... so thick in the lobbies it made your eyes tear""? The Caros were ""plain broke"" from the seven years working on ""The Power Broker."" While Caro worried and worried, Ina, his wife, Argus-eyed researcher and intellectual twin, sold their house in Roslyn, Long Island. One day, when a few dollars came from The New Yorker for excerpts from ""The Power Broker,"" she was able to break the news of their predicament: ""Now I can go to the dry cleaners again.""

For his work on Lyndon Johnson, Robert and Ina went to live on the edge of the Hill Country to learn from ranchers and farmers about Johnson's boyhood and young manhood. Of course Caro could not stop asking questions about everything, every day of everyone. He had the tables turned on him by a taciturn woman whose exasperation with tomfool questions forced her to blurt out: ""You're a city boy. You don't know how heavy a bucket of water is, do you?"" He had to understand what it meant in the 1930s and 1940s, when every day, for hand-washing clothes and cooking, the wives had to bring up water from a deep well a way down from the house. Then they'd have to stand over a hot wood stove to press the heaps of washing with heavy iron bars. So Caro took the woman's old bucket with a long frayed rope, dropped it in the deep well and heaved it up again. Heavy, yes! Being Caro, he took his questions to a 1940 Agriculture Department study. It told him he'd have to haul up 40 gallons a day for each person. He had to imagine a Hill Country family of five collecting 200 gallons a day, carried back to the house two buckets at a time, with the people yoked like cattle to a heavy bar of wood across the shoulder. Caro insists that the three years he and Ina spent in the Hill Country weren't a sacrifice. ""Getting a chance to learn, being forced to learn -- really learn so that I could write about it in depth"" was ""an opportunity to explore, to discover, a whole new world when you were already in your 40s."" It was ""a privilege, exciting. The two of us remember those years as a thrilling, wonderful adventure."" The phrase Caro recited in his sleep (I'm guessing) was ""Papers don't die; people do."" So he had to get to the right people as soon as he could to know where to look for the papers. And the papers were all too often the only source for identifying the individuals who might have answers to his proliferating questions. The papers! Consider walking into the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum in Austin for the first time, past the presidential armored limousine, and the assault on your senses of thousands and thousands of boxes of papers, 40,000, each with a capacity of 800 pages. As the archivist said, yessir, that's 32 million pages awaiting your attention.

Somewhere unflagged in the millions was a Western Union telegram to George Brown, a Texas contractor. Faded since its transmission on Oct. 19, 1940, it was the key to how the obscure 32-year-old Johnson had suddenly acquired power and prestige and won the ear of ""the Boss,"" Franklin Roosevelt. But George Brown at 79 was determined to honor a lifetime pledge to his adored late brother, Herman: Never, never on any occasion talk to an interviewer. How Caro finds what he needs to know about the secrecy of Johnson's ascent from Brown is par for the author's tenacity, his charm and his investigative genius, no other word for it. So is the way he settles Johnson's famously controversial senatorial election victory over Gov. Coke Stevenson by 87 votes in 1948. The imbroglio of gossip in the Rio Grande Valley, of different-colored ballots and court rulings, had led to a federal investigation finally closed by a Supreme Court justice in Washington with orders that it never be reopened. That wasn't good enough for Caro. Nearly 40 years later he tried to find Luis Salas, a big bruiser of a deputy sheriff who had once killed a man in a barroom brawl. Salas was the election judge who, under oath, had certified 200 disputed votes for Johnson in the notorious Ballot Box 13. But Salas was nowhere to be found. He was said to be living in Mexico. Caro was able to stop looking in March 1986. He knocked on the door of a mobile home near Houston, and the frail old man of 84 who answered was only too pleased to fish out from a trunk a 94-page history titled ""Box 13,"" which described how he had switched votes from Stevenson to Johnson. He was proud of deceiving everyone. ""We put L. B. Johnson as senator for Texas, and this position opened the road to reach the presidency."" Never again would Caro have to equivocate, ""No one will ever be sure if Lyndon Johnson stole it."" Now, in ""Working,"" he writes yet another definitive sentence: He stole it. Nearly 200 years ago, James Madison commanded that a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power that knowledge gives. Robert Caro, the young man who gave up thinking with his fingers, has performed great deeds in that cause, but he has also measurably enriched our lives with his intellectual rigor, his compassion, his openness, his wit and grace.","Caro's ""Working: Researching, Interviewing, Writing"" describes a lifetime of digging for facts.",e1d2f845-e8b2-5a07-9303-a381e13c96ee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/21/books/review/21Evans-COVER/21Evans-COVER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=6070391481e2785e24af9a57f51ed4191256181373f713ba01cf3aca1830705d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert A.

Style,"White Customers, Black Fabrics",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/06/style/white-customers-black-fabrics.html,"The recent outpouring of support for Black-owned businesses has brought attention to fashion labels that work with African prints. The labels, many of them founded by West African designers living in the United States and Britain, are turning the traditional patterns of West African fabric into contemporary American silhouettes. ""May was our biggest month ever, and June is going to be bigger than May,"" said Addie Elabor, the founder and designer of D'iyanu, an African print label introduced in 2014. Nicolette Orji, also known as Nikki Billie Jean, the founder of the All Things Ankara blog and a designer herself, was similarly upbeat. ""Anyone who is selling anything online right now is feeling that support, and it's amazing -- though kind of overdue."" While the largest market for most of these designers is Black people born and raised in America, success this year has also brought new buyers.

""When I first released my masks, one of my white friends texted me to say, 'Can I buy this or would that be a bad idea?'"" said Maya Lake, the founder of Boxing Kitten, the label that is often credited as one of the first to put ankara print on the American fashion radar. ""I said she should buy it. I mean, especially now if you want to support Black-owned businesses. I think it's fine."" But, Ms. Lake said, there is an important distinction between non-Black buyers using their money to support Black designers and non-Black designers using African-associated prints to make money for themselves. ""As a Black American, I relate to the fabric in a different way,"" she said. ""If someone doesn't have a personal connection, culturally, to the fabric, that's not cool,"" she said, referring to fashion houses like Stella McCartney, which got pushback for using ankara prints. ""Just going to a place and studying a thing doesn't mean you can co-opt it to make money.""

The distinction between buyers and designers is an important one for many in the industry. ""I would like to see African print everywhere,"" said Yetunde Olukoya, a Nigerian-born designer who moved to the United States with her husband when she was 26. ""As long as it's made in Africa, and puts value back into the people who actually made this fashion popular, then I would love to see it worn all over the world.""

Ray Darten, the label she started in her living room in 2016 with 160 pieces she sewed by hand, now employs more than 100 workers in Nigeria. For Ms. Olukoya, ankara print clothing counters the narratives that too often associate much of Africa with poverty and disease. ""Americans needed to learn that there are beautiful things that come out of here,"" she said. Ms. Olukoya estimates that about 80 percent of her customer base is African-American. For Ms. Elabor, who moved to the United States from Nigeria as a child, it is important that any designer who popularizes African print should be of African descent. ""Otherwise, it would make it seem like we had to wait for another race to come and use this before the world could see it as popular,"" she said. Ms. Orji, of All Things Ankara, has seen a sharp increase in white buyers on her site in the last month, a trend she welcomes. She does publish photographs of non-Black models in ankara print. ""If we want these prints to go viral, then we need more people to use them,"" she said. Part of what is driving the current conversation is that while African-born designers see African print as a way to spread their culture, they are selling it in a country that has its own separate history and relationship to these fabrics.

Many people in America -- of all colors -- grew up associating African print clothing with expressions of Black pride, based on its popularity during the civil rights era and its use in the Black Power movement as a way to show solidarity and connection with one's African heritage. They see the fashion not as a way to spread African culture, but to reclaim it. ""The first time a customer cried in one of my pop-up shops, I didn't know what to do,"" said Ms. Olukoya of Ray Darten. ""But then as she began to explain to me how she felt, I started crying as well. I'm Nigerian, I know where I am from, and I can't imagine what it would feel like if I didn't know where I was from. It's not just about the clothes on the racks. It's about being confident in them, and confident in the culture."" Abiye Yvonne Dede, a British designer born in Nigeria and the founder of the clothing line L'aviye, estimates that about 70 percent of her business comes from the United States, with African-Americans being her largest demographic. A few weeks ago, she put up an Instagram post in which she wore her designs alongside models in L'aviye clothes. ""Because we're always being asked if L'aviye is Black owned,"" the caption read. Comments came quickly: ""Now I can buy. I did research and could not find if it was black owned. My bank account is already crying!!!""

""As I sat on vacation, looking basic because I had nothing else to wear, I decided to start pursuing swimsuits,"" Buki Ade said about why she founded Bfyne, a swimwear company known for its innovative use of straps, sleeves and prints drawn from her Nigerian heritage. ""In these designs, you can walk into the room and you don't have to say a word because your outfit has already introduced you,"" she said. ""It's a vibe."" Recent months have brought more attention, including in Allure and Elle, magazines she believes would not have known about her label if not for a heightened awareness of Black designers. She is grateful for the attention but finds it hard to think about the reason so many Black designers are suddenly being given the spotlight. With the notable exception of kente cloth, many recognizable African prints today are based on Indonesian batiks. Known as African wax block prints, or Dutch wax prints, they were introduced to West Africa by Dutch merchants in the mid-1800s, after the Dutch tried to imitate traditional batik fabrics through machine-made work but found that their mechanized fabrics failed to penetrate the Indonesian market.

Vlisco, a Dutch fabric company established in the Netherlands in 1846, designed and produced cloth sold all over West Africa. Today it continues to design many of the most popular fabrics sold in the region, though the cloth itself is named and given its particular cultural significance by local women. Even dashiki tops, as popularized in the United States in the late 1960s, were styled from Vlisco's Angelina print, which in turn was taken from a longstanding West African tunic design. For centuries, patterns have been a way to communicate without saying a word, and it can be jarring for some to see these designs worn without regard to their original messages. (Some of the cloth used now for shorts, halter dresses and jumpsuits holds specific meaning in Nigeria or Ghana, where it may signal that one is pregnant, newly married or mourning a relative.) But others say there is no way to stop cultural innovation. ""There is a time to say you want to wear something because you look really good in it, and you like it,"" said Paulette Young, the director of the Young Robertson Gallery in New York, which specializes in the visual arts of Africa. ""And that's OK, too."" Ms. Young wrote her dissertation on the Dutch origins of African wax fabrics. Scot Brown, an associate professor at U.C.L.A. and a historian of African-American social movements and popular culture, is not worried about whether ankara print will lose its significance for the African-American community if it goes mainstream. Though he loves his D'iyanu blazers, he sees the innovative use of this print for Western business clothes as another sign that African fashion will constantly evolve and adapt to changing conditions.","Black-owned businesses make amazing clothing inspired by African patterns.

The solution? Invest in interesting, well-designed coasters that you'll be happy to leave lying around and guests will enjoy using.

Given that, you may want to own several styles.

""You might think about changing up the coasters depending on the sorts of drinks you're serving,"" said Mr. Briars, who is also an owner of a travel-themed bar called Clipper, in Auckland, New Zealand, where bartenders have been known to match cocktails to coasters depicting the countries in which the drinks were created.","Sure, they protect your furniture.

Science,The Lasting Lessons of John Conway's Game of Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/science/math-conway-game-of-life.html,"""Life in Life,"" from a short documentary on the Game of Life by Alan Zucconi, a London-based lecturer and science communicator.Credit...



""Life in Life,"" from a short documentary on the Game of Life by Alan Zucconi, a London-based lecturer and science communicator.

In March of 1970, Martin Gardner opened a letter jammed with ideas for his Mathematical Games column in Scientific American. Sent by John Horton Conway, then a mathematician at the University of Cambridge, the letter ran 12 pages, typed hunt-and-peck style. Page 9 began with the heading ""The game of life."" It described an elegant mathematical model of computation -- a cellular automaton, a little machine, of sorts, with groups of cells that evolve from iteration to iteration, as a clock advances from one second to the next. Dr. Conway, who died in April, having spent the latter part of his career at Princeton, sometimes called Life a ""no-player, never-ending game."" Mr. Gardner called it a ""fantastic solitaire pastime."" The game was simple: Place any configuration of cells on a grid, then watch what transpires according to three rules that dictate how the system plays out.

Birth rule: An empty, or ""dead,"" cell with precisely three ""live"" neighbors (full cells) becomes live. Death rule: A live cell with zero or one neighbors dies of isolation; a live cell with four or more neighbors dies of overcrowding. Survival rule: A live cell with two or three neighbors remains alive. With each iteration, some cells live, some die and ""Life-forms"" evolve, one generation to the next. Among the first creatures to emerge was the glider -- a five-celled organism that moved across the grid with a diagonal wiggle and proved handy for transmitting information. It was discovered by a member of Dr. Conway's research team, Richard Guy, in Cambridge, England. The glider gun, producing a steady stream of gliders, was discovered soon after by Bill Gosper, then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Life swiftly eclipsed Dr. Conway's many other mathematical accomplishments, and he came to regard his missive to Mr. Gardner as ""the fatal letter."" The Game of Life motivated the use of cellular automata in the rich field of complexity science, with simulations modeling everything from ants to traffic, clouds to galaxies. More trivially, the game attracted a cult of ""Lifenthusiasts,"" programmers who spent a lot of time hacking Life -- that is, constructing patterns in hopes of spotting new Life-forms. To mark the 50th anniversary, the ConwayLife.com community -- which hosts the LifeWiki, with more than 2,000 articles -- created an Exploratorium, a large, explorable stamp-collection pattern. Patterns that didn't change one generation to the next, Dr. Conway called still lifes -- such as the four-celled block, the six-celled beehive or the eight-celled pond. Patterns that took a long time to stabilize, he called methuselahs. The tree of Life also includes oscillators, such as the blinker, and spaceships of various sizes (the glider being the smallest). In 2018, there was a much-celebrated discovery of a special kind of spaceship, the first elementary knightship, named Sir Robin. Made of hundreds of cells, it moves two cells forward and one sideways every six generations. It was discovered by Adam P. Goucher, a British algorithmist, building on an earlier partial find by Tomas Rokicki, a developer of Golly, a program for exploring the distant future of large Life patterns.

And the hunting party continues. In September, Pavel Grankovskiy, of Russia, discovered the Speed Demonoid spaceship. In December, John Winston Garth, of Alabama, discovered the Doo-dah spaceship. Both are contenders for pattern of the year, in what has been a good year for new Life discoveries. Life ultimately became way too popular for Dr. Conway's liking. Whenever the subject came up, he would bellow, ""I hate Life!"" But in his final years he learned to love Life again. He narrated a documentary, with the working title ""Thoughts on Life,"" by the Brooklyn-based mathematician and filmmaker Will Cavendish, exploring the deterministic Game of Life versus the Free Will Theorem, a result Dr. Conway proved with his Princeton colleague Simon Kochen. ""I used to go around saying, 'I hate Life,'"" Dr. Conway says in the film. ""But then I was giving a lecture somewhere, and I was introduced as 'John Conway, Creator of Life.' And I thought, 'Oh, that's quite a nice way to be known.' So I stopped saying 'I hate Life' after that."" Recently, some of Life's most steadfast friends reflected upon its influence and lessons over half a century.

These days it has become harder and harder for an amateur to find a newsworthy pattern without fancy software and hardware. Perhaps Life can remain a gateway drug, luring newcomers into the effectively inexhaustible universe of different Lifelike rules. I first encountered Life at the Exploratorium in San Francisco in 1978. I was hooked immediately by the thing that has always hooked me -- watching complexity arise out of simplicity. Life ought to be very predictable and boring; after all, there are just three simple rules that determine the position of some dots on a grid. That really doesn't sound very interesting until you start tweaking those rules and watching what changes. Life shows you two things. The first is sensitivity to initial conditions. A tiny change in the rules can produce a huge difference in the output, ranging from complete destruction (no dots) through stasis (a frozen pattern) to patterns that keep changing as they unfold. The second thing Life shows us is something that Darwin hit upon when he was looking at Life, the organic version. Complexity arises from simplicity! That is such a revelation; we are used to the idea that anything complex must arise out of something more complex. Human brains design airplanes, not the other way around. Life shows us complex virtual ""organisms"" arising out of the interaction of a few simple rules -- so goodbye ""Intelligent Design."" Given that Conway's proof that the Game of Life can be made to simulate a Universal Computer -- that is, it could be ""programmed"" to carry out any computation that a traditional computer can do -- the extremely simple rules can give rise to the most complex and most unpredictable behavior possible. This means that there are certain properties of the Game of Life that can never be predicted, even in principle! In this moment in time, it's important to emphasize that inherent unpredictability -- so well illustrated in even the simple Game of Life -- is a feature of life in the real world as well as in the Game of Life. We have to figure out ways to flourish in spite of the inherent unpredictability and uncertainty we constantly live with. As the mathematician John Allen Paulos so eloquently said, ""Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security."" This is, I think, Life's most important lesson.

I use the Game of Life to make vivid for my students the ideas of determinism, higher-order patterns and information. One of its great features is that nothing is hidden; there are no black boxes in Life, so you know from the outset that anything that you can get to happen in the Life world is completely unmysterious and explicable in terms of a very large number of simple steps by small items. No psionic fields, no morphic resonances, no elan vital, no dualism. It's all right there. And the fact that it can still support complex adaptively appropriate structures that do things is also important. In Thomas Pynchon's novel ""Gravity's Rainbow,"" a character says, ""But you had taken on a greater and more harmful illusion. The illusion of control. That A could do B. But that was false. Completely. No one can do. Things only happen."" This is compelling but wrong, and Life is a great way of showing this. In Life, we might say, things only happen at the pixel level; nothing controls anything, nothing does anything. But that doesn't mean that there is no such thing as action, as control; it means that these are higher-level phenomena composed (entirely, with no magic) from things that only happen.

In the Artificial Life community, Life is a foundational piece of work. It sits in the background, influencing the way people think of life ""in silico."" Life probably maintains its interest for two reasons. One is that the whole field of cellular automata is very important, because computationally it can be used to model so many different things -- for example, physical systems from fluid dynamics to coupled magnetic spins to chemical reaction-diffusion systems. The other reason is that it's just cool and pretty and great to look at. When you speed it up, it flows and boils and bubbles; it actually comes to look alive. I did some work with students looking at Life on a Penrose tiling grid, rather than the square grid. I wanted to know whether it was the rules or the grid that was the important thing. We found some interesting oscillating patterns and snakelike patterns. Basically, what we showed is that there is something in those rules; the rules are producing the interesting dynamics. Penrose Life still generates interesting behaviors, even in a different environment.

When Life started out, we didn't yet have the notion of mathematical chaos. The unfolding of the successive generations of a Game of Life board is completely deterministic. If you start with the same setup, you always get the same outcomes. The odd thing is that, even though the results of a given game of Life start-position are predetermined, there is no easy shortcut to predict these outcomes. You just have to run the damn thing through all its steps. That's what chaos is about. The Game of Life, or a kinky dynamical system like a pair of pendulums, or a candle flame, or an ocean wave, or the growth of a plant -- they aren't readily predictable. But they are not random. They do obey laws, and there are certain kinds of patterns -- chaotic attractors -- that they tend to produce. But again, unpredictable is not random. An important and subtle distinction which changed my whole view of the world. -- Author of ""The Recursive Universe: Cosmic Complexity and the Limits of Scientific Knowledge,"" Los Angeles, Calif.

The Game of Life's pulsing, pyrotechnic constellations are classic examples of emergent phenomena, introduced decades before that adjective became a buzzword. Fifty years later, the misfortunes of 2020 are the stuff of memes. The biggest challenges facing us today are emergent: viruses leaping from species to species; the abrupt onset of wildfires and tropical storms as a consequence of a small rise in temperature; economies in which billions of free transactions lead to staggering concentrations of wealth; an internet that becomes more fraught with hazard each year. Looming behind it all is our collective vision of an artificial intelligence-fueled future that is certain to come with surprises, not all of them pleasant. The name Conway chose -- the Game of Life -- frames his invention as a metaphor. But I'm not sure that even he anticipated how relevant Life would become, and that in 50 years we'd all be playing an emergent game of life and death.","Fifty years on, the mathematician's best known (and, to him, least favorite) creation confirms that ""uncertainty is the only certainty.""",d7888abe-c1a5-53d6-8b98-72261f676088,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/29/science/00SCI-CONWAY1/00SCI-CONWAY1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,"John Horton Conway, investigating &ldquo;Life&rdquo; in 1974.",d7888abe-c1a5-53d6-8b98-72261f676088,N24News/imgs/d7888abe-c1a5-53d6-8b98-72261f676088.jpg,2
Health,Trump Disinfectant Remarks Echo Claims by Miracle-Cure Quacks,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/health/coronavirus-disinfectant-bleach-trump.html,"President Trump's public statements about using disinfectants to potentially treat the coronavirus have put him in the company of pseudoscientists and purveyors of phony elixirs who promote and sell industrial bleach as a ""miracle cure"" for autism, malaria and a long list of medical conditions. The president's comments, at a White House briefing last week, have already prompted widespread incredulity, warnings from health experts and a spike in calls to poison control centers around the country. The makers of Clorox and Lysol urged Americans not to inject or ingest their products. But some scientists fear Mr. Trump's remarks could breathe life into a fringe movement that embraces the medicinal powers of a powerful industrial bleach known as chlorine dioxide. Among its adherents are Alan Keyes, the conservative activist and former presidential candidate who has promoted a chlorine dioxide-based product called Miracle Mineral Solution on his online television show. The impact of Trump's words ""is going to be huge, especially among people who are desperate,"" said Myles Power, a British chemist who works to debunk quack medical remedies. ""My fear is it will cause widespread harm to people who think that drinking bleach can prevent or cure Covid-19.""

Mark Grenon, the self-described archbishop of a Florida church that sells Miracle Mineral Solution as ""a wonderful detox that can kill 99% of the pathogens in the body,"" took credit for Mr. Trump's comments in a Facebook post on Friday. In an online radio show earlier this month, he said that he and his supporters had sent letters to the president about the product he peddles. The White House did not respond to an email seeking comment after Mr. Grenon's letter was reported by The Guardian last week. A person with knowledge of senior administration officials said they were not familiar with him or his letter. It is unclear what inspired Mr. Trump to suggest disinfectants as a cure for Covid-19 -- and he did not mention chlorine dioxide or bleach specifically in his comments during the White House briefing. But promoters of such solutions have seized on his remarks with vigor. ""Do you realize how freaking cheap and easy it would be to mass produce chlorine dioxide for 100,000's of people?"" Jordan Sather, a follower of the pro-Trump QAnon conspiracy theory, wrote on Twitter. ""We could wipe out COVID quick!"" In a statement earlier this month, the Food and Drug Administration reiterated its warnings about ingesting chlorine dioxide, which it described as ""dangerous and unapproved."" Chlorine dioxide is widely used in paper processing, by water treatment plants and as a disinfectant in hospitals.

""We will not stand for this, and the FDA remains fully committed to taking strong enforcement action against any sellers who place unsuspecting American consumers at risk by offering their unproven products to treat serious diseases,"" the administration's commissioner, Stephen M. Hahn, said in the statement. Mr. Grenon and his son, Jonathan, who helps run the church, did not respond to interview requests sent via Facebook. Chlorine dioxide has also been embraced by vaccine opponents who say the toxic substance treats autism. Emma Dalmayne, a mother of five autistic children who maintains a website about the dangers of so-called bleach cures, said the treatments have left some children with skin burns, seizures, damaged digestive tracts and other injuries. ""The harm done to these kids has been unconscionable,"" she said. Melissa Eaton, a mother of an autistic child in North Carolina who campaigns against phony cures, said she sees overlaps between those who embrace chlorine dioxide as a curative, conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones, and the strident protesters who have clamored for loosening social distancing measures across the country. ""It's like a Venn diagram,"" she said. ""What they all have in common is the idea that the government is hiding something from you. These people are not interested in what scientists, doctors or the mainstream media has to say. "" Dr. Alan Levinovitz, a professor at James Madison University who studies the relationship between science and religion, said Mr. Trump's comments about disinfectants were in keeping with his previous support for conspiracy theorists, agitators against the deep-state and his promotion of two antimalarial drugs to fight the coronavirus, despite warnings from medical experts about their possible dangerous side effects. ""For a lot of people, Trump represents an alternative to pointy-headed experts in white lab coats who speak a language we can't understand,"" he said. ""When you feel existentially threatened by a deadly virus, and the president says you can take control of your health with a product in your kitchen cabinet, that's incredibly empowering.""",Doctors and public health officials fear the attention could boost purveyors of dangerous elixirs who push 'miracle cures' with no basis in science.,ad0ee709-b589-5c8d-bd98-0530e29ddeb7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/27/science/27VIRUS-BLEACH/27VIRUS-BLEACH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5d532e405a8b8c563b85e5f82d9dedd6d3b9cbff89baf789db29f2b5f6d559d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump during a presentation by NASA officials on their coronavirus projects at the White House on Friday.,ad0ee709-b589-5c8d-bd98-0530e29ddeb7,N24News/imgs/ad0ee709-b589-5c8d-bd98-0530e29ddeb7.jpg,1
