Art & Design,"Sarah Lucas, Unmasked: From Perverse to Profound",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/arts/design/sarah-lucas-new-museum.html,"Credit...Ana Cuba for The New York Times





""A rude woman is really what we need right now,"" a veteran of the New York art scene said to me last May, just weeks before several assertive female political candidates started to emerge and even win some primaries. In this case, however, the rude woman under discussion was the pre-eminent British sculptor Sarah Lucas, whose first American museum retrospective -- and largest exhibition of her work yet -- will open at the New Museum on Sept. 26. It may cause some art world jaws to drop. Prolific and provocative, yet not widely known this side of the Atlantic, Ms. Lucas is an original member of the Young British Artists (Y.B.A.s), the group Damien Hirst -- while still in art school -- introduced in 1988 with the ""Freeze"" exhibition, helping to rocket the London art scene to international status. She established herself abruptly in London four years later with ""Penis Nailed to a Board,"" her first solo gallery show. The title came from a work that incorporates a sensational article -- and its headline -- from The Sunday Sport, a British tabloid that's now defunct. [Never miss a show again. Add this fall's most anticipated cultural events directly to your calendar.]

She wasn't even sure what art was for. She said the issue bothered her quite a bit. Also, the male Y.B.A.s were getting most of the attention. ""I was quite reconciled to people not being so interested in me, but that freed me up,"" she said. ""I could experiment with materials, only pleasing myself."" She came to realize, she added, that ""I could really have a lot of fun, humor, between me and me."" By 1991, Ms. Lucas was making big collages from the most offensive Sport spreads. (An example, ""Fat, Forty and Flabulous,"" is in the retrospective.) Reading the feminist Andrea Dworkin helped her ""see the extent to which everything is stacked against women,"" she said. Dworkin also wrote about exploitive tabloid images, which encouraged Ms. Lucas to think she ""could mobilize this hateful stuff to my own purpose,"" she added. Part of that purpose was to explore an unsettling ambiguity: Are such images titillating, offensive, tragic or some combination thereof? Ms. Lucas feels that the tabloid spreads symbolize the position of all women, not just those in the images. And more: ""You can identify with men as much as women,"" she said. ""They coexist."" Since then, Ms. Lucas's art has specialized in rudeness -- although unvarnished honesty with a moral undertone may be more accurate. The phallus -- whose depiction in Western art has been one of the most persistent taboos since the end of the Classical era -- is a ubiquitous form in her work. (You might think that she wants to equal the attention male artists have lavished upon female breasts throughout history.) Intercourse is frequently intimated, and a tender sarcasm is the prevailing tone. Titles can include profanities and other slang learned on the streets of Islington, the London borough where she grew up. Her materials are cheap and familiar: old furniture, toilets, cinder blocks, underwear, cans of Spam and the stuffed pantyhose. Cars, traditionally a male obsession, also figure in: variously crushed, bisected, burned or carefully collaged with a layer of cigarettes, as are other objects. Fruits and vegetables, kebabs and whole raw chickens do double service, portraying erotic body parts.

Even if you know how good Ms. Lucas is as an artist, there's a chance you don't know all the different ways she's good, how consistently tough her fusion of politics, aesthetics and the grit of life has been, and how it has deepened over the years, especially formally. Ms. Lucas speaks of ""the necessity of actual boldness"" in art. ""It's hard to keep that sense of necessity,"" she said. She has succeeded to an unusual extent, perhaps partly because she has never had a permanent studio, which may enforce an implicitly improvisatory mode that keeps her work fresh and on edge. There's also the increasing richness with which her art connects to the history of modern sculpture, beginning with Dada and Surrealism. For starters, her toilets could be seen as female rejoinders to Duchamp's urinal, and, of course, her work is riddled with variations on the ready-made. Magritte, Louise Bourgeois, Gilbert & George, Martin Kippenberger and especially the sculptor Franz West are among her influences, as well as the humble materials of Italian Arte Povera and Post-Minimalism. Her work is dotted with amused asides, including fluorescent light fixtures -- a signature of the Minimalist Dan Flavin -- used as penises.

The New Museum show includes a short video, ""Egg Massage,"" made with her partner, the artist Julian Simmons, with whom she lives in Suffolk, northeast of London, and frequently collaborates. (They also have a London residence.) In it Mr. Simmons lies naked on a kitchen table, while Ms. Lucas breaks eggs and smears them over his body. A spontaneous event, it happened after dinner at the house of Ms. Lucas's close friend and longtime art dealer, Sadie Coles. (Her two dinner guests had a lot of eggs in their car: Christmas was coming.) The New Museum show may have its own egg-splattered wall. ""I'm quite a domestic person,"" Ms. Lucas told me. She described working for the New Museum show at her friend Matthew Barney's studio in Long Island City, Queens, where she was readying one of the exhibition's two largest pieces: a 2003 Jaguar that had been cut lengthwise, with one-half burned and the other collaged with cigarettes. (Its title, ""This Jaguar's Going to Heaven,"" rephrases the Pixies song title ""This Monkey's Gone to Heaven"" and also weaponizes it, since jaguars, one of the world's great predators, have probably dispatched plenty of monkeys.) The other work will be an 11-foot-tall pair of over-the-knee platform boots in cast concrete, redolent of sidewalks, streetwalkers, drag and great-man public sculpture. I'd met Ms. Lucas in the early 1990s in New York, but hadn't seen her, except in passing, in 20 years. She seemed nearly unchanged: tall and thin, with slack brown hair just above her shoulders, and a lean, no-frills yet delicate British face, devoid of makeup, that she has called ""plain."" As usual, she wore a shirt, jeans and substantial, thick-soled shoes, an ensemble that might have been determined by the age of 11 or 12 and barely altered since. This is the uniform seen in her frequent self-portraits, and is by now as familiar as Joseph Beuys's vest and hat or Andy Warhol's navy blazer and school tie.

Born in London, Ms. Lucas, 55, grew up on a council estate, one of four children. She held part-time jobs from the age of 13 until she graduated from Goldsmiths College -- where many of the initial Y.B.A.s met -- in 1987. A D.I.Y. atmosphere prevailed at home: Her family ""was always making things,"" she said. Ms. Lucas's father, a milkman, could build cabinets. Her mother, who would later oversee art programs in primary schools, had a plot in a community garden, where she grew vegetables. She made clothes as well as toys, including stuffed animals (Ms. Lucas's introduction to fluff) and taught her daughter the basics of gardening, sewing and cooking. Ms. Lucas was, in her own words, ""a shy, reserved kid"" who read voraciously and seems to have gradually discovered her own gregariousness. ""In my early teens, I found my feet with it and learned to banter,"" she said. ""It was a great joy."" The love of banter is reflected in her fondness for collaborating with other artists and her preference for enlisting friends to help make work. Yet one of the most resonant things she said during our talks was: ""Making things is company. Like reading or cooking.""

It doesn't take long to get the joke: We're seeing their primary sexual characteristics, and they're ready for action. You can apprehend the couple as clearly as you might two figures in an early work by Edward Kienholz; they seem similarly seedy, given the stained yellowish mattress. Nonetheless, the still life of fruit and bucket remains equally present. As usual, Ms. Lucas makes every texture, color and shape count; the ensemble put me in mind of the lightness and delicacy of a painting by Watteau. The piece is caustic, yet joyful about the persistence of desire and connection. The main arc of the New Museum show, on view through Jan. 20, is from early assemblages like ""Au Naturel"" to the distinctive 2010 ""Penetralia"" series, made with Mr. Simmons, which involves pieces of wood and rock found around their Suffolk house. My favorite is ""Tree Nob 2,"" in which an expressively sculpted white plaster phallus rises like a mushroom from a small chunk of wood. From the Biennale, there are several plaster casts of the lower bodies of the artist and nine girlfriends, which they made together. Lolling about on tables and chairs, with cigarettes protruding from unlikely places, they resemble impertinent secretaries or artists' models relaxing for a moment, casting shade on the male artists for whom they are posing. At least those are two possibilities. In total, this trajectory shows an artist becoming much more of a sculptor or form maker, veering between the found and invented in new ways that imply that the avant-garde might still exist.","Not widely known on this side of the Atlantic, the British sculptor has a show at the New Museum this fall that may cause jaws to drop.",4e4761ca-5ced-5ea7-b191-f64faadbb3e6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/arts/16lucas1/16lucas1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c19bac36b74360ae31b70ea5681b81900c20185cd6290bed909d707a9afbf922&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artist Sarah Lucas at her London home.

Your Money,Obama Orders Creation of 'MyRA' Savings Accounts,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/30/your-money/obama-orders-creation-of-myRA-accounts.html,"Making good on a State of the Union address promise, President Obama on Wednesday ordered the creation of new employer-sponsored savings accounts intended to help more people get started saving for retirement. The plan, announced on Tuesday night, was in keeping with his theme of providing financial relief to the middle class to try to bridge what is widely acknowledged as a growing income equality gap. The president also vowed to raise the minimum wage for employees of federal contractors in hopes of spurring other companies to do the same. In a stop in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Mr. Obama signed a presidential memorandum and handed it to Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. It instructed him to create the new ""starter"" retirement savings program called ""myRA,"" a name intended to mimic the I.R.A.'s, or individual retirement accounts, that were first made available to workers in the mid-1970s.

The accounts -- which are intended for people who do not now have employer-sponsored savings plans -- will operate much like Roth I.R.A.'s, according to Treasury officials. Married couples with modified adjusted gross incomes up to $191,000 and individuals earning up to $129,000 will be able to save up to $15,000 total in after-tax dollars for a maximum of 30 years. In contrast, Roth I.R.A.'s generally allow employees to save up to $5,500 annually, or $6,500 if they are over age 50, in 2014. MyRA contributions can be withdrawn tax-free at any time without penalty, though pulling out any earnings will be subject to the same restrictions as the Roth, according to Treasury officials. Initial investments can be as low as $25, and contributions as little as $5 can be made through payroll deductions; mutual funds often have much higher investment minimums. There will be only one investment option: The Treasury will create a security fund modeled after the federal employees' Thrift Savings Plan Government Securities Investment Fund, which pays a variable rate.

For the year that ended in December 2012, it had an average annual return of 1.74 percent. It posted an average annual return of 2.69 percent for the five years that ended in December 2012. There are no fees, the Treasury said. Unlike the popular 401(k) plans now available to millions of employees at larger companies, account holders cannot lose money. Still, workers also will not have the benefit of potentially higher returns when investing in a diversified portfolio of stocks and bond funds. But the Treasury's goal is to get people saving, particularly lower-income workers, who otherwise might not save at all. ""While this will not solve the retirement income shortfall that exists in the U.S., it is a step in the right direction,"" said Jamie Hopkins, a professor in the retirement income program at the American College. ""These new accounts will open up access to tax-advantaged retirement savings vehicles that many people do not currently have access to because of cost-prohibitive barriers."" As he pointed out, the maximum workers can save, $15,000, is very limited. ""This is relatively small and for most people won't make a significant impact on their retirement preparedness all by itself,"" he said. Savers can keep the same account when they change jobs. Once a saver's myRA reaches $15,000, or after 30 years, the balance will be rolled over to a private sector retirement account. Account holders also have the option of rolling it over earlier. The new accounts will initially be offered through a pilot program by employers who choose to participate by the end of this year. The accounts are meant to cost employers little or nothing to create since they will neither administer the accounts nor contribute to them. But employers are not required to offer them. In his speech on Tuesday, the president addressed what many people consider a crisis among retirees who are living longer on smaller and smaller pots of money: ""Today, most workers don't have a pension. A Social Security check often isn't enough on its own. And while the stock market has doubled over the last five years, that doesn't help folks who don't have 401(k)'s.""","The accounts, which are intended for people who do not now have employer-sponsored savings plans, will operate much like Roth I.R.A.'s, according to Treasury officials.",ce49ee53-61b8-5787-8ec3-351c48416463,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/30/business/Retirement/Retirement-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=349&w=600&s=137357b5b171bdf140adaf1a8b1abe5725afb0c81b10d3669e0a4fb16ae91c86&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"President Obama announced a plan for ""starter"" retirement savings accounts on Tuesday in his State of the Union address.",ce49ee53-61b8-5787-8ec3-351c48416463,N24News/imgs/ce49ee53-61b8-5787-8ec3-351c48416463.jpg,21
Theater,He's Playing Rupert Murdoch as More Than a 'Pantomime Villain',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/11/theater/bertie-carvel-ink-james-graham.html,"""He's a young man with an enormous appetite,"" said Bertie Carvel, photographed at Rules restaurant, of his portrayal of Rupert Murdoch in ""Ink.""

LONDON -- Rules, this city's oldest restaurant, sits in the center of the West End: a discreet dining spot and a British institution dating back to 1798. Its decor is eccentrically English: oak panels, frilled lampshades, walls dotted with political cartoons and animal horns. The doormen wear fur collars and top hats. Waiters swish silver sweepers over the crisp white tablecloths. It was here, in this onetime oyster bar, that Rupert Murdoch appointed Larry Lamb editor of his first British newspaper, a two-bit tabloid called The Sun, back in 1968. That meeting opens James Graham's play ""Ink,"" the prolific British playwright's latest attempt to unpack Britain's postwar history. ""Ink"" tracks The Sun's rise to become Britain's best-selling daily paper and the beginnings of Mr. Murdoch's media empire that would, at its height, include Fox News and The New York Post. During a recent lunchtime sitting, Bertie Carvel sat in one of Rules' red velvet booths surveying the scene. ""It is so redolent of the English establishment,"" the actor said, scanning a menu for the meal he eats night after night onstage as Mr. Murdoch: a glass of Chianti and a fillet steak. ""Rare,"" he instructed the hovering waiter. ""He's a young man with an enormous appetite,"" Mr. Carvel offered, as if to rectify the image of Mr. Murdoch today, aged 88. ""He eats his steak so rare it's bloody.""

In ""Ink,"" which after an acclaimed run here is about to open on Broadway, you get the measure of Mr. Murdoch at mealtimes rather than in office hours. Mr. Carvel has him break every bit of table etiquette imaginable, tucking his napkin into his collar and talking as he chews. He guzzles wine, jabs his knife to gesticulate, then, exactingly, flicks a fleck of food off the tablecloth. Rules, in Mr. Carvel's estimation, was a place to rub others' noses in it. ""As a blue-blooded Australian from a wealthy family, Oxford-educated, he both revered and reviled the British establishment,"" Mr. Carvel said of Mr. Murdoch. ""He's a disrupter. His belief that rules are there to be broken is analogous with other, modern-day disrupters."" By that, Mr. Carvel meant -- among others -- President Trump, whose ear Mr. Murdoch is widely reported to have. The Sun sold so well because, relaunched under Mr. Lamb's stewardship, it appealed to base popular tastes, lowering the tone of the Fleet Street press with sensationalist stories and photographs of topless models splashed on Page Three.

For Mr. Carvel, the resonance is clear. ""It's a play about populism,"" he said, taking a sip of his Chianti. ""It's about what happens when you give people what they want. What happens when you court success in a certain way? What happens when you let the genie out of the bottle?""

In plays like ""This House"" and ""Labour of Love,"" Mr. Graham has focused on parliamentary politics. ""Ink"" widens the lens, scrutinizing the media landscape that holds so much sway. Yet The Sun is still deemed, by some, a stain on British life, and Mr. Murdoch looms large in the public imagination. ""He's a sort of pantomime villain,"" Mr. Carvel explained. It takes a certain kind of actor to embody that onstage, and it's telling that Mr. Carvel, a shape-shifter with a showman's instincts, is the only member of the original British cast crossing the Atlantic with Rupert Goold's production, which Manhattan Theater Club is presenting at the Samuel J. Friedman Theater. It brings the 41-year-old Londoner back to New York six years after his Tony Award nomination for his turn as Miss Trunchbull, the imposing headmistress (and ex-Olympian hammer thrower) who towered over ""Matilda the Musical."" The ""Matilda"" director Matthew Warchus has described him as an old-school ""nose putty actor,"" referring to his relish for physical transformation. Mr. Carvel was, indeed, unrecognizable in the role. Buckled into a brown dress, hair wrenched into a bun, his ""Trunch"" was shrill-voiced, broad-shouldered and twinkle-toed. Though he had led National Theater and Royal Court productions in London, ""Matilda"" cemented Mr. Carvel's reputation as a singular, chameleonic performer. He has since been selective in choosing roles, ensuring each presented a fresh challenge. He was banshee-like in the Almeida's ""Bakkhai,"" then a shaven-headed hulk in ""The Hairy Ape"" for the Old Vic. Onscreen, he's played eccentric wizards and suburban adulterers. Every part is idiosyncratic, completely original. Serious, symmetrical and athletic under his black turtleneck, Mr. Carvel is a character actor with leading-man looks. As a teenager growing up in Hampstead, North London, he was a keen cosplayer, creating Dungeons and Dragons-style personas.

""I took great pride in having thousands of different characters,"" he said, slicing into his steak. His flights of fancy offered an escape from his everyday (one ex-girlfriend gave him a mug embossed with the word ""Dreamer"") and he admits to still feeling self-conscious today, more at ease when at play than in his own skin.

""I'm able to live parts of myself I otherwise can't,"" he said. ""It's not a disguise. I love getting into all these different corners of myself. I can be a prince, a princess, a pauper. There are a multitude of possible beings inside you."" In an interview, Mr. Warchus stressed the ""braininess"" of Mr. Carvel's approach. ""He has this hunger to turn everything into a study of human nature and its extremities,"" the director explained. ""It's a paradox. He uses his head to find the heat -- the passions and the pain of his characters -- but he's tamed his head enough to play."" That rigor might also reflect his family origins. Mr. Carvel comes from a long line of newshounds -- another reason he was so right for ""Ink."" His great-grandfather wrote for The Star; his grandfather, for the Evening Standard; and he retains a ""visceral"" childhood memory of The Guardian newsroom where his father, John, worked for 36 years. ""Desks piled high with papers and phones and all sorts of mess,"" Mr. Carvel recalled. The play's set design brought it all rushing back: ""I love the smell of newsprint,"" he said. Mr. Carvel might have followed a more creative path, but he sees an overlap between his storytelling and his father's: ""Imagination and truth, that's not a dichotomy for me."" His process is part psychology, part journalism: rooted in research, but free to empathize.","Bertie Carvel, the son and grandson of journalists, aims to complicate the media mogul he portrays in ""Ink.""",a9c2c06c-1877-56e5-a9b2-686e43515532,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/arts/14CARVEL1/14CARVEL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=91ac261fd0897478772839a65a469e17ba6becce7fb721c2cb9d079c3b078865&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;He&rsquo;s a young man with an enormous appetite,&rdquo; said Bertie Carvel, photographed at Rules restaurant, of his portrayal of Rupert Murdoch in &ldquo;Ink.&rdquo;",a9c2c06c-1877-56e5-a9b2-686e43515532,N24News/imgs/a9c2c06c-1877-56e5-a9b2-686e43515532.jpg,10
Television,Now Playing Nightly on Instagram: Sketch Comedy's Newest Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/arts/television/instagram-live-comedy-virus.html,"Everyone in comedy is now either an internet star or an aspiring one.

More so than any other artists, comics adjusted quickly to the new normal, with theaters reinventing themselves as online portals, clubs producing virtual stand-up sets and just about everyone performing on Instagram Live. Jim Gaffigan put his family dinners on YouTube, and Mike Birbiglia live-streamed the development of new jokes with Maria Bamford and John Mulaney. In one of the best pivots, Sam Morril and Taylor Tomlinson, who both recently released stand-up specials, started shooting quick funny videos chronicling a new couple cooped up together in quarantine, and it has grown into a very funny series.

But the comedians doing the most assured work online didn't need to adjust because they were already there, particularly those in the growing genre of ""front-facing camera comedy"": short character sketches played directly to the camera. Owing a debt to the hectic editing of Tim and Eric and the influence of the defunct six-second-or-less platform Vine, these videos have gone viral for years, but with comedians and audiences stuck at home, they have replaced the special as the dominant comedy form of the Covid-19 crisis. In the constantly shifting ecosystem of young performers on Twitter and Instagram, the most vital voice to emerge during this anxious, isolating moment is that of Meg Stalter.

Stalter, 29, has become essential escapist entertainment, an oasis of invigorating silliness in feeds dominated by wearying tragedy. Part of the reason is her staggering productivity. In the last two weeks alone, she started a new podcast, ""Confronting Demons,"" and performed nearly nightly hours on IG Live, including comic versions of a cooking show, a magic show, a motivational seminar and a master class on the art of seduction. She has also produced more than a dozen flamboyant new characters, from Cameile Orgasm, the self-described richest person in Beverly Hills, to your aunt who just realized she should be in quarantine -- along with a bunch of random experiments like recreating a segment from ""Sex and the City"" and narrating a scene from a Marilyn Monroe movie.

While live in-person comedy has vanished, the Meg Stalter Industrial Complex has filled the vacuum. And though producing such a titanic volume of material from her Brooklyn apartment will inevitably produce uneven results, there is an aesthetic through-line to her comedy, such a signature style that you see online comments refer to people as a Meg Stalter character. So who exactly is that?","Names big and small are pivoting to online humor, but the standouts are the character-driven performers who were there all along, especially Meg Stalter.",0861a5f4-bd77-5067-b1b6-98e7b2a84637,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/29/arts/29digital-comedy1/merlin_171036771_9c414cbd-653d-4be6-8918-606e91a4666d-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4ec1ab7cfb4b6e945abba296dbc0c29372fc65b5c17584c36325de84d80953c9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Stalter as Cameile Orgasm, ""the richest person in Beverly Hills.""",0861a5f4-bd77-5067-b1b6-98e7b2a84637,N24News/imgs/0861a5f4-bd77-5067-b1b6-98e7b2a84637.jpg,3
Technology,Lyft to Bring Driverless Car Tech to Broader Auto Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/14/technology/lyft-magna-driverless-cars.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- The ride-hailing service Lyft has agreed to alliances with just about anyone working on driverless car technology. Its latest partnership aims to make its autonomous vehicle technology available to any car manufacturer. Lyft said Wednesday that it had reached a deal with Magna International, one of the world's biggest auto suppliers, to jointly develop and manufacture self-driving car systems. The companies said they will work together to introduce autonomous vehicles to Lyft's ride-hailing network. At the same time, Magna can sell the driverless-car technology to any customer -- including other technology companies. Magna also said it would invest $200 million in Lyft's latest fund-raising round, lifting the San Francisco-based company's valuation to $11.7 billion.

Lyft has opened its ride-hailing network to other companies working on self-driving cars, including Ford and General Motors, a major Lyft investor, so they can gain real-world experience by picking up passengers and collecting data. Uber, Lyft's main rival, has been developing self-driving technology mostly on its own. Waymo, a Lyft partner, is slowly introducing its own ride-hailing service using autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans equipped with Waymo's own hardware and software. The hype over self-driving cars has made development of the technology challenging for some traditional automakers. Car companies face huge salaries for top artificial intelligence engineers and limited access to data and key components. The competitive landscape is so charged that it has already given birth to at least one high-profile lawsuit. As a result, automakers are confronting a choice: Pay big for a technology start-up or risk falling behind. Last year, Ford announced it would invest $1 billion in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up focused on developing autonomous vehicle technology. GM acquired Cruise for an estimated $1 billion in cash, stock and incentive packages in 2016, the same year it invested $500 million in Lyft.

It also has a major asset for self-driving technology -- a ride-hailing network picking up and dropping off passengers 10 million times a week. This provides Lyft with a customer base to introduce and test the vehicles and a way to collect information that can be used to ""train"" autonomous cars. But Raj Kapoor, Lyft's chief strategy officer, said it would be a few years before truly autonomous vehicles were ready for the road. ""I believe this relationship will get us there faster,"" Mr. Kapoor said. Magna, a Canadian auto parts maker, already supplies a wide range of driver-assist technology to its customers, including a system for staying in lanes, automatic emergency braking and rearview cameras. It also builds entire vehicles for customers like Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar -- a capability that has made the company a potential partner for a new entrant like Apple. Magna has already been working on hardware for self-driving cars, including radar and lidar -- an abbreviation for light detection and ranging -- that help the vehicles see the world around them. But Magna said the partnership with Lyft would be essential to helping it push further into autonomous vehicles, combining its automotive and manufacturing experience with Lyft's ride network to better understand the many situations that a self-driving car will encounter. ""The question isn't whether autonomous vehicles are going to happen but how long the transition is,"" said Swamy Kotagiri, Magna's chief technology officer.","The ride-hailing company is teaming up with Magna, a major auto supplier, to jointly develop self-driving car systems. It's the latest in a series of alliances made by Lyft.",c4617eaa-09ac-5671-b578-4f3a0011010c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/15/business/15LYFT01/15LYFT01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2929de5d702514686ce6910ec35a0a20db5d9c576fa2d3930cc7e46c28e41628&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Lyft driver hub in San Francisco.

Art & Design,A Public Art Campaign Will Commission Political Billboards Across the Country,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/03/arts/design/public-art-campaign-political-billboards.html,"This fall, thousands of billboard and lawn signs will be erected all over the country in advance of the midterms, bearing names of politicians up for election. But a new campaign by the organization For Freedoms aims to use those tools not to promote specific candidates but to galvanize debate and political participation through art. The organization has enlisted artists like Sam Durant, Theaster Gates and Marilyn Minter to create public artwork and lead town halls as part of a $1.5 million-dollar campaign.

""We are hoping to bring art to the center of public life in the lead-up to the midterms, which is where we think art should belong,"" Eric Gottesman, one of the organization's founders, said in a phone interview.

A central aspect of the effort, called the 50 State Initiative, will be a fund-raising campaign to put up billboards across the country starting in September. Fifty-two Kickstarter campaigns will seek to raise $3,000 per state plus Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. Dozens of artists, including the three mentioned above as well as Tania Bruguera, Trevor Paglen and Carrie Mae Weems, will contribute billboards. Mr. Paglen's work, for example, will focus on the ethics of data collection; Ms. Bruguera will work with the Rhode Island School of Design to create a billboard there.

For Freedoms has also enlisted over 200 local partners -- from museums to universities to galleries -- to collaborate on free public programming. The Fralin Museum of Art, for example, will use public dialogues and art-making sessions to educate Charlottesville, Va., residents about the history of slavery and discrimination in that city. And the Telfair Museums in Georgia will host a community day, with the exhibiting artists Erin Johnson and Ken Ueno leading tours of their work. More than 175 artists, including Nina Chanel Abney and Emma Sulkowicz, will participate in various ways across the country.","Artists including Sam Durant, Theaster Gates and Marilyn Minter will create billboards to be put up in advance of the midterms.",72cedb26-f99b-5649-b08d-b4670ca464f8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/04/arts/design/04forfreedoms-item1/04forfreedoms-item1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bcfab4dc62ac7cb7a50002a7eccb082e97d480b31bf460ecb370c40369e52fa7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Grab 'Em by the Ballots,"" a billboard created by Zoë Buckman and For Freedoms in Harrisburg, Pa., in 2016.",72cedb26-f99b-5649-b08d-b4670ca464f8,N24News/imgs/72cedb26-f99b-5649-b08d-b4670ca464f8.jpg,14
Dance,"All That Craft, and Now Some Abandon",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/12/arts/dance/michele-wiless-ballet-next-at-new-york-live-arts.html,"Almost three years ago, Michele Wiles performed her final ""Swan Lake"" with American Ballet Theater. She kept the occasion so private that her partner didn't even realize what was going on. Driven by an urge to experience ballet in a new way, Ms. Wiles didn't so much retire from the company as slip away. ""I wanted a challenge,"" she said in an interview. ""I wanted to feel passionate and expressive. I wanted people to feel me when I performed, and I think, to get there, I needed to give up the safety. I needed to be uncomfortable. For me, it had to be that extreme."" During her 14 years at Ballet Theater, Ms. Wiles, now 33 and the artistic director of her own company, Ballet Next, felt herself changing, personally and emotionally. ""Moving away to a classical ballet school when you're a child is kind of nutty,"" she said. ""I was 10. It was a straight shot to the American Ballet Theater. It was Studio Company, apprenticeship, corps, soloist, principal.""

With Ballet Next, a company formed with Charles Askegard (who has since become the associate artistic director of Minnesota Dance Theater), Ms. Wiles can explore all she likes. For the troupe's season at New York Live Arts starting Tuesday, she has initiated a collaboration with Brian Reeder, who has choreographed the evening's three works, including two premieres and ""Picnic,"" a reworking of his 2012 piece for the company inspired by the 1975 film ""Picnic at Hanging Rock."" Among ballet dancers today, soul searching is hardly unusual. Just as international stars bounce among companies, others, like Wendy Whelan and Alessandra Ferri, are taking on modern dance. Craig Salstein of Ballet Theater and Troy Schumacher of New York City Ballet have formed their own intimate companies. ""There is a change happening in the dance world that we haven't experienced in a long time,"" Ms. Wiles said. ""It's like we're all being awakened to something else."" Mr. Reeder, an independent choreographer, said it used to be that when a dancer started to feel stagnant in a company, it was time to pay a visit ""to Career Transition for Dancers and be a candy-stripe nurse or a dental assistant."" He continued: ""I think with more and more people, there's a bohemian spirit of saying: 'Don't put me in a box. I still want to dance.' ""

But Ms. Wiles is different from others: She's in her prime. ""A lot of people were saying, 'You need to get into another company,' "" she said, laughing. ""But I love that I've taken responsibility to do this. I'm taking ownership of what happens next with my work."" When Ms. Wiles talks about Ballet Next, she speaks about building a platform, not just for herself but for other dancers, choreographers, musicians and artists. ""That feels right to me,"" she said. ""I need that, even though it is a struggle. The most challenging part for me is balancing everything: still maintaining my dancing, but also developing the business. I'm developing relationships. I think I had to learn how to trust and let people in and have things work out and have things not work out."" One success has been Ms. Wiles's continuing relationship with Mr. Reeder, who danced at City Ballet and William Forsythe's Ballet Frankfurt before finishing his career at Ballet Theater. ""He has so much experience,"" she said. ""He's so smart. I love that intelligence in the work. It's not some grand avant-garde thing. It's subtle and tasteful, and I feel like that's what I want this to be."" Along with ""Picnic,"" an ominous ballet about several young women who disappear one summer afternoon, two others highlight Mr. Reeder's inventiveness with constructing a labyrinth of steps, or what he called, ""dance for the sake of dance."" Ms. Wiles and David Hallberg in a 2009 production of ""Swan Lake."" In ""Different Homes,"" a duet for Ms. Wiles and Jens Weber, the task is that the dancers never press their palms together. ""Surmisable Units,"" a full-company piece set to Steve Reich, shows off Mr. Reeder's deft command of how to instill ballet vocabulary -- not a mishmash of gestures -- with contemporary drive. In its powerful opening solo, Ms. Wiles shows how she's developed since leaving Ballet Theater: The technical assuredness remains, but there's also an air of abandon.

""You never walk out of a Brian Reeder rehearsal feeling stifled or pressured,"" she continued. ""I always leave feeling free. I think it's in the way that he trusts the dancers and allows them to explore. Brian is a big-picture thinker."" Ms. Wiles, her long blond hair streaming down her back, exudes a quiet sense of calm. She isn't a bossy boss, but, as Mr. Reeder noted, she knows what she's willing to take a chance on. ""I don't think I'm one of those, 'Do this!' "" she said. ""But you have to make decisions. Sometimes I don't realize the position I'm in, and I see the dancers looking at me. I'm like: You know what? I remember that from being in the company. If I see them spazzing out, I'll talk to them. You can do that when the company's smaller. But I don't know. I think maybe you can do that with a big company, too, especially with the team that you have behind you. That's so important: having the right team."" Counting Ms. Wiles, Ballet Next features seven handpicked dancers, with varying levels of experience, including the lovely Kaitlyn Gilliland, a former City Ballet member. ""Obviously, I'd like for it to increase, but do I want it to be huge?"" Ms. Wiles asked. ""Not right now. I want it to be a company with high-quality work, where everyone is taken care of. Eight to 10 dancers. Brian choreographing. Definitely live music. Minimalist, but tasteful."" Her eyes sparkled. ""A jewel of a company.""","Michele Wiles, a former principal with American Ballet Theater, says she's given up safety by leading her own company, Ballet Next.",a9b406fa-37e6-5439-aed6-956e928beb89,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/12/arts/12WILES1_SPAN/12WILES1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=4820e81bb7573f3234927c135181831ddb2d002c2ac74f4a9d3ee82e3977740a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Michele Wiles, a dancer and artistic director of Ballet Next.",a9b406fa-37e6-5439-aed6-956e928beb89,N24News/imgs/a9b406fa-37e6-5439-aed6-956e928beb89.jpg,6
Opinion,"'Never Trump' Republicans Will Support Biden, Not Sanders",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/09/opinion/joe-biden-never-trump.html,"As more data emerge to explain former Vice President Joe Biden's stunning victory on Super Tuesday, there are two clear demographics that propelled him: African-American voters and suburban voters with college degrees.

It's a coalition that helped moderate Democrats flip seven governorships, two Senate seats and about 40 House districts (the newly Democratic suburbs alone would have secured a House majority) from red to blue in 2018. African-Americans have long made up a core of the Democratic voting base, but many of Mr. Biden's college-educated, suburban supporters are right-leaning independents or moderate Republicans who supported candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney. They don't want to re-elect Donald Trump. And they're willing to cross over to vote for a Democrat -- a moderate and mainstream Democrat.

These voters might not identify with the ""Never Trump"" group of conservatives who vociferously oppose the president. But in practice, that's who they are. They often voted for Republicans in the past and are now firmly anti-Trump. These voters can create winning margins for Democrats in swing states like Michigan, Pennsylvania, Arizona and North Carolina in the general election.

Their numerical strength was on full display on Super Tuesday in the Virginia and Texas suburbs, which saw 74 percent and 87 percent higher voter turnout, respectively, than four years ago. These de facto Never Trumpers also showed up in large quantities in the suburbs of Charleston, S.C., where 58 percent more people voted in the Democratic primary last Tuesday compared with 2016. And they pulled the lever overwhelmingly for Joe Biden. In Iowa last month, while Democratic turnout was down from 2016 throughout the rest of the state, it spiked 38 percent in Dallas County -- the far suburbs of Des Moines that had been stalwart Republican country not long ago.",Right-of-center voters are open to voting for a moderate Democrat. They have been helping one in the primaries.,7ad3d1e4-75e2-5695-844b-645578ba1529,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/10/opinion/10Longwell/10Longwell-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3764767529b1ab2045704424fc021e403e325a18d460802d632ae6d39b14110e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Biden supporters during a campaign rally in St. Louis, Mo., on Saturday.",7ad3d1e4-75e2-5695-844b-645578ba1529,N24News/imgs/7ad3d1e4-75e2-5695-844b-645578ba1529.jpg,11
Real Estate,New York's New High-End Rentals,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/07/realestate/new-yorks-new-high-end-rentals.html,"A slew of high-end, high-profile rental buildings are poised to open across Manhattan and Brooklyn this year, adding more than 8,000 units at a pace not seen in years, and in the process, redefining what rental housing in the city can be. Many of these new rental buildings are large, tall and unusually shaped. Some are in untested residential areas, which might explain their devotion to lavishly entertaining their occupants by piling on the amenities both indoors and out. Soon-to-be-completed examples include Via 57West, on an industrial edge of Manhattan's West Side; 461 Dean Street, by the Barclays Center at the Vanderbilt Yards in Brooklyn; and 365 Bond Street, on the banks of the Gowanus Canal. Prices, too, are lofty, with studios in some of the buildings renting for about $5,000 a month. While any softness in the rental market -- new leasing activity has slowed in recent months, and vacancies are up -- could spell challenges going forward, most developers say they are undeterred.

""New York is safer and cleaner than it's been in decades, and we fully expect people to keep moving here,"" said Adam R. Rose, a president of Rose Associates, which is converting 70 Pine Street, an Art Deco office building in the financial district, into a 776-unit rental. ""And the fact is, we need virtually unlimited housing at all levels,"" he added. Once, a driveway and porte-cochere might have been enough to provide a building with an air of prestige, but rentals today seem to be springing for brash top-to-bottom designs. Like their condo kin, rentals are increasingly opting for architects with boldface names. Via 57West, a 709-unit rental at 625 West 57th Street, for example, was designed by the Bjarke Ingels Group. Mr. Ingels is the Danish designer whose resume also includes Two World Trade Center.

Because the metal-paneled rental is near the West Side Highway, a gateway to Manhattan, the city's Planning Commission didn't want some humdrum rectangle, according to Durst officials. But Mr. Ingels' great pyramid also allowed Durst to preserve Hudson River views from the windows of the Helena, a rental that the company owns next door, according to a Durst spokesman. The offbeat style produced unusual layouts. A 685-square-foot one-bedroom with tall windows that was a stop on a recent tour had an angled exterior wall, which might not be ideal for straight-backed furniture. ""We have apartments with a lot of character to them,"" said Jonathan Drescher, a Durst senior vice president. And those apartments seem tailored to younger, unattached renters, as 85 percent are studios, starting at $2,770 a month, or one-bedrooms, starting at $3,880. In contrast, the median price of a studio in Manhattan in December was $2,562 a month, while that of a one-bedroom was $3,375, according to a market report from Douglas Elliman Real Estate. Via and other buildings are adding rental units to the market in a banner development year. About 4,900 apartments in large and mostly market-rate buildings are expected to open their doors in Manhattan in 2016, according to data prepared for The New York Times by Cliff Finn, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing, and George Wlodarczyk, a research director there. This is a significant increase, as the number has hovered below 3,000 a year since at least 2010. Eight of the 15 major buildings to open this year, according to Elliman, offer 300 apartments or more. Similarly, Brooklyn will add about 3,300 apartments in major projects in 2016, Elliman said, the most since 2014, when about 3,000 units entered the market. But in previous years, going back to 2007, the number of new apartments that opened in the borough was much lower.

In addition, the city has more empty apartments than usual. Traditionally, in New York, the dividing line between a robust and not-so-great market is a 2 percent vacancy rate. Since June of last year, the rate has been higher, with November's at 2.87 percent, the highest in nine years, Mr. Miller said. In December, the rate was 2.74 percent. With empty apartments and dipping rents, the market is not ideally suited for thousands of new units, which could depress prices further. For renters, that could be a good thing. Mr. Miller said concessions are already part of the picture. Both Via 57West and 70 Pine are offering two free months on a 14-month lease, which is more than the one month traditionally offered under similar conditions, Mr. Miller said. ""I think there is great confusion about demand for this product,"" Mr. Miller added. ""It's not correct to say that demand is not there for this new product. It is more accurate to say that in many, if not most, cases, demand is not there at prices set a few years ago."" Of course, developers won't really know where things stand until their rental offices actually open. But so far, many of the rentals scheduled to hit the market in the next few months come with high monthly price tags.

The new 11-story, 106-unit rental from the Related Companies at 456 Washington Street in TriBeCa, for instance, will have studios starting at $4,995 a month, while one-bedrooms will start at $5,295, though a Related spokeswoman pointed out that the building, which is to open in May, is in a prime location, and that its apartments are larger than most of the firm's other properties. Studios are around 600 square feet, she said, while one-bedrooms range from 700 to 750 square feet. Also in May, Related will unveil the Easton, a 230-unit rental on East 92nd Street, where one-bedrooms will start at $4,295 a month. If rents seem steep, they need to be considered along with the costs of building apartment houses, which can be astronomical, according to Jed Walentas, a principal of Two Trees Management Company, which is developing 300 Ashland Place, a 379-unit tower across from the Brooklyn Academy of Music in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, to open at summer's end. The building, clad in aluminum-composite panels, was designed by TEN Arquitectos, Enrique Norten's firm. From above, the building resembles a flattened football with its pointed ends trimmed, creating slightly curving walls. It was built under the 421-a program, which gives developers breaks on their property taxes if they construct and maintain affordable housing in a so-called 80-20 building -- 80 percent market-rate rents and 20 percent below-market or affordable rents. Developers say that in a city where land is so pricey, it can be almost impossible to build without the program, especially rentals, for which revenue trickles in over time. The controversial benefit, which critics say enriches developers at the expense of the public and has outlived its usefulness, expired in January, and its impending end helped fuel the current rental-building boom, some developers say.

At 300 Ashland Place, 421-a has made a big difference. The $170 million project will realize savings of up to $2 million a year in property taxes for 25 years, or about $50 million, according to Two Trees officials, in exchange for the building's 76 below-market-rate apartments. As Mr. Walentas scanned the horizon from his rising tower, which provides views of low-slung sections of Brooklyn that were mostly unattainable before the rental boom, he said he wasn't worried about competition. ""The more people build, the better it's going to be for everybody,"" he said, adding that the rising buildings help strengthen neighborhoods. One new rental in the current crop, 461 Dean Street in Brooklyn, will be split almost evenly between apartments with below-market rents and market-rate apartments.
* None
* Testing the Limits: Only three of New York's 25 tallest residential buildings have completed safety tasks required by the city.
* The Downside to Life in a Supertall: 432 Park faces some significant design problems, and other luxury high-rises may share its fate.
* Luxury Developers' Loophole: Soaring towers are able to push high into the sky because of a loophole in the city's labyrinthine zoning laws.
* An Evolving Skyline: The high-rise building boom has transformed the city's skyline in recent years. Its impact will echo for years to come.
* Hidden Feats: Our critic looks at some supertall N.Y.C. buildings and how the ingenuity of engineers helped build landmarks. The 363-unit project from Forest City Ratner Companies, which is made of prefabricated modules, will have 181 apartments with lower rents. About 40 percent of the affordable units, or 72, will be for people making 100 percent to 160 percent of the area's median income, or up to $138,080 for a family of four. That family could end up paying $2,800 a month for a two-bedroom, said Susi Yu, an executive vice president of Forest City. ""This is actually a segment of the market that really has been overlooked,"" Ms. Yu said, referring to the income bracket of that same family of four.

When the lottery is announced, which is expected ""imminently,"" according to a project spokeswoman, applicants will have 60 days to register at the New York City Housing Connect web page, or by paper application. To get the word out about the application process, Forest City will contact labor unions, community boards and churches. Each applicant will receive a number. If that number is drawn, he or she must submit tax returns, landlord references and bank statements to verify eligibility. Priority will be given to people with visual impairments and other disabilities, and secondarily, to those who live within the boundaries of Brooklyn Community Boards 2, 3, 6 and 8. Municipal workers also will have an advantage. As has been the case for several years, buildings in less-residential neighborhoods are packed with extras designed to give their occupants something to do in otherwise quiet areas. But the amount of space dedicated to these amenities has mushroomed. At Via by the West Side Highway, for instance, the 30,000 square feet of indoor amenity space will include a 75-foot swimming pool, a half basketball court and a leather-walled room designated for poker. A terraced courtyard planted with pitch pines, river birches and honey locusts will offer another 22,000 square feet of communal space. Four retail spaces will line the building's base.

But in a shift, even developers in more central areas are acknowledging a new cultural reality: that young renters, who may work and live under the same roof, and have all their groceries delivered, might not set foot outside that much. At amenity-loaded 70 Pine, ""the whole idea is that you don't ever have to leave the building,"" Mr. Rose said. Rents for studios on the lower floors of the 1932 building, which are now being marketed, start at $3,100 a month, and 21 leases were signed between December and the end of January. The next batch of studios, on higher floors, will inch up to $3,200 a month, Mr. Rose said. The building has about 19,000 square feet of amenities, spread across two below-grade levels, including a two-lane bowling alley and a 20-seat screening room in an old bank vault, whose door will be welded into the open position. Seventy Pine's fitness center will be run by La Palestra, a company whose services extend to arranging out-of-building exercise at places like Mount Kilimanjaro. There will be about 31,500 square feet of retail space, including a branch of the upscale grocer Urban Market. And the top four levels of the building, which has a window-lined observation deck, will house a yet-to-be named restaurant from the team behind the Spotted Pig in the West Village. The list of amenities dazzles even Mr. Rose. ""I've been in this business for 30 years, and we've never done this much in one place before,"" he said.","A slew of high-end, high-profile rental buildings are poised to open across Manhattan and Brooklyn this year, adding units at a pace not seen in years.",44111465-2548-5053-afe1-b7873150d69d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/07/realestate/07COV2/07COV2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=f85da501cf4cdcfb379317c8e57f422c3e34aa7fc7efe61da72dd6d92b8346e7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New rental buildings in New York include 461 Dean Street, rising behind the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.",44111465-2548-5053-afe1-b7873150d69d,N24News/imgs/44111465-2548-5053-afe1-b7873150d69d.jpg,7
Health,Should You Keep Taking Zantac for Your Heartburn?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/19/health/zantac-recall.html,"This article was updated on Sept. 20 to reflect actions taken by other countries. The heartburn drug Zantac has been on the market for decades, and was considered safe enough to be sold over the counter and regularly given to infants. But on Sept. 13, the Food and Drug Administration said that it had detected low levels of a cancer-causing chemical in samples of the drug, which is also known as ranitidine. The agency advised patients who were taking over-the-counter versions of Zantac to consider switching to other medications. On Sept. 18, the drug maker Novartis said that its generic-drug division, Sandoz, had stopped distributing a prescription form of ranitidine worldwide as it investigates the issue. Another major generic manufacturer, Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, also said it was halting distribution. The companies, including Sanofi, which manufactures the brand-name version, have stopped short of recalling their products in the United States.

What is the problem? The F.D.A. said that it had detected a type of nitrosamine called N-nitrosodimethylamine, or NDMA, in all of the samples that it tested. NDMA is the same chemical that was found in some versions of valsartan, a blood-pressure drug carrying the brand name Diovan. The discovery of NDMA in valsartan led to several recalls of that commonly prescribed drug, which in turn led to supply shortages. Nitrosamines can cause tumors in the liver and other organs in lab animals, and are believed to be carcinogenic in humans. NDMA, which is also found in foods like grilled meat, can form during manufacturing if the chemical reactions used to make the drug are not carefully controlled and monitored, the F.D.A. has said. The agency said the levels it detected in early tests ""barely exceed amounts you might expect to find in common foods."" But Valisure, an online pharmacy company that tests the drugs it sells, said its own investigation detected far higher levels of the contaminant, especially when the drug is subjected to conditions similar to digestion in the stomach. That company has argued that the drug may be reacting with itself to create NDMA.

What action has the government taken? The F.D.A. has said it is still investigating the source of the NDMA contamination as well as the risk to patients. It has not identified any specific products or manufacturers. But other governments have gone a step further. The Italian government said it was recalling all versions of ranitidine where the active ingredient was made by Saraca Laboratories, an Indian manufacturer, and that it was halting the use of some other versions of ranitidine while it studied the issue. The Canadian government requested that manufacturers stop distributing ranitidine in Canada ""until evidence is provided to demonstrate that they do not contain NDMA above acceptable levels."" It also said that current evidence suggests that the NDMA may be present in ranitidine regardless of the manufacturer, indicating it could be a problem inherent to the drug. The agency, Health Canada, said Sandoz had agreed to recall its ranitidine products in that country. Other versions of ranitidine have not been recalled and they can continue to be sold. A spokeswoman for Sanofi said that while the company is not planning a recall, ""we are working closely with the F.D.A. and are conducting our own robust investigations to ensure we continue to meet the highest quality safety and quality standards."" I take Zantac, or someone in my family does. What should we do? The F.D.A. has said it is not telling people to stop taking Zantac, but recommended that patients who take prescription forms of the drug and want to switch should talk to their doctor about alternatives. People who are taking over-the-counter ranitidine should consider taking one of several other heartburn drugs that are available. ""You always want to err on the side of caution,"" said Dr. Gary LeRoy, a family practitioner in Dayton, Ohio and the president-elect of the American Academy of Family Physicians. He said there are several alternative heartburn medicines that people can consider, such as proton-pump inhibitors like Prilosec.",Versions of the drug have been found to contain low levels of a carcinogen. But it's still on pharmacy shelves.

Movies,'The River and the Wall' Review: Taking a Side on the Rio Grande,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/movies/the-river-and-the-wall-review.html,"""The River and the Wall"" comes on as innocent and glossy as a travelogue, but its scenic delights are the sugar coating on a passionate and spectacularly photographed political message. Traveling 1,200 miles along the Rio Grande, from El Paso to the Gulf of Mexico, the director, Ben Masters, and four friends slowly and genially build an ecologically devastating case against the construction of President Trump's much-ballyhooed border wall.

Taking to mountain bikes, horses and canoes, this hardy group -- comprising conservationists, an ornithologist, a river guide and a National Geographic explorer -- is tested by treacherous terrain and dangerous river currents. The adventurers aim to document the possible impact of the proposed barrier on the region's wildlife and residents; but a more personal, pro-immigration note is struck when two team members recall the emotional toll of growing up with undocumented parents.",Adventurers are tested by treacherous terrain and dangerous currents as they aim to document the potential effects of a border wall on wildlife and residents.,d273229e-219c-57ee-89f9-bcd742c43391,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/10/arts/09river/09river-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=4f2114ab4db7db1ae4f1bc2e84b0166a3f18a29361638e0a8e131ab2388869c1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In &ldquo;The River and the Wall,&rdquo; Ben Masters and four friends travel 1,200 miles along the Rio Grande, building an ecologically devastating case against a border wall.",d273229e-219c-57ee-89f9-bcd742c43391,N24News/imgs/d273229e-219c-57ee-89f9-bcd742c43391.jpg,5
Books,Ruth Reichl Dishes on the Last Days of Gourmet Magazine,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/books/review/ruth-reichl-save-me-the-plums.html,"Spoiled for choice, Ruth Reichl frets over a major career choice. Should she accept her dream job as editor in chief of a magazine she has loved since childhood and risk becoming a corporate creature? Or stay put in her imperial post as restaurant critic for The New York Times? We know the ending to this foodie fairy tale, but it's still fun to read ""Save Me the Plums,"" Reichl's poignant and hilarious account of what it took to bring the dusty food bible back to life with artistic and literary flair through the glory days of magazine-making -- from 1999 to the day in the fall of 2009 when she was informed that Conde Nast had decided to close Gourmet's pantry for good. The first course is served when Reichl is courted at a clandestine meeting with a member of Conde Nast's brass at the Algonquin Hotel, followed soon after by lunch with S.I. Newhouse at Da Silvano, the media mogul's favorite downtown watering hole, where she discovers that Newhouse despised garlic (so much that he banned it from Conde Nast's Frank Gehry-designed cafeteria). Undeterred by this and other eccentricities, Reichl peels away the layers of drama that arrive with her new job. (Caution: Former editors might experience indigestion while reveling in Reichl's rich servings of publishing world intrigue.)

She wondered whether she was up to the task of managing a large staff of editors, fact checkers and art directors. As 10 years of inspiring Gourmet issues and now this memoir would attest, the answer was an emphatic yes. Magazine junkies will look back in amazement at the groaning board of perks that once were staples of the job. ""Apparently they pay for everything,"" Reichl informed her husband. ""Country clubs ... hairdressers, travel. You name it."" Other accouterments of the position included a private office bathroom and dining room, a limo and a driver named Mustafa.

Reichl takes us through her crash course in publishing lingo as she discovers the difference between ""teeosees"" (table of contents), ""adjacencies"" (ads situated next to text) and ""inadequate sep"" (when ads are improperly spaced). The ultimate indoctrination into the fraternity of fat expense accounts comes at the airport when Reichl is checking into economy class and the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, standing in the first-class line with the New Yorker editor David Remnick, reprimands her: ""You're at Conde Nast now. ... You shouldn't be traveling like that."" Working mothers will sympathize with Reichl's descriptions of the exhausting rhythms of a ""dream job"" -- in her case, book tours, media interviews and advertising events. One particularly touching moment comes when Reichl realizes that she can't make more time in her schedule for her family and weighs the ultimate compromise: ""Children, I came to understand, need you around even if they ignore you. In fact, they need you around so they can ignore you."" Tantalizing recipes provide punctuation to the career twists and turns. These include the Thanksgiving turkey chili she and her staff cook for rescue workers at ground zero and the spicy Chinese noodles her young son begs her to make for him on a rare night when Reichl is finally able to fix his dinner.

Cooks will marvel at the tasting-kitchen coup when Reichl dazzles her new staff by guessing the origin of a recipe at a blind chocolate cake test -- and even suggests using a better brand of chocolate (Scharffen Berger). Readers will wince at Reichl's discomfort when, at a signing for a book of recipes, she is confronted by a chef about a review that cost him his job. ""'""Bitter salad,""' he quoted sourly -- he had memorized the entire review. '""Mushy sole. Cottony bread."" They fired me after your hatchet job, and I haven't been able to find work since.'"" Hard as a restaurant critic's job can be, Reichl learns that it isn't nearly as draining as navigating the business side of a magazine. She begrudgingly accepts the necessity of making sales calls with publishers. Of course, the upside of dealing with corporate types is having lunch at the Four Seasons, where Reichl is taken by Steve Florio, Conde Nast's chief executive. Her description of the Grill Room's caviar-stuffed ""Florio potato,"" along with her account of the publisher's hostile relationship with Conde Nast's waiflike editorial director, James Truman, is simply delicious. Reichl also recounts the ins and outs of human resources: the revolving door of publishers, the firing and hiring of staff, and how she lured talent to the magazine -- including brilliant writers like Ann Patchett, who puts a turtle on her expense account to save it from certain death in a market on the Amazon, and David Foster Wallace, who delivers 10,000 controversial words on the Maine Lobster Festival. Magazine makers will appreciate Reichl's recipe-like telling of how the art director Richard Ferretti reinvented Gourmet's covers, infusing them with cinematic clarity and drama. When the stock market plunges in 2008 and the housing crisis threatens newsstand sales, Reichl and her staff take a counterintuitive path and head for Paris, jettisoning the Conde Nast ethos of spending as they create an entire issue devoted to budget travel and food. A three-course meal for only 12 euros foreshadows Reichl's final release from Conde Nast's golden handcuffs. When the waitress takes the menu away, announcing that she will decide what's for lunch, Reichl reflects on the barriers money can create: ""The more stars in your itinerary, the less likely you are to find the real life of another country."" Of course, the French know very well that true luxury is measured in portion size, and Reichl eventually loses her appetite for the hefty perks of magazine life. But before she can sign off with her painful descriptions of the ""terrible sense of failure"" that overwhelmed her when she lost her job, each serving of magazine folklore is worth savoring. In fact, Reichl's story is juicier than a Peter Luger porterhouse. Dig in.","""Save Me the Plums"" is a delicious memoir of a decade that took her from the glory days of Condé Nast to the morning when the office door was closed for good.",0889cfc5-3bb0-54fe-9186-85508913754d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/books/review/14Betts1/14Betts1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b84e4ebaf279e55191adea2b2fded3079df08dbf6271a255e1b4ae24b10f0388&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ruth Reichl tasting an avocado flan in Gourmet magazine's test kitchen, April 2009.",0889cfc5-3bb0-54fe-9186-85508913754d,N24News/imgs/0889cfc5-3bb0-54fe-9186-85508913754d.jpg,13
Music,Thomas Adès Brings Fresh Wildness to the Boston Symphony,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/21/arts/music/review-boston-symphony-orchestra-carnegie-hall.html,"Thomas Ades conducted the Boston Symphony on Wednesday in a performance of his Concerto for Piano and Orchestra, featuring Kirill Gerstein.

Many composers also perform on an instrument and conduct. But, in two recent concerts at Carnegie Hall, Thomas Ades took this to another level, demonstrating yet again his extraordinary skill as an all-around musician. Last week at Carnegie's Zankel Hall, he more than held his own as a pianist alongside the virtuoso Kirill Gerstein in a demanding program of works for two pianos. And on Wednesday, on Carnegie's main stage, Mr. Ades led the Boston Symphony Orchestra in the New York premiere of his new Concerto for Piano and Orchestra -- written for Mr. Gerstein, who exhilaratingly dispatched this joyous and audacious piece's formidable solo part. [Read our review of the concerto's premiere in Boston.] To end that program, the second of two Boston Symphony concerts at Carnegie this week, Mr. Ades conducted Tchaikovsky's Fourth Symphony. It makes sense that a composer leading this staple would bring heightened insights into how the music goes, and how the details add up to the whole. Composers wrestle with these issues in their own scores all the time.

The brass fanfare (the ""fate"" motif) that opens the first movement was lean, mean and loud. Yet the mood changed entirely during the sighing, restless main theme, played with yearning. There was nothing smooth, sleek or familiar about this interpretation. During episodes of development, Mr. Ades emphasized the tangled complexity of crisscrossing lines. During the slow movement, which has a wistful theme like a Russian folk song, Mr. Ades drew rich, deep tones from the strings. Yet he also teased out intricacies you seldom notice in other performances of this symphony, even if this meant the overall arc of the music lost some continuity. The scherzo, with its pizzicato strings, was crisp and playful, made intriguing by a hint of obsession. Mr. Ades and the players went all out during the frenetic finale. And why not?

Knowing that Mr. Gerstein also plays jazz piano, Mr. Ades plays to that style in this work. From the start of the bustling first movement, with a theme that seems to nod to the jerky rhythms and rising melody of ""I Got Rhythm,"" there are echoes of Gershwin, the jazz-inspired Ravel and more.

This breathless, 20-minute concerto, structured in three essentially traditional movements (fast, slow, fast), comes across as zesty and accessible. But don't be fooled. Just below the surface, the music sizzles with modernist harmonies, fractured phrases, gaggles of counterpoint and lyrical strands that keep breaking into skittish bits. The finale is a riotous, clattering, assaultive romp. I can't wait to hear it again. [Read more about how the concerto was written.] The Boston Symphony's concert on Tuesday was led by the orchestra's music director, Andris Nelsons. It was an all-Richard Strauss program highlighted by the star soprano Renee Fleming singing a concert version of the closing scene from his final opera, ""Capriccio,"" which she triumphed in at the Metropolitan Opera in 2011. This scene's radiant, gorgeous soliloquy -- in which Countess Madeleine mulls which suitor, a poet or a composer, to favor, and in the process debates whether poetry or music is the greater art -- was made to order for Ms. Fleming's plush, lyrical voice. She sounded wonderful. Then she paid tribute to Andre Previn, who died recently, by singing a deeply expressive account of final aria from the opera he wrote for her, ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" Mr. Nelsons also led a pulsing, dramatic account of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" though I found some of the playing rough and jittery. During this performance, as on other occasions, Mr. Nelsons seemed to be physically uncomfortable, sometimes propping himself up by placing his left hand on the rail around the conductor's podium. But that doesn't mean the orchestra isn't thriving under his leadership. The Boston Symphony recently picked up yet another Grammy Award for its series of Shostakovich recordings. And the latest installment -- featuring the composer's Sixth and Seventh Symphonies -- was just released.","Mr. Adès yet again proved his musical prowess in two Carnegie Hall appearances as a pianist, composer and conductor.

Fashion & Style,"In France, Melania Trump Flies the Fashion Flag of Friendship",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/14/fashion/melania-trump-brigitte-macron-paris.html,"Let no one say that Melania Trump, the first lady of the United States, has not done her part to further French-American relations. On her first two foreign tours, Mrs. Trump seemed not to entirely embrace the practice known as sartorial diplomacy, in which dignitaries use clothing as a strategic platform. She dipped in and out of meaningful imagery with her outfits and their origins, keeping everyone (the public, her husband, his aides) guessing as to whether she was going to engage fully with that aspect of her role. But on her Bastille Day visit to Paris with her husband, Mrs. Trump fully committed. Indeed, it was almost as if she had packed according to theme. Which was? The flags, French and American.

It began Thursday morning when she left Air Force One in a bright red Dior Bar skirt suit, a modern interpretation of the signature shape, and an outfit chosen, according to her stylist and sometime couturier, Herve Pierre, in honor of the 70th anniversary of the storied fashion house. ""For me, Dior is like the Eiffel Tower; it's associated with Paris forever,"" Mr. Pierre said.

Next to Mr. Trump's navy suit, white shirt and bright blue tie, Mrs. Trump's version, from the current spring collection, created an unmistakably patriotic picture as the couple stood on the tarmac. It was followed later that day by a dress designed by Mr. Pierre for the dinner that Mrs. Trump and the president had with President Emmanuel Macron of France and his wife, Brigitte, at Le Jules Verne, a restaurant in the (yes) Eiffel Tower. The dress had a white bodice, red insert at the waist and blue pencil skirt, the top covered in wheatlike appliques. Wheat being, Mr. Pierre said, the ""favorite flower"" of another famed French designer, Yves Saint Laurent. Not to mention the fact that Marianne, the symbolic female face of France, is often depicted carrying a sheaf of wheat. (Coco Chanel also regularly used the iconography in her work.) That outfit was followed Friday morning at the Bastille Day military parade by a white sleeveless full-skirted Valentino dress covered in bouquets of red tulips and blue cornflowers. Cornflowers, or bleuets, are the French equivalent of the British poppy: the flower of remembrance. (Events in Paris were also commemorating the 100th anniversary of the United States' entry into World War I.) Admittedly, Valentino is an Italian brand. But the house has its fashion shows in Paris. Besides, Mr. Pierre bought the dress on Mrs. Trump's behalf a few weeks before, and given that they only had two weeks to get ready for the trip, they seem to have been strategically shopping her closet.

As a visual demonstration that this trip was about outreach and about what the United States and France might share -- and a nod to a little cultural sensitivity and knowledge -- the selections may not have been subtle, but they were effective. Especially when engaged in silent bilateral meetings with the Louis Vuitton looks of Ms. Macron, who has been consistently wearing that core French brand since her husband took office. Ms. Macron's appearances in a white Vuitton dress with navy Vuitton shoes and bag to greet the Trumps, a Vuitton lace dress with silver collar for the Eiffel Tower dinner, and a navy Vuitton silk dress and jacket for the Bastille Day parade were further proof that she has unofficially decided to work with the house on crafting her image. One that uses a name embedded in French patrimony but wrested into the 21st century by the designer Nicolas Ghesquiere to communicate a mix of history and modernity. If you're wondering what shape that takes, think minidresses with motorcycle-wear detailing. Mrs. Trump has not been this consistent, and seemingly deliberate, in her approach to her public wardrobe since her husband's inauguration. Whatever the reason for the change -- a desire to distract from the controversies swirling at home, to show clear support for her husband's attempt at friend-making, or perhaps because she is getting more familiar with the exigencies of her role -- it's a new episode in the reality show that is the Trump administration.","A wardrobe in red, white and blue signified a new stage in the first lady's relationship with political image making.",73428f2c-ebce-517a-a93c-6dccff11e782,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/15/fashion/14melania-3/14melania-3-facebookJumbo-v5.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=99856494a4faf26b34e2532cd77a7817703932e7dee9b833b86723b1785e4ab4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Melania Trump, left, wore Valentino to the Bastille Day military parade in Paris on Friday.

Media,"Logan Paul, YouTube Star, Says Posting Video of Dead Body Was 'Misguided'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/business/media/logan-paul-youtube.html,"Logan Paul's YouTube channel has more than 15 million subscribers, making him even more popular than his younger brother, Jake.

A YouTube star with millions of followers apologized on Monday for posting a video that showed a dead body hanging from a tree in a Japanese forest known as a destination for suicide victims. Logan Paul, 22, posted an apology on Twitter after the video attracted a torrent of criticism online, saying that he had published it in an attempt to raise awareness about suicide and suicide prevention. ""I was misguided by shock and awe, as portrayed in the video,"" he said. ""I still am.""

""I should have never posted the video. I should have put the cameras down,"" he said. The original video, which has since been removed from YouTube but is available elsewhere online, begins with Mr. Paul warning viewers that the following footage is graphic. ""This definitely marks a moment in YouTube history,"" he says. ""Because I'm pretty sure that this has never hopefully happened to anyone on YouTube ever."" ""Now with that said, buckle up,"" Mr. Paul adds, cursing for effect. As the video proceeds, Mr. Paul describes the reputation of the Aokigahara forest, which has become well-known in the past decade as a destination for people looking to kill themselves. In 2016 alone, three North American films were set in the forest, which lies at the base of Mount Fuji, a sacred site in Japan. Local folk tales have also fueled talk about the paranormal within the forest, a subject that Mr. Paul eagerly latches onto as he and his companions begin their trek with a guide.

In the next scene, they come across the body. The face is blurred; the rest is left visible. Mr. Paul and the others react in shock and Mr. Paul urges the guide to call the police.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""Yo, are you alive?"" he shouts toward the body. As a camera pans over the body, which Mr. Paul later says is only about 100 yards away from the parking lot, he describes its condition, and speculates that the death was recent. He apologizes to his viewers and says that suicide, depression and mental illness are not a joke. As the group leaves the area where the body was found, Mr. Paul, who has television experience and has trained with comedy troupes, begins to engage in the kinds of behavior most familiar to his viewers: exaggerated reaction shots and nervous laughter. The tone soon becomes more antic as Mr. Paul and the others appear to try to lighten the mood. Toward the end of the video, Mr. Paul says that his smiling and laughing ""is not a portrayal of how I feel about the circumstances,"" describing it as his coping mechanism. The video, which was posted on Sunday, quickly received pushback online, as people reacted to Mr. Paul's decision to show the body and his capering afterward. Some shared numbers for suicide hotlines and told stories about their own struggles with mental illness.

""Our hearts go out to the family of the person featured in the video,"" the statement said. Mr. Paul's YouTube channel has more than 15 million subscribers, making him even more popular than his younger brother, Jake, who may be more well-known to those who do not regularly watch vlogs thanks to his own brushes with controversy. YouTube stars are often incentivized to post increasingly eye-catching footage in a bid for subscribers, who are attracted to more outlandish clips. After Jake Paul drew the attention of mainstream news outlets over the summer for, essentially, annoying his neighbors on camera, he posted another video in which he tried to convince people that he had been arrested, upping the ante after the surge of press. The brothers' audiences are largely made up of younger people. Toward the end of the Japan video, Logan Paul runs into a young fan in the parking lot who is with an older chaperone. ""I have one piece of advice,"" he tells them, smiling and pointing to where the body is. ""Don't go over there.""","Mr. Paul, 22, posted a video that showed a body hanging from a tree in a Japanese forest that is known as a destination for suicide victims.",fccf05f2-bf9d-5433-96bf-e6287ef37bfc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/02/world/03xp-loganpaul/03xp-loganpaul-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=60c40b6e21f6ef0b30cb4447bd5b52dbc053e3595436d0ee6b0cdecfa1faf480&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Logan Paul's YouTube channel has more than 15 million subscribers, making him even more popular than his younger brother, Jake.<a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/arts/who-is-jake-paul.html""><br /></a>",fccf05f2-bf9d-5433-96bf-e6287ef37bfc,N24News/imgs/fccf05f2-bf9d-5433-96bf-e6287ef37bfc.jpg,16

Automobiles,Making the Best of Awkward Timing,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/automobiles/autoshow/making-the-best-of-awkward-timing.html,"MORE than 50 vehicles made their world or North American premieres at the 2012 Los Angeles auto show, organizers proclaimed, during two days of press previews before the doors were opened to the public on Friday.

On a Georgia Island, a Lot of Good Food and Plenty of Nothing



This week's U.S. Islands special package celebrates the charming, often dreamy life to be found off American coasts and within its lakes. Below, Kim Severson writes about Cumberland Island, Ga., full of charm but not easy to get to. Padre Island, in Texas, offers soft sand and seclusion. The islands of Lake Champlain, in Vermont, are filled with history and legend. Wisconsin's Apostle Islands, in Lake Superior, offer stunning sea caves and plenty of creature comforts. Jamie Ferguson hiked up a leg of his wet swim trunks. ""It's not that bad,"" he said. I had never seen a scar from a shark bite before, so I had no way to gauge if the pale patch the size of a paperback on his thigh was indeed not that bad. Mr. Ferguson, 59, got the shark bite doing exactly what we were doing now, which was pulling a wide strip of netting attached to a couple of pieces of wood through the murky Atlantic surf in an attempt to catch dinner. He grew up fishing this wide, empty beach on Cumberland Island, a stretch of land about four miles longer than Manhattan that sits just off the southern curve of Georgia's 100-mile coastline.

Mr. Ferguson is a descendant of the Carnegies, who once owned almost the entire island. Thomas Carnegie, considered the better-looking and more amiable younger brother of the industrialist Andrew Carnegie, was one of his great-great-grandfathers. The two men made their fortunes from iron and steel. At the turn of the 20th century, they were as rich and powerful as the digital barons are now. In the way that the Facebook co-founder Mark Zuckerberg and the Oracle billionaire Larry Ellison have bought up large chunks of Hawaii, the barons of the Gilded Age took control of Georgia's barrier islands. Jekyll Island, just to the north, was the most popular. Today, it has 63 holes of golf and a water park. Cumberland had a different fate. Andrew Carnegie married late and gave most of his fortune away, building the performance hall in New York that bears his name, along with thousands of public libraries and several universities. Thomas Carnegie was a family man who had nine children. He and his wife, Lucy, invested in Cumberland, building a winter playground so elaborate it took 200 people just to maintain it.

""To us, it's still just home,"" Mr. Ferguson said. To get there, I flew to the airport at Jacksonville, Fla., and spent about 45 minutes in a cab to the private ferry at Fernandina Beach that serves the Greyfield Inn, one of four glorious houses Lucy Carnegie had built on the island for her children. Only one, Greyfield, has been turned into an inn. Rooms top out at $635 a night with all meals included. Lately, with a revived kitchen garden and a hotshot young chef named Whitney Otawka, the meals have become one of the best parts of a stay. Without a reservation for one of the inn's 10 rooms or the six rooms in its cottages, visitors to the island have to take a park service ferry from the small village of St. Mary's, Ga. Only 300 people a day are allowed to visit, including a small number of adventurous campers who receive permits to pitch a tent on one of five rustic campsites. Of course, if you are one of the Carnegies, you can land a small plane on the meadow that serves as an airstrip. But buzz it first to make sure no wild horses are lingering on the grass.

They eat the smooth cord grass that pokes up in the marshes and sea oats that protect the dunes. They trample turtle beds. Whether the horses do more damage than the feral pigs on the island remains up for debate. Some say the horses came with Spanish or British settlers. Others connect them to the enslaved Africans who picked Sea Island cotton here. The Confederate cavalry requisitioned them during the Civil War, and the Carnegies bred them with Tennessee walkers and Arabians to improve the stock. Still, they are a lovely aspect of Cumberland Island, where there is plenty to do and nothing to do. Hikers seek solitude. Historians look for stories. I came to eat and to learn about a family that helped save the place from golf courses and condominiums. Before I could eat, I was going to have to fish. Only certain residents and the Park Service are allowed to have vehicles on the island, and I found myself bouncing along in a truck along a soft sand road with the chef and a few Carnegie descendants.

Fishing this way requires walking into the cold surf until the water hits you about midchest. One person holds a pole attached to a long piece of net fixed with floats at the top and lead weights at the bottom. Someone else stands maybe 150 feet away, holding another pole to which the other end of the net is secured. You jerk up the net at the same time and walk toward the shore, capturing whatever happens to be swimming in front of you. We pulled in some drum and red fish, tossing back the ones too big to legally keep. A little lemon shark went back into the water, too, along with some horseshoe crabs. Then we headed to the Greyfield, where Ms. Otawka, 36, a former ""Top Chef"" contestant, was to help her crew get dinner ready. I first tasted her food when she was putting out regional Mexican dishes at a restaurant in Athens, Ga., owned by the chef Hugh Acheson. When Mr. Acheson pulled the plug on that place, she bounced around a little, sometimes cooking at pop-ups in Atlanta and other food events. She picked up her first cooking job at a French restaurant in Oakland, Calif., while she was a student at the University of California, Berkeley. She also worked at a tattoo shop there, which helps explain all her ink. Ms. Otawka landed at the Greyfield nearly two years ago, welcomed by Mitty and Mary Ferguson, Jamie's brother and sister-in-law. The couple manage the inn. They wanted to breathe new life into the food, and Ms. Otawka wanted an adventure.

""Chefs live such unbalanced lives,"" she said. ""This is all about balance. You get to live in a beautiful place and cook good food. It was a chance and I took it."" Life here can be isolating. Cellphone service is unreliable, the inn isn't wired for Wi-Fi and a ferry is the only way to and from the island. For company, Ms. Otawka has her husband and her elderly pit bull. Ben Wheatley, 30, is also a chef at the inn. He and Ms. Otawka fell in love cooking at one of Mr. Acheson's restaurants and married in Mexico late last year. They have dedicated themselves, at least for the moment, to cooking on an island that is right out of a Wes Anderson movie. (He scouted the island as a location for his film ""Moonrise Kingdom."") Greyfield was built in 1900 as a gift to one of Lucy and Thomas Carnegie's daughters. It has been an inn only since the 1960s, when Jamie's grandmother realized that their slice of the Carnegie fortune was dwindling while taxes and the cost of Greyfield's upkeep grew. The grandmother, Lucy Ferguson, had long been a fierce champion of the island. She was a collector of animal bones and Indian artifacts, a protector of the wild horses and a cattle rancher who never made much money from the 500 head she tended.

Her portrait hangs in the mansion's drawing room, a scarf around her head and a dagger at her side. I slept in her childhood bedroom, a windowpane still bearing her name and the little picture she etched there in 1915. For years, the inn was the kind of place where people had to dress formally for a dinner that was often prime rib, with creme de menthe over ice cream for dessert. Since Ms. Otawka came, things have changed. Boxed lunches are still free to any guests who want to pack one along as they explore the island, but instead of fried chicken, the offering might be poached chicken over snap pea salad dressed up with anchovies and Calabrian peppers. Jacques Pepin, who spends winter vacations nearby, visited the island recently, and Ms. Otawka cooked lunch for him. ""He said I cooked like his grandmother and mother,"" she said. Before dinner, guests order a cocktail and mark their purchases on a pad. On the patio, oysters are roasted over a wood fire and tossed into a metal bucket at the end of a table set with oyster knives and saltines. Guests can shuck all they want, dipping warm nuggets of meat into melted butter.

Gogo, which is what everyone calls her, is an artist who turns the teeth, bones and plants she finds combing the island into gold and silver jewelry. Where someone else might see a raccoon penis, she sees earrings. Snake ribs become a ring, kelp a wall sculpture. She has a photograph of Hillary Clinton wearing a necklace she molded from armadillo scales. At first it's hard to believe that she is as connected as she says she is, and that her jewelry is as in demand. Mikhail Baryshnikov really liked to eat raw clams and drink beer here? Then you see the snapshot of him, barefoot and grinning on the beach, and read the introduction he wrote to the book published when an exhibition of her work was at the High Museum of Art in Atlanta. ""I was walking on the beach with my dog, Penny,"" Ms. Otawka said. ""Gogo's truck goes rolling by and she stops and she's like, 'This is my friend Bill.' And Bill Murray is in the front seat."" Gogo offered to drive me to the small wooden First African Baptist Church, which was established in 1893 as part of a settlement designed so that the African-Americans who worked on the island could begin to own land.

Her friend John F. Kennedy Jr. was so enchanted with it and with Cumberland that he asked Gogo to help him and Carolyn Bessette hold their wedding here. She managed to do it in secrecy, shuttling 50 guests on and off the island without a word leaking to the press. She even designed their rings. The Kennedy clan, she said, was just lovely. ""Teddy got up and said I cannot believe this place and I know how proud your parents would be that you picked this place to get married,"" she said. John called her a few days later from Istanbul, where the newlyweds were honeymooning. The paparazzi were relentless. ""Why the hell did I ever leave Cumberland?"" she said he told her. I headed back to Gogo's place with Ms. Otawka after dinner. The tequila came out, and so did more stories. They talked about a private spaceport Camden County officials want to build just west of Cumberland Island, complained about a zealous new park ranger and worried about a plan to rezone a small slice of the island for private development. But pressure to change the island is nothing new, and neither is their response to it. ""What we have is more valuable than money,"" Jamie Ferguson said. ""The money is gone anyway,"" Gogo added. ""This has been handed down to us momentarily to take care of and pass on. What's wrong with leaving it the way it is?""","Cumberland Island offers memorable meals, fine fishing, wild horses, empty beaches and a rich history.",0614799d-c824-5769-aa97-f77cc6f7efa9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/11/travel/11GEORGIA/11GEORGIA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=62968314c73c17d073e2128766e8dea073c3346e28b351051e6fd91bf8942431&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The sun sets behind an oak tree on Cumberland, Georgia's largest and wildest barrier island.",0614799d-c824-5769-aa97-f77cc6f7efa9,N24News/imgs/0614799d-c824-5769-aa97-f77cc6f7efa9.jpg,4
Media,WikiLeaks' Gift to American Democracy,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/business/media/rutenberg-wikileaks-american-democracy.html,"You sure have to hand it to the Russians. They understand the power of free-flowing information, how it can upend government and politics. It's why they don't let information flow too freely in their own country. And it's why, if United States intelligence assessments are correct, they have worked so hard to send it roaring through ours. There is a certain kind of brilliance to the way the Russians are said to have hacked the email accounts of senior Democratic officials and gifted the contents to their BFFs at WikiLeaks. The Russians seem to be using the United States' free press -- a great symbol of our democracy -- against it while setting up an impossible choice for American newsrooms: Run with the stolen and in many cases unverified correspondence and potentially assist an audacious Russian attempt to disrupt a presidential election, or decline to print it and betray their mission to combat the great political fog machine.

Declining to cover the emails would play into accusations that the media is censoring news that would be helpful to Donald J. Trump. In that case, the Russians get a nice consolation prize: fodder for their disingenuous argument that if any system is ""rigged,"" it's the United States', so judge not lest you be judged. Khrushchev would be proud. But the whole thing seems to be backfiring. In this, the year of the leak, the hackers are contributing to a phenomenon -- raw transparency -- that should make democracy stronger. Taken together, this year's big breaches -- nefarious and otherwise -- are bringing a dose of reality to this reality television campaign, exposing what the candidates or their aides say and do when they think no one is looking. And they have pulled back the curtain on the political-celebrity mythmaking that the American media too often abets. Exhibit A is a 2006 People magazine article about Donald and Melania Trump. ""During their first year of marriage, Donald and Melania Trump reveled in being a twosome,"" People said as it took note of their first anniversary and Melania's pregnancy.

Mr. O'Keefe has a history of selectively editing his videos to create misleading or false impressions. As The New York Times and The Washington Post have noted, it is unclear whether Mr. Foval accomplished what he boasted about. But the party strategist Mr. Foval was working for, Robert Creamer, fired him and then ceased his own work for the Democratic National Committee. (He disputed Mr. Foval's claims of inciting violence.) Mr. Foval's words alone should be enough to remind reporters that there are people who are paid to distort the picture they present. If he did succeed in his plans, and drew headlines that depicted Mr. Trump's supporters as attacking protesters without provocation, he got one over on the news media as much as he did on Mr. Trump. Which brings me back to the Russians. Is that what they are doing, playing the media for their own purposes? On Thursday, a private internet security firm, Dell SecureWorks, said the Russian hackers that the United States officially blamed for breaking into Democratic Party accounts over the summer were involved in the latest WikiLeaks email dump, which came from the account of a senior Clinton adviser, John Podesta. The WikiLeaks founder, Julian Assange, has declined to disclose the source of the emails. Saying the Russians have ""weaponized"" WikiLeaks, the Clinton campaign will not readily verify the authenticity of the emails, though it has not issued blanket denials, either. Brian Fallon, the campaign spokesman, told me he had been warning reporters against taking the emails at face value and reminding them not to lose sight of their provenance. Then there is the fact that they are from Mr. Podesta's private account. All of it has made reporting on the emails incredibly fraught. Even Glenn Greenwald of The Intercept, who helped bring to light Edward J. Snowden's leaks, has expressed qualms about poring over personal emails (along with skepticism of Russia's suspected role in stealing them). ""Even people who are in powerful positions and wield influence continue to retain the right to privacy, and there should never be any publishing of personal matters or things that aren't directly in the public interest,"" he said in a discussion about the emails with the author Naomi Klein.

But Mr. Greenwald said there was too much of a public interest at stake to ignore emails that ""shed light on the person highly likely to be the next president of the United States."" Most of the mainstream news media has taken the same position. As Susan Glasser, the Politico editor, told me, it's not every day that you get a ""real-time look"" at the decision-making of a major presidential campaign. And it's not as if there is much of a choice, anyway, she said, given that ""we can't unknow things that are in the public space."" That is, the emails are out there. It is the job of the mainstream press to use reporting to determine their validity and significance, and put their contents in their proper context. That's especially important when misleading, partisan interpretations can bounce around the internet at the speed of Twitter, which serves Russia most of all. The emails have shown cynical approaches by Hillary Clinton and her team to fund-raising; a penchant for secrecy; a coziness with reporters that is too often the case with both parties in Washington; and a calculated approach to environmental issues, free trade and banking that is already causing trouble on her left flank, as Politico reported. They have not brought a major scandal to the surface, at least not yet, and even won praise from some supporters like The Post's editorial page, which said they showed Mrs. Clinton's ""sound policy instincts."" They've certainly not blown up the system, as might happen in a more closed, undemocratic form of government. If repressive foreign governments want to make a regular thing of hacking into United States leaders' email to undermine the country, and domestic politicians like Mr. Trump want to keep embracing that kind of ""help,"" then the news media may have to rethink how to handle it.",Revelations about Donald Trump and the Clinton campaign have pulled back the curtain on the political-celebrity mythmaking the media too often abets.,94cab103-3b11-5b98-a82b-10eebfcc0781,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/24/business/24rutenberg/24rutenberg-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5e19e7df34876e9fbb4f2c99ce843485f1843bba6ccc404c1c776325b146fdf0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julian Assange, who has sought asylum at the Ecuadorean Embassy in London, has not revealed the source of Democratic emails.",94cab103-3b11-5b98-a82b-10eebfcc0781,N24News/imgs/94cab103-3b11-5b98-a82b-10eebfcc0781.jpg,16
Dance,Review: Jessica Lang Dance Looks at Soldiers and Sonnets,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/arts/dance/review-jessica-lang-dance-looks-at-soldiers-and-sonnets.html,"It's all about imagery: army fatigues, ink splatters and a train of fabric that stretches long or gathers in a swirl around a woman's ankles. Is it a lake or quicksand? Probably both. Jessica Lang's dances may be subdued, but they don't embrace subtlety.

On Tuesday, Jessica Lang Dance returned to the Joyce Theater in celebration of its fifth anniversary. In September, the company will move into a new dance center in Long Island City, Queens, where classes will be offered at all levels. It's an impressive accomplishment. If only the same could be said of Ms. Lang's tepid choreography, which is frequently performed by ballet companies, and illustrates how quickly simplicity can slide into blandness.

The Joyce program features three New York premieres, including ""Solo Bach"" (2008), in which Patrick Coker, upbeat and high-spirited, starts out with his back to the audience. Kicking a leg forward with a jaunty hop, he faces us with upturned palms -- a greeting that is repeated throughout -- and presses ahead with fleet footwork and airy jumps. It's sweet, yet overwrought.","The troupe, celebrating its fifth anniversary, returned to the Joyce Theater with three New York premieres on its program.",6b38b82a-335e-5e97-a982-5d020876551f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/16/arts/16LANGDANCE2/16LANGDANCE2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=334de7306ee635953c4d45a6a4150bb3c9c8cfd23b2f8d0ca1c46039ee062860&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Clifton Brown, John Harnage and Jammie Walker in ""Thousand Yard Stare.""",6b38b82a-335e-5e97-a982-5d020876551f,N24News/imgs/6b38b82a-335e-5e97-a982-5d020876551f.jpg,6
Movies,'Black Mother' Review: Exploring the Roots of Life Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/06/movies/black-mother-review.html,"There's a good deal of water imagery in ""Black Mother,"" the new film by Khalik Allah. A shot of a waterfall feeding a stream, verdant trees and plants crowding its banks intermittently repeats. Overhead footage shows a foamy tide coming in and going out. Water is life, and ""Black Mother"" announces itself as an evocation, invocation and chronicle of birth and life. ""First trimester,"" a female voice says, as Allah holds on a full-frame view of a naked woman, the vivid life of her skin contrasting with the gray wall behind her.

Allah's previous film, the staggering ""Field Niggas"" (2015), was shot in Manhattan, homing in on bedraggled drug addicts and mentally ill people on the streets of East Harlem. ""Black Mother"" was shot in Jamaica (his mother's native country, where he has spent time over the years), and in its early scenes depicts deprivation and desperation not dissimilar to what his earlier film showed in such disconcerting focus. Here, Allah's camera is more mobile than before, following streetwalking prostitutes while we hear the sounds of male voices negotiating with them over prices for specific sexual acts.","In Khalik Allah's poetic movie, the most prevalent perspective is not that of a documentarian, but of a filmmaker's love.",5795898c-c06b-52eb-b28e-685388536005,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/08/arts/08blackmother-print/black1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c639ecff929501fb0d5db6e374a38a92f123650aefcccd1e55cd6523d0b7ffa5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from the documentary &ldquo;Black Mother,&rdquo; directed by Khalik Allah.",5795898c-c06b-52eb-b28e-685388536005,N24News/imgs/5795898c-c06b-52eb-b28e-685388536005.jpg,5
Real Estate,How you can create space in a tiny home,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/21/realestate/how-you-can-create-space-in-a-tiny-home.html,"This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life's opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com. Let go of that T-shirt you've had since middle school, the cracked mirror that you haven't had time to replace and the lamp that works only when you kick it on the third try. When you're trying to maximize a small space, every inch counts, from under the bed to unclaimed wall space over your head. While moving is considered one of life's great stressors, living in a small space doesn't have to be. All it takes is some thoughtful planning and smart storage options. For Julia Haney Montanez, an interior designer living alone for the first time in Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, purging is the first step to making the most of what you have.

""You have to stop being a hoarder,"" Ms. Montanez, 30, said this week in her studio apartment. ""The secret to small-space living is trying to avoid owning too much stuff; that's a good practice for life. You don't have to be a minimalist, but you have to get really creative where you store your things and maybe think twice about buying something new."" Once you've winnowed down your belongings, it's time to consider how to use your limited space.

Ms. Montanez, a producer for the Architectural Digest show and a freelance designer, lives in a 450-square-foot studio. When she first moved in, Ms. Montanez spent hours looking at the floor plan and figuring out the ideal configuration for her furniture. By living in the space for a while before making any major purchases, Ms. Montanez said, you get an idea of how to make your home as functional as possible. ""As you live in the apartment you'll know and understand what you need,"" she said. ""Do you have your freeloader friends crashing all the time? Then get a longer sofa. If not, get a smaller sofa because they take up so much space. Get to know your own space before you start throwing money at those things.""

If you have the opportunity to splurge, Ms. Montanez recommends creating a custom piece. For her it was a California Closet and a table that doubles as her office desk. ""It was the best decision,"" she said of the custom closet. ""Everything goes in there."" Shoes, cleaning supplies and home office material like fabric swatches all live in her closet, neatly tucked away in designated cubbies alongside double hanging clothes racks. ""Take your dinner money for the next month and put it toward something that will fit perfectly,"" she said. ""It's like Tetris, and it's that one thing you need."" Making a tight spot work can require bending the rules on traditional uses of space. Consider using a medicine cabinet for storing glassware or kitchen cabinets for sweater storage if cooking isn't a priority. Every space has to serve a purpose, said Susan Winberg, an interior designer based in New York City. ""It has to have more than one function,"" she said. Ms. Winberg typically takes on larger residential projects, she said, but with two children in their 20s, she began designing projects with much more limited space. Her daughter's San Francisco railroad-style apartment, for example, had a Murphy bed alcove with no bed in it, she said. They put her bed elsewhere in the apartment and converted the alcove into a closet. If you have limited closet space, prioritize where you store your things, Ms. Winberg advised. The Murphy bed closet is tucked away, so Ms. Winberg's daughter uses that area to store winter clothes and boots, saving her more accessible closet for things that she uses more regularly.

Madeline Fraser, one of the founders of a new app called Homee, which offers personal design services and a virtual showroom, summed up a similar approach to coping with small spaces in two words: up and out. ""The use of the wall space is where you're going to maximize your overall space,"" she said. Ms. Fraser recommended putting storage on walls with open floating shelving, an affordable option, she said, especially for renters who can easily Spackle the wall when it's time to move out. And shelving can go beyond the living room and bedroom, too. Open shelving in kitchens, especially in a galley or small kitchen, can make the room feel more open. ""When you have cabinets, it can appear closed off like there's a wall there,"" she said. Everyone thinks, 'Oh, I have to have cabinets,' but you can easily do open shelving and arrange your kitchen stuff to look cool. It will feel more like a restaurant."" To keep things looking tidy, Ms. Fraser suggested bringing symmetry to open shelves by displaying dishes, cutting boards and kitchen accessories stacked in clusters or leaning against the wall. Books and bookends offer a way to ground shelving, too, she said. And for miscellaneous items, wire baskets can help contain odds and ends that may be without a home. At a bare minimum, get the mattress and box spring off the floor, Ms. Fraser said. Every big piece of furniture should have legs if possible, to provide storage space underneath. ""You can get an iron-rod bed frame that gives you more storage under your bed,"" she said. ""You can do a bed skirt and put a lot under your bed. Your mom will not be happy with you if she comes over and sees the bed on the floor.""","With careful planning, a tiny home doesn't have to be stressful.",ecc3337e-88c2-523c-b2af-3efa6c174e92,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/21/realestate/21space2/21space2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=a06fc1e82bfc65be7cf702d431319835cf7f0d6e1c6be92c7d2e7f25e226eeca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julia Haney Montanez, an interior designer living Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood, maximizes space with folding chairs.",ecc3337e-88c2-523c-b2af-3efa6c174e92,N24News/imgs/ecc3337e-88c2-523c-b2af-3efa6c174e92.jpg,7
Theater,Jessica Hecht to Star in a New Play by Calvin Trillin,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/09/theater/theater-for-a-new-audience-season.html,"A new play by Calvin Trillin starring Jessica Hecht, as well as imports from the Young Vic in London and the Theatre des Bouffes du Nord in Paris, are in store for the 2018-19 season at Theater for a New Audience, the company announced Wednesday.

""About Alice,"" Mr. Trillin's adaptation of his 2007 memoir about the death of his wife and muse, is scheduled to run Jan. 8 through Feb. 3, with Ms. Hecht in the title role. ""Sometimes we come across a piece of first-person writing that shocks us back into a restorative innocence vis-a-vis the human heart,"" Peter Stevenson wrote in The New York Times Book Review when the memoir was published, calling it a ""slim but walloping book.""

The season begins with a study of power and corruptibility: an adaptation of Ryszard Kapuscinski's ""The Emperor"" (Sept. 9-30), about the Ethiopian emperor Haile Selassie, which ran at the Young Vic in 2016. The play is ""neither a piece of invective nor an exotic excursion,"" the critic Susannah Clapp wrote in The Guardian of that production.

Music,Soccer Mommy Confronts All the Disappointments of Love on 'Clean',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/arts/music/soccer-mommy-clean-review.html,"Love is no paradise in the songs of Sophie Allison, 20, who records as Soccer Mommy. It's a realm of misunderstandings, disappointments, unfulfilled longings and everyday betrayals, and Soccer Mommy's songs recount them in a haze of acceptance and resentment. ""In the summer you said you loved me like an animal/Stayed beside me just enough to keep your belly full,"" Ms. Allison sings in ""So Clean""; then she devotes the remaining verses to missing him, predatory as he is, through the fall, winter and spring.

Soccer Mommy joins a wavelet of young women -- along with Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers, Mitski and many others -- who are using gentle voices, pristine melodies and the expressive imperfections of indie rock for songs that probe vulnerability and trauma, self-sabotage and self-preservation. They are continuing a longstanding role of female singer-songwriters as pop's bearers of emotional sensitivity and catharsis. But in the era of SoundCloud and Bandcamp, they need no one's help or permission to go public. Whether anyone will listen is another question, but Soccer Mommy got through.

Ms. Allison began posting home-recorded songs to Bandcamp as Soccer Mommy in 2015, during the summer when she was about to leave her hometown, Nashville, for college at New York University. (She has since dropped out and returned to Nashville to pursue her music career.) As Soccer Mommy, she wrote about leaving behind her first love, about new independence and infatuations, about dodging the gaze of parents, about having to suddenly feel ""grown."" At first, with just a guitar, she was lonely and forlorn above all; her early digital EPs were titled ""Songs for the Recently Sad"" and ""Songs From My Bedroom.""",The 20-year-old singer and songwriter Sophie Allison expands her sound and lyrical scope on her debut album.,f6dac1f8-e5ca-568c-b19a-ed2546b4cfee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/01/arts/01album-soccer/01album-soccer-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=ff06bc39936ebbf347b272ba184d1d5c37eec18789d5c0649122fa188d993e77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sophie Allison, who records as Soccer Mommy, started posting her music to Bandcamp in 2015.",f6dac1f8-e5ca-568c-b19a-ed2546b4cfee,N24News/imgs/f6dac1f8-e5ca-568c-b19a-ed2546b4cfee.jpg,12
Art & Design,How to Fix the Met: Connect Art to Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/arts/design/how-to-fix-the-met-connect-art-to-life.html,"Where has the money gone? To what some people see as crazy things: an absurdly costly rebranding campaign; dubious digital initiatives; and the leasing of the Whitney Museum's Breuer Building, with the idea of making the Met a contemporary art contender. Again, purely in terms of art, the Breuer venture, after a rocky start, has been a success, though a hugely expensive one.

For a while now, the museum has been looking good, but not feeling that way. I've often picked up a sense that people were gunning for Mr. Campbell early on, ready to find that he could do no right. I've also sensed that the museum had increasingly entered a state of drift. Crowds herd through; curators do what they do. But the fizz generated by an institution really on the go is flat.

What could revive it? Solvency would help, although I, who can't balance a checkbook, can say nothing useful on that subject.

What I can talk about is art, and how a museum can make people care about it. If historical art is now a hard sell, and it is, learn to sell it hard. That means, among other things, start telling the truth about it: about who made objects, and how they work in the world, and how they got to the museum, and what they mean, what values they advertise, good and bad. Go for truth (which, like the telling of history, is always changing), and connect art to life. Mix things up: periods, functions, cultures. (You can always unmix them.) Let audiences see that old is always new, if viewed through knowledge.

To present art this way -- to pitch it, advocate it, make it snap to life -- is to rethink the basic dynamic of a museum, turn it from passive to active, from archival to interactive, while letting it be all of these. This is the work of curators, and the Met has some fantastic ones. But to do their job boldly and radically, they need the attentive, encouraging permission of an alert director, probably meaning one who isn't also saddled with being the company's chief accountant.

Right now, America is in an emotionally and morally raw moment. Diversity everywhere is under attack; the culture wars are back. Our cultural institutions cannot not react. Mr. Campbell did so, mainstream, last month in a New York Times Op-Ed article on why art matters, demanding the preservation of the National Endowment for the Arts, which is now under threat. It was an important statement, a valedictory gesture, it turns out, and a worthy one. It set an example of public activism that his Met successor should heed and follow.

And about that successor, I'll just say this to the Met's board: Put women on your short list of potential hires as director. It's time. And bring more African-Americans and Latino curators to your staff (and to your short list). It's time. These are crucial steps to getting a cherished antique of an institution tuned up for 21st-century life. It's time.","The Metropolitan Museum of Art must start by mixing things up — periods, functions, cultures. It also must hire a more diverse staff, and react to the times.",5f92f9f7-6672-5b16-8b1e-57402699f42e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/02/arts/02METjp/02METjp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=62f1325d54502157cbc2fe18f0d946d60855d6f53b883512dc8c260253e02a33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A view of the Met's European Sculpture and Decorative Arts space.

Opinion,"When I Step Outside, I Step Into a Country of Men Who Stare",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/opinion/pakistan-women-patriarchy.html,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- I am angry. All the time. I've been angry for years. Ever since I began to grasp the staggering extent of violence -- emotional, mental and physical -- against women in Pakistan. Women here, all 100 million of us, exist in collective fury. ""Every day, I am reminded of a reason I shouldn't exist,"" my 19-year-old friend recently told me in a cafe in Islamabad. When she gets into an Uber, she sits right behind the driver so that he can't reach back and grab her. We agreed that we would jump out of a moving car if that ever happened. We debated whether pepper spray was better than a knife. When I step outside, I step into a country of men who stare. I could be making the short walk from my car to the bookstore or walking through the aisles at the supermarket. I could be wrapped in a shawl or behind two layers of face mask. But I will be followed by searing eyes, X-raying me. Because here, it is culturally acceptable for men to gape at women unblinkingly, as if we are all in a staring contest that nobody told half the population about, a contest hinged on a subtle form of psychological violence. ""Wolves,"" my friend, Maryam, called them, as she recounted the time a man grazed her shoulder as he sped by on a motorbike. ""From now on, I am going to stare back, make them uncomfortable."" Maryam runs a company that takes tourists to the mountainous north. ""People are shocked to see a woman leading tours on her own,"" she told me.

We exchanged hiking stories. We had never encountered a solo female hiker up north. When I hike solo, men, apart from their usual leering, offer unsolicited advice, ask patronizing questions and, on occasion, follow in silence. I pretend to receive a call from my imaginary husband who happens to be nearby and wants to know exactly where I am. Even in the wilderness, you can't escape. Years ago, a friend told me about the time her dad beat her up after he saw her talking to a boy outside school. It wasn't the first time. Until she left for college in the United States, she lived in constant terror of when the next wave of violence would arrive. Her mother stood by and let it happen. Internalized patriarchy rears its head often when aunties (an auntie is any older woman who exists to profess her uninvited opinion) are concerned that you are not married. Aunties emphasize that motherhood is your assigned purpose on this planet. Aunties comment on your body as if you are not there. This country fails its women from the very top of government leadership to those who live with us in our homes. In September, a woman was raped beside a major highway near Lahore, Pakistan's second-largest city. Around 1 a.m., her car ran out of fuel. She called the police and waited. Two armed men broke through the windows and assaulted her in a nearby field. The most senior police official in Lahore remarked that the survivor was assaulted because, he assumed, she ""was traveling late at night without her husband's permission.""

An elderly woman in my apartment building in Islamabad, remarked, ""Apni izzat apnay haath mein"" -- Your honor is in your own hands. In Pakistan, sexual assault comes with stigma, the notion that a woman by being on the receiving end of a violent crime has brought shame to herself and her family. Societal judgment is a major reason survivors don't come forward. Responding to the Lahore assault, Prime Minister Imran Khan proposed chemical castration of the rapists. His endorsement of archaic punishments rather than a sincere promise to undertake the difficult, lengthy and necessary work of reforming criminal and legal procedures is part of the problem. The conviction rate for sexual assault is around 3 percent, according to War Against Rape, a local nonprofit. Mr. Khan's analysis of the prevalence of gender-based violence is even more regressive. Fahashi (indecency) in society is the culprit, deflecting responsibility from the police and government. Mr. Khan blamed Bollywood for widespread incidents of rape in neighboring New Delhi, missing the point that, like Pakistan, India suffers from similar issues with policing, public safety and the judicial system. The highway attack shook the women of Pakistan, but it did not shock us. We grew up with stories of women killed for ""honor"" and women raped for revenge. Women doused with acid and women burned with stoves. Pakistan ranks 164 out of 167 countries on the Women, Peace and Security Index 2019-2020, barely hovering above Yemen, Afghanistan and Syria. In the two months since the highway assault, a police officer raped a woman in her home. A girl was murdered by her cousin and uncle for speaking to a male friend on her phone. A woman waiting for a bus after work was kidnapped and raped. A teenager committed suicide after being blackmailed by the men who raped her and videotaped the assault. A 6-year-old was clubbed to death by her father for making noise. Between January and June alone, there have been 3,148 reported cases of violence against women and children. Many go unreported. There are slices of Pakistan where a woman can bare her arms, smoke, drink, escape abroad, become a minister. But class does not protect her from the stares and the fears of assault when she ventures outside. Yet for women in the lower socio-economic strata of society, women in rural Pakistan, things are much worse. The insecurity and harassment working-class women face daily at a bus stop are experiences that are foreign to those behind the wheel of a Mercedes. On a recent afternoon, I pulled up to a traffic stop. Twenty or so motorcycles zigzagged their way up to right under the light, as they commonly do here. The riders were men. With one exception. I noticed her only because the men around her were consuming her. It's rare to see women driving bikes in Pakistan -- probably because when they do, they're on display. Although she had her back to me, face obscured by a helmet, I imagined her staring resolutely ahead, pushing through the discomfort, the sheer creepiness, of being watched. A wave of fury passed over me. Don't let the bastards grind you down, I tried to telepathically transmit to her, a refrain from ""The Handmaid's Tale"" that frequently floats through my head when I'm back here.

Real Estate,Jody L. Kriss,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/realestate/commercial/jody-l-kriss.html,"Mr. Kriss, 38, is a founder and principal of East River Partners, a company based in New York that acquires and redevelops brownstone properties in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Before starting East River, Mr. Kriss co-founded the Bayrock Group, which developed the Trump SoHo hotel. He started his career at the Athena Group where he managed the development of 838 Fifth Avenue. Q. Tell me a little more about what your company does. A. Mostly we started redeveloping buildings, often gut-renovations, and even more specific than that, they're all ""brownstones."" I use brownstones in quotations, because it's not all brown brick. They're on four- or five-story scale in brownstone neighborhoods in Brooklyn and Manhattan. Every building is at least 100 years old.

Q. How many projects are you working? A. Eight. We have two that are complete, two that will be completed in the next 30 days and four that are in the pipeline. We looked at a lot of distressed opportunities in '08 and '09 and into 2010, thinking it would be a long time before we became developers again because of all the distress out there, and that you could just buy things that were unfinished or almost finished. But around 2010 it occurred to us that we were going to be developers much sooner than we thought. The distressed opportunities never materialized for us. Q. Let's talk about some of your projects, starting with one in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn. A. That's 364 Union Street. It just went on the market. There are five units -- four are three-bedroom two-bath, and then there's one garden duplex that has a private yard. Q. What are you getting per square foot? Q. Another new development is 371 Sixth Avenue in Park Slope, Brooklyn. A. It's also just coming on the market. It's a four-family. Q. And the prices per square foot there?

Q. Can you talk about some of your projects in the pipeline? A. Another one is in Park Slope. It's 26 feet wide and on 10th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. We're doing four units there, but they're going to be larger, starting at 1,550 square feet. All of them will be three beds or larger. It'll be on the market next year.

And then we have an interesting project that we already started construction on -- we started construction on both of these, actually -- it's at 415 East Sixth Street in Manhattan and it's a synagogue. It's the last remaining tenement synagogue in the East Village and the Landmarks Preservation Commission has approved the project. We're keeping the synagogue on the ground floor and building three loft apartments above. Q. Would you consider doing larger projects? A. Sure. The ones I've mentioned so far are the last of our pipeline of smaller ones. And then we're doing one on 86th between Broadway and West End. We have three contiguous row houses and so we're in the process of redeveloping those. We're in the Landmarks approval process. We anticipate starting construction before the end of the year. They'll be larger, family-size units -- around 10. A. We'll be doing larger projects and taking on larger challenges as time moves on, and that'll definitely include some rentals. Q. Much of what you're doing seems geared to middle-class buyers. A. I would say there's something aspirational about it, about living in these brownstones. But it's also really affordable for a lot of families, by New York standards.

By far, the hardest part of our job is creating the product; the easier part is selling it. There's no question that there's an extraordinary amount of demand for these brownstones and virtually no competition when we bring them to market. Q. How do you find properties to develop? A. We've just been vigilant about calling everyone in town who we think could have an opportunity for us. New York is a town where you have to move very, very quickly on every opportunity. We used to be buying the building for $250 to $300 a foot; now we're buying the land for $250 to $300 a foot. Having a fund is a big advantage, because the one thing you don't have to do is raise the money while you're doing your investigation. Q. The fund is a main source for financing. Who invests there? A. A lot of finance people; I can't give you their names. We just have one fund -- it's $12 million. Q. Do you live in a project you developed? A. No, I live in a Related building on the Upper West Side. We rent a condo from one of the unit owners. A. I just never got around to buying.","Mr. Kriss is a founder and principal of East River Partners, a company based in New York that acquires and redevelops brownstone properties in Manhattan and Brooklyn.",5b1b2419-30cc-5556-b93a-428e983e4487,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/09/business/INTERVIEW/INTERVIEW-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=767&w=600&s=4019d84e19621a9d82f14e6baf6d026862f4092beaf62fe7073ae65ce398c694&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Jody L.

This weekend I have ... an hour, and I don't believe in love In ""Love Fraud,"" a group of women seek justice against the same man. When to watch: Sunday at 9 p.m., on Showtime For two decades, women say, Richard Scott Smith romanced them, married them, then took what little money they had. In this four-part documentary series, from the directors Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady, several fleeced ladies hire Carla, a grizzled female bounty hunter, to track him down. After hearing their stories, she offers her services pro bono. ""If Richard Scott Smith came in and robbed me like he did these other women, I'd be in prison,"" Carla rasps. ""I'd have slit his throat and watched him bleed to death."" A tale of crab cakes and treachery, set mostly in Kansas, it's less lurid than ""Dirty John,"" another recent series based around a fraudster, but maybe more seductive in its twisty structure and unpeeling of multiple layers of deceit. In the early episodes, Carla and her clients try to track Smith down. Later, other mysteries emerge. ... 90 minutes, and I want to bust somebody Phineas and Ferb return in a new movie. 'Phineas and Ferb the Movie: Candace Against the Universe' When to watch: Premieres Friday on Disney+ In a rare upside of the Covid-19 lockdowns, my kids have discovered ""Phineas and Ferb,"" a semiprecious gem of a Disney series about two S.T.E.M.-adept stepbrothers and the teen sister always trying to catch them in the act. It's smart and dumb in all the best ways, and there are musical numbers, too. The series wrapped up in 2015, after 222 episodes, but its creators have now briefly revived it. In this movie, Candace accidentally blasts onto another planet and it's up to her brothers -- with a possible assist from a spacewalking platypus -- to rescue her. (Assuming she even wants to be rescued ... and who says she can't rescue herself?) The movie probably works better if you know the show well and can enjoy the formula beats and the jaunty callbacks. But it will likely delight the uninitiated, too, especially when Ali Wong shows up to voice the alien baddie. ... a few hours (maybe more for the preshow), and I want my MTV The Weeknd will be among the performers at the 2020 MTV Video Music Awards. When to watch: Sunday at 8 p.m., on MTV In a moment when live performance is either illegal or a really bad idea, the MTV Video Music Awards are a nice reminder that music has been enjoyed remotely since phonographs were high-tech. Still, the logistics for the 2020 ceremony have skittered around like a middle-aged dad trying to do the Toosie Slide. Originally scheduled to take place in the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, the event will now unfold in outdoor locations across New York's five boroughs. Then last week J Balvin, who contracted Covid-19, and Roddy Ricch announced that they would not appear. So what will Sunday's broadcast include? Keke Palmer as host, some new categories, like Best Music Video from Home and Best Quarantine Performance, plus performances by Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande and The Weeknd, who are all up for the Video of the Year award.

Real Estate,"In a Pandemic, Creative and Mostly Virtual Socializing",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/realestate/quarantine-activities.html,"Indira Mahabir was scrolling on Facebook late one March night when an ad popped up. It was for Society Las Olas, a new apartment community in downtown Fort Lauderdale, Fla. with low rents and an emphasis on community and social events. Ms. Mahabir, 47, is single, with two adult children, ages 27 and 22. She had been empty-nesting in her four-bedroom home for over a year, and was ready for a change. Society Las Olas, which was still being built, ticked all the boxes: rents started at $1,100; the 34-story tower would have a pool, gym, and a packed calendar of mixers, lectures and classes, all designed to help neighbors meet and mingle. Covid-19 has been a wrench for many residential communities and their social calendars, canceling everything that couldn't move outdoors or online. But for some, it has been an opportunity, inspiring innovative programming that has served as a lifeline through the lockdown for residents, and even helped attract new tenants in the process. By the time Ms. Mahabir signed a lease, Society Las Olas's social calendar had been scrapped, a casualty of Covid-19. But she still chose to move in, and calls riding out the pandemic there one of the best decisions she has ever made. The reason? The property reworked much of its pandemic programming from scratch, focusing on enhancing community, even from six feet apart.

""We have been significantly challenged when interacting is the one thing you can't do,"" said Ryan Shear, managing partner of PMG, a developer with several ""social communities,"" including Society Las Olas, in its portfolio. ""We really had to pivot."" That pivot includes Taco Tuesdays, where residents receive packages from a local taqueria; they build their tacos in their apartments and eat them ""together"" via Instagram livestream. There are sound bowl healing classes, socially distanced by the pool; and virtual panels on current events like the future of Florida's hospitality sector. All are free for residents. Planned events this winter include a pop-up art gallery, with artists painting live in the lobby; and an ""Around the World"" food expo spread across several floors of the building. For Ms. Mahabir, the shared experiences have been essential. ""If I had still been in my house, I think it would have been very depressing to be in such an environment, alone, going through the pandemic,"" she said. Many event programmers said they felt a sense of responsibility to their residents to create an outlet and safe space during a time of heightened anxiety. ""The outside world doesn't work very well right now, so we really have to create our own inside world,"" said Michael Fazio, chief creative officer at LIVunLtd, which runs events for a number of apartment towers in New York City, including Gotham West, the Nicole, the Atlas and the Ashland, all owned by the Gotham Organization. Mr. Fazio knew when he canceled in-person programming that his residents still wanted engagement. The challenge was offering something unique in a virtual world swimming with free content.

So rather than a standard zoom happy hour, he created a series of weekly wine-tasting zoom happy hours, each with a themed wine list curated by a sommelier from Sotheby's Wine. The themes were simple: One week focused on California reds, another on wines under $50, and attendees swirled and sampled the wines, which were delivered to each participant beforehand, online together. Mr. Fazio hosted a story program that families could enjoy together, utilizing performers from Drag Queen Story Hour, who offered virtual readings of stories like ""Go Away Big Green Monster"" and ""The Kindness Book."" And he planned a trivia night, and bumped it up by bringing in quizmaster Noah Tarnow, of The Big Quiz Thing, to oversee the action. The events have been popular with the company's young, technology-driven New York renters. And because the virtual events are open to Gotham's entire portfolio of buildings, attendance has been higher than typical in-person events, which are limited to the renters in the property where it takes place. But what if residents don't know how to log onto the computer, or don't have access to one? That was the question at RiseBoro, a New York City nonprofit, whose portfolio includes senior centers and 3,000 units of affordable housing. With all in-person programming paused at their senior centers in March, they decided to try something they had never done before -- put content online. Designing the programming, said Sandy Christian, vice president of RiseBoro's senior division, wasn't the challenge. They started with yoga, Zumba, theology lectures and nutrition classes, via Zoom or YouTube. But many seniors in their network don't have tablets or laptops, and those who did had trouble working them. Early in the lockdown, in-person IT visits were impossible. So they went analog, calling seniors on the phone. Those who did have tablets were given free coaching sessions with computer instructors; those who didn't were able to dial in to events via conference lines. Today, some classes, including a popular Friday virtual dance party with music like salsa, merengue and rhythm & blues, get as many as 200 participants.

Sallie Ann Robinson, a cookbook author and celebrity chef, grew up on Daufuskie Island in South Carolina, part of the dwindling Gullah Geechee community that descended from Africans once enslaved there. Today, the majority of Daufuskie's residents live in Haig Point, a private community with many million-dollar homes. Ms. Robinson, whose nickname is ""The Gullah Diva,"" headlined a virtual fund-raiser and concert on Oct. 26, the concept was dreamed up only after the pandemic hit. From her perch on a waterfront kitchen at the Haig Point deck, she cooked recipes from her childhood like sweet potato cornbread and chicken and vegetable stew; attendees followed along in their own kitchens. The event raised $90,000. The majority is earmarked for food outreach for South Carolina families facing Covid-19 hardship; a portion will also go directly to the Gullah community. The event wouldn't have happened outside of a pandemic, she says, and presented a unique opportunity for connection. ""Food opens the door to the heart, body and soul,"" she said. ""That's life -- everything bad ain't bad. Sometimes it's for good reasons and we don't see it until it happens."" And Maggie Lang, vice president of marketing and experience for Daydream Apartments in the western United States, designed ""Crisis Pickles and Immunity Cocktails,"" which combined a mixology class with a discussion on racial justice. She also hosted a town hall with senior representatives from the Equal Justice Initiative, which works to end mass incarceration; next up is a presentation with a James Beard-winning chef on the origins of soul food.","With Covid looming again, some rental buildings are creating programming that is safe and also captures the imaginations of tenants.",e94471e4-c772-5223-aaad-ddaa469c9d0d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/realestate/01activities/01activities-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Indira Mahabir moved into Society Las Olas, a new apartment community in downtown Fort Lauderdale, Fla. early this year in part because of its social calendar.

Real Estate,The Art of Remaking a Downtown,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/15/realestate/new-jersey-in-the-region-the-art-of-remaking-orange.html,"A PAIR of New York architects describe the plan they have conceptualized for remaking downtown Orange as something that will ""rewrite both the physical and social spaces of Orange."" Township officials, on the other hand, compare it to what ""you could see in a third-world country"" and say it's ""not really grounded in reality."" Certainly, at this point, any such remake is far from being realized. In fact, it exists only as a component in an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Keeping company with towns in Oregon, Florida, Illinois and California, Orange is the focus of a show called ""Foreclosed: Rehousing the American Dream."" In preparation last summer, the museum matched up teams of architects, planners, ecologists and engineers with each of the chosen communities, asking them to re-envision the ailing urban/suburban model. The results are on display at MoMA through Aug. 13. Led by Michael Meredith and Hilary Sample, partners at MOS Architects in New York, the team that took on Orange concentrated on the half-mile radius around the main train station. They came up with a campuslike pedestrian village that replaces many streets with connected ribbons of four-story mixed-use buildings and an energy-producing rooftop park. Titled ""Thoughts on a Walking City,"" the plan also tries to address the problem of obesity by adding bike paths and replacing elevators and escalators with stairs.

""The idea was that there's this poor, disenfranchised group that's paying for infrastructure they're not using,"" said Mr. Meredith, describing his and his colleagues' thought process after a tour last year. ""So we asked, 'What if we rethink the streets?' The street is seen as this place of freedom, and yet it is incredibly polluted, it takes a lot of capital to maintain, it's filled with private interests. It's even illegal to stand there for too long."" Predictably, the notion of cutting off thoroughfares didn't go over well with leaders. ""That may be perfect for a utopian society where there's no crime, no fires, no issues,"" said Mayor Eldridge Hawkins Jr. ""But how would you get fire trucks and emergency vehicles in there? It doesn't make any sense."" Yet Orange not only has a good deal of crime and fire, but also a sizable population of poor and disenfranchised residents: 18.8 percent of its 30,134 people live below the poverty line, according to 2010 census numbers. Recognizing that the city has its challenges, the Hawkins administration has tried to tackle issues like decrepit public housing and blocks of boarded-up homes, in what it considers a more measured response than the architects' radical vision. On a recent bus tour with a reporter, the mayor and his team were eager to point out the reality of the area they call ""the heart of Orange.""

Joseph Portelli, an assistant vice president of RPM, said the company expected to break ground on the first building by the end of this year. Planned for a parking lot the city leases to the Postal Service, it will have a 175-space parking garage for residents and commuters, along with a wellness center that may include a health clinic and a gym. The $28 million first building is being financed by a federal tax credit program, state and local funds, a $13 million private mortgage and $4 million from RPM, Mr. Portelli said. The RPM group recently completed Grand Central Housing, a 70-unit affordable building elsewhere in Orange. One goal is to tie Tony Galento Plaza more closely into city life, which mostly takes place a block north, on bustling Main Street. And while they're at it, city planners are seeking to improve the quality of the shops along the two-mile stretch of Main Street. Storefronts are already occupied, but ultimately the city would like to attract a major supermarket chain to the area, which Stephanie Gidigbi, Mayor Hawkins's chief of staff, calls a ""food desert."" Progress is more evident south of the train tracks, where residents have begun moving into the new Walter G. Alexander Homes: 48 units for older residents and 66 affordable town homes, which replace the seven-story public projects that were the scourge of Orange until 2010, when they were demolished. ""There was lots of crime, drugs, guns,"" Mayor Hawkins said, ""but the good people were suffering, they had no control over their lives."" To bankroll this $27 million project, the city took advantage of the state's Neighborhood Stabilization Program and other tax credits. And to stabilize this East Ward neighborhood, the part of town hit hardest by the foreclosure crisis, it is also looking to add market-rate housing to the mix, as well as offering home-improvement money to owners of some of the single-family houses. There was never any interaction between city officials and the MoMA project team, either during the research phase last year or since the exhibition opened in February. Yet Orange officials are willing to admit that the architects got some things right.",An exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art envisions a new downtown Orange as a campuslike pedestrian village.,02751848-54ca-5c63-a238-ee94baffd997,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/15/realestate/15NJZONE1_SPAN/15NJZONE1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=edba0b5607203d5b97504517859dbb33cf448df6b15a48d08e4ab8c63fe33be6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,HEART OF ORANGE  Mayor Eldridge Hawkins Jr. at the new Walter G.

Television,"With 'Rise,' a 'Friday Night Lights' for Theater Kids",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/09/arts/television/rise-nbc-rosie-perez-josh-radnor.html,"Josh Radnor stood backstage in a Brooklyn auditorium. Breathing: audible. Expression: agonized. ""Please let this not suck,"" he whispered. Mr. Radnor, best known as the I in ""How I Met Your Mother,"" was in character on this late December day as Lou Mazzuchelli, or Mr. Mazzu, the high school drama teacher at the center of ""Rise,"" the midseason NBC show that debuts on March 13. Based on ""Drama High,"" Michael Sokolove's 2013 nonfiction book about the visionary Levittown, Pa., teacher Lou Volpe, the first 10-episode season follows the permanently rumpled Lou from the moment he lands the drama job, beating out Rosie Perez's better-qualified fellow teacher, to the opening night of his first musical: ""Spring Awakening."" Another man might have started out with something easier, perhaps a ""Bye Bye Birdie"" or a ""Seussical."" Not Lou. ""Which part did you like best?"" Ms. Perez's Tracey Wolfe asks bitingly. ""The abortion, the teen suicide or the incest?"" This goes a long way to explaining Lou's backstage prayer. Given the high school setting, the ingenue cast and some show tunes, you're forgiven for thinking that ""Rise"" sounds a lot like ""Glee,"" the Ryan Murphy glitterbomb about a show choir that ran on Fox from 2009 to 2015. The showrunner of ""Rise,"" Jason Katims (""Friday Night Lights,"" ""Parenthood"") likes ""Glee."" He likes ""High School Musical."" He wanted to do something different.

""Rise"" began when the theater producer Jeffrey Seller (""Hamilton""), now making his first foray into series TV, read an excerpt from ""Drama High"" in The New York Times Magazine in 2013. He bought the book. It made him cry. But the rights had already been sold. A few years later, when he'd joined up with the veteran producer Flody Suarez (""8 Simple Rules,"" ""The Tick""), he learned that those rights were again available. ""I handed Flody the book and I said, 'This is what I want to make into a TV show,'"" Mr. Seller recalled. At the same time, Mr. Katims had been looking for a new project, another way of ""dropping down into the middle of a town and living in that town,"" he said. He'd been pitched soccer shows, baseball shows, other football shows. He'd declined them all. But a show built around a high school drama program, that he could work with. (In fairness, there is a surprising amount of football in ""Rise."" Old habits.) He and the producers decided that unlike a ""Glee"" or a ""Smash"" or a ""Fame,"" ""Rise"" wouldn't be slick or satirical. There would be no fabulous guest stars (""I don't picture Cher showing up,"" Mr. Suarez said with a deadpan) and the kids wouldn't be mistaken for professionals.

""We really wanted to make it feel like these were real kids,"" Mr. Katims said. ""That some of them struggle with acting and struggle with lines and struggle with pitch."" Work on ""Spring Awakening"" occupies the entire first season and it takes more episodes than you'd think before the kids start singing in any goosebump-inducing way. (If the show is picked up, the fall episodes will work toward a play, the spring episodes toward a musical.)

At the Greenpoint studio, the set crew has built a soundstage of a real high school auditorium in Westchester, detail-perfect down to the nubbly red seats and worn carpeting. The actors fooling around between takes looked a lot like actual high school actors, singing to themselves as they pulled up their knee socks and fixed their hair. ""It's how young we are,"" Damon J. Gillespie, 23, who plays a heartthrob tenor, joked. ""We haven't been ruined yet."" Auli'i Cravalho, the 17-year-old ""Moana"" star who plays a student with a troubled home life, felt that the show echoed her own teenage experiences. ""The characters are growing and evolving and changing all season,"" she said. ""It feels authentic.""

No one would accuse ""Rise,"" set in a fictional Rust Belt town, of glossing over teen issues. ""We deal with issues of class, we deal with issues of teenage pregnancy, we deal with sexual abuse,"" Mr. Katims said. Does that mean that ""Rise"" might be too real? ""It's a show that is very uplifting,"" he promised. During the Television Critics Association Press Tour in January, Mr. Katims kicked up an internet fuss when he revealed that in one instance he'd departed from real life, changing the character of Lou from a closeted gay man, which Lou Volpe was for many years, to a straight one. Mr. Katims told me that in setting the show in 2018, the story of a closeted man would depend on ""cliches that didn't feel quite honest for what was our experience today.""

One person who doesn't mind this change: Mr. Volpe. ""I had been married for 21 years before I came out,"" he wrote in an email, ""and I enjoyed a full and rich life with my wife and son."" Mr. Volpe also wrote he hopes that ""Rise"" will show that theater is a place where teens who will never go on to Broadway careers can ""test the waters of their creativity, take artistic risks."" Maybe other risks, too. As a New Yorker article recently noted, several leaders of the Never Again gun control movement are theater kids. And in May several of them are starring in a local production of ""Spring Awakening."" As Mr. Mazzu says in the second episode, ""Our students need a place to express themselves, laugh, cry, exalt in joy, and most of all to dream, to dream big, to discover the greatness within them, because in my heart I do believe that everyone of these kids has greatness inside them."" To create more of those places, Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment and a former theater kid, helped establish R.I.S.E. (Recognizing and Inspiring Student Expression) America, a program that will award $10,000 grants to 50 high school theater programs.

That's meaningful to many of the show's stars, like Mr. Radnor, a ""pretty insecure high schooler,"" who found confidence through school musicals like ""Oklahoma!"" and ""Cabaret,"" he said. ""It gave me this forward momentum and this sense of purpose in the world that I didn't probably have before,"" he said, speaking on set in Mr. Mazzu's earth-toned living room. For other roles, like the Civil War surgeon he played in PBS's ""Mercy Street,"" he has done tremendous research, but not for this part. ""I understood it in a bone-deep way,"" he said. ""I try to be on set with a certain amount of grace and a lot of gratitude for this role, it feels full circle for me."" Ms. Perez, a former ward of the state, also credits her success to school arts programs and engaged teachers. As an adult, she helped to found Urban Arts Partnership, which works with underserved public schools to introduce arts-integrated curriculums. For her, ""Rise"" is real in all the right ways. She was in tears before she'd even finished the first script. ""My husband goes, 'Oh my God. What's wrong, what's wrong?'"" Ms. Perez recalled. ""And I said, 'I can't believe I received this. I want to do this role. I'm already doing it every day. Except there's not a camera on me.' This is what I believe in.""","NBC's ""Rise,"" isn't ""Glee"" and it isn't ""Fame."" ""The mantra is to always keep it as realistic and honest as possible,"" said its showrunner, Jason Katims.",ed4a66f5-52c9-58f1-a115-c74eabee42e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/11/arts/11rise4alt/merlin_134834781_caa3f767-9bf3-4a9e-b297-6cacd582c744-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=98d2615cb302fffe2f2cdad3d0348ac6deb407e2ad9e955b79a27b8d2ded8d24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In &ldquo;Rise,&rdquo; Josh Radnor, left, plays a high school drama teacher inspired by Lou Volpe, the visionary teacher in Levittown, Pa.",ed4a66f5-52c9-58f1-a115-c74eabee42e1,N24News/imgs/ed4a66f5-52c9-58f1-a115-c74eabee42e1.jpg,3
Music,"In a Hometown Send-Off, Aretha Franklin Belongs to Everyone",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/01/arts/music/aretha-franklin-funeral-detroit.html,"Aretha Franklin's funeral, and a tribute concert the night before, demonstrated how many communities are eager to claim the ""Queen of Soul"" as their own.

DETROIT -- Everybody wants a piece of Aretha Franklin's artistic legacy. Church, state, activism, tradition, innovation and celebrity all vied for recognition in back-to-back marathon homages to the universally admired ""Queen of Soul,"" here in her longtime hometown. Ms. Franklin belonged to the gospel church; she belonged to the pop public; she belonged to the civil rights and women's rights movements; she belonged, emphatically, to Detroit. At her funeral on Friday, the mayor of Detroit, Mike Duggan, made news by announcing a plan to rename Detroit's city-owned riverside amphitheater, Chene Park, as Aretha Franklin Park. ""The mayor just got re-elected,"" quipped the officiant, Bishop Charles H. Ellis III. Yet being a member of her communities -- of faith, of politics, of geography -- wasn't enough to define Aretha Franklin. She also belonged to her family, to her era and to the utterly singular gifts, discipline, ambitions and regal impulses that make her irreplaceable. [Our full report from Aretha Franklin's funeral and its most memorable moments.] On Thursday evening, a concert called ""A People's Tribute to the Queen"" was presented free at Chene Park, with its 6,000 tickets snapped up online in 10 minutes. It stretched to nearly five hours, presenting impressive Detroit locals -- all of whom, it seemed, had been nurtured from birth on Ms. Franklin's music -- alongside nationally known singers.

On Friday morning, invited guests and members of the public packed the Greater Grace Temple megachurch for Ms. Franklin's funeral, billed as ""A Celebration Fit for the Queen"" and lasting eight hours with music, preaching, reminiscences and testimonials. There were speeches from the former president Bill Clinton, the Rev. Al Sharpton, Cicely Tyson, Smokey Robinson, Clive Davis, Tyler Perry and the governor of Michigan, Rick Snyder, among others. And there was music from Stevie Wonder, Gladys Knight, Chaka Khan, Jennifer Hudson and gospel stalwarts like Shirley Caesar and the Clark Sisters. Both the tribute and funeral were live-streamed worldwide. Chaka Khan reached higher and higher notes performing ""Going Up Yonder"" at Ms. Franklin's funeral on Friday. Together, they honored an artist whose roots were deep, widespread and thoroughly acknowledged, but whose vision and achievement were entirely her own: not a template to copy, but an example of hardheaded freedom from an African-American woman who would not be held back by race or gender. ""She was black without apology or excuse,"" the professor and preacher Michael Eric Dyson said at the funeral. ""And she was American without argument or exception."" The tribute concert was divided into genres: classical music (reflecting Ms. Franklin's latter-day dabbling with opera), jazz standards (the beginnings of her major-label career, on Columbia), gospel songs -- complete with a 25-member choir -- and, of course, the pop and R&B hits Ms. Franklin made on Atlantic and Arista Records. The performances were fervent, eager and sometimes spectacular, like Regina Belle's rowdy ""Rock Steady,"" Johnny Gill's aerobatic ""Ain't No Way,"" Dee Dee Bridgewater's boldly declaimed ""Skylark"" and Tasha Page-Lockhart's spiraling, improvisatory ""Amazing Grace"" and later, on the secular side, ""I Never Loved a Man (The Way I Love You).""

At the funeral, classic gospel songs that Ms. Franklin had recorded on her albums shared the lineup with a few pop songs, including ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman,"" deferentially performed by the pop singer with America's current No. 1 album, Ariana Grande. The finale was also a secular song: Stevie Wonder vowing eternal love with ""As."" A funeral is a ritual, not a concert, but with cameras running and a worldwide audience, the performers poured it on: Chaka Khan gliding higher and higher in ""Going Up Yonder"" (while reading lyrics off a strategically carried fan); Shirley Caesar and Tasha Cobbs preaching and exulting in ""How I Got Over,"" Yolanda Adams and Bishop Paul Morton riding oceanic surges in ""Mary Don't You Weep,"" Jennifer Hudson belting and shouting ""Amazing Grace.""

The church claims Ms. Franklin, rightly, as the preacher's daughter who brought everything she had learned from gospel music -- the timing, the dynamics, the ornaments, the vocal tones, the call-and-response with her backup singers, the way she played piano -- into the hits that would make her a star for the next five decades and into her countless live concerts. When Ms. Franklin hit an artistic impasse she would reinvigorate herself by returning to church and recording albums of gospel standards. Ms. Franklin sang gospel at the funerals of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., in 1968, and of Rosa Parks in 2005; Ms. Parks's funeral was also held in the Greater Grace Temple. The continuity was symbolic and unmistakable. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] But the church was only part of Ms. Franklin's education and of the style she would forge. She also grew up hearing jazz, blues and R&B in a home that welcomed visits from touring musicians. And in the 1950s and 1960s her father, like other preachers nationwide, was a civil-rights leader, an ally of Dr. King. Growing up in a segregated era, Ms. Franklin absorbed not only the tenets of faith but also a determination to make earthly life more equitable. At her funeral, there was as much praise for her civil-rights advocacy -- touring to fund Dr. King's payroll, posting bail for Angela Davis in 1970 -- as for her music, while some speakers, like Ms. Franklin's longtime friend the Rev. Jesse Jackson, used the pulpit to get out the vote for this year's midterm elections. Ms. Franklin had to move outside gospel music to become a superstar. Her 1967 breakthrough, after years of working in and out of gospel and jazz, was to bring pop concision and impact -- ""Think"" runs just 2:20 -- to songs that didn't confine her voice or constrain her pride. Through the decades, she kept finding them, writing them, or (as with ""Respect"" and ""I Say a Little Prayer"") seizing them to make them her own. She sang about pain to exorcise it; she sang about strength to spread it. She also made herself an example as a tough businesswoman.

Eulogies at her funeral made clear that Ms. Franklin, unlike some superstars, did not isolate herself from the city where she had grown up. She flaunted furs and gowns onstage, and red-soled Louboutin shoes in her coffin, but she understood what others were going through. A Detroit radio personality, Mildred Gaddis, recalled that Ms. Franklin used to call up a local TV news anchor after seeing segments about families in trouble, then quietly send them a check. Ron Moten, a neighbor, said he had asked Ms. Franklin to visit his mother in an assisted-living home on her 90th birthday; Ms. Franklin told him, ""I'll think about it,"" then showed up with her band to play an hourlong concert for all the residents.

Beyond charity, many of her friends affirmed that with Ms. Franklin, politics was always a topic of discussion. And while direct protest songs are a tiny part of her huge catalog, there was no mistaking -- in her voice, her lyrics and her entire public presentation -- her bedrock message that, as she famously said, ""Everyone wants respect. Everyone needs respect."" There's no formula, no simple set of demographics or allegiances or parameters, to create an artist like Aretha Franklin. Imitating the notes she sang -- as some of her admirers did onstage -- is just technical mimicry, far from her true lesson of creativity. Understanding what shaped Ms. Franklin only underscores how completely she synthesized and then transcended it all. But let the sacred and the secular, the idealistic and the hedonistic, the political and the aesthetic, the local and the global all affirm their part in her music. There's enough for everyone.","The gospel church, the pop public, the city of Detroit: The ""Queen of Soul"" was part of them all, but they didn't define her singular gifts.",df417027-c3fc-52d9-bd7f-5bf6374184d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/03/us/03aretha-alpha/03aretha-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2eb2c181afcf411cba4119d17b7fdd8f83ca4d9a870f2cfb68687d2e0e2c75fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Aretha Franklin's funeral demonstrated how many communities are eager to claim the ""Queen of Soul"" as their own.",df417027-c3fc-52d9-bd7f-5bf6374184d3,N24News/imgs/df417027-c3fc-52d9-bd7f-5bf6374184d3.jpg,12
Your Money,"In Alzheimer's Cases, Financial Ruin and Abuse Are Always Lurking",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/31/your-money/in-alzheimers-cases-financial-ruin-and-abuse-are-always-lurking.html,"MIDWAY through the film ""Still Alice,"" which tracks the growing grip of Alzheimer's on a 50-something Columbia University professor, that professor, played by Julianne Moore, stands at a lectern to address an Alzheimer's conference. She is holding a yellow highlighter and a copy of her speech. She proceeds to talk about her struggles with the disease and how she never knows what will vanish from her memory and when. It's a lucid, affecting talk, and the viewer would be hard pressed to know anything was wrong with her, if not for the highlighter. She uses it to track her every word so she doesn't read the same sentence over and over again. For anyone who has ever watched a family member disappear into Alzheimer's, Ms. Moore's performance is gripping, particularly as her tricks to stall her decline inevitably fail and the later stages of the disease consume her. Yet the movie is also a great vessel to explore many of the financial issues that families need to address when someone is diagnosed with Alzheimer's or any other disease that causes cognitive impairment.

Ms. Moore's character has one big advantage over many people who get Alzheimer's. She and her husband, played by Alec Baldwin, are affluent. They teach at Columbia and have raised three children in what looks like a brownstone near campus. One child is in medical school, another in law school and a third, to the chagrin of her mother, has moved to Los Angeles to become an actress. When she grows concerned over her own forgetfulness, she has the wherewithal to be seen by a top neurologist. She thinks she has a brain tumor; after a series of tests she finds out it's Alzheimer's -- a diagnosis she hears about in her husband's presence. But stories from financial advisers indicate other families are not so fortunate. Thomas Mingone, managing partner at Capital Management Group of New York, said he had clients whose mental slide had been apparent to the advisers, accountants and lawyers in the room but not to the client. Since advisers are bound by a fiduciary duty to protect their clients' privacy, Mr. Mingone said he can't simply call up their children to let them know. With a client who seems to be slipping but lives alone and sees family members infrequently, Mr. Mingone said he suggests a family meeting, which allows him to connect with his client's children. Other times, he said, just asking clients how they are doing brings the problem out. ""Sometimes when you bring this up with clients, it's a relief to them,"" he said. Once the family is brought in -- if there is a family -- legal documents can be tended to and the family's ability to manage Alzheimer's care can be assessed.

In the film, Ms. Moore's character gets bad reviews for her teaching and is confronted by her department chairman. She tells him she has Alzheimer's; a few scenes later, she and her husband are on a beach and she appears to be receiving disability payments. It's not always this easy. Not everyone has disability or long-term care insurance; even those who do may not have enough. Advisers encourage people to buy it, but it costs thousands of dollars a year. Short of having that coverage, an up-to-date estate plan with a durable power of attorney and relevant health care documents is essential. ""It's not that people don't have an estate plan,"" said Richard A. Behrendt, director of estate planning at Annex Wealth Management. ""It's that it's a will that was done 20 years ago when their kids were 3 and 5. It's not about who's going to get your stuff. It's 'If I can't communicate it's going to be tough to make decisions with my health care providers.'"" And part of that conversation, Mr. Behrendt said, should be pointing out that nursing home care for an Alzheimer's patient can run around $80,000 a year and last for a decade or more, depending on the person's age. In ""Still Alice,"" Julianne Moore portrays a college professor who learns she has Alzheimer's disease. ""You can have someone with a pretty sizable retirement account that just gets wiped out by an illness like this,"" he said. ""Less than 10 percent of adult Americans have some long-term care insurance."" Then there are the family dynamics. Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive of the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, N.Y., said of his three brothers: ""Each of us has different parents. They happen to be the same people -- unless we describe them.""

That dynamic is on display in ""Still Alice"": The daughter in law school is married and has twins after struggling to conceive; the son is in medical school; the daughter acting in Los Angeles keeps her distance from both and seems to get along best with her father. Of course, that siblings fight and harbor grudges from childhood is news to no one. But those adult children also don't always respect their parents' wishes. Consider when a person with Alzheimer's wants to have a say in when he or she dies. Ms. Moore's character makes a video instructing her future debilitated self on how to take pills hidden in her drawer to commit suicide. The carefully detailed plan is the product of a lucid mind, something she no longer possesses when she later finds the video. Her effort fails when she is interrupted and forgets what she was doing. William Zabel, a leading trusts and estates lawyer and a founding partner of the law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel, said it was difficult for people in the United States to chose dignified death on their terms. One of his clients wanted him to be with her when she took her own life at the Carlyle Hotel in Manhattan, he said. But doing so would have led to his disbarment. But after the request, a lawyer at his firm put together a 21-page memo on right-to-die laws around the world. It is a difficult subject, and not just because of the moral issues. There are the logistics beyond the actual act. How, for example, would someone with Alzheimer's get to a country that allows assisted suicide when he or she has only moments of lucidity, or find a doctor in the United States who might administer a strong dose of morphine? His firm's memo includes a ""dementia provision,"" where people can elect that a list of life-sustaining treatments be withheld and ask that their wishes regarding the end of their lives be upheld. It's a strongly worded statement, but Mr. Zabel said it might not hold up in court, particularly in states like New York where withholding food and water from a person is illegal. ""In one case, I filmed the decedent about why he wanted to die in a dignified way,"" Mr. Zabel said. ""Just writing a letter is not the same as seeing it on film, particularly where there are family members who particularly religious and particularly not. You get into this moral quandary of assisted suicide versus dignified death.""","The film ""Still Alice"" focuses attention on a disease that can devastate families emotionally and financially.",9ebc61cd-d65d-5471-a39d-0728feaa53aa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/31/business/31WEALTH1/31WEALTH1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=8ab41842c59533cf0c03287ddbd206fdd3bf36a04068cd119ff3c599c5f8c4cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daniel Reingold, president and chief executive of the Hebrew Home in Riverdale, N.Y.

Style,Ziwe Fumudoh Asks: 'How Many Black People Do You Know?',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/09/style/ziwe-fumudoh-asks-how-many-black-people-do-you-know.html,"How many Black friends do you have? Is it ""between four and five?"" If so, then you have something in common with several guests on 's Instagram Live show. In it, she interviews people who have been canceled -- meaning that their personal views, whether political or artistic, are no longer welcome -- but she also interviews comedians and people who serve as mouthpieces for pop culture like Jeremy O. Harris, an actor and playwright. Ms. Fumudoh, a comedian who goes professionally by just her first name, is still figuring out her guest roster. Her last two interviews in particular have made the show indelible. She asks her white guests questions about race that often reveal their ignorance or self-involvement. This can include straightforward questions, like ""How many Black people do you know?"" and more complicated ones, like ""Did your family own slaves?"" There's also the fraught but impossible, including: ""When you say Black people, do you capitalize the B?""

Caroline Calloway, a faux-chaotic Instagram figure powered by her privilege and moored by her manufactured anarchy, was a recent guest. She has been canceled many times -- once for charging $165 to attend her ""creativity workshops"" and then again when her ghostwriter revealed the details of their tumultuous friendship. Another recent guest, Alison Roman, is a cookbook author and food personality who took on damage to her budding career when she insulted Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo, two Asian women, in an interview. (Ms. Roman is a columnist for The New York Times; the column is on temporary leave.) ""It's just thinking, 'What is the most absurd hyperbolic question that I can confront someone with and how do I make them look me in the eyes and either say an answer or not say anything at all?'"" Ms. Fumudoh said. It's reasonable to wonder why many would agree to such an interview. Ms. Fumudoh, 28, said she doesn't know why her guests do the interviews, either. She books them simply by asking. When she asked Ms. Calloway to come on her show -- because she attended Phillips Exeter Academy, Ms. Fumudoh's rival high school in New Hampshire -- she called it a ""long shot."" When Ms. Calloway agreed, Ms. Fumudoh was surprised. ""It was never a long plan to book Caroline Calloway on the show,"" Ms. Fumudoh said. ""She stands in contrast to a lot of my other guests, who are comedians that I know and perform with in New York.""

In their interviews, Ms. Calloway and Ms. Roman appear candid with their responses and comfortable with the line of questioning -- save for the moment when Ms. Roman's face flushes after being asked how many Black friends she has. The entire interview feels like an intimate conversation between two people that we are allowed to listen in on. Ms. Fumudoh comes off as inviting, funny, honest and warm and also smart and no-nonsense. When Ms. Fumudoh interviewed the actress Rose McGowan, a prominent figure in the #MeToo movement who accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault, Ms. McGowan sounded as if she was talking to a long-lost friend. When Ms. Calloway requests an ""ally cookie"" for buying books from a Black-owned bookstore, Ms. Fumudoh is stern and sincere when she responds: ""There are no cookies in this game."" ""Ultimately I'm not trying to make any of my guests look bad,"" Ms. Fumudoh said. ""I'm just trying to start a really productive and healthy conversation that promotes healing with the trauma that is our racist history of this country."" The point of the show is not to chastise people that have been publicly canceled, Ms. Fumudoh said. For her, the most interesting thing about the show is the comments she gets, particularly people saying, ""I listened to those Ziwe questions and I've thought about how I would answer them."" One thing Ms. Fumudoh, who studied African-American studies, film and poetry at Northwestern University, wants to be clear about is that she is not calling anyone racist or demonizing them. She finds racism against Black women to be the biggest obstacle in her life and wants to contribute toward positive change and healing. ""I don't want to position myself as a racial authority because that's not who I am,"" she said. ""I am just a Black woman who is an artist in 2020 during one of the biggest civil rights fights of a generation.""

Larry Wilmore, a comedian with deep credentials doing difficult work about race (he was the ""senior Black correspondent"" on ""The Daily Show"" and helped create ""Insecure"" with Issa Rae), said that Ms. Fumudoh has mastered awkwardness in conversations about race in a way he hasn't seen before. ""It's kind of a racial high-wire act having that kind of conversation,"" Mr. Wilmore said. ""She seems generous in her approach too, which is nice, but yet there's something else going on there. There's a twinkle behind her eye that makes you go, 'What is she doing here exactly?'"" Her interviews are more of a wink to people who expect Ms. Calloway and Ms. Roman to respond to the questions as they did, according to Mr. Wilmore. In 2016, when he hosted the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner, he was criticized for calling President Obama a racist slur; that was a risky wink. ""I took a lot of blowback from that,"" Mr. Wilmore said. ""But the people who understood it, there was a lot of praise and support for it."" Ms. Fumudoh's wink is aimed more at Black women who feel awkward and uncomfortable all the time simply because they are navigating the world. She makes the discomfort visible and shareable by all. ""This is my way of seizing my authority and my autonomy,"" she said, ""and pushing that back onto society and saying, 'Hey, I'm not going to be the only one who's going through this life feeling discomfort.'""","The comedian performs a kind of racial high wire act on her Instagram Live show, but she really just wants to heal.",1699df3f-8b7d-53eb-9f02-920916041619,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/fashion/09ZIWE-prmo/09ZIWE-prmo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=46a4e6f8af7951edffe89dda1f0b5589e881e7ed23cfe39af5f292a0f90da066&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ziwe Fumudoh,1699df3f-8b7d-53eb-9f02-920916041619,N24News/imgs/1699df3f-8b7d-53eb-9f02-920916041619.jpg,15
Science,"Doctor on Video Screen Told a Man He Was Near Death, Leaving Relatives Aghast",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/science/telemedicine-ethical-issues.html,"Catherine Quintana's father had been in and out of a hospital for weeks, and the family understood that his time was running out. Her 78-year-old father, Ernest Quintana, had lung disease and was struggling to breathe on his own. On March 3, he was admitted to a Kaiser Permanente hospital in Fremont, Calif., for the third time in 15 days, Ms. Quintana said. He had his wife of nearly six decades and other members of his family at his side. While they awaited the results of a CT scan, Ms. Quintana, 54, and her mother decided they would quickly go home to shower. Ms. Quintana's daughter Annalisia Wilharm stayed at his bedside. Ms. Wilharm, 33, said a tall machine on wheels eventually rolled into the room. Attached was a screen streaming a live video of a doctor wearing a headset.

""I just figured it was routine,"" Ms. Wilharm said on Saturday. ""I didn't think he'd get his death sentence here."" The doctor on the screen said there was serious damage to Mr. Quintana's lungs. ""Unfortunately, there's nothing we can treat very effectively,"" he said, according to a video recording that Ms. Wilharm shot on her cellphone to later share details of the conversation with her family. The doctor suggested giving Mr. Quintana morphine, although that could make breathing even more difficult. When the question of hospice care came up, the doctor shared a grim outlook: ""I don't know if he's going to get home."" Throughout the conversation, Mr. Quintana was having trouble hearing the doctor, Ms. Wilharm said. She said the machine was on the side of her father's deaf ear, so she had to repeat the doctor's news. ""I wanted to throw up. It felt like someone took the air out of me,"" she said. ""I said, 'Do you want the morphine?' He looked at me like, 'What choice do I have?'""

When Ms. Quintana and her mother returned to the hospital, the family was furious that Mr. Quintana was told via video conference that he did not have long to live. ""It should have been a human,"" said Ms. Quintana, his daughter. ""It should've been a doctor who came up to his bedside."" Mr. Quintana died on Tuesday, two days after the conversation with the doctor, she said. Telemedicine is an increasingly popular tool in the health care industry. Experts said it was expanding access to care in rural areas while also allowing patients to communicate with specialists they would not ordinarily be able to reach. But in situations like the one involving the Quintana family, in which doctors were communicating sensitive information about end-of-life treatment, health care providers may have to modify their approach in response to patients and their families, John Banja, a medical ethicist with Emory University in Atlanta, said on Saturday. In those cases, Professor Banja said, telemedicine technology may not be sensitive enough to pick up nuanced social cues, like body language and tone of voice, in an emotionally charged moment. In response to the Quintanas' situation, Dr. Barbara L. McAneny, president of the American Medical Association, said that delivering bad news electronically should be a doctor's ""last choice."" ""We should all remember the power of touch -- simple human contact -- can communicate caring better than words,"" she said.

Michelle Gaskill-Hames, the senior vice president for Kaiser in southern Alameda County, said in a statement that the hospital's doctors and nurses had been communicating regularly with Mr. Quintana and his family since he arrived at the hospital. The video conference with the doctor that night was a follow-up to earlier in-person visits by other medical staff, Ms. Gaskill-Hames said, and his initial diagnosis was not communicated via video. It is unclear where the doctor on the video screen was physically located. Telemedicine technology allows small hospitals to have critical care physicians available at all hours, Ms. Gaskill-Hames said, adding that a nurse or another doctor was always in the room at Kaiser to explain the purpose of the technology to a patient. ""We don't support or encourage the use of technology to replace the personal interactions between our patients and their care teams,"" she said. The doctor in the video was not identified, and Catherine Quintana said she had not seen him before. The American Medical Association's ethical code for telemedicine raises possible ethical issues apart from a loss of intimacy in a patient-doctor relationship, such as data security. Although it may sound futuristic, telemedicine is not a new practice in health care, said Dr. Shivan Mehta, a physician and associate chief innovation officer at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. Telemedicine can be as simple as a doctor communicating with a patient over the phone, he said. Some patients embrace telemedicine because they want their test results quickly, whether it is by phone or video chat. Others want a face-to-face conversation.","A 78-year-old man with lung disease was told by a doctor on a streaming video that he did not have long to live, a strategy that his family saw as insensitive.",c58c3324-4872-59b9-aeae-e6250433b548,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/09/us/09xp-telemedicine/09xp-telemedicine-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0de725eeef2b143c72210e946322c19bd679aaff6ca6ad7383ad2e8805291930&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A doctor on a video conference explained to Ernest Quintana that he did not have long to live.

Science,How a Human Cousin Adapted to a Changing Climate,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/09/science/skull-south-africa-climate-change.html,"On Father's Day in June 2018, Samantha Good was working on an excavation in the Drimolen cave in South Africa's Cradle of Humankind. She uncovered what appeared to be a canine tooth jutting out from the loose brown sediment. Ms. Good kept digging until she found two more teeth and a partial palate, and then alerted her instructors. ""I think I said 'There's something interesting happening,'"" remembered Ms. Good, an undergraduate student studying anthropology at Vancouver Island University in British Columbia who was participating in a field school at the site. ""And it was in fact something very interesting."" Angeline Leece, a paleoanthropologist at La Trobe University in Melbourne, Australia, came to see what Ms. Good had found. ""I think my breath stopped for a second,"" Dr. Leece said. ""I looked up at her, and I hadn't said anything. But she saw my face, and she goes, 'Yeah, that's what I thought.'""

Ms. Good would eventually learn that she had unearthed a two-million-year-old skull that belonged to Paranthropus robustus, our large-toothed, small-brained ancient human cousin. It is the earliest and best-preserved specimen found so far of the species, which lived alongside and may have competed for resources with our direct ancestor Homo erectus. And the skull provides the best-known evidence of an ancestor of humanity evolving to adapt to a changing climate, which a team of researchers detailed on Monday in the journal Nature Ecology & Evolution.

Around two million years ago, this area in South Africa is believed to have undergone a chaotic climate shift. The regional environment transformed from wetter and more lush conditions to drier and more arid ones. In order for a species like P. robustus to survive in such terrain, it probably would have needed to be able to chew on tough plants. But the specimen found in the cave at Drimolen didn't seem to fit with what some scientists had previously stated about the human cousin. They labeled the skull DNH 155 and determined that it belonged to a male. While other skulls had been found at Drimolen, they were primarily female, and this male was smaller than the P. robustus males found at a cave nearby called Swartkrans, which was 200,000 years younger than Drimolen. Some scientists suggested that since they had found mostly large males in Swartkrans and mostly small females in Drimolen, the size differences could be chalked up to sexual dimorphism, or the physical differences between males and females seen in species, like manes in lions. The argument was that, more or less, only males lived in Swartkrans and only females in Drimolen.

""Now, that didn't seem right to me,"" Dr. Leece said. ""What it looked like to me instead is that we have males and females in Drimolen, and males and females at Swartkrans, but the Drimolen ones were just overall smaller."" That day in the cave, she slid her finger beneath the dirt and felt a large sagittal crest on the top of the skull. There were so many bones, the excavators used a special conservator's glue to adhere the fossils and sediment together to make sure they didn't lose anything. Dr. Leece and Andy Herries, a geoarchaeologist also at La Trobe, took the specimen out from the ground in one big block of dirt and bone and delivered it to Jesse Martin, a doctoral student at the university, to painstakingly piece back together. After a few weeks of gluing bones and sucking up dirt through a straw, Mr. Martin revealed the spotted skull that was ensnared in the sediment. DNH 155 was so well-preserved that one of his team members, David Strait, a paleoanthropologist at Washington University in St. Louis, remarked that it had intact nasolacrimal ducts, which is where tears drain. He said to Mr. Martin, ""This Paranthropus could have cried.""

In addition to being smaller than male P. robustus who lived at Swartkrans, DNH 155's cranium indicated its chewing muscles were not as strong as theirs. Mr. Martin said the differences suggest DNH 155 and the other P. robustus found at Drimolen were smaller not because they were all female, but rather because they were earlier forms of the species belonging to a different population that hadn't yet been subjected to the environmental pressures that would favor larger sizes and stronger jaw muscles. ""It basically hasn't become this massive chewing and grinding machine that it becomes later,"" Mr. Martin said.

The change would have been the result of microevolution, or an evolutionary change occurring within a species. Such a morphological change, the scientists said, was likely the result of P. robustus adapting to that changing climate, with members of the species who were able to get enough nutrition from a change in their food supply surviving, and passing their traits to offspring. Amelie Beaudet, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Cambridge in England who was not involved in the study, said the conclusions of this study will encourage scientists to reconsider some previous hypotheses about how and why P. robustus specimens that belong to the same species may look so different. It's also important that the study's authors didn't announce that the find was a new fossil hominin species, said Marcia Ponce de Leon, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Zurich in Switzerland. Instead, they asked ""the interesting question of how a known species changed during its evolution."" Because Ms. Good found DNH 155, she was given dedication rights. Fittingly, as it was the ""Father's Day Fossil,"" she dedicated it to her dad, Ian.",A skull found in a South African cave suggests that the species went through a process of microevolution during a chaotic environmental shift.,5b4fab23-4e17-5928-99f4-5e2535d44311,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/science/09SCI-SKULL1/09TB-SKULL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2886808ce4077dff57a2bc271b3877870cfa11501ce80105c6b4f9d99f38eec6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The two-million-year-old skull of Paranthropus robustus, a large-toothed, small-brained ancient human cousin.

Food,A Roast Chicken With Fall Flavors,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/dining/roast-chicken-recipe-maple-rosemary.html,"There are any number of ways to roast a chicken, and most home cooks have their preferred method. But while ingredients and preparations can vary, one thing is constant: Roasting a chicken can turn a weeknight dinner into a meal worthy of a celebration. A s the weather turns brisk, the days shorten and we spend more time inside, we turn to the types of dishes that offer comfort, and if they also warm up the kitchen, even better.

This simple, six-ingredient recipe does just that. Here, melted butter is combined with maple syrup and fresh rosemary -- two classic autumn flavors -- and then spooned over the top of the chicken. The bird goes into the oven for about an hour until glossy and golden. ( If you can find dark amber maple syrup for this recipe, do. Deeper in flavor and thicker than the lighter variety, it'll create a richer sauce. If it's not within reach, not to worry, just make sure to use one that is of good quality. )

The maple butter serves a dual purpose: Using it to baste the chicken ensures that the meat falls off the bone, while its natural sugars caramelize and turn the skin a nutty brown. The result is a lacquery, sweet and salty chicken that makes the house smell pretty great.

You'll have plenty of buttery pan juices left over, which you should whisk together and mop up with crusty bread or spoon over rice or roasted potatoes. Serve with a salad of chicories dressed with a bright, lemony dressing or a side of greens that have been sauteed in garlicky oil. Eat your meal around a fire, with plates on laps and a butter-streaked wineglass in hand -- you'll be happy you did.","Maple butter and rosemary are the stars of this simple, six-ingredient meal, perfect for chilly days.",15ac0b12-8cd6-59cc-b3b0-574b1acbcbea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/24/dining/24Chicken1/24Chicken1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=844b8f47b3da61490bcd3710eb3ab2b7d1650e23ae2f4adbc100054c12cf2a21&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The natural sugars in maple syrup caramelize in this recipe, turning the chicken's skin a nutty brown.",15ac0b12-8cd6-59cc-b3b0-574b1acbcbea,N24News/imgs/15ac0b12-8cd6-59cc-b3b0-574b1acbcbea.jpg,17
Technology,Hurricanes. Shootings. Fires. Time for an Editor's Emergency Kit.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/technology/personaltech/breaking-emergency-news-tech.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Julie Bloom, a deputy editor for national coverage for The Times, discussed the tech she's using. As a deputy editor on the national desk, you oversee a lot of breaking news. What tech tools do you use to help? Hurricanes. Shootings. Wildfires. Elections and earthquakes. I didn't think anything could be as crazy as the fall of 2017 in this country, but 2018 came pretty close. I primarily oversee California and parts of the West, but also handle a lot of our coverage of major breaking news. With my colleagues on the desk and our boss, Marc Lacey, the national editor, we've developed a tool kit of sorts to handle these stories that are fast-moving and intense.

I feel like each day is a little like being caught in a batter's box without knowing when or where the balls are coming from, and that can be both exhilarating and exhausting. Technology certainly helps. My phone is pretty much everything. It's kind of its own command center, and I can do almost everything on it except edit. For stories, I still need my laptop. Most of the reporters know that if they get a call from me at an odd hour, it usually means they're on their way to something awful, but the reason we can do what we do is that they are total pros. Nobody ever just hangs up and goes back to sleep. In these cases, our job is to help them produce the best journalism possible in difficult situations and make sure they stay safe, too. I'm in awe of the reporters on National who are relentless and often put themselves in danger while covering tough stories with compassion. Unfortunately, we've done enough of them now that we kind of know what to do. Recently, we had a ton of breaking news out of California, where the majority of my reporters are based. The combination of the shooting in Thousand Oaks and the wildfires was a good example of having to be really nimble. One of our California reporters, Jenny Medina, called me in what was the middle of her night to say she and a bunch of F.B.I. agents who were in Thousand Oaks after the shooting had been forced to evacuate their hotel because of the fires. You can never predict what's next, so you just have to be ready to switch gears and work with what you have. In breaking news, I rely on Twitter and Dataminr , which monitors Twitter for newsworthy patterns, to keep track of developments. We're also paying attention to police scanners, local television and all forms of social media and trying to break and confirm our own scoops, too. The trick is being careful and fast at the same time. A lot of bad information gets out in the immediate aftermath, and you never want to get it wrong.

In the middle of any given story, reporters and I communicate using text messages, Slack, Signal, Gchat and phone calls. We often spin off a Slack channel just for one event and have an email set up for breaking news that teams of reporters feed to. Those are split up into a bunch of different Google docs that we keep building out simultaneously for, say, a profile or a piece just on weapons or victims. Stories are updated dozens of times. We're also watching search trends and adjusting headlines to make sure we're showing up first. On a big, big story we'll also send out multiple alerts with new developments.

Many of your reporters are based on the West Coast, while you are stationed in New York. How do you keep in touch with them and work with them on stories? Even though it's a different time zone, we're still covering the news no matter when and where it happens. My reporters are all early risers, or they're becoming ones. We have regular calls where we brainstorm ideas, but most editing is a constant back and forth over email, Gchat and text, and that seems to work well. We're fortunate because The Times has bureaus all over the place, so sometimes we hand off to Hong Kong or London and the editors there can help keep stories going. Your contributors sometimes report stories from odd situations, like natural disasters. What tools do they use, and how do they get stories to you expediently? For stories like wildfires or hurricanes, reporters often take satellite phones with them to make sure they can keep in contact when cell communication is down. But it doesn't always work. During the recent wildfires, one reporter, Julie Turkewitz, was one of the first to enter the fire zone in Paradise, Calif., with a team of forensic experts searching for remains, and we lost contact with her for a few hours right on deadline. Thankfully, she surfaced just in time.

Sometimes good old dictation is the best means of getting scenes and reporting in real time. Reporters are also well versed in filing from their cars, Waffle Houses or the side of the road. We've had a few instances in hurricanes when reporters have had to abandon their rental cars because they were flooding and get to safety and they still managed to file. You are a Los Angeles native. In your view, how has tech changed California? I grew up in the Los Angeles area and went to school at Berkeley and keep close ties to both parts of the state, and I go back a lot to see family. California is an endlessly exciting place for The Times to cover: It's the world's fifth-largest economy, at the forefront of all sorts of change, extremely complex and a hotbed of contradictions. I like to think of it more as its own country. Technology is obviously a big part of all of that, and we're a long way from when I was a teenager on AOL Messenger. When you're not at work, what tech product do you use a lot? I'm pretty low-tech in my nonwork life -- or I try to be. When you're responsible for news, it's hard to let go. I've tried everything from burying my phone under my kitchen sink to deleting certain apps on the weekend, but at a certain point you just relent and accept. I think social media is a mostly necessary evil and try to avoid it when I'm not working, but I still haven't quit Instagram. Besides friends and family, I follow a lot of dancers and ballet companies -- remnants from a former life -- and museums, chefs and fashion designers. It's good to be reminded that there are people out there creating beautiful things, too.","When news of natural disasters or man-made ones break in the U.S., Julie Bloom taps a variety of tools to communicate with reporters, edit stories and get them published.",a107a212-ed61-5b51-b9eb-1c2f95b6db4d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/business/03techusing2/03techusing2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=90967f308c574737bebcb23a35f18287979d2a1fcb14a1d15f04c099f91ec347&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julie Bloom, a deputy editor on the national desk, communicates with her reporters in multiple ways: via text message, Slack, the Signal app, Gchat and phone calls.",a107a212-ed61-5b51-b9eb-1c2f95b6db4d,N24News/imgs/a107a212-ed61-5b51-b9eb-1c2f95b6db4d.jpg,20
Dance,"Merce Cunningham Revivals, on His Home Ground",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/arts/dance/merce-cunningham-revivals-on-his-home-ground.html,"In July 1999, three months after his 80th birthday, the choreographer Merce Cunningham received this city's highest honor for a contribution to its intellectual and cultural life, the Handel Medallion. At the presentation, in front of the curtains of what was then the New York State Theater (now the David H. Koch), Mr. Cunningham said how, 60 years before, he had first stepped onto a New York sidewalk and ""knew this was home."" From 2012 to 2014, however, this city's stages saw far too few of his dances. He died in 2009, a few months after choreographing his last magnum opus (which had its premiere at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on his 90th birthday); by his decree, his company closed in 2011. Since then, there have been many Cunningham stagings, but mostly elsewhere. The situation will improve somewhat with four important Cunningham revivals in New York, from February to April. For decades, Mr. Cunningham helped make this the world's epicenter of choreographic radicalism and a home for superb dance training. Many of his pieces took the art form into zones that nobody since has even approached. They should be forgotten only when some yet more daring dance-maker goes farther. (If only! Or, as the British say, ""the chance would be a fine thing."")

Nothing about these 2015 revivals can be predicted. Will the master's choreography succeed with dancers he did not train? What will these once startling dances look like today? Will audiences no longer regularly used to Cunningham's constant challenges adjust to the demands placed by his work? Following his work, for those who did so, was the most extraordinary and mind-expanding adventure in dance theater. It was seldom comfortable; its complexities could take many years to absorb. But it cleansed the palate more thrillingly than any other dance genre.

The first to arrive was the greatest rarity: ""Cross Currents"" (1964), a trio Mr. Cunningham created for himself and his two most celebrated female dancers, Carolyn Brown and Viola Farber. This opened for a four-day run on Wednesday, staged by New York Theater Ballet at New York Live Arts. For many, Mr. Cunningham was the most extraordinary dancer they ever saw; Ms. Brown and Ms. Farber were the two women with whom he most developed the female range of his dance style and with whom he made many of his phenomenal duets. For Theater Ballet, this is a sequel to the recent production of Mr. Cunningham's ""Septet"" (1953), in which he, Ms. Brown and Ms. Farber had created three of the six original roles. In the last years of Mr. Cunningham's career (1992-2009), his assistant was the dancer Robert Swinston, who later led the posthumous Cunningham troupe on its memorable world tour, which culminated in farewell performances in New York in December 2011. Now living in France, Mr. Swinston brings to the Joyce Theater a Cunningham Event with the Compagnie CNDC/Angers that he directs, March 10-15. A Cunningham Event is a special anthology of dance items from the Cunningham repertory; the program, usually not revealed beforehand, is likely to include solos, duets and larger ensembles culled from a wide chronological span. A Cunningham Event was (and still can be) pure dance at its purest. It can focus your eye as never before on the facts of movement and yet also confront you with dance's potential for drama, imagination, atmosphere, poetry and ambiguity.

The biggest hit of Cunningham's last 20 years was ""Biped"" (1999), the most dazzling creation of his final ""computer"" period, in which he initially devised dances on a dance-friendly computer. Many factors -- music (Gavin Bryars), designs featuring computer-generated dance-based imagery (Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar), lighting (Aaron Copp), and costumes (Suzanne Gallo) -- all came together to make this a vision of 21st-century dance before the 21st century had even begun. Its imagery seemed to many to suggest death and transcendence; whereas many Cunningham dances feature stillness, this is a perpetuum mobile in which dancers descend to the stage (each differently) only in the closing phrases, then rise again. During the week of March 25, ""Biped"" will be performed by Juilliard Dance, the students of the Juilliard School: It's probably the most audacious dance staging ever undertaken by this admirable institution. Finally, April 7-12 brings to the Joyce Theater a revival of Mr. Cunningham's unforgettable ""RainForest"" (1968). Famously, the decor is of silver Mylar pillows, designed by Andy Warhol, which travel as the performers touch them; the costumes are by Jasper Johns. Warhol had wanted the dancers naked; instead, Mr. Johns chose all-over tights that suggested lightly tanned flesh and into which he ripped slits with a razor blade. This staging will be undertaken by the Stephen Petronio Company, several of whose dancers are steeped in Cunningham technique and style. ""RainForest"" is a drama that touches on wildlife and anthropology; each of its six dancers has a vividly individual character, and the connections between them are charged with various elements of the feral.","New York Theater Ballet, Juilliard Dance, Stephen Petronio and Compagnie CNDC/Angers are bringing some of Mr. Cunningham's most notable works back to New York audiences.",1105d869-34eb-5f98-b771-b9a6041f35a4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/22/arts/22MACAULAY1/22MACAULAY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=25e1cf44942774e73d763e2d01d7e5f5a30b572b3700240cb9581341b485ba55&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Merce Cunningham's ""RainForest,"" in 2011.",1105d869-34eb-5f98-b771-b9a6041f35a4,N24News/imgs/1105d869-34eb-5f98-b771-b9a6041f35a4.jpg,6
Science,How to Cool a Planet With Extraterrestrial Dust,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/science/asteroid-ice-age-dust.html,"Extraterrestrial events -- the collision of faraway black holes, a comet slamming into Jupiter -- evoke wonder on Earth but rarely a sense of local urgency. By and large, what happens in outer space stays in outer space.

A study published Wednesday in Science Advances offered a compelling exception to that rule. A team of researchers led by Birger Schmitz, a nuclear physicist at Lund University in Sweden, found that a distant, ancient asteroid collision generated enough dust to cause an ice age long ago on Earth. The study lends new insight to ongoing efforts to address climate change.

""We've shown that what happens in the solar system can have a big influence on Earth,"" said Philipp Heck, a curator of meteorites at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and an author of the study.

Earth is frequently exposed to extraterrestrial matter; 40,000 tons of the stuff settle on the planet every year, enough to fill 1,000 tractor-trailers.

Dance,"Review: The Body, Vibrating, Is 'What Remains'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/26/arts/dance/what-remains-review-will-rawls-claudia-rankine.html,"The remains left behind in the preternatural ghostly ""What Remains"" at Danspace Project -- a collaboration between the choreographer and director Will Rawls and the poet Claudia Rankine -- have to do with the body and all of its vibrations. Here, four performers invoke states of willful persistence, spreading their bodies and voices across the stage until, as if drained from exertion, they exit one by one. The journey to get there? It's dark and elusive, sometimes frustratingly so. It feels long.

The work, a co-presentation of Danspace Project and the French Institute Alliance Francaise's Crossing the Line Festival, began as a project at Live Arts Bard. The idea was to examine the effect of surveillance on a human being.

The artists narrowed the topic to focus on the black experience and spoke intriguingly about self-surveillance in a New York Times article: The vigilance of watching your own tracks, especially in white society, in order to stay safe. Ms. Rankine's book-length poem ""Citizen"" is an inspiration.

In its most engrossing moments, ""What Remains,"" with its eerie landscape of shadows and bodies, merges words and movement with a visceral, pungent force. The well-cast quartet of Jeremy Toussaint-Baptiste, Leslie Cuyjet, Jessica Pretty and Tara Aisha Willis cross the stage in jerky or smooth dips that curl their spines into swaying reeds. Their voices are just as important; sounds and words stretch into lingering, resonant melodies.","At its best, this collaboration between the choreographer Will Rawls and the poet Claudia Rankine, merges words and movement with pungent force.",ba3a8e65-13ae-5b6a-86d4-5f2f68efa1dc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/28/arts/28whatremains-1/28whatremains-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=303358dfdeed1ad7182b473a25806f6ae584ea5a059ff9ad07648cfdd4817a4f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Jessica Pretty, Tara Aisha Willis and Leslie Cuyjet in &ldquo;What Remains.&rdquo;",ba3a8e65-13ae-5b6a-86d4-5f2f68efa1dc,N24News/imgs/ba3a8e65-13ae-5b6a-86d4-5f2f68efa1dc.jpg,6
Music,"Neil Peart, Drummer and Lyricist for Rush, Dies at 67",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/arts/music/neil-peart-dead.html,"Neil Peart, the pyrotechnical drummer and high-concept lyricist for the Canadian progressive-rock trio Rush, died on Tuesday in Santa Monica, Calif. He was 67. The cause was brain cancer, according to a statement by the band's spokesman, Elliot Mintz. Rush was formed in 1968 but found its long-term identity -- as the trio of Geddy Lee on vocals, keyboards and bass, Alex Lifeson on guitars and Mr. Peart on drums -- after Mr. Peart replaced the band's founding drummer, John Rutsey, in 1974. Mr. Peart's lyrics transformed the band's songs into multi-section suites exploring science fiction, magic and philosophy, often with the individualist and libertarian sentiments that informed songs like ""Tom Sawyer"" and ""Freewill."" And Mr. Peart's drumming was at once intricate and explosive, pinpointing odd meters and expanding the band's power-trio dynamics; countless drummers admired his technical prowess.

In a recording career that continued into the 2010s, Rush headlined arenas and had more than a dozen platinum albums. Mr. Peart was also an author, writing books about his travels and his memoirs. After a Rush tour in 2015, he retired from performing, citing its physical toll. According to the band's statement, he had been suffering from brain cancer for three and a half years.

""His drumming was songwriting,"" Foo Fighters' drummer, Taylor Hawkins, said during Rush's induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2013. ""It was just as musical, just as melodic, as any other instrument in the band."" He also noted that Mr. Peart had ""spawned a generation of air drummers for decades to come."" Neil Peart was born on Sept. 12, 1952, in Hamilton, Ontario, where his parents, Glen and Betty Peart, had a dairy farm. In 1980 he told Modern Drummer magazine that as a child he would ""pick up chopsticks and play on my sister's playpen.""

He hadn't been interested in early piano lessons, but at 13 he began taking drum lessons and found that drumming was ""pure pleasure,"" he told the magazine. ""I'd come home every day from school and play along with the radio."" After playing in rock bands during his teens, he moved to England at 18. But in 1972 he returned to Canada, where he worked at his father's farm-equipment dealership and played with local bands. In 1974, an audition got him into Rush. He became the band's lyricist, he said in 1980, ""just because the other two guys didn't want to write lyrics."" He added that he considered the band's lyrics ""secondary"" to the music. ""A lot of times you just think of a lyrical idea as a good musical vehicle,"" he said. Mr. Peart grew up as a fan of loud, flashy drummers like Keith Moon, Gene Krupa, John Bonham and Ginger Baker, and he was known for hitting his drum kit hard. But as his playing developed, he quickly earned a reputation for precisely conceived, meticulously executed drum parts. He expanded the standard drum kit with double bass drums and a wide array of cymbals, wood blocks, bells and timpani, and he eventually added electronic percussion to his arsenal when it suited the music.

Rush built an audience through extensive touring and increasing FM radio airplay, and its early 1980s albums, ""Permanent Waves"" (1980) and ""Moving Pictures"" (1981), both reached the Top Five in the United States. ""Moving Pictures,"" which includes the song ""Tom Sawyer,"" was the band's best-selling album, with four million sales in the United States. By then, Rush had established itself on the arena circuit, where it persisted until its last tour in 2015. Rush's music altered through the decades -- embracing synthesizers and electronics, reclaiming power-trio muscle -- but never shied away from musical challenges or grand verbal conceits. The band stated that ""Clockwork Angels,"" its 2012 album, ""features lost cities, pirates, anarchists, exotic carnival, and a rigid Watchmaker who imposes precision on every aspect of daily life."" It was turned into a science-fiction novel by Kevin J. Anderson. Rolling Stone placed Mr. Peart at No. 4 in its 2016 list of ""100 Greatest Drummers of All Time."" Mr. Peart paid tribute to one of his influences when he produced a two-volume compilation, ""Burning for Buddy,"" pairing the Buddy Rich Big Band with jazz and rock drummers including Mr. Peart, Max Roach, Bill Bruford, Steve Gadd and Omar Hakim. Mr. Peart also made instructional DVDs: ""A Work in Progress,"" about composing drum parts, and ""Anatomy of a Drum Solo."" He was an avid motorcyclist, and wrote six books about his travels and music.","His drumming was at once intricate and explosive, expanding Rush's power-trio dynamics.

Food,Benoît Violier's Death Shines Light on High-Pressure Restaurant World,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/02/world/europe/benoit-violier-chef-dies.html,"Benoit Violier in 2013. The French-Swiss chef was found dead on Sunday at his home in Crissier, near Lausanne, Switzerland.

In the rarefied galaxy of restaurants that have received the Michelin guide's highest honor, three stars, Benoit Violier's, in Switzerland, was by one measure the most glittering. Only two months ago his establishment, the Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville in Crissier, near Lausanne, was designated the best restaurant in the world in La Liste, rankings commissioned by the French Foreign Ministry -- an honor that only added luster to the glory of French chefs (he was born in France) in the face of competition from plucky foreign rivals. But on Monday, his friends and associates in the restaurant industry were groping to understand why Mr. Violier, at 44, had apparently shot himself to death over the weekend at his home in Crissier. And they asked whether he was the latest victim of a high-pressure world that demands perfection, shuns signs of weakness and promotes a culture where culinary demigods can be demoted with the stroke of a pen. Mr. Violier, a perfectionist known for his acumen in cooking game, ran the Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville with his wife, Brigitte. It has been awarded three Michelin stars and in December took the No. 1 spot in La Liste, France's ranking of 1,000 restaurants in 48 countries.

The death was also provoking debate in the industry as to whether sufficient support structures were available for chefs grappling with the pressures of a physically and mentally demanding job that can be in thrall to capricious rankings and unforgiving food critics. In the United States, the close-knit restaurant world was shaken in April when Homaro Cantu, 38, the innovative chef behind Moto, a Michelin-starred avant-garde restaurant in Chicago's meatpacking district, hanged himself. He also owned a cafe, Berrista. Fellow chefs asked whether he had taken on too much and succumbed, as a celebrity chef, to the seemingly impossible demands for culinary prowess, media swagger and empire-building. In 2003, Bernard Loiseau, the chef and owner of the Cote d'Or, a Michelin three-star restaurant in the Burgundy region of France, committed suicide in his home at the age of 52. The French news media said he had been distraught over a slight demotion in the Gault & Millau guide, one of the world's most influential arbiters of culinary excellence, and was worried that he could lose a star in the next edition of the Michelin guide, widely considered the most powerful of them. ""It can't keep happening; it just can't,"" the food writer Kat Kinsman said on Monday. In January she started Chefs With Issues, a project aimed at illuminating the job-related stresses and mental illnesses afflicting many people in the food industry. Depression, anxiety, addiction and eating disorders are common.

Mental illness cuts across every profession, and medical experts warned that many individuals who commit suicide suffer from a severe mood disorder that can be triggered and exacerbated by many factors related to career, family, finances and health. But Ms. Kinsman and others in the industry said that restaurant work posed unique pressures that could contribute to self-destructive behavior, including suicide. Gabriel Waterhouse, who until recently was a chef in London at Galvin La Chapelle, which has one Michelin star, said star chefs like Mr. Violier operated in an extremely competitive atmosphere, in which speaking about fears was taboo. ""People are quite macho in the industry,"" he said, ""and people don't feel they can really talk about their problems or the stresses of what is being asked of them."" He added, ""It is considered a sign of weakness if you complain, and that is intensified the higher and higher you go."" Mr. Violier was born on Aug. 22, 1971, in La Rochelle, a coastal city in western France, to a family of winemakers. In 2013, he was named chef of the year by the Gault & Millau guide. ""It would seem that he has ended his life with a firearm,"" a statement by the police said, adding that an investigation had been opened. Towering figures of French cuisine, like the chefs Paul Bocuse and Marc Veyrat, paid homage to Mr. Violier, some expressing shock and remarking on his self-effacing demeanor and culinary artistry, which had garnered him many followers. The Michelin guide released its list of starred restaurants in France for 2016 on Monday, and although Mr. Violier's establishment is in Switzerland, he had been planning to attend a ceremony in Paris for the new rankings, according to the Swiss news media. Instead, the proceedings began with a minute of silence for him.

Patricia Zizza, who has worked by Mr. Bocuse's side for 40 years and has known some of the world's greatest chefs, including Mr. Violier, said the expectation of creating a masterwork every day could push some chefs to depression and exhaustion. ""Chefs are in the theater and must produce great work, and there is strong pressure to maintain that excellence,"" Ms. Zizza said. ""It requires an enormous amount of attention, from assuring the quality of the products to directing teams of people. And it entails many sacrifices, including to one's personal life."" She said Mr. Violier had been shaken by the death last year of his mentor, the Swiss chef Philippe Rochat, who died after falling ill while cycling. Mr. Violier and his wife began running the Restaurant de l'Hotel de Ville in 2012, after Mr. Rochat retired. Mr. Violier's survivors include his wife and their son, Romain, according to Swiss news outlets. La Liste was commissioned by the French Foreign Ministry, apparently as a response to the London-based World's 50 Best Restaurants. The British rankings were criticized by some in France as failing to give French restaurants their rightful due, but others in the culinary establishment regarded the French effort as misguided. When Mr. Violier was awarded the top place in La Liste's ranking in December, he responded with characteristic modesty. ""I feel a heavy responsibility to be named number one,"" he said in an interview with The New York Times, published in December. He added that the key to his success was consistency, not flashiness, and he singled out his loyal team, including Louis Villeneuve, his maitre d'hotel, who has been in his post for four decades. ""This ranking is a recognition of seriousness, of delivering the same fidelity and level of excellence from the beginning of January to the end of December,"" Mr. Violier said. ""It's a great tribute to the team.""","Mr. Violier ran the Restaurant de l'Hôtel de Ville in Switzerland, which was named the world's best in December.

Technology,Groups in Myanmar Fire Back at Zuckerberg,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/technology/zuckerberg-facebook-myanmar.html,"SHANGHAI -- Civil society groups in Myanmar on Thursday criticized Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, arguing that he mischaracterized his company's effectiveness at detecting and quashing messages encouraging violence in the country. Taking aim at comments Mr. Zuckerberg made in a recent interview, the groups said that Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar. The same problems keep recurring, they said, with the company routinely failing to follow up on their comments and suggestions. In a conversation with Ezra Klein of Vox this week, Mr. Zuckerberg referred to a pair of chain letters that were widely shared in Myanmar on Facebook Messenger last year. One message warned Buddhist groups about an imminent attack by Muslims, expected on Sept. 11. The other, spread among Muslims, cautioned of violence from Buddhist nationalists on the same date. ""So that's the kind of thing where I think it is clear that people were trying to use our tools in order to incite real harm,"" Mr. Zuckerberg said. ""Now, in that case, our systems detect that that's going on. We stop those messages from going through.""

In an open letter, the organizations, which have worked with Facebook to flag dangerous and misleading content, including the chain letters, said the messages had spread for days, caused widespread fear and set off at least three violent incidents. They also said there was no system at all, only a group of organizations and volunteers doing their best to keep up with a torrent of vitriol.

""In your interview, you refer to your detection 'systems.' We believe your system, in this case, was us -- and we were far from systematic,"" the letter says. ""From where we stand, this case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation: It reveals an overreliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around systemic solutions and a lack of transparency."" Facebook responded to the criticism in a satement on Friday. ""We are sorry that Mark did not make clearer that it was the civil society groups in Myanmar who first reported these messages,"" it said. ""We took their reports very seriously and immediately investigated ways to help prevent the spread of this content. We should have been faster, and are working hard to improve our technology and tools to detect and prevent abusive, hateful or false content.""

Myanmar highlights existential questions about Facebook's mission and responsibilities. The site has closely connected people in the country -- in many cases, Facebook is the only online service they use. It has also become a major channel for the spread of hate speech and propaganda that has encouraged and obfuscated ethnic cleansing of the country's Muslim Rohingya, according to human rights groups. Almost 700,000 Rohingya have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since last summer, when the military started a crackdown in the country's western Rakhine State. Last month, United Nations investigators said Facebook played a role in spreading hate speech that incited violence against the Rohingya. For Mr. Zuckerberg, the timing of the letter is bad. Both he and his top deputy, Sheryl Sandberg, are making multiple media appearances this week to address questions about how the company handles users' personal data. The company has faced harsh criticism for reports on how information about millions of users may have been improperly leaked to a political consulting firm connected to President Trump's 2016 campaign. The criticism has sent the company's stock tumbling. Next week, Mr. Zuckerberg is expected to appear at multiple congressional hearings. Among the half-dozen signatories of the letter posted on Thursday in Myanmar are Phandeeyar, a leading technology hub in the country that helped Facebook draft its Burmese-language community standards; Myanmar ICT for Development Organization, which monitors online hate speech; and the Center for Social Integrity.

""Presumably, your data team should be able to trace the original sources of flagged messages and posts and identify repeat offenders, using these insights to inform your moderation and sanctioning,"" the letter says. Myanmar is on the verge of civil war. Following a military coup on Feb. 1, unrest has been growing. Peaceful pro-democracy demonstrations have given way to insurgent uprisings against the Tatmadaw, the country's military, which ousted the country's civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi is a polarizing figure. The daughter of a hero of Myanmar's independence, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi remains very popular at home. Internationally, her reputation has been tarnished by her recent cooperation with the same military generals who ousted her. The coup ended a short span of quasi-democracy. In 2011, the Tatmadaw implemented parliamentary elections and other reforms. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi came to power as state councillor in 2016, becoming the country's de facto head of government. The coup was preceded by a contested election. In the Nov. 8 election, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi's party won 83 percent of the body's available seats. The military, whose proxy party suffered a crushing defeat, refused to accept the results of the vote. Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi could face time in prison. She was detained by the junta and secretly put on trial. If convicted of all 11 charges against her, which include ""inciting public unrest,"" she could be sentenced to a maximum of 102 years in prison. Jes Petersen, chief executive of Phandeeyar, said problematic messages in Myanmar were not a one-time problem. ""There's multiple cases of similar things that have happened where we've done everything we can to bring it to Facebook's attention but we don't see much happening on their end,"" he said. ""That's a big part of the problem."" Victoire Rio, a social media analyst in the country who previously worked at Phandeeyar, said another major issue was Facebook's lack of Burmese speakers for local monitors to communicate directly with. ""It's evident to us that there are not enough resources and not enough human resources dedicated to Myanmar,"" Ms. Rio said. She added that the company's Burmese-speaking reviewers were based in Dublin, and from the company's recruiting pages it seems it is struggling to find qualified candidates. The groups also faulted Facebook's lack of transparency. They said that after they had reported the messages that Mr. Zuckerberg cited in his interview, they heard nothing from the company about what happened or how Facebook would better respond. ""I was seriously concerned and looking for anyone I could,"" Ms. Rio said. ""I was surprised to hear that Mark had been contacted about this fairly quickly, the use of strong language was effective.""","Responding to Mark Zuckerberg's comments in a Vox interview, civil society advocates said Facebook had no consistent methods for dealing with hate speech in Myanmar.",7a8a4912-ac2b-5c69-857c-bcddc20f34e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/06/business/06fbmyanmar/06fbmyanmar-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=972ac2e224c92eb4b57c6bc9e05d1e1bf604f2fee420915673470208184e6bb7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A half-dozen civil society groups in Myanmar said in an open letter on Thursday that Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, had mischaracterized the social network's efforts to detect hate speech in their country.",7a8a4912-ac2b-5c69-857c-bcddc20f34e3,N24News/imgs/7a8a4912-ac2b-5c69-857c-bcddc20f34e3.jpg,20
Sports,FIFA's Boss Wants to Remake the Game. Europe Wants No Part of It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/sports/fifa-uefa-infantino.html,"FIFA President Gianni Infantino's plans to reorder world soccer are being stymied by a familiar foe: Europe. Since proposing several major changes to the sport's calendar last spring, Infantino has spent months traveling the world hosting minisummits with the leaders of FIFA's 211 member federations. His goal is to win support for a proposal to introduce two new tournaments -- an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams -- that would be underwritten by a $25 billion offer from a group led by the Japanese conglomerate SoftBank. The listening exercise follows repeated failures by Infantino to force the proposals through FIFA's governing council, but if they are approved they would represent the biggest changes to soccer in a generation, and their adoption -- and the multibillion-dollar cash infusion to FIFA -- would provide Infantino with a signature success ahead of his bid to secure a second term as FIFA president later this year. Each of the meetings on Infantino's tour, including the most recent one held in Marrakesh, Morocco, has included about 50 federation leaders from across soccer's six regional confederations. At the end of each session, the federation representatives are handed electronic tablets and asked to select their preferred options for the new tournaments.

Infantino's problem is that European officials attending the meetings have stubbornly refused to offer any opinions. Instead, they have told Infantino and his team that the feelings of Aleksander Ceferin, the president of the European governing body, UEFA, and his governing council represent their views. Some of the Europeans balked because the list of options for the Club World Cup did not include the option of not holding the tournament, which is often an annoyance for the European champion who attends, at all. On FIFA's tablets, voters are asked to pick from only three choices: a tournament with 16, 24 or 32 teams. Ceferin, under pressure from clubs and federations in Europe, has clashed repeatedly with Infantino over the proposed changes both to the Club World Cup and to the broader global soccer calendar, with Ceferin most frustrated by new initiatives that could challenge the hegemony of existing club tournaments like UEFA's Champions League and add to the workload of players. ""I cannot accept that some people who are blinded by the pursuit of profit are considering to sell the soul of football tournaments to nebulous private funds,"" Ceferin said in a speech last May. ""Money does not rule -- and the European sports model must be respected. Football is not for sale. I will not let anyone sacrifice its structures on the altar of a highly cynical and ruthless mercantilism."" Infantino first presented details of a plan for an expanded Club World Cup at a FIFA Council meeting in Bogota, Colombia, last March. Citing a nondisclosure agreement, he refused to identify the financial backers of the proposal, which are believed to include not only SoftBank but also financing from the Middle East, which Infantino eventually denied were directly linked to sovereign wealth funds. (Saudi Arabia remains the biggest individual backer over Softbank's Vision Fund, the biggest private-equity fund ever raised.) Instead, Infantino pressed the council to let him close the deal on his own.

European leaders at the meeting balked, and Ceferin and Infantino have not held a meeting since the Colombia summit. In October, European officials threatened to walk out of the last meeting when Infantino suggested he planned to call another vote. The vote did not take place; instead, FIFA set up a task force involving representatives from the six confederations and asked it to produce an acceptable plan before a scheduled FIFA Council meeting in March in Miami. At the last summit, in Morocco, Infantino expressed frustration to the officials who declined to take part in the vote for his plans, according to multiple people present at the meeting. ""As part of this discussion, people are asked to give their feedback on a series of proposals and, as in any democratic consultation process, every member can express its opinion freely,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""The feedback received will be fed back to the Council together with the results of the other consultation platforms."" FIFA's task force for the two tournaments will hold its next meeting on Feb. 21 in Rio de Janeiro. As tensions grow, however, there is a chance that European executives will not attend, according to a person familiar with the continental leaders' plans. UEFA declined to comment. The organization has been seeking the support of European clubs and leagues to oppose Infantino's proposals. At the last two meetings, Ceferin has arrived armed with signed letters of opposition from The European Club Association, a union of the continent's top clubs, and a separate group representing the continent's domestic leagues. The proposals to expand the Club World Cup and to create a new global Nations League similar to the recently created UEFA version largely have the backing of officials from South America, Africa and Asia -- likely enough to win a vote should Infantino choose to take one at the Miami meeting. Any such move would exacerbate the growing rift with Europe, however, and potentially lead to a larger crisis if top clubs and leading nations from UEFA refuse to participate in the new FIFA-controlled tournaments.","Gianni Infantino, FIFA's president, has spent months pushing a plan to add two tournaments to the global soccer calendar, but European officials have been stubborn.",f9b10ef1-d60a-5763-9939-d3b56c51d8af,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/22/sports/22FIFAprint/22FIFAprint-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=0cc6ccc2b504d8f0ca0a7c6eeb50af98c34bceb38be463bdbc5ca7fe2a67c518&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gianni Infantino, the president of FIFA, wants an expanded World Cup for clubs and a new league for national teams.",f9b10ef1-d60a-5763-9939-d3b56c51d8af,N24News/imgs/f9b10ef1-d60a-5763-9939-d3b56c51d8af.jpg,9
Music,Billie Eilish Has Huge Billboard Debut as Nipsey Hussle Climbs Chart After Death,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/08/arts/music/billie-eilish-nipsey-hussle-billboard.html,"The mainstream arrival of a new 17-year-old pop star reached its final stage this week as Billie Eilish's first album put up big numbers and debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard chart.

""When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go?""

Those numbers gave Eilish the second-largest sales week of the year so far, behind only Ariana Grande, whose ""Thank U, Next"" debuted with 360,000 units in February.

Eilish's album succeeded across formats: Its streaming total was the third-highest ever for a female artist (behind Grande and Cardi B), while the LP also sold 15,000 copies on vinyl, Billboard reported, the best sales week in that format this year.

At No. 2 on the Billboard 200 chart is Nipsey Hussle, the Los Angeles rapper who was shot and killed on March 31.

Television,'The Affair' Series Finale Recap: The End of the Affair,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/03/arts/television/the-affair-finale.html,"The final episode of ""The Affair"" begins and ends with different versions of the same song. In its opening minutes, ""The Whole of the Moon"" by the Irish folk-rock band the Waterboys blares forth while Noah Solloway drills friends and family in a dance routine for his daughter Whitney's wedding. As sung by the vocalist Mike Scott, the lyrics regard a loved one with awe that borders on pagan devotion: ""I saw the crescent,"" he joyfully yelps. ""You saw the whole of the moon."" By the time the episode ends, Noah is an old man, alone with his memories on the shores of Montauk. This time, Fiona Apple, who provided the show's opening theme, performs the song. In her ragged voice, the lyrics sound less like praise and more like accusations: When she sings ""I sighed, but you swooned,"" the words catch and drag in her throat like a curse. Yet the sense that Apple is in love, deeply, with the person to whom she is singing is no less palpable here than it is in Scott's original. Rather, her performance reflects the way the people we love can confound, even infuriate us while at their best as well as at their worst. Sometimes, loving someone who feels bigger and better than we are can be an enormous burden. Sometimes we want to see only a sliver of the sky rather than the whole thing, and to hell with those who would force us out of ourselves to do otherwise. If you've watched all five seasons of ""The Affair,"" you can see where this is going. To Helen Solloway, her ex-husband, Noah, is maddeningly impulsive and self-pitying but also patient and sweet. To Noah, his ex-wife Helen is infuriatingly Type A and judgmental but also caring and almost impossibly together. Sometimes their virtues are nearly as difficult to tolerate as their vices. But that's love, isn't it?

Written and directed by the series's co-creator, Sarah Treem, the grand finale is really grand only in its feature-length running time. Compared to some of the show's baroque twists and turns getting to this point, the plot is simplicity itself. In the present(-ish) day, Whitney Solloway gets married with a great deal of help from her father, whom she has banished from the festivities because of the sexual-misconduct accusations against him. When she learns he was in town, planning everything behind the scenes, she whisks her new husband and her siblings off to his motel -- where she discovers, to her mingled horror and amusement, that her mother has, shall we say, gotten there first. Despite it all, Noah and Helen still love each other, and they've rekindled that love at last. Thirty years later, Joanie, the adult daughter of Noah's ex-wife Allison, debates whether or not to reunite with her own estranged husband, whom she left after cheating on him for years. Two chance encounters seal the deal for her. First, she is tracked down once again by her two-night-stand epigeneticist, E.J., who it turns out is the son of Helen's partner Vik and his one-night-stand Sierra. (""My mother is your mother's ex-husband's ex-wife's new partner's lover,"" is how he phrases it. Try saying that five times fast!) E.J. lets slip that the chatty old owner of the run-down Lobster Roll is none other than Noah, with whom she then has a long heart-to-heart. E.J.'s story of how Helen and Sienna became close friends despite the tempestuous origins of their relationship, and Noah's argument that ""if trauma and pain can echo through generations, so can love,"" drive her back into the arms of her husband and children. The show, too, seemed to be making a welcome retreat into safety and security after prolonged periods of tumult. Noah's reunion with Helen, at whose grave we later see him reading a book by their daughter Stacey , washes away many of his sins against her and other women -- or at least serves as an acknowledgment that his flaws were not irredeemable. Their kids giggle together, sharing champagne and wedding cake outside their motel room as their parents make love inside; it's a very weird family dynamic, but the important thing is that they're a family again, just as with Joanie and her family years later.

For crying out loud, the final shot shows Noah dancing by himself as he looks out at the sea, the Montauk lighthouse standing tall behind him. It doesn't get much more valedictory than that. In the main, I think the show earned that valediction. No drama I can think of dug as deep into contemporary gender mores, or was as unflinching in dragging its discoveries into the light. Few come even close to matching its ambition in terms of the difficult adult issues it addressed, including veteran PTSD and the grief of losing a child and sexism in the publishing world and dealing with senile dementia and ... you know, just being really horny and letting that screw up your life. And the show's central conceit, showing events from overlapping and often contradictory perspectives, forced not only the writers but also the actors to present multiple takes on each of those issues. The hero of one segment could be the heel just a few minutes of screen time later, and it fell on the shoulders of Dominic West, Maura Tierney, Ruth Wilson, Joshua Jackson, Julia Goldani Telles and a host of other fine and fearless actors to pull it off. Even if the writing stumbled now and then -- I still can't get over Joanie's encounter with her mother's supervillainous murderer -- I'm hard pressed to think of a time when the performances dropped the ball. Of course, two of the aforementioned performers were nowhere to be found in the finale, as Wilson and Jackson departed the show after its fourth season. To the extent that this hail-and-farewell ending strikes any serious bum notes, it's in papering over how important Jackson and Wilson's characters were to the show and to what it stood for. If you think back on the first season in particular, on the erotic and emotional tension of Noah and Alison's unfolding relationship, the idea that this, in the end, was Noah and Helen's love story is a hard one to swallow. But like the characters, I find myself in a forgiving mood. For five seasons, ""The Affair"" gave me food for thought on topics I would perhaps have not thought too much about, given how painfully hard they are to resolve in real life. The message of the finale is that you can't resolve them, not really -- you can resolve only to accept them and move on. You have to make an effort to see the whole of the moon, but hey, there it is.
* None My least expected, most welcome grace note: John Doman's normally insufferable Bruce Butler. First, in a shockingly moving scene, he mistakes Noah for his own kid brother Michael, who appears to have died in Vietnam. Second, after regaining lucidity later that night, he pretends to fall into his own pool so that Whitney, her husband and the kids can all escape the reception undetected. He was such an unrelenting jerk for most of the series that these moments of redemption hit me hard.
* None When Helen shows up at Noah's motel room, he's reading Philip Roth. Difficult literary men have to stick together!
* None I remain fascinated by how the costumes shift from viewpoint to viewpoint: Helen's dress is much more va-va-voom in Noah's version of events than it is in her own, while the kids' outfits are all more dandyish and decorative in hers than in his.
* None I know I kicked off this review by talking about this, but it bears repeating: Fiona Apple's version of ""The Whole of the Moon"" was an unexpected delight to hear. When she sings, she holds nothing back. For this show, it works.",The perspective-shifting series ended its five-season run with a few last surprises and a few last chances for redemption.,e94d51b1-501c-5ca1-9fe0-cbb0a3eaa497,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/03/arts/03affair-recap/03affair-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=064d672799029c4cb73d49ceecede3b2e329e8e21e8b8812fee3b17c77a8076f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dominic West in a scene from the series finale of ""The Affair.""",e94d51b1-501c-5ca1-9fe0-cbb0a3eaa497,N24News/imgs/e94d51b1-501c-5ca1-9fe0-cbb0a3eaa497.jpg,3
Automobiles,"The Car Changes, but the Name Remains the Same",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/automobiles/collectibles/the-car-changes-but-the-name-remains-the-same.html,"The Car Changes, but the Name Remains the Same

IT is entirely possible that young shoppers poking around Dodge showrooms for a view of the brand's just-arriving 2013 compact sedans will have no idea of the half-century history behind the car's nameplate. Still, the automaker felt it had sound reasons to apply the Dart name, which it had not used in three decades, to this all-important model. The new Dart drapes a sharply chiseled body over a chassis shared with the Alfa Romeo division of Fiat, Chrysler's Italian parent. ""Dart resonated well with younger and older potential compact-car buyers,"" a Chrysler spokeswoman, Kathy Graham, wrote in an e-mail. Older customers, she added, remembered the Dart ""as a reliable car at a good value, and as one of the first value-oriented performance cars."" To younger ones, the name suggested ""aerodynamics and precision."" The company's use of the Dart name traces back to a show car done by its innovative design chief, Virgil Exner, for 1956. A sleek 22-foot schooner of a machine with a clean, curvaceous figure crowned by soaring tail fins, the Chrysler Dart was fabricated by Ghia, the Italian coachbuilder. It existed for just one year; a styling makeover for the 1957 auto show season pared down the fins, and it was renamed the Diablo.

Dodge first used the Dart badge on a line of large cars for 1960-61, which included the Seneca, Pioneer and Phoenix. The name shifted to a midsize series with rather peculiar styling for 1962. The Dart most often remembered today, however, is the compact model built from 1963-76 and best known for its affordability and durability. Introduced as a smoothly styled replacement for the Lancer, the new Dart was built on the light but strong unibody chassis of its slightly smaller corporate cousin, the Plymouth Valiant. Hitting a sweet spot between the period's compact and midsize models was a Dart selling point. A variety of sedans, coupes, convertibles, station wagons -- even tire-smoking muscle cars -- gave the Dart broad enough appeal to sell some 3.7 million cars over 13 years. Scott Sigethy fits one of the age groups at which Dodge is aiming the new Dart -- he was born in 1974 -- but he prefers the two Darts he already owns. One is the 1975 sedan that his grandfather bought new after closing his butcher shop in Jersey City. The other is a 1974 model Mr. Sigethy bought more recently near his North Carolina home -- and that he later discovered had been built on the day he was born.

Getting his grandfather's Dart when he was 22 provided Mr. Sigethy with daily transportation and a hobby. ""I took auto shop classes and bought some tools from Sears so I could do my own maintenance and repairs,"" he said in a telephone interview. Dapper in its Silver Cloud paint and black vinyl roof, Mr. Sigethy's well-preserved '75 model epitomizes the ethos of ""economy with dignity"" that inspired loyalty to the Darts of that era. The car, which sold new for $4,297, seems meagerly equipped by today's standards, with an automatic transmission, power steering and split bench front seat among its few options; the car lacks air-conditioning and power brakes. Mr. Sigethy installed a larger carburetor to give the 225-cubic-inch, 6-cylinder engine a bit more pep. Inherently solid engineering made the early Dart a good candidate for wringing out more performance, despite its original mission as an economy model. In fact, the old version dueled with Alfa Romeos on racetracks -- a curious twist, given that the 2013 Dart's underpinnings came from the Italian brand. In 1966, an Alfa Romeo GTA won the inaugural race of the Trans American Sedan Championship, or Trans-Am for short, at the Sebring racetrack in Florida. A white Dart driven by Bob Tullius finished second and won the class for cars with engines over 2 liters displacement. Tullius, perhaps best remembered by racing enthusiasts for the Group 44 Racing Triumphs and Jaguars, also piloted the Dart to victory in a 12-hour race at Marlboro Motor Raceway in Maryland. ""In those days, according to the rules, the cars weren't much beyond stock,"" Tullius said from his Florida home. ""The Dart was a good, strong street car. We tweaked the engine, gutted the interior, installed a roll bar, changed springs and shocks, put on better wheels. That was about it.""

The reputation for durability stemmed in large part from an in-line 6-cylinder engine that powered about two-thirds of all Darts sold, including Mr. Sigethy's silver sedan. The cylinder block's 30-degree tilt toward the passenger side -- the source of the engine's Slant Six nickname -- let designers specify a lower hood line, and it made room for efficient fuel and exhaust systems. Andy Wittenborn of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., can vouch for the Dart's sturdiness. An auto repair shop he ran for 25 years specialized in Darts and Valiants. ""I should have gotten into more profitable work,"" he joked in a phone interview. His wife's everyday car is a 1972 Dart Custom sedan bought 20 years ago with 100,000 miles on the odometer. The car, with a 318 cubic-inch V-8 engine, now has over 300,000. ""She tells people, 'I'll drive it as long as he can fix it,' "" Mr. Wittenborn said. Dodge deftly adapted the Dart to changing times and consumer trends. Tasteful redesigns on the same capable chassis every few years, along with a steady stream of new model variations, helped keep the car fresh and contemporary. A sporty GT model, with 6-cylinder or V-8 power, offered bucket seats and special trim, while the 1967-69 GTS gave the brand another muscle car entry during the heyday of that trend. In 1968, a 275-horsepower 340-cubic-inch V-8 made the Dart GTS convertible a speedy mount for chasing -- or eluding -- bad guys in the ""Mannix"" TV series. Played by Mike Connors, the tough-guy private eye Joe Mannix regularly engaged in high-speed chases on twisty mountain roads around Los Angeles. A Chrysler product placement, the Dart received a dark green paint job and light customization by the famed custom-car builder George Barris. ""I've owned about 50 collector cars, but this is by far the coolest one,"" said the current owner of the celebrity Dart, C. Van Tune, who was formerly the editor of Motor Trend magazine. The car had been restored by the previous owner with help from a former Barris employee after it was found languishing at a California park ranger's station. Mr. Tune says he drives the Dart about once a month, including occasional 100-mile trips into Los Angeles from his home. ""A lot of people recognize it as the 'Mannix' car, probably thanks to the DVD sets out now,"" he said.

By 1970, the most popular Dart model, by a large margin, was a two-door hardtop called the Swinger. A version with the 340 V-8 was a fast muscle-car bargain. Clever engineering, appealing styling and savvy marketing gave the Dart its best sales years in the early 1970s, even against growing domestic and import competition. Grafting the Dart's front-end sheet metal onto Plymouth's Valiant-based Duster coupe gave Dodge the 1971 Demon. Dodge changed the Demon's name to Dart Sport for 1973. An optional fold-down rear seat and hand-cranked sunroof made the Dart Sport a ""convertriple"" -- Dodge marketing parlance for a three-cars-in-one coupe that offered, in theory at least, the fresh-air benefits of a convertible and the utility of a small station wagon. A special edition called the Hang 10 flaunted a surfing theme and was, one hopes, the only production car ever to come from the factory with orange shag carpeting. The ""uncommon luxury"" Dodge promoted in the 1975 Dart SE meant an automatic transmission, velour upholstery and upgraded interior trim, a vinyl roof and hubcaps matched to the body color. Two low-volume models provided curious bookends in the Dart's final year. Reduced vehicle weight and powertrain tweaks gave the Slant Six-powered 1976 Dart Lite an advertised mileage rating of 36 m.p.g. on the highway. Adjustments to the Environmental Protection Agency's test would surely lower that number in today's terms, but it was still impressive for a car of the Dart Sport's size and room. Car and Driver, testing American cars for highest speeds, took the V-8-powered Dart 360 Sport up to 121 m.p.h. Only the top Chevrolet Corvette, at about twice the cost, was faster, at 124 m.p.h. The Pontiac Firebird Trans-Am with a 455 cubic-inch V-8 was 4 m.p.h. behind the Dart. The Dart's replacement, the Aspen, also arrived for 1976, and Dart production continued in Brazil until 1981.","The Dart name traces back to a 1956 show car, but the model most often remembered is the compact built from 1963-76.

Theater,Review: A Nose by Any Other Name in a Hudson Valley 'Cyrano',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/theater/cyrano-review.html,"Jason O'Connell and Brenda Withers's adaptation of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival asks us not to take anything at face value .

GARRISON, N.Y. -- Did those people who were preening so happily before their own cameras feel an admonitory chill? T rue, t heatergoers a t the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival's Monday night performance had been encouraged to snap their own pictures. In the carnival-style tent that serves as a theater on the grounds of the Boscobel Estate , there was an unmissable sign labeled ""Selfie Booth,"" center stage, and a big paper-moon backdrop, with a box of antic props and costumes for posing. Or to be exact, the sign read ""Cyrano's Selfie Booth."" And had there been such a thing as cameras in the days of the original Cyrano, he would surely never have stood still for one. More likely, he'd have taken a sword to anyone who pointed a lens in his direction. The last name of this irascible cavalier is de Bergerac, and as you may know, he had a really big nose, which limited his romantic prospects and made the mirror his enemy. His story, as penned by Edmond Rostand in the late 19th century, is perhaps the most famous of all theatrical tales about the shortsightedness of judging people by their looks.

Now Jason O'Connell and Brenda Withers have adapted Rostand's ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" as the more familiarly titled ""Cyrano,"" in a production that moves on to the Two River Theater in Red Bank, N.J., next month. As directed by Meredith McDonough, with a cast of five led by Mr. O'Connell in the title role, this is an amiable, easygoing interpretation for an age drowning in self-glamorizing self-portraiture, asking us (to crib from Shakespeare) to look not with the eyes, but with the mind. In a way, the 33-year-old Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival has always promoted such a perspective. Using minimal sets, throwaway costumes and performers of varying professionalism, this troupe asks its audiences to look beyond the evidence of their eyes and join in a collective act of make-believe. In this instance, for example, Mr. O'Connell is wearing no nose-extending prosthesis like the ones sported by Jose Ferrer, Gerard Depardieu and Steve Martin in film adaptations. A black piece of tape has been attached above one nostril to signal his distinctive proboscis. Mr. O'Connell's resume includes a confessional one-man comedy show (""The Dork Knight,"" seen at Joe's Pub in New York). Accordingly, he brings out the stand-up artist in Cyrano, a man who brandishes one-liners as if they were rapiers. He may be a tad too sweet for his combative character. But he's eminently likable. (It should be fascinating to see what Peter Dinklage, of ""Game of Thrones,"" makes of the same role in the forthcoming New Group musical ""Cyrano"" in Manhattan.)

Mr. O'Connell's fellow cast members -- Britney Simpson (as Cyrano's love, Roxane), Luis Quintero (as Roxane's love, Christian), George Merrick and Nance Williamson -- each play multiple roles, changing genders, ages and dispositions via scarves, shawls and headgear . It seems safe to say that none of them look like central casting's idea of most of the parts they play. But throughout their quicksilver transformations, we accept them as who they say they are, because that's the bargain that theater demands of us. There's a welcome, self-conscious wit in such metamorphoses, as when Mr. Merrick, playing a foot soldier, looks in wonder after the aristocratic fop who has just left the stage, also played by Mr. Merrick.

If a certain amount of vaudevillian shtick is required to keep everyone's identities separate, that's just fine. At a full two and a half hours, the show is perhaps a shade too long for a production that often traffics in quick-sketch characterization. But a familiar story is told clearly and appealingly, in a contemporary language that includes a host of sometimes witty, sometimes strained variations on Cyrano's self-mocking wit. (In this version, the character's catalog of pre-emptive insults about his nose includes the lines, ""Did you need a special permit for that extension?"" and ""Based on the Pinocchio principle, I'm assuming you work in politics?"") The set, as usual, is spectacular. I mean the Hudson River Valley landscape on view from the open-sided tent, which provides a ready-made backdrop out of Frederic Church, changing color and perspective as twilight turns to night. ""Cyrano,"" though, provides fewer opportunities for exploiting such natural beauty than the cosmically minded Shakespeare plays that are the troupe's bread and butter. But there's a wonderful, man-made full moon for the finale that seems to have been conjured out of the river itself. Then there's the moment when the plucky Roxanne materializes out of the darkness amid a battlefield of starving soldiers as a Beyonce-like goddess, in an immense gown that transforms her into a walking cornucopia. (Jessica Wegener Shay is the costume designer.) This turns out to be only an illusion. But then, so is the Beyonce in selfies and on album covers. It's nice to be so pleasantly reminded, in a moment of arduously manipulated optics, that what you see is usually far from the whole story.","Jason O'Connell and Brenda Withers's adaptation of ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" at the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival asks us not to take anything at face value.",63a13f27-ac5f-5aae-9b97-55324e5aadc5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/22/arts/21cyrano1/merlin_159341409_cf8ee9d8-dc7a-4d96-9870-6aecf488c7e5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8844fa74561cdb23c220e22c369b91337b9ddc61cd49290e76bfbce57d6f08e1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Britney Simpson, left, as Roxane and Jason O&rsquo;Connell as the title character in &ldquo;Cyrano.&rdquo;",63a13f27-ac5f-5aae-9b97-55324e5aadc5,N24News/imgs/63a13f27-ac5f-5aae-9b97-55324e5aadc5.jpg,10
Real Estate,Coming Home to the Lower East Side,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/10/realestate/coming-home-to-the-lower-east-side.html,"In 1966, when she was 11, Ruth Santiago moved from Puerto Rico to an apartment on Pitt Street, on the Lower East Side, with her parents and five brothers. The youngest of 17 children, Ms. Santiago had many older siblings already living in New York by then, which made the move feel like an adventure and a homecoming. ""When my nieces and nephews came over, it was always like a party,"" Ms. Santiago said. ""I loved it."" She remembers playing in the snow in the empty lot behind her apartment building, attending P.S. 12 and going to church with her parents, who were members of the Primitive Christian Church on East Broadway. Her father, a minister and army veteran, spoke English fluently and wanted his children to, as well. Eight years later, at the urging of her parents, Ms. Santiago moved back to Puerto Rico. But she retained a fondness for the city and her old neighborhood. And later in life, after her husband died in 2010, she longed to return to the Lower East Side.

""After he passed on, I always had this yearning to come back,"" Ms. Santiago said. ""In Puerto Rico, I was very involved with the community and politics. I needed a fresh start. This is where I had good memories. I had good memories there, too, but it was very connected to my husband."" She met her husband, Juan Hernandez Ferrer, who grew up in Brooklyn, shortly after moving back to Puerto Rico, where she worked as a bilingual secretary to the mayor of Toa Baja, a municipality in the north. Mr. Hernandez Ferrer happened to be the mayor. He later became a senator in District 2, and they had two sons, who are now 32 and 33 and live in New York. On a rental budget of less than $1,000 a month, she could hardly afford to live in New York, let alone in a highly sought-after area like the Lower East Side. Ms. Santiago, who is retired, spent most of her life doing counseling, as well as community-, arts- and church-related work, much of it unpaid, and now lives on Social Security income.

Occupation: Before retiring, Ms. Santiago founded and ran the Nehemiah Foundation, a nonprofit focused on religion and the arts in Puerto Rico. Mr. Hernandez, her son, is a cook at Russ & Daughters.

The youngest of 17: ""I was protected by my parents and my brothers. I felt like a little princess,"" she said. ""Cuchy was my nickname growing up -- I was very ticklish since I was a little girl and I was always laughing, laughing, laughing.""

She speaks English fluently: ""But I still have my accent,"" she said. ""I don't want to lose it. I keep it intentionally.""

On food: ""My son does most of the cooking,"" Ms. Santiago said. ""I can do some Spanish dishes like arroz con pollo, but he likes to show off."" But memories weren't the only thing drawing her to the Lower East Side. She also wanted to be close to family members who lived there, including an 85-year-old sister with Alzheimer's. ""I said, 'I want to be in my old neighborhood,' and I didn't want to live in an old apartment -- I was worried, I see a lot of fires,"" Ms. Santiago said. ""My son says, 'Mom, you're asking too much. You're never going to get that.'"" ""But I believe in prayer,"" she said. ""I was like, 'God knows my heart.'""

And then her brother-in-law told her about Essex Crossing, a mixed-used development primarily on the south side of Delancey Street, that was giving affordable housing preference to those who could prove they lived in the Seward Park Urban Renewal Area between 1965 and 1973. During that period, Robert Moses had demolished tenements, displacing and dispersing the ethnically diverse communities that had long called the area home. After that, the land remained vacant for decades, until the Bloomberg era, when a coalition of companies now known as Delancey Street Associates (including L+M Development Partners, BFC Partners, Taconic Investment Partners, the Prusik Group and Goldman Sachs) was selected to build a mixed-use complex with 1,079 apartments, more than half permanently designated for low- to middle-income families. Using church records, Ms. Santiago was able to verify that she had lived in the neighborhood as a child. But her income was too low to qualify for any of the available apartments. So she asked her younger son, Carlos A. Hernandez, a cook at Russ & Daughters, if he would like to apply for a two-bedroom with her.

Technology,"Many Facial-Recognition Systems Are Biased, Says U.S. Study",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/facial-recognition-bias.html,"The majority of commercial facial-recognition systems exhibit bias, according to a study from a federal agency released on Thursday, underscoring questions about a technology increasingly used by police departments and federal agencies to identify suspected criminals. The systems falsely identified African-American and Asian faces 10 times to 100 times more than Caucasian faces, the National Institute of Standards and Technology reported on Thursday. Among a database of photos used by law enforcement agencies in the United States, the highest error rates came in identifying Native Americans, the study found. The technology also had more difficulty identifying women than men. And it falsely identified older adults up to 10 times more than middle-aged adults. The new report comes at a time of mounting concern from lawmakers and civil rights groups over the proliferation of facial recognition. Proponents view it as an important tool for catching criminals and tracking terrorists. Tech companies market it as a convenience that can be used to help identify people in photos or in lieu of a password to unlock smartphones.

Civil liberties experts, however, warn that the technology -- which can be used to track people at a distance without their knowledge -- has the potential to lead to ubiquitous surveillance, chilling freedom of movement and speech. This year, San Francisco, Oakland and Berkeley in California and the Massachusetts communities Somerville and Brookline banned government use of the technology. ""One false match can lead to missed flights, lengthy interrogations, watch list placements, tense police encounters, false arrests or worse,"" Jay Stanley, a policy analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union, said in a statement. ""Government agencies including the F.B.I., Customs and Border Protection and local law enforcement must immediately halt the deployment of this dystopian technology."" The federal report is one of the largest studies of its kind. The researchers had access to more than 18 million photos of about 8.5 million people from United States mug shots, visa applications and border-crossing databases. The National Institute of Standards and Technology tested 189 facial-recognition algorithms from 99 developers, representing the majority of commercial developers. They included systems from Microsoft, biometric technology companies like Cognitec, and Megvii, an artificial intelligence company in China. The agency did not test systems from Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google because they did not submit their algorithms for the federal study.

The federal report confirms earlier studies from M.I.T. that reported that facial-recognition systems from some large tech companies had much lower accuracy rates in identifying the female and darker-skinned faces than the white male faces. ""While some biometric researchers and vendors have attempted to claim algorithmic bias is not an issue or has been overcome, this study provides a comprehensive rebuttal,"" Joy Buolamwini, a researcher at the M.I.T. Media Lab who led one of the facial studies, said in an email. ""We must safeguard the public interest and halt the proliferation of face surveillance."" Although the use of facial recognition by law enforcement is not new, new uses are proliferating with little independent oversight or public scrutiny. China has used the technology to surveil and control ethnic minority groups like the Uighurs. This year, United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials came under fire for using the technology to analyze the drivers' licenses of millions of people without their knowledge. Biased facial recognition technology is particularly problematic in law enforcement because errors could lead to false accusations and arrests. The new federal study found that the kind of facial matching algorithms used in law enforcement had the highest error rates for African-American females. ""The consequences could be significant,"" said Patrick Grother, a computer scientist at N.I.S.T. who was the primary author of the new report. He said he hoped it would spur people who develop facial recognition algorithms to ""look at the problems they may have and how they might fix it."" But ensuring that these systems are fair is only part of the task, said Maria De-Arteaga, a researcher at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in algorithmic systems. As facial recognition becomes more powerful, she said, companies and governments must be careful about when, where, and how they are deployed. ""We have to think about whether we really want these technologies in our society,"" she said.","Algorithms falsely identified African-American and Asian faces 10 to 100 times more than Caucasian faces, researchers for the National Institute of Standards and Technology found.",c7c8cd8c-fc03-57eb-994f-8bec0b74b814,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/19/business/19facial/19facial-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=e3d66427f99ce212c6e96bba111a1cff219dad2a3f8812bf5e502bccfd614866&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Morning at Grand Central Terminal.

Health,Brain Stimulation Shows Promise in Treating Severe Depression,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/04/health/deep-brain-stimulation-depression.html,"For more than a decade, doctors have been using brain-stimulating implants to treat severe depression in people who do not benefit from medication, talk therapy or electroshock sessions. The treatment is controversial -- any psychosurgery is, given its checkered history -- and the results have been mixed. Two major trials testing stimulating implant for depression were halted because of disappointing results, and the approach is not approved by federal health regulators.

Now, a team of psychiatric researchers has published the first long-term result s, reporting Friday on patients who had stimulating electrodes implanted as long ago as eight years. The individuals have generally fared well, maintaining their initial improvements. The study, appearing in the American Journal of Psychiatry, was small, with just 28 subjects . Even still, experts said the findings were likely to extend interest in a field that has struggled.

""The most impressive thing here is the sustained response,"" Dr. Darin Dougherty, director of neurotherapeutics at Massachusetts General Hospital, said. ""You do not see that for anything in this severe depression. The fact that they had this many people doing well for that long, that's a big deal.""

The implant treatment is known as deep brain stimulation, or D.B.S., and doctors have performed it for decades to help people control the tremors of Parkinson's disease. In treating depression, surgeons thread an electrode into an area of the brain that sits beneath the crown of the head and is known to be especially active in people with severe depression. Running electrical current into that region, known as Brodmann Area 25, effectively shuts down its activity, resulting in relief of depression symptoms in many patients. The electrode is connected to a battery that is embedded in the chest. The procedure involves a single surgery; the implant provides continuous current from then on.","Years ago, more than two dozen patients received an electrical implant to counter their depression. They're still feeling better, a new study finds.",b938102a-ce52-5552-bc6d-f82382e4bbf5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/04/science/04DEPRESSION/04DEPRESSION-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=11076bc40dc9e03e100f55e1fbaea21d7374599a12e68942d51f551abd4bfd93&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"For years, electrodes implanted in the brain have helped people control the tremors of Parkinson's disease.

Music,'A Star Is Born' Soundtrack Gives Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper a No. 1 Album,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/15/arts/music/a-star-is-born-soundtrack-billboard.html,"Bradley Cooper, Willie Nelson's son and a real pop star masquerading as a fake pop star are among the musicians celebrating a chart-topping album this week.

The soundtrack to ""A Star Is Born,"" the remake in which Cooper plays the country-rock singer Jackson Maine and Lady Gaga co-stars as the Gaga-esque Ally, is No. 1 on the Billboard 200, selling a total of 231,000 album equivalent units, including streams, downloads and purchases. The album totaled 162,000 units in traditional sales and 48 million streams, according to Nielsen Music, easily topping the first-week sales for the oddly popular two-person band Twenty One Pilots.

""A Star Is Born"" was released by Interscope, doubling as both Lady Gaga's real label and as Ally's label in the film, which grossed about $28 million in its second week for an estimated box-office total so far of $94.2 million. The soundtrack features songs by its leading actors, along with songwriting contributions from Lukas Nelson, Jason Isbell, Mark Ronson, Diane Warren and Andrew Wyatt, from the band Miike Snow. With its rising hit single ""Shallow,"" the release also continues a run of blockbuster albums with movie tie-ins like ""The Greatest Showman"" and ""Black Panther: The Album,"" another Interscope release (overseen by Kendrick Lamar).

Your Money,Two Paths for Charitable Giving: From the Head or From the Heart,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/your-money/charitable-giving-from-head-or-heart.html,"Two Paths for Charitable Giving: From the Head or From the Heart

OUR dog Lucy died this week, and it got me thinking about the role she played in making both my wife and me more charitable. Lucy was a retired guide dog who, during her working life, gave birth to 32 puppies, many of whom also became guide dogs. My wife got involved with guide dogs by accident -- she saw a striking Labrador walking down Fifth Avenue and asked the person walking it for the breeder's name. Instead she heard about a program where volunteers take puppies for a year and train them in basic obedience before they're ready for formal training as guide dogs. When I came into the picture a few years later, my wife had trained several dogs before becoming a foster parent, as it were, for Lucy, a yellow Labrador who had been selected as breeding stock. As the years went on, we traveled back and forth to the foundation for Lucy to be bred and to whelp her puppies. We got to see how the school turned energetic puppies into well-trained guides. We also started to make larger donations. In 2007, we paid to sponsor a puppy, Ocho, from Lucy's last litter and then asked to train it.

When that year was up and we had to give him back, my heart would have been broken had I not seen the good these dogs do for people. Ocho is now guiding a young woman who sends us periodic updates. A few years ago, a friend asked if I'd like to become involved with another group that helps blind people achieve their full potential in life. I agreed and have been giving time and money since. Today, probably 90 percent of the money my wife and I give to charity each year goes to groups involved with helping the blind. Before Lucy came into my life, I didn't have a dog, know any blind people or think much about charity beyond writing a check to my alma mater's annual fund. In giving this way, we also unwittingly waded into one of the big debates among donors and their advisers: is it better to give in response to an emotional need or feeling, or are dollars better spent when tied to a metric that measures how effective they are?

Mr. Cerruti, who founded a Web site to link donors with nonprofits, said he never tried to presume why Mr. Skaggs gave the way he did, and felt it was something too personal to ask. ""He really cared about being a catalyst for opportunity primarily for those who would benefit the most from that opportunity,"" he said. We have been emotional givers from the start. It always seemed like a pure good to support groups that helped blind people. We've never looked at the ratings from Charity Navigator or GuideStar on either group. But we have followed closely what both organizations have done. We may have gotten lucky. ""The giving with the heart people, they may go wrong in trusting an organization that is not trustworthy,"" said Gene Tempel, founding dean of Indiana University's Lilly Family School of Philanthropy. ""One of the pieces of advice we give to people is get to know the organization. It means walking into the organization and asking questions. It means asking for a copy of an annual report."" Ani Hurwitz, who retired this week after 24 years of working at the New York Community Trust, said she came from a family of emotional givers. ""My father gave a lot to religious stuff because he was religious,"" she said. ""He was also a bleeding heart."" She recalled him crying as he watched the nightly news and then making a donation to a charity aimed at easing whatever troubling situation he had seen. Even though she has worked in philanthropy for decades and knows how to evaluate nonprofits, she said she was personally moved by stories more than measurements on the impact of her money. She gives money to Doctors Without Borders because she admires their courage in caring for people in war-ravaged places. She recently gave $250 to help buy a telescope for students in the Bronx because she thought it would be great for children who don't travel to gaze at the stars.

""I don't look at metrics,"" she said. ""Let's say we make a $75,000 grant to reduce poverty in Bushwick. Do you really think anyone can evaluate if our $75,000 did that? Or was it someone else's $75,000 grant? Can you even evaluate that?"" The other side of this debate would say that you not only can evaluate it, but you should. The desire to improve the world and quantify the process is a byproduct of the first Internet boom, Mr. Tempel said. Many big donors, like Bill Gates and Pierre Omidyar, founder of eBay, direct some or all of their giving with measurable criteria in mind. Eric Friedman, an actuary in Chicago who gives 10 percent of his income to charity, is not in their league. But he is determined to find the best way to make his dollars matter. He said this started more than a decade ago when he graduated from college and made his first charitable gift to a group of nuns who cared for children. ""I'm not Catholic, but I figured they'd be good at taking care of homeless children,"" he said. ""Then I started to get these letters and key chains, and the frequency made me think they're spending all of my money on fund-raising.""

He said he now based his personal giving on the ratings from GiveWell, a charity rating service that I have written about and that aims to find groups that make the next dollar donated to them count. Mr. Friedman said he was giving to a group that buys bed nets to prevent malaria in sub-Saharan Africa. Mr. Friedman said donors who give emotionally were like people who spend money on an expensive dinner. ""It's too focused on the donor so it will naturally not be focused on the most effective causes,"" he said. ""It's being directed by some other criteria. There is nothing wrong with that. I describe it as consumption."" Mr. Tempel said that it was fine to ask organizations to be accountable, but that it could go too far. ""People who follow their head looking at return on investment -- they will be most disappointed if they have unrealistic expectations on what is possible,"" he said. ""Some things are just difficult to deal with, like solving illiteracy in a community."" He said this was where nonprofits needed to tell donors what was measurable and what wasn't, to prevent frustration and disappointment on both ends. Of course, many philanthropic advisers stress that giving is not always this black and white: people need to get the emotional reward of giving first, but having a way to measure what those dollars do will sustain their giving. ""We feel that people do start with this heartfelt desire to do good and they have all the good intentions in the world,"" said Debra Treyz, global head of the philanthropy center at J. P. Morgan Private Bank. ""But giving dollars does not always translate into results."" She said she coached clients to focus on something they care about -- that's the heart part -- and then gain expertise in the field to be able to make more intelligent decisions. ""There are often ramp-up periods,"" she said. ""There's a little bit of trial and error around that. We need to acknowledge what we need to do better, learn from mistakes and move on.""",Is it better to give in response to an emotional need or based on how effective the contribution will be?,f9926dc4-70e6-5847-b547-ffdeccbc2d82,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/29/business/29wealth-web1/29wealth-web1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=397&w=600&s=b675a5cc2d06a0ecfb5671223f8d74583be62edb45d8a5bdaddae7ee86f45966&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Lucy inspired her owners to support a guide dog school.,f9926dc4-70e6-5847-b547-ffdeccbc2d82,N24News/imgs/f9926dc4-70e6-5847-b547-ffdeccbc2d82.jpg,21
Food,What to Cook Tonight,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/31/dining/what-to-cook-tonight.html,"Good morning. What a joy it is to sleep through these autumn nights, the windows cracked to chill the room, the curtains drawn against the sun that comes later each morning. I wake refreshed, eager to bring warmth into the lives of those around me. But first: Coffee, breakfast, chores. (Pity the northern suburbanites and those on rural roads, for the leaves are falling now, fast and piling deep.)

Jian bing, maybe, or weekday pancakes? You could do it! Fried eggs or a bagel smeared with cream cheese? Yes. I like serving no-recipe parfaits, myself, in the middle of the week: plain yogurt, sliced strawberries, bananas, more yogurt and a sprinkle of nuts or seeds across the top, if I don't have granola on hand. (Or you can't go wrong with Cheerios.)

It is Halloween tonight, of course, so dinner tonight may be complicated, the doorbell ringing and kids outside dressed as hamsters, Elsas, Holden Caulfields, ghosts looking for candy. So you might keep it simple, make takeout-style sesame noodles and slurp those down as you hand out the Charleston Chews.

You might. You could aim higher instead, and make Alison Roman's excellent new recipe for braised chicken thighs with tomatillo and radish (above). Or Melissa Clark's new stir-fry recipe, for green beans and spicy pork rice noodles. I'd like to cook those both, the blinds drawn and the front light extinguished so as to say nobody's home.","It's Halloween, and that may call for something simple, or you could aim higher with new recipes from Alison Roman, Melissa Clark and David Tanis.",ea7ee4c1-7375-50b0-a60f-8fe8bf68e521,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/31/dining/31Roman1-copy/31Roman1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bf38e3260f3c9333929688b2d0b5dc114843b1eb7ce70c1b4ac7b2b1d598e576&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Deeply savory chicken thighs with tomatillos, hominy, radishes, jalape&ntilde;o and lime, served with tortillas to sop up the sauce.",ea7ee4c1-7375-50b0-a60f-8fe8bf68e521,N24News/imgs/ea7ee4c1-7375-50b0-a60f-8fe8bf68e521.jpg,17
Opinion,Facebook and Twitter Must Do More About Trump's Tweets,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/opinion/trump-twitter-facebook.html,"While Twitter and Facebook dithered over whether to append warning labels on outrageous and dangerous posts from Donald Trump, the president continued to tweet and post.

Twitter took the plunge last week with a fact-checking link on two misleading and false tweets about mail-in voting and, later, an admonition that the president's tweet warning protesters that they risked being shot had violated its rules. Rather than blunt the president's message, the effect of Twitter's knuckle-rapping has been to draw even more attention to it.

Twitter executives deserve credit for at least calling out President Trump, even if it took them two years to finally decide to do so. Despite Twitter's measured approach, its solution only amplifies the problem. And Twitter's boss, Jack Dorsey, has fallen victim to the Streisand Effect, the internet phenomenon where attempts to censor or excise information instead backfire, causing the information to be cast even more widely.

Mark Zuckerberg, under the guise of free speech rights, has in the meantime given the president carte blanche to say what he pleases. Though he wrote he had a ""visceral negative reaction"" to the president's posts, Facebook ultimately left the posts up, warning-label free. ""Although the post had a troubling historical reference, we decided to leave it up because the National Guard references meant we read it as a warning about state action, and we think people need to know if the government is planning to deploy force,"" Mr. Zuckerberg posted on his personal Facebook page Friday.","Twitter is only bringing more attention to the president's tweets, and Facebook's strategy has been to do nothing.",4e642c21-3c41-5661-944e-c24a7fcf98f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/01/opinion/01bensingerWeb/01bensingerWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6c3884389f2f5ddfcbc8e050b104244fbe9e69756a9df4b2bf6248e3064b6853&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A protester outside Twitter's headquarters in San Francisco on Thursday.,4e642c21-3c41-5661-944e-c24a7fcf98f1,N24News/imgs/4e642c21-3c41-5661-944e-c24a7fcf98f1.jpg,11
Television,"Terry Jones, Monty Python Founder and Scholar, Is Dead at 77",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/arts/television/terry-jones-dead.html,"Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones was born in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, on Feb. 1, 1942, ""right bang slap in the middle of World War II,"" as he put it in ""The Pythons Autobiography.""





Terry Jones, who earned a spot in comedic lore as a member of the British troupe Monty Python and also had success as a director, screenwriter and author, died on Tuesday night at his home in the Highgate neighborhood of North London. He was 77. His ex-wife, Alison Telfer, confirmed the death. Mr. Jones announced in 2016 that he had primary progressive aphasia, a neurological disease that impairs the ability to communicate. Mr. Jones, four other Britons -- Michael Palin, Eric Idle, John Cleese and Graham Chapman -- and an American, Terry Gilliam, formed Monty Python in 1969. Their television sketch show, ""Monty Python's Flying Circus,"" became a phenomenon, first in Britain and then in the United States when it was rebroadcast there in the mid-1970s. The show worked a surreal brand of humor that was markedly different from most television fare. It led to ""And Now for Something Completely Different,"" a 1971 movie that was essentially a collection of skits from the TV show, and then several other feature films.

The popularity of the show soon made ""pythonesque"" an entry in the Oxford English Dictionary. ""The one thing we all agreed on, our chief aim, was to be totally unpredictable and never to repeat ourselves,"" Mr. Jones deadpanned to The New York Times in 2009, when the group had a rare reunion at the Ziegfeld Theater in New York. ""We wanted to be unquantifiable. That 'pythonesque' is now an adjective in the O.E.D. means we failed utterly."" Terence Graham Parry Jones was born in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, on Feb. 1, 1942, ""right bang slap in the middle of World War II,"" as he put it in ""The Pythons Autobiography,"" a 2003 book by the troupe with Bob McCabe. His father, Alick, was a banker by profession but was in the Royal Air Force at the time and stationed in Scotland. ""I suppose they must have been guarding the grouse,"" he wrote, ""although he used to say later that they were testing out this newfangled stuff called RADAR. He came and saw me when I was a week old, and was immediately posted to India. I would be 4 before he saw me again."" When he was 5 the family moved to Claygate, in the London suburbs. A favorite among the radio offerings he listened to was ""The Goon Show,"" a comedy program that often veered into offbeat territory and had a cast that included Peter Sellers. ""It was the surreality of the imagery and the speed of the comedy that I loved,"" he wrote in the ""Pythons"" book, ""the way they broke up the conventions of radio and played with the very nature of the medium.""

He was accepted at Oxford and agreed to attend. He almost changed his mind when Cambridge, which had put him on a waiting list, also accepted him, but he stuck with Oxford despite being intrigued by Cambridge's poetry program. That was a good decision, he later reckoned; otherwise ""I wouldn't have met either Mike Palin or Geoffrey Chaucer -- and without those two meetings the rest of my life would have been quite different."" He joined the university's Experimental Theater Club, known as E.T.C., spurning the more organized Oxford University Drama Society. He was also a decent scholar, something that he tapped later, but in ""The Pythons"" he recalled a moment in the library when, parsing some literary criticism, he realized that comedy and performing would take precedence. ""I suddenly thought, 'Why am I getting so emotionally outraged by what someone else has written about what someone else has written about what someone else originally wrote?'"" he recalled. ""'I'd rather do the original writing.'""

In 1963 he performed in and helped write his first revue, ""Loitering With Intent"" (""because it was done in a tent,"" he explained). Mr. Palin, a fellow Oxford student, contributed material to that show. Both also worked on ""Hang Down Your Head and Die,"" an E.T.C. show about capital punishment that, after its premiere at the university in 1963, went on to a six-week run at the Comedy Theater in the West End in 1964. The two also contributed to the 1964 edition of a show called ""The Oxford Revue,"" which was noticed by David Frost, who soon offered both Mr. Jones and Mr. Palin jobs writing for ""The Frost Report,"" a television sketch show that had its premiere in 1966 on the BBC. Mr. Chapman and Mr. Idle were also on the writing staff, and Mr. Cleese was in the cast. The next year Mr. Jones, Mr. Idle and Mr. Palin collaborated again on ""Do Not Adjust Your Set,"" a children's TV show full of comedic sketches that foreshadowed the Python style. Mr. Gilliam eventually contributed some animation. Though that show was aimed at children, it had a number of adult fans, including Mr. Cleese and Mr. Chapman.

And that, in 1969, was how ""Monty Python's Flying Circus"" came about. The name, though, was almost ""Owl Stretching Time"" or ""A Horse, a Spoon and a Basin."" Those were among numerous names bandied about for weeks, until time ran out and the troupe and the BBC, which was to broadcast the show, had to agree on something and finally did. ""I went back home and told my brother, We've got a title for the show, we're going to call it 'Monty Python's Flying Circus,'"" Mr. Jones later recalled. ""And he said, 'It'll never catch on.'"" The series, which made its debut in October 1969, consisted of absurdist sketches that often ignored the established rules of comedy -- the Pythons eschewed the punch line -- yet somehow spoke to the rampant illogic of life and society. A man writes a joke so funny that he dies laughing and it becomes a top-secret weapon of war. A game show host (played by Mr. Jones) gives contestants 15 seconds to summarize Proust's seven-volume ""In Search of Lost Time.""","In addition to being a charter member of the celebrated British sketch troupe, he was a director, a screenwriter and an authority on Chaucer.",01f4e470-975f-5d49-9c4a-5bddb813f1fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/23/obituaries/23jones/22jones-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=007a08f50c1b150a9945587a40bdb9e23af309f459341577ab37ed65187c6a99&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones was born in Colwyn Bay, North Wales, on Feb. 1, 1942, &ldquo;right bang slap in the middle of World War II,&rdquo; as he put it in &ldquo;The Pythons Autobiography.&rdquo;",01f4e470-975f-5d49-9c4a-5bddb813f1fc,N24News/imgs/01f4e470-975f-5d49-9c4a-5bddb813f1fc.jpg,3
Science,"Venus: Inhospitable, and Perhaps Instructional",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/18/science/venus-akatsuki-japan.html,"Venus is not a placid paradise -- that much we know. In addition to searing surface temperatures, wind in the upper atmosphere howls at up to 250 miles per hour, carrying clouds around the planet once every four days. Yet Venus itself spins very slowly: one rotation every 243 Earth days -- in the wrong direction, no less, opposite to almost every other body in the solar system. [Read about the search for life on Venus and the detction of phosphine in its clouds.] On the whole, the atmosphere on Earth rotates about the same speed as the planet. So why does the air on slow-spinning Venus speed around so much faster than the planet itself? The Japanese space probe Akatsuki, now in orbit around Venus, seeks to solve the mystery of so-called super-rotation. Scientists working on the mission are presenting some of their early findings at a meeting this week of the American Astronomical Society's Division for Planetary Sciences in Pasadena, Calif.

That is not just an idle trivia question for planetary scientists. Computer models of our own weather fail when applied to Venus, and knowledge of the planet's workings could better our understanding of Earth's. ""We don't know what is the missing point in meteorology,"" said Masato Nakamura, Akatsuki's project manager. ""If we know what makes such a super-rotation, we will have a much deeper understanding of the atmospheric dynamics, not just on Venus but also on Earth. We will learn much more about the Earth climate.""

The average surface temperature is more than 850 degrees Fahrenheit -- an extreme demonstration of the heat-trapping prowess of carbon dioxide, the primary constituent of the Venusian atmosphere. Clouds of sulfuric acid make it an even less appealing place to visit. In the 1990s, NASA's Magellan spacecraft precisely mapped the topography of Venus through radar. Except for a few flybys by spacecraft on the way to somewhere else, NASA has not returned to Venus, although the agency is considering two modest proposals. A European mission, Venus Express, studied the planet from 2006 to 2014, discovering among other things a frigid layer of atmosphere, minus 280 degrees Fahrenheit at an altitude of 75 miles, sandwiched between two warmer layers. But now Akatsuki, which entered orbit last December, has begun its work. Takehiko Satoh, one of the mission scientists, said that one of ""the most exciting, most surprising results"" so far came almost immediately after the spacecraft arrived.

The arc sits above Aphrodite Terra, a highland region about the size of Africa that rises up to three miles from the surface. Scientists working on data from the Venus Express reported a similar finding in July. One possibility is that as the wind blows over Aphrodite Terra, clouds are pushed higher and the temperature of the cloud tops falls. ""Our interpretation is there is some disturbance from the high mountain,"" Dr. Nakamura said. Dr. Satoh said there were primarily two competing ideas for where the energy for the Venus wind comes from. One is that energy coming from the sun accelerates the wind. The second is that atmosphere is so thick that it gradually slows down the spinning of the planet, and that angular momentum is transferred to the air. According to this theory, even though breezes on the surface are slight -- a couple of miles per hour -- the speeds increase at higher altitudes as the air thins.

""If the solar heating or thermal tide hypothesis is correct,"" Dr. Satoh said, ""we may see different propagation of the wave, from cloud top to the lower level."" If the viscosity theory is correct, the waves should propagate in the opposite direction, from the ground to the clouds. Perhaps the answers will become clear in a year -- or maybe four. ""We need to analyze a lot of big data,"" Dr. Nakamura said. That Akatsuki, which means ""dawn"" in Japanese, is there at all is the result of ingenuity and perseverance. It launched in May 2010 and arrived at Venus seven months later. But when its main engine failed to fire properly, it sailed right past the planet. ""It was a very sad moment,"" Dr. Satoh said. Within a day, Dr. Satoh said, calculations indicated that in six years, Akatsuki, in orbit around the sun instead of Venus, could meet up with Venus again. But it was not clear the spacecraft still would be able to slow down and enter orbit. An investigation found that a valve in the engine had leaked, leading to the formation of salts that fused it shut. The engine, as it fired, had overheated beyond repair.

Akatsuki still had the maneuvering thrusters that were to be used after it entered orbit. They were not as powerful as the broken engine, but they could apply enough force to slow it down enough so that Venus' gravity could capture it. Because of worries that the longer stay in space, with the bombardment of solar radiation and cosmic rays, would degrade the instruments, the craft was maneuvered so the second rendezvous would occur a year earlier, in November 2015. Then calculations suggested that orbit might not be stable, and the spacecraft might crash into Venus shortly afterward. Another adjustment pushed the arrival back a couple of weeks to Dec. 7, exactly five years after the original arrival date. The Akatsuki's orbit is different from the one originally envisioned. Instead of being synchronized to the spinning atmosphere, which would have allowed scientists to better track small changes, the spacecraft now loops around Venus in a large elliptical orbit. That provides different benefits. Instead of intently staring at one spot, seeing the smallest changes, scientists are now able to see what happens on a global scale, although they will miss some of the details. Akatsuki is to continue operating until at least April 2018, depending on how much fuel it has left. ""We know at least we have one kilogram of fuel,"" said Dr. Nakamura, likening the uncertainty to an imprecise fuel gauge in a car. If it turns out that Akatsuki has more, the spacecraft could continue operating for perhaps up to six years, he said.","It is hoped that a Japanese space probe, Akatsuki, orbiting Venus will provide insights that could help in understanding Earth's weather.",fce3a0de-4dd1-5932-8d3e-e848351bc8fd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/18/science/18VENUS/18VENUS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=c9dcf5a84576ad6bfc59179a73d5a5853d282308b340bcad4e95dd53774690ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A rendering of the Akatsuki probe, which is orbiting Venus seeking climate data.",fce3a0de-4dd1-5932-8d3e-e848351bc8fd,N24News/imgs/fce3a0de-4dd1-5932-8d3e-e848351bc8fd.jpg,2
Real Estate,"An Escape From Brooklyn, and a 'Couple's Project'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/realestate/an-escape-from-brooklyn-and-a-couples-project.html,"For years, Paul and Nathalie Schulhof scoured the countryside north of New York, searching for a weekend house that could serve as a rural escape from their home in Brooklyn Heights. But after coming close to buying a few homes, they decided to design their own, from scratch. ""We were looking at properties where there was always something that needed to be done,"" said Mr. Schulhof, 49. ""And in the conversations about the work we'd have to do for one place or another, it just became apparent that we were more excited about the idea of getting a lot and building on it."" And they were well positioned to do so. Mr. Schulhof is a partner at Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects, where he works on such large-scale, long-term projects as the Obama Presidential Center and the new U.S. Embassy in Mexico City.

After shifting their search from houses to lots, they found what appeared to be the ideal property in Kent, Conn. -- a vertiginous 8.5-acre expanse of overgrown forest. ""It's the highest peak in the Kent area, at 1,400 feet,"" said Dr. Schulhof, 49, a physician specializing in infectious diseases. From the top, she added, ""we get to see the sunset, the Catskills in the distance and the different layers of mountains."" The couple bought it in April 2016 for $150,000, and began making plans.

But after six months of effort, they decided their preliminary design was too inwardly focused. ""I wanted to have a house that was connected to the outdoors,"" Dr. Schulhof explained, ""and the first design was more hermetic, or more insulated from the outside."" This time, Mr. Schulhof took the lead in designing a 2,200-square-foot house resembling a low, single-story brick building, with glass corners and sliding-glass doors, and a broad roof extending out over a covered patio on one side. Two bedrooms, including the master suite, are on the ground floor. A second story is tucked up inside the standing-seam metal roof and contains Amelie's bedroom, an art studio and a writing studio. Mr. Schulhof initially designed a double-height space for a living room that would be open to the second floor, but Dr. Schulhof wanted a sense of separation, so they compromised on an enclosed light well that brings reflected sunlight into the living room without visually connecting the two levels. ""It was a bit like a three-dimensional puzzle, trying to fit it all together,"" Mr. Schulhof said.

He taught Amelie how to use the 3-D modeling software SketchUp, so she could work on the design of her room, which has a windowed nook for reading. Once the plans were set, they didn't have to look far for a contractor. A neighbor was building a house just down the road, and when they stopped to chat, they discovered the owner was Scott Mancini, a project manager at H & Y Construction.

""We ended up hiring them, and I worked with them to figure out how to make the design work with our budget,"" Mr. Schulhof said. Specifically, they refined the design so that the whole first floor could be built with standard wood framing, without expensive structural steel, and the top floor and roof could be built from a series of asymmetrical, prefabricated roof trusses. For the interiors, they kept the palette simple and installed white-oak flooring and an open kitchen with custom sapele wood cabinets that match the lumber used for the home's Duratherm windows. Petersen brick from Denmark, which Mr. Schulhof selected for its texture and variation, wraps from the outside to the inside around the fireplace.

After beginning construction in September 2018, running a driveway up the hill and blasting a hole in the rocky earth for a walkout foundation, H & Y finished building the house in less than a year -- just in time to hold Amelie's bat mitzvah last August -- for a total cost of about $780,000. ""We were a contractor and an architect, but now we're just neighbors,"" Mr. Schulhof said, noting that he and Mr. Mancini became friends along the way. Now that the family has moved in, the Schulhofs spend weekends cooking, reading, painting, writing and watching the landscape change with the seasons. But they also feel nostalgic about the process of creating a house together. ""It's a place to relax,"" Mr. Schulhof said. ""But I miss doing it.""

Movies,'The 24th' Review: The Story Behind a Mutiny,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/20/movies/the-24th-review.html,"This reliance on types rather than characters and signals over information -- Boston's intellect is established by a glimpse of him reading Booker T. Washington's autobiography -- is only one of the movie's difficulties. When the regiment finally mutinies against the violently racist police force (in what became known as the Houston Riot and resulted in the largest murder trial in American history), the sequence should feel cathartic and moving. Instead, it's confusingly indistinct, the action so murky it's sometimes difficult to tell who is firing on whom.

Mixing fact with fiction, Willmott and Byers's screenplay feels compressed and a little corny (as when the camera glides upward from the scene of a horrible beating to land on the American flag), the leads bearing so much weight of history they can barely breathe. A touching Aja Naomi King, as Boston's love interest, is little more than a sketch, and the skilled Mykelti Williamson suffers a similar fate as a wily sergeant who understands all too well the likely consequences of their revolt.

Shot in just 18 days, ""The 24th"" is a movie desperately in need of nuance. Despite Byers's attempts to humanize his rigidly upstanding character, it's really McRae we need to watch: In too few scenes, he gives Walker the intensity of an unexploded bomb, his fury the vivid point of a film with so much death, yet far too little life.

Sports,Players' Alliance Gets $10 Million From M.L.B. and Union to Build Diversity,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/sports/baseball/mlb-players-alliance.html,"Major League Baseball and the players' union have pledged $10 million to the Players Alliance, a nonprofit formed this summer by more than 100 current and former Black players in the wake of George Floyd's death, aiming to help build Black participation in the sport, from front offices to the diamond. The donation, which was officially announced Monday morning, will be dispersed annually over five years, financing initiatives including a player-led mentorship program, a program meant to recruit Black students to internships in the sport and another meant to donate baseball equipment to Black groups in need throughout the country. Curtis Granderson, 39, the president of the Players Alliance and a former outfielder whose 16-year career included stints with the Detroit Tigers, Yankees and Mets, called the money ""amazing,"" in part because the nonprofit was formalized only 12 weeks ago. ""M.L.B. and the union have rolled out programs historically, and some have been great and some have obviously needed to have a little bit of assistance to them,"" he said in a telephone interview this weekend. ""We, as the players -- the market you have been targeting -- some of us have gone through these programs or have started very similar programs, so we can be a great resource to take the programs that are already good and make them better, or introduce some new ones.""

The idea for the Players Alliance came this summer when Cameron Maybin, a 33-year-old Chicago Cubs outfielder, saw a video of N.F.L. players saying, ""Black lives matter,"" and listing victims of police brutality, including Floyd. (The majority of players in the N.F.L. are Black.)
* None
* Everyone Loves Ohtani: The Angels' two-way star was a unanimous pick for A.L. M.V.P. and his superfans redefine devotion.
* Phillie Phavorite: Bryce Harper truly committed to Philadelphia and now he's back on top of baseball, winning the N.L. M.V.P.
* Cy Young Winners: Milwaukee's Corbin Burnes and Toronto's Robbie Ray had hit rock bottom before they worked their way up to stardom.
* Baseball Is Stuck in Neutral: The potential of a lockout has a star-studded group of free agents waiting for the dust to settle.
* Free-Agency Tracker: Get the latest updates on signings, contract extensions and trades. Realizing that little had been said within baseball on the same topics, Maybin reached out to one of his closest friends, Dee Strange-Gordon of the Seattle Mariners, and talked about getting the few Black players in baseball to take part in a video of their own, which they did in June with the help of the former pitcher Edwin Jackson. Maybin said Black players in baseball have felt handcuffed because there are so few of them and they feared repercussions for speaking out. ""In the past, it's like: 'Hey, you don't need to touch social or political issues. You just need to be a role model at baseball camps,'"" he said in a telephone interview. By making the video, Maybin said Black players realized there was strength in numbers. He added, ""If we all speak up and we all feel strongly about what's going on in our communities, we all can be the voices for our communities."" Granderson said making the video, the interest it garnered and subsequent conversations among Black players, which brought them together more than ever, led to the formation of the nonprofit. They resolved to pool their efforts to tackle problems they saw. (In the past, their community service efforts were fragmented; a survey of Players Alliance members found that they had donated over $40 million over recent years on their own.) As the group grew and began programs like mentorship of young Black players and students, Granderson said, M.L.B. and the union reached out to ask how they could get involved.

""The biggest value that we have in the Players Alliance is us, the players,"" Maybin said. ""It's not somebody speaking for us. We are the face."" The donation from M.L.B. and the union was timely: Granderson said the Players Alliance had no money in its bank account before the pledge. The $10 million will allow the group to expand and formalize more initiatives; Maybin said he had recently discussed with his former Yankees teammate C. C. Sabathia, the Players Alliance vice president, how to help finance youth travel teams, because playing baseball is expensive. In a statement, M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred said the league believed the efforts of the Players Alliance ""will complement existing diversity initiatives and accelerate progress."" The players' union chief Tony Clark added in a statement: ""Recent events and social unrest have profoundly crystallized the need for prescriptive programs and additional education designed to enhance Black participation at all levels of baseball for the betterment of our game as well as society."" There were only 67 Black players on opening day major-league rosters this season, with a smaller share of representation in several other areas of the sport. While M.L.B.'s own efforts have gradually reached more underserved and underrepresented youth players -- for example, two 2020 first-round picks, Ed Howard of the Cubs and Jordan Walker of the St. Louis Cardinals, both of whom are Black, are alumni of diversity development programs -- the rate of Black players in the major leagues has dwindled from a high of around 19 percent in the early 80s to about 8 percent now. There are only two Black major-league managers (Dave Roberts of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Dusty Baker of the Houston Astros), two Black heads of baseball operations (Michael Hill of the Miami Marlins and Kenny Williams of the Chicago White Sox) and just one Black C.E.O. or team president (Derek Jeter of the Miami Marlins). There are no Black majority owners. ""We don't want charity cases, but we have seen historically that there have been individuals that are qualified for some of these positions,"" Granderson said. Details are still being ironed out, but Granderson said the Players Alliance hoped to pay for or help set up young Black men or women with entrees into the sport, from front offices to coaching staffs to apparel company positions.",The money is a substantial boost to the 12-week-old group formed by current and former players to increase Black participation at all levels of the sport.,e89e6d2a-4180-5753-a5e9-27dbc52ee24f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/21/sports/21playersalliance/21playersalliance-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7b2e245d8c2c9e00c9835e21cb25d7d36b98756445b51bea42e93934b2449f1f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dee Gordon and Cameron Maybin in 2018.

Opinion,She Helped a Customer in Need. Then U.S. Bank Fired Her.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/opinion/sunday/us-bank-fired-employee.html,"To understand how some companies have lost their souls, consider what happened after U.S. Bank stiffed a customer before Christmas. Marc Eugenio had deposited a $1,080 paycheck into his account at U.S. Bank. The bank put a hold on most of the sum, and he spent many hours in a branch office over two days, trying to get access to the money so he could buy presents for his 9-year-old daughter and 13-year-old son. On Christmas Eve, Eugenio found himself parked at a gas station in Clackamas, Ore., a Portland suburb, both his fuel gauge and his bank balance on empty. A bank employee had told him that money would soon show up in his account -- perhaps a ruse to get him out of the branch office. For hours Eugenio then tried his debit card at the gas pump, so he could buy a few gallons and get home to his wife and children. ""I was stranded,"" he told me. ""I could have walked home, but it would have been five miles in the cold.""

He telephoned the bank's toll-free number and spoke with Emily James, a senior officer at a call center in Portland. She spent an hour on the phone with Eugenio, trying to get some money released so he could at least get home. She soon realized that he had been misled, and that money wouldn't reach his account any time soon. Feeling bad for a customer stuck on Christmas Eve, James offered to drive over from her call center and personally hand him $20. ""No, no, no,"" Eugenio told her. He couldn't impose. But she suggested she could use her break, and she received permission from a supervisor to drive 20 minutes to Eugenio. She later recalled that when she arrived, she wished him Merry Christmas and handed him $20 of her own money. ""Twenty dollars wouldn't break me,"" she explained to me, ""and it would enable him to get home to his family."" When U.S. Bank found out that it had such a generous employee, what did it do? It fired her. ""She broke the rules, putting herself and the bank at unnecessary risk,"" U.S. Bank said in a statement. The company bars call center workers from meeting customers, so it dismissed both her and the manager who had approved her trip. The manager, Abigail Gilbert, told me that James's account was essentially correct. James had worked at the bank since 2017 and had received numerous commendations and awards that I examined, but the bank paid her no severance. She is single and used her last paycheck to buy sacks of food for her two dogs, Domino and Harley Quinn. She is now reduced to selling blood plasma, at $25 a visit.

""I won't let myself be homeless,"" she told me. Eugenio is horrified at what happened. ""I was lied to and treated like dirt"" by the bank, Eugenio said, and he can't understand why the bank axed the one employee who was helpful. ""I felt really bad,"" he told me. ""How could she get fired?"" U.S. Bank's vision statement boasts: ""Our employees are empowered to do the right thing."" So I tried to ask the company's C.E.O., Andrew Cecere, why the bank fired an employee who, with permission, rescued a frustrated customer on Christmas Eve.

Cecere wouldn't return my calls. David Palombi, a bank spokesman, told me that an internal ""investigation"" had concluded that James misled her manager to get permission, that James could have found other ways to get money to Eugenio, that the $20 came from the manager (which Gilbert confirmed to me) and that James previously had disciplinary ""issues."" I found the bank's ""investigation"" a whitewash and its explanations to be incoherent, meanspirited and contradicted by a series of internal bank messages that I reviewed. The bottom line is this: Cecere, who was paid $14.1 million in 2018, presides over a company that has smeared a much-decorated employee who helped a customer and as a result survives by selling blood plasma. I suggest Cecere apologize, reinstate James and promote her; he might also show contrition by selling his own blood plasma and donating the proceeds to a charity of James's choosing. When young Americans say in polls that they react more positively to ""socialism"" than to ""capitalism,"" it's because of the hypocrisy of institutions like U.S. Bank. I've often noted that companies have enormous capacity to help their communities. But too often they act like American tobacco companies, which killed more people than Stalin did, or pharma companies peddling opioids, or McKinsey & Company advising a business to ""get more patients on higher doses of opioids,"" or Boeing mocking regulators. That's one reason to seek stronger private-sector labor unions: At least unions and corporations can then provide some check on each other.","This from a company that says employees should ""do the right thing.""",f9e62403-6168-55d7-b6d8-99b94f92d631,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/02/opinion/02kristof1/02kristof1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=69dd43b21052b4ccb555c218260901c3713f43f98d9e47f597b3a6ea92fe4e8e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Emily James and Harley Quinn, an emotional support dog.",f9e62403-6168-55d7-b6d8-99b94f92d631,N24News/imgs/f9e62403-6168-55d7-b6d8-99b94f92d631.jpg,11
Automobiles,Premature Retirement? Old-Car Owners Bristle at Proposed Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/automobiles/old-car-owners-bristle-at-proposed-ban.html,"TIMELESS The Citroen DS, a landmark design, may not always have Paris because of a proposal to ban vehicles made before 1997 to help reduce the city's air pollution.

BY proposing to reduce air pollution by banning vehicles made before 1997, Mayor Bertrand Delanoe has angered vintage car owners and motorist groups and raised concerns among those who say they cannot afford new cars. Mr. Delanoe's proposal is part of a wider push by local authorities to comply with European regulations and establish a low-emission zone around metropolitan Paris, including many suburbs, by 2014. The plan would extend the mayor's efforts to make the city more pedestrian-friendly by reducing the number of cars. These efforts include introducing the Velib' bicycle rental program, establishing the Autolib' electric-car rental system and cutting vehicle traffic along the banks of the Seine. Mr. Delanoe has been mayor since 2001, but will not run again in 2014. ""In Paris, where polluting industries have nearly disappeared, cars are the main source of pollution today,"" he said in a statement presenting the antipollution plan to city councilors. But the ban would include many of the most recognizably French cars, including the Citroen 2CV, known as the Deux Chevaux; the Citroen DS, celebrated for its clean, distinctive design; the Renault 4L, a practical Everyman's car of the 1960s and '70s; and many classic Peugeots.

The mayor's critics say he is doing everything he can, in his last years in office, to discourage driving. Among the disgruntled are collectors, who fear they won't be able to take their vintage cars for a spin. ""For me the 2CV is part of French heritage, of Parisian heritage,"" said Xavier Audran, 44, who lives in the 20th arrondissement and owns a Citroen CX, several 2CVs and a motorbike -- all of which would fall under the proposed ban. ""I wouldn't be able to leave my home with my vehicles."" The ban would apply to private and commercial vehicles that would be older than 17 years in 2014 and therefore do not comply with existing European standards for the tailpipe emissions that cause smog. A spokesman for the city estimated that 367,000 cars would be affected. Also targeted are heavy trucks older than 18 years and motorcycles older than 10. The plan to set up low-emission zones here and in other volunteer cities was initiated by the previous center-right government. But the current French ecology minister, Delphine Batho, said in September that the plan had been rushed through to avoid European sanctions and needed to be overhauled.

A ministerial council in January is to flesh out the legislative details of the low-emission zone and the old-car ban, which the mayor does not have the power to enforce. But Mr. Delanoe, a prominent Socialist, has strong allies in the national government. Other measures in the antipollution plan include applying new speed limits on the beltway that surrounds the city and in the city itself. ""This measure goes in the right direction, because these vehicles pollute much more than recent vehicles, especially for nitrogen oxide and diesel exhaust particles,"" said Karine Leger, assistant director at Airparif, an independent organization that monitors air quality in the Paris region. She said that car traffic had been cut by 25 percent over the last decade and that air quality had improved. Julien Bargeton, deputy mayor in charge of transportation, said the city needed to move past the car. ""In a dense city, the car can't be the favored transportation mode,"" he said. ""There is room for cars in the city of tomorrow, but they can't take up all the room, as they do today, with public spaces that are widely reserved to car traffic, even though 60 percent of Parisians don't own a vehicle."" But opponents of the proposal argue that it will disproportionately affect poorer suburban households unable to replace the old cars they use to commute to Paris. They say the mayor's proposal to couple the ban with social support measures -- like a free six-month Autolib' subscription or a cash for clunkers program -- isn't realistic. Jean-Francois Legaret, a center-right city councilor and the mayor of the city's first arrondissement, said a cash for clunkers program wouldn't fall under the mayor's control. ""And the ""Autolib' doesn't offer the same flexibility of use as a private vehicle,"" he added. Pierre Chasseray, director general of 40 Million Motorists, an auto club with 320,000 members, agreed. ""There has to be an economic incentive,"" he said, arguing that any cash for clunkers rebate should apply to used cars as well as new models.

Motorist lobbies say the city authorities are intentionally trying to make it impossible for cars to circulate freely and fluidly here. ""The mayor is betting that one day people will be so disgusted with their car that they won't use it anymore,"" Mr. Chasseray said. ""But he is completely wrong -- we will always need vehicles."" Other cities have age restrictions on cars, including Berlin, where for two years diesel vehicles have been outlawed if they do not meet emission regulations enacted in 2005. In Singapore since 1990, residents have to bid to buy a Certificate of Entitlement, which enables them to own a motor vehicle for 10 years, after which they are forced to scrap the car, export it or pay to extend the certificate.","By proposing to reduce air pollution with a ban on vehicles made before 1997, the mayor of Paris has angered vintage car owners and motorist groups.",fbc7ed32-8b07-5616-93bf-5e2cf7e78513,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/25/automobiles/25PARI/25PARI-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=2ca5444fef1a45ac989f62104ad33e65f108bf0ccc478d55316ef738760d88ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"TIMELESS The Citroën DS, a landmark design, may not always have Paris because of a proposal to ban vehicles made before 1997 to help reduce the city's air pollution.",fbc7ed32-8b07-5616-93bf-5e2cf7e78513,N24News/imgs/fbc7ed32-8b07-5616-93bf-5e2cf7e78513.jpg,23
Music,Nicki Minaj and Travis Scott Fumble Toward Yesterday's Prize: A No. 1 Album,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/20/arts/music/nicki-minaj-travis-scott-queen-astroworld.html,"On Sunday afternoon, Nicki Minaj went on Twitter to go over some matters of accounting. Moments earlier, Billboard reported that Travis Scott's ""Astroworld"" was the No. 1 album in the United States for the second week running, relegating Ms. Minaj's ""Queen,"" her fourth studio album, to No. 2 in its debut week. ""I spoke to him,"" she tweeted, referring to Mr. Scott. ""He knows he doesn't have the #1 album this week. I love my fans for the #1 album in AMERICA!"" What incensed Ms. Minaj was a boost in sales Mr. Scott had received by bundling his album with merchandise and tour packages, and also an Instagram post by Mr. Scott's paramour, Kylie Jenner, ""telling ppl to come see her & Stormi,"" Ms. Minaj tweeted. (Stormi is Mr. Scott and Ms. Jenner's baby daughter.) But that wasn't it. For about an hour, Ms. Minaj -- whose album sales were supported by similar packages -- listed her gripes: Billboard chart chicanery, Spotify blackballing, record-label spinelessness. Her complaints about how those alleged actions affected the rollout (and subsequent chart position) of ""Queen"" -- which she later brushed off as ""sarcasm/dry humor"" -- were implicitly tied to Ms. Minaj's broader belief that, as a female rapper, she has not fully gotten her due.

[Nicki Minaj has canceled her fall North American tour. Read more here.] No one is entitled to a No. 1 album, and in general, record labels and artists try to strategize release dates to maximize their chances. For the past two months, most people have stayed out of the way of Drake's ""Scorpion,"" which had a five-week run at No. 1. Mr. Scott bumped him from the top a week ago. Presumably, Ms. Minaj expected to dethrone Mr. Scott (and next week, be dethroned herself by labelmate and collaborator Ariana Grande). But it wasn't to be. Still, the resulting pyrotechnics obscure a far bleaker truth, which is that this fleeting battle for album-chart supremacy -- itself a metric that's becoming increasingly irrelevant -- is between two artists preoccupied with the album format who are not especially well-suited to it. For Ms. Minaj, a classically skilled rapper fired in the kiln of New York mixtape rap and one of the last true crossover hip-hop superstars, an album is an opportunity to show off, to wear different guises, to make a grand statement. It's a declaration of pomp and range. That's what it is for Mr. Scott as well, but his approach is almost opposite. He is often less present on his own album than all of the guests he gathers. The sum total is impressive, almost overwhelming, but it says little about Mr. Scott on his own.

There is ""Bed,"" a blithe soft-R&B collaboration with Ms. Grande; ""Come See About Me,"" a ballad that sounds like it were written for Faith Hill; and ""Thought I Knew You,"" a listless pairing with the Weeknd. There is ""Majesty,"" an overbearing collaboration with Eminem -- to be fair, one of the only rappers who can match Ms. Minaj's theatricality -- that extends for an uncomfortably long period of time. And there's ""Nip Tuck"" and ""Hard White,"" songs where Ms. Minaj's vocals are buried under digital effects -- an effort to keep up with the sounds of the moment that ends up distracting from her familiar commandeering presence. [Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder.] As ""Queen"" makes clear, Ms. Minaj is a far better rapper than a singer, and a far better writer of rhymes than melodies. Her most muscular moments are her best here: the lightheartedly savage ""LLC""; a pointed collaboration with Foxy Brown, ""Coco Chanel""; and ""Chun-Li,"" full of casually ferocious bars, on which Ms. Minaj doesn't break a sweat. And of course, there's ""Barbie Dreams,"" a buoyant remake of the Notorious B.I.G.'s ""Just Playing (Dreams),"" a lewd rundown of his sexual fantasies about female R&B singers that verges on offense but was so skillfully executed it didn't cross the line. The song is a crucial moment in 1990s New York rap, and Ms. Minaj does not take her inversion of the classic -- which targets male rappers -- lightly, delivering it with verve and also a fair bit of comedy. That Ms. Minaj is so much more effective in this mode is only underscored by the songs in which she abandons it. ""Queen"" aspires to solve multiple problems at once, but winds up emphasizing a whole new one: the continuing fuzziness of her artistic identity. Here again, she has something in common with Mr. Scott. He is hard to pin down on ""Astroworld,"" which may be the best of his studio albums but, like the ones before it, serves largely as testimony to his sense of scale and arrangement, and less as an affirmation of his technical skill.

The list of guests is long and borderline preposterous: a bracing Frank Ocean on ""Carousel,"" Drake on ""Sicko Mode,"" an effective tag team of Juice WRLD and Sheck Wes on ""No Bystanders,"" an ethereally blissful pairing of Gunna and Nav on ""Yosemite."" ""Stop Trying to be God"" features vocals from James Blake, Kid Cudi and Earth, Wind & Fire's Philip Bailey, and harmonica from Stevie Wonder. Mr. Scott is on there, too, but there is a cardboard blankness to his vocal texture. Even all the layers of processing it's run through don't enliven it. That is a constant throughout this album, which is both excitingly ambitious and curiously hollow at the core. Mr. Scott has had some indelible singles over the years -- ""Pick Up the Phone,"" ""Butterfly Effect,"" ""Goosebumps"" -- but over the length of an album, he recedes. The 17-track ""Astroworld"" is as long as it is merely to show off all the guests he can attract. He also makes albums for an old-fashioned reason: to win prizes. In a recent interview with Rolling Stone, Mr. Scott's A&R representative, Sickamore, described the glut of nontraditional guests on ""Astroworld"" as an arrow targeted right at the Grammys. What Mr. Scott does have is a sense of hip-hop as a fully immersive performance. His live concerts are creative and enthusiastically rowdy. His aesthetic sense is highly refined. Unlike Ms. Minaj, for whom hip-hop is first and foremost about rapping, Mr. Scott understands hip-hop primarily as a lifestyle. (Some of that has to do with age -- Ms. Minaj is 35, Mr. Scott is 26 -- and generational shifts.) His album is an opportunity for music, yes, but also for merchandise that is whimsical and maximal, just like his shows. For Mr. Scott, the album is a pretense, a necessary step in between him and the exuberant presentation that is his true gift. But albums aren't for everyone. This tussle over Billboard chart dominance -- never mind that Ms. Minaj is judging her first week against Mr. Scott's second -- feels especially futile given that it's between artists who could probably continue to thrive without them. Ms. Minaj's celebrity is secure. Mr. Scott has figured out how to embody modern hip-hop while bypassing the usual steppingstones. For both, the album is an albatross, not an answer.","""Queen"" and ""Astroworld"" are the products of two rappers who are preoccupied with the album format, but aren't especially well-suited to it.",db88c8a1-b8c9-5022-8da9-cb1654a98c85,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/21/arts/21nickitravis1/21nickitravis1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=39b83c6a0dccf6e523d9ccc4833e5cf1e5a6352d0a5bac8e8ce39315341d3c72&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Nicki Minaj is a classically skilled rapper who sees albums as a chance to show off her different guises.,db88c8a1-b8c9-5022-8da9-cb1654a98c85,N24News/imgs/db88c8a1-b8c9-5022-8da9-cb1654a98c85.jpg,12

Sports,Rockets' Danuel House Leaves N.B.A. Bubble After Violation,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/sports/basketball/nba-houston-rockets-danuel-house.html,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- The N.B.A. announced Friday that Danuel House Jr., a reserve forward for the Houston Rockets, had breached the league's health and safety protocols by inviting an unauthorized guest to his hotel room and that he would be leaving the Walt Disney World campus, where the league has made a major investment to finish out its season inside its so-called bubble.

House did not play for the Rockets in Games 3 and 4 of their Western Conference semifinal series against the Los Angeles Lakers this week as the league conducted its investigation. The N.B.A. concluded that the guest, who was not identified by the league, had spent ""multiple hours"" in House's hotel room at the Grand Floridian Resort & Spa on Tuesday, in direct violation of league rules. The league has stringent policies about who can be on campus -- or even interact with the players -- as it seeks to insulate itself from the coronavirus pandemic.

The league said in a statement that ""no evidence was found that other players or staff had contact with the guest or were involved in this incident"" and that House ""will not participate with the Rockets team in additional games this season.""

Style,Why Do We Care So Much About Diana's Dresses?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/style/crown-diana-dresses.html,"And so, once again, to Princess Diana. Like Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, she has become a sort of cultural Rosetta Stone we return to over and over, seeking to discover answers to our own choices in her limpid blue stare and cacophonous, attention-grabbing wardrobe. This time around the re-examination comes courtesy of ""The Crown,"" Season 4, a.k.a. the Diana Season. The scrutiny has been building since the 20th anniversary of the princess's death in 2017, when Virgil Abloh declared Diana his Off-White muse and Kensington Palace held an exhibition devoted to her outfits. And though it got a boost last year with a new musical (with costumes by William Ivey Long and a featured song titled ""The Dress"") that was supposed to be headed to Broadway, the chatter reached a fresh apogee this weekend with the release of the Netflix show. The one where the princess, in the form of the actress Emma Corrin, catches the Windsor eye, makes her public debut, gets married and miserable, develops an eating disorder and becomes a Fashion Icon nonetheless. The one that inspired British Vogue to put Ms. Corrin on the cover of its October issue in a sapphire blue Oscar de la Renta taffeta ball gown with the headline ""Queen of Hearts."" The one that has been the subject of a 3-D virtual show at the Brooklyn Museum, ""The Queen and the Crown,"" featuring assorted items from the series's costume department, including a raspberry floral two-piece dress made for the princess's Australian tour and the remake of that famous meringue of an overblown wedding dress.

After all, if there's one thing ""The Crown"" does with its fealty to the clothes that were, it is to show how cringe-worthy some of those fashion moments actually were. (Amy Roberts, the costume designer, has said that she didn't recreate them exactly but rather tried to capture their essence, just as Peter Morgan, the show's creator, talks about his allegiance to historical truth over accuracy.) The pie-crust collars and sailor bibs and pussy bows. The frumpy, Laura Ashley puff-sleeve smocks and midi-skirts. The novelty knitwear. The Easter egg overalls and gingham. The saccharine mash-up of romance and posh schlubbiness teetering delicately between pastoral and kitsch before blossoming into pure Disney fantasy: taffeta, velvet, iridescent blues -- the frumpy duckling turning into a polka-dot-and-silk-swathed swan. Right now, understandably, we can't get enough of such vicarious fashion exposition, given our loungewear-limned reality. The hazy, sentimental lens of nostalgia can make even the pretty bad delicious, in an ironic, self-aware way. Rowing Blazers has already rereleased Diana's famous black sheep sweater -- the one she wore to a couple of her husband's polo matches -- to so much hoo-ha that even at $295 it is available for order only and will not arrive until January at the earliest. And this is only Diana, Episode 1.

The famous shirred black ""revenge dress"" the princess wore to a gala in 1994, the same evening her husband confessed his affair to the BBC, and the more body-con designer outfits of her divorce years are still to come, perhaps in Season 5. As are the John Galliano-designed Dior slip dress worn to the Met gala in 1996 and the Versace column worn on a tour of Australia the same year. Ditto the simpler button-ups and chinos that became the uniform of her humanitarian work. And the tragedy that froze her in time.

Plus, there's yet another Diana project, the feature film ""Spencer,"" starring Kristen Stewart, waiting in the wings. Despite all of this, Alexandra Shulman, the editor of British Vogue during Diana's heyday and current contrarian columnist for The Daily Mail, wrote in a recent piece, ""Princess Diana was dazzling, but it's nonsense to claim she was a fashion inspiration."" It sounds like sacrilege. But she's right. Diana didn't send designers or fans spinning out in new directions because she put her clothes together in an especially creative inventive way, or because she gravitated toward the outre and imaginative, which she then wore with such elan that she left a trail of ideas in her wake. (Indeed, she was introduced to fashion by Anna Harvey, then the deputy editor of British Vogue and Diana's designer conduit, who does not appear to be part of ""The Crown"" cast of characters.) Diana wasn't one of those public figures with an identifiable and consistent personal style, though she clearly loved to get dressed.

Rather, the greatest trend she ever set -- bigger than the fad for engagement rings with oval sapphires surrounded by diamonds, or the biggest of her big shoulders -- was as the original fashion reality TV star: a public figure who used her clothes as a personal weather vane, not to advance the agenda of state but for direct communication to the outside world, even when she was simply smiling and standing by. She wore her emotions not just on, but as, her sleeves. And because we could all see them, we could all relate.","""The Crown,"" Season 4, has raised the question again.

Dance,"Review: 'Badke,' a Contemporary Spin on an Arabic Folk Dance",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/arts/dance/review-badke-a-contemporary-spin-on-an-arabic-folk-dance.html,"""Badke"" begins in the dark, where signs of life are heard, not seen. But neither the setting nor the subject matter leaves you unaware for long. As the stage reverberates with the sound of punctuated stomps, claps and the occasional whoop, the lights slowly illuminate the scene: 10 dancers with their backs to us hopping in sync. Who doesn't love a good folk dance?

Taking inspiration from the dabke, an Arabic folk dance, the production is more than a folk dance, both to its credit and its detriment. This United States premiere, a collaboration among the Belgian groups Les Ballets C de la B and KVS, and the Palestine cultural organization A.M. Qattan Foundation, features 10 Palestinian dancers, who perform with such gusto that they have trouble showing the nuances in more subtle, still moments. But even though their eagerness is palpable, this production aims for something more experimental: to give the dabke a contemporary spin by embellishing it with other forms, like ballet, hip-hop, circus arts and capoeira.

Unfortunately, energy can't be everything in a dance, and ""Badke"" makes its point early on -- that dance is not unlike freedom -- and then keeps repeating it. The production, performed at New York Live Arts on Thursday, is part of the institution's Live Ideas festival, which this year broadened its focus on the Middle East and North Africa.

In ""Badke,"" lights dim and brighten and the music fades in and out in what is surely a reference to faulty electricity, a signal to hard times. Numerous solos spotlight acrobatic back flips and grand jetes, yet these dancers look best when they link arms and sweep around the stage in fleet-footed folk dances. Directed and choreographed by Koen Augustijnen and Rosalba Torres Guerrero of Les Ballets C de la B and Hildegard De Vuyst of KVS, ""Badke"" feels packaged and tour-ready -- more Belgian than Palestinian -- and doesn't shy away from political themes.","Inspired by the dabke, a popular Arabic dance, this production is more than a folk dance, both to its credit and its detriment.",81bf62fb-3d3d-5cbd-8ff4-79692caf342c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/13/arts/13BADKE/13BADKE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=aaf8869a8e26fb7fd83f38c1a28f66ee8d208c6a3a9c82f905153252304f5f78&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left at the back, Maali Maali, Salma Ataya, Aseel Qupti and other Palestinian dancers in ""Badke"" at New York Live Arts.",81bf62fb-3d3d-5cbd-8ff4-79692caf342c,N24News/imgs/81bf62fb-3d3d-5cbd-8ff4-79692caf342c.jpg,6

Music,"Metropolitan Opera, Facing Sharp Losses, Furloughs Dozens",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/05/arts/music/metropolitan-opera-coronavirus.html,"In addition to the 41 furloughed staff members, 11 others will be cut to part-time hours, out of an administration of 237 people. Those furloughed will receive two weeks of pay and, like the unionized orchestra, chorus and stagehands, will retain their health benefits. The affected employees are spread across the company's departments, including artistic affairs, production and marketing.

Mr. Gelb said he had told the staff that he did not envision further cuts, at least through the summer. But in the interview he added that the Met's financial picture was complicated by not knowing when operations might resume, and by the likelihood that recovery would be slow, even after reopening.

""It's very difficult to budget when you have so many uncertainties of timetable,"" he said. ""The performing arts are going to be the last business to return. We're still selling tickets for next season, but obviously the fall is in jeopardy at this point. Hard decisions will need to be made in the coming weeks about the opening. Perhaps by some miraculous situation we can return in the fall.""

When the Met announced in March that it would cancel the remaining eight weeks of its season, Mr. Gelb said that he would forgo his salary until operations returned to normal, and that senior management and some staff would see pay cuts. But he added that there were no planned salary cuts for those making less than $125,000 a year, and no plans for layoffs of administrative staff members.

Education,Hiring a Coach in Pursuit of an Advanced Degree,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/01/education/more-adults-hire-consultants-in-quest-for-higher-education.html,"THE way back to school for many adults hoping to complete a bachelor's or master's degree is akin to being set loose in the wilderness without a compass. Adults have spent years juggling careers and life demands, and have ""no clearly articulated path to a degree,"" said Donald E. Fraser Jr., director of education and training at National Association for College Admission Counseling, whose members include independent consultants and school-based advisers. According to the National Center for Education Statistics, the 25-and-over student population grew 43 percent from 2000-9 and will increase an additional 23 percent by 2019. Mr. Fraser says he and other professional academic advisers are ""paying close attention"" to this market. Business for independent academic consultants has grown considerably as traditional students seek an edge in high-stakes undergraduate admissions. (Some 160,000 high school seniors used them in 2009, 100,000 more than in 2005, according to the Independent Educational Consultants Association.) Adults represent a small portion of that business, but as a sour economy makes even seasoned professionals consider further education, more working adults are seeking such advice on admissions and careers. For them, much is on the line -- jobs, finances, time, lifestyle sacrifices. ""If you're out in the work force and out of an academic mind-set for years,"" Mr. Fraser said, ""who are you going to turn to?""

For adults, a degree is a means rather than an end, says David Petersam, president of AdmissionsConsultants in Vienna, Va. Younger students, he says, typically go to college because they feel they must and often obtain first jobs that have nothing to do with their majors but allow them time to explore career direction. Adults going back to school have no such luxury. Many are like Sami Balbaky, who earned a master's in biomedical engineering from the University of Southern California in 2010. His approach to the application process was one-shot and full-throttle. At 29, he saw little room for error: He identified his top schools, did the legwork for his applications, collected transcripts, prepared for the Graduate Record Examination and wrote a personal essay. But he ""could not click the submit button"" on his applications, he says. Mr. Balbaky wanted his essay to be ""bulletproof and unassailable,"" so in 2008 he hired Write Track Admissions in Washington. He spent an entire summer working via computer from his home in San Francisco with an adviser, ""transforming my essay from a manifesto into a personal statement"" that helped win him admission to his top-choice school, he says. Those who hire consultants can work with them for a few weeks or many months, and pay anywhere from several hundred dollars to thousands of dollars (not tax deductible as an education expense) depending on the services and time needed. Pricing is by the hour or by the package. AdmissionsConsultants, for example, offers both options. Hourly rates range from $150 for applicants to medical school, to $250 for M.B.A. applicants. Fixed-fee packages are priced by the number of applications and the type of degree. A ""Gold Package"" of five applications for graduate programs, for example, costs $4,000.

For that investment, a client can expect an evaluation of prospective schools, guidance on admission strategies, help with an essay's theme and structure, interview preparation, G.R.E. advice and career information. With luck, a consultant becomes a sounding board who provides an insider's view on each school's admissions predilections and the marketplace forces that influence them. One wouldn't want to apply for a Harvard M.B.A. in finance, for example, at a time when university officials expect slack demand for the specialty. Clients concede that it is expensive. But it was worth it to Ramsey Day, who bought a single-school graduate package from AdmissionsConsultants.

In 2011, Mr. Day decided to apply for a graduate degree in public administration while winding down a job as head of the United States Agency for International Development's Montenegro office. At 36, out of school for 14 years, and living out of the country, Mr. Day said he ""had no idea what graduate schools were looking for."" He worked with an adviser online or by phone from Montenegro, and completed an application to American University's School of International Service. He figured he would replicate what he learned with four other applications completed on his own, including one to Harvard's Kennedy School of Government, where he was accepted and started a master's of public administration last fall. Cost of the one-year program: $50,000. The cost of the consulting services -- $1,500 -- was ""pennies compared to what I will get from this degree,"" he said. Whether to hire a private consultant depends not only on one's willingness or ability to pay, but on the type of program and school desired. Prospective students of schools with high admission rates, 25 to 30 percent, probably don't need them.

But Mr. Petersam and other advisers say they are beginning to serve a different adult clientele that, if not for the economic downturn, would not consider graduate school. They are needier and more confused, and seek guidance that is part career-counseling and part life-coaching. ""This person is coming to us and saying 'What do I do?' "" said Mr. Petersam, who has been advising adults since 1996. Mark Sklarow, executive director of Independent Educational Consultants Association, says this customer is of concern to him and his group's 1,000 members. ""With adults, sometimes there is almost a desperation to move forward with school because they see that as the answer,"" he said. ""My fear is that adults go to school without a game plan, they spend time and money, but they're not furthering their careers."" Consultants are adapting their services. At Write Track Admissions, a detailed questionnaire is administered upfront and is devised ""to get as personal as possible,"" said Hamada Zahawi, a co-founder of the company. ""Why have they made certain life decisions? What happened 10 or 15 years ago that impacted their goals? Do they have children to raise?"" Often the decision is not to go back to school. Such was the case with a client of Mr. Petersam's who had been running a construction business but was battered by the housing bust. ""He hated it and wanted to go back to school to do something else,"" he said. ""I said to him, 'You've got a lot invested here. Before you throw out the baby with the bath water, slow down. Do you hate everything?' """,Professionals 25 and older are seeking out independent education consultants to strengthen their applications for selective degree programs.,858c3812-d3f8-509b-bb93-c92b89b71f02,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/03/01/education/ADVISER/ADVISER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=50f7019e17fc872fdbcaf792353057a3d6a8ca19f8200f968d96e2e00c84d013&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"GETTING ADVICE David Petersam, left, president of AdmissionsConsultants, has been advising adults since 1996.",858c3812-d3f8-509b-bb93-c92b89b71f02,N24News/imgs/858c3812-d3f8-509b-bb93-c92b89b71f02.jpg,22
Well,Lidocaine Numbs the Pain of Infant Shots,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/15/well/family/lidocaine-numbs-the-pain-of-infant-shots.html,"A bit of sugar on the tongue may help distract a baby from the pain of an injection, and cuddling and cooing probably helps, too. But according to a new study, the most effective way to reduce the infant's pain is to apply lidocaine cream at the injection site as well.

Researchers randomized 352 babies under a year old to four regimens: a placebo (telling parents to do what they think best); an educational video about infant soothing; the video plus orally administered sucrose; and the video, sucrose and topically applied lidocaine to numb the pain. The study is in the Canadian Medical Journal.

Parents calculated the infants' pain on a zero-to-10 scale based on facial grimacing, crying and body movements.

With injections at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months and 1 year, the group that got the lidocaine swab consistently had lower pain scores. Scores in the groups that got sucrose and videos did not differ from those in the placebo group at any age.",A lidocaine swab can be an easy and effective way to ease the pain of childhood injections.,11bc0880-b1c8-5660-a063-68ce9b42ee9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/18/well/18well_pog_vaccs/well_pog_vaccs-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=402&w=768&s=2b0b007e43fc8753b76ce8aba73b68546d5fe3b238144320cbaf193afc7616a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,11bc0880-b1c8-5660-a063-68ce9b42ee9c,N24News/imgs/11bc0880-b1c8-5660-a063-68ce9b42ee9c.jpg,18
Theater,'Distances' Review: Fumblingly Picking at the Knot of Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/theater/distances-smaller-than-this-are-not-confirmed-review.html,"""When did you first realize that you were white?""

In ""Distances Smaller Than This Are Not Confirmed,"" David Neumann and Marcella Murray's quiet, experimental dialogue about race, the question comes up again and again -- she, a young black woman, posing it to him, a middle-aged white man who cannot answer it. Not that he doesn't try, grasping for childhood anecdotes like the time in second grade that he mispronounced Niger and spurred a classroom lecture on civil rights.

When did Murray first realize she was black? Neumann asks, and her answer is instantaneous, her calm certainty in perfect counterpoint to his squirming self-consciousness.

""I always know,"" she says. ""And of course I always knew.""

The difficulty that white people and people of color have in talking about race together is the knot that this Advanced Beginner Group production picks at, fumblingly -- a snarl as sensitive as nerve endings, and as American as our nation's history.

""You know how at the root of everything we don't say to each other is slavery?"" Murray asks.

Dance,Meet the Impresario Who Makes Dance Happen,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/arts/dance/meet-the-impresario-who-makes-dance-happen-sergei-danilian.html,"It started at the Russian Academy of Theater Arts in Moscow in 1982. Sergei Danilian wanted to impress a girl. ""She broke her high heel,"" Mr. Danilian, 57, said in a recent interview. ""She asked me to fix it. I was thinking, oh my God, she is such a cute girl from probably a rich family. How am I going to handle her? I picked up a job in the dorm in the night shift of security to earn the money to be able to handle Gaia."" Gaia, or Gaiane Danilian, now 52, eventually became his wife and business partner. Seated opposite him in their City Center office, where their arts management company, Ardani Artists, is headquartered, she muttered, ""Oh, please."" But money was scarce. He studied history; she focused on arts management. Suddenly, Mr. Danilian's course of education and his emerging career as a critic no longer seemed like a practical way to earn a decent living. What's more, he didn't want to write about art; he wanted to produce it.

Mr. Danilian does make art -- and especially dance -- happen. His latest theatrical concoction will be on display at City Center on Aug. 19 and 20 in the ""Ardani 25 Dance Gala,"" an anniversary program that showcases the work of new choreographers. His love of dance was born not from watching a specific performance, but from reading. He was also inspired by an exhibition he saw in Moscow in 1981, ""Paris-Moscow 1900-1930,"" which looked at, in part, Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Of Diaghilev, the great Russian impresario, Mr. Danilian said: ""I am jealous. You know why? He lived in the time of great artists working around him. That doesn't mean we don't have great artists now, but it was really different. There was magic around him."" But he, too, prides himself on being that old-fashioned thing: an impresario. In 1990, he formed Ardani Artists in Moscow; in collaboration with others, it brought American artists to Russia -- Merce Cunningham, the Limon Dance Company, Pilobolus and Dayton Contemporary Dance Company. Beginning in 1998, Mr. Danilian began to give many Russian artists, like the choreographer Boris Eifman and the ballerina Diana Vishneva, prominence in the United States in programs like ""Beauty in Motion,"" which focused on Ms. Vishneva. He also managed dancers, including Ms. Vishneva, Natalia Osipova and Polina Semionova. And he branched out with ""Kings of the Dance,"" a series showcasing male ballet stars of all nationalities. In his packaging of ballet, he found commercial success, attracting audiences in New York packed, it always seems, with Russians. Ms. Vishneva, in an email interview, stressed Mr. Danilian's importance as an impresario in Russia. ""He continues to work with our two leading academic theaters, the Mariinsky and the Bolshoi,"" she said. ""He discovers and supports young, talented dancers, and his talent-scouting scope is now expanding to young choreographers as well.""

""I wanted to show what's going on in Russia choreographically,"" he said of the gala program. ""And it's risky, but I decided if we're not going to show it now, God knows when it will be possible."" Mr. Danilian is nothing if not determined. He has long supported the work of Mr. Eifman, an expressive Russian choreographer who inspires strong feelings in audiences, love or hate and little in between. While Mr. Danilian's taste can be questionable -- recent iterations of ""Kings,"" which felt cheaply commercial, as well as many appearances by Mr. Eifman -- he is driven by a love of dance. The producer David Eden became acquainted with Mr. Danilian in 1989; at the time, Mr. Eden, who had left the Soviet Union as a child, hoped to reconnect with his culture. ""I wanted to develop projects, and I was meeting people, but it just felt somewhat mercenary, and then I met Sergei,"" Mr. Eden said. ""I sensed that adventurous spirit, which in some ways identifies us here.""

Mr. Danilian is Armenian but was born in Sumgait, Azerbaijan, then a part of the Soviet Union. In high school, he appeared in a play and ""first smelled the theater,"" but when he told his teacher he was going to pursue acting in Moscow, she told him that he was crazy. His parents didn't stop him. There were some detours, including the mandatory two-year service in the Soviet army, during which he used his time wisely. While based in a suburb of St. Petersburg, Mr. Danilan immersed himself in art. When he finally made it to the Russian Academy of Theater Arts, he had given up on acting and was pursuing history and criticism and later, arts management. He eventually led a department of the theater union of the Soviet Union, where he was in charge of its dance and theater tours. He traveled constantly, meeting and working with directors and choreographers, including Peter Brook, Patrice Chereau, Ariane Mnouchkine and Pina Bausch. He also formed a bond with the Bolshoi dancer Ilze Liepa, whom he considers ""a godmother who brought us to the ballet world."" While Ms. Danilian moved to the United States in 1992 with the couple's two young sons (they are now 29 and 30), Mr. Danilian commuted back and forth until 1998, when he closed his Moscow office. It wasn't an easy time; for one thing, Mr. Danilian barely spoke English; he learned by studying movies. ""I remember my first car accident in New York when I couldn't explain to the policeman what happened,"" he said. ""After that, I started watching films with situations that could help me learn. Action films. Films with car accidents. 'Police Academy.'"" In 1994, Mr. Danilian lost a substantial amount of money on two performances, including a version of Glinka's ""Ruslan and Lyudmila"" at Avery Fisher Hall by the Moscow New Opera Theater. ""Who knows a new opera from Moscow?"" he asked. ""Nobody. I started looking for some jobs.""","Sergei Danilian and his wife, Gaia, run the arts management company Ardani Artists, which specializes in dance.",6ffbb156-b611-5a68-a812-9bad8fac6bd0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/14/arts/14DANILIAN1/14DANILIAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=6129ca903b54b2bfa54c4f7b8f559ae2b6ab4a1122f7bf8b8814a608d787c7f7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sergei and Gaia Danilian at their office at City Center.,6ffbb156-b611-5a68-a812-9bad8fac6bd0,N24News/imgs/6ffbb156-b611-5a68-a812-9bad8fac6bd0.jpg,6

So what is this award? And why is it so important?



The Pritzker Prize is frequently called the Nobel of architecture.

This annual international award recognizes a living architect or architects whose work ""has produced consistent and significant contributions to humanity through the art of architecture."" The prominent Pritzker family of Chicago established the award through the Hyatt Foundation in 1979, when the American architect Philip Johnson became the first winner, for a body of work that includes the Glass House in New Canaan, Conn. The prize consists of $100,000 and a bronze medallion.

Many in the field see the Pritzker not only as a validation of an individual's work but also as a validation of the profession.

Technology,Uber Report: Eric Holder's Recommendations for Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/technology/uber-report-eric-holders-recommendations-for-change.html,"Here are the main recommendations for improving Uber's workplace culture as laid out in a report after an inquiry by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general, and his law firm, Covington & Burling.

The report urged that the responsibilities of Uber's chief executive, Travis Kalanick, be reallocated:

The Board should evaluate the extent to which some of the responsibilities that Mr. Kalanick has historically possessed should be shared or given outright to other members of senior management. The search for a Chief Operating Officer should address this concern to some extent.

Mr. Kalanick, who announced a leave of absence as the report was disclosed, has been under fire for his flouting of rules and norms, including transportation and safety regulations.

The report called for the company to use performance reviews to hold executives accountable and to increase the powers of the company's head of diversity:

The position should be renamed the ""Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer,"" and the position should report directly to the CEO or the COO. This action is intended to reflect the elevated status of this role and demonstrate the company's commitment to this issue.

Recommendations included the addition of more independent board members, an independent chair of the board, an oversight committee, and using compensation to hold senior executives accountable:

The report called for Uber, which has been heavily criticized for a management culture that is slow to respond to employee complaints, to make sure it had good tools in place to track employee data, including complaints:

Recommendations also included mandatory leadership training for executives, human resources training and manager training.","Here are the main recommendations for improving Uber's workplace culture as laid out in a report by the former attorney general and his law firm, Covington & Burling.",38ebd22f-5a7d-53af-835d-7e2ab4621ca3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/business/14UBER1/14UBER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=edbb983146c1421a861a4d99ebb10a789c856c8023473323a04ed45ffe8aea49&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Uber's reputation has suffered in recent months because of issues over its workplace culture.,38ebd22f-5a7d-53af-835d-7e2ab4621ca3,N24News/imgs/38ebd22f-5a7d-53af-835d-7e2ab4621ca3.jpg,20
Automobiles,"Muscles on Its Muscles, but Nuance in Its Soul",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/27/automobiles/autoreviews/muscles-on-its-muscles-but-nuance-in-its-soul.html,"WHEN I first heard rumors that Chevrolet was going to produce the 2012 Camaro ZL1, I thought, ""Fine, G.M. is building a Camaro with a supercharger and more horsepower. Big deal."" Now I've driven it and I know better: defining the ZL1 solely by its extra power is similar to saying that Dennis Rodman is famous just for his rebounding ability. There's quite a bit more to the story. Adding a supercharger is only the first step in making a ZL1 out of a workaday Camaro SS. If you want to do it Chevy's way -- that is, create a car that will stand up to the output of a deep-breathing V-8 -- you'll need to install a new clutch and flywheel, along with improved synchronizers for better shifting of the 6-speed manual transmission. Then upgrade the differential and axle shafts. And brakes and antiroll bars. Next, throw in a performance traction control system and Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers -- and tweak the bodywork in a wind tunnel so it generates downforce at higher speeds.

Voila! That's most of it. In short, wringing 580 horsepower from a 6.2-liter V-8 is relatively easy. Creating a Camaro that laps Germany's Nurburgring in a Porsche-hounding seven minutes and 41 seconds is not. While the ZL1's styling is as subtle as an anvil falling from the sky, its performance is defined by Chevy's attention to nuance. That might sound counterintuitive, given that we're talking about a monster Camaro whose LSA V-8 (a close cousin of the 638-horsepower LS9 in the Corvette ZR1) pushes it to 0-to-60 times in about four seconds flat. But a day of driving during the press introduction at Virginia International Raceway here -- a fast, challenging road course near the North Carolina border -- revealed a Camaro that evokes blue-ribbon sport coupes like the BMW M3. Except that the ZL1 surely gets around V.I.R. much quicker. The handling of the current-generation Camaro SS has always been characterized by understeer, the tendency for the front tires to lose grip before the rears, causing the front end to push wide in hard cornering. Understeer makes a chassis benign and predictable, but it's not exactly fun. ""Understeer is irrelevant for 99 percent of drivers, because they'll never push hard enough for it to be a problem,"" said Tony Roma, engineering manager of the ZL1 program. ""But for the other 1 percent, it was a big issue.""

So the ZL1 got a different layout for its antiroll bars, which gives the car lively, neutral handling, and in similar form trickles down to 2012 SS models. Call it voodoo chassis-nomics. At the racetrack, Chevy had a car propped up to show off the cleverness underneath. There was a lot to take in, but I was immediately intrigued by what looked like miniature shock absorbers on the suspension control arms. These turned out to be wheel-position sensors, part of the ZL1's Performance Traction Management system. Conventional traction control systems detect a loss of grip and then reduce the engine's torque or tap the brakes. The ZL1 aims for a predictive approach. If, say, you're going full-throttle through a corner and the front tires hit a bump, the system will start cutting torque before the rear wheels arrive at the bump, saving you from a lurching half-slide followed by a scolding computer intervention.

The suspension is a partner in this exercise, processing input from the sensors 1,000 times a second (which means that at 60 m.p.h., the ZL1 ""reads"" each inch of road). The Magnetic Ride Control shock absorbers make the most of this information, instantly adapting their responses to the circumstances. I put all of that wizardry to the test on the track, a great place to remind yourself how little you know about driving. I rode with Mr. Roma to reacquaint myself with the course; on the first lap the driver behind us went into a corner too hot and skidded into the grass. They weren't joking about spicing up the Camaro's handling. For my turn at the wheel, I set the traction management system to mode three, which firms up the suspension and dials back the traction-control intervention but retains the safety net of the stability control electronics. The next two settings progressively banish the electronic nannies, culminating in mode five, in which the electronic handling aids are shut off. In theory, this is much like Ferrari's F1 Trac system, which lets the driver decide the extent of the car's computer-aided heroics.

On the track, Performance Traction Management functions like Ferrari's system, letting the driver use full throttle when exiting corners while the computer precisely metes out torque. The Ferrari system is no doubt slicker, but hey, I just compared Camaros to Ferraris. Raining frogs are imminent. This Camaro is one of the rare road cars that generates aerodynamic downforce. At 150 m.p.h., the ZL1's vented hood, flat underbody and rear spoiler help it to produce 65 pounds of downforce. It doesn't sound like much, but at the same speed a Camaro SS is contending with 200 pounds of aerodynamic lift. Trust me, rocketing through the Climbing Esses section at V.I.R. you'll appreciate the difference. I'm sure some buyers will confine their track time to dragstrips, where the original ZL1, a limited-production -- and barely domesticated -- 1969 model earned its reputation. G.M. says that the 2012 version's 556 pound feet of torque will help it to pound out quarter-mile elapsed times in the high 11-second neighborhood on the factory tires. But this car is really built for road courses, and it would be a shame to condemn it to a life of quarter-mile runs. For a big car, the ZL1 dances. You can wrestle a 426-horsepower Camaro SS around a track at respectable speed, but the ZL1 behaves as if it were born to be there. Instead of plowing through corners, the rear end is willing to step out and point the front end into the turn. I've driven an M3 on this track, and the ZL1 really feels like a big BMW M car. Call it the M6's American pen pal. The uberCamaro also costs nearly as much as an M3, which brings me to my caveats. Is $54,995 too much for a Camaro? (Don't forget to add the $1,300 guzzler tax for the manual transmission model or $2,600 for the automatic.) That's a question only you and your wallet can answer. But I will say that for your money, nothing else with a back seat can approach the ZL1's thundering performance. The other smirch on the ZL1's report card is its weight: 4,120 pounds with the manual transmission, some 241 pounds more than a Camaro SS. The ZL1 weighs so much because it's built to survive the severe abuse that will inevitably be heaped upon it. The huge differential, for instance, has a cast-iron housing and its own cooler. The optional 6-speed 6L90 automatic transmission is the same one used on G.M.'s heavy-duty pickups. The brakes are enormous -- 14.6-inch front rotors with six-piston calipers, 14.4-inch rear rotors with four-piston calipers.","While the ZL1's styling isn't subtle, its performance is defined by Chevy's attention to nuance.

Art & Design,Buffy the Vampire Slayer Returns to High School in New Comic Books,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/arts/design/buffy-the-vampire-slayer-new-comic-book.html,"Jeanine Schaefer edits the new series. She recruited Bellaire for the book thanks in part to her work on Redlands, about a coven of witches in a small Florida town. ""It felt like the exact right mix of talking about identity issues, gender issues and still having that thread of horror and so moments of levity,"" Schaefer said during a conference call with Bellaire.

Terror and humor resonate for many as an apt description of high school, including for Bellaire. ""Me and Jeanine talked about how teenagers now are growing up a bit different than they did in the '90s,"" she said. ""It is a trying time for teenagers. I think people are feeling a lot of pressure and negativity.""

Previous adventures will not be rehashed in the reboot, which will tell all new stories. The setting allows some of the characters to begin at a new point. While Willow, for example, eventually came out as a lesbian on the TV series, she is already open about her orientation in Issue No. 1 of the new comic. ""The '90s was a different time on TV and for the L.G.B.T. community,"" Bellaire said. ""I'd like to think it is a little more open now,"" allowing Willow to be much more confident.",Boom!

Science,Distant Ringed Object Could Be 'Saturn on Steroids',https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/science/exoplanet-rings-saturn-j1407b.html,"About 400 light years from our solar system, there is a celestial body that looks like Saturn on steroids.

Its rings are about 200 times larger than its counterpart here, measuring about 75 million miles in diameter. The ring system is so large, in fact, that scientists aren't sure why it doesn't get ripped apart by the gravity of the star it orbits.

One reason the rings might stay intact has to do with the direction in which they spin around the object at their center, called J1407b. Scientists are not sure whether J1407b is a gigantic planet that measures many times larger than Saturn, or a failed star called a brown dwarf.

There is a point in J1407b's lopsided orbit when it comes close to its sunlike star, which should disrupt the rings. But the rings remain unscathed for the most part because they spin around J1407b in the opposite direction that the object orbits around its star, according to a paper accepted in the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics and posted online on Tuesday.",A potential planet detected by astronomers probably has rings that spin in the opposite direction of the object's spin around its sun.,bd8a4b2d-bde3-5ca8-9c60-12f610185bc7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/14/science/14TB-rings/14TB-rings-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=73af5ebaa9acd7f89f64c452dca98142ecb4a7b054be2d86933eb12547459277&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An artist's rendition of the gigantic ring system circling what scientists think may be a giant planet or brown dwarf called J1407b.,bd8a4b2d-bde3-5ca8-9c60-12f610185bc7,N24News/imgs/bd8a4b2d-bde3-5ca8-9c60-12f610185bc7.jpg,2
Opinion,"America, We Break It, It's Gone",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/opinion/trump-george-floyd-america.html,"On Nov. 9, 2016, the morning after our last presidential election, my column began by recalling words from an immigrant, my friend Lesley Goldwasser, who came to America from Zimbabwe in the 1980s. Surveying our political scene a few years earlier, Lesley had remarked to me: ""You Americans kick around your country like it's a football. But it's not a football. It's a Faberge egg. You can break it."" I then added: ""With Donald Trump now elected president, I have more fear than I've ever had in my 63 years that we could do just that -- break our country, that we could become so irreparably divided that our national government will not function."" Well, I am now 66, and my fears have all come true -- and worse. I am not at all certain we will be able to conduct a free and fair election in November or have a peaceful transition of presidential power in January. We are edging toward a cultural civil war, only this time we are not lucky: Abraham Lincoln is not the president. Lincoln, in our darkest, most divisive hour, was able to dig deep into his soul and find the words ""with malice toward none, with charity for all ... let us strive on to finish the work we are in"" and establish ""a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations."" Instead, we have Donald Trump, a man whose first instinct, when the country is being ripped apart, was to have peaceful protesters tear-gassed and shoved aside so that he could walk to a nearby church just for a photo op outside holding a Bible. He did not open that Bible to read a healing passage. He did not enter the church to host a healing dialogue. He posed for a photo op to drive up his support among white evangelicals. Trump was holding the Bible upside down.

What to do? Where can we find the leadership needed to calm this situation, deal with its underlying causes and at least get us through the 2020 election? Three years ago, I might have hoped that Senate Republicans would step in and restrain Trump. But now we all know better. The Senate Republican caucus today is nothing but a political brothel. Mitch McConnell is the madame. And McConnell and his caucus rent themselves out by the night to whoever will energize the Republican base to keep them in power and secure the economic benefits for their wealthiest donors. Those energizers have been Sarah Palin, the Tea Party, coal companies, industrial polluters and now Trump's most rabid supporters. It doesn't matter who. The red light is always on above the door of the Senate G.O.P. caucus room. How about the social media barons? Will they save us from the toxic waste they now circulate? Certainly not Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, who is clearly the Rupert Murdoch of his generation. He's always justifying his cowardly choices with vacuous bromides about ""free speech,"" but he's obviously just in it for the money -- no matter how much his platform is used to destroy our democracy. It is interesting to note that scientists tell us that people with the coronavirus who are loud and obnoxious in a closed room are the biggest super-spreaders of that pathogen. And internet experts tell us that people who are loud and obnoxious online are the biggest super-spreaders of political pathogens. That's because Facebook's whole business model is to encourage and reward enragement because it drives more engagement. Sorry, help is not on the way from Zuck.

So where to look? It is not hopeless. I hope America's principled business leaders, and there are many, can find a way to come together to lead a healing discussion, maybe through the Business Roundtable, in the absence of a president willing and able to do so. AT&T Chairman Randall Stephenson eloquently called for exactly this on CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday morning. (AT&T is a donor to Planet Word, a museum to promote reading and literacy that my wife is building in Washington, D.C.) ""All of us C.E.O.s have large African-American employee bodies,"" he said. ""We owe it to them to make sure we're speaking to this and that we're asking our policymakers to step up ... and just say it: 'We got a problem. We have a big problem. And it needs to be dealt with.'"" Stephenson added: ""This is about doing justice and making sure that we're putting in place procedures ... to address what seem to be constant and recurring injustices ... as it relates to interaction of law enforcement"" with the black community. How can business make an immediate difference? Obviously by empowering politicians who want to address police reforms, but, just as important, by amplifying local social entrepreneurs working in disadvantaged neighborhoods to help their residents realize their full potential. I am from Minneapolis. I was born in the Northside, a few miles from the street where George Floyd was killed. No one there is doing more today to make sure that disadvantaged families in that neighborhood have the tools to succeed than my friend Sondra Samuels, the C.E.O. and president of the Northside Achievement Zone. NAZ is working with parents, students and local partners to drive a culture shift in predominantly black North Minneapolis to end multigenerational poverty through education and building family stability. Sondra told me the right response to the killing of Floyd has to be ""both/and"" not ""either/or."" We need both an immediate end to the looting, burning and infiltration of white supremacist groups that is destroying the homes and businesses of good people in cities all over the country and we need deeper civil rights, voting rights, education, environmental and policing reforms for this generation.

NAZ and its 30 nonprofit partners and schools will tell you that it is a struggle, often two steps forward and one step back, but they have been making a quantifiable difference in getting kids the tools to succeed and get to college, and at the same time providing parents the support they need to stabilize their homes, increase their parenting skills and ensure upward mobility. NAZ has also significantly increased access to quality early-learning opportunities for the 1,000 families it works with and helped provide measurable improvements in reading proficiency and other learning metrics critical for life success. If you are depressed and want to do something that will have a lasting impact for the common good -- not just denounce looters and scream at Trump on your television screen -- check out the NAZ website and hit the donate button! Finally, I think remarkable leadership is coming from some local politicians -- so many great mayors of all colors and political stripes. Every time I hear Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms speak -- whether about dealing with the coronavirus, injustice or the rioting in her town -- I want to ask Joe Biden: ""Are you interviewing her for vice president?""

And I was really impressed how, to help quell the violence in Atlanta, she enlisted the local rapper Killer Mike at her press conference, who told the city: ""It is your duty not to burn your own house down for anger with an enemy. It is your duty to fortify your own house so that you may be a house of refuge in times of organization. Now is the time to plot, plan, strategize, organize and mobilize. It is time to beat up prosecutors you don't like at the voting booth. It is time to hold mayoral offices accountable, chiefs and deputy chiefs. I'd like to appreciate our mayor for talking to us like a black mama and telling us to take our ass home, and I'd like to thank my friends for convincing me to come here."" Help is not on the way from this White House or this G.O.P., but the country is full of problem-solvers. We need to ignore Trump as much as possible; he's made himself part of the problem. But we can connect, elevate, amplify and empower the business leaders, social entrepreneurs and local leaders who are rising and ready to be the solution.

Fashion & Style,How often should you really wash your hair?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/24/fashion/how-often-should-you-really-wash-your-hair.html,"How often should you really wash your hair?

This article is part of a series aimed at helping you navigate life's opportunities and challenges. What else should we write about? Contact us: smarterliving@nytimes.com. We are well trained to lather, rinse and repeat. But chances are you're washing your hair far too often. Instead of the traditional shampoo-and-conditioner routine, many experts say we should be co-washing more -- short for conditioner-only washing -- embracing a little grease and letting our hair's natural oils do their job. ""Your hair needs to produce natural oils,"" said Juliette Dallas-Feeney, senior social media manager and beauty influencer at Birchbox, the online beauty subscription service. ""If you wash it too much, you can strip your hair of them. And if you don't wash your hair enough, it can do the same thing because of product buildup. Your scalp can get yucky and gross.""

Ms. Dallas-Feeney, who has short blond hair, has gone 10 days without washing her hair, albeit with some help from dry shampoo. She typically uses shampoo once to twice a week. ""I do a deep clean when I do wash my hair and really massage it into my scalp, and I'm careful not to get the shampoo on my ends,"" she said. ""Then I rinse it out and apply conditioner from my roots to my tips. When I'm shampooing, I'm just focused on scalp cleaning."" Not everyone can cut back so thoroughly. Training your hair to need less frequent washing depends on the texture of your hair. For women with thinner hair or those who work out regularly, Ms. Dallas-Feeney said, ""dry shampoo is your best friend."" ""It's a process of transition,"" she said and recommended taking it one day at a time. ""It's going to feel weird at first."" We consulted some hair pros for further hair-washing intel. Jeff Chastain, a hairstylist in New York City, recommends that women get their shampooing down to once or twice a week. Less washing, he said, means stronger and longer hair.

And women with curls need not wash their hair as often as others. ""I tell people with curly hair to use conditioner only, give it a good scrub on the head and then pull the conditioner through to the ends and rinse it out,"" Mr. Chastain said. Straight hair tends to get greasier more quickly because the oils can travel more quickly down the hair, Mr. Chastain said. If you can stand it, he said, try wetting your hair only every other day and use a dry shampoo. On Day 2 or 3 of no washing, Mr. Chastain suggests pulling your hair back into a ponytail or other updo. ""Use hair spray to work with the shine you're getting from the grease,"" he said. ""Work with it, not against it. Sleek it back using just a little bit of serum or hair spray and rock an updo for a day or two."" Mr. Chastain tells men to use shampoo only once a week and to scrub their hair with conditioner on the other days. The conditioner has mild cleansing properties that help remove buildup with minimal damage to hair, he said.

""Guys want touchable hair,"" he said. ""They don't want it to look like there's anything in there."" The shampoo-conditioner regimen he suggests won't take out the oil, so the hair isn't puffy and unmanageable. Shampooing without conditioner isn't ideal, he said, because it leaves the hair ""really dry and really big."" Nikki Walton, founder of curlynikki.com, a natural-hair blog for black women and author of ""Better Than Good Hair: The Curly Girl Guide to Healthy, Gorgeous Natural Hair!"" (Amistad), has highly textured hair with corkscrew curls throughout. She washes her hair every two weeks with conditioner and once a month with a clarifying shampoo. ""Your hair is like a fine sweater,"" she said. ""The more you wash it, the more it wears and tears. Your individual hair strands swell and contract, so you're damaging your hair every time you wet it. You can't avoid that."" Women with looser curls can wash their hair a couple of times a week with just a conditioner or milder shampoo, Ms. Walton said. Women with textured hair, including black women and curly girls, will opt to just co-wash several times a week and shampoo once every few weeks or once a month, she said. ""Many curly girls stay clear of shampoo as much as possible because dry equals more frizz."" Ms. Walton recommends using a color applicator bottle and diluting shampoo with warm water. That way it can be directly applied to the scalp. Massage with your finger pads because, she said, ""you don't want to scratch it.""

It's perhaps counterintuitive that Michael Gordon, the founder and former president of Bumble and bumble, would call himself Mr. Anti-Shampoo. But Mr. Gordon now leads the creative studio Hairstory, where he introduced a line of detergent-free hair products that allow for less washing. ""It used to be that Americans, among other people, washed their hair a lot,"" he said. But overwashing can backfire. ""If you wash your hair with detergent, it encourages your hair to get greasy, and then you have to wash it again,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""If you don't bombard it with detergent in the first place, you're fine. After three weeks or so of not washing your hair every three or four days, you won't have to wash so often."" The history of hair-washing, he said, has taken many twists and turns. A hundred years ago, washing was typically a weekly experience. By the 1960s, Mr. Gordon noted, many women didn't do their hair themselves but had it ""done"" and preserved. Only in recent years was washing every day thought to be the thing to do. ""I certainly did it for a long time,"" he said. ""Things change."" And younger people are turning on to the anti-shampoo movement. ""The less they have to do, the better they like it, and I think they get the sustainability aspect of that,"" Mr. Gordon said. ""If we don't have to wash our hair every day, then we're wasting less water.""",It depends — but it's probably less often than you're washing it now.,562bc1fe-7a47-540e-9d3b-f82308891bac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/03/fashion/03HAIRWASH/03HAIRWASH-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=e87c0d8dc783c9d3ec648bec3f9060c3a22e8bb76e6b07c4dfa20ac8106bca60&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,How often should you wash your hair?,562bc1fe-7a47-540e-9d3b-f82308891bac,N24News/imgs/562bc1fe-7a47-540e-9d3b-f82308891bac.jpg,19
Real Estate,From Upstate to the West Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/26/realestate/from-upstate-to-the-west-village.html,"The Buyers Fred and Phyllis Erikson and their cat, S'mores, now have a cozy perch in the city.

Back when Phyllis Erikson, formerly Phyllis Ricciardi, was growing up on Staten Island, ""there was nothing there except houses,"" she said, ""so we came into the city a lot."" She remembers cutting class at Curtis High School for an adventure in Greenwich Village. Fred Erikson also grew up on Staten Island, but he attended Stuyvesant High School, then near Stuyvesant Square; he commuted by ferry. Introduced by friends, the couple moved to the Albany area in 1968. They lived on 100 acres in a 12-room center-hall colonial, fully renovated over the years primarily by Mr. Erikson, a former English teacher, now 78. They had five children.

Ms. Erikson, 72, a retired lawyer, always loved city life. A few years ago, their financial adviser agreed it was a good time to buy a pied-a-terre in the city. But the bed-bug scare then in the news put them off. West Village

A studio in a 1960 building on Horatio Street was great, but not so the gas station diagonally across the street. Last summer, though, their interest rekindled, the Eriksons began the hunt. They stopped by the office of Fenwick Keats Real Estate in Greenwich Village, where they met Will Rogers, who became their agent. They told Mr. Rogers they could afford to spend $600,000 for a co-op, envisioning a lovely tree-lined street in the West Village. Beyond that, they weren't fussy. ""We don't need anything -- just a little place to hang our hats,"" Ms. Erikson said. Mr. Rogers suggested a studio in a 1960 building on Horatio Street at Eighth Avenue. The apartment, with bright southern views, was listed at $575,000; maintenance was almost $500 a month. The Eriksons liked the place but not the busy corner, with a gas station diagonally across the street -- ""not a little gas station but a truck-stop plaza,"" Ms. Erikson said. That apartment later sold for $545,000.

Away on vacation, Mr. Rogers e-mailed the couple a list of possibilities, with instructions to winnow them down. ""While Will was gone,"" Ms. Erikson said, ""we went and visited on the outside of every single one of them, and I took pictures and made notes."" Chelsea

An otherwise nice place in Chelsea Gardens on West 23rd lacked a view. And its Art Deco-style complex was too big. Traipsing around, they learned they wanted to be close to several subway lines. ""Although we love to walk,"" she said, ""we realized the spirit may be willing but the back is starting to give out."" By the time Mr. Rogers returned, some they liked were already in contract. It was at this point that their financial adviser suggested they increase their budget to $700,000. Mr. Rogers concurred. ""You don't get a whole lot for your money in the West Village,"" he said. In Chelsea they could get an actual one-bedroom. On West 23rd Street at Chelsea Gardens, a circa-1940 co-op, a nice one-bedroom with monthly maintenance of $1,200 was listed at $750,000. But it looked out on brick walls. The complex, with more than 250 units, also seemed too big. ""We were not crazy about the rabbit-warren kind of thing,"" Ms. Erikson said. That one later sold for $720,000. Another one-bedroom, with plenty of sunlight, was for sale in a 1961 building on Bleecker and Mercer Streets in Greenwich Village. It was $680,000, and maintenance was around $1,000 a month. But the Eriksons were concerned about the planned New York University construction nearby.

The Village

A routine layout worked against a sunny one-bedroom on Bleecker. And it was close to planned N.Y.U. expansion. Besides, such postwar apartments all looked alike, Mr. Erikson said. ""You know what you are going to get as soon as you walk in. Some are long and narrow, and some are square. There was nothing to get excited about."" No location could compare with that of a building on Christopher Street at the corner of narrow, crooked and quintessentially charming Gay Street. At seven stories, it was the tallest building around. On their list, ""I put stars next to this one,"" Ms. Erikson said. ""It almost didn't matter what it was like inside,"" which was good, because it was a mess. When they entered, they found an alcove studio, with ""the kitchen cabinets piled up in the middle of the floor and the pipes sticking out of the wall,"" Mr. Erikson said. ""I fell in love with this place, I hate to admit it, because it has some soul."" The price for the unit, which was in mid-renovation, was $710,000, maintenance about $900 a month. The seller, however, also owned the smaller studio next door, and wanted to sell the apartments together. The second, rectangular in shape, was $650,000, with monthly maintenance of $725. Another party wanted both. Ms. Erikson was disappointed. ""She said, 'I am taking this much harder than I thought,' "" Mr. Rogers said.",Phyllis and Fred Erikson missed the city adventures of their youth.

Food,"On Capitol Hill, the Caucus Grows for Diwali",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/22/dining/diwali-congress.html,"President Trump has celebrated Diwali in the White House since taking office in 2017.





WASHINGTON -- For Representative Pramila Jayapal, there was no better party during her childhood in Jakarta, Indonesia, than the one that took place on Diwali, the Indian festival of lights. Jakarta didn't have a large Indian population in the 1970s and '80s, so the 100 or so people who lived in her area would meet for an epic feast at one of their houses. The place would be decked out with dozens of diyas, or decorative oil lamps, and statues of Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth. ""It was the most extravagant of celebrations,"" said Ms. Jayapal, 54, with seemingly bottomless varieties of Indian dishes: spiced fritters called pakoras; fluffy idlis, a type of rice cake; and dosas stuffed with potatoes and served with a vibrant coconut chutney. An entire section of the table was devoted to desserts like ghee-soaked laddoos and payasam, rice pudding studded with raisins and cashews that her mother would make special for the holiday (which this year will be celebrated on Sunday).

""They don't replicate the kind of joy and fun and meaning those early celebrations had,"" she said, referring to Diwalis of her childhood. Today there are four more House members who celebrate Diwali: Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, Raja Krishnamoorthi of Illinois, and Ami Bera and Ro Khanna of California. All are Democrats, one is a presidential candidate and all but one are of Indian heritage; Ms. Gabbard adopted Hinduism as a teenager. Senator Kamala Harris of California, another Democrat of Indian descent and a presidential candidate, does not personally observe Diwali, but she has participated in Diwali celebrations in the past. As this representation has grown, so has the awareness of the holiday -- and of Indian cuisine and culture -- within the echelons of government.

There's some progress to be made: Just four years ago, when Ms. Jayapal was a state senator, she celebrated India's Independence Day by bringing in samosas for the Republican and Democratic caucuses. She recalled that one member ""came up to me and said, 'Those things were delicious, but I thought you were bringing mimosas.'"" Diwali, which honors the triumph of good over evil, is not the only significant Indian holiday. But it does have the most name recognition in America. And even though it is technically a Hindu festival, it has become more of a cultural event. ""It's a symbolic holiday that unites us as a diaspora,"" said Mr. Krishnamoorthi, and that invites others to share and celebrate, often over food.

Barack Obama was the first president to celebrate Diwali in the White House, in 2009. (There were White House observances under President George W. Bush, but he didn't attend.) The United States Postal Service introduced a Diwali stamp in 2016, in response to a congressional resolution introduced by Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York. President Trump has observed the holiday in the White House each year since taking office, though last year he left out Hindus in two tweets describing who observes Diwali. Because Diwali is not a federal holiday in the United States, it's sometimes hard for these members of Congress to take time off for celebrations. Mr. Bera, Ms. Jayapal, Mr. Khanna and Mr. Krishnamoorthi said they try to attend the small affair on the Hill, though Mr. Khanna could barely remember what happens during that event, as ""there are so many receptions,"" he said, and ""nothing in Congress has that kind of color and life to it."" In her home city, Seattle, Ms. Jayapal and her husband, Steve Williamson, typically go to a friend's place for a Diwali potluck, sometimes with their child, Janak Preston, 22.

Travel,On the Bauhaus Trail in Germany,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/travel/bauhaus-germany-art-design.html,"The Bauhaus Building rises over Dessau, a small, postindustrial city in eastern Germany, like a futuristic message from the past. With its suspended glass facades, exposed steel gridding and asymmetrical layout, the three-wing complex feels both modern and familiar. But when it was finished in 1926, it was downright alien. Like a transparent cube levitating over the town, the building was the crystalline culmination of Bauhaus's global vision, one so wildly influential that it's difficult today to find some corner of design, architecture or the arts that doesn't bear its traces. The tubular chair, the glass-and-steel office tower, the clean uniformity of contemporary graphic design -- so much of what we associate with the word ""modernism"" -- has roots in a small German art school that existed for only 14 years. Founded in 1919 in Weimar by the up-and-coming German architect Walter Gropius, the Staatliches Bauhaus combined the fine arts, crafts and design under one roof with the aim of creating a Gesamtkunstwerk, or total work of art. It existed in three German cities -- Weimar, Dessau and Berlin -- and under three architect-directors: Gropius, Hannes Meyer and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. Its development paralleled that of the Weimar Republic, rising from the rubble of the First World War, flourishing in the political, economic and cultural chaos of the interwar years, and ending in 1933 with the rise of the Third Reich. Bauhaus teachers included some of the most important artists of the modern era -- Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Josef Albers and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, to name a few -- many of whom fled Germany after the school's closure under pressure from the Nazis, leading them to pollinate Bauhaus ideas throughout the world, primarily in the United States.

The centenary comes at a time when Bauhaus is experiencing a renaissance. Interest among artists is ""certainly growing,"" said Annemarie Jaeggi, the director of the Bauhaus-Archiv in Berlin, a museum and research center. ""I'm astonished how many artists today -- and especially young artists -- are getting back to crafts and are hooking in Bauhaus ideas,"" she said. The number of visitors to major Bauhaus institutions has been climbing, yet most of them, Ms. Jaeggi said, come from outside Germany. Indeed, on my trip, I encountered a historical oddity: Despite its global import, Bauhaus is not widely revered in its country of origin. This has something to do with the conflation here of Bauhaus and modernism, as well as with the fact that Bauhaus is also the name of Germany's largest home improvement chain. But there's a bigger reason, which can be glimpsed through the window of a Deutsche Bahn train hurtling through the outskirts of nearly any German city. The proliferation of cheap, boxlike concrete-slab high-rises that spread like bacteria throughout Germany's bombed-out cities after World War II is a Bauhaus legacy, for better or worse.

""For many people,"" said Dr. Jaeggi, ""Bauhaus has more of a negative aspect than a positive one."" Yet a closer look at Bauhaus and the German modernist architectural movement known as Neues Bauen, or New Objectivity, makes clear how little these movements had to do with the prefab obscenities of postwar modernism. Today, many Bauhaus devotees hope the centenary program will sow domestic interest and pride in the movement at a time when Germany is bitterly divided over its reception of refugees and reckoning with its cultural identity. Though small, Weimar, a leafy, picture-book tourist town about 50 miles southwest of Leipzig, has an outsized cultural significance in the country. Yet as pretty as the hometown of Goethe and Schiller is, there's something stifling about Weimar's cobblestone Old Town, with its faux-medieval terrace restaurants full of retirees contentedly eating fruitcake. Only recently has Bauhaus joined in earnest Weimar's pantheon of cultural accolades. It was here that Gropius, a handsome 36-year-old architect decorated for valor in World War I, was asked to head a new school formed from the merger of the Weimar state schools of applied and fine arts. When he opened the Bauhaus in 1919, he recruited master teachers and called for artists and craftsmen to create the ""building of the future."" A portrait of Walter Gropius in front of a development plan, 1930. Occupying a suite of Art Nouveau school buildings, the early Bauhaus was ""more than a school,"" as Tom Wolfe wrote in his 1981 book ""From Bauhaus to Our House."" ""It was a commune, a spiritual movement, a radical approach to art in all its forms, a philosophical center comparable to the Garden of Epicurus."" With their long hair and androgynous clothing, Bauhaus students lived together, worked together and held wild, legendary parties, built around themes (Lantern Festival, Kite Festival) that in later years became increasingly high-concept (Metal Festival, Beard, Nose and Heart Party). Life at the Bauhaus was in many ways a precursor to the bohemianism that took hold in America's liberal arts colleges half a century later. The student body was international and diverse, with women making up about half. Though this was outwardly encouraged, Gropius internally asked that all women be funneled into the weaving workshop, with pottery and bookbinding as alternatives. Nevertheless, several women made names for themselves, including the metalworker Marianne Brandt, whose slick, otherworldly teapots became icons of industrial design.

Visitors can also see reconstructions of fantastic wall murals (the originals were destroyed by a Nazi-appointed administration): Oskar Schlemmer's stylized human figures, a clear influence on Fritz Lang's 1927 film ""Metropolis,"" and geometric abstract compositions by Herbert Bayer, a member of Kandinsky's workshop after the Russian painter joined the faculty in 1922. That year also saw the temporary appointment of Theo van Doesburg, the founder of the Dutch De Stijl movement, who influenced Bauhaus's aesthetic shift toward constructivism. Only on a tour can visitors enter Gropius's faithfully reconstructed office, which was a showpiece for the first official Bauhaus exhibition in 1923. Like an antigravity Rubik's Cube, the entire room is defined by a square-within-a-square concept based partly on Renaissance ideas of proportion, from the seemingly floating arms of the rectangular wood-and-canvas armchair to a lighting system made of tubular bulbs affixed to aluminum rods by wooden linking cubes. The exhibition also included the nearby Haus am Horn, the school's first test house. Designed by Georg Muche, then the ""form master,"" or artistic director, of the Bauhaus weaving workshop, the house, with its flat roof and white facade, reflected the latest technical standards and industrial materials: cinder block walls, notoriously faulty Torfoleum insulation and opaque glass skirting boards. All were part of a shift from craft to industry. In his introduction to the 1923 exhibition, Gropius announced the school's revised motto: ""Art and technology -- a new unity.""

Though the 1923 exhibition was an art world sensation, it failed to pacify the increasingly conservative government of Thuringia, which had been funding the Bauhaus. Germany was buckling under economic hardship, which, together with the ideological aftershocks of World War I, had made it a breeding ground for nationalist ideas. With its avant-gardism and leftist leanings, Bauhaus had never been popular in Weimar, but when the Nazis joined the Thuringian parliament in 1924, the Bauhaus knew it was time to ship out. Before leaving, Gropius, a master shaper of public image, donated workshop objects to Weimar's State Art Collections, which today form the core of the 10,000-piece collection of the Bauhaus Museum at Theaterplatz, the oldest Bauhaus collection in the world. Though the objects mostly predate the great breakthroughs of the mid-1920s, there are worthy highlights, such as a reconstruction of Itten's glass ""Fire Tower,"" meant to epitomize the unity of artistic disciplines. The centenary will see the collection transferred to a new museum in Weimarhallenpark. In 1925, the Bauhaus moved to the rising factory town of Dessau, and work began on its new, radically modern headquarters, which would house everything from workshops to student accommodations.

It's impossible to experience the prismatic, cinematic effect of the Bauhaus Building without moving through and around it. The building looks out at itself, glass-and-steel grids that layer into lattice, creating ever-new angles and futuristic vistas. Glass curtain walls extend to transparent corners. Large panels of steel-framed glass windows open with the pull of a chain. The Gropius-designed metal door handles became the prototype that Germany essentially adopted en masse (Gropius tried, unsuccessfully, to sue for copyright infringement). It's not hard to trace a thread between the building and the layered transparencies and light play in the work of the Hungarian artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, who joined the Bauhaus in 1923 at age 28, replacing Itten, who had quit in protest of the school's shift toward industrial design. Moholy-Nagy, currently the subject of a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York, quickly became Gropius's most influential colleague. For visitors who want an immersive experience, the Bauhaus Dessau Foundation offers overnight stays in the Studio Building, which once housed junior masters and promising students. For 35 to 60 euros per night (about $40 to $67), you can rent a room featuring a vertiginous railed balcony. There is no Wi-Fi, and historical authenticity extends to the communal bathroom on each hall, but for the Bauhaus pilgrim, there's no better way to spend the night. Lying in a studio room, looking out huge paneled windows over the pitched red roofs of Dessau, I wondered what it must have been like for students inside this futuristic laboratory while, outside, a poverty-stricken Germany churned with reactionary chaos. What seems spartan today felt to many Bauhaus students, according to their written recollections, like paradise: a room and three meals a day, served in the Studio Building's first-floor canteen, which today offers hearty, no-frills German fare. The canteen connects to the auditorium, which features an expanded version of the geometrical tubular ceiling lighting system that debuted in Gropius's Weimar office, and an extraordinary linked system of tubular steel chairs, designed in 1926 by a 24-year-old Hungarian named Marcel Breuer. Many of the furniture pieces made famous later by Le Corbusier and Mies owe much to the bicycle-handlebar-inspired creations of Breuer.

Those interested in New Frankfurt can visit the Ernst-May-House, a small museum in a historically reconstructed residence within the Romerstadt Estate. There, visitors can step into the famous Frankfurt Kitchen designed in 1926 by the prodigious Margarete Schutte-Lihotzky, Austria's first female architect who was later active in the Nazi resistance. Inspired by railroad dining cars, Schutte-Lihotzky set out to devise a ""housewife's laboratory,"" offering maximum efficiency and hygiene within minimum space. Some 10,000 of her prefabricated kitchens were installed in new working-class apartments, becoming the prototype for the built-in kitchen now ubiquitous in the West. The construction of low-cost prefab housing became increasingly important to Gropius, who resigned from the Bauhaus in 1928 to devote himself to it. Moholy-Nagy left the same year, lamenting in his farewell speech the decline of the artist within the school and saying Klee and Kandinsky were there only ""to create atmosphere."" Gropius's successor, Hannes Meyer, a radical functionalist, reorganized the school, yet his staunch Communist affiliations led to the rise of a large Communist cell within the school. The press attacked, and Meyer resigned in 1930, heading to Moscow with a ""red Bauhaus brigade."" His pragmatic replacement, Mies, transformed Bauhaus in its latter years into a full-fledged school of architecture. A doorknob designed to disappear in a half-ball-shaped hole in the wall. Andreas Meichsner for The New York Times When the Nazis took control of the Dessau City Council, the Bauhaus was forced to move yet again. In 1932, Mies set up the school in an abandoned factory in Berlin, financing it with his own money. But in 10 months the Gestapo shut the Bauhaus down for good as Hitler rose to national power. Though the Bauhaus existed in Berlin for less than a year, the city is filled with remnants of the movement -- from the Bauhaus-Archiv, housed in a building along the Spree River that was one of Gropius's last designs, to the Museum Berggruen's collection of around 60 Paul Klee paintings and the Kandinskys of the Mies-designed Neue Nationalgalerie, which is expected to reopen for the centenary. Berlin's most substantial Bauhaus building is the ADGB Trade Union School in the suburb of Bernau, a zigzagging functionalist complex of brick, steel and glass surrounded by pine forests and the autobahn that was built in 1930 by the second Bauhaus director, Hannes Meyer.

The great irony of Nazi persecution of the Bauhaus is that driving it out of Germany only served to spread its ideas. ""Today remembering the Bauhaus is more important than ever,"" said Ms. Huskamp of the Dessau Foundation, referring to the refugee crisis and Germany's internal conflict about how to respond. ""In these times -- especially in Germany, where a lot of people want our society to close itself off more and more,"" she added, ""it's important to be aware of what it means to be open-minded, what it means to be international as a matter of course, of what it means to be modern.""

Food,How to Boil the Perfect Egg,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/23/dining/how-to-hard-boil-eggs.html,"To determine the best method for cooking boiled eggs, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt orchestrated a double-blind experiment at his restaurant, Wursthall, in San Mateo, Calif.



In his first column for The Times, J. Kenji Lopez-Alt tests his way to the best egg: perfectly peelable and tender throughout.

As a mostly stay-at-home dad responsible for all the meals in our household, I depend on a supply of boiled eggs in the refrigerator -- ready to be added to soups, salads, stews, sandwiches, stir-fries and tacos -- as an essential part of my planning. Years ago, in an effort to answer a perennial question -- what's the best way to boil an egg? -- I hatched a plan using the only method I know: lots and lots of testing. It was a multidecade endeavor. The series of tests I conducted variously as a kitchen monkey at Cook's Illustrated magazine, as recipe czar at the website Serious Eats and in researching my cookbook produced good data, but none of it felt definitive. Further home experimentations (there have been weeks when my wife, Adri, begged me to stop serving egg salad for dinner) have left unanswered questions and conflicting results. Do older eggs really peel more easily? (The internet insists they do.) Can an ice bath prevent green yolks? Is there anything the Instant Pot can't do better? I simply did not have enough data to say for certain.

With that in mind, for my first column on cooking and science for The New York Times, I decided to undertake my greatest egg-peeling experiment yet, and I have finally come up with some answers. Ninety-six volunteers came through my restaurant, Wursthall, in San Mateo, Calif., in August to peel and taste more than 700 eggs, cooked with various methods, making this -- as verified with a cursory search online -- the largest-ever double-blind egg-boiling-and-peeling experiment in the history of the universe. (If anyone from Guinness is reading, I have pretty extensive documentation.)

All of these tests were administered double-blind, meaning that neither the subjects nor the test administrators knew which eggs were which. Using the results, I designed a few subsequent experiments for another day of testing before drawing conclusions. I have bad news: There is no way to guarantee eggs that peel 100 percent of the time. But if 87 percent or higher is a number you can work with, let's crack on. [Read more from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt on how he uses the scientific method to make everyday cooking tastier and more efficient.] First, let me share my idea of a perfect boiled egg: It should be tender throughout, even when fully hard-boiled. The white should not be rubbery, nor the yolk chalky or green. And above all, it should peel easily. There are few frustrations greater than watching a chunky divot of egg white dislodge itself as you claw clumsily at the shell.

There are two stovetop cooking methods that allow preheating for a hot start, and produce eggs that are equally easy to peel: boiling and steaming. But taste tests showed that steamed eggs were more tender than their boiled counterparts. This is because steam is gentler than boiling water, allowing eggs to cook through without any hint of rubberiness in the whites or chalkiness in the yolks. Steaming an egg may take a minute longer than boiling it, but you save that time and more during setup: Bringing an inch of water to a boil is much faster than bringing a whole pot of water to a boil.

After testing three of the more popular time and temperature combinations on the Instant Pot (i.e., a pressure cooker), I unfortunately can't recommend using one. It's not any faster or easier than steaming eggs; the eggs are no easier to peel; and the time it takes various models of pressure cooker to achieve cooking pressure (and thus start the countdown timer) can vary widely, which makes the method unreliable. Moreover, blindfolded tasters confirmed that the whites were noticeably tougher (given the same internal yolk temperature). This makes sense, given the high cooking temperature achieved in a pressure cooker. Also not recommended: the briefly popular technique of baking eggs in their shells in a muffin tin. Some variables had little to no effect. Adding small amounts of vinegar, baking soda or salt to your water is pointless. None offer advantages for peeling, while at the extremes, vinegar and baking soda produce off-flavors and colors (ghostly blue egg whites!). The only difference between fridge-cold eggs and room temperature eggs is that room temperature eggs will cook about a minute faster.

What about freshness? Through my neighbor's connections with an underground cabal of backyard chicken owners, I wrangled over 100 eggs, from straight-from-the-oviduct to two days old, from backyard flocks across San Mateo. I compared them with supermarket eggs that were at least two weeks old. (Every carton of eggs sold in the United States is stamped with a three-digit number from 1 to 365, representing the day of the year they were packed.) Turns out that age doesn't make much of a difference either. Even eggs still warm from the hen's body peeled just as easily as the most grizzled specimen. (Taste tests also showed that most folks could not tell the difference between backyard eggs and supermarket eggs, and those who could were split on which were better.) Pricking the fat end of an egg with a pushpin doesn't affect how easily an egg peels, but it can prevent thin-shelled eggs from cracking under the pressure of gas expansion during boiling. It will also reduce the large dimple you often find at the fat end of the cooked egg, caused by the impression of an air pocket located there. Immediately dunking your cooked eggs in an ice bath will have a similar dimple-reducing effect, but it also makes them a little more difficult to peel. This result surprised me, as previous smaller-scale tests had suggested a slight advantage in peeling eggs that were iced; but when a mountain of new data doesn't fit your previous hypothesis, you change your hypothesis. An ice bath also did not help reduce the incidence of the sulfurous green patina around overcooked egg yolks -- eggs are so small that there is negligible carry-over cooking. If the yolk is green, it would have been green ice bath or no.

Even with evidence, I don't expect everyone to adopt the steaming technique, and that's fine. If you've got a method that works for you, stick with it (even if it's the Instant Pot). Science can deepen your understanding of the interaction between heat and molecules, between taste and pleasure. It can undoubtedly make you a better cook. But there is far more to cooking than the pure science of the craft. I'm not here to tell you how to cook or to try and change your traditions and habits; my only job is to show you the data, demonstrate the science and deliver a tasty recipe or two. Whether you use that information to change your everyday cooking, or perhaps just to volunteer unsolicited cooking tips to a perfectly capable brunch host, I hope you find something useful.

Travel,A Warm and Gooey Dish Steps Up in Zurich,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/21/travel/raclette-factory-zurich-restaurant-switzerland-review.html,"In Switzerland, melted cheese is a religion -- but there are, of course, rules about how to eat it.

Raclette, the gooey dish that is scraped from a ""loaf"" of roasted cheese and glopped over potatoes, is usually served at ski huts, festivals, Christmas markets, or just at home; it's rarely seen in Zurich restaurants. Nevertheless, Raclette Factory opened in December, offering the dish in a few new ways, in a casual setting.

""There are pizza, kebab, bratwurst and burger fast-food spots, but no raclette,"" said Rolf Suter, the restaurant's owner. ""We offer a unique experience by crossing tradition with modernism: Swiss heritage at a fast pace.""

On a recent snowy Friday, I visited the restaurant, in Zurich's cobblestoned old town, with three Swiss friends. Starters were straightforward: salads, soups and flammkuchen, an Alsatian pizza topped with creme fraiche and speck. ""Only an auslander"" -- a foreigner -- ""would eat that before a raclette,"" one of my friends said.

The main menu was a matrix of confusing options, even to my Swiss companions. The classic main dish is offered in a choice of plain, garlic, chile, peppercorn or smoked versions, all made with Swiss cow's milk cheese and sold by weight. It is served three different ways: pre-melted, self-cooked on the table over a painfully slow candlelit grill, or on an electric grill. Diners can choose a base of boiled potatoes, bread cubes or mashed potatoes. There is a raclette a discretion, an all-you-can-eat concept popular for apres-ski, and even a raclette takeout.

Style,Who Doesn't Like Being First?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/18/style/spring-2018-trends-shopping.html,"It's good to be ahead of the curve, especially when it comes to fashion. The spring 2018 collections, fresh off the runways, offered a little something for everyone. Provocateurs may gravitate toward the completely sheer (at Sonia Rykiel) or fringe laden (Calvin Klein); pragmatists will appreciate the abundance of blazers (Balenciaga), anoraks (Public School) and trench coats (Margiela). There were also some surprises: Bicycle shorts, which haven't seen the light of the runway in some time, showed up at Dolce & Gabbana, Off-White and Saint Laurent, a welcome addition for the shorts lover who's after more coverage but doesn't exactly yearn for baggy Bermudas. Here, a look at some of the trends -- and how to wear them now.

Blame it on the millennials: What began with that ubiquitous shade of ""millennial pink"" has inspired a taste for something sweet elsewhere in the spectrum. Baby blues, yellows and, of course, candy-coated pinks appeared in head-to-toe looks at Versace, Michael Kors and Hermes.

In the age of oversharing, there's no longer such a thing as TMI, even, or especially, as it applies to your wardrobe. The urge to bare, whether it's seen as refreshingly upfront or hopelessly narcissistic, was on display in the sheer looks at Dolce & Gabbana, Emilia Wickstead and Sonia Rykiel. Shy souls can dip their toes in the trend with tulle socks, while bolder sorts can layer a long-sleeve mesh turtleneck underneath a blouse or tee.

What's that about if it ain't broke, don't fix it? This season, designers adhered to a new adage: If it ain't broke ... break it.

Sports,"At the U.S. Open, Doubles, of All Things, Stays Stable",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/sports/tennis/us-open-doubles.html,"The men's and women's doubles draws at the United States Open this year are stacked with former Grand Slam doubles champions as well as new and exciting partnerships. While doubles may not have the same cachet as the singles tournaments among casual fans, there are still plenty of exciting players to watch -- some because they are paired up. Here are a few teams to watch out for as the week progresses: The two Colombians have paired together once again, and are going for their third Grand Slam doubles title after having won together at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2019. Although both are in their early 30s, their success has only come in the last few years. The two did not play together for the Australian Open this year, after Farah tested positive for anabolic steroids and was suspended from tournament play. Farah argued against the charge, and the International Tennis Federation rescinded his ban earlier this year. Kubot and Melo each hold two Grand Slam titles, including one they share from a victory at Wimbledon in 2017, and others from previous partnerships. The two have played together consistently since 2017, reaching the U.S. Open final in 2018 before losing to Mike Bryan and Jack Sock. They beat the top-seeded Cabal and Farah in the finals of the Mexican Open in February, and will hope to repeat that performance on the faster-paced courts in New York.

Ram and Salisbury are relatively new partners who began playing together consistently at the beginning of 2019. But they quickly showed their strengths, winning two tournaments in 2019, in Qatar and Vienna. They went on to win the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam for either of them. They will hope to take that momentum forward, especially considering that the U.S. Open hardcourts are most similar to the courts on which they secured their championship in Melbourne. The pair of 35-year-olds from the Balkans started playing together in the middle of last year, and quickly won two highly coveted titles in Cincinnati and at the China Open in Beijing. Dodig holds one Grand Slam title, from the 2015 French Open with Marcelo Melo, while his partner has not yet been past the semifinals of a Grand Slam. Dodig and Polasek also have collective experience. Together, they went to the semifinals of Wimbledon in 2019 as well as at the Australian Open this year. The two are an exceptionally formidable pair and will be sure to keep pushing for titles as they try to beat the clock.

Babos and Mladenovic have won three Grand Slam titles together, their latest coming at the Australian Open this year. Although Mladenovic has had some success on the singles tour, reaching a peak rating of No. 10, Babos is a doubles specialist. Babos and Mladenovic are also exceptionally dominant in the WTA Finals, where they have won for the past three years in a row. No doubt, even with the lengthy forced break, the pair will be back to their dominant winning ways. Mertens and Sabalenka, the defending champions, are two young and exceptionally talented players. In the last four Grand Slam tournaments, they have not lost before the quarterfinals, a rare level of consistency, especially for a pair that only began working together at the beginning of 2019. Both players are better known for their successes on the singles tour, but they have become the rare pair that can compete seriously in both formats, and should be paid more attention as they storm through the world of doubles.

This is the pair's first year playing together, and they struggled at the beginning of 2020, losing in the first round at the Australian Open. However, the pair has had some success separately in the past. Melichar reached the final at Wimbledon in 2018 in women's doubles as well as winning the title in mixed doubles. Xu reached the final at Wimbledon in 2019. Together, the two can be a formidable pair, especially on faster playing surfaces like Wimbledon or the U.S. Open. Peschke, at 45, and Schuurs, at 27, have one of the biggest age gaps in doubles tennis. They began working together at the beginning of the year, and while they have not had much success so far, their performances improved throughout the Australia swing at the beginning of 2020. Peschke, who previously played with Nicole Melichar, is an incredibly intelligent doubles player, and won Wimbledon in 2011 with Katarina Srebotnik. Schuurs has yet to make it past the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam, but has previously won three Premier titles, twice while paired up with singles No. 1 Ashleigh Barty and once with Elise Mertens. Here are a few more pairings to watch. The two singles specialists are pairing up for this year's doubles draw. Azarenka reached the finals last year alongside Ashleigh Barty, and has the potential to do so again with this year's Australian Open singles champion. This Midwestern duo reached the quarterfinals in Flushing last year, and Sock won the U.S. Open doubles championship in 2018 alongside Mike Bryan. These Americans are a pleasure to watch, and have the potential to go all the way. These two young Americans are rightly heralded as the future of American tennis. Although they lost in the third round of last year's U.S. Open to Victoria Azarenka and Ashleigh Barty, they are aggressive.","Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah return to defend their titles, as do Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, in two packed and experienced doubles draws.",b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/31/sports/31usopen-lineups-doubles-1/31usopen-lineups-doubles-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5cbb4fbefbff6c7396c836bbe560755ea57bd7aad930196bf6e253de51ea3677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Farah, right, and Juan Sebastián Cabal celebrated after winning men's doubles at the U.S. Open last year.",b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62,N24News/imgs/b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62.jpg,9
Science,"Babies' Cries May Foretell Their Adult Voices, a Study Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/science/baby-cries-pitch-speech-nyt.html,"The next time you hear a baby cry, take a good listen. It might tell you something about how its voice will sound decades later as an adult. Research has already shown that the pitch of a person's voice stays basically the same during adulthood and that how we sound as adults may be determined before puberty. A recent study indicated that the pitch of a boy's voice at age 7 can mostly predict what he will sound like as an adult. So when do our voices start emerging? One group of researchers hypothesized that differences in pitch would emerge very early -- even in babies who haven't yet learned how to speak. Now, their new research -- published last week in the journal Biology Letters -- indicates that the pitch of babies' cries at 4 months old may predict the pitch of their speech at age 5. In fact, the researchers said, the differences identifiable in babies' whines can explain 41 percent of the differences in voice pitch that appear by age 5.

Taken together with previous studies, they said, this suggests a discovery that may be surprising: that ""a substantial proportion"" of the difference between how we sound in adulthood may be traceable back to the time we spend in utero. Indeed, they said, that would explain why there are differences in baby screams so soon after birth. ""In utero, you have a lot of different things that can alter and impact your life -- not only as a baby, but also at an adult stage,"" said Nicolas Mathevon, a professor who studies animal behavior at the University of Lyon in France and was one of the authors of the study. ""This explains a lot, but not all,"" he added. ""It's only half the story I would say."" As for the rest? ""We don't know,"" he said. Carolyn Hodges-Simeon, an assistant professor of anthropology at Boston University who was not involved in the study, said research had shown that voice pitch affects our impressions of a person's physical and social dominance, attractiveness and trust, which can have real-world consequences. ""There aren't many studies that address these questions, so that makes this research especially intriguing,"" she said, noting that it ""suggests that individual differences in voice pitch may have their origins very, very early in development.""

To conduct their study, the team of five bioacoustic researchers recorded the voices of 15 French children -- six girls and nine boys -- from 4 to 5 years old. In each case, they had recordings of what they called ""mild discomfort cries"" that were obtained when the same children were from 2 to 5 months old. Previous research has shown that although adult human voices range significantly based on sex, there are no sex differences in the pitch of babies' cries or the speech of children before puberty. The new study reinforced those findings and also found that the pitch of babies' cries at 4 months old was ""a significant and substantial predictor of the pitch of their speech"" at age 5. Still, researchers cautioned that their sample size was small and noted that ""further investigations involving a larger sample"" -- especially one with more females -- were needed to confirm the correlations they found. Professor Mathevon said the researchers had begun their study with more children but lost contact with some families over time. He also emphasized that the children studied were all French, making it a culturally homogeneous group. It would have been better to have children from a variety of backgrounds, he said. ""It's extremely difficult to follow a group of children like this,"" he said. Professor Hodges-Simeon agreed that getting longitudinal data of this sort was difficult. ""With small sample sizes, there is a danger that it is not representative of the population as a whole,"" she said. ""However, if it is representative, then the relationship is likely a strong and robust one.""",New research indicates that the pitch of a baby's cries at 4 months old may predict the pitch of its speech at age 5.,78b1bc25-aed0-5c9e-813b-67995b657f9e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/31/us/11crying_xp/11crying_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=154e61c0c245489d3f6742a77a4ccd7fbb3e262f5cae5d73036507953123b4f9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,New research indicates that the pitch of babies' cries at 4 months may predict the pitch of their speech at age 5.,78b1bc25-aed0-5c9e-813b-67995b657f9e,N24News/imgs/78b1bc25-aed0-5c9e-813b-67995b657f9e.jpg,2
Travel,"In Oregon, a Little Hotel to Bring Out Your Inner Artist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/28/travel/where-to-stay-joseph-oregon-jennings-hotel.html,"Nine rooms, starting at $85 with a shared bath. Beyond promoting its status as ""World's First Kickstarter-Funded Hotel,"" the Jennings is an unusual hotel. The formerly dilapidated two-story brick building has a colorful history as a boardinghouse, a tattoo parlor and, if legend is to be believed, a brothel. And it is now the ambitious passion project of Greg Hennes, an artist who first came across the property in Joseph in 2010. It took ""almost four years of looking, dreaming and planning before I got my life to the place where I believed I could actually pull it off,"" said Mr. Hennes, who had been based in Portland. Having raised $107,000 through crowdfunding, Mr. Hennes turned to his friends -- a stable of well-known artists, architects and designers -- for the hotel's creative vision. The hotel's first remodeled room was ready for guests in 2015. Four additional rooms are set to roll out by Memorial Day 2018.

On the main street of Joseph (population: about 1,000), six hours east of Portland, the hotel is in the heart of the ""Alps of Oregon,"" with a view of the dramatic, pine-covered Wallowa Mountains and Joseph's attractive, sculpture-adorned downtown. Each room is the work of a single designer, including some big names like Brendon Farrell, who is responsible for the unique look of Portland's popular Loyly Spa and the Scandinavian-inspired Room 7 at the Jennings.

Spacious, light-filled Room 2 was designed by the Portland architect Ashley Tackett with a mix of white walls, exposed brick and roughly finished light wood floors accented with area rugs and animal skins. It had an unconventional configuration, with both a queen-sized bed and a twin in the entrance alcove. The living area had a black velour couch, a desk equipped with a sturdy, marble-based lamp and a back door that opened onto the hotel's wide porch, where there was a small bistro-style table. Idiosyncratic touches included a large format photograph of a cowgirl in a leopard print shirt, and a coffee table with secret hatches that opened to reveal two carefully selected books of poetry: ""Mountain Echoes"" by Jim Whilt and ""American Primitive"" by Mary Oliver.

The shared bath area had three rooms: a changing room with a shelf of charcoal gray and white Turkish towels and heatproof, break-proof black rubber water cups, a Scandinavian-style cedar sauna with a squat wooden bucket and ladle for pouring water onto the hot stones, and a bathroom with black and white octagonal tiles and a rain shower. Sauna instructions are scrawled artfully on the bath's sliding wooden door. In keeping with its unconventional style, the Jennings has no lobby. Instead, it has an airy common room with a large wooden dining table, a well-equipped communal kitchen and a library that includes Audubon guides to local foliage alongside works by Don DeLillo and Henry David Thoreau, a Ouija board and a record player. The hotel offers free Wi-Fi, though it was a bit spotty during my stay. Though the Jennings doesn't offer room service, guests can prepare meals in the shared kitchen. With an in-house residency for artists, a new nonprofit school for traditional crafts and cooking (called The Prairie Mountain Folk School) and renovation work underway on the remaining five rooms (even as guests occupy the existing rooms), the hotel is a work in progress -- the next best thing to staying in an artist's studio.","Promoted as the ""World's First Kickstarter-Funded Hotel,"" the Jennings Hotel in Joseph, Ore., is the next best thing to staying in an artist's studio.",6de59a4e-2caa-50aa-beec-554135b59f28,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/05/travel/05CheckIn-Oregon3/05CheckIn-Oregon3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b839f36bebeb4b05ee148f824883b05c46f65da00b0e6f947042e020cdd459fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Room 8 at the Jennings Hotel, designed by Greg Hennes with vintage field desk and quilt by Zena Verda Pesta.",6de59a4e-2caa-50aa-beec-554135b59f28,N24News/imgs/6de59a4e-2caa-50aa-beec-554135b59f28.jpg,4
Style,How Burning Man Has Evolved Over Three Decades,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/style/burning-man-sex-tech.html,"A dust storm overwhelmed the road to Burning Man this week. Clouds of billowing white dust obscured the caravan of cars snaking through the barren Nevada desert, according to recent news reports. Travelers parked in ditches and covered their faces with kerchiefs until the squall passed. The drive is an August ritual for more than 70,000 attendees who have descended upon Black Rock City for nearly three decades and are gathered this week to build colossal art installations and dance nude in the scorching summer heat. First came the artist hippies in the 1990s. Insanely rich tech moguls arrived on their private jets two decades later. Models and celebrities followed. Last year, politics seeped into the parade of whirligigs and hat-festooned cyclists when a group of President Trump impersonators arrived, and booths were set up for voter education. And in what may be a nod to how mainstream the counterculture jubilee has become, sculptures from the festival are on display for the first time at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington.

""It has become almost a cliche at this point,"" Mr. Kelly said in an interview. Burning Man ""is, maybe, aspirational."" [Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter to get a look at what you need to know to begin your day.] The first event was held in 1986 when the founder, Larry Harvey, gathered a group of friends at Baker Beach in San Francisco, where he torched an eight-foot-tall wooden man. Lore suggests he was commemorating the end of a romantic relationship. Each year, more friends -- and even more strangers -- showed up to watch. The fire marshals came, too, and demanded Mr. Harvey and his band of merrymakers go away. The event moved to Black Rock Desert, about 140 miles north of Reno, in 1990. The New York Times Magazine wrote about Burning Man in 1994 when it was a (relatively) low-key three-day event over Labor Day weekend. ""1,600 people came to stare into the fire,"" The Times wrote. The man-like statue was 40 feet tall and made of wood and neon lights, and the festival was described as a spiritual-mystical experience and ""an excuse to party in the desert.""

The festivities had a techno hippie carnival feel (think exhibitionism, drugs and body paint) which later turned into something of a sprawling frat party for the technogentsia (think exhibitionism, drugs and body paint). At its heart, Burning Man embraced anti-consumerism and an ethos that embraced radical self-expression. ""If all your self-worth and esteem is invested in how much you consume, how many likes you get or other quantifiable measures,"" Mr. Harvey told The Atlantic in 2014, ""the desire to simply possess things trumps our ability or capability to make moral connections with people around us."" But while the festival is based on the ethos of inclusivity, underrepresentation has persisted. In Burning Man's 2017 census, 77 percent of attendees identified as Caucasian, 4.9 as Hispanic, and 1 percent as black. A new short documentary, ""In Pursuit of Happiness: Black at Burning Man,"" explores the disparity, interviewing many black attendees about their range of experiences -- some positive, some negative.

Mr. Harvey, the founder, was criticized after an interview with The Guardian in 2015 in which he said, ""I don't think black folks like to camp as much as white folks."" He said then too that the organization had previously hired a diversity consultant, but that it would not set up racial quotas. [Read more about the documentary and an interview with the filmmaker, Gina Levy.] By the early 2000s, more than 25,000 people made the trek to Black Rock, many of them from the San Francisco Bay Area and Europe. In 2000, Rick Marin, a writer for The Times, went with a group of Silicon Valley friends and described a scene both enthralling and ridiculous. Their happy-face pinata went missing. They camped on Anal Avenue. He met a Black Rock Ranger, a member of the group that polices the grounds, named ""nude Marty."" Mr. Marin was happiest, though, at Space Cowboy, a tented, themed rave where he was welcomed by a group clad in Western gear. ""Besides the nudity, the lure of Burning Man is aesthetic,"" he wrote.

Outsiders sought to capitalize on the festival's carefree-for-all attitude. In 2002, festival organizers sued Voyeur Video, which videotaped nude participants for five years and sold the tapes for $29.95 on a pornographic website. According to a complaint filed in July 2002, people were filmed changing clothes or in their private campsites. Burning Man prevailed and the videos were no longer sold. It is perhaps not surprising in this era of #MeToo that Burning Man, which prides itself on its sex-positive ethos, stresses the importance of consensual sex. Since 2012, it has outlined procedures for dealing with sexual assault in a series of blog posts on its website. It also addresses consent in its survival guide.

What has changed is that the festival, like an old San Francisco neighborhood, has became gentrified. In 2011, tickets sold out for the first time, according to The Times. Scalped tickets were hawked for exorbitant prices. Then the billionaires showed up. Burning Man is based on a giving economy, with nothing bought or sold except coffee and ice. But the newest crop of technology millionaires and billionaires to arrive began to overtly flex their financial muscle. They hired Sherpas to set up air-conditioned camps, and pack out trash. They brought in chefs to cook elaborate feasts in tricked-out recreational vehicles. Then the models and celebrities arrived. Last year, Paris Hilton was a D.J. Burners bemoaned the seeming end of Burning Man. In 2016, the Burning Man website posted a funny sendup of all the ways the festival was ruined. Mr. Doherty had this take: The festival evolved. ""It is a microcosm of what is happening in society,"" he said. ""Everyone is as comfortable as they can afford."" Added Mr. Kelly: ""Now it is almost like a huge conference. There is an agenda. There are scheduled seminars."" In the beginning, he said, ""it was the individual experience.""","Every year thousands make the pilgrimage to the Nevada desert to dance, do drugs and make colossal art.",ec32d00e-3faa-5cc4-8676-6bf79d6b888a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/29/arts/00xp-burningman-wide/00xp-burningman-wide-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=97a3213117b163946219ea99faf4f9643a3d12b7d8a81ec6c958a77284c4019e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Evening falling at Burning Man in 2006 in Black Rock Desert, Nev.",ec32d00e-3faa-5cc4-8676-6bf79d6b888a,N24News/imgs/ec32d00e-3faa-5cc4-8676-6bf79d6b888a.jpg,15

Doctors Without Borders, which has been in Borno State since 2014, reported in November that it was seeing hardly any children under age 5 at its clinics, hospitals and feeding centers.

Technology,Snap Stumbles Through Another Disappointing Quarter,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/10/technology/snap-stumbles-through-another-disappointing-quarter.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Ever since Snap, the maker of the messaging app Snapchat, went public in March, the company has become a closely watched barometer for Silicon Valley and Wall Street. The technology world is scrutinizing Snap as an indicator of whether smaller social media companies can compete with behemoths like Facebook. And Wall Street is using Snap to gauge whether investors will embrace other unprofitable tech companies if they go public. Snap has not delivered on either front. Over the past few months, the once-buzzy company has faced a litany of issues. Facebook's photo-sharing app Instagram, as well other Facebook apps that have copied Snapchat's main features, have been growing more rapidly than Snapchat. In May, Snap reported disappointing earnings, its first as a public company. Its stock has since plunged well below its $17 public offering price. Snap will soon face a make-or-break year, said Norm Johnston, the chief strategy officer at Mindshare, a global media agency. ""Either it will realize its full potential by delivering growth in daily users, or it will end up as the next Twitter,"" the social media service that has been grappling with stalled growth, he said.

On Thursday, Snap did little to change its trajectory when it reported quarterly earnings that missed Wall Street projections. The company reported a loss of 36 cents a share, versus estimates of a 33-cent loss. Revenue rose to $181.7 million, versus expectations for $185.8 million. The company recorded a wider quarterly loss than a year ago of $443.1 million, up from $115.9 million. User growth was a mixed bag. The user base grew by 21 percent over the past year to 173 million, which was slower than analysts had expected. But the bulk of that growth came from North America, showing that the company can still expand in highly lucrative advertising markets like the United States. The average amount of revenue made per user increased by 109 percent over the year to $1.05. 

 ""We've been working closely with our advertisers to improve our offerings and become a more integral part of their strategy,"" said Imran Khan, the chief strategy officer at Snap. He said that existing customers were also spending more money with the company. Snap shares fell by more than 16 percent in after-hours trading after the company released its numbers. The stock's performance is being closely watched as a measure of tech start-ups in the public markets. Snap and the online meal kit company Blue Apron, which lowered its offering price when it went public in June and is dealing with a declining stock, are casting a pall over other potential initial public offerings. For Snap, there have long been signs that it would face bumps as a public company. Before its I.P.O., the company said it was losing money and made no guarantee that those losses would subside. Snap also said that its user growth rate was slowing and that it did not have a firm international expansion plan.

""Snap was massively overvalued because, as a private company, it could set a valuation based on the opportunity for growth,"" said Brian Wieser, a senior research analyst at Pivotal Research Group. Evan Spiegel, a chief executive and founder, and Bobby Murphy, another founder of Snap, also maintain control of the company's voting rights. That means that no matter how dissatisfied shareholders become, they have no direct say in corporate strategy or management. If shareholders are unhappy, the only way they can make their voices heard is to sell their shares. Mr. Spiegel said during a call with analysts that neither he nor Mr. Murphy would sell their stock this year. ""We believe deeply in the long-term success of Snap,"" Mr. Spiegel said. For a few months, Snap's stock stayed above its I.P.O. price. But investor doubts began to set in as Snap's user growth continued to slow, especially as rivals like Instagram began copying innovative features that once set Snapchat apart, including augmented reality images and disappearing content. More alarmingly, concern over Snap's advertising business started to rise. Some brands are beginning to question whether Snapchat is a niche product, like Twitter, or an essential piece of their digital marketing strategy, like Facebook or Google, said several advertising buyers. Last month, Morgan Stanley, which helped underwrite Snap's I.P.O., issued a report on the company that questioned the measurement tools that Snap makes for advertisers. These tools are regarded as subpar compared with the ones offered by Facebook, which is important because the tools help brands determine whether an ad was effective. ""The reality is they still lag behind most of the competition in fundamental audience targeting and measurement,"" said Sean Corcoran, an executive director at MullenLowe Mediahub, a digital advertising firm. Mr. Corcoran said that it was more difficult to target ads at particular Snapchat users and to measure clicks on ads in Snapchat compared with other social networks.



Snap has introduced new tools for advertisers this year to make it easier to buy and manage ads on Snapchat. It also teamed with companies that can help measure and predict the effectiveness of specific marketing tactics on Snapchat. Snap now measures whether customers shop in stores after they see ads and in June, it confirmed it acquired a start-up called Placed that tracks retail foot traffic. ""We're encouraged by the early performance of our self-service platform, which makes it easy for advertisers of all sizes to reach our unique audience,"" said Mr. Khan. On a call with analysts, he said that 60 percent of all Snap ad impressions were now delivered through those tools. Mr. Spiegel has long maintained that the amount of time that users spend in Snapchat makes it unique. The average user spends more than 30 minutes a day in the app. And in the most recent quarter, users under the age of 25, a demographic that advertisers covet, are spending more than 40 minutes a day in the app. He told analysts that it could become less costly to advertise on Snapchat, a platform that has been notoriously expensive. ""Lower pricing is an important driver of growth at this stage,"" Mr. Spiegel said, and the change could get more advertisers to learn how to use Snap.

Dance,Review: City Dancers Unleashed in the Wild,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/arts/dance/review-BalletCollective.html,"PINE PLAINS, N.Y. -- The Mashomack Fish & Game Preserve Club, a few hours' drive north of New York City, is not the natural habitat of dancers, at least not of members of New York City Ballet and the Martha Graham Dance Company. But this is where I observed them participating in the normal behavior of their species: performing live.

The occasion, on Friday evening, was the premiere by BalletCollective of ""Natural History,"" a new work by Troy Schumacher, a City Ballet soloist who has long presented his choreography through the independently run collective, which he founded in 2010. That side gig has now become more central, more necessary.

City Ballet has been all-digital since March and will stay that way through the fall. The same is true of the Graham troupe. If the current members of BalletCollective -- five from City Ballet, two from Graham -- were going to dance in person, they would have to find a way themselves. And, as in the example of Kaatsbaan, 15 miles from here, which has been presenting dance outdoors on the weekends since early August, planting a stage in a field upstate seems a good idea.

The collective certainly discovered a lovely spot, at the edge of a pond backed by low hills. This preserve and upscale hunting club is in horse country, with stables and a polo club nearby. The area is bucolic yet cultivated. The small audience was arranged on a grassy incline above the makeshift stage, socially distanced on blankets and camp chairs or in cars, tailgate or drive-in style. In the cool of the evening, as the setting sun dazzled the water, it felt like a fine setting for a civilized entertainment.",Our critic reveled in the fact that the only thing separating him from BalletCollective performers was the late-summer air.,81e597ce-98d5-5559-8d3f-22c832a7adcd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/15/arts/13natural-history2/13natural-history2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=703de6dd29bc62943951bd7d86e22ebc0947a034f5a917d5c2eba896bc09493d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"BalletCollective&rsquo;s &ldquo;Natural History,&rdquo; a new work by Troy Schumacher.",81e597ce-98d5-5559-8d3f-22c832a7adcd,N24News/imgs/81e597ce-98d5-5559-8d3f-22c832a7adcd.jpg,6
Science,Coverage of Arctic Sea Ice Shrinks to a Winter Low,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/science/coverage-of-arctic-sea-ice-shrinks-to-a-winter-low.html," The National Snow and Ice Data Center, a government-sponsored research group, said that in late February ice cover in the Arctic Ocean reached its maximum extent, 5.61 million square miles, which is about 7 percent less than the average from 1981 to 2010 and about 1 percent less than the previous lowest year, 2011. The center said that changes in the jet stream created warmer than normal conditions on the Pacific side of the Arctic. While the extent of Arctic sea ice is naturally variable, it has been generally declining over the past several decades as the region warms more quickly than other parts of the planet.","There was less sea ice coverage in the Arctic this winter than in any year since satellite measurements began nearly four decades ago, researchers said Thursday.",d1aed3c9-2e16-5afd-bfab-d954ec6ad164,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/21/science/20briefs-Icebrief/20briefs-Icebrief-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=96b8dd6a8c66eb46c0d8b9e2e63b9dbe4640718ca4a8216e6bb4cb4c356a6155&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The glaciers and landscape in northeast Greenland, April 2013.",d1aed3c9-2e16-5afd-bfab-d954ec6ad164,N24News/imgs/d1aed3c9-2e16-5afd-bfab-d954ec6ad164.jpg,2

(A reader named Alberto affixed a note to the recipe describing his own parents' journey from China to Guatemala in the late 1930s. His mother, he said, had to adapt her cooking to the locally available ingredients. So instead of rice wine in her beef and broccoli, he said, she used rum!)

Thursday night: Samin Nosrat's Roman egg drop soup. That'll change the color of your mood ring.

And then run out the week on Friday with spicy big tray chicken, a dish Mark Bittman learned to make a bunch of years ago at Spicy Village in Manhattan's Chinatown. Mark marinates the meat and doesn't use MSG. I don't and I do. It's fantastic.

Real Estate,Checklist for Winning a Bidding War,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/19/realestate/how-to-win-a-bidding-war.html,"Coming up with a winning bid requires foresight. Here are some tips for navigating a fast-moving market.

Get preapproved for a mortgage. Not to be confused with a prequalification, preapproval from a lender is a pretty strong indicator of your ability to obtain financing. Without that assurance, sellers may discard your bid.

Enlist seasoned professionals. An experienced real estate agent can give you a heads up about coming listings and guide you through the process. Working with a mortgage professional who knows the local market can also help.

Go in strong at the start. Figure out the most you can afford, and bid accordingly. ""If it's meant to be, you'll get it,"" says Caroline Baccellieri of McClellan Sotheby's International Realty in Pelham, N.Y. ""But don't go to a point where you think it's going to be too much to handle."" Also, if you're offering more than the asking price, be aware that your mortgage lender may appraise the home at a lower value -- which could leave you on the hook for the difference.",Tips for navigating a fast-moving real estate market.,c54d2f7e-8960-5c29-aea5-49d5ab2db8f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/19/realestate/19COVERWEB1/19COVERWEB1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=8551107242cfb83e59b9d9f306682da71a7020c1778b0576f07b8aa9ba54ed58&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An open house for a Victorian in Montclair, N.J., drew quite a crowd.

Economy,What Is Lost by Burying the Trans-Pacific Partnership?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/12/business/economy/donald-trump-trade-tpp-trans-pacific-partnership.html,"WASHINGTON -- Congressional leaders confirmed this week what seemed inevitable with the triumph of Donald J. Trump: The far-reaching trade agreement with 11 other Pacific Rim nations that President Obama hoped to leave as a major legacy, but which Mr. Trump called ""a terrible deal,"" is dead. Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the incoming Democratic leader, told labor leaders on Thursday that the pending Trans-Pacific Partnership, the largest regional trade agreement in history, would not be approved by Congress. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said flat-out ""no"" when reporters on Wednesday asked whether the agreement would be considered in the lame-duck Congress that convenes next week -- its last legislative chance, given the opposition from the president-elect. Mr. Trump, whose invectives against trade agreements were central to his appeal to disaffected working-class voters, will have the authority as president ""to negotiate better deals, as I think he would put it,"" Mr. McConnell said. Yet there is little likelihood of Mr. Trump seeking a new agreement. That reflects not only his campaign statements, but also his yearslong hostility to past trade accords as well as the sheer difficulty of renegotiating a Pacific pact that was seven years in the making, entailing compromises among a dozen countries including Australia, Canada, Chile and Japan, but excluding China.

Another broad trade deal still being negotiated, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership between Europe and the United States, is a likely casualty of the Trump election and a global backlash against trade. The discussions ""are dead, and I think everybody knows it,"" Matthias Fekl, the French secretary of state for trade, said Friday as trade ministers met in Brussels. ""Globalization has created lots of losers, lots of difficulties."" Mr. Obama faces the prospect of many of his signature achievements dying or being pared back dramatically during the Trump administration. The president-elect and congressional leaders have vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Trump has said he will pull the United States out of last year's Paris climate agreement and kill off Mr. Obama's global warming regulations. The Dodd-Frank law regulating Wall Street could be carved up. But the Trans-Pacific Partnership, painstakingly negotiated but little understood, will be buried with few in either party to mourn it. It was hailed by its negotiators as the most sophisticated such deal ever, establishing the rules of commerce that would rope both sides of the Pacific together into a 21st-century economy, while cementing the United States' alliance with Asia. Which raises the question: What would be lost by abandoning it, for the nation and for specific industries from Hollywood to America's ranches and farmlands?

""Popular understanding of the T.P.P. is very low,"" Kevin G. Nealer, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, wrote in a postelection analysis on Thursday. With its abandonment, he added, ""The risk to America's role as trade policy leader -- and therefore to the global economy -- is real and immediate."" Mr. Obama and his team likewise emphasized the potential geopolitical blow, even as they promoted the economic benefits the trade agreement would offer American exporters by eliminating thousands of tariffs and other trade restrictions in the other countries. Forsaking the agreement, the president insisted, would undercut the United States' standing in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific region as a reliable counterweight to an expansionary China, economically and militarily, for America's allies there. The other countries have approved the pact or are in the process of doing so, but without the approval of the United States, it does not take effect. That tension could well be evident later this month, when Mr. Obama and his trade representative, Michael B. Froman, attend the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit.
* What happened on Day 2 of Elizabeth Holmes's testimony.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. The Americans will have to explain their failure on the trade agreement to foreign leaders gathered in Lima, Peru, while China's leader, Xi Jinping, is there seeking progress toward an emerging alternative to the Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, known as R.C.E.P., which includes China, Japan and 14 other Asian countries but excludes the United States. ""In the absence of T.P.P., countries have already made it clear that they will move forward in negotiating their own trade agreements that exclude the United States,"" Mr. Obama's Council of Economic Advisers wrote days before the election. ""These agreements would improve market access and trading opportunities for member countries while U.S. businesses would continue to face existing trade barriers.""

One example is a bilateral agreement between Australia and Japan, which gives Australian beef exporters a price advantage over American producers whose exports are subject to higher Japanese tariffs; those tariffs would ultimately have been removed under the Pacific agreement. ""We are experiencing lost sales without T.P.P."" of about $400,000 a day as a result, said Kevin Kester, a California cattle rancher and vice president of the National Cattlemen's Beef Association. ""Multiply that over several hundred more products and several dozen more free-trade relationships,"" Mr. Froman said in an interview. The T.P.P. would have phased out some 18,000 tariffs that the other 11 countries have on imports from the United States, thus reducing their cost to foreign buyers. Beyond such typical trade actions, it also would have established a number of precedents for international trade rules dealing with digital commerce, intellectual property rights, human rights and environmental protection.

For the first time in a trade agreement, state-owned businesses like those in Vietnam and Malaysia would have had to comply with commercial trade rules and labor and environmental standards. The agreement would have committed all parties to the International Labor Organization's principles prohibiting child labor, forced labor and excessive hours, and requiring collective bargaining, a minimum wage and safe workplaces. While unions and human rights groups remained skeptical about enforcement, the United States reached separate agreements with Brunei, Malaysia and Vietnam in which the three countries committed to specific labor changes, under penalty of the United States' restoring tariffs for noncompliance. Those side agreements will fall along with the overall trade pact. Election-year antitrade politics aside, the biggest hurdle to Republicans' consideration of the Pacific pact was objections from some -- led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, chairman of the committee responsible for trade -- to intellectual-property provisions that would have limited monopoly protections for brand-name pharmaceutical companies' so-called biologics. Those are advanced drugs used, for instance, in cancer treatments. The Obama administration -- pressed by nearly every other nation, the generic drug industry and nonprofit health groups like Doctors Without Borders, all of which wanted quicker access to affordable lifesaving drugs -- had agreed that drugmakers could keep production data secret for five to eight years, fewer than the 12 years in federal law. Mr. Hatch had demanded 12 years. But administration officials were hindered in how far they could go to appease Republicans given strong opposition in other countries to any change. Without the trade agreement, however, drug companies have no monopoly protections for biologics data in some countries. Democrats, organized labor and the Ford Motor Company were especially opposed to the trade agreement because it did not include what they considered enforceable protections against other countries' manipulation of their currency's value to gain price advantages for their products. The pact did have a side agreement that, in another first for trade accords, included the parties' ""joint declaration"" against currency manipulation, required them to report interventions in exchange markets and set annual meetings to discuss any disputes. Another innovation in the T.P.P. was provisions to help small businesses, which lack the resources of big corporations, to navigate export rules, trade barriers and red tape.

Opponents on the left were especially critical of the agreement for opening the door to more foreign subsidiaries being able to go to special trade tribunals to sue to block local, state or federal policies -- environmental or consumer safety rules, say -- on grounds that the rules conflict with corporations' rights under the trade pact. The administration, however, countered that the trade agreement actually reformed the so-called Investor-State Dispute Settlement tribunals, which are a longstanding feature of trade policy. It called for changes responding to criticisms that the tribunals favor corporations and interfere with nations' efforts to protect public health and safety.","Few in Washington will mourn the trade pact, but it would have set precedents in digital commerce, intellectual property rights, human rights and environmental protection.",125a6d9c-49b7-587f-ad20-cc6f41e76fbd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/12/world/12TRADE-1/12TRADE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=1810aa5bc360d1633aad32c8abcb84b6229635b322d17c486c382991823d497e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Vice President-elect Mike Pence, Senator Mitch McConnell, President-elect Donald J.

Consolation has been observed in animals like chimpanzees and elephants, but it was thought to require a cognitively advanced brain -- which the small rodents lack.

""These voles are not smart, so this is not an intelligence thing,"" said Larry J. Young, a neuroscientist at Emory University and one of the study's authors. ""Some kind of gut instinct causes them to respond intuitively to the stress of others.""

Dr. Young and his colleagues report their findings in the journal Science.

In a laboratory, the researchers stressed voles with beeps and light shocks. ""As soon as voles see another distressed vole, somehow they detect it and they start licking and grooming it,"" Dr. Young said.

Voles are social animals and they are monogamous.

Real Estate,A Renter Does the Math,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/27/realestate/a-renter-does-the-math.html,"Soon after his arrival in New York from San Francisco two years ago, David Park took a rental at the Beatrice, rising high above the Eventi Hotel on West 29th Street. He loved his small studio, 475 contemporary square feet with a great view and a central location. After a year there, he was joined by his boyfriend, Mark Burleson, whom he'd met through friends. Mr. Burleson, who is from rural Tennessee, had been renting with roommates in Washington Heights. He had moved so often, he said, that ""my grandmother said I have to get an address book just for you."" Last fall, Mr. Park calculated two years' worth of outlay for rent, which had risen from the high $2,000s to the low $3,000s. The sum came to a horrifying $72,000 -- enough for a down payment.

""I didn't think about it once a month, but when I go back, it shocks me,"" said Mr. Park, 28, who was born in Ohio, has an information systems degree from Carnegie Mellon University and works as an interaction designer at the shopping site gilt.com. FULTON STREET Someone had already made an offer on a large studio in a building called District in the financial district. Ashok Sinha for The New York Times Mr. Burleson encouraged him to buy a place. ""David is very much about spending his money wisely,"" said Mr. Burleson, 42, a graduate of Middle Tennessee State University and the United States training manager for Longchamp, the leather goods retailer. ""Before we go to a restaurant, if there are eight pages of reviews, he will read at least four pages of them. It is the one-stars he is looking at."" They conferred with Mark Ski of Town Residential, a friend of Mr. Burleson's, who emphasized the need to be ready to pounce, because a place they liked ""is going to be gone in a second,"" he said. With a budget of up to $695,000, Mr. Park went on the hunt for a condominium, preferably in a new building, intending to leave a 10 percent down payment. ""Price was the most important factor,"" he said. He would be making the purchase, with Mr. Burleson contributing to the mortgage payments.

MYRTLE AVENUE Another party also beat the potential buyers to a one-bedroom at the high-rise Toren in Downtown Brooklyn. Ashok Sinha for The New York Times The men didn't mind a studio. ""There was never a time where either of us needed space or needed to get away from the other,"" Mr. Burleson said. Both liked a sunny rectangular studio with almost 600 square feet at the amenity-filled District on Fulton Street in the financial district. The asking price was $698,000, with monthly charges of almost $600. But the seller already had an offer and the deal was moving along, so the couple lost out. Disappointed, they visited some of Brooklyn's new high-rises, including Toren, where a one-bedroom with more than 600 square feet was listed for a comparatively low $525,000. Monthly charges were a little over $600. Again, there was already a high offer -- $551,000. ""I knew it wasn't going to be easy, but I didn't expect to get rejected every time, so I was getting worried,"" Mr. Park said. ""I thought in Brooklyn it would be easier to find a place, but it wasn't any easier."" WEST 30th A one-bedroom in a former hotel in Manhattan had an iffy layout and an uncertain occupancy date. Ashok Sinha for The New York Times Back in Manhattan, south of Penn Station, they saw a 560-square-foot one-bedroom with a small study for $645,000 at the former Irvin Hotel for Women, circa 1925. Monthly charges were around $900. But there was no obvious place for a couch and a television, and the interior was still unfinished. The couple, facing an expiring lease, were unwilling to wait.

Mr. Park had skipped a listing for a studio on Thompson Street in one of Greenwich Village's few condominiums, assuming it would be too small. Mr. Ski, however, suggested he consider it. So he did. The studio was indeed small, about 425 square feet, ""but it's New York and there is a trade-off,"" Mr. Ski said. Mr. Park liked the central location and the rectangular layout. The asking price was $699,000, with monthly charges in the low $300s. ""It wasn't my dream apartment,"" Mr. Park said, ""because it wasn't new construction and it didn't feel as modern as my last place, so I still had some reservations.""",Rent can amount to a hefty annual outlay.

Stern-designed building in Harlem, became a canvas that spelled out ""Black Lives Matter."" ""This tribute displayed on our windows loudly proclaims that black lives have always mattered and will always matter,"" Uzodinma Iweala, the Africa Center's chief executive, told a gathering in the center's courtyard. ""It makes clear that the Africa Center supports this movement's fight against all forms of injustice that black people face."" The ceremony was one of several ways that cultural organizations across New York City marked the Juneteenth holiday, which Mr. Iweala said celebrates ""freedom, strength, resilience and the moral power of love.""

The New York Public Library and the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture organized a discussion of the holiday to be broadcast on Zoom and YouTube. The Brooklyn Public Library scheduled a concert to be streamed on Facebook and the Brooklyn Museum organized poetry readings and sign making in its plaza. And the Metropolitan Opera offered a week of free streaming on its website of performances by black singers including the soprano Leontyne Price, the bass-baritone Eric Owens and the tenor Lawrence Brownlee. The celebrations come at an urgent moment, a month after the killing of George Floyd set off a national conversation about race. The police officer who knelt on Mr. Floyd's neck has been charged with murder. Mr. Iweala in his remarks at the Africa Center mentioned that the holiday is tinged by mourning and anger that accompanies the memory of black men and women who have died.

The center, which began as the Museum for African Art, had initially been envisioned strictly as a cultural organization but eventually broadened its mission to include business and policy programming related to Africa and the role of people of African descent in the world. After years of delays, the center completed one gallery in 2019 and opened to the public. A second gallery was completed earlier this year just before the coronavirus pandemic forced the center's temporary closing. Mr. Iweala said that he expected the rest of the center to open in perhaps two more phases spaced out over the next few years as the museum continues to raise money for construction. In addition to Mr. Iweala, speakers at the center on Fifth Avenue at East 110 Street included Manhattan Borough President Gale Brewer; Gonzalo Casals, the city's Cultural Affairs commissioner; Joyous Pierce, executive director of the Harlem Arts Alliance; and the graffiti artist, rapper and actor Fred Brathwaite, known as Fab 5 Freddy.",The Africa Center posted the Black Lives Matter sign as cultural organizations across the city offered programming in the spirit of the holiday.,d4b68db0-8f85-5193-b31b-17d749198510,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/19/arts/19banner02/19banner02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=db5efeaeaf436108390e502ce61b2801e565fa16501d4ba20d54013db75d43f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Black Lives Matter sign occupies a wall at the Africa Center in Harlem.,d4b68db0-8f85-5193-b31b-17d749198510,N24News/imgs/d4b68db0-8f85-5193-b31b-17d749198510.jpg,14

(Speaking of stews and soups and the riotously flavorful, if you have some lobster stock in the freezer, this would be a good week to make lobster bisque.)

Even more simply, tonight might be a good one for chicken teriyaki. Or for pepper fried rice. You could make Melissa's recipe for seared lamb chops with anchovies, capers and sage. (Serve with potatoes ""tostones."") Or you could just pick up some fish and fresh tortillas, and knock out fish tacos for the family.

Global Business,Critics of Executive Pay Put Pressure on Novartis,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/business/global/for-daniel-vasella-of-novartis-78-million-to-keep-secrets.html,"LONDON -- A plan by Novartis, one of Switzerland's biggest drug makers, to pay its departing chairman $78 million to keep him from sharing his knowledge with competitors has added fuel to an already heated debate about executive pay.

The announcement of the payment to the chairman, Daniel Vasella, was made last Friday, just two weeks before a Swiss referendum to give shareholders more power to determine executive compensation. Mr. Vasella, who had previously said that he would step down as chairman at Novartis's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, is to receive the sum, 72 million Swiss francs, over six years.

In a statement, Mr. Vasella said that ""it has been very important to Novartis that I refrain from making my knowledge and know-how available to competitors and to take advantage of my experience with the company."" He added that the annual payments were ""according to fair market value"" and that he decided to use the money for ""philanthropic activities.""","The drug maker plans to pay Daniel Vasella, its departing chairman, $78 million to prevent him from sharing knowledge with competitors.",6685428a-1770-5036-9544-3d1ecd137f54,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/19/business/19novartis-web/19novartis-web-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=314&w=600&s=6db840356530ed00be451ada58a5c2122ade6ebee3c2873b44b11ec79aa0d022&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Daniel Vasella, the departing chairman of Novartis.",6685428a-1770-5036-9544-3d1ecd137f54,N24News/imgs/6685428a-1770-5036-9544-3d1ecd137f54.jpg,24
Fashion & Style,"A Dating App, Not the Parents, Brought Them Together",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/16/fashion/weddings/a-dating-app-not-the-parents-brought-them-together.html,"When Jaspreet Kaur was a junior at Rider University in Lawrenceville, N.J., she and her best friend, Ndonga Sagnia, worked part time at the college help desk. Between fielding calls for technical help, they passed the time on Pinterest, making wedding boards. Though both were unattached 20-year-old accounting students at the time, Ms. Sagnia remembers Ms. Kaur outlining a few must-haves for her future wedding. ""She liked a lot of greenery, and there was this flower crown she wanted to wear that was really earthy and ethereal,"" said Ms. Sagnia, a certified public accountant in Harrison, N.J.

""Obviously I knew there were people out there who meet someone and fall in love and have a love marriage,"" said Ms. Kaur, whose parents immigrated from Punjab, India, in the 1980s and now live in Bordentown, N.J. But arranged marriages, from her perspective, can have a lot to offer. ""People think, why would you ever want your parents to choose your spouse,"" she said. ""But I say, Are you kidding me? If my parents are going to set me up with someone who's educated and stable and from a nice family, those are major boxes to check. I was definitely open to it.""

Mr. Mattson, 26 and a graduate student in physics at the University of Illinois, was climbing a mountain near Pennsylvania with a buddy in June 2015 when he saw that Ms. Kaur was his ""bagel of the day,"" the site's parlance for the person he was matched with and had 24 hours to pursue. ""I was checking my phone now and then, but I had no signal,"" he said. It was late in the day by the time he kicked the dirt off his boots and saw a picture of a wavy haired, big-smiling Indian woman on the app. ""I had to make a quick decision. I was like, yes, let's try this."" Days later, after a flurry of texts in which they found that Mr. Mattson's best friend since sixth grade, Corey Wu, was an accounting classmate of Ms. Kaur's at Rider, they met in Princeton, a town between their then-residences, his in Old Bridge and hers in Morristown. Coffee was the plan. But the parts of Mr. Mattson's profile that initially attracted Ms. Kaur, including his work at the time as a physics researcher at Rutgers University, proved worth exploring in a more in-depth way.

Most of the men she had been meeting online were not. ""I kept coming across finance bros; they're very into themselves,"" she said. The prospect of dating someone her parents selected -- someone Indian who practiced Sikhism, like them -- was on the back burner after a series of unsuccessful phone setups in her early 20s. ""It never got to an actual date,"" with suitors her parents chose, Ms. Kaur said. But if her parents were disappointed, they didn't let on. ""Of course they wanted it to work out, but I don't think they took it personally,"" she said. ""And they never made me feel like I was doing something wrong that was making it impossible to arrange my marriage. I think they realized that it's just not as easy as people think. Especially here in the U.S.""

Ms. Kaur was not thinking about marriage after her first few dates with Mr. Mattson. Too much was unsettled with him. He knew around the time of their first date that soon he would be applying to graduate schools. ""I didn't know where I'd end up,"" he said. ""We agreed early on, after two or three dates, that what we had was good, but that we weren't that serious yet, so we shouldn't start planning any big decisions around it."" Ms. Kaur accepted Mr. Mattson's imminent move without reservations. ""We were on the same page about it,"" she said. ""Like, let's just be honest with each other.""

Not that she hadn't daydreamed about moving far from New Jersey with Mr. Mattson. ""A lot of times when you're in an arranged marriage you don't meet someone from down the street, you end up moving,"" she said. Despite her closeness to her parents and extended family in New Jersey, ""I knew moving away would be a possibility if I went that route."" Moving for a love marriage would be the same: hard but doable. When Mr. Mattson was accepted to the University of Illinois and moved to Urbana in the fall of 2016, neither was ready to call the relationship quits, even temporarily.

""We were talking as much as possible,"" Mr. Mattson said. ""We found this app where we could log in and share a screen so we could watch movies together."" They also went on formal ""video dates."" ""We'd both pick up the same takeout and have dinner together, on our computers,"" Ms. Kaur said. ""Greg would wear a button-up and tie, and I would no longer be in sweatpants."" By the start of his second year in graduate school, Mr. Mattson was ready to propose. He had never met her family. (Both sets of parents declined to be named because of privacy concerns.)

Mr. Mattson knew Ms. Kaur's parents would likely not have included him on a shortlist of most eligible grooms. When Ms. Kaur arranged a Sunday brunch at her parents' house during Mr. Mattson's visit in October 2017, he was nervous. ""There was this layer of being nervous to meet your significant other's parents as a baseline. Then there was the whole other layer of the cultural issue,"" he said. ""I wasn't sure how forward-thinking her parents would be."" Ms. Kaur convinced him they would be welcoming. And they were. A few months later, Mr. Mattson whisked Ms. Kaur off to the Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Studios in Orlando. ""We're both big Harry Potter fans. It's one of the first things we talked about on the dating app, before we even exchanged numbers,"" Mr. Mattson said. On Jan. 3, after a full day at the amusement park during which he had to beg a security guard not to make him empty his pockets -- they contained a moissanite solitaire ring he bought in Chicago -- he proposed in the hotel room.

The 10-person bridal party, in long, autumn-inspired burgundy dresses, included Ms. Sagnia, and on the grooms' side, Mr. Wu. Ms. Kaur wore a traditional white wedding gown in an A-line shape with a lace, boat-neck top, Mr. Mattson a royal blue suit. About 90 guests lined the pews, some who had made the trip from India. The following morning, at the Central Jersey Sikh Association in Windsor, N.J., there was a ceremony led by a Granthi Balwinder Singh, who read from the Sikh holy book known as the Guru Granth Sahib. Ms. Kaur wore a beaded, shimmering lehngha -- a long, full skirt -- in cranberry and a matching peplum top custom-made in Patiala, India, by the same shop that made wedding dresses for her mother and several aunts decades ago. Mr. Mattson wore a traditional Sikh wedding sherwani in gold silk and a burgundy head scarf, and carried a kirpan, or sheathed sword, a Sikh tradition. About 200 guests, all shoeless and wearing head coverings, sat on a carpeted floor in the gurdwara, or marriage hall. After initial prayers, accompanied by three turbaned, heavily bearded granthis playing hand drums and harmonium, the granthi placed a scarf worn by Mr. Mattson in Ms. Kaur's hands. Bride and groom were then instructed to stand and circle the holy book a total of four times, with pauses to sit and pray between each round. Ten male relatives standing at intervals around the holy book were there to symbolically ""pass off"" Ms. Kaur to Mr. Mattson, and make it known that they will continue to nurture and protect her once she leaves home. After the holidays, Ms. Kaur will move to Illinois and start looking for accounting work. ""I'm really going to miss my family,"" she said. ""It's going to be different and it's going to be difficult."" But she is also sure that it will be worth it. ""I love Greg so much,"" she said at a reception held after the Sikh ceremony, at the Merion in Cinnaminson, N.J. She had removed the crown of flowers she wore at the Roman Catholic ceremony, and the baby's breath she wove into her hair at the Sikh ceremony. But she still looked ethereal.","""If my parents are going to set me up with someone who's educated and stable and from a nice family, those are major boxes to check.""",f5add672-d430-5843-8e2a-3be46228c484,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/18/style/18VOWS-9/18VOWS-9-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=95ab1eadba8729428edcdeb06f1b2b113d7808b292ffdf261faa0e54fbf534b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jaspreet Kaur and Gregory Mattson make an entrance during their reception at the Merion in Cinnaminson, N.J.

Technology,"Uber Posts Faster Growth, but Loses $1.1 Billion",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/technology/uber-growth-losses.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber capped a difficult 2019 by posting faster growth in its ride-hailing business, even as it lost more money.

On Thursday, Uber said its revenue in the fourth quarter of 2019 increased 37 percent to $4 billion from a year ago, faster than the 30 percent growth it recorded in the previous quarter. The company lost $1.1 billion, more than the $887 million it lost a year earlier.

""We recognize that the era of growth at all costs is over,"" said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive. ""I'm gratified by our progress, steadily delivering against the commitments we've made to our shareholders on our path to profitability.""

The results were driven by Uber's main ride-hailing business, with the number of trips rising 28 percent to more than 1.9 billion from a year earlier and revenue increasing 27 percent to more than $3 billion. In contrast, Uber's food delivery business, Uber Eats, lost $461 million on revenue of $734 million.","Uber's ride-hailing business grew faster in the fourth quarter of 2019, even as the company grappled with continued challenges.",4e9e2f4c-4994-5a4e-89cf-22adaad670ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/06/business/06uber/06uber-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4ff3ff68c6439f47154cc9f970a55f7a49b98a96a2edf4cb6b5dd8de368c6389&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Uber spends substantial sums to attract passengers and drivers.

Well,"CBD Is Everywhere, but Scientists Still Don't Know Much About It",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/25/well/live/cbd-cannabidiol-marijuana-medical-treatment-therapy.html,"CBD Is Everywhere, but Scientists Still Don't Know Much About It

Cannabidiol, or CBD, a nonintoxicating component of the marijuana plant, is touted as a magic bullet that eases pain, anxiety, insomnia and depression. Salves, sprays, tinctures and oils containing CBD are marketed as aphrodisiacs that boost desire; as balms for eczema, pimples and hot flashes; and even as treatments for serious diseases like diabetes and multiple sclerosis. Unlike THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, the ""psychoactive"" component of the cannabis plant, CBD won't get you ""high."" But scientists know little about what it can do: Most of the information about CBD's effects in humans is anecdotal or extrapolated from animal studies, and few rigorous trials have been conducted. ""It is a kind of a new snake oil in the sense that there are a lot of claims and not so much evidence,"" said Dustin Lee, an assistant professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who is planning a human trial of CBD for use in quitting smoking. The Food and Drug Administration has approved some drugs made from synthetic substances similar to THC to treat poor appetite and nausea in people with A.I.D.S. or canc er . But so far, the F.D.A. has approved only one drug containing CBD, Epidiolex, after clinical trials found it reduced seizures in children with two rare, severe forms of epilepsy.

""There's a lot of hype about everything about CBD,"" said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, the director of the NYU Langone Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, who led the Epidiolex studies and went out of his way to say the drug's effect was ""not miraculous."" ""There is certainly data that it has a variety of anti-inflammatory effects, but whether that translates into improving human health is unknown. Does it help people with eczema, rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis? We don't know. There is a good theoretical basis, but the studies have not been done."" The F.D.A. still considers CBD a drug, so it cannot be sold in foods or drinks or as a dietary supplement, and several states and cities -- including New York City, California, Maine and Ohio -- have ordered restaurants to remove CBD from lattes, smoothies, muffins and other foods. The F.D.A. has issued several warnings to companies that make unproven claims that their CBD products will treat or prevent disease. ""This deceptive marketing of unproven treatments raises significant public health concerns, as it may keep some patients from accessing appropriate, recognized therapies to treat serious and even fatal diseases,"" an F.D.A. spokesman said. Dr. Yasmin Hurd, director of the Addiction Institute at Mount Sinai in New York City and a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine who has done extensive research on CBD, says the compound holds particular potential for the opioid crisis because it appears to reduce heroin cravings in recovering addicts. But, she said, ""let's do the research. It's crazy that this substance is being consumed by everybody, yet we still don't know the mechanism of action."" CBD has a relatively good safety profile and is ""hands-down safer generally than THC,"" the intoxicating component of cannabis, Dr. Hurd said. But it can cause adverse side effects, including sleepiness and diarrhea. Patients in the Epidiolex trials also had more infections and rashes , as well as depressed appetite, sleep problems and elevated liver enzymes.

First isolated in 1940, CBD is one of more than 100 biologically active components called cannabinoids that are in the cannabis plant, and it is the second most abundant cannabinoid after THC. Scientists have long known CBD has anticonvulsant and anti-inflammatory effects, but it was not until recent years that CBD got more serious attention from researchers, who initially were more interested in studying cannabis's psychogenic components, like THC. ""You don't get a high from CBD no matter how much you take,"" said Sumner Burstein, a professor emeritus of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. It is also not addictive, but there is a possibility CBD will interact poorly or interfere with other medications, he said. Studies are now getting underway to evaluate whether CBD can alleviate anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder, or help with substance abuse and tobacco cessation. Leaf Vertical, a biopharmaceutical research company, will explore whether it can enhance cancer therapies. Animal studies suggest its anti-inflammatory effects may have benefits for helping to manage chronic pain or treat arthritis or inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn's disease. It is also being looked at for the treatment of autism . GW Pharmaceuticals, which makes Epidiolex, has a multiple sclerosis drug approved in the United Kingdom that combines CBD and THC, and the company is exploring the combination for other therapeutic applications. It is also studying other uses for CBD alone, including for Rett syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that has devastating neurologic consequences in young children. But the combination of CBD and THC may be more effective for some conditions than CBD alone, experts caution. While cannabis has shown promise for treating pain syndromes, for example, it is not clear that CBD alone will be an effective pain reliever. Several researchers said their interest in CBD was piqued by patient inquiries. So many people asked Dr. Michael Van Ameringen, director of an anxiety research center in Hamilton, Ontario, about CBD's therapeutic potential for anxiety that he decided to review the medical literature, and concluded that ""there actually really is very, very little scientific evidence to support its use as a treatment for anxiety at this point."" Some research has reported promising results in other psychiatric applications. Last year, for example, European scientists reported that patients with schizophrenia who were given 1,000 milligrams of CBD in addition to their regular antipsychotic medications experienced fewer hallucinations and racing thoughts compared with those on a placebo. But other studies of schizophrenia have not found the same benefits.

One Israeli trial found that people with Crohn's disease improved when they used cannabis, but a randomized controlled trial of CBD alone found no benefit for patients with treatment-resistant Crohn's, though investigators said the dose used may have been too low to be effective. Indeed, CBD research is at such an early stage that just figuring out the correct therapeutic dose to test is a challenge, scientists say. Scientists are anticipating easier access to the drug for research since a bill signed late last year removed hemp-derived products like CBD from the list of Schedule 1 controlled substan ce s , and allowed for the cultivation of hemp, which is defined as having less than 0.3 percent THC content. Before passage of that bill, CBD was considered part of the marijuana plant, and researchers in the U.S. were required to have a license in order to possess it, and had to obtain the product from a government-approved source and keep it under lock and key. Still, procuring high quality, uncontaminated CBD for research remains a daunting task, said Dr Lee. of Johns Hopkins. ""It might be available at the local 7-11 in Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. Lee ""but any product you get on the market is not federally regulated by the F.D.A, so the purity and safety and quality are questionable."" Indeed, a recent study that evaluated dozens of CBD products ordered online found that nearly 70 percent were not labeled accurately and had either higher or lower concentrations of the ingredient than indicated on the label. Some also contained THC. Dr. Hurd, who has been studying CBD for nearly 10 years, warns that the expectations around the substance are unrealistic. ""People are making it out to be a nirvana kind of drug, and that's a problem,"" she said. ""One compound cannot cure everything.""","""It is a kind of a new snake oil in the sense that there are a lot of claims and not so much evidence,"" said one expert.",6bb0695a-189b-5de4-ad37-d124d1f8a794,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/26/well/26-CBD/CBD-photo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d9cdfe33540b699a8e9ddeeec8dfb25812d5507febae17b43e1598e06b081a25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,CBD was offered at a Florida coffee shop in 2018.

Economy,Rationing Health Care More Fairly,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/22/business/economy/rationing-health-care-more-fairly.html,"Older adults are understandably anxious about the political sniping over the future financing of Medicare. That is precisely the intention of the presidential campaigns. Yet the cross-fire over who will cut Medicare by how much sidesteps a critical issue about the future of our medical care: If we must ration our care to hold down costs in the future, how can we do it in a fair, efficient and transparent way? Mitt Romney's campaign was brazenly misleading in its charge that the president's health plan would cut medical services to older adults by reducing Medicare spending by $716 billion. The president's savings will come mostly from smaller payments to managed care companies, which provide the same services as Medicare at a higher cost, and from slower growth in reimbursement rates to health care providers. But the response of President Obama's campaign also aimed to stoke voters' fears. It stressed -- rightly -- that the plan to curb Medicare costs proposed last year by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate, would add thousands of dollars to older Americans' out-of-pocket expenditures. Yet it ignored Mr. Ryan's recent efforts to soften the plan.

Both campaigns claim they are out to protect future health care. Yet the sniping hides the real issue. Protecting federal health programs over the long term, as the population ages and medical costs keep rising faster than economic growth, will require curbing the programs' spending. And we haven't quite figured out how to do that. The federal government's spending on health care consumes 4.8 percent of the nation's economic production and is expected to eat up 9.2 percent in 25 years, according to estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. A vast majority of economists agree that restoring a sustainable budget will mean either cuts in Medicare and Medicaid or a tax increase on the middle class. Decisions will have to be made about what services are not worth the cost. Yet so far, our political leaders have failed to acknowledge this to voters, offering instead an illusion that we can resolve the matter without any pain. Recall the political firestorm in 2009 when the Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women start regular screening for breast cancer at age 50 rather than 40. ""This is how rationing begins,"" said Representative Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican. ""This is when you start getting a bureaucrat between you and your physician."" The task force is an independent panel of experts financed by the Department of Health and Human Services. Doctors and private insurers usually follow its recommendations. Still, in 2010 -- after Mr. Obama's health reform legislation passed Congress -- the department said that insurers should ignore its latest findings and instead go back to its recommendation from 2002: that women start screening at 40.

Does it make sense that older adults in their last year of life consume more than a quarter of Medicare's expenditures, costing more than six times as much as other beneficiaries? Are there limits to what Medicare should spend on a therapy prolonging someone's life by a month or two? It's a tough political call. In light of the difficulties, our political leaders have preferred to punt on the issue, hoping it doesn't have to be decided on their watch. Instead, when they talk about health care, they call rationing by some other name. Rationing is inevitable in a world with finite resources. We do it in this country, too, and it is still one of the least fair and most inefficient rationing systems in the world. You get care if you have the money to pay for it; if not, you probably won't. The 30 percent of the population who are the heaviest users of health care account for nearly 89 percent of health care expenditures, according to a government study. But high-income Americans are more likely to see a doctor when they are sick, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. And the disparity between rich and poor is much higher than in other developed countries.

Meanwhile, tens of millions of Americans -- those whose employers don't provide health insurance, who are too poor to pay for it themselves and yet are too rich to use Medicaid -- get the least health care of all.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. A study of hospital emergency rooms in Wisconsin found that victims of severe traffic accidents without health insurance got 20 percent less care. Hospitals spent $3,300 more on average for each victim who was insured. They kept the insured 9.2 days, on average, and the uninsured just 6.4 days. Unsurprisingly, the uninsured were 40 percent more likely to die from their injuries.

Every health care proposal from the right and the left includes some form of implicit rationing device. Mr. Ryan's plan, on the Republican side, would keep spending on Medicare under 4.75 percent of the nation's output until 2050 by giving older adults born after 1958 a dollop of money to buy their own insurance, forcing many to choose cheaper plans or fewer procedures. The president's health care reform encourages rationing, too, by levying a tax on ""Cadillac"" insurance plans, and in turn pushing employers to seek cheaper options and lower costs. It creates an advisory board to cut costs from Medicare if spending rises above a set rate. And it finances an institute to evaluate which therapies are most clinically effective. Careful to avoid political blowback, the president's plan forbids Medicare to base its reimbursement decisions on the institute's findings. But neither initiative seems likely to solve our health care financing squeeze over the long term. The cuts proposed by Mr. Ryan -- shifting the risk of health care inflation onto the shoulders of older adults -- are certainly drastic. They also seem politically unfeasible. Under Mr. Ryan's most recent proposals, in 2030 Medicare would spend $2,200 less in today's money on each new enrollee than under the most likely outcome envisioned by the Congressional Budget Office based on current policies. By 2050, it would pay $8,000 less. Voters seem to think that might be too drastic a cut. The president's plan was more about offering health insurance to all, to end our Dickensian system of rationing by income, than long-term cost control. Savings mandated by the Affordable Care Act over the next 10 years will be difficult to maintain beyond that. It puts a lot of faith on eliminating waste, with potentially large savings. David Cutler, a health economist at Harvard, argues that a third of our health care dollars go to therapies that do not improve our health. A lot of that waste could be slashed simply by no longer paying providers a fee for each service, whether we need it or not, and paying them instead to keep us healthy. Going after waste seems sensible in a health care system that costs more than almost any other in the developed world, yet delivers lower-quality care. But savings from waste tend to be hard to achieve. Even with the Affordable Care Act in place, federal health spending will eat up almost twice as much of this nation's economic product in 2037 as it does today, according to the budget office. While it is reasonable for politicians to shy away from rationing -- especially when voters believe no expense should be spared to save a human life -- if the experience of other countries serves as precedent, they will probably get there sooner or later. In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence determines what therapies will be covered by the National Health Service. It generally recommends against paying for a therapy that costs more than $31,000 to $47,000 for each year of life gained, adjusted for quality.","The United States already rations health care, mostly by income level.

Movies,'1917' Was an Impossible Mission. Here's How Sam Mendes Pulled It Off.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/movies/1917-sam-mendes.html,"When the director Sam Mendes was a young boy, he and his father often traveled to the West Indies to visit his grandfather Alfred Mendes, a novelist. Sam, who had been brought up in North London, found his grandfather to be quite exotic: The small and wiry World War I veteran would sing opera in a booming Trinidadian accent, traipse around his creaky Colonial house in shorts and flip-flops and vigorously greet each morning with a pre-dawn plunge into the sea. Alfred Mendes also had a tendency to obsessively wash his hands, always for several minutes at a time, to the point where Sam and his cousins noticed that above all his other quirks. ""We would laugh at him,"" the director recalled, ""until I asked my dad, 'Why does Granddad Alfie wash his hands so much?' And he said, 'Oh, he remembers the mud of the trenches during the war, and the fact that he could never get clean.'"" That's when the boys stopped laughing at their grandfather. It's also when they began asking what happened when, at age 19, Alfred Mendes enlisted and fought on behalf of Britain in what would become one of the world's deadliest conflicts. ""We expected, I suppose, conventional stories of heroism and bravery,"" Mendes said. ""We certainly didn't expect what he told us, which was unbelievably shocking and quite graphic tales of utter futility and chaos.""

There was the wounded soldier his grandfather carried back to the trench under enemy fire, only to discover once he arrived that the man was dead, his body having absorbed a bullet meant for Alfred. Another story involved a German soldier whose head was lost in an explosion, though his body somehow carried on running. And then there was the mission that Alfred Mendes volunteered for on Oct. 12, 1917, after nearly a third of the men in his battalion had been killed in the Battle of Poelcappelle. The survivors were stranded across many miles, and Alfred, who had been trained as a signaler, was sent to rescue them and lead them back to his camp. ""That tiny man in the midst of that vast expanse of death, that was the thing I could never get out of my mind,"" said Mendes. It is the image that inspired the new film ""1917,"" directed and co-written by Mendes, about two British lance corporals who must make their way across miles of battleground to deliver an urgent message that could save 1,600 of their fellow soldiers from a massacre. Still, though the stories his grandfather told him had never been far from Mendes's mind, that didn't mean making a movie like this came easily. ""People say, 'Oh, you must've wanted to tell the story for years,' and actually, I didn't,"" said Mendes, 54, whose career has encompassed big-screen projects like ""American Beauty"" as well as a long list of stage credits, including ""The Ferryman"" and the 1990s revival of ""Cabaret.""

Mendes was also aware that while Hollywood has made many a World War II movie about hero soldiers fighting Nazis, the more muddled motivations and trench-warfare stalemates of the First World War would require a different kind of storytelling. ""That war was just a chaos of mismanagement and human tragedy on a vast scale,"" he said. ""You could kill someone at 1,000 yards with a machine gun, but you couldn't communicate with a soldier 20 yards away."" After directing the James Bond movies ""Skyfall"" and ""Spectre,"" Mendes was having trouble mounting a new film project. His agent Beth Swofford suggested that he explore the World War I stories he had once told her. In 2017, a year after the Brexit vote, Mendes found further inspiration. ""I'm afraid that the winds that were blowing before the First World War are blowing again,"" he said. ""There was this generation of men fighting then for a free and unified Europe, which we would do well to remember."" Once Mendes began mulling the screenplay with co-writer Krysty Wilson-Cairns, he quickly laid down three rules. Instead of adapting his grandfather's own story, Mendes would follow two relatively anonymous soldiers whose heroism would be accidental. The story would take place in the spring of 1917, when the Germans retreated to the Hindenburg Line and left a trail of devastation and traps in their wake. And there was one other artistic inspiration that would turn out to be the film's defining feature. Mendes wrote it on the screenplay's first page: ""1917"" would be presented as if it were all shot in one take.

""It was absolutely a given that was what excited me about it,"" said Mendes. ""There's a great danger that once you've got used to making films, you get lazy with the way you shoot them. 'Oh yeah, I know: close-up, over the shoulder, two-shot, moving shot, fancy shot every three scenes.' You can kind of read it in other people's movies."" But to film ""1917"" in robust long takes and to stitch those separate pieces together in nearly invisible ways would pose a unique challenge. ""For the first few scenes in the draft, I would feel like I was wearing a straitjacket,"" admitted Wilson-Cairns. ""It's a real bummer, the loss of moving around in time and space. But in exchange for that, you get to move around the film landscape the way we do in reality, and what that gives you as a writer is the ultimate ability to disappear.""

Mendes began filming ""1917"" in April of this year at Bovingdon Airfield in England. He was locked into a Christmas Day release, giving him an unusually short window to complete a film of this scale. And though Mendes had rehearsed the film extensively with his cast and assembled an Oscar-winning team of behind-the-scenes collaborators, including the cinematographer Roger Deakins and the editor Lee Smith, any little thing that went wrong during all of those long takes could scuttle the work of hundreds of people. ""There were times when I thought, 'I'm using every fiber of everything I know about theater and film combined,"" Mendes said. ""I was pushed to the limit to try and find solutions."" He didn't make it easy on himself. Though the shots were planned with the utmost precision, what happened within the frame was often subject to change depending on the weather, the ability of the actors to hit their marks in the mud, or how the more capricious members of the cast -- including several animals and a baby -- would react to the camera. When George MacKay, who plays one of the main characters, was accidentally knocked to the ground by another actor during a perilous sprint, Mendes kept it in the movie.

""I wanted to lock the audience in with the characters,"" said Mendes. ""The audience reacts to those scenes in a different way because they know they're not going to get out of it unless the men get out of it. You have a level of association that perhaps would not exist if we shot it conventionally."" Mendes finished the film a few days before Thanksgiving, and since then he has been on a whirlwind media tour meant to give ""1917"" a late award-season push. So far, so good: The Golden Globes nominated Mendes for best director and the film for best drama. Still, he has hardly had time to take a breath. ""I find talking about the movie is my gradual goodbye to it,"" he said. It's also a chance to reflect further on the grandfather who helped inspire it. Mendes recalled that when he was 12, Alfred Mendes asked him to sign a contract the older man had written out by hand, in which the young boy promised he would write his first novel by the age of 18. ""He told me, 'You're going to tell stories. This is what you have to do.'"" Still, Alfred Mendes could hardly have imagined that one day, that grandson would go on to tell a story drawn so vividly from the tales he spun in that great drafty house in the West Indies. Now, with ""1917"" finally complete, Mendes is reminded of the quote from the philosopher Albert Camus, that ""a man's work is nothing but this slow trek to rediscover, through the detours of art, those two or three great and simple images in whose presence his heart first opened."" ""And I think that is true of those stories,"" Mendes said. ""I think, for whatever reason, my heart first opened in those moments.""","The World War I drama, seemingly filmed in one bravura take, is a tribute to his grandfather that Mendes never thought he'd make.",439bcb9b-4e0e-58c8-b1ac-5e71f3601cf2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/23/arts/23mendes-1917-hppromo/23mendes-1917-hppromo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a859e835caa50bcb7a868097ff4372efefe2d0b5f81ce2addf8bb863cc1da079&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sam Mendes directs Dean-Charles Chapman, left, and George MacKay on the set of ""1917.""",439bcb9b-4e0e-58c8-b1ac-5e71f3601cf2,N24News/imgs/439bcb9b-4e0e-58c8-b1ac-5e71f3601cf2.jpg,5
Health,W.H.O. Clarifies Advice on Sex and Pregnancy in Zika Regions,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/07/health/who-zika-sexual-transmission-pregnancy.html,"The World Health Organization on Tuesday clarified -- once again -- its advice on sexual transmission of the Zika virus, saying that couples living in areas where it is circulating should be offered contraception and counseling to help decide whether to become pregnant.

A spokeswoman said the agency made the announcement to clear up earlier confusion over whether it was advising women to avoid pregnancy during the epidemic. The W.H.O. is not offering such advice, although, she conceded, officials did appear to have said as much in June.

The W.H.O. also suggested that men and women who visit and return from areas with mosquito-borne Zika transmission practice protected sex or abstinence for six months. The advice to wait that long -- instead of eight weeks, the previous limit -- is based on new evidence about the persistence of the virus in semen.

Two men in Italy who had visited Haiti in January and February were recently found to have viral RNA in their semen six months later. Researchers were unable to grow live virus from the samples, however, so it remained unclear whether they were infectious for that long.","A spokeswoman said, ""We want it to be unmistakable that we are not counseling anybody toward delay.""",386c5bd5-bcba-5ee9-8358-cfb417430fbd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/07/science/07ZIKA/07ZIKA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3455e935dcee704d20361a7ea257aa2212683e5109eef866d961069eb1f30e0a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Condoms and literature on the prevention of the Zika virus and other diseases were handed out on Aug. 31 by health clinic workers in Loiza, Puerto Rico, to fight a spreading epidemic.",386c5bd5-bcba-5ee9-8358-cfb417430fbd,N24News/imgs/386c5bd5-bcba-5ee9-8358-cfb417430fbd.jpg,1

Results from the trial, which is overseen by the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease and UCL (formerly the University College London), were released at a conference in Mexico. The trial includes 424 patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis in Ethiopia, Mongolia, South Africa and Vietnam.

There were ""favorable outcomes"" in about 78 percent of those treated for nine months, the authors said -- close to the 81 percent success rate observed in clinical trials using the two-year regimen.

Movies,'Gone With the Wind' and Controversy: What You Need to Know,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/movies/gone-with-the-wind-controversy.html,"In fact, ""Gone With the Wind"" is no stranger to controversy. Here's a quick explainer.

I've never seen the movie. What's the story?

As with Mitchell's best-selling novel, ""Gone With the Wind"" is set on a Georgia plantation during and after the Civil War. The protagonist is Scarlett O'Hara (Viven Leigh), headstrong daughter of the plantation owner, and the primary focus of the narrative is her romantic exploits. But a fair amount of the film's leisurely 221-minute running time is spent on the struggle to keep the plantation afloat, and on Scarlett's relationships with the family's slaves, including Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), Pork (Oscar Polk) and Mammy (Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for her performance -- the first African-American so honored).

What do critics object to?

As Ridley notes, the primary point of contention is the film's romanticizing of the antebellum South, and its whitewashing of the horrors of slavery. The film presents the region's pre-Civil War era as a utopia of tranquil living, and the Northern forces as interlopers, trying to disrupt that way of life. The servant characters are written and played as docile and content, more dedicated to their white masters than to the struggle of their fellow enslaved people (and uninterested in leaving the plantation after the war). And, much like D.W. Griffith's horrifying hit ""The Birth of a Nation,"" the film casts the freed slaves of the Reconstruction era as morally dangerous and politically naive.

How was it received when it was released?

Most critics joined in a chorus of praise, and moviegoers flocked to theaters. It remains the top-grossing film of all time, when adjusted for ticket price inflation. The academy was also impressed, giving it 10 Oscars, including best picture, best actress, best director (Victor Fleming) and, of course, McDaniel's statuette.

So nobody objected in 1939?

Right-leaning pundits have already branded HBO Max's removal as yet another example of contemporary ""woke""-ism run amok, but ""Gone With the Wind"" has been the object of controversy since its inception. As detailed by Leonard J. Leff in The Atlantic, several groups sent letters to the producer, David O. Selznick, while the film was in preproduction, flagging their concerns with Mitchell's novel, including its frequent use of racist slurs and characterization of the Ku Klux Klan as a ""tragic necessity."" The Los Angeles Sentinel called for a boycott of ""every other Selznick picture, present and future.""

Under that pressure, Selznick and his screenwriter, Sidney Howard, ultimately softened some of those elements, and agreed to the N.A.A.C.P.'s suggestion of hiring a technical adviser ""to watch the entire treatment of the Negroes."" In fact, he hired two -- both of them white.","HBO Max has temporarily pulled the film from its streaming service after the filmmaker John Ridley called out its ""painful stereotypes of people of color.""",444fe83f-c189-54e0-9295-4c3cf0a49edf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/10/arts/10gwtw-explainer1/10gwtw-explainer1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fa45901202a38f2cedb83fa2268924844ddb438c0ebbafeda5a086e0ba78ba81&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Hattie McDaniel, Olivia de Havilland and Vivien Leigh in ""Gone With the Wind.""",444fe83f-c189-54e0-9295-4c3cf0a49edf,N24News/imgs/444fe83f-c189-54e0-9295-4c3cf0a49edf.jpg,5
Theater,"'Girl From the North Country,' With Bob Dylan Songs, Is Bound for Broadway",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/theater/girl-north-country-dylan-mcpherson-broadway.html,"""Girl From the North Country,"" a musical that uses the songs of Bob Dylan to illuminate the heartache and hard times facing Depression-era denizens of a Midwestern boardinghouse, is coming to Broadway.

The show is written and directed by Conor McPherson, an Irish playwright who has had three previous plays on Broadway, ""The Weir,"" ""Shining City"" and ""The Seafarer."" It is scheduled to begin performances Feb. 7 and to open March 5 at the Belasco Theater.

Set in Duluth, Minn., in 1934 -- seven years before Mr. Dylan was born there -- the show is a work of fiction that explores the themes and ideas suggested by the songwriter's music.

""It's about how people are trying to deal with being alive in the world, and struggling to fulfill their dreams, and it invites the bigger questions -- the stuff of plays and art and songs,"" Mr. McPherson said. ""And it feels like a lot of the uncertainties of the 1930s seem to be back -- the sense of destabilization that was around then, where people feel a little unsafe.

Music,An Opera Worth Fighting Over,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/13/arts/music/rameau-hippolyte-juilliard.html,"Opera is a pretty placid universe these days. So it's hard to imagine a premiere that could single-handedly divide the music-loving public in two, separating it into factions with positions as hotly held as those of today's Democrats and Republicans. Rameau's ""Hippolyte et Aricie"" had just such an impact on France when it opened at the Paris Opera in 1733. It will be presented in a new, eagerly anticipated production on April 17, 19 and 21 at the Juilliard School, which has become an early music powerhouse over the past decade. ""Hippolyte"" was Rameau's first opera, but it is not at all the product of a novice. Nearly 50 when he wrote it, already a master of the harpsichord and the author of a groundbreaking treatise on harmony, he had thought long and hard about the task, and probably knew the controversy he would be stirring.

The public separated into ""lullistes"" and ""ramistes"" (or, in an echo of the French word for chimney sweep, ""ramoneurs""). The conflict raged for years as Rameau produced masterpiece after masterpiece. Cuts and other alterations were made to bring ""Hippolyte"" closer to what was expected. But Stephen Stubbs, the conductor of the Juilliard production and an artistic director of the Boston Early Music Festival, said the original 1733 version ""represents Rameau's undigested thoughts about what opera should be."" This is essentially the version Juilliard will perform, in a rare New York performance of one of Rameau's unforgettably grand ""tragedies en musique."" ""'Hippolyte' is sort of mind-blowing in the sheer quantity of its creative ideas and even the quantity of notes,"" Mr. Stubbs said in an interview. As the composer Andre Campra, Rameau's contemporary, observed, ""There is enough material in this opera to make 10 of them.""

Typically rooted in mythology, the librettos of ""tragedies en musique"" were crucial; the name of the genre emphasizes the texts as much as the sounds. That of ""Hippolyte"" is no exception. But in addition to classical sources -- Euripides and Seneca -- the librettist, Simon-Joseph Pellegrin, turned to Racine's revered ""Phedre."" ""This is one of the greatest plays in the French language, and its force can be felt in the opera,"" Stephen Wadsworth, the director, said in an email. A prologue and five acts is the norm for these operas -- Juilliard omits the prologue, in accordance with later practice during Rameau's day -- with each act consisting of dialogue scenes and a divertissement. The dialogue scenes advance the action through a fluent mix of recitative and (usually short) airs or duets. The divertissements, consisting of dances, choruses and solo songs, provide entertainment yet often relate meaningfully to the action. ""The jump-cutting from earthy dance music to complicated tragic introspection and back gives this piece its own, compelling character,"" Mr. Wadsworth said. Zack Winokur, the choreographer of the Juilliard staging, said the production sometimes blurs the distinction between the scenes and the divertissements (which will be trimmed) in favor of ""a single storytelling mechanism.""

The opera's title couple are the picture of pastoral innocence. Aricie, the daughter of a vanquished enemy of the Athenian king, Thesee, has been ordered to become a priestess of the goddess Diana; her lover Hippolyte, Thesee's son, vows to liberate her. But they become caught in a tragedy precipitated by an older, more decadent couple: Thesee and his wife, Phedre, Hippolyte's stepmother, who suffers from an unquenchable love for Hippolyte. Act I opens with an exquisite da capo air in which Aricie, not yet aware Hippolyte reciprocates her love, contemplates the repose that serving Diana will bring her. But shifting harmonies in the middle section signify that her love for Hippolyte endures.

In a brief air, he furiously calls on the gods to rain down thunderbolts. With a shift back to recitative, Phedre realizes her situation is hopeless and urges Hippolyte to kill her, before seizing his sword herself. Hippolyte retrieves it just as Thesee appears to witness his son threatening his wife. Phedre departs with Hippolyte, who hides the truth out of filial respect, leaving Phedre's confidante, Oenone, to insinuate to the devastated Thesee that Hippolyte did indeed seek to harm Phedre. Festive music is suddenly heard as the people celebrate Thesee's safe return in an ironic divertissement. Thesee rashly concludes his son is guilty and again invokes Neptune, this time to punish Hippolyte. In Act IV, set near the seashore, Hippolyte persuades Aricie to accompany him into exile. A group of hunters precipitates the act's divertissement, which is cut short by the appearance of a sea monster. Winds and the ocean are evoked, this time with the participation of terrified voices.

Why are operas like ""Hippolyte"" so rarely encountered? Nearly 30 years ago, William Christie and his ensemble, Les Arts Florissants, began a revelatory series of ""tragedies en musique"" productions that toured internationally, including several stagings at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. These presentations, including ""Hippolyte,"" proved the works' ability to speak to modern audiences. But, as Mr. Wadsworth noted: ""This is pricey stuff. The form is scaled large, often with different locations, and it is challenging dramaturgically, requiring integrated action among principals, chorus and dancers -- much more challenging than a Handel opera."" Happily, Juilliard has taken up the challenge.","Listen to Rameau's rarely performed ""Hippolyte et Aricie""",6ed931ac-7a95-564b-aedf-e78208398ab0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/arts/15RAMEAUh/15RAMEAUh-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=73e07ed6b1f2e55f3ff2e490380b58f3bc5174f1647efc1a05b73507d7c437f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Zack Winokur, center, the Juilliard production's choreographer, demonstrating for Alex Rosen, who plays Thésée.",6ed931ac-7a95-564b-aedf-e78208398ab0,N24News/imgs/6ed931ac-7a95-564b-aedf-e78208398ab0.jpg,12

On a recent Sunday in the heart of Beverly Hills, Calif., the hordes were ready. About 300 people began circling waiters armed with tubes of Pringles and mini-croissants. Trays of finger sandwiches (peanut butter, honey and banana) were in ready supply. Attendees stood about 15 deep in lines as seven bartenders frantically handed out free booze. ""Can you believe this?"" said Nicole Leanne Nelson, an actress, holding a glass of red wine. The lavish spread was courtesy of Netflix, which was promoting its rookie drama ""Stranger Things"" to a pool of invite-only guests it hoped -- but did not know for sure -- included Emmy voters. It was just one of about two dozen events that the company had thrown in a rented event space over five weeks, each trying to inspire potential voters to nominate Netflix's original content for the Emmy Awards.

""I'll put a number on it -- it's 10 times crazier,"" FX's chief executive, John Landgraf, said, laughing. ""It's ridiculous."" At a time when there is more television than ever -- there will be more than 450 scripted shows broadcast this year -- award jockeying, apparently, is the next logical step. Voting for nominations began last week. Nominees for the September ceremony will be announced next month. The Oscars may have some restrictions on what studios can do to influence would-be voters, but the Emmys hunt has turned into a Wild West of no-holds barred campaigning.

""For Your Consideration"" advertisements have blanketed Los Angeles, appearing on billboards, bus shelters and posters. In a seven-block stretch of Melrose Avenue, there were outdoor ads for ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" (Netflix), ""Sarah Silverman: A Speck of Dust"" (Netflix), ""Transparent"" (Amazon), ""The Night Of"" (HBO), ""The Good Fight"" (CBS) and ""Superstore"" (NBC). ""I live in Studio City and drive all the way across town to our office, and I pass at least three 'Legion' billboards,"" said John Cameron, an executive producer for FX's ""Legion"" and ""Fargo."" ""We're not even on the air anymore and they're up for that very reason: for Emmy voter memory reasons.""

Mr. Cameron was an executive producer of the critical hit ""Friday Night Lights"" and reflected on what it was like in the old days -- that is, about six years ago. ""They never used to bother to advertise television like that,"" he said. ""Now it's completely analogous to an Oscars campaign."" Each day for the past couple of months, thousands of Emmy voters have received mailed packages filled with elaborately designed boxes that contain DVDs for award contenders. The packages are a considerable expense -- the more ostentatious, the more likely to stand out -- and are mailed to a large number of potential voters. Executives estimate that the packages cost some networks more than $1 million, and for a select few, over $2 million.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""It is overwhelming the amount of content that comes to me every single day,"" said Warren Littlefield, the head of NBC's entertainment division in the 1990s, and an executive producer for several Emmy contenders, including ""The Handmaid's Tale.""

Industry executives concede that the majority of those discs will most likely not be watched, and that there is something anachronistic about sending DVDs in the streaming era. But if one network sends out big packages, others feel compelled to join in. Emmy campaigning has escalated this year in part because of the swelling number of TV shows and the large group of voters that executives are trying to reach. The Television Academy voting pool has more than 22,000 people, dwarfing the roughly 7,000 members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that vote for the Oscars. ""There are more voting members of the TV academy than voted for mayor of Los Angeles,"" joked Tony Angellotti, a longtime Oscars awards strategist who is working with the cable network Starz this year. There are beneficiaries of all this campaigning, of course. Emmy-related advertising is up about 20 percent at The Hollywood Reporter this year, said Lynne Segall, the trade publication's executive vice president and publisher. She also noted that television's awards season was inherently frenetic because it lasts only from April to June, which is shorter than the period for movie awards.

For years, the Television Academy has facilitated ""For Your Consideration"" events between April and June. A typical event includes a panel discussion with actors and writers discussing the past season of a contending TV show. That's usually followed by a party with an open bar and dinner. (Several executives noted that they were certain many Academy members were showing up for little more than a free meal.) The issue has long been one of scarcity: the academy organizes a calendar that allows one network a day to stage an event in Los Angeles, and occasionally another event in New York on the same night. Over that two-month stretch, a studio is unlikely to get more than three or four slots in which to showcase its candidates. Netflix had a few slots on the sanctioned calendar but elected to rent out a 24,000-square-foot multilevel space in Beverly Hills to stage competing events, cheekily calling them FYSee. Rivals grumbled that the events, which ended once voting started last week, violated a tacit agreement among networks to mostly stick with the official calendar. For instance, when FX convened its sanctioned event for ""The Americans"" in Hollywood on June 1, Netflix staged an unofficial event across town for ""Master of None."" ""We consider Netflix a home for the industry's most compelling storytellers and are responsible for finding equally innovative ways to present their stories,"" said Cindy Holland, Netflix's vice president of original content. In addition to a stage and seating area for panels, the Netflix space featured lavish exhibits dedicated to its shows.

The ""Stranger Things"" area was accessible through a wall of mist, where the show's logo was projected. A room for ""The Crown"" had formal dinnerware (crystal goblets, china) hanging from the ceiling. Even the canceled series ""The Get Down,"" which was set in the 1970s, had a display involving 50 disco balls and a dozen boomboxes. Netflix was missing just one thing: the definitive list of Emmy voters, controlled solely by the Television Academy. The company sent out invites by stringing together various lists from several guilds, hoping that there would be enough overlap. Ms. Nelson, the actress roaming the space, said that while she was a member of the Screen Actors Guild she was not, in fact, an Emmys voter. The question in the industry is whether the Netflix event space -- and Amazon's smaller events -- would spur copycats. ""I kind of doubt that there's an Emmy voter who is going to vote for a show because you bought them a cheeseburger,"" said Mr. Landgraf, the FX executive. ""I have more faith in the electorate than that. I think they'll vote for the shows that they think are the best."" This year, at least, the industry is not leaving that to chance.","Encouraged by streaming services like Netflix, networks are spending heavily to get their shows noticed by prospective Emmy voters.",ff321577-184c-5066-b9c4-11a41cfdb77d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/20/arts/20emmys3/20emmys3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=55fc897774b11036eb6fb9fa5b71f52bce092053d897e5aa7449ab87ae177afe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An installation by Netflix at an event space in Beverly Hills, Calif., for ""Stranger Things"" is intended to inspire potential voters to nominate the show for Emmy awards.",ff321577-184c-5066-b9c4-11a41cfdb77d,N24News/imgs/ff321577-184c-5066-b9c4-11a41cfdb77d.jpg,16

Before then, we're getting prepared by rewatching the first seven seasons. Sign up to get these straight to your inbox. This article contains spoilers for Seasons 1-7 of ""Game of Thrones."" It's 10 p.m. -- do you know where your dragons are? If not, we're here to help, as we wrap up Season 2 in our great rewatch. If you missed the first Season 2 installment on Monday, it's available here. If you have any burning questions you would like answered, send them to gameofthrones@nytimes.com. Who Played the Game Best?

Just as in our world, the tension between competing forms of mysticism and skepticism is a defining feature of ""Game of Thrones."" It is also a prominent theme of Season 2, beginning with the red comet that streaks through the sky in the first episode. The men in the North see it as a sign that Robb Stark will win the war. Others see it as a sign that the Lannisters will rule the Seven Kingdoms. Osha tells Bran of the latest hot takes before concluding, ""Stars don't fall for men. The red comet means one thing, boy: dragons."" It's possible. Or a comet could be just a comet. Everyone is certain that their interpretation is correct, just as they're certain that their god or gods are the right ones. As the pirate Salladhor Saan says: ""I've been all over the world, my boy, and everywhere I go, people tell me about the 'true god.' They all think they've found the right one.""

Maester Luwin says that magic might have once been a mighty force, but not anymore: ""The dragons are gone, the giants are dead and the Children of the Forest forgotten."" But we've seen the dragons hatch, and we know that not everything that was thought to be extinct is really gone. Pyat Pree claims that magic has grown stronger in the world since the birth of Dany's dragons. Bran has prophetic dreams. ""My dreams are different,"" he insists. ""Mine are true."" Dany has prophetic dreams, too. ""I'm no ordinary woman,"" she insists. ""My dreams come true."" Like horoscopes, the dreams are easier to read in hindsight. Bran's vision of a sea coming to Winterfell and drowned men floating in the yard -- of course that's Theon Greyjoy's takeover! Dany's vision of snow (Snow?) on the Iron Throne in the House of the Undying? It could be a trick, a temptation -- we won't know if it's actually a prediction until, presumably, we learn how this story ends. And then we have this story's most self-aggrandizing seer: Melisandre. She tells of a prophecy regarding her god and a reincarnated hero known as the Prince (or Princess) that was Promised, who had been sent to vanquish the Great Other.

Some of that seems to be coming true. She tells Stannis that he is the Lord's chosen, and they base their battle strategies on this assumption. While Melisandre repeatedly demonstrates her magical abilities -- She can look younger and prettier! She can birth shadow babies! She can resurrect the dead! -- performing magic and reading prophecies are different powers. Besides, her actual intentions aren't entirely clear. She insists that Stannis will be king, but the more interesting prediction comes when she tells him that he will betray everything he once held dear. Is that really prophecy, or is she priming him with the power of suggestion? Much of what Melisandre does with Stannis is psychology and seduction, not magic. Even if we take what she says at face value, her beliefs don't line up with those of the Red Temple priests and priestesses we meet later -- they believe Dany is the Chosen One. Not Jon. And certainly not Stannis. So did Melisandre truly believe Stannis was the Chosen One and flock to his side? Or did she sell him on that idea solely out of self-interest, perhaps hoping he would make the Red Temple's faith the state religion of Westeros? (It's hard to turn down a belief system in which you're the messiah). But shouldn't a fabled hero be able to draw his burning sword from the fire on his own, without a priestess essentially handing it to him?

Fans love to try to decode these visions and prophecies, but we should be wary not to repeat Melisandre's mistakes. Prophecies are like propaganda -- they can be useful for propping someone up but they rarely tell the whole story, and believing in them can ensure your doom. In an interview seven years ago, George R.R. Martin addressed the traditional audience expectation that the hero ""is the chosen one, and he is always protected by his destiny."" Martin said he didn't want that to be the case in A Song of Ice and Fire. Or, as Tyrion says in the books, ""Prophecy is like a half-trained mule. It looks as though it might be useful, but the moment you trust in it, it kicks you in the head."" Stannis, your prophecy awaits you. Believe at your own risk. A Few Words from the Departed

Many characters in ""Game of Thrones"" live and die by the sword, but few expect to be stabbed in the heart by a magical shadow. We talked to the actor Gethin Anthony about King Renly's abbreviated reign in Season 2. (Adapted from an interview for an earlier article.) How did you find out about your character's death? While auditioning, I read the first and most of the second book. By the time I was called in to read for Renly, I was well aware of his grisly demise. It made the process feel more like a movie for me. I knew his beginning, middle and tragic end before stepping on set. It clarified in my mind what my approach should be. Did you read any of the fan reaction? I've heard some very nice things said about Renly. Whatever you can say about his naivete in dealing with Stannis and Melisandre, he had a good heart. People have told me they miss the character, which is just lovely.

I think they miss seeing Renly and Loras together as well. I feel like it could be a whole spinoff! As preparation for Season 2, I wrote a little fan fiction for myself about Renly, Loras and the marriage of Margaery. I had all these visuals in my head for the end of Season 1, beginning of Season 2: What they did between the seasons. The nights they stole away together -- on the wedding night, Renly and Loras just went off to be by a lake under the trees. How did you feel about Brienne avenging Renly? Finally! She took some time. Watching Brienne kick ass with Stannis was a good thing. But Melisandre ... She's become this huge presence, this darkness in the show, and Brienne needs to sort it out. I think Melisandre represents the corruption that power brings. It's quite hard to fight these fantastical, supernatural forces. Keep training, keep up the sword fighting, but ultimately, get a powerful ally. What do you remember from your last day on set? We were doing a quick shot in Renly's camp on the beach at night with the wind blowing and huge lighting setups. Seeing all those hundreds of people working in these epic circumstances as I got to say goodbye really brought home what a privilege it was to be a part of this huge endeavor. Who had your favorite death and why? Viserys. I always thought the symbolism of him being burned to death with the gold he so coveted was a brilliant representation of what the books and the show were about. Where Are They Now?

It also changed the reason Robb Stark throws away his alliance with the Freys, which, as we know, leads to all sorts of trouble for him and others. In ""A Clash of Kings,"" a wounded Robb learns of Theon's purported execution of his younger brothers Bran and Rickon. In his anguish, Robb receives ""comfort"" (i.e. sex) from the young noblewoman tending his wounds at the castle he just conquered. This is perhaps an understandable lapse in judgment, because of his youth (he's even younger in the books), his grief and his state of mind (he's feverish and might have been given milk of the poppy). The problem is, Jeyne's not a prostitute or a commoner -- she's a lord's daughter. So Robb is honor-bound to marry her. Robb faces an ethical dilemma. This is not a dating game, choosing between the possibly ugly Frey behind door No. 1 and the winsome Westerling behind door No. 2. It's actually a choice between protecting his own honor or protecting someone else's. Since he's Ned Stark's son, he tries to protect someone else, even though it could end in misery. And sure enough, book-Robb makes a tragic mistake that leads to many deaths, including his own. TV Robb isn't facing an ethical dilemma -- he's disregarding honor entirely. He actively pursues this young woman, whom he finds beautiful and intriguing, even though he's already committed to an arranged marriage. He chooses to spend time with her when he could be sorting out troop movements, perusing battle plans or seeking counsel from his top lieutenant (a slight that Roose Bolton doesn't forget, and which leads to his participation in the Red Wedding). Even after Catelyn warns her son away from battlefield hookups when he's betrothed to another, Robb continues flirting with Talisa. Because this is all presented as a love story, we're supposed to root for the young lovers. And isn't Talisa a great catch -- smart, sassy, good with amputations? Best of all, she's not taking sides in this ugly war. In the books, Robb's marriage to Jeyne was a little more suspicious -- and, quite possibly, a setup. The Westerlings may not have been privy to the entirety of the Red Wedding plans, but they had some sort of an ""understanding"" with Tywin, which included making sure Robb did not conceive an heir with his new bride. Jeyne never got pregnant, did not attend the massacre and is still alive.

Knowing the extent of the Westerling conspiracy to undermine and destroy the Starks, some book readers were understandably confused by the show's name-and-character swap between Jeyne and Talisa and the large deviation from the book plot. It didn't help that the character was originally listed as ""Jeyne Westerling,"" until George R.R. Martin suggested to the showrunners that if they were going to change Robb's wife's back story to make her a citizen from Volantis, they should also give her a Volantene name. (Thus: ""Talisa Maegyr."") Conspiracy theories naturally arose that Talisa must be a Lannister loyalist posing as a Volantene noblewoman, and had been sent to seduce Robb and spy on him -- in other words, she was still Jeyne, but with the rest of the Westerlings excised. After all, she keeps writing all these letters! This honey pot theory was debated throughout Seasons 2 and 3, and the issue wasn't settled until her death at the Red Wedding. It's possible the showrunners did intend this character to be a spy at one point, but then decided that would make the story too complicated. Or maybe they just wanted a simple, tragic love story. How Did You Get Your 'Game' On? In our last installment, we asked if you had any burning questions -- and boy, did you! Two readers asked related questions, which we've lighted edited for clarity: ""Why did Littlefinger have Lysa kill her husband? What did Littlefinger have to gain in his death other than causing lots of chaos?"" -- Teresa Prather Control. Instead of allowing Jon Arryn to run to King Robert with the twincest news, Petyr Baelish can manipulate the release of this valuable information, to his own benefit. Knocking Arryn off the board also creates two vacancies: Hand of the King and Lord of the Vale. Hand of the King, he can predict, will be filled by the more gullible Ned Stark (whose wife he's long desired). Leadership of the Vale would fall to Lysa (who is already in his thrall). Blaming the Lannisters for the murder sets them against the biggest power block (Houses Arryn, Tully, Stark and Baratheon), creating a feud in which he could play both sides. Even if one of Littlefinger's goals was lots of chaos, it's chaos with predictable outcomes -- a new king, hopefully one he can pick, and some lands and titles (and their attendant wealth) from whichever side wins. Plus the pleasure of pulling all the strings.","We continue our grand rewatch with a breakdown of Season 2's many prophesies, winners and losers.",d4048731-7b6b-5f9d-99c7-6be206a548f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/08/arts/08THRONESNL-1/08THRONESNL-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=b8aebe9be96890007f204275116d8710a8c52d17007078380aac1ca4a3156ea6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Natalie Dormer as Margaery Tyrell in ""Game of Thrones.""",d4048731-7b6b-5f9d-99c7-6be206a548f6,N24News/imgs/d4048731-7b6b-5f9d-99c7-6be206a548f6.jpg,3
Health,Scientists Move Closer to Understanding Schizophrenia's Cause,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/28/health/schizophrenia-cause-synaptic-pruning-brain-psychiatry.html,"Scientists reported on Wednesday that they had taken a significant step toward understanding the cause of schizophrenia, in a landmark study that provides the first rigorously tested insight into the biology behind any common psychiatric disorder. More than two million Americans have a diagnosis of schizophrenia, which is characterized by delusional thinking and hallucinations. The drugs available to treat it blunt some of its symptoms but do not touch the underlying cause. The finding, published in the journal Nature, will not lead to new treatments soon, experts said, nor to widely available testing for individual risk. But the results provide researchers with their first biological handle on an ancient disorder whose cause has confounded modern science for generations. The finding also helps explain some other mysteries, including why the disorder often begins in adolescence or young adulthood. ""They did a phenomenal job,"" said David B. Goldstein, a professor of genetics at Columbia University who has been critical of previous large-scale projects focused on the genetics of psychiatric disorders. ""This paper gives us a foothold, something we can work on, and that's what we've been looking for now, for a long, long time.""

The researchers pieced together the steps by which genes can increase a person's risk of developing schizophrenia. That risk, they found, is tied to a natural process called synaptic pruning, in which the brain sheds weak or redundant connections between neurons as it matures. During adolescence and early adulthood, this activity takes place primarily in the section of the brain where thinking and planning skills are centered, known as the prefrontal cortex. People who carry genes that accelerate or intensify that pruning are at higher risk of developing schizophrenia than those who do not, the new study suggests.

Some researchers had suspected that the pruning must somehow go awry in people with schizophrenia, because previous studies showed that their prefrontal areas tended to have a diminished number of neural connections, compared with those of unaffected people. The new paper not only strongly supports that this is the case, but also describes how the pruning probably goes wrong and why, and identifies the genes responsible: People with schizophrenia have a gene variant that apparently facilitates aggressive ""tagging"" of connections for pruning, in effect accelerating the process. Some scientists warned that the history of biological psychiatry stands as a caution against premature optimism. ""This work is extremely persuasive,"" said Dr. Samuel Barondes, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, ""but any step forward is not only rare and unusual, it's just one step in a journey of a thousand miles"" to improved treatments. The study, by scientists from Harvard Medical School, Boston Children's Hospital and the Broad Institute, a research center allied with Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, provides a showcase of biomedical investigation at its highest level. The research team began by focusing on a location on the human genome, the MHC, which was most strongly associated with schizophrenia in previous genetic studies. On a bar graph -- called a Manhattan plot because it looks like a cluster of skyscrapers -- the MHC looms highest.

""The MHC is the Freedom Tower"" of the Manhattan plot, said Eric S. Lander, the director of the Broad Institute. ""The question was, what's in there?"" The area is a notoriously dark warren in the genome known to contain genes that facilitate the body's immune response, for example, by flagging invading bacteria to be destroyed. That property had given rise to speculation that schizophrenia might be a kind of autoimmune condition, in which the body attacked its own cells. But the research team, led by Steven McCarroll, an associate professor of genetics at Harvard, and by Aswin Sekar, one of his graduate students, found something different. Using advanced statistical methods, the team found that the MHC locus contained four common variants of a gene called C4, and that those variants produced two kinds of proteins, C4-A and C4-B. The team analyzed the genomes of more than 64,000 people and found that people with schizophrenia were more likely to have the overactive forms of C4-A than control subjects. ""C4-A seemed to be the gene driving risk for schizophrenia,"" Dr. McCarroll said, ""but we had to be sure.""

The researchers turned to Beth Stevens, an assistant professor of neurology at Boston Children's Hospital and Harvard, who was an author of a 2007 study showing that the products of MHC genes were involved in synaptic pruning in normal developing brains. But how important was this C4 protein, exactly? Very important, it turned out: Mice bred without the genes that produce C4 showed clear signs that their synaptic pruning had gone awry, Dr. Stevens's lab found. Taken together, Dr. Stevens said in an interview, ""the evidence strongly suggested that too much C4-A leads to inappropriate pruning during this critical phase of development.""

In particular, the authors concluded, too much C4-A could mean too much pruning -- which would explain not only the thinner prefrontal layers in schizophrenia, but also the reason that the disorder most often shows itself in people's teenage years or early twenties. ""The finding connects all these dots, all these disconnected observations about schizophrenia, and makes them make sense,"" Dr. McCarroll said. Carrying a gene variant that facilitates aggressive pruning is hardly enough to cause schizophrenia; far too many other factors are at work. Having such a variant, Dr. McCarroll estimates, would increase a person's risk by about 25 percent over the 1 percent base rate of schizophrenia -- that is, to 1.25 percent. That is not nearly enough to justify testing in the general population, even if further research confirms the new findings and clarifies the roles of other associated genes. Yet the equation changes when it comes to young people who are at very high risk of developing the disorder, because they are showing early signs -- a sudden slippage in mental acuity and memory, or even internal ""voices"" that seem oddly real. This ominous period may last a year or more, and often does not lead to full-blown schizophrenia. The researchers hope that the at-risk genetic profile, once it has been fleshed out more completely, will lead to the discovery of biomarkers that could help clarify a prognosis in these people. Developing a drug to slow or modulate pruning poses another kind of challenge. If the new study shows anything, it is that synaptic pruning is a delicate, exquisitely timed process, and that it is still poorly understood. The team does not yet know, for example, why C4-A leads to a different rate or kind of pruning than C4-B. Any medication that tampered with that system would be a risky proposition, the authors and outside experts agreed. ""We're all very excited and proud of this work,"" Dr. Lander said. ""But I'm not ready to call it a victory until we have something that can help patients.""","A new study provides researchers with their first biological handle on the disorder, and helps explain why it often begins at a relatively young age.",e22f76ab-5831-519b-b6c0-4df58fa320db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/28/science/28SCHIZOPHRENIA5/28SCHIZOPHRENIA5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=aacfc4cc51940edbcc6fb224728745d7bbc7dd5aeed051d69961359ecc6fd0f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An image from a fluorescent microscope showing C4 proteins, in green, located at the synapses in a culture of human neurons.",e22f76ab-5831-519b-b6c0-4df58fa320db,N24News/imgs/e22f76ab-5831-519b-b6c0-4df58fa320db.jpg,1
Health,Patients Lose Sight After Stem Cells Are Injected Into Their Eyes,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/15/health/eyes-stem-cells-injections.html,"Three women suffered severe, permanent eye damage after stem cells were injected into their eyes, in an unproven treatment at a loosely regulated clinic in Florida, doctors reported in an article published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine. One, 72, went completely blind from the injections, and the others, 78 and 88, lost much of their eyesight. Before the procedure, all had some visual impairment but could see well enough to drive. The cases expose gaps in the ability of government health agencies to protect consumers from unproven treatments offered by entrepreneurs who promote the supposed healing power of stem cells. The women had macular degeneration, an eye disease that causes vision loss, and they paid $5,000 each to receive stem-cell injections in 2015 at a private clinic in Sunrise, Fla. The clinic was part of a company then called Bioheart, now called U.S. Stem Cell. Staff members there used liposuction to suck fat out of the women's bellies, and then extracted stem cells from the fat to inject into the women's eyes.

The disastrous results were described in detail in the journal article, by doctors who were not connected to U.S. Stem Cell and treated the patients within days of the injections. An accompanying article by scientists from the Food and Drug Administration warned that stem cells from fat ""are being used in practice on the basis of minimal clinical evidence of safety or efficacy, sometimes with the claims that they constitute revolutionary treatments for various conditions."" Kristin C. Comella, the chief science officer of U.S. Stem Cell, said in an interview that the clinic did not need F.D.A. approval because it was treating patients with their own cells, which are not a drug. She said the stem-cell treatments were comparable to patients' receiving grafts of their own skin -- a procedure not a drug. Two of the eye patients sued the clinic and settled, but it has faced no other penalties. Ms. Comella said it no longer treats eyes, but continues to treat five to 20 patients a week for other problems like torn knee cartilage and degenerating spinal discs. All three women found U.S. Stem Cell because it had listed a study on a government website, clinicaltrials.gov -- provided by the National Institutes of Health. Two later told doctors they thought they were participating in government-approved research. But no study ever took place, and the proposed study on the site had no government endorsement. Clinical trials do not need government approval to be listed on the website.

Promising stem-cell research in eye disease and other conditions is taking place. But researchers and health officials have been warning for years that patients are at risk from hundreds of private clinics that have sprung up around the United States and overseas, offering stem-cell treatments for all manner of ailments, like injured knees, damaged spinal discs, neurological diseases and heart failure. Businesses promising ""regenerative medicine"" have multiplied, with little or no regulation. Stem cells, which can develop into many different types of cells, are thought to have tremendous potential to repair or replace tissue damaged by disease, injury or aging. But so far, the F.D.A. has approved only a few stem-cell products to treat certain blood disorders. The women in Florida suffered detached retinas, in which the thin layer of light-sensing cells that send signals to the optic nerve pulls away from the back of the eye -- a condition that usually needs prompt surgery to prevent blindness. Doctors who examined the patients said they suspected that the stem cells had grown onto the retina and then contracted, pulling it off the eyeball. One woman had such high pressure inside her eyes -- about three times the normal level -- that it may have damaged her optic nerves. Doctors operated quickly to relieve the pressure, but she became blind. ""The really horrible thing about this is that you would never, nobody practicing good medicine would ever do an experimental procedure on a patient on both eyes on the same day,"" said Dr. Thomas A. Albini, an author of the article who saw two of the patients, at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. Standard practice, he said, is to treat one eye at a time, usually the worse eye first, so that if something goes wrong at least the patient still has one eye left with some vision.

Dr. Albini said his team alerted the F.D.A. after the second patient showed up. ""They did send an investigator who took statements from us,"" he said. ""They apparently wrote up a report, which as far as I know is still not finished or available for public consumption."" Andrea Fischer, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A. said the agency could not comment on whether an investigation had been conducted. Two of the women were not available for interviews because their lawsuit settlements in 2016 included nondisclosure agreements, according to their lawyer, Andrew B. Yaffa, of Coral Gables, Fla. He also was barred from discussing the case, but a publicly available complaint he filed in July 2016 details one patient's story, and states that the injections were performed by a nurse practitioner who was introduced as a physician. The third patient did not sue, but did not respond to a request for an interview made through her doctor. (The patients were not named in the journal article.) Ms. Comella, from U.S. Stem Cell, said that an independent review board had approved the proposed eye study, including the plan to treat both eyes at once. She said a total of three patients ever received eye injections at the clinic, and were not part of a trial. She declined to confirm that they were the same three patients described in the journal article, but the article links the women to the clinic.

She declined to discuss the cases further, citing the nondisclosure agreement. But she said that U.S. Stem Cell had successfully treated thousands of patients for other conditions, and that it was misleading to draw attention to ""a handful of adverse events."" U.S. Stem Cell also makes money by training doctors to extract stem cells from fat. And in a blog post on Tuesday its chief executive, Mike Tomas, said the company expected to open clinics throughout the Middle East, in Kuwait, Dubai and Qatar. But the company, which is a penny stock, is struggling financially, and as recently as last fall warned investors that its poor financial situation put it at risk of going out of business. Clinics like U.S. Stem Cell that extract stem cells from fat fall into a gray zone. Regulations say stem cells do not have to be F.D.A. approved if they are the patient's own and are ""minimally manipulated"" -- but some clinics may stretch that term to suit their own purposes. The F.D.A. website has a page that warns ""the hope that patients have for cures not yet available may leave them vulnerable to unscrupulous providers of stem-cell treatments that are illegal and potentially harmful."" The F.D.A. article in The New England Journal of Medicine suggested that adverse events from stem-cell treatments ""are probably much more common than is appreciated, because there is no reporting requirement when these therapies are administered outside clinical investigations."" Like the Florida patients, people who consult clinicaltrials.gov may assume that the studies listed there have been approved by the F.D.A. or the National Institutes of Health, but that is not necessarily the case, Renate Myles, an N.I.H. spokeswoman, said.

In an email, Ms. Myles said, ""The information on ClinicalTrials.gov is provided by the study sponsor or principal investigator and posting on ClinicalTrials.gov does not necessarily reflect endorsement by the N.I.H. ClinicalTrials.gov does not independently verify the scientific validity or relevance of the trial itself beyond a limited quality control review."" Ms. Myles said that the site urges patients to consult their own doctors about joining studies and includes caveats in multiple places. ""However, we agree that such caveats need to be clearer to all users and will be adding a more prominent disclaimer in the near future,"" she added.","Three women suffered severe eye damage at a Florida clinic, exposing gaps in protections for people seeking unproven treatments.",381724f2-ddab-5c4c-9ad3-68ae713b36ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/16/science/16BLIND/16BLIND-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=d5891e33ee41f32d5a48ab3851342e47d58f86e7728130b3b35a831999aca165&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The left eye of a patient showing hemorrhages 13 days after stem-cell injection.,381724f2-ddab-5c4c-9ad3-68ae713b36ac,N24News/imgs/381724f2-ddab-5c4c-9ad3-68ae713b36ac.jpg,1
Television,Review: 'We Are Who We Are' Captures Not-So-Innocents Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/13/arts/television/review-we-are-who-we-are.html,"Jordan Kristine Seamon, left, and Francesca Scorsese in ""We Are Who We Are,"" a new series that is set in 2016.



The supermarket at the U.S. Army base in Chioggia, Italy, looks as if it could be anywhere in the world. That's exactly the point. As Britney (Francesca Scorsese), a teen living on base, explains it to new kid Fraser (Jack Dylan Grazer), all the military stores like it are precisely alike, down to the same items in the same places in the same aisles. ""So we don't get lost,"" she says. Good luck with that. Getting lost is the natural condition of humans, and teenagers in general: You wander, get waylaid, and in the process hopefully find out who you are. That process is the subject of ""We Are Who We Are,"" the languid, lusty, sun-baked teen drama from Luca Guadagnino (""Call Me by Your Name"") that begins Monday on HBO.

We meet Fraser, in fact, staring at a ""Lost and Found"" sign at an Italian airport, where he has arrived with his mother Sarah (Chloe Sevigny), the new commander of the base, and his other mother, Maggie (Alice Braga). Sulky and withdrawn under a protective helmet of bleached hair -- he would rather have stayed home in New York -- he sets off to explore the base and Chioggia, running into a group of Army kids off for an afternoon at the beach.

Introverted and flinchy, Fraser is an unsettling character to enter the story through, with an awkward, defensive personality and hints of a troubled past. At one point he slaps Sarah over a minor annoyance; at another, she accidentally cuts herself and he instinctively puts her finger in his own mouth. They fight and comfort each other intimately, and his problems seem to frustrate and terrify her. (Sevigny, who made her debut in Larry Clark's 1995 teen-panic flick, ""Kids,"" is nuanced and convincing as the commanding officer uncertain on the home front.) But he is a lot of work, maybe more work than you'll want to invest as a viewer. But ""We Are"" opens outward with the second episode, which shows us the same day through the eyes of Fraser's neighbor Caitlin (Jordan Kristine Seamon, an astonishing newcomer). She's more settled than Fraser -- popular and close to her conservative father (Scott Mescudi, better known as the rapper Kid Cudi) -- but is also searching for her place, experimenting with her gender expression and testing her friendships. As the two meet and form a close, platonic alliance, the focus broadens to Caitlin's circle of friends -- white and Black, Christian and Muslim, American and European, military and civilian, all thrown together in a limbo that's both America and Italy and yet not wholly either, living a curious existence that's both tightly regimented and exhilaratingly free. I'm not sure if this is a realistic portrait either of overseas base life or of military family dynamics, but the uncanniness of the setting feels key to the story. The series's real setting is adolescence. The physical location is simply an otherworldly backdrop for its flirtations and fights to play out against, like an enchanted wood in a Shakespeare comedy.

It's funny that it took an Italian director to see the potential in the stories of American military kids. But then again, an American might have been more burdened by the urge to comment topically. There's little military politics in the first four episodes (of eight), other than a slowly percolating subplot about deploying soldiers to Afghanistan. And American politics creep in only at the edges, with ads and TV footage from the Trump and Clinton campaigns (the series is set in 2016) and the MAGA hats that Caitlin's father orders for the two of them, though campaign gear is forbidden on base. All these touches, so far, feel more like quirkily deployed set dressing than statements. Many of the supporting characters are thinly drawn, and the plot is slight and shaggy. Friends ally and drift apart, arguments whip up and dissipate like summer cloudbursts. Guadagnino's gift here is more for atmosphere and emotion, and the episodes burst with them. They're rich with sun and salt and a touch of melancholy. The camera revels in the Labrador-like energy with which these kids -- except Fraser -- leap into any available body of water. There's a lot of leaping in ""We Are Who We Are,"" figurative and literal. The young characters make impulsive life decisions with the same energy they use for dangerous, illicit rides on the Army-base zip line. (Guadagnino, who shares the writing with Paolo Giordano and Francesca Manieri, also has an eye for a great visual metaphor.) All this comes together in the fourth episode, centered on an impulsive, all-night house party. It's a finely detailed, living fresco of libido and intoxication, all these teenagers inhabiting their bodies as if they were just-unwrapped birthday presents.",Luca Guadagnino's HBO series is a heady teen drama of hormones and self-discovery on a U.S. Army base in Italy.,0552d53d-994a-5147-bfd8-ef341f303784,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/14/arts/13whoweare/13whoweare-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e75584a669b670e2a5bcb1919c7a064235f22085f14e82c5469a6720d51af310&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jordan Kristine Seam&oacute;n, left, and Francesca Scorsese in ""We Are Who We Are,"" a new series that is set in 2016.",0552d53d-994a-5147-bfd8-ef341f303784,N24News/imgs/0552d53d-994a-5147-bfd8-ef341f303784.jpg,3
Books,A Comic Force of Nature: The Life — and Death — of Robin Williams,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/15/books/review/robin-williams-biography-dave-itzkoff.html,"More than once in ""Robin,"" Williams upends a happy domestic situation -- most notably, the second and longest-lasting of his three marriages, to his former assistant Marsha Garces -- by behaving rashly and betraying someone's trust. Williams also suffers from chronic status anxiety, despairing over the slow start to his film career (which doesn't achieve box-office liftoff until ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" in 1987), and, even after he has become a bona fide movie star, fretting that his place in the comedy firmament is being usurped by some upstart -- say, Jim Carrey during his ""Ace Ventura: Pet Detective"" ascendancy.

The conventional wisdom on comics, especially troubled ones, is that their funniness comes from pain. But ""Robin"" doesn't support this thesis. Williams's father, Rob, was taciturn and distant but essentially decent -- a long way from the bitter, envious dad with whom Steve Martin contends in his fine memoir of making it big, ""Born Standing Up."" Williams's mother, Laurie, who grew up in New Orleans, was warm and encouraging. ""I started to be charming and funny for her,"" Williams once said, ""and I learned that by being entertaining, you make a connection with another person."" Young Robin certainly dealt with his share of solitude, living in a succession of large houses in the Detroit suburbs, often left to his own devices, alone but for elaborate battalions of toy soldiers. Nonetheless, he enjoyed a healthy social life, got good grades and played on varsity sports teams.

So what made him tick, for better and for worse? Here is where ""Robin,"" for all its length, comes up a little short. Itzkoff, to his credit, is nothing if not meticulous. He had access to members of Williams's family, most prominently the eldest of Robin's children, Zak, and interviewed Robin himself several times in the actor's final decade. And to the roll call of prestige interviewees that includes Williams's friends and peers Billy Crystal, David Letterman and Eric Idle, add the daughter of Williams's high school wrestling coach, the guy with whom he performed mime routines in Central Park in the early 1970s, and sundry lesser-known comics from Williams's up-and-comer days.

Still, all of this legwork brings us no closer to understanding what made Robin Williams so inimitably Robin Williams-like. The antic, full-bore Williams persona seems to have emerged shortly after his family's move to the San Francisco Bay Area in 1968, when Williams was a senior in high school. But the ""Why?"" of it remains a mystery.

I would have appreciated some more authorial imposition, some attempts by Itzkoff to collate what he has learned and what he thinks into some psychological insights into Williams's character. As it is, the closest we get to this are some telling comments from Williams's intimates, scattered throughout the book, the best coming from the women in his life. Dawber posits of Williams's unending eagerness to please, ""My personal opinion of it was that he probably didn't get enough of his mother."" Valerie Velardi, Williams's first wife, believes that his peripatetic childhood and giftedness went hand in hand, resulting in a ""very rich private life"" that made it ""hard to get in deep with someone who's used to taking care of himself only.""

In fairness to Itzkoff, it's this very will-o'-the-wisp quality that makes Williams a tricky man to pin down. ""Robin"" is as definitive an account as we're ever likely to have of the man, but, like the shape-shifting genie he voiced in Disney's ""Aladdin,"" Williams was not entirely of this earth, and a part of him will always elude capture.","Dave Itzkoff's exhaustive biography, ""Robin,"" explains why a great comedian ""had admirers but no imitators.""",d0ed0d69-776b-5ecc-a749-f6dac8b62a09,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/03/books/review/03kamp-top/03kamp-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=42f66a539fa8a6aaf07796f8255af32f822016dfdaaadfe30c29dc9b5cd360aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Robin Williams in 1979.,d0ed0d69-776b-5ecc-a749-f6dac8b62a09,N24News/imgs/d0ed0d69-776b-5ecc-a749-f6dac8b62a09.jpg,13
Science,"In the Deep, Dark Sea, Corals Create Their Own Sunshine",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/07/science/coral-fluorescence-deep-sea.html,"Corals are pretty and colorful and fluorescent. They produce their vibrant colors because they don't live alone, which is also what keeps them alive. Over billions of years they've worked out a special arrangement with algae: Corals give them shelter and algae convert light into food for the corals. Corals do other things for the algae, too. Deep inside their tissue are little proteins that take the sun's ultraviolet light and turn it into a glowing green sunscreen, shielding from the sun these corals that live just below the water's surface.

But deeper in the water, it's dark and the little light that reaches that far down is only in the blue part of the spectrum. Somehow, there are corals that live up to hundreds of feet below the surface and also manage to glow burning hues of orange and red.

The reasons for this fluorescence have remained a mystery, until now: These deep-sea corals glow to get more sunlight, according to a study published on Wednesday in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B. Their proteins soak up the scarce light and shine it back out as red-orange light that penetrates deep inside their tissues where their microscopic roommates take up residence. This means there's light for photosynthesis, and the algae creates energy and food for the coral. ""This is a strategy that some corals pursue to cope with the challenges of a low-light environment,"" Prof. Joerg Wiedenmann, a biologist at the University of Southampton in Britain who led the study, wrote in an email. It's quite an adaptation, with a brilliant byproduct.

The research could have implications for coral-reef conservation by highlighting how different species of coral adapt to various light conditions. For two decades scientists have considered the idea that deep-sea reefs might provide a safe haven for shallow-water corals during threatening times of extreme heat. The thought is that shallow coral larvae pulled down by currents could survive long enough to reproduce and send their offspring back near the surface when temperatures returned to normal. But ""the depth might not offer a convenient escape road,"" said Dr. Wiedenmann. He said he worries that shallow-water corals may not be able to adapt to the little light down deep.",Corals that live up to hundreds of feet below the ocean's surface have worked out a special arrangement with algae that's mutually beneficial for the two.,240c6823-3c8d-55aa-89cd-689626944368,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/08/science/08tb-corals01/08tb-corals01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=460dea978fd4baec412580486b0e6db59743925a4aac9f94ef22c865533f06bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Echinophyllia sp., a deep water coral that produces fluorescent orange-red light.",240c6823-3c8d-55aa-89cd-689626944368,N24News/imgs/240c6823-3c8d-55aa-89cd-689626944368.jpg,2
Fashion & Style,A 'Dreamer' Finds His Sense of Belonging,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/fashion/weddings/a-dreamer-finds-his-sense-of-belonging.html,"Allison Tyndall and Fariaz Rabbani were married Feb. 18 in Central Park. Kyla Kuvach, a friend of the couple, officiated.





A few weeks after Fariaz Rabbani proposed to Allison Tyndall, he took her to a bank in Queens, where he opened a safe deposit box filled with jewelry once worn by his mother. ""The jewelry was meant to be given to my future wife, as my mother was not sure if she would ever meet her,"" said Mr. Rabbani, 35, recalling that bittersweet day in August 2019. ""In fact, my mother wasn't quite sure if she would ever see me again."" His mother, Fatema Rabbani, is alive and well in her native Bangladesh, as is his father, Golam Rabbani. They live in Barisal, one of the oldest municipalities and river ports in the country. ""I call them once a month just to say hello,"" said Dr. Tyndall, 39, an English teacher at Regis High School in Manhattan. ""They are such beautiful people.""

Despite her affection for Mr. Rabbani's parents, Dr. Tyndall has never met them in person, and Mr. Rabbani, their only child, has not been in their company since February 2013, when they retired and left their Sunnyside, Queens neighborhood to return to Bangladesh. Their departure left Mr. Rabbani alone in an uncertain world of so-called dreamers, the hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, and who had hoped to gain a pathway to permanent legal status through the Dream Act, a 2001 bill that never passed in Congress. (In 2012, dreamers received temporary protection from deportation through an Obama-era program, the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, which the Trump administration rescinded in 2017. Litigation ensued, and the cancellation of the program was put on hold until the Supreme Court makes a decision on the matter, which is expected sometime this year.)

Mr. Rabbani, who was 8 years old when his mother took him to the United States -- his father had already arrived in Queens -- is not allowed to travel outside of the United States, nor can his parents make a return visit to see him, as they are also stymied by stringent immigration laws. ""I've gotten used to the idea of not being able to leave the country,"" said Mr. Rabbani, who graduated from Queens College with a psychology degree in 2006. ""The travel thing was more difficult to handle when I was younger and wanted to see Europe, or go home to see my family."" ""Both of my grandmothers died in Bangladesh, and I couldn't be there because I couldn't leave here,"" he said, his voice cracking. ""Those were very difficult days."" The ensuing days have been no less difficult for Mr. Rabbani and his parents. Reached at her home in Bangladesh recently, the groom's mother sobbed when told that on her son's wedding day, a pair of her earrings, made of rubies and gold, would be worn by Dr. Tyndall. ""I miss my son, and I wish I could meet Allison,"" she said through her tears. ""I hope that one day we can all be together.""

""She was beautiful, and I could tell right away that she was really intelligent,"" he said. ""I couldn't wait to meet her in person."" Dr. Tyndall, the only daughter of William Tyndall of Girard, Ohio, graduated from the University of Toledo in 2002 with a journalism degree and received a master's degree in English from DePaul University. She also has a Ph.D. in English literature from Stony Brook University. ""When I first saw Fariaz, I thought he was really cute, but he was a comedian, and I thought comedians were egotistic, so I clicked off his profile,"" she said. ""But then I thought, 'I'm a better person than this, I should be more open,' so I clicked back on him."" She introduced herself online and ""he responded with a couple of cursory questions that I answered and that he ignored,"" she said, laughing. ""Then he asked if I wanted to go out for a drink."" She said yes, and they arranged for a first date at a Manhattan bar.

""He was quick and witty and really charming and flirtatious, and maybe a bit too forward,"" said Dr. Tyndall, who was then an instructor of English at Stony Brook University. ""He was also very smart, and appeared emotionally well-adjusted."" Dr. Tyndall told Mr. Rabbani that her father was mulling retirement as a letter carrier in Youngstown, Ohio and that her stepmother, Barbara Tyndall, who has three children of her own, was about to retire as a special-education teacher in Trumbull County, Ohio. Mr. Rabbani, who appeared recently in a short play, ""Lost Boys,"" at the Hudson Guild Theater in Manhattan, spent two years honing his craft at the William Esper Studio, studying under the direction of Barbara Marchant. [Sign up for Love Letter and always get the latest in Modern Love, weddings, and relationships in the news by email.] By the time he met Dr. Tyndall, he had already taken his brand of comedic acting on ""Inside Amy Schumer,"" and in the ensuing months would appear on ""The Steve Harvey Show"" and ""The Nightly Show With Larry Wilmore."" Yet before he laughed alongside such household names on national television, he spent many nights in a lonely apartment in Queens, with no family to lean on after his mother, who worked as a nanny in New York, and his father, who drove a taxi cab, went back to Bangladesh.

""My life has been filled with too many wasted years,"" he said. Indeed, Mr. Rabbani was 27 in 2012 when he was finally able to get a work permit, which came immediately after DACA provided temporary protection, he was 28 when he got a driver's license. ""Due to my undocumented status, I couldn't do the things that most teenagers traditionally do, like working and driving,"" said Mr. Rabbani, who took jobs at a McDonald's in Queens and later at a car dealership there before turning his attention to acting and comedy. ""There wasn't a friend I trusted enough with whom I felt I could share my frustrations,"" he said. ""But I really needed someone to talk to at that time, so I ended up seeing a therapist."" Dr. Tyndall, an American citizen of English, Irish and Hungarian descent, said that marrying Mr. Rabbani would not affect his immigration status, and that while she felt ""terrible"" about his situation, she never once considered it a deal-breaker as far as their relationship went.

They began dating steadily and traveling as often and as far away as they could within the legal boundaries of Mr. Rabbani's world, including trips to Hawaii and Puerto Rico. ""I have never felt limited by the travel restrictions put upon Fariaz as much as I have felt a sense of hopelessness regarding his situation,"" Dr. Tyndall said. ""Nothing will ever change unless Congress comes together and changes their ridiculous immigration laws."" They were engaged Aug. 1, 2019, in Mr. Rabbani's Sunnyside apartment that he now shares with Dr. Tyndall, along with their two adopted cats, Billy Zane and Rose, and their 8-month-old Corgi, Rambo. ""Every day with Fariaz is like a vacation day,"" Dr. Tyndall said. ""He's a very intelligent, driven and passionate person, and though he can be a little headstrong at times, he's so much fun to be around."" They were married Feb. 18 at the Lake viewing area in Central Park, gathering on a cloudy day before Kyla Kuvach, a friend of the couple who became a Universal Life minister for the event. Jesse DeZenzo, Ms. Kuvach's fiance, was their only witness. Ms. Kuvach, who was once the groom's roommate, is now a public defender in the Bronx. ""Our immigration laws are racist, not functional and do not recognize or reward valuable members of our society, like Fariaz,"" she said as she brushed away tears.

Since Mr. Rabbani's parents could not attend the ceremony, the bride and groom chose to honor them by making it a low-key affair, with no attendants or attendees. Dr. Tyndall, clutching a bouquet of pink and ivory roses and ranunculus began her vows: ""Now that I know where this is going, I want to thank you for everything you are to me. For being practical and playful, for being emotionally available, supportive and even therapeutic at times."" Then it was the groom's turn. ""Allison, when I met you I was searching for a purpose in life and trying to have a sense of belonging, be it somewhere or with someone,"" he said. ""And every time I'd see you I wouldn't want it to end because I'd feel like where I belong is wherever you are."" The newlyweds began making their way out of the park, the bride turning heads in a blush wedding gown and ivory veil by David's Bridal, the groom looking sharp in a black tuxedo by Calvin Klein. A cyclist sped past them and put smiles on their faces by shouting ""Congratulations, God bless both of you!"" Mr. Rabbani was smiling a short time later at Asiate, a restaurant inside the Mandarin Oriental hotel on Columbus Circle, where the small wedding party celebrated. He mentioned that he had called his mother immediately after the ceremony to tell her and his father that he had just been married, and that he would soon be sending them the video, via email. ""I love you both and I'm always praying for you,"" his mother told him during that call. ""I wish I could have been there in person.""

Where The Lake viewing area, Central Park in New York Meet the Bride On her Christmas break this year, the bride is planning to travel to Bangladesh, alone and for the first time, to meet her in-laws. A Ring and a Kiss In September 2019, five weeks after the couple got engaged, the bride walked through her father's door in Girard, Ohio, wearing her new engagement ring. ""He was like 'awww,' and then he kissed my ring,"" Dr. Tyndall said, laughing. ""He's a very sentimental man, and I thought it was sweet."" On Video The bride's father also received the wedding video. ""Of course you want to be at your daughter's wedding, but my wife and I understood their reasoning and we respect it,"" he said.

Health,"In Remote Villages, Surprising New Measures Save Children With Malaria",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/health/malaria-children-zambia.html,"During malaria season, children who live in remote villages are at tremendous risk. When parasites transmitted by mosquitoes swarm into the brain, the disease can kill within 24 hours.

Often parents do not realize quickly enough how close a toddler is to death. More than 90 percent of malaria deaths are in children under five years old.

Now, after 13 years of effort, a set of stopgap measures to keep youngsters alive long enough to get them to a clinic has been developed. Initial testing suggests the measures can dramatically cut death rates; in one pilot project in Zambia, they dropped by 96 percent.

The most important new element is artesunate delivered as a soft rectal suppository. Artesunate is the drug that hospitals inject into children in mortal danger from malaria infections of the brain. The new version comes in a form that can be given by a village health worker or even a parent.","Malaria quickly kills toddlers.

Ms. Goldstein, who has a passion for travel, said she was ""intrigued,"" by the many places that Mr. Nosal had visited as she perused his dating profile. Included were photos of the pyramids in Egypt, camels in Thailand and tropical beaches in South Korea, where Mr. Nasal lived from 2011 to 2013. ""He seemed liked this really adventurous guy,"" she said. Mr. Nosal said he was ""a bit shocked at first"" when Ms. Goldstein reached out to him. ""This was a beautiful woman, and a lawyer no less,"" he said. ""I wasn't even in her league."" A week later, they went on the kind of first date that Ms. Goldstein had not been on in her 18 months of online dating: a sunset ferry ride on the East River and a picnic in Brooklyn Bridge Park. ""Every first date was an invite for drinks,"" she said. ""I was completely impressed with his creativity and thoughtfulness.""

In a month's time they were dating steadily. ""I loved his goofy, clever sense of humor,"" Ms. Goldstein said. ""I appreciated his ability to be endlessly enthusiastic about any situation. He was just a lot of fun to be around."" In May 2018, Mr. Nosal took Ms. Goldstein, who has loved elephants since she was a child, to an elephant camp on the border of Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Though Ms. Goldstein had a notion that Mr. Nosal would ask her to marry him on that trip -- their second visit to Thailand -- she did not know that one of the elephants would get in on the act. Moments later, as Ms. Goldstein posed for a photo with Mr. Nosal and several of the elephants, Mr. Nosal surreptitiously slipped a box over to Yuki, a middle-age female elephant.

Television,HBO Erases the 'Game of Thrones' Coffee Cup,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/arts/television/game-of-thrones-coffee-cup-removed-hbo.html,"Fans of ""Game of Thrones"" flooded the internet with japes about a scene in Sunday night's episode that showed an out-of-place coffee cup in the show's fantasy world, but now HBO has rewritten Westerosi history.

Less than 48 hours after Episode 4 of Season 8 dropped, the cup was edited out of the scene on HBO's streaming platform, a spokeswoman confirmed. (Future rebroadcasts on cable TV will also exclude the cup.)

That's right. While the big, bad Night King failed to ""erase the memory of Westeros,"" as Bran Stark put it, HBO was able to do so using the magic of digital editing.

Opinion,[Black Lives Matter Is Winning,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/opinion/black-lives-matter-protests.html,"To hear more audio stories from publishers like The New York Times, download Audm for iPhone or Android. It's wondrous, isn't it, how the people just keep coming out? Day after day, night after night, in dozens of cities, braving a deadly virus and brutal retaliation, they continue to pack the streets in uncountable numbers, demanding equality and justice -- and, finally, prompting what feels like real change. How did this happen? How did Black Lives Matter, a hashtag-powered movement that has been building for years, bring America to what looks like a turning point? I have a theory: The protests exploded in scale and intensity because the police seemed to go out of their way to illustrate exactly the arguments that Black Lives Matter has been raising online since 2013.

By ""the police,"" I mean not just state and municipal police across the country, but also the federal officers from various agencies that cracked down on protesters in front of the White House, as well as their supporters and political patrons, from police chiefs to mayors to the attorney general and the president himself. Black Lives Matter aims to highlight the depth of brutality, injustice and unaccountability that American society, especially law enforcement, harbors toward black people. Many protesters set out to call attention to the unchecked power of the police, their military weaponry and their capricious use of it. They wanted to show that the problem of policing in America is more than that of individual bad officers; the problem is a culture that protects wrongdoers, tolerates mendacity, rewards blind loyalty and is fiercely resistant to change. More deeply, it is a law enforcement culture that does not regard black lives as worthy of protection. And what did the cops do? They responded with a display of organized, unchecked power -- on camera, in a way that many Americans might never be able to unsee. To understand why this moment may prompt structural change, it is worth putting the latest protests into a larger context. To me, the past two weeks have felt like an echo of that heady moment late in 2017, after The New York Times and The New Yorker exposed Harvey Weinstein's history of sexual assault. At the time, #MeToo, as an online rallying cry against sexual abuse and harassment, was more than a decade old. The Weinstein story didn't create that movement, just as the videos of George Floyd's death at the hands of the Minneapolis police didn't create Black Lives Matter.

Instead, the Weinstein news broke the dam. Since then, #MeToo activism has gone on to upend society in a way that felt revolutionary. It feels like the dam is breaking again. The movement behind Black Lives Matter has taken to the streets before -- but nothing on this scale, with this intensity. And not with these results. The National Football League was once a powerful and bitter rival; now it has embraced the movement, though it still has not apologized to or signed Colin Kaepernick, the player who first knelt in protest against police brutality. Politicians at every level are professing newfound support, and, right before our eyes, the Overton window of acceptable public discourse about police reform has shifted to include terms like ""demilitarize,"" ""defund"" and ""abolish."" It's not clear how far the politics will go, but the shifts so far are significant. ""Never before in the history of modern polling has the country expressed such widespread agreement on racism's pervasiveness in policing, and in society at large,"" The Times reported last week. More important, we are no longer just talking about imposing new limits on how the police can operate. We're finally asking more substantive political questions: What roles should be reserved for the police in our cities, and what roles would better be served by hiring more teachers, social workers or mental health experts? In Los Angeles, where leaders on the left and the right have long showered resources on the police, the mayor has now proposed spending $250 million more on social services and $150 million less on policing. Last week, New York's mayor, Bill de Blasio, resisted cutting the $6 billion police budget; on Sunday, he promised future cuts. And in Minneapolis, a veto-proof majority of City Council members pledged to dismantle the city's police department.

The proximate cause of the latest protests was the horror of George Floyd's death. But we've seen videos of cops killing black men before and they have rarely led to criminal prosecution, let alone broad societal upheaval. What's happening now is about more than that video. Just as, after the Weinstein story broke, when women came forward with stories too numerous to ignore or dismiss, what we've seen in the last two weeks are episodes of excessive force too blatant and numerous to conclude that the problem is one of a few isolated cases. The evidence of police brutality has become too widespread even for elected officials to ignore. They can no longer easily coddle police unions in exchange for political support; now ignoring police misconduct will become a political liability, and perhaps something will change. Alex Vitale, a sociologist and the author of ""The End of Policing,"" which argues for a wholesale dismantling of American policing, told me that he has high hopes for structural change because organizers had laid the groundwork for it. ""My reason for optimism is that before Minneapolis happened, there were already dozens of campaigns to divert police funding,"" he said. ""So that's why that demand emerged so quickly -- people were already doing that work."" Vitale also suggested that the movement can take hold permanently, that what's happening now has cracked ""the 'ideological armor'"" of policing in America.

Ann Sullivan, who applied her refined brush and palette as an animator to latter-day Disney classics like ""The Little Mermaid,"" ""The Lion King"" and ""Lilo & Stitch,"" died on April 13 at the Motion Picture and Television Fund retirement home in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 91.

Her daughter Shannon Jay said the cause was Covid-19.

Ms. Sullivan was the third of four people at the home who have died from the coronavirus, according to a fund representative. More than 7,000 people have died of the disease in care facilities around the United States.","She contributed to modern favorites like ""The Little Mermaid"" and ""The Lion King.""

Fashion & Style,A Chat With the Ever-Evolving Tom Ford,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/fashion/mens-style/tom-ford-mens-fashion-week.html,"""It's a very sort of '70s thing to do,"" he said. ""There was, in the '70s, a moment when even a few luxury companies used to sell a tonal shirt and tie together in a plastic box. I love that."" He himself, as usual, was in his customary dark palette. ""I don't wear these kinds of colors,"" he said. ""You have to learn what works on you.""

His clients, on the other hand, are open to the full range of possibilities, from the boardroom-restrained to the ballroom-fabulous. Whatever the style, it leans toward the lavish. Mr. Ford showed tennis shoes but also pool slide sandals, in velvet -- an ornamental if not strictly functional touch, since velvet is a fabric you might want to keep at some distance from the pool.

""I don't know,"" he said, when a reporter offered that observation. ""I wear velvet all the time.""

Mr. Ford, 55, is not an uninterrupted presence in Milan, as some of his contemporaries are. He has hopscotched around the fashion weeks of the world, showing his men's wear and his women's wear sometimes by appointment, sometimes in runway shows, in different cities and different time frames: He experimented with the ""buy now, wear now"" model of showing clothes on the runway in season and making them immediately available, which, he said, ""unfortunately didn't work.""

And though he said he maintained focus on his collections throughout, he spent much of the past few years absorbed by his second film, ""Nocturnal Animals.""

Technology,"Bytedance of China Eyes $75 Billion Valuation, Joining Start-Up Giants",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/technology/bytedance-fundraising-toutiao-tiktok.html,"HONG KONG -- In the United States, the fortunes of giant social media companies such as Facebook and Twitter have wobbled as they have been blamed for abetting abusive discourse and hosting malicious political influence campaigns.

But in China, the titans of social media are still getting bigger and richer.

Bytedance, the creator of the news aggregator Jinri Toutiao, the video-sharing service Tik Tok and a fleet of other entertainment apps, is in discussions to raise new funding that would value the business at $75 billion, according to people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity to discuss confidential talks.

The Japanese conglomerate SoftBank is among the investors involved in the talks, one of these people said.

A $75 billion valuation would make Bytedance one of the world's most valuable private tech companies -- Uber was recently valued at $76 billion. It would also give Bytedance financial heft comparable to that of some publicly traded high-tech leaders.

Television,"'Mr. Robot' Season 4, Episode 4 Recap: Into the Woods",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/arts/television/mr-robot-recap.html,"Agent Dom DiPierro is having a nightmare before Christmas. Forced to become a double agent against her own government by the Dark Army, which has threatened to torture her mother to death if she rebels, Dom returns to a pastime we've seen her indulge in long before that sinister hacker collective got its hooks in her: joylessly masturbating by the glow of her laptop. When interrogation-room footage of her one-time quarry Darlene Alderson no longer does the trick, she launches a chat with an ostentatiously male-seeming anonymous partner -- since she is gay, this is a clear sign she's searching for any port in a storm. It is Christmas Eve, after all, and any balm against loneliness will do. So she's surprised, and borderline delighted, when her mystery chat partner reveals she is actually a woman who gets off on playacting as a man. By then, this stranger has already asked to meet her in the flesh and make good on all their dirty talk; now that Dom knows she's a woman, she is prepared to take her up on the offer. Things are going pretty hot and heavy when Dom excuses herself to use the bathroom. But when she steps inside, she finds the bath drawn and every surface covered with candles and rose petals. It would be romantic ... if it weren't for the fact that someone had to break into her apartment to do it. Suddenly her one-night stand appears behind her, wearing the distinctive demon mask of the Dark Army. The demon attacks, plunging Dom into the water of the bath and holding her under. Everything will be much easier, says the attacker, if Dom stops fighting: ""Realize you'll never be free.""

Then she wakes up, in bed, laptop across her stomach. Her anonymous partner gave up and logged out hours ago. It was all a bad dream, except for the part about being under the thumb of a horde of vicious killers. That's all too real. Even apart from Dom's actual nightmare, this episode of ""Mr. Robot"" leaps deftly back and forth over the line of dream logic. Its efforts are aided by the late Christmas Eve setting -- the small hours after midnight when the world seems fast asleep, clearing the way for a sleigh drawn by magical reindeer. The only deer we see in this episode, however, is roadkill. While Dom dreams her uneasy dreams, Darlene embarks on a quest to meet up with her brother Elliot, who has fled the city after being followed to his apartment by the Dark Army. She has important information to give him about the next step in destroying the Deus Group, the top-secret organization of power brokers led by the Dark Army's commander, Whiterose. But because Elliot has been so cruel to her lately, she would almost rather not speak to him again. Her companion on her journey is an extraordinarily drunk man named Tobias who catches her trying to hot-wire his car. (At least, he thinks it's his car until he realizes hours later that it isn't. Like I said, he is extraordinarily drunk.) Tobias's distinguishing characteristic, aside from inebriation, is his disheveled Santa costume, which he wears to cheer up children in Sloan Kettering's pediatric cancer ward. He says he drinks to numb the pain of encountering so many smiling children he knows won't make it through. By the time they arrive at Tobias's house -- Darlene agrees to give him a lift home in exchange for ""borrowing"" the car -- Darlene is concerned that Tobias might take his own life. It's all a big misunderstanding, as Darlene misinterprets various innocuous statements made by Tobias -- a reference to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" a Steinbeck quote -- as cries for help.

But by now, Tobias is sober enough to realize it is Darlene who really needs help. Surrounded by Christmas decorations, she pours her heart out, explaining how nearly everyone she has ever been close to is dead -- except for Elliot, who she is worried may be next. Tobias reassures her. S ometimes, a pep talk from Santa is just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, Darlene is right to worry about her brother. Though he and Tyrell manage to get the drop on the operative who was following him, the operative is significantly less dead than they believed him to be. When they pull over at a remote service station to buy gasoline and a lighter to torch the body and the Dark Army van they stole, they emerge to discover that their victim has recovered and driven off, stranding them. What follows is the episode's most visually surreal story line, as Wellick, Elliot and Elliot's Mr. Robot persona wander through the woods in search of the closest town. It's a starkly lit journey with the bright moonlight casting shadows and reflecting off the snow. In a smart bit of staging, the three men are nearly always shown marching from the right side of the screen to the left -- forcing the viewer's eye to reverse its normal left-to-right movement and almost subliminally making the trek seem more arduous. Haunted by the belief that they're marching to their doom and by the strange howl of a distant, unidentified animal, they eventually find a road -- and a dead deer, killed by the Dark Army agent's van before it crashed several yards away. Elliot and Wellick approach the van from different angles when suddenly the operative opens fire, mortally wounding Wellick before killing himself. Wellick spent their time in the woods bemoaning the fact that Elliot didn't care about him. But in the end, it is he who must insist that Elliot leave him behind in order to save himself, something Elliot refuses to do until Wellick insists. Wandering back into the woods to die, Wellick appears to find the source of the strange animal sounds: an unseen object emitting a cold blue light. As Wellick gazes in wonder, the screen fades to white. Arguably the strangest, most volatile character on ""Mr. Robot"" is given a moment of beauty and grace before dying, at the end of one of the show's strangest and most deeply empathetic episodes.
* None Wellick theorizes that Elliot wears the same clothes all the time -- black hoodie, black jeans, black shoes -- because he just doesn't care what anyone else thinks of him and perhaps doesn't care about anyone either.

Food,"To Make Its Case, Armagnac Has to Teach the Teachers",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/dining/drinks/armagnac-brandy.html,"Fine & Rare, a restaurant and bar in Midtown Manhattan, recently held an Armagnac tasting to educate its servers and bartenders about the lesser-known French brandy.

To Make Its Case, Armagnac Has to Teach the Teachers

On a darkening, cold afternoon, before a crackling fireplace inside Fine & Rare's candlelit dining room, several servers and bartenders gathered recently for a training seminar on the lesser-known French brandy, Armagnac. Fine & Rare, a year-old restaurant and bar near Grand Central Terminal, had added more than a dozen Armagnacs to its menu, and the employees needed to learn how to sell them. May Matta-Aliah -- an official Armagnac educator for the Bureau National Interprofessionel de l'Armagnac -- poured eight brandies for each and began to explain Armagnac's appeal. ""Education"" has become the prevalent sales buzzword for bars that pour high-end liquors, with the idea that enthusiastic customers will buy and drink spirits they've never heard of, if only someone can teach them why. But in order to tell the 700-year-old story of Armagnac to their customers, the educators themselves often need to be educated. ""First of all, most importantly, Armagnac is from France,"" Ms. Matta-Aliah said. She focused on the sparsely populated region of Gascony, in the southwest. ""Ducks and geese -- for foie gras -- outnumber humans,"" she said. ""This is not a wealthy area, so put away your images of grand chateaus.""

Ms. Matta-Aliah explained the distillation process, the region's three geographic subzones, which grapes are used to make the base wine and how Armagnac differs from whiskey or other brown spirits -- namely, that the raw ingredient is grapes, not grain, agave or molasses. Over the course of an hour, Fine & Rare's employees tasted brandies from top producers like Tariquet, Darroze and Casterede. ""When I taste Scotch and bourbon, I feel like the first thing you get is the oak, but this is all so different,"" said Greg Homidoff, a server. ""They're like French perfumes.""

""There's such a need for education when it comes to Armagnac,"" said Nicolas Palazzi, the owner of PM Spirits in Bushwick, Brooklyn, an importer of several Armagnac brands, including Domaine d'Esperance, one of the spirits poured at the tasting. ""We go out, and we explain, and we do training and we let people taste the stuff. At our level, it's one buyer at a time. We're creating our own demand."" Armagnac is single-distilled at a low temperature in column stills -- in contrast to Cognac's double distillation in pot stills -- and some houses are so small that they don't even own stills, employing roving distillers that go from estate to estate. The single distillation means that fewer of Armagnac's natural elements are stripped out, making a more boisterous, rustic brandy. ""We have no perfect Armagnac,"" said Marc Darroze, whose family's Darroze label was one of the first imported into the United States in the mid-20th century. ""We don't want perfection. Consistency, yes. But we want to be as diverse as possible."" The Armagnac region grows grapes similar to those used to Cognac (ugni blanc, folle blanche, colombard) with one key exception: baco, a hybrid of folle blanche and the North American grape noah, created in the late 19th century to withstand the phylloxera plague. Hybrid grapes are not permitted in Europe, and in 2010, the European Union tried to ban baco. Armagnac producers won the right to retain their beloved hybrid, which many believe is the secret to long-aged Armagnac. ""As a grape, baco is like an American muscle car,"" Mr. Palazzi said. ""It can withstand years and years of oak."" The idea of educating American drinkers often strikes people in Armagnac as funny. ""It's important to educate people,"" said Armin Grassa, whose family owns Tariquet, one of the largest independent Armagnac houses. ""But not too many people should discover Armagnac. Because, after all, we don't really have enough.""

The entire region of Armagnac sells about six million bottles per year worldwide. Compare that with Cognac, which annually sells around 160 million bottles worldwide, more than 60 million in the United States. More than 90 percent of the Cognac sold on the American market comes from one of four major brands: Hennessy, Courvoisier, Remy Martin and Martell. Mr. Palazzi, who imports both Cognac and Armagnac, insists that Armagnac is easier to sell. ""With Cognac, we have to deconstruct the existing knowledge, then build it back up,"" he said. ""With Armagnac, we build on an absence of knowledge."" With its long aging process, it's no surprise that Armagnac appeals to the sort of drinker who already enjoys bourbon and rye. ""Brandy is hot right now,"" said Tommy Tardie, the owner of Fine & Rare. Though brandies traditionally hover around 40 percent alcohol by volume, higher-proof ""cask-strength"" Armagnac offerings (often 45 to 50 percent A.B.V.) -- similar to those bottlings that whiskey lovers seek out -- are on the rise. ""The whiskey drinker, the single-malt drinker, they're now branching out into brandies, and they want the higher proof,"" said Christine Cooney, the owner of Heavenly Spirits in Lakeville, Mass., the nation's largest importer of the spirit, including top labels such as Delord and Dartigalongue. As bourbon prices skyrocket, brandy is starting to look more and more attractive. That's not to say that Armagnac prices can't still be a shock. The best vintage, single-cask bottles can run more than $200. But it's easy to find good XO -- Armagnac aged for at least six years -- from $50 to $60. Almost all houses in Armagnac produce XOs that are at least 10 years old, or older. ""In Cognac, you'd never be able to find this value,"" Ms. Cooney said.","As interest in Cognac's rustic, lesser-known cousin grows, Armagnac importers must instruct bartenders how to sell it.",83ab7bc7-f1b7-5857-8622-581f5d18eb37,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/dining/20armagnac1/20armagnac1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3c7046d83b0fddb47db56e11009af116ef96c4fb7967441d6f69aeb962bba320&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fine &amp; Rare, a restaurant and bar in Midtown Manhattan, recently held an Armagnac tasting to educate its servers and bartenders about the lesser-known French brandy.",83ab7bc7-f1b7-5857-8622-581f5d18eb37,N24News/imgs/83ab7bc7-f1b7-5857-8622-581f5d18eb37.jpg,17
Science,This Creature Eats Stone. Sand Comes Out the Other End.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/18/science/shipworm-rocks-sand.html,"Lithoredo abatanica is an organism with an unusual appetite: This creature eats stone. And when it excretes, what comes out is sand, the leftovers of a still-mysterious digestion process.

The mollusk, unearthed from the bottom of a river in the Philippines, was introduced this week by an international group of scientists in Proceedings of the Royal Society B. It is a shipworm, a group of burrowing animals related to clams, but so different from known examples that it is both a new species and genus.

Shipworms are usually known for their habit of eating wood. It's right there in the name: They use their shells, attached to one end of their bodies, as chewing devices to burrow into and consume ship bottoms, docks and any other submerged wood . The behavior has made them the plague of mariners past and present, and in recent times, they have even sampled the delights of at least one New York City pier.

Wood-eating shipworms fascinate scientists because they digest pulverized wood with the help of symbiotic bacteria that live in their gills. The bacteria manufacture an array of enzymes and other substances, and studying them and finding new shipworms may prove helpful in the search for new antibiotics, a subject of interest to the scientists behind the new paper.","Shipworms are known for boring into wood and digesting it, but scientists found a new species with a very different diet.",95a6be38-a228-5de4-8d29-80ea83688836,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/02/science/18tb-shipworm1/18tb-shipworm1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=90a4a356a22595fd8e2f2f5b7f8346a2d9d23bb2ad0d377edd87138aaafca2c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A microscopy image of a nearly four-inch-long Lithoredo abatanica shipworm.,95a6be38-a228-5de4-8d29-80ea83688836,N24News/imgs/95a6be38-a228-5de4-8d29-80ea83688836.jpg,2

When Corey Patterson heard about the terrorist attacks in Brussels last week, he had a clear-cut response to people who asked if he was going to cancel a coming trip to Belgium. ""That's exactly what the terrorists want, so absolutely not,"" Mr. Patterson, 45, said on Twitter. He's in the Netherlands now, visiting a former roommate and his family, and will head to Belgium in a few days. ""Anything can happen anywhere at any time,"" Mr. Patterson, a Texas resident, said through messages on Twitter. ""You can't stop living life, and this world is worth seeing, so I chose to do it."" ""Americans especially seem to be fairly resilient and do not panic and cancel trips, unless perhaps they are traveling in the next few days,"" Jennifer Michels Jones, vice president of communications for the American Society of Travel Agents, said in an email.

After the attacks in Paris last fall, 64 percent of the association's agents found that their clients did not plan to delay or cancel travel to and from or within Europe. The travel alerts issued by the State Department also fall far short of advising people to cancel their plans. ""We're not saying, 'Don't travel,' especially not to Europe, but we are saying, 'Be careful if you do,'"" said Michelle Bernier-Toth, the managing director of the federal Office of Overseas Citizens Services. Here are seven ways to take care when traveling to Europe, or really, anywhere. Enrolling in the Smart Traveler Enrollment Program gives the government the ability to send email alerts to a traveler about potential problems, like demonstrations. ""And it gives us a general idea of how many U.S. citizens might be in a country,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said.

2. Know how to contact the American Embassy. Embassy information is available on the government's travel website. Use the search box to pull up information about an individual country. The first pull-down menu lists all the embassy information. Heading to Belgium? The number: 32-2- 811-4000. ""Knowing how to get ahold of us is important,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. ""In the event of a major event, we will work as quickly as possible to identify people who need our assistance and do what we can to help."" 3. Find out how to contact local authorities in case of an emergency. On the page opened in Step 2, each country's equivalent to ""911"" is listed, as well. Britain's equivalent is 999. In France, it's 112. In Belgium, it's 101 if it requires the police, or 112 for everything else. This information is under the ""Safety and Security"" pull-down menu, though not usually at the top. 4. Those phone numbers are only useful for working phones. Your phone plan may not work abroad. Most carriers offer international plans, and they may be expensive. There are alternatives, like renting a phone or buying a SIM card locally. ""It's very useful to have an international SIM card,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. Phones may have to be unlocked, which you can ask your carrier to do. But if something does happen, the number of people trying to make phone calls around the same time can overwhelm phone lines. ""But often text messages will go through,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. Social media sites, like Facebook, and free messaging services, like WhatsApp or WeChat, are alternatives, too. 5. Be vigilant when in public places and using mass transit. ""I don't think you can avoid using mass transit, but be smart about that,"" Ms. Bernier-Toth said. ""Know the exit strategy."" The same applies to major tourist attractions, sporting events, restaurants and other crowded areas.","American tourists seem unfazed by recent terror attacks, but travel experts do suggest some basic precautions.",dfcf9f9a-3459-5c48-8ea5-ebd7fb70187d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/31/travel/31xp-travelsafe/31xp-travelsafe-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=cc89d9fa87f45597be589a06d96e9f84dd9633fb2793be6a6e5ddc0848ccb36d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Travelers at Kennedy International Airport in March.

Economy,"Fed Keeps Interest Rates Near Zero, but Says Economic Indicators Remain Strong",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/29/business/economy/fed-interest-rates.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve wants to make sure that investors understand that it could raise its benchmark interest rate in December; it just is not ready to make any promises yet. The Fed said on Wednesday, after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, that it would keep rates near zero for now, as expected, but it added an unusually explicit statement that it would consider raising rates at its final meeting of the year in mid-December. Fed officials are struggling to decide whether the economy can tolerate higher interest rates, as growth continues to wobble along rather than power ahead on a clear upward path.

""Everything will come down to the incoming data between now and mid-December,"" Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics, said on Wednesday after the Fed revealed its latest thinking. The Fed's message appeared to make an impression on investors who had written off the chances of a December liftoff. The yield on two-year Treasuries, which is closely tied to interest rate expectations, rose to 0.707 percent Wednesday from 0.617 percent Tuesday. Equity indexes dropped sharply after the Fed issued its statement at 2 p.m. but then made up the lost ground and then some. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.18 percent to 2,090.35 on the day. The odds of a December rate increase, derived from asset prices, rose from about 1 in 3 before the meeting to about 1 in 2 by the end of the day. But some investors remained skeptical that the Fed would act, noting that it has been reliably overconfident in its economic forecasts.

""The Fed wants us to believe that it did not go in June and September, when the economy had a stronger pulse than it does now, but it is really seriously considering December,"" the French bank BNP Paribas said in a note to clients. ""We don't believe Chair Yellen will go along with this in the end,"" it continued, referring to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen.

The Fed's decision to delay liftoff until at least mid-December means that short-term rates will remain near zero for a seventh full year. By keeping rates so low, the Fed is encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, which it hopes will translate into faster economic growth. Raising rates, conversely, is likely to weigh on growth by increasing the cost of borrowing. Wednesday's decision was supported by nine of the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, voted to raise rates, as he did in September. The looming question now is whether the Fed will raise rates at its final meeting of the year, scheduled for Dec. 15 and 16. Ms. Yellen and other Fed officials have predicted for years -- and reiterated in recent weeks -- that they expected to start raising rates in 2015. A number of Fed officials have described the decision not to raise rates in September as a close call. Eight of the 12 regional reserve banks voted last month to increase a secondary but symbolic policy rate. And the Fed's statement highlighted the December meeting.

""In determining whether it will be appropriate to raise the target range at its next meeting, the committee will assess progress -- both realized and expected -- toward its objectives of maximum employment and 2 percent inflation,"" the statement said. The previous Fed policy statement did not include the words ""at its next meeting."" The case for raising rates hinges in part on the Fed's forecast that the economy will continue to add jobs at a healthy pace and that inflation will begin to rise more quickly. Moreover, some analysts argue that maintaining near-zero interest rates is now doing more harm than good by encouraging businesses to invest in things like share buybacks to lift their stock price, rather than long-term investments in equipment and developing new products. Fed officials also want to raise rates slowly, to minimize economic disruptions, and starting early could help. The rebound in financial markets after a rocky late summer has removed one obstacle from the Fed's path. In the statement issued after its previous meeting in September, the Fed said global economic and financial developments might restrain domestic growth. That language was stripped from the new statement, leaving only an acknowledgment the Fed ""is monitoring global economic and financial developments."" But the Fed indicated that it was a little more worried about the domestic economy. The statement said ""economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace,"" forgoing the present tense -- ""is expanding"" -- that it used in September. And the Fed specifically said that job growth, a primary focus, had weakened in recent months, although the statement added that officials expect a rebound.","The Federal Reserve's statement, issued after a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee, left open the possibility of a rate increase in December.",27f85122-c9dc-50ef-b5c3-14000f59da13,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/29/business/29fed-web/29fed-web-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=bcaac8ea30ee737b4d26f8c963ab2e61d8ccba49f80f34502394db25142ac9eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Fed's chairwoman, Janet L.

Sports,Dominic Thiem Earns an Australian Open Final With Djokovic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/sports/dominic-thiem-earns-an-australian-open-final-with-djokovic.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- The last moments of Dominic Thiem's stirring win over Alexander Zverev at the Australian Open semifinal were filled not just with brilliance, but promise and possibility. Watching those points, played under intense pressure with the crowd of 15,000 people at Rod Laver Arena whipped into frenzy, it was indeed very possible to imagine Thiem winning this Grand Slam tournament, even against Novak Djokovic, who has been so dominant in Melbourne -- for the past two weeks and the past dozen years. The semifinal was still up for grabs for both players late in a tiebreaker, with Thiem ahead two sets to one. Then it wasn't. On one point, even though he was backpedaling, Thiem nailed a scorching forehand that the 6-foot-6 Zverev could only flail at. On another, Thiem followed his serve with another forehand winner, this time painting the sideline as Zverev admired the shot.

Moments later, on match point, Zverev came to the net and seemed in control. But as he had done all night in this taut affair, Thiem answered perfectly. He hit an arcing lob over his opponent, pushed forward, then clipped off a forehand volley into the open court for the win: 3-6, 6-4, 7-6 (3), 7-6 (4). It took 3 hours 42 minutes, a marathon that featured side-to-side sprinting from beginning to end. After two failed attempts on the red clay at the French Open, Thiem, a 26-year-old Austrian, will get another chance to win his first major championship when the men's final is played on Sunday night. His opponent, Djokovic, is well-rested, primed, and seemingly unbeatable on Melbourne's sea blue courts. To win, Thiem will have to bottle the brilliant grit he showed not just Friday, but in his four-set win over Rafael Nadal in the quarterfinals.

An upset would be monumental. Djokovic, after all, owns this tournament. He has won seven Australian Open titles, a record in men's tennis. Last year, he handed Nadal one of the most thorough beatdowns of the Spaniard's career, controlling play from the first point to the last in a win in straight sets. Djokovic has said it was the greatest performance in a final he has ever played. ""At this level, under these circumstances, it was truly a perfect match,"" he said. There has been nothing different about him this January. Djokovic looks lithe and supremely fit, all recovered from the shoulder injury that forced him to retire during the fourth round of the United States Open last September. The Serbian has been hitting all of his strokes -- backhands, forehands, volleys -- as solidly as we've come to expect over the extraordinary arc of his 16 Grand Slam wins, the last of which came in an epic, Wimbledon final in July against Roger Federer that lasted nearly five hours. Here, remarkably, he actually seems better. His first serve is going in at roughly 70 percent, and he has won 80 percent of those points. It is more than those statistics that point to the unyielding consistency that make Djokovic so dangerous. It is the renewed heft behind his serves. All tournament long, they have sounded different, more resounding, booming across the rafters of the arena. On Thursday, against Federer in a semifinal, Djokovic found himself behind in the first set. Then he leaned on that serve: A booming ace; a series of slices wide and forceful fastballs. The Serbian was storming back, Federer was on his heels. It ended as so many Djokovic matches do. He was a runaway train. ""I have to risk a lot,"" said Thiem, alluding to the aggressive way he has to play, same as in those last, heart-pounding moments against Zverev. ""I have to go for many shots. At the same time, not too much. That's a very thin line.""

Thiem did that the last time they played, when he took out Djokovic in a third-set tiebreaker at the ATP Finals in London last November. It followed another win over the Serbian, last summer, during Thiem's march to the finals at Roland Garros in Paris. Thiem knows how to beat Djokovic -- he has done so four times in 10 tries. The key is sticking close then prevailing deep into each set, and having deep belief. That he should have. Not just from his play in Melbourne. Since the French Open finals defeats at the hands of Nadal in 2018 and 2019, Thiem has taken his game to another level. For most of his career, Thiem was known mostly as a powerful clay courter. But last year he sharpened his game on hardcourts, playing with a well-honed aggression, winning at Indian Wells and making the finals in London. The evolution of his game may well have turned him into what many in tennis had long predicted: the player from his generation most likely to rise through the ranks and challenge the so-called Big Three -- Federer, Nadal and Djokovic -- the trio of legends now in their 30s, who have kept Thiem and others in their mid- and early-20s from winning even a single major title. The Big Three have won 55 of the last 66 major titles. Men's tennis has not had a first-time Grand Slam winner since Marin Cilic took the U.S. Open in 2014. The Serbian knows what he is facing. Thiem ""definitely has the game,"" Djokovic said, not long after beating Federer here on Thursday. ""He has the experience now. He has the strength. He has all the means to really be there. He has improved in the last 12 months playing on the hardcourt without a doubt, and the results are showing that. It's just a matter of one match here and there that can potentially give him a Grand Slam title, that he can actually get in the mix of top three in the world.""","Thiem, who has been on the heels of the Big Three in men's tennis, beat Alexander Zverev in four taut sets to go to the final.",6b3ec01e-a939-5c23-a3fb-9446aae9698f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/31/sports/31tennis-menWEB2/31tennis-menWEB2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=31f1a06669db4d263c162fffe197d030d99970fc525a40f17fb63947bdbce317&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dominic Thiem celebrated his win over Alexander Zverev.,6b3ec01e-a939-5c23-a3fb-9446aae9698f,N24News/imgs/6b3ec01e-a939-5c23-a3fb-9446aae9698f.jpg,9

Theater,Review: Girls Just Wanna Play 'Mac Beth',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/theater/mac-beth-review.html,"Candy jewelry. Some baby dolls. A stash of tampons. In the world of adolescent girls, items like these are ordinary features of the landscape. And so they are in Erica Schmidt's bloody ""Mac Beth,"" an adaptation of the Shakespeare play that with its all-female cast becomes a raucous, sometimes impish, very dark-edged revel.

Yes, revel. To the seven teenagers in ""Mac Beth"" (two words), performing ""Macbeth"" (one word) is something to do for fun. Bringing all their exuberant energy, they gather late in the day in an abandoned lot, still wearing school uniforms. Dropping their backpacks on the scrubby grass, they get right to it, enacting the Scottish tragedy. Unbeknown to the others, a few of them plan to add a grisly, real-life twist.

Mr. Sirota, who also composes musicals, even began working on one inspired by the Frankenstein story. ""The message is that everyone deserves a chance at love,"" he said of his interpretation. ""You have to go find it and nurture it but it's something people are entitled to, and it makes them better people.""

His own search for love was an endurance test: He estimated that in the 1980s and early '90s, before internet dating sites even existed, he went on 110 dates, most of them blind and so uninteresting, he thought about science experiments during them.

""I wanted someone who was exactly like me, who thought like me,"" said Mr. Sirota, 58. ""I now know that would be easier, but incomplete.""

Music,Ric Ocasek's Essential Songs: Listen to 11 Tracks,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/arts/music/ric-ocasek-cars-playlist.html,"Ric Ocasek was a versatile singer, songwriter, guitarist, keyboardist and producer with a vast array of interests, from high art to lowbrow trash. Few rock stars succeeded so well at sliding fringe ideas and sounds into the popular mainstream. His heyday ran from the Cars' 1978 debut until the late 1980s, when the band broke up and Ocasek focused on being a producer and helping new bands find their sound. His increasingly rare solo albums felt indifferent until 2011, when he reformed the Cars (minus Benjamin Orr, who died in 2000) to compete with a new generation of bands influenced by the Cars' sleek brand of social alienation. Here are 11 of his essential songs.

When the first Cars album came out, Ocasek was already in his thirties, a veteran of several also-ran Boston bands. The most important skill he'd learned was concision: The first two Cars albums have an almost Motown-like sense of efficiency and purpose. The name of their self-titled debut's opening track dates back to R&B romps of the '40s and '50s, but as usual, Ocasek's goal was to undermine a familiar conceit. ""Let them brush your rock 'n' roll hair,"" he sings in this steely song about insouciance. And with ""If the illusion is real, let them give you a ride,"" he foresaw everything to come in the 1980s.

The group's debut single, which has been made ubiquitous by its use in Circuit City ads, established a trademark sound based around Ocasek's clicky, eighth-note rhythm guitar parts. This dynamic track, sung by the bassist Benjamin Orr, who had a smoother voice, opens with a guitar lick Ocasek nicked from the Ohio Express' 1968 bubble gum hit ""Yummy Yummy Yummy,"" a song that was big when Ocasek and Orr met in Cleveland in the mid-60s. The Cars, 'It's All I Can Do' (1979)

Ocasek wrote about love with an outsider's skeptical view, and he liked to hide dark or funny ideas in songs that seemed as romantic as prom themes. ""When I was crazy, I thought you were great,"" Orr sings on this track from ""Candy-O,"" giving Ocasek's lyrics a knowing, stoic delivery. The Queen producer Roy Thomas Baker makes the song gleam, and the riff genius Greg Hawkes brightens the track with skittering synthesizer chorus hooks.

This stomping track opens with a typically biting but melodic guitar solo from Elliot Easton, who propels it through an action-packed, under-three-minute length. Ocasek sounds agitated about his puzzling love life, which he sums up at the end of a final verse with a question for his devious partner: ""How can I hold you when you're waving goodbye-bye?""

The Cars were one of the few American new wave acts that could fill arenas. But Ocasek was drawn to musical extremes (""I loved the Velvet Underground and the Carpenters,"" he once said), and he championed the confrontational New York electronic-terror duo Suicide by producing their second album and perversely anointing them as the Cars' opening act -- each night, hostile fans pelted Suicide with garbage. Suicide's influence is also obvious on the Cars' frosty third album, ""Panorama,"" and ""Misfit Kid,"" about a rebel who baffles even himself, might be Ocasek's ode to the notorious duo. The Cars, 'I'm Not the One' (1981)

After the commercial failure of ""Panorama,"" the Cars retrenched on their next album, ""Shake It Up,"" though they couldn't recover the melodic inspiration of their flawless first two records. Years later, Ocasek even renounced the album's title song, calling the lyrics ""crap."" But ""I'm Not the One"" is one of his best melancholy ballads, and Easton's spectacular guitar fills accent the melody like he's channeling George Harrison.

Ocasek wanted Boston to have its own version of Andy Warhol's Factory, so the Cars built a state-of-the-art recording studio on Newbury Street, where local bands could record at under-market rates. Then he brought the San Francisco band Romeo Void to Boston, and co-produced their four-song ""Never Say Never"" EP. On the kinetic, not-safe-for-work dance track ""Never Say Never,"" the singer Debora Iyall sneers at an admirer, while the orderly bass guitar and the chaotic saxophone fight for domination.

They'd drifted away from the mainstream, but in 1984, one of pop music's greatest years, the Cars released an album with five hit singles, making them bigger than ever. The creamy ballad ""Drive,"" crooned by Orr, hides sinister feelings inside a romantic facade: ""Who's going to plug their ears when you scream?"" indeed. Working with a new producer, Mutt Lange, a controlling taskmaster, exhausted the group and left them estranged. Though ""Drive"" went to No. 3, the end was near.

Some of the songs on the meandering pre-breakup album ""Door to Door"" had been around for years, but never seemed good enough to record. On the bustling ""Leave or Stay,"" which had been the Cars' frequent opening song 10 years earlier as a Boston club band, Ocasek returns to a sour vision of love he'd grown away from: ""Well, I could leave or stay/Makes no difference either way.""","The Cars' co-founder, who had a gift for coating clever ideas in radio-friendly rock, has died at 75.",a47d3518-bc9a-517c-ae73-76768f6baa5c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/arts/16ocasek-playlist/16ocasek-playlist-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=5b4dbc0800421c7094a91e31b8818af2a9d0fe5a656fe4520304b3b8b6e46b8b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ric Ocasek brought his various interests into the music he made with the Cars and the groups he produced outside the band.,a47d3518-bc9a-517c-ae73-76768f6baa5c,N24News/imgs/a47d3518-bc9a-517c-ae73-76768f6baa5c.jpg,12
Opinion,The Last Days of the Tech Emperors?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/opinion/sunday/tech-congress-hearings-facebook.html,"On Wednesday, Representative David Cicilline, Democrat of Rhode Island and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust subcommittee, opened a half-virtual hearing on ""Online Platforms and Market Power"" with a combative opening statement: ""Our founders would not bow before a king. Nor should we bow before the emperors of the online economy."" That set the tone for the hours of sharp questioning of four of the wealthiest people on the planet: Jeff Bezos of Amazon, Tim Cook of Apple, Sundar Pichai of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, whose companies have a combined market value roughly equivalent to the G.D.P. of Japan. Given the history of Silicon Valley's relationship with Washington, the intensity and precision of some subcommittee members' questions were remarkable. It is a sign that significant tech regulation may be closer than we think. Despite its techno-libertarian image, the tech industry has had close political ties for decades and remarkable success in getting what it wants.

In the late 1970s, venture capitalists and semiconductor chief executives got Capitol Hill and the Carter White House to agree to tax cuts and looser financial regulations. In the 1980s, a group of young legislators became such boosters of the industry that they were known as ""Atari Democrats."" Ronald Reagan extolled Silicon Valley entrepreneurship and helped tech companies fend off Japanese competition. The bipartisan love affair intensified in the 1990s as Bill Clinton and Al Gore invited tech executives to shape early internet-era policymaking. Newt Gingrich, then the Republican speaker of the House, talked up cyberspace and formed close alliances with libertarian-minded tech thinkers. His party's leaders convened ""high-tech summits"" on Capitol Hill. The lightly regulated online economy we have today is a product of that decade, when Silicon Valley leaders persuaded starry-eyed lawmakers that young, scrappy internet companies could regulate themselves. Washington's embrace of tech continued even as questions emerged about the industry's wealth and power. A 2013 Senate hearing to interrogate Mr. Cook about Apple's tax avoidance quickly was sidetracked by lawmakers gushing to the chief executive about his company's innovative products. Mr. Pichai faced tough questions at a 2018 House Judiciary hearing, but also was showered with praise. ""Google is still the story of the American dream,"" declared Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, the committee's chairman at the time.

Those days seemed a dim memory Wednesday. Instead, the mood recalled the traffic safety debates of the mid-1960s that helped catalyze significantly more regulation for the auto industry. After a steady drumbeat of studies and some short-lived congressional inquiries, traffic safety exploded into the public consciousness starting with Senate hearings in the summer of 1965, where top auto executives faced sharp questions about their lax approach to safety. The evening network news programs showed Robert F. Kennedy, a newly elected senator from New York, grilling the leaders of General Motors about the tiny amount the company spent on safety research. Later that year a young lawyer advising the Senate committee, Ralph Nader, published a blockbuster expose of the industry, ""Unsafe at Any Speed."" This combination of political and media scrutiny led to passage of the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, which mandated seatbelts and additional car safety features, as well as road improvements like guardrails and traffic barriers. Wednesday felt like Big Tech's Ralph Nader moment: the pointed questioning by committee members, notably its Democratic women like Representatives Val Demings of Florida, Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Lucy McBath of Georgia and Mary Gay Scanlon of Pennsylvania; the crescendo of investigative journalism that, in part, led to this week's hearing by shining a critical light on Big Tech's practices. And now, this House subcommittee is merely one of several legislative or regulatory bodies considering limits on Big Tech's power.

""It appears to me,"" Mr. Bezos observed, ""that social media is a nuance-destruction machine, and I don't think that's helpful for a democracy."" (Mr. Zuckerberg's reaction to that statement sadly was not visible to the audience.) Large tech companies also have prepared for the regulatory onslaught by starting some of the most well-funded lobbying operations in Washington. They learned a lesson from Microsoft, whose presence in the capital before its antitrust case in 1998 consisted of one employee who worked out of the back of his car because he lacked proper office space. Although the trial didn't end with Microsoft being ordered to break itself apart, it taught the company that government regulators needed to be taken seriously. And as a result Microsoft tamped down its most aggressive market practices, and escaped much of the yearslong policy scrutiny now facing its peers. Then there is the sticky problem of public opinion. During other seminal moments -- carmakers in the 1960s, tobacco in the 1990s -- the problems posed by unregulated bigness were clear-cut. Cigarettes killed people. Cars were unsafe. Tech's consumer dangers are harder to see and acutely feel on an average day: misinformation, an incomplete search result, an unfairly promoted link, privacy erosion, a skewed algorithm. We may wish we used our smartphones less, or worry about what overuse of social media is doing to our communities and brains. But we still routinely check our Facebook pages, buy apps via Apple, and click ""buy"" on Amazon Prime. Even if, as some representatives noted, we do so because we have little alternative. What happens next will depend on many things, including the November election. But this week marks the end of Washington's great love affair with tech, one that helped make these companies' bigness possible in the first place.","Congress was once filled with ""Atari Democrats.""

Dance,History Is About to Change at New York City Ballet. How?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/02/arts/dance/peter-martins-city-ballet-balanchine.html,"George Balanchine with a dancer backstage during New York City Ballet's Stravinsky Festival in 1972. Peter Martins inherited the duties -- teaching, choreographing, casting, commissioning, supervising, coaching -- that once were Balanchine's.

So Peter Martins, after accusations of sexual harassment and physical and verbal abuse of dancers over decades, has retired from New York City Ballet and the School of American Ballet. An independent investigation of those allegations continues. But this may be the moment to reform the entire job description, and thus to reform ballet. Mr. Martins inherited a remarkable and wide-ranging job model from George Balanchine, who, with Lincoln Kirstein, founded the school in 1934 and City Ballet in 1948. Balanchine began as the company's artistic director but changed his title in the 1950s to ""ballet master"": Ostensibly he was one of several, but ruled with a generally accepted authority that rendered his word as law. Today there are no Balanchines. Is it time to revise the posts that Balanchine filled? Or might this diminish the art form by reducing the scope for creative vision? Mr. Martins has long been the principal inheritor of the power and the duties -- teaching, choreographing, casting, commissioning, supervising, coaching -- that once were Balanchine's. Mr. Martins became one of the company's main ballet masters in 1981; after Balanchine's death in 1983, he began by working in tandem with Jerome Robbins, whose ballets have been part of the company's lifeblood. Soon, however, Mr. Martins took sole command. In 1989, he assumed the title ballet master in chief. (Some Balanchine devotees felt ""in chief"" was excessive.)

It is now almost 35 years since Balanchine died. Nevertheless, City Ballet has remained of singular importance to ballet worldwide. Balanchine has become increasingly recognized as the foremost (and the most influential) choreographer of 20th-century ballet. And while the Balanchine enterprise has spawned companies across America and influenced others around the world, City Ballet and the School of American Ballet have remained central to the Balanchine practice. And under Mr. Martins the company has been the global leader in post-Balanchine choreography. This policy has paid rich dividends in recent years with City Ballet creations by Justin Peck, Alexei Ratmansky and Christopher Wheeldon entering repertories across America and around the world. It's not for me to advocate any heir to Balanchine or Mr. Martins; I strongly dislike the notion of critic as kingmaker or power broker. But when change comes, I must ask: How will the company -- and the art form itself -- be changed, too? If the company is to move forward, several important issues must be considered. Most obviously, a system of checks and balances should be introduced to prevent the abuse of dancers. Harassment within ballet has been reported elsewhere. Let City Ballet now set a global example.

Elsewhere there have been artistic directors of note who neither teach nor choreograph. City Ballet, however, has been a different organism. Would it be changed beyond recognition by such a director? And, of prime concern to dance-goers and dancers alike: Can the company continue in its dual capacity as the world leader in new choreography and the foremost exponent of the Balanchine-Robbins repertory? Since Dec. 9, after Mr. Martins took a leave of absence, the day-to-day artistic direction of City Ballet has been in the hands of an impressively young foursome: Craig Hall and Rebecca Krohn (ballet masters), Mr. Peck and Jonathan Stafford (a former principal now on the school's faculty). The company also has an executive director, Katherine E. Brown, who runs business matters, reporting directly to the board. (The post was created for her in 2009.) How now to move forward? For weeks, people on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter have proposed candidates that include men and women, people of various races and sexual orientations. Please note, though, how few of them fulfill the multiple roles of the Balanchine-Martins model. The old creative ballet-master practice has been largely eroded. (Not entirely: Helgi Tomasson at San Francisco Ballet and Ib Andersen at Ballet Arizona -- City Ballet alumni -- are both artistic directors who choreograph, teach and coach.) Balanchine didn't invent the notion of a directing ballet master -- the teacher who made ballets and controlled policy. It went back to at least the 18th century. (Its 19th-century exemplars included August Bournonville and Marius Petipa.) For Balanchine, like masters before him, a company's dancers had to be custom-trained by its school. And the choreographer who made the ballets had to keep developing his style by teaching, often daily, in the classroom, which became a kind of laboratory. If City Ballet is run by a person who neither teaches nor choreographs, it will move far in spirit from the Balanchine-Kirstein principle. Certainly this may well be the moment for greater artistic separation between the company and the school -- and yet that's easier said than done, since no company depends more on works, by Balanchine and others, in which students of several ages dance.

We live in post-Balanchine times. ""Ballet is woman,"" he said -- but his kind of ballet was always a man's view of woman, and a solely heterosexual one. Though the Balanchine worldview made women empowered and inspiring, it did not include women's equality in the workplace or same-sex relationships. Balanchine brought many women to the top, and yet neither he nor Kirstein considered one to be his successor. When alive, Balanchine was controversial, not least in the demands he placed on his female dancers. Seemingly unstoppable, he transformed his art. And today, many of the teachers and choreographers influenced by him -- including the team now at City Ballet's helm -- either never met him or were born after his time. It was Kirstein who labored to ensure the school and the company would outlive Balanchine. Conversely, Balanchine expressed no confidence that they would, at least on any scale of consequence. Some of his devotees, lastingly despondent about his legacy, still insist either that the flame died with him or that it passed elsewhere. Of the company after his death, Balanchine remarked, ""Apres moi, le board."" Now the boards of the company and the school are faced with big decisions about replacing Mr. Martins. Yet these very boards retained him after the first serious complaints were made against him in the last century. Who knew what and for how long? Let nobody -- the boards, critics, other interested parties -- rush into promoting their special favorites or pursuing their own agendas. The responsibility of redirecting City Ballet is both considerable and complex. Let the thoughts percolate. History is about to change -- but how?",Peter Martins inherited George Balanchine's roles: running the School of American Ballet and City Ballet and choreographing.

Fashion & Style,Gucci's 70 Shades of Renaissance,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/25/fashion/milan-fashion-week-gucci.html,"MILAN -- It began with some boosterism and a success story; with lobster and lamb's lettuce and lots of chiffon. Political power met economic power in a tag-team display of mutual appreciation as the big guns came out for the first day of Milan Fashion Week. Then Alessandro Michele, the creative director of Gucci, put some silk poppies on top. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi of Italy flew in for an opening lunch, the first time the head of government had done so. In the shadow of the Duomo here, in a room festooned with urns of ivy and goblets of kumquats, Marco Bizzarri, the chief executive of Gucci, hobnobbed with Pietro Beccari, chief executive of Fendi, and with Stefano Sassi, chief executive of Valentino. Diego Della Valle, chairman of Tod's Group, schmoozed with Patrizio Bertelli, co-chief executive and executive director of Prada Group.

And Donatella Versace, in an olive-green suit (sans shirt) and diamonds, got ready to make her toast. Everyone was there except Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce, who apparently had said they were preparing their show.

""The message we can convey together is that this country is dusting off its past,"" the prime minister said from his podium, after some pasta. ""Italy should be a workshop, not a museum."" His audience clapped, and then hied their way to Gucci, the first big show of the week, where Mr. Michele illustrated Mr. Renzi's words by marrying the Renaissance to -- well, everything.

""It's rock 'n' roll Renaissance, 1980s Renaissance, street-style Renaissance, bourgeois Renaissance, chinoiserie Renaissance,"" he said backstage. (His show notes said it a little more opaquely, referencing the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari and their ""rhizomatic'' system of thought, but the idea was broadly the same.) In practice, that meant long, ostrich-trimmed gowns and short studded leather suits; big shoulders and puffed shoulders; fur trim and fur cuffs; putti prints and giant shaggy furs; hostess dresses with fluted sleeves and one with AC/DC sequined on the back.

It meant red, white and blue sporty jersey sheaths embroidered with Edwardian diamond necklaces, and cracked-leather baseball jackets with double G's graffitied behind. And it meant more (70 exits' worth), just as there was in Mr. Michele's last show and the one before that: a bricolage of muchness that has become his signature.

You can understand the repetition: Sales in the fourth quarter of 2015 were Gucci's best in three years, and seemingly every week, one celebrity or another shows up in one of last season's dresses. (Thank goodness they will now have something new to wear.) It's clearly working; why mess with a good thing? Because this is fashion, which is driven by the next thing. There is comfort in familiarity, of course, and in beauty, and Mr. Michele's work now has both, but the one thing missing thus far has been a certain rigor -- with his own thinking, and with his talent. One that distills instead of decorates. ""We are hungry for the future,"" Mr. Renzi said at his lunch, and the same can be said of Gucci under Mr. Michele. He has set a direction; now he needs to go forward with it.","After lunch hosted by Italy's prime minister, fashion week opened to Alessandro Michele's signature smorgasbord: filling, but not entirely satisfying.",31638d0b-5e47-538e-8096-d06a498fff92,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/24/fashion/25GUCCI-web01/25GUCCI-web01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=1c6e5aa620b74a1c95827ee3ca65a1ba87ad483841b5d82c5ac2306f2194a4e8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Backstage at Gucci, the Renaissance was mixed with the '80s, chinoiserie, rock 'n' roll and more.",31638d0b-5e47-538e-8096-d06a498fff92,N24News/imgs/31638d0b-5e47-538e-8096-d06a498fff92.jpg,19

Real Estate,House Hunting in … Anguilla,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/29/realestate/house-hunting-in-anguilla.html,"A Five-Bedroom House on the Coast of Anguilla This Mediterranean-style house, known as Villa Amarilla, was built by its owners in 2008 on a rocky foreshore of the 35-square-mile Caribbean island of Anguilla. The five-bedroom house, which has five full and two half bathrooms, is on a half-acre lot, with a separate cottage and a pool terrace. Italian influences are evident in the yellow stucco walls and red tile roof. A bougainvillea-draped pergola shades the wrought-iron-and-glass double front door, with the sea visible beyond the entrance hall, through three sets of floor-to-ceiling French doors along the back wall of the living room. ""You can see the view even before you enter the house,"" said Leslie el-Effendi, one of the home's eight owners. Numerous French and sliding doors, terraces and a terra-cotta-tiled balcony stretching across the back of the two-story house also offer panoramic vistas. Inside, the house has a ""Moroccan flair,"" Ms. el-Effendi said. Beneath the entry hall's vaulted ceiling, squares of bright blue porcelain tile on the floor are crisscrossed with wood-grained ceramic planks, a motif that extends to the living room, which has a coffered ceiling with exposed beams.

On the other side of the entrance hall is a media room with arched windows and a master bedroom with a dressing area and a colorfully tiled en suite bathroom with dual vanities, a private commode and indoor and outdoor showers. Twin staircases flank the entry hall, leading up to four bedrooms, each with an en suite bathroom and walk-in closet, as well as access to a central balcony. The easternmost and westernmost bedrooms have outdoor showers and private balconies. All of the furniture comes with the house, Ms. el-Effendi said, including the coral-laden chandeliers and sconces and the white Chinese Chippendale dining set.

The home has 16 air-conditioners and a full-house generator. Windows and doors are equipped with impact glass. Last year, the house survived Hurricane Irma unscathed, although the landscaping needed some touch-ups, said Wicky el-Effendi, an owner. An outdoor kitchen on the terrace has a bar and a barbecue. Cushioned seating areas occupy the two outer corners of the terrace. ""That is usually where we are at sunset,"" Leslie el-Effendi said. The heated infinity saltwater pool has tiled lounges and a spa. A balustrade surrounding the terrace continues down a double staircase to the lawn overlooking the sea. There is also a laundry room with a separate entrance from the driveway and a stand-alone cottage with a gym and a full bathroom. The house is about a five-minute drive to the white-sand beach at Shoal Bay East and is within walking of Island Harbour, a ""picturesque fishing village"" known for ""beach bars and more elegant restaurants,"" as well as an ice-cream shop that rents kayaks, said Scott Hauser, the owner of Anguilla Properties Sotheby's International Realty, which has the listing. Most Americans fly into the neighboring island of St. Maarten and take the 20-minute boat ride from a pier near Princess Juliana International Airport, Mr. Hauser said. The home is a 20-minute drive from the Blowing Point ferry terminal on Anguilla and 15 minutes from Clayton J. Lloyd International Airport, used by small private planes and island hoppers.

Before Irma, sellers were more reluctant to negotiate prices, he said, noting that the ""bread and butter of the market"" are homes in the $750,000 to $1.5 million range. John Wigley, a lawyer and a manager at Anguilla Realty, said that in some ways Irma ""was a good thing, because people have become more realistic about selling their homes."" Still, he added, some buyers ""have a misconception"" that they can scoop up ""damaged properties quite cheaply."" With most of the island's homes built from concrete, he said, ""it doesn't work like that."" Before 2017, the luxury market was ""quite buoyant,"" drawing ""significant attention, particularly from high net-worth buyers,"" said Robert Cooper, director and editor of 7th Heaven Properties, which specializes in Caribbean real estate. In the wake of Irma, Mr. Cooper said, ""there was a sharp drop in inquiries and home sales."" But in the ""relatively small, high-end real estate market,"" asking prices did not drop significantly. At the top of the market in Anguilla, he said, ""world-class, ultraluxury"" beachfront residences can still sell for as much as $20 million. And in recent years, a few condominium developments have offered buyers ""the opportunity to purchase a slice of this high-end destination through a more modest investment,"" Mr. Cooper said, with ""the added benefits of resort-style amenities and the worries of long-distance ownership removed.""

Since reopening post-Irma in April, one $5.2 million condominium has sold at the 136-unit Four Seasons Resort and Residences Anguilla, with 25 more on the market (43 have sold since 2016, when the Four Seasons rebranded the former Viceroy property). Prices for fully furnished suites, townhouses and villas range from $750,000 for a deluxe studio to $10 million for a 9,500-square-foot, five-bedroom, five-bathroom beachfront home with a pool. When they are not in residence, buyers typically put the homes in a hotel rental program, said Nick Cassini, president of IMI Worldwide Properties, which is marketing the homes with Douglas Elliman. (A $10 million villa typically rents for $6,000 to $8,000 a night, and can fetch as much as $25,000 a night around Christmas.) Though ""comparatively small,"" Anguilla's real estate market is among ""the top tier of Caribbean luxury-property markets,"" Mr. Cooper said, noting that several properties ""offer very high rental income-generating potential, and a track record of hosting world-famous celebrity guests."" Anguilla primarily attracts buyers from the United States and Canada, particularly those who live in the Northeast, with a few from Chicago and Toronto, and some from the United Kingdom and Europe, Mr. Hauser said. Shoal Bay, on the northeast coast, and Meads Bay and Barnes Bay, to the southwest, are ""traditionally popular"" with foreign buyers, Mr. Cooper said. Buyers at the Four Seasons come ""from all over the world,"" Mr. Cassini said, including from Italy, Sweden, England and Canada. Most, however, are from the northeastern United States, with some from Arizona and North Carolina. Foreigners not only buy property in Anguilla for their own use, but also for its potential to generate rental income. The owners of Villa Amarilla, four couples from Texas, frequently rent the property, Ms. el-Effendi said.","After a market slowdown in the wake of Hurricane Irma last year, the Caribbean island is on the rebound, thanks in part to its concrete housing stock.",c3e06376-5649-5ff6-a1d1-07d4428ebcdc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/realestate/02IHH-Anguilla-slide-ILT9/02IHH-Anguilla-slide-ILT9-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=dde8d5e37816bc8d035715ca9f8581aeba62d511eba688ba996cd4f68b54a9ad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The rear terrace has a dining area, a kitchen with a barbecue and panoramic views.",c3e06376-5649-5ff6-a1d1-07d4428ebcdc,N24News/imgs/c3e06376-5649-5ff6-a1d1-07d4428ebcdc.jpg,7
Real Estate,Bon Voyage to a Gilded Club,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/29/realestate/long-island-in-the-region-bon-voyage-to-a-gilded-club.html,"THE Knickerbocker at Manhasset Bay, the 32-unit age-restricted condominium soon to be built on the Manhasset Bay waterfront here, is to resemble a cruise ship, with tiered levels and curved balconies. The theme harks back to the peninsula's nautical heritage and to the Knickerbocker Yacht Club, which was founded in 1874 and which moved here more than a century ago from the banks of the Harlem River in Manhattan. But three years ago the economic downturn worked to devastating effect. Seemingly bottomless boating budgets were put under strain, and membership waned. The club was sold in 2009 for $3.2 million to Cord Meyer Development, the company that developed Forest Hills, Queens, long ago. Last week demolition began on the Gatsby-esque stucco clubhouse where members sipped cocktails in the barroom, and danced and dined in the grill room. Sal Panico, the president and chief executive officer of Cord Meyer, and Anthony Colletti, its chief operating officer, are not boaters, but said they were drawn to the yacht club's ""beautiful property"" partly by its ""excellent location"" on the waterfront and by the prosperous surrounding community. And there was another factor: the growing number of baby boomers in the area, who are looking to ""maintain a presence in Port Washington but sell their large homes.""

Even though the $20 million project didn't require a variance, it took the developers three years to obtain permits from the Town of North Hempstead. But Mr. Colletti says there are still 60-plus people on a waiting list, including many boaters and former members of the yacht club. The draw is not just nostalgia -- nor is it just the nautical-themed renderings, or the vistas across the bay to Kings Point in the west, Westchester in the north, and marinas in nearby Manorhaven. The lure may also be the boat slip or mooring that comes with each $800,000-to-$1.2 million unit. The condominium will be the only one on the Port Washington waterfront to come with its own moorings and slips -- 22 of the former out in the water, 10 of the latter at dockside. ""That is a separate value,"" Mr. Panico said of the 10 boat slips, which could be worth ""as much as $75,000 to $125,000"" if bought at a marina. Norman Schefer, a real estate developer from Sands Point and a past commodore of the Knickerbocker Club, described the sale as ""a heart-rending thing."" But he cited one potential consolation: many former members, including himself, ""are on the list to buy units."" ""For many of the old-timers that have boats,"" Mr. Schefer said, ""you can live right where your boat is. We are interested in living on the water. They can anchor out and use the waterfront.""

At its height, the Knickerbocker Yacht Club had more than 235 members, including serious sailors, a sprinkling of motor boaters, and some who just liked watching the seascape of sails against the bay from the curved veranda. Others enjoyed the waterfront swimming pool, the tennis facilities and the social life of a club with a restaurant, a bar and grill room with a dance floor, and a private party space. It was in 2007 that membership began to wane. The board voted to shut down when the number reached 115, Mr. Schefer said. Many of the boating members joined the more upper-crust Manhasset Bay Yacht Club next door. Manhasset Bay also took over the signature Knickerbocker Cup race, an international sailing event to be held Aug. 29 to Sept. 2. The Knickerbocker's three tennis courts, across Main Street on Third Avenue, were sold to Daniel Zarabi, a builder, for a total $700,000 in a separate transaction in 2009. Each court became a building lot for a four-bedroom two-and-a-half-bath shingled colonial with dark wood floors, extensive moldings, a covered front porch and backyard deck. The houses are on the market for just under $1.1 million each, said Bonnie Doran of Daniel Gale Sotheby's International Realty, the listing broker. (Ms. Doran, a member of the Manhasset Bay Yacht Club, said she was gunning for a waterfront unit in the new condominium.) In its heyday the Knickerbocker was a year-round draw. In the winter, there was iceboating and dinghy racing, known as frostbiting. In the summer there were regattas against other Long Island yacht clubs. Leisurely cruises were enjoyed on members' boats, which ranged from million-dollar custom yachts to 10-foot dinghies. The condo developers, working with a civic group called Residents for a More Beautiful Port Washington, are creating 15-foot-wide outdoor corridors to provide pedestrian access to the waterfront from Main Street. Daniel D. Donatelli, a president of the civic group, said the developers had ""pledged to donate land"" and work with neighboring restaurants to connect the condominium property to a scenic two-mile-long public walking trail with plantings and benches that follows the curve of the waterfront from the town dock through Baxter Estates to Manorhaven.",The demolition of the Knickerbocker Yacht Club on Manhasset Bay will make way for an age-restricted condominium.,03e36adf-df77-5489-85d8-5652b97f1399,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/29/realestate/29LIZOA_SPAN/29LIZOA_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=0e219961b586472a32c7c2d198fb0922db29ca8c445980d4f1444c183fc150cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Knickerbocker Yacht Club, which looks out at Manhasset Bay, will be demolished.",03e36adf-df77-5489-85d8-5652b97f1399,N24News/imgs/03e36adf-df77-5489-85d8-5652b97f1399.jpg,7
Sports,The Secrets of Pitching's Outlaws,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/sports/baseball/pitching.html,"Credit...Associated Press





The Brooklyn Dodgers met an old friend on a trip to St. Louis early in the 1955 season. Preacher Roe, a sly and slender lefty who had just retired to West Plains, Mo., entertained his former teammates at the Chase Hotel. He needed their advice. ""We sat around a big table, all talking to Preacher,"" recalls Carl Erskine, a top Dodgers starter then. ""He said, 'Fellas, I want to ask you a question: Sports Illustrated has offered me $2,000 to tell them how I threw the spitter. You think I should do that or not? With that $2,000 I can blacktop my driveway and I can fix up my house. I could really use that $2,000. What do you think?' ""The guys all said, 'Yeah, go ahead, Preach, sure, why not?' I did not. I admired Preacher. He was a great study to watch pitch. He was very clever and won a lot of games; he was really a pitcher's pitcher. So I didn't say yes to that. As we were leaving the dining room, Preacher said, 'I didn't hear you speak up.' I said, 'No, I didn't, Preacher. You were such an outstanding pitcher without the spitter, I'd hate to see you taint your whole career by talking about throwing it.' ""So anyway, Preacher did the article, he got the $2,000, and sometime later when I talked to Preach he said, 'Carl, you know what? I just ruined my chances for the Hall of Fame by admitting I threw the spitter, and you're the only one that advised me not to do it.' And I said, 'Well, Preacher, I saw you pitch, you were a pitcher's pitcher. You could have won without the spitter.'""

Maybe, maybe not. While Erskine believed in Roe, the man himself didn't: In his confession, Roe said he turned to the pitch after slumping to 4-15 with the Pirates in 1947. Reviving the spitter, which he had practiced with Harry Brecheen as a Cardinals farmhand, was his last chance. He made the most of it, becoming a regular All-Star, though not quite a Cooperstown candidate, for the Dodgers. Cheating only made sense. ""Why shouldn't I have?"" Roe told Dick Young in the Sports Illustrated article. ""I was about through when I decided to get me the pitch. 'If I get caught,' I told myself, 'they'll kick me out. If I don't, I'm through anyway, so how can I lose?'"" He didn't lose very often. Roe won so much -- he had a .715 winning percentage over seven seasons with Brooklyn -- that he guessed the spitter had earned him $100,000. On the bench between innings, Roe would pop a stick of Beech-Nut gum into his mouth and announce, ""I'm going to get me a new batch of curveballs."" In the game, he'd spit on the meaty part of his thumb while pretending to wipe his brow. Then, while hitching his belt, he'd subtly wipe his index and middle fingers on the saliva. Two wet fingers on top, a dry thumb underneath, and Roe was ready. He compared it to squeezing a peach pit or a watermelon seed with your fingertips.

Roe's confession only confirmed his reputation. As Stan Musial wrote decades later, ""I'd always be first-pitch hitting against Roe, because when he had two strikes on you, he'd usually load up, and I hated to get a shower."" Anticipation of the spitter helped Roe, and he knew how to destroy evidence. He was never caught in the act. ""The umpire would call for the ball, and Preacher would stomp around and look at his hand like, 'Uh-oh, you probably got me this time,'"" Erskine says, ""and then instead of tossing the ball in, he'd roll it to the umpire on the ground!"" Like steroid users decades later, Roe stayed ahead of the cops and thrived. But his pang of regret to Erskine -- at least for going public and bursting his cloud of mystery -- showed that he knew what he had done. The specter of the dark arts would indeed follow Roe to his grave; when he died in 2008, the word ""spitball"" appeared in the headline of his New York Times obituary. After two chaotic decades or so, the spitball was banned for 1920, the same year the country went dry under Prohibition. The rule simply turned the mound into a speakeasy, with many pitchers going undercover to get the same slippery edge as their predecessors. The physics behind the spitball is simple enough: When the ball slides off wet fingers, it loses backspin and therefore rotates less -- something like a knuckleball, which should not rotate at all, or a forkball tumbling in its final plunge. Defacing the surface of a ball produces the same kind of effect -- added movement, to the opposite side of the scuff. This also dates to the game's early days. Imagine what the baseballs looked like in the early 20th century: ""We'd play a whole game with one ball, if it stayed in the park,"" Wahoo Sam Crawford, a Hall of Famer who played from 1899 to 1917, says in ""The Glory of Their Times,"" a book by Lawrence S. Ritter.

Even the possibility of scuffing gives pitchers an edge. These words come from Chet Brewer, a star for the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro National League in the late 1920s, and they sound timeless: ""A cut ball? I got credit for that,"" he told John Holway in the book ""Black Diamonds."" ""If I picked up a rough one, I didn't throw it out of the game. I didn't exactly put the cuts on it myself, but I could pitch it."" Scuffing charges never dogged Mike Mussina, a Hall of Fame right-hander for the Orioles and the Yankees from 1991 to 2008. But like any smart pitcher, he would never reject a ball that came to him with a mark. This was Mussina's order for every catcher: If a ball scrapes the ground, never volunteer it to the umpire. ""Say a guy hits a ground ball to short and they throw it back to me from first base -- as soon as I grab the ball, I'm running my thumb over these,"" Mussina says. He is holding a ball and referring to the white area within the horseshoe. ""Do I have a sinker out of this ball? And if I find one I think's pretty good, I flip it to the other side to see if it's scuffed up on the wrong side."" By that he means the opposite side; if both horseshoe areas are scuffed, they'll counteract each other, to no advantage. If there's a scuff where the seams narrow -- the sweet spot -- it creates a four-seam sinker, a pitch that spins like a straight fastball but veers away, in the direction opposite the scuff. A common lament among retired pitchers is that too many balls are now thrown out of play. To them, it underscores a lack of craftsmanship on the mound. ""I've literally seen teammates, when there's a scuff on the ball they get rid of it,"" says Jamie Moyer, who won 269 games in a career that ended in 2012, the year he turned 50. ""They'll say, 'Oh, it does funny stuff,' and you go, 'Wait a minute, that funny stuff can be a benefit to you!'""

""When I played, a ball hit the dirt, it was still in play,"" says Chili Davis, the Mets hitting coach, who played from 1981 to 1999. ""Today's game, if a catcher throws a ball down to second on a short hop, or a ball gets blocked in the dirt, that ball's out of the game. It's just automatic now."" Pitchers also seek ways to look natural while applying moisture or tackiness to their fingers. One former player, now a broadcaster, reached into his team's ball bag for me and pulled out a canister of colorless Tuf-Skin, a spray that helps secure athletic tape. With one spritz of Tuf-Skin on my arm, I had an invisible island of instant tackiness for my fingers. That's also why pitchers like putting clear BullFrog sunscreen on their arms. Grab the rosin bag, aimlessly touch the BullFrog spot, and you'll have just enough stickiness to help guide your pitches. One catcher says he has seen pitchers leave the dugout between innings and wrap their fingers around a ball coated with pine tar, leaving just enough residue on their hands to get a better grip when they return to the mound. Next time you go to a game, notice all the surfaces a pitcher touches with his hand. Pitchers are fidgety creatures, constantly tugging and swiping and scratching their caps, their sleeves, their skin, something. Corey Kluber, the two-time Cy Young Award winner for Cleveland, grabs his tongue on the mound before every pitch -- which became legal again years ago -- then wipes his hand on the side of his pants.

""The way they rub the balls up now, they rub them up all in advance,"" Kluber says. ""They're not rubbed up all day, and they sit in the bucket with all the dust and stuff, and they get so slippery. Just get a little bit of moisture on your hand, at least. You've still got to wipe it off, obviously, but you get a little bit of moisture on your hand so the ball's not as dry."" Kluber does this no matter the weather, but such tactics are especially handy in the cold and at high altitude, where it's harder to generate moisture. ""I tell you what,"" says one 10-year veteran, ""if they could get a camera behind the dugout in Colorado, it would be like a mad scientist's laboratory down there, people doing anything they can to find a grip."" Most players, even hitters, tend to accept this practice. A pitch can be an instrument of destruction, after all, and a hitter would rather the pitcher know where it's going than accidentally fire a cue ball at his head. It is a fine distinction, to be sure, but this is the logic: Tackiness helps command and finish on a pitch, and that's O.K. Sandpaper or K-Y Jelly helps enhance movement, and that's not.

Pine tar is one thing -- cheating by the letter of the law, yes, but not by the spirit. Whatever happened to the spitball, the Hall of Fame pitch of Jack Chesbro and Ed Walsh, Stan Coveleski and Red Faber, Burleigh Grimes and Gaylord Perry? Richie Ashburn, who had the most hits of the 1950s, always thought of pitchers as shifty characters, never to be trusted. Where have all the scoundrels gone? When I asked Perry in 2018 why more pitchers were not as, shall we say, crafty as they were in his day, he had a short but telling answer: ""Well, maybe they don't need it."" Dan Plesac, who pitched in more than 1,000 games, agreed. ""You're not looking for a Don Sutton now, a guy that can sink it and cut it and make the ball move,"" Plesac says. ""If you don't have velocity, you can't pitch anymore. How many guys, how many real power pitchers, need to scuff the ball to be successful? Not many. You don't need to, if your stuff is that good."" Plesac works for MLB Network, founded in 2009, the hub of baseball's vast and ever-expanding visual empire. Every fan can watch games on the At Bat app. Every team has a bank of video screens, usually just off the dugout, showing every conceivable angle for replays and analysis. Good luck evading the most sophisticated alarm system in baseball history. ""When there's so many TV cameras, it's so hard to get away with it,"" says Jason Giambi, who played 20 seasons in the majors. ""You have so many sets of eyes on these guys, and especially if they see a pitch that looks really abnormal, the (team video analyst) rewinds it 5,000 times: 'O.K., what did he do different? Oh, he went to the side of his pants, he went to his belt, he went to the top of his hat.' Then they start to put together the timeline of every time he's pitched, does that ball do the same thing? What about his last start, his start before that? And before you know it, they've got it down -- all right, go tell the umpire to check his hat, or check the side of his pants, or check inside his glove. You can't hide anymore."" But what if you could? What if the next Preacher Roe or Gaylord Perry was hiding in plain sight on a diamond near you, fiendishly fooling all the viewers and video technicians at the ballpark and beyond? He could blacktop a lot of driveways by selling those secrets -- and he'd probably keep the supplies after finishing the job. The sticky sealant just might come in handy.","Pitchers have used all sorts of tricks to adulterate balls and make their jobs easier.

Aerial view of ""Project: Look Up,"" a moving-art installation by Elizabeth Turk, created with residents of Mt. San Antonio Gardens, a retirement community in Pomona, Calif.

POMONA, Calif. -- Deep within the verdant grounds of the Mt. San Antonio Gardens retirement community, the artist Elizabeth Turk was immersed in her latest project, an ambitious work of art that she could easily imagine but not yet see. ""What do you tell yourself when you face adversity?"" she asked the residents, drawing inspiration for a project that would create hope during the Covid-19 pandemic. With the 31-acre community as her canvas and its 500 residents and staff members as her medium, Ms. Turk envisioned ""a wild garden on steroids"" for a moving-art installation titled ""Project: Look Up.""

""Look Up"" is modeled after her ""Shoreline Project,"" a 2018 commission by the Laguna Art Museum that brought 1,000 volunteers to Laguna Beach at twilight, equipped with specially designed, illuminated umbrellas. Participants interacted as they meandered along the shore while hundreds viewed the spectacle from cliffs overlooking the area. Inspired by the resilience and optimism displayed by residents of the retirement community, Ms. Turk wanted to create an upbeat ""Shoreline""-like experience that would shatter myths of helpless senior citizens. This time, though, the privately funded installation would be closed to the public because of safety concerns. Ms. Turk plans to create a multimedia artwork featuring kaleidoscopic images from drone footage of participants as they move about in several locations across the expansive grounds. When the pandemic hit, Ms. Turk, who resides in New York City and Newport Beach, Calif., was working on plans to re-create ""Shoreline"" in Laos. That project was quickly shelved.

Officials there approached her in July about designing umbrellas for their gift shop. But the discussion quickly turned to the residents, who range in age from 64 to 104. ""It just hit my heart,"" the artist recalled. ""I thought what better community to engage with to remind us of joy and resilience -- vulnerable people leading us back to joy and togetherness."" The Mt. San Antonio Gardens' chief executive, Maureen Beith, was initially hesitant about letting residents participate because of Covid-19, she said. ""But because I knew that something positive was sorely needed, I felt it was important for us to go out on a limb a little bit.""

And so on a crisp November day last week, masked participants gathered, each carrying a colorful umbrella featuring the artist's drawings of plants that symbolize success in the face of adversity. The umbrella width helped encourage social distancing. To make ""Look Up"" more inclusive, the artist arranged to photograph residents who had been unable to participate. Those with mobility issues received a mechanism that allowed umbrellas to be attached to wheelchairs or walkers. In the weeks leading up to the event, residents prepared handwritten responses to Ms. Turk's question about adversity. Sayings such as ""Be brave,"" ""I am a warrior"" and ""Breathe,"" will be incorporated into Ms. Turk's final multimedia artwork.","Elizabeth Turk imagined illuminated umbrellas spreading hope during the pandemic.

Movies,Watch These 12 Underseen Indie Movies on Hulu,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/movies/hulu-indie-movies.html,"Outside of big cities like New York and Los Angeles, many moviegoers don't have access to great independent films until they reach home video, and even those who can see them in theaters don't always take advantage. Hulu has become a steady destination for films from quality distributors like Neon, Magnolia and Bleecker Street; these are 12 titles the streamer is currently carrying that deserve to find an audience. After getting assaulted in his neighborhood, an ineffectual accountant (Jesse Eisenberg) starts taking karate classes at a strip-mall dojo in this dark comedy, which gets darker by the minute as the dojo's violent, alpha-male culture starts to reveal itself. The most obvious point of comparison for ""The Art of Self-Defense"" is ""Fight Club,"" another film about a rogue visionary who builds a philosophy around brutal masculinity. The Brad Pitt role here belongs to an inspired Alessandro Nivola, a sensei who teaches his students to listen to death metal music, kick with their fists and commit the occasional crime after hours. Before wowing Sundance earlier this year with the drama ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always,"" the writer and director Eliza Hittman explored the secret desires of a young man in a hypermasculine environment in this insightful and dreamily realized character piece. Harris Dickinson stars as a Brooklyn teenager who has a girlfriend (Madeline Weinstein) but trolls for older male sexual partners online, carefully keeping this information from his friends while telling himself he's neither gay nor bisexual. ""Beach Rats"" sounds adjacent to ""Moonlight,"" but it has more in common with the specific New York cultural dynamics of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" another film about thrill-seekers who run in packs, always looking for an escape from their dead-end lives.

Wearing its many influences on its sleeve, Jennifer Reeder's candy-colored slice of life movie draws from cult favorites like ""Repo Man,"" ""Suspiria,"" ""Heathers"" and the films of John Hughes. It's something of a feminist twist on ""Twin Peaks,"" spinning out from the disappearance of teenage girl. Reeder does give the audience a glimpse of what happened to her Laura Palmer type, who went missing after denying a jock a sexual favor, but she's equally compelled by what it means to her mother (Marika Engelhardt), a high-school choir teacher, and classmates who are embroiled in their own secret lives. ""Knives and Skin"" doesn't hold together perfectly, but Reeder imagines a Midwest town unlike any other and takes a particularly keen interest in how its girls interact under strange and terrifying circumstances.

The North Dakota border town of Nia DaCosta's ""Little Woods"" is like a working-class variation on the rural Ozarks in ""Winter's Bone,"" with more jobs available in construction, perhaps, but a population equally hooked on opioids. Tessa Thompson plays a reformed drug runner who's late in her probation and eyeing an opportunity for legitimate work in Spokane, Wash., but with the family home nearing foreclosure and her sister (Lily Jones) close to destitution, she unearths a bag of 500 pills she buried and starts selling again. DaCosta, who directed the upcoming remake of ""Candyman,"" grounds her hero's predicament in an austere setting where life is difficult under the best of circumstances and people are always on the precipice of disaster. Lighting a long fuse on issues of race, revolution and the legacy of global conflict, Julius Onah's provocative drama stars the gifted Kelvin Harrison Jr. as an accomplished high-school athlete, debater and scholar who isn't the uncomplicated success story he appears to be. After his history teacher (Octavia Spencer) assigns the class to write a paper from the perspective of a historical figure, he chooses Frantz Fanon, the political philosopher who believed that colonialism could only be toppled by violent revolt. His parents (Tim Roth and Naomi Watts), who adopted him from war-torn Eritrea, don't understand her alarm, but they soon discover that their son hasn't been forthcoming about how he feels and what actions he intends to take.

Not many actors get the opportunity to end their careers like Harry Dean Stanton. ""Lucky,"" a drama tailor-made for Stanton, was his last film in an onscreen career spanning more than six decades; it was released in theaters less than two weeks after he died at 91. Then again, not many actors are as brilliant as Stanton was or as willing to reveal so much of himself that close to the end. Directed by another character actor, John Carroll Lynch, the film is about a 90-year-old Texan who's been cheating death for years but must finally face the inevitable after taking a fall. What might have been a pre-fab tribute to Stanton is deepened by his willingness to show fear and vulnerability, as well as the regret of a loner who doesn't have loved ones to say goodbye. There's a for-fans-only quality to Tim Heidecker's satirical comedy: It's the latest expansion of the ""On Cinema at the Cinema"" universe, a ""Siskel & Ebert""-style movie review show parody that began life as a podcast before breaking as a web series on Thing X and Adult Swim. But even newcomers who don't get all the in-jokes can appreciate ""Mister America"" as an absurdist commentary on a period in politics when unctuous boors felt they were entitled to public service jobs. Heidecker stars as a no-hope independent candidate for district attorney of San Bernardino County, Calif., running mostly to unseat the man who charged him for second-degree murder for hawking tainted vape juice at an EDM festival.

Crystal Moselle made her directorial debut with 2015's ""The Wolfpack,"" a documentary about home-schooled brothers in Manhattan's Lower East Side who learned about the world through movies, which they'd then re-enact at home. ""Skate Kitchen"" is Moselle's graceful transition into features, but she takes a piece of documentaries with her in the film's on-the-fly naturalism and her continued interest in outcasts banding together. Real-life skateboarder Rachelle Vinberg plays a Long Island teenager who befriends a multiracial group of boarders at a New York skate park and stops coming home to her conservative mother. The improvised street scenes in ""Skate Kitchen"" may recall Larry Clark and Harmony Korine's ""Kids,"" but Moselle has a subtler feel for social dynamics and the stolen pleasures of youth. ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) proved that sticking a bunch of great character actors in a warehouse and turning up the heat was a cheap and efficient formula for tense genre film. To that end, the drum-tight thriller ""The Standoff at Sparrow Creek"" is stocked with recognizable faces that may not come with recognizable names -- James Badge Dale, Brian Geraghty and Patrick Fischler are the leads -- but add depth to Henry Dunham's story about militia members hiding out after one of them is accused of shooting up a police funeral. The film's Waco-influenced politics are clouded with ambiguity, but the slow-burn tension is cleanly rendered, with the inevitable spasm of violence reserved for maximum impact.

The spirit of the late Jonathan Demme lives on in Andrew Bujalski's funny and generous slice of Americana, set at a downmarket Hooter's-like ""breastaurant"" called Double Whammies. Regina Hall is wonderful as its general manager, who spends her day dealing with emotionally volatile waitresses, rude customers, a faulty cable-TV connection, an attempted robbery of the office safe and the encroaching threat of a new chain about to open up. Through all this hectic action, Bujalski offers rare insight into the humbling challenges of the service industry, where hourly workers scrape together rent money with thin margins for health or child care emergencies. Well-known in improv circles and for her turns on the TV series ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""Crashing,"" the comedian Lauren Lapkus hasn't gotten the breakout roles in film that she deserves, but her daffy performance in Robert Schwartzman's cringe comedy is evidence of her talent. Lapkus and Nick Rutherford star as a long-engaged couple who head to Palm Springs, Calif., for her parents' 25th wedding anniversary. In a bid to recharge their own flatlining relationship, the couple spends one spectacularly awkward evening in search of a threesome, but their crippling inhibitions make them a poor fit for swinger culture.",The streaming service has become a reliable destination for independent films.

Travel,36 Hours in Goa,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/travel/what-to-do-in-goa-india.html,"Think of it as India's happy place: The state of Goa, which occupies a sliver on the country's western coast, is where residents of Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore and other cities converge for long weekends and lazy holidays filled with sun, sand and revelry. These days, the beguiling beaches might look like they've been colonized by foreign hippies and rave-goers by the thousands, but the region's European connection dates back centuries. The Portuguese defeated the Adil Shahi dynasty of Bijapur in 1510, beginning a four-and-a-half-century reign -- Goa only became part of India in 1961, 14 years after the rest of the country won its independence from Britain. The result of this commingling of cultures is one of the most fascinating pockets of India, defined by a leisurely pace and laid-back attitude. Perhaps there's no better way to describe the vibe in Goa than ""susegaad,"" a Konkani term derived from Portuguese that alludes to a sybaritic, contented way of life -- or, as the travel show host and Goa resident Mayur Sharma told me, the feeling that you can ""sink into life here.""

Hire a car and driver and get your historical bearings in Goa Velha (Old Goa), the original walled Portuguese city once hailed as the Rome of the East. Goan Catholics make up about a third of the state's population today, and their influence is palpable in every corner. You can see where it all began in Old Goa, at places like the 17th-century Basilica of Bom Jesus; the Se Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic church built by the Portuguese in Asia, with its distinctive single belfry (the other one was struck down by lightning in 1776 and never rebuilt); and the Church of the Lady of the Mount, which has expansive views over the Mandovi River. When plague decimated Old Goa in the 19th century, the capital was moved a few miles west to Noa Goa, or New Goa, now known as Panaji or Panjim, the capital. There, you'll find the whitewashed Immaculate Conception Church, originally built in 1600, with zigzag steps modeled after Bom Jesus do Monte in Braga, Portugal. Stroll through Fontainhas, the colorful Latin Quarter, where you'll find old villas splashed in shades of marigold, turquoise and emerald, and fountains and handmade Portuguese tiles aplenty. Instagram was made for neighborhoods like this.

Sacha Mendes was a fashion editor at the Indian editions of Elle and GQ in Mumbai before she returned home to Goa, where she opened Sacha's Shop in Panaji. ""When you come from a place like Goa that's so pure, you wonder what's outside; then you go out and you feel nostalgic,"" she said of what inspired her homecoming. Now, in the elegant 1938 mansion in the heart of Panjim where she grew up -- the rooms were lovingly decorated by her grandfather with tiles and antiques imported from Macao and other Portuguese colonies -- she brings the ""outside"" to Goa. Browse resortwear from Indian labels like Savio Jon, Naushad Ali, and 11.11; mirror-work bags and accessories; and apricot kernel oils and scrubs from the skin care brand Pahadi Local. Kokni Kanteen might not look like much from the outside, but this restaurant, modeled after Portuguese-era khanavats, or taverns, is warm and inviting inside: Old photos, spice racks and clusters of chiles, garlic and onions are hung on the walls. Order the fish thali, a seemingly never-ending platter of seafood favorites like kingfish, mackerel curry, tisryo (clams), prawns and more -- if that's not enough, add a coriander-heavy chicken cafreal or mutton xacuti to the mix. Don't miss the cumin-dusted fries, either. Dinner for two is around 1,500 rupees or about $21.

Goa is incredibly spread out, so if you're short for time, you'll need to choose between spending your time in North or South Goa. Generally speaking, South Goa is more secluded, serene and not as developed, making it good for a relaxed long weekend. If you want a ""scene,"" with buzzing beaches, night life and restaurants aplenty, head north. Even here you'll find a variety of options: Arambol beach has a hippie vibe, complete with the occasional drum circle; Ashwem and Morjem are trendy; Vagator is known for its cliffs and rocky coves; and beautiful Mandrem is accessed by a rickety walkway over a creek. Spend your day beach-hopping through North Goa, or commit to one sandy stretch and settle in.

Bawmra Jap arrived in Goa about 15 years ago, and his modern Burmese restaurant, Bomra's, in Candolim has since become an institution -- you'll often come across its name on lists of India's top restaurants. Though it's set on a busy road, the airy patio decked with contemporary art is a calming oasis that shields you from the thrum. The food merits every accolade it's earned: The lah-pet toke (pickled tea leaf salad), raw beef salad with basil, mint and coriander, steamed chile crab, and lemongrass ginger creme brulee are outstanding. Expect to spend around 2,500 rupees for two; Bomra's is closed during the monsoon season (from May to September), so plan accordingly.

Set in a vivid blue, 130-year-old Portuguese manse in Panaji's hilly Altinho neighborhood, Sunaparanta Goa Centre for the Arts is a beguiling backdrop for an ever-changing roster of exhibitions -- you might stumble onto an art or photography show, a lecture or a music performance, some of which carry on into the evening in the villa's lovely garden. You can grab a coffee or a crepe at the sunlit courtyard cafe Bodega, but save room for a hearty dinner ahead. Not far from Miramar Beach, a popular hangout for local families who descend en masse to watch the sun set, the spotless Mum's Kitchen serves fiery Goan fare. For more than two decades, the owners have tapped into the recipes of Hindu and Catholic mothers of Goa to create an authentic menu of sungtachem peri-peri (prawns), pamplet recheiado (pomfret stuffed with red masala) and beef pepper garlic. Soothe the fire with an order of chourico pao, a local bread studded with sausage. Dinner for two is around 2,200 rupees.

The once-sleepy, suddenly trendy village of Assagao is home to the bistro Villa Blanche, which serves all-day breakfasts -- waffles, Greek scrambled eggs, scrambled tofu with sweet potato chips and chiles -- as well as German fare like imported Black Forest ham (a nod to the German owner), and lots of vegan and gluten-free options. But the main weekend draw is the decadent Sunday brunch buffet, with sausages, salads and so much more. Enjoy it in a cheery patio with tiled tables and mismatched throw pillows. Just up the road from Villa Blanche, in an easy-to-miss, painstakingly restored, 130-year-old Portuguese house, you'll find the Project Cafe. A satellite of a design initiative based in Ahmedabad, Gujarat, this multipurpose spread opened in late 2017 with an intimate guesthouse (each room was designed by a different Indian designer), gallery, cafe, events area and a concept shop featuring handmade cotton dresses from Khara Kapas, scents from Bombay Perfumery, books and more. Browse and enjoy the chic space, then grab a cocktail before you head out. Also in Assagao, Gunpowder is the restaurant credited with putting the quiet hamlet on the map. This perennially packed spot draws crowds to an outdoor dining platform draped in colorful, petal-like cloth panels for its South Indian fare -- you'll probably need to wait if you don't have a reservation, or if you're lucky, maybe another group will let you squeeze in for a communal meal. The Toddy Shop Meen Curry, a sour Kerala-style curry with coconut sauce (350 rupees) is the dish to get, but other contenders are the royyalu pulusu (Andhra style prawn curry, 450 rupees), mango-pineapple pachadi (fruits in a coconut-yogurt sauce, 250 rupees), and Kerala mutton curry (400 rupees). Right in the middle of Panjim's historic quarter, Mateus (432 Rua 31 de Janeiro, Fontainhas, Panaji; doubles from 3,000 rupees) is a nine-room boutique hotel set in a 140-year-old Portuguese home. The villa has lots of lovely, colorful touches -- from wrought-iron balconies to cane chairs to patterned Bharat Tiles to the cozy seating nooks with fuchsia and turquoise pillows -- and it's a great base for exploring Panjim's most important sites. If you want to stay closer to the beaches of the north, go to Casa Vagator (House No. 594/4, Ozran, Vagator, Bardez; doubles from 5,500 rupees). The 30 simple, but comfortable, rooms cascade down a cliffside toward Little Vagator Beach. Most rooms have terraces and outdoor seating areas, some overlooking one of the property's two pools.","Known for its gorgeous beaches and hippie vibe, this tiny state in western India also offers a fascinating blend of Indian and Portuguese influences that are reflected in its buildings, cuisine and art.",0c4b4ac8-0246-5e6e-9d9d-6b46e1b0b625,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/travel/24Hours-Goa2/24Hours-Goa2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=33e07274b6d1ca2edb08f26284f96acca9daea1c2b72a51d65ae93b3cc09e7b9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In Fontainhas, the colorful Latin Quarter, there are old villas splashed in shades of marigold, turquoise and emerald, and fountains and handmade Portuguese tiles aplenty.",0c4b4ac8-0246-5e6e-9d9d-6b46e1b0b625,N24News/imgs/0c4b4ac8-0246-5e6e-9d9d-6b46e1b0b625.jpg,4
Art & Design,"A Tangle of Relationships, and Art",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/arts/design/a-tangle-of-relationships-and-art.html,"A wall full of art can often map a complex network of relationships. It certainly does for Lisa Rosen, a conservator of paintings, and her husband, the painter Walter Robinson, a crucial figure among the image appropriators of the Pictures Generation.

The couple live on the fifth floor of an Upper East Side walk-up. Dozens of artworks fill their one-bedroom apartment, including ones by Richard Prince, Marilyn Minter and Tom Otterness. There's also a painting by Ms. Rosen's first husband, James Nares.

""Most of the collection is by friends and family,"" Mr. Robinson said. ""Everything here has a story.""

Certainly the couple has a meet-cute story. They first laid eyes on each other at the infamous Mudd Club in 1979, just before Ms. Rosen commenced a stint as a jet-setting runway model in Europe. After dating, they went their separate ways for about 20 years. ""Then I bumped into him in 2000 -- and I moved in, basically,"" Ms. Rosen, 56, recalled.

Theater,Casting Controversy Derailed a High School Play. Then Came the Threats.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/08/theater/hunchback-of-notre-dame-ithaca-high-school.html,"Ciara Renee as Esmeralda in a 2015 production of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.

It started as a local debate over a New York high school production of the musical ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame."" A white teenager was cast in the lead role of Esmeralda, a 15th-century Roma woman, spurring young student activists to object. Last month, after much discussion in the community, Ithaca High School pulled the show, aiming to replace it with something else. But the story doesn't end there. Those same students are now besieged by an online mob targeting them with threats and racial epithets after the incident was reported in right-wing publications like Breitbart News, then spread to the neo-Nazi site The Daily Stormer. Via Facebook, the students received pictures of themselves with swastikas plastered on their faces. One parent had what was thought to be her home address (it wasn't) posted online with a comment seeming to encourage harassment: ""Do your thing social media."" Another parent received a profane email, assailing her for embracing ""anti-white racism,"" adding: ""I feel sorry for your brainwashed child.""

Ithaca High School, in upstate New York, was to stage the musical, based on the 1831 novel by Victor Hugo and the 1996 Disney animated film, in mid-April. In Hugo's book, it is unclear whether both parents of Esmeralda are Roma. Also known as Gypsies, Roma are descendants of migrants who arrived in Europe from India more than a millennium ago. They have historically been disparaged across the continent, with many remaining impoverished to this day. And while two productions of the new musical -- its premiere at the La Jolla Playhouse in California in 2014 and one in 2015 at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey -- gave the part to a woman of color, Ciara Renee, the casting calls for those shows invited actresses of all ethnicities to audition for the role. Music Theatre International, the licensing company that holds the rights to ""Hunchback,"" says that Esmeralda is a female, aged between 20 and 30, and that she is a ""beautiful and free-spirited gypsy who possesses the strong sense of justice and morality."" But in the Disney film, Esmeralda has a dark complexion. And that is the version that Ithaca High School students grew up watching. That depiction, plus the precedent of Ms. Renee's casting, led some to believe the part would go to one of the high school's students of color, who make up 34 percent of the student body. Maddi Carroll, a 17-year-old African-American senior, said the high school's staging of ""Hunchback"" was initially exciting to her ""because we didn't feel like our high school usually put on productions with women of color in starring roles."" ""We were talking about us being younger and thinking about Disney princesses we had to look up to. For us, we really had Jasmine and Esmeralda,"" she added, referring also to the ""Aladdin"" character.

In January, Annabella Mead-VanCort, a senior who did not audition for the play, wrote a letter to Tompkins Weekly, a local publication, and had more than two dozen co-signers. It asserted that Esmeralda was accurately depicted in the Disney film and that the part was written for a young woman of color. ""Esmeralda is a Roma, part of an oppressed class of people,"" she wrote. ""It is her oppression, and that of her people, which allows her to better understand the perspective of the Hunchback and to ultimately advocate for him."" After the outcry, the school board held a community meeting on Jan. 23, when a number of students showed up wearing black in solidarity with the young activists, including Prachi Ruina, who had auditioned for the musical, and was cast in the ensemble. ""I call upon you to stop this musical now,"" she said to the board. ""You tear a community apart if you don't."" The next day, the school board announced that ""Hunchback"" would be pulled and a new production would be proposed. Mike Ellis, the father of the young actress who was originally cast as Esmeralda, said in an interview about the students' protest: ""Even though it involved a sacrifice on my daughter's part, I think the questions that they're asking are good, important questions that any school should want to ask itself.""

The events were reported on Jan. 29 in The Ithaca Journal. On Feb. 5, Breitbart picked up the news, writing that Esmeralda's race ""shouldn't matter."" The publication has covered Hollywood's recent casting controversies, including accusations of whitewashing when a white actor was cast in the film ""Hellboy"" to play a character portrayed as Asian in the original comic book. The Daily Stormer published a post about the high school's decision. Mainstream national outlets, including Fox News and The Washington Times, amplified the conversation. The comments online became ugly. On a 4chan, an anonymous message board, one post said that the students ""need to be 'dealt' with."" The Students United Ithaca Facebook page was particularly vitriolic, with some members receiving private messages saying, ""You are the real Nazis of this country,"" and ""You're a pathetic racist scum group."" Ms. Ruina was told to go back to India. On Facebook, one African-American student's personal page was tagged in a public comment that used a racial epithet, saying he ""is the reason we are looking for trees."" The student interpreted this as a threat of lynching. The Ithaca High School principal didn't respond to a request for comment, nor did the school district's superintendent. Dr. Sean Eversley Bradwell, vice president of the Ithaca Board of Education, wrote in an email that the board was ""very concerned about the level of vitriol directed at our students."" He also said the district had received more than 100 angry voice mail messages and 50 emails. The trolling has been taxing for the students. ""This is very, very surreal,"" Ms. Carroll said, adding, ""It's a lot to handle as a 17-year-old who is in high school right now, applying to college, trying to get ready for that stuff.""","After Ithaca High School canceled its production of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" because of students' pushback, an online mob targeted the town.",5e9cdcd4-69a6-5ae5-807d-67d52aedb164,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/09/arts/09hunchback-3/merlin_93374896_e7c2e8ea-6643-4e68-b21b-af3d7773f2f5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=adfc626e85af050a7f6a4fb603c8813e958fc5b941a0e8888b54615924302c7b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ciara Renée as Esmeralda in a 2015 production of ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey.",5e9cdcd4-69a6-5ae5-807d-67d52aedb164,N24News/imgs/5e9cdcd4-69a6-5ae5-807d-67d52aedb164.jpg,10
Movies,"After the Oscar Glare, These Filmmakers Went Their Own Way",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/movies/Benh-Zeitlin-Tom-McCarthy-sundance-film-festival.html,"PARK CITY, Utah -- When the writer-director Benh Zeitlin was unexpectedly thrust into the middle of the Oscar melee in 2012 with his debut feature, ""Beasts of the Southern Wild,"" it was a surreal, discomforting experience filled with stiff tuxedos and awkward small talk -- light years away from his ragtag existence in New Orleans, where he makes lyrical, atmospheric movies with his friends. Zeitlin was soothed somewhat by the people he met on the trail: a sit-down with Daniel Day-Lewis, a kind word from Sally Field, an interaction with Martin Scorsese, who was struggling at the time with his edit of ""Wolf of Wall Street."" ""It was cool to see someone that legendary be just as stressed as me when I was cutting 'Beasts,'"" said Zeitlin, a Hollywood outsider who before his Oscar run had only visited Los Angeles once in his life. Eight years later, this one-time Oscar wunderkind finally popped back up at this year's Sundance Film Festival with his sophomore effort, ""Wendy,"" a grass-roots ""Peter Pan"" seen through the eyes of a liberated, adventurous Wendy Darling. Where had he been?

The pressures of the Oscar spotlight can be enormous. As nominees this year have surely discovered, becoming part of the Hollywood ecosystem comes with its own set of challenges, ones that often require you to conform to specific expectations rather than to pursue your own creative endeavors. Zeitlin and another director who went through a similar experience, Tom McCarthy of ""Spotlight,"" resisted that pressure -- and at Sundance this month, the results of their decisions were on display. Zeitlin's time among the glitterati had crystallized what he wanted his future to look like, and it was nothing like theirs. As the recipient of two highly coveted nominations -- best director and best adapted screenplay (his film also drew a best picture nomination) -- Zeitlin had earned an invitation into the club. He could have easily parlayed his success into a hefty studio payday. Yet he chose a decidedly different route. He did hire an agent, temporarily, to fend off incoming offers, including the opportunity to work on a mega-budget ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie for Disney. ""He served as my bouncer,"" said Zeitlin, now 37, who instead took his newfound cachet and created his own pirate adventure.

""When it became clear that we were going to have this opportunity to make whatever we wanted, we were like, 'O.K., we got to make the craziest one now, because who knows if they'll ever let us back in,'"" he said. The Oscar visibility did buy him something: a bigger budget, a more ambitious palette and significant development money from his new studio partner, Fox Searchlight -- the company that secured a first-look deal with the auteur when it paid $2 million for U.S. rights to ""Beasts.""

He filmed on the islands of Montserrat and Antigua, Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and in Louisiana. Postproduction lasted close to two years. And the film was made using the same unconventional approach he employed for ""Beasts"": writing and rewriting all the way through production with his sister, Eliza Zeitlin, who also served as the production designer; casting nonactors to play the roles; preferring practical magic -- like using a thermite mixture to create underwater fire -- to computer graphics. Zeitlin debuted his film on Sunday to mixed reviews. The Playlist's Greg Ellwood said ""Zeitlin's talent to soar cinematically remains intact,"" while Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly wrote, ""By the ninth montage of cliffs and shore and joyful screaming down a hill, it all starts to feel a little like a film-school reel.""

Zeitlin's decision to spend so much time on his own arts-and-crafts project left many shaking their heads. They may be equally perplexed to see the writer-director Tom McCarthy, who took on the Catholic Church in the best-picture winner ""Spotlight"" (2015), return to Sundance with ""Timmy Failure: Mistakes Were Made,"" a kids' movie co-starring a computer-graphic polar bear that will debut on Disney Plus next week. ""I've seen a lot of people win Oscars, win best pictures, do that thing, and then it's like they're almost trying too hard to go back to the well,"" McCarthy said. ""I didn't want to do that."" The awards race marathon -- which this year concludes on Feb. 9 -- is a boon for the industry: Studios spend gobs to promote their best films, and the Hollywood ecosystem froths from the trickle-down economics. Everybody from trade publications to florists to limo drivers benefits from the awards industrial complex -- everyone, except maybe the talent. Yes, their star power rises in both ephemeral and concrete ways, but for those hellbent on creating their own destiny, the months away from their work can be dispiriting.

McCarthy too had moved his family temporarily to Los Angeles for his awards-campaign obligations. It was a ""wholly uncreative"" time, he said. The 53-year old director, who began his career as a character actor, had been warned years earlier that this would happen. Back in 2004, he had a toe-dip experience with the awards race when his directorial debut, ""Station Agent,"" vied briefly for accolades against Peter Jackson's final ""Lord of the Rings"" installment. McCarthy kept running into the New Zealander on the campaign trail, and Jackson's frenetic pace didn't align with the rest of the nominees' behavior. His secret: In between all the glad-handing he would hole up at a hotel in Los Angeles writing ""King Kong"" with Fran Walsh and Philippa Boyens. ""He said to me, 'If you can, cling to the work,'"" McCarthy recalled. Cut to 2016, and McCarthy found his creative reprieve two weeks before the Oscars, when his New York theater friend Brian Yorkey asked him to help out on a new Netflix series ""13 Reasons Why."" A surprising follow-up to ""Spotlight""? Maybe. But the project was set to start shooting soon, and McCarthy could dive in, writing and directing on what would become one of the streaming giant's most popular series. ""I really just wanted to work,"" McCarthy said. ""I didn't have another movie ready, and I didn't want to just jump into another movie.""

That same ethos has now returned McCarthy to Sundance, 17 years after the festival launched his directing career. His friends have given him grief for giving up his indie cred; one text message read, ""See you're keeping it real at Sundance with your Disney movie."" He, too, is aware of the irony. For ""Station Agent,"" his producers gave out beef jerky as the film's party favor. For the ""Timmy"" premiere, Disney created an ice sculpture of a polar bear. Still, McCarthy finds no shame in making a kids' movie. To him, chronicling the adventures of a quirky, complicated kid detective was just as invigorating as depicting the Boston Globe newsroom in ""Spotlight."" ""This film was still a tremendous challenge, dealing with what does it mean to make a movie for 10-year-olds, and what does it mean to have a polar bear in the movie? Whenever I'm engaged like that, I'm happy,"" he said. Zeitlin's grand experiment of keeping Hollywood at arm's length has also meant he could maintain his single-minded approach to making movies. It helps that he's changed very little in his life since ""Beasts."" He moved into a different rented house, though not a nicer one. He's single. He doesn't own a car, or even a pet. ""My biggest fear is not being able to make my art,"" he said. ""If people don't like my movie or whatever, knowing that I can always go home and live, and make things that I want to make has always been really important to me. So, I've never taken on anything that would be a real problem if I lost it.""","Benh Zeitlin (""Beasts of the Southern Wild"") and Tom McCarthy (""Spotlight"") each found that the awards machine distracted from the real work.",e4791519-6e28-5f76-974c-09f7f8c0f635,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/31/arts/30oscar-hunt1/30oscar-hunt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=85039bd5519341fe1ecd6d11a38bc5cd82e3c1a9c28127587f8ba9cd24b14626&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Zeitlin, left, and McCarthy are each at Sundance with follow-ups to their Oscar-nominated films.",e4791519-6e28-5f76-974c-09f7f8c0f635,N24News/imgs/e4791519-6e28-5f76-974c-09f7f8c0f635.jpg,5
Media,ESPN Pulls Announcer Robert Lee From Virginia Game Because of His Name,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/23/business/media/robert-lee-university-virginia-charlottesville.html,"After the violence in Charlottesville, which left one person dead, ESPN executives and Mr. Lee decided that for his safety it would be best to have him to work on a different game that Saturday, a network spokesman said.

""We collectively made the decision with Robert to switch games as the tragic events in Charlottesville were unfolding, simply because of the coincidence of his name,"" ESPN said in a statement. ""In that moment it felt right to all parties. It's a shame that this is even a topic of conversation and we regret that who calls play-by-play for a football game has become an issue.""

Mr. Lee did not return a call seeking comment. The website Outkick the Coverage reported on Mr. Lee's removal on Tuesday afternoon.

Before the demonstrations in Charlottesville, ESPN had planned for Mr. Lee to be in the announcer's booth for the Virginia Cavaliers' first game of the season, against the College of William and Mary, which will be broadcast on the ACC Network. Mr. Lee will instead announce Youngstown State's game against the University of Pittsburgh, which will appear on the same network.

Mr. Lee, whose full-time job is at a payroll services company in Albany, started announcing games for ESPN and its other networks last fall, according to his LinkedIn page. For the past 17 years, he has also announced men's basketball games for Siena College in Albany. He graduated from Syracuse University in 1999 with a degree in broadcast journalism.","The network said Mr. Lee, who shares a name with a Confederate general, would cover another football game on Sept. 2 instead of the University of Virginia game.",92f032d4-a675-5936-9247-f9e7cfd37a00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/23/us/23xp-espen1/23xp-espen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=341&w=652&s=fd25c60cd9db591d6fce249bcb0e819c916942688c671b317c47ce408b33b99d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The network said that for safety reasons, Lee, right, would not be in the broadcast booth as planned for the University of Virginia's Sept. 2 game at Charlottesville.",92f032d4-a675-5936-9247-f9e7cfd37a00,N24News/imgs/92f032d4-a675-5936-9247-f9e7cfd37a00.jpg,16
Sports,"N.B.A. Fines Anthony Davis $50,000 After Agent's Request for a Trade",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/29/sports/anthony-davis-fine-trade.html,"Paul declined to comment on Tuesday. Davis refused to speak to reporters before New Orleans's game on Tuesday night against the Houston Rockets.

In another high-profile case of a player's trade request this season, Jimmy Butler was not fined after pressing to be dealt from the Minnesota Timberwolves in September, because neither Butler nor his agent, Bernie Lee, openly discussed Butler's wishes with the news media. The Timberwolves ultimately traded Butler to the Philadelphia 76ers on Nov. 10.

But in a subsequent example, Cleveland's J. R. Smith -- who is also represented by Paul -- dodged a fine after he publicly requested a trade in November. Smith was sent away from the Cavaliers in a mutual decision between the team and Paul to allow Cleveland to try to find a new home for Smith.

The Los Angeles Lakers are at the forefront of teams trying to persuade the Pelicans to surrender Davis before the Feb. 7 trade deadline.

The Knicks are also determined to establish themselves as a factor in the bidding for Davis, according to a person with knowledge of the team's plans. The Knicks, though, realize that they might not be able to make their bid for Davis until May, when the order for the top of the June draft is set, according to the person, who was not authorized to discuss the situation publicly.","The league called the agent's public request for New Orleans to trade his client an ""intentional effort to undermine the contractual relationship between Davis and the Pelicans.""",f94da6d2-f621-5a2b-894d-5f64b78010cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/30/sports/30davis1/merlin_149668284_a400302d-8b44-4b7c-b5d2-8cde1a185b28-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=491a8558bdbb50c6cb9008b21d1645f2549f930ff43d14b04312a711d767918f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Anthony Davis was fined for his agent's comments, which an N.B.A. statement said had violated ""a collectively bargained rule prohibiting players or their representatives from making public trade demands.""",f94da6d2-f621-5a2b-894d-5f64b78010cc,N24News/imgs/f94da6d2-f621-5a2b-894d-5f64b78010cc.jpg,9
Media,"After Fetching a High Price, Time Magazine Moves Into a New Era",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/17/business/media/time-sale-fortune-sports-illustrated.html,"When Time magazine started in 1923, it hit upon a popular formula: short, punchy items that aggregated the week's events and came in an entertaining package. But the newsweekly could never compete with the digital version of its own blueprint: the internet's bloggers, explainers, listicles and 30-second videos.  In March, Meredith, which agreed to buy Time Inc. in November, announced that it would put Time magazine up for sale, along with Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money. After nearly six months, Time found its new owners when the software titan Marc Benioff and his wife, Lynne, agreed to pay $190 million in cash for the magazine. Mr. Benioff said he had ""always loved it"" in a text message interview with The New York Times.

Alan Murray, the chief content officer of the former Time Inc. brands, who helped lead the process, and Meredith's banking adviser, Citigroup, placed potential bidders into tiered groups. The groups were based on several factors, including the ability to pay and the level of seriousness. Meredith considered selling all the titles together but soon settled on individual transactions. Money will most likely be bundled with Fortune when it is sold. ""It was a learning process for me, and these things just take a lot longer than you think they would,"" Mr. Murray said. Marc Benioff does things his own way: ""I didn't realize two weeks ago I was going to buy Time."" Sports Illustrated, Fortune and Money should be sold by the end of the year, he said. ""There are very healthy, advanced conversations going on,"" he added, though he declined to comment on specific suitors. ""I'm optimistic.""

Meredith fended off a $325 million offer for Time from David J. Pecker, the media executive who has become a key witness in a federal investigation into President Trump. During the presidential campaign, Mr. Pecker, who publishes The National Enquirer, suppressed the story of a former Playboy model who claimed to have had an affair with Mr. Trump, according to federal prosecutors. Until a few weeks ago, Mr. Benioff was nearing an agreement to acquire Fortune and Money, according to four people familiar with the sales process who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss private talks. He switched his preference to Time when he decided its business was stronger, one of the people said.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Reed Phillips, a longtime investment banker specializing in media transactions, said the purchase price was surprisingly high. ""For a business in decline, that's a big number,"" he said. ""It seems that when billionaires buy media assets, it's almost like they're making a nonprofit donation. They're not doing this as a moneymaker. This is more of a cause."" Meredith had been asking as much as $200 million for Fortune as recently as May, two of the people said. Fortune benefits from a lucrative conference business, but a big share of those profits comes from an event it produces in China for which a municipality pays most of the cost, the people said.

Mr. Benioff is the latest tech billionaire to take the reins of a historic news brand. Jeff Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, bought The Washington Post in 2013, and last year, Laurene Powell Jobs, who heads the Emerson Collective and is the widow of the Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, bought a majority stake of The Atlantic magazine. Media outlets have also become attractive to billionaires focused on philanthropic endeavors. Mr. Benioff has spoken out on the gender pay gap and protested an Indiana law that critics said discriminated against people who are gay or transgender. He said he would stay away from Time's editorial decisions. But the re-emergence of billionaire media proprietors isn't a sign the news profession is bouncing back, said Kyle Pope, the editor in chief of the Columbia Journalism Review. ""Let's not read anything more into this about the health of newsmagazines,"" he said. ""Most papers and magazines across the country are still desperate."" He added: ""Iconic magazines like Time will always have a suitor because people like Benioff will always want to own these things. It's a good way to keep these titles going, but it doesn't seem like it's good for journalism writ large."" With Time, Mr. Benioff and his wife will face challenges. The magazine's revenue inched past $170 million last year with profits around $25 million, according to two of the people familiar with its finances. Expenses at Meredith's magazine division grew by more than $566 million with the addition of Time Inc., while profits shrank by more than a third to $98 million in the 12 months ending in June, when the company reports its fiscal year.

As part of the Time deal, Meredith will continue to provide shared services for the magazine, helping Mr. Benioff save on print and ink costs. Marketing and subscription fulfillment will also be included in that agreement. Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice who spent over 10 years at Time during the 1980s and '90s, said he had stopped reading the magazine after Meredith acquired it but was considering renewing his subscription after the sale. ""They need to go back to a much more traditional word-filled product,"" he said, comparing Time with The Economist, a text-heavy magazine that has fared well. ""They need to take a deeper look and not just with investigative reporting. That's how they'll differentiate themselves now.""","""These things just take a lot longer than you think they would,"" one executive said of the sale of Time magazine. Now Meredith must turn to the sales of Fortune and Sports Illustrated.",162d099c-3590-5105-a244-7c67eb6200a7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/business/18TIMEINC-top/18TIMEINC-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cde5752ce0dc2a4ce2e91e721c79015a1d56d1bcb8734a6c1ced3de79d61ffac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Time's sales and profits, like those of most print publications, have been shrinking every year, a situation that made it difficult to sell the magazine, even with its storied past.",162d099c-3590-5105-a244-7c67eb6200a7,N24News/imgs/162d099c-3590-5105-a244-7c67eb6200a7.jpg,16

He was 71.

His daughter, Kahlillah Dotson Mosley, said the cause was liver failure.

Dotson was a hard-nosed, 6-foot-4 point guard on a disciplined team, coached by Jack Rohan, that was known for its full-court pressing defense. On the 1967-68 team, Dotson averaged 13.7 points a game, third to Jim McMillian, and led the Lions in assists.

""When we went into big games, teams were not ready for how hard we played,"" Dotson said in a 2018 interview posted on the Lions' Twitter account. He added, ""They called us the little Knickerbockers.""

After starting the season with 4-3 record, the Lions won 16 in a row; after losing their final regular season game to Princeton, they routed Princeton three days later, 92-74, to win the Ivy League championship. Dotson scored 19 while McMillian poured in 37.

Science,"China's Ban on Wildlife Trade a Big Step, but Has Loopholes, Conservationists Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/science/coronavirus-pangolin-wildlife-ban-china.html,"China this week announced a permanent ban on wildlife trade and consumption that international conservationists greeted as a major step, but one with troublesome loopholes for trade in wild animals for medicinal uses.

A wild animal market in Wuhan may have been where the outbreak of Covid-19 began, and pangolins, in particular, have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.

China had already banned the wildlife markets. The action on Monday by a standing committee of the 13th National People's Congress went further. The decision on ""Comprehensively Prohibiting the Illegal Trade of Wild Animals, Eliminating the Bad Habits of Wild Animal Consumption, and Protecting the Health and Safety of the People,"" bans all trade and eating of non-aquatic wild animals.

But, according to an analysis by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the decision does not ban trade for fur, medicine or research. ""This creates a potential loophole for traffickers who may exploit the nonfood exemptions to sell or trade live wildlife,"" the group said in a statement.","The coronavirus epidemic prompted China to permanently ban trade of wild animals as food, but not for medicinal use.",db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/science/27VIRUS-WILDLIFE/27VIRUS-WILDLIFE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8bf0c6a8165e1dbb055d688530ff7d4f773699f6048da7e45f591a7610c17989&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Pangolins in particular have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.,db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b,N24News/imgs/db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b.jpg,2
Technology,Big Tech Zeros In on the Virus-Testing Market,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/technology/big-tech-google-verily-virus-testing.html,"Verily Life Sciences, a sister company of Google, scrambled to introduce a free coronavirus-screening site for the public and set up testing locations in March after President Trump made an off-the-cuff announcement about the program. It had a rocky start, but has since helped more than 220,000 people get tested in 13 states. Now, the company has its sights set on employers. It is introducing a health screening and analytics service for businesses trying to safely reopen during the pandemic. The service, announced on Thursday, will offer Covid-19 diagnostic testing for employees and clear them to return to the workplace based on their test results and other health data. It will also make recommendations to employers on how often workers should be retested, based on the prevalence of the virus in their work force and the local community.

""Employers are really focusing on how to ensure that they are not the source of another outbreak,"" said Dr. Vivian Lee, the president of health platforms at Verily, a unit of Google's parent company, Alphabet. ""And that they do not wind up in a situation where they're putting the safety of their employees at risk when they need to be back in an office or a workplace setting.""

With its new service, Verily is joining numerous tech giants and start-ups rushing to help business across the United States as they grapple with how to safely reopen the workplace. Microsoft and the large insurer UnitedHealth Group, for instance, recently collaborated on a free symptom-checking app that helps pinpoint workers at obvious risk for the virus and direct them to testing resources. On Tuesday, Fitbit introduced a program that includes a daily symptom-checking app for employees and a work force health-monitoring dashboard for employers. Kogniz, an artificial intelligence start-up, is marketing thermal camera systems as coronavirus fever-screening and ""social-distancing enforcement"" tools for the workplace. And Jvion, another A.I. start-up, is marketing an ""employer recovery package"" to predict the risk of employee exposure to the virus and likelihood of developing it. There is such a glut of new coronavirus risk-reduction products that it's a challenge for many employers to assess them all. ""A big market rose up overnight,"" said Jeff Becker, a senior analyst for digital business strategy at Forrester, a market research firm, who recently surveyed two dozen vendors offering coronavirus solutions for employers. ""But it's a fractured ecosystem, much like traditional health care.""

To address the fragmented market, Verily and other health companies are introducing more comprehensive health-screening programs for employers, complete with Covid-19 lab tests and health counseling for employees who test positive. The new services are also trying to mitigate a pressing problem for employers: Perhaps one quarter or more of people who have the virus do not experience symptoms like fevers and coughs. That means symptom-checking apps and fever-scanning cameras could clear employees who have the virus to return to the workplace, where they might inadvertently infect their colleagues. Color, a Bay Area health technology company whose labs are processing Covid-19 tests for the City of San Francisco, reported on Monday that, among a group of 30,000 people it tested for the virus, the majority of those who tested positive had mild or no symptoms. ""Things like fever checks, fever screening -- those things are actually not going to prevent transmission in a workplace setting,"" said Caroline Savello, the chief commercial officer at Color, which recently introduced a testing program for employers. Many medical centers, nursing homes and other high-risk facilities for essential workers have already adopted such employee-testing programs. Color's program for businesses that are reopening involves testing employees for the virus at least once before they return to the workplace, and then testing asymptomatic employees again at regular intervals.

""This gives our companies, our employees great peace of mind because they know that everybody that's coming into the laboratory to do the research is negative,"" Dr. Kathiresan said. ""So it's an expense that is well worth it."" The Landscape of the Post-Pandemic Return to Office
* None
* Delta-variant delays. A wave of the contagious Delta variant is causing companies to reconsider when they will require employees to return, and what health requirements should be in place when they do.
* A generation gap. While workers of all ages have become accustomed to dialing in and skipping the wearying commute, younger ones have grown especially attached to the new way of doing business. This is causing some difficult conversations between managers and newer hires.
* How to keep offices safe. Handwashing is a simple way to reduce the spread of disease, but employers should be thinking about improved ventilation systems, creative scheduling and making sure their building is ready after months of low use.
* Return-to-work anxiety. Remote work brought many challenges, particularly for women of color. But going back will also mean a return to microaggressions, pressure to conform to white standards of professionalism, and high rates of stress and burnout. He said he expected employee-testing costs to decrease significantly over time as home self-collection kits, which allow people to swab their own noses or collect saliva samples and then send them to labs, became more available. Federal health authorities, however, have so far provided little guidance for businesses on testing employees for coronavirus. In late May, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published guidelines on ""Resuming Business,"" which recommended that employers prepare a ""plan for conducting daily in-person or virtual health checks (e.g., symptom and/or temperature screening) before employees enter the facility."" But the guidelines mentioned employee testing for the virus only in passing. One concern is that the diagnostic tests could give employees a false sense of security, public health experts said. Because the virus can take several days to develop, they said, the time between taking a test and getting the lab results back could cause some employees who have the virus to receive false negative test results. Despite comprehensive testing, for instance, a group of Army recruits and instructors at Fort Benning, Ga., recently suffered a major outbreak of the virus. Another concern is that scaling employee-testing programs nationwide could lead to unnecessary medical screening -- particularly for workplaces where employees, wearing masks, can be spaced far enough apart to adhere to social-distancing guidelines -- and might overwhelm labs that are running more urgent coronavirus tests for patients with serious symptoms. And some employees may object to being required to take medical tests and have the results automatically sent to their employers. Dr. Lee, the Verily executive, said the company would consult with employers to tailor virus testing and workplace safety protocols to the number of their employees, workplace locations, the prevalence of coronavirus in the local community and the type of work employees performed.","As businesses grapple with how to safely reopen the workplace, companies like Fitbit and Verily, Google's sister company, are rushing out new work force health-vetting and tracking tools.",61587f48-0da3-5ef7-8e21-a8df02f4cc43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/18/business/18virus-techscreening1/18virus-techscreening1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9489ecdea6a107cfc04719ffb1819d5a66e05db0aa2c209c77c670cc1636a1a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"After setting up sites like this coronavirus drive-through test clinic in San Mateo, Calif., Verily is introducing a virus screening and health analytics service for employers.",61587f48-0da3-5ef7-8e21-a8df02f4cc43,N24News/imgs/61587f48-0da3-5ef7-8e21-a8df02f4cc43.jpg,20
Health,Reuniting and Detaining Migrant Families Pose New Mental Health Risks,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/22/health/migrant-families-immigration-detention.html,"The chaotic process of reuniting thousands of migrant children and parents separated by the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy poses great psychological risks, both short- and long-term, mental health experts said on Friday. So does holding those families indefinitely while they await legal proceedings, which could happen under the president's new executive order. The administration has no clear plan to reunite migrant families, which is sure to carry a psychological price for migrant parents and more than 2,300 children separated from them at the border in recent months. More than 400 are under age 12, and many are toddlers. But the alternative of keeping those families in camps, on military bases and in other facilities for long periods of time while they work their way through the legal and asylum systems will quite likely impose its own trauma, as it did for families of Japanese descent held by the United States in internment camps during World War II. ""People have been very focused on technical pieces of this process, and the egregiousness of children in cages,"" said Jennifer Rodriguez, executive director of the Youth Law Center, an advocacy group based in San Francisco and focused on protecting the rights of children. ""But they're not thinking about most basic fundamental trauma we're inflicting on people.""

On Friday in The New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. Fiona Danaher, a pediatrician at MassGeneral Hospital for Children in Boston, warned that traumatic experiences like those experienced by migrants could lead to ""changes in physiology that promote physical and mental illness throughout the life course."" The effects can be felt for generations, she noted. Already, mental health experts said in interviews, two psychological undercurrents are in motion among the separated migrant families: one individual, the other collective. At the individual level, many of the parents torn from their children will not have easy reunions, experts said. ""I would want to make sure -- before any reunion -- that the children know that their parents did not want this to happen, and that it was not their own fault, either,"" said Brenda Jones Harden, a professor of human development at the University of Maryland.

In a series of studies, social scientists at the University of Delaware and elsewhere have carefully tracked the experience of young children entering foster families by having new parents keep detailed diaries and closely monitor parent-child interaction using standardized checklists. Young children often avoid engaging a new caregiver -- behavior that can in turn put off a new mother or father, creating more distance and doubt in the relationship. A similar dynamic can occur when parents are taken away and then suddenly reappear. ""Children often adapt to separations by looking as if they don't need their parents upon reuniting,"" said Mary Dozier, a professor of psychological and brain sciences at the University of Delaware, who led some of the separation studies. Parents may feel rejected and react in kind, by acting as if their children don't need them, Dr. Dozier said. ""A self-perpetuating cycle can begin. It's usually resolved over time, but it's helpful if parents can anticipate that their children may not run into their arms and be soothed readily."" Children reunited with their parents may also turn away or be difficult to soothe, said Kristin Bernard, a psychologist at Stony Brook University who works with foster children. Those reactions, combined with the desperation washing through their parents, ""may get in the way of parents providing the nurturing and responsive care that children need at this critical time,"" she said.

For the youngest children especially, a week or two away is a very long time, a period of deepening uncertainty. The visceral memory of a parent can fade quickly in the mind of toddler, compared to more mature youngsters. By age 9, Jordan Sosa, now 23, had seen both of his parents deported to Mexico on drug-use charges. ""I saw my dad being dragged off, and I'm the oldest. My brothers and sisters kept asking, 'What happened to Dad? What happened to Mom?'"" said Mr. Sosa, who is now a congressional intern. ""I remember I'd wait until they went to bed and then just cry."" He and his siblings entered foster care in Southern California, reuniting with their parents more than a year later. ""For me, with my mom, it was like she was dead and suddenly came back alive. I had had a relationship with her,"" Mr. Sosa said. ""But for my younger sisters it was like, 'No, I have a new family now.'""

Following the president's executive order earlier this week, the Trump administration has asked a Federal District Court in Los Angeles to alter a consent decree that effectively limits the detention of migrant families to no more than 20 days. The Pentagon has been asked to make room for as many as 20,000 migrants. The collective mental impact of holding hundreds of families in camps or institutions, for months or years, is hard to measure. Writing in The Washington Post, the former first lady Laura Bush, among others, was quick to note that the proposed camps for migrant families are ""eerily reminiscent of the Japanese-American internment camps of World War II.""

After the Pearl Harbor attack in 1941, the federal government interned 120,000 Japanese-Americans in about a dozen camps, typically in barracks, one family to a room, and cut off from the outside world by barbed wire. The incarceration lasted up to four years, and most families remained together. This mass internment is distinct from the current proposal in important ways: The inmates were predominantly United States citizens, and they had committed no crime. Yet many researchers believe the trauma to migrant families could be similar, in terms of rates of depression and post-traumatic stress. ""There are certainly parallels,"" said Donna Nagata, a professor of psychology at the University of Michigan whose parents met in a Utah internment camp and who has followed a large group of people who spent time in the camps. In one study, she had 520 of them fill out extensive questionnaires, detailing aspects of their individual personalities and how they coped with the experience of mass incarceration over time. While their experiences varied, negative effects of the camps remained. ""The sansei -- the adolescent and children offspring, born in the United States after the war -- lived with this sense of sadness and anger over what happened to their parents, and with the realization that a portion of their lives had been taken away,"" Dr. Nagata said. That is, if they comprehended their parents' trauma at all. ""There was a silence about it, down through the generations, a silence on the part of the parents that only piqued their interest and made them aware that there was a really important gap in their history that they longed to know,"" said Dr. Nagata, author of the book ""Legacy of Injustice: Exploring the Cross-Generational Impact of the Japanese American Internment.""

A woman named Carola, who lives in Western Canada and asked that her last name be omitted because both of her parents are still alive, said her mother spent four years in an internment camp as a child, ""leaving her psychologically scarred for life."" ""She was consumed with rage, suffered flashbacks, depression and paranoia,"" Carola said. ""The experience left her with no possibility for a 'normal' happy life. Obviously, my siblings and I also suffered.""",Experts say the parents and children split apart at the border could face difficult reunions. Holding them indefinitely could be even worse.,3924f4a5-9235-5115-a303-b94ed5d0dd10,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/23/science/23DETENTION1/23DETENTION1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c7877b9aa11dabb79c7e2b12e71c5b5875f9b50159ba4c5032f52890b8199aff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Migrants waiting for asylum hearings outside the port of entry on the American border in Tijuana, Mexico.

Theater,"For the 'Soldier's Play' Star Blair Underwood, the Uniform Fits",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/theater/blair-underwood-father.html,"It was the salute delivered by his son onstage that stood out most to Frank Underwood Sr. when he attended ""A Soldier's Play"" on Broadway on Jan. 21. Underwood Sr., a retired Army colonel who served for almost three decades, was there on opening night watching the Golden Globe-nominated actor Blair Underwood deliver a spirited performance as the dogged Capt. Richard Davenport, who investigates the murder of a black sergeant near an Army base in Louisiana in 1944. The play, written by Charles Fuller and first produced by the Negro Ensemble Company, is a nuanced exploration of segregation, race relations and colorism that won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981. Underwood Sr., now 87, grew up on a farm in Wintersville, Ohio (""Our existence was trees and dirt""), and had never seen the play, nor the 1984 film adaptation. Yet though he began serving in the military after it had been integrated by President Harry S. Truman in 1948, the issues raised in the drama were instantly recognizable.

When Kenny Leon, the director of the Roundabout Theater Company revival, asked Underwood whether he'd want to take the lead role, the answer was a quick yes. ""I always joked with my dad that I may not join the Army but I'll be in the military in a movie or on a stage somewhere,"" Underwood, 55, said Wednesday, sitting next to his father, who wore a black leather jacket with ""A Soldier's Play"" emblazoned on it. In a joint interview, the Underwoods discussed Army base life, what makes a good salute, and that moment in the second act. The conversation has been edited.

What was running through your mind as you watched the play? Frank Underwood Sr. What it does, for the public, is unveil what society was like in that time, the lack of receptiveness to African-Americans. The system allowed that. Did you talk to your father in preparing for this role? Blair Underwood Not too much. My preparation was my lifetime growing up in a military family. I didn't have to ask a lot of questions. It was very natural. Do you have a particularly vivid memory of growing up on Army bases? Underwood We would be outside playing flag football, hide and seek, tag, whatever it may be. At 5 o'clock, every day, they would play either ""Reveille"" or the national anthem, and whatever you were doing, you would stop and stand at attention and face the flag. You could be on the football field or in the woods. You could hear it all across the base. Do you see your father in the characters onstage with you? Underwood Absolutely. I see him in my character. He's an officer among enlisted men. This man, Captain Davenport, like my father, as an African-American man, you have to make your presence felt and understood and you have to find a way for people to respect you beyond the rank. My dad's battalion used to call him ""The Man of Steel and Velvet"" because he ruled with a discipline but he had an empathetic quality to him. That's what I tried to infuse in Davenport. What parts of yourself did you see in the play? Underwood Sr. I certainly saw it in the role Blair had to play. I felt, ""O.K., yeah, that's what I would do."" I liked his salute. He had a very good salute. It's authoritative.

Did you teach him how to salute correctly as a child? Underwood Sr. He saw it enough. Underwood One thing I did ask my dad over Christmas: I didn't understand if you could actually sit down and salute. We stand up mostly in the play, but you don't have to. The beauty in the saluting is that it's really layered, and infused with the relationship of the person you're saluting. The salute itself is a language unto itself.

Underwood Sr. That's the key thing to understand. Why do we salute? Respect. When you don't salute, there's a message there. Your father just said that he saw your performance and said, ""That's what I would do."" That must be source of immense pride. Underwood He's seen me play so many characters in 35 years, some very bad. It's nice when you can play a character aligned with his values, because I respect those values. Growing up, what kind of conversations did the two of you have about racism? Underwood I have to tell you, we didn't talk about it a lot. We talked about it in terms of, ""You are an African-American. You are a black man."" My dad taught me when I was 10 years old: ""Everything you do as a black man in this country is a political statement. Everything you do. Not what you say."" The way I've built my life and my career, I don't need to talk a lot. It's what you do. I've always known and understood that excellence is the best deterrent to racism, period. That's how we were raised. Underwood Sr. There's an old saying in the military: ""You lead by example."" That's what I always tried to do with my men in the military. I'm sorry, I have to ask this in good conscience, Blair, otherwise my fiancee might pre-divorce me. During the second act, there is a moment during a monologue when you're getting dressed and the crowd goes wild. Was this moment planned? Underwood What's planned is that the script says the character is getting dressed. You can never plan the reaction. Were you surprised by it? Underwood I was the first time. Maybe the director knew something I didn't know. During rehearsals, I just have two buttons unbuttoned; I'm thinking about my lines. When we moved from the rehearsal hall to the stage, the director, Kenny Leon, said, ""Blair, this is a real note, don't laugh. I think you should just unbutton a couple of more buttons, because I think some people in the audience might appreciate it.""",His father served for three decades but had never seen the military drama. So they had a lot to talk about after its opening night on Broadway.,bee1fef4-33d5-50fb-8bc6-62e5fb09dfda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/02/arts/02underwoods/02underwoods-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b0c5c6fbd1632c5eab360462a31505946e70410369022278f84de3212b72f692&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Blair Underwood, who plays an Army captain in ""A Soldier's Play,"" with his father, Frank Underwood, a retired colonel.",bee1fef4-33d5-50fb-8bc6-62e5fb09dfda,N24News/imgs/bee1fef4-33d5-50fb-8bc6-62e5fb09dfda.jpg,10
Style,Stockard Channing and Friends Usher in a New Chelsea Bar,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/15/style/stockard-channing-and-friends-usher-in-a-new-chelsea-bar.html,"Shopworn volumes lined the room, lanterns shed an amber light, and a pair of ancient bed irons weighed down the tartan tossed across the bed. Those cozy atmospherics didn't escape Stockard Channing, who had gusted into the Lodge at Gallow Green, a new rooftop bar in Chelsea, on a blast of sleety air the other night.

""I feel like I'm in some rustic summer camp -- with alcohol,"" she said huskily, her voice warmed by the vodka martini she sipped as she surveyed the 10-by-10-foot space at the rear of the rustically kitted-out restaurant.

Moments earlier, Ms. Channing, the evening's honoree, had made her entrance at the bar, built above the McKittrick Hotel. She was still flushed from her performance as a star on the skids in Terrence McNally's name-dropping satire, ""It's Only a Play."" She was swaddled against the elements, and as if for a night on the heath, in a cashmere sweater, racy leather trousers and a battered fedora.

""The hat is to cover my wig hair,"" she murmured as she snaked past friends and colleagues, among them F. Murray Abraham, Matthew Broderick and Mr. McNally himself, each hoisting a placard announcing no more than six degrees of separation from the star, each sign a winking reference to the memorable film role that had helped to cement Ms. Channing's decades-long career.","A night out with Ms. Channing, who currently stars in Terrence McNally's name-dropping satire, ""It's Only a Play.""",632df1ff-62b8-5c77-b3e1-c5b3fe34759a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/15/fashion/15NIGHTOUT/15NIGHTOUT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=3c106b9b05251138444cbea1db5c9374e095fce69aaea2960aaa26b2bdd8da14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A night out with Ms. Channing, who currently stars in Terrence McNally's name-dropping satire, ""It's Only a Play.""",632df1ff-62b8-5c77-b3e1-c5b3fe34759a,N24News/imgs/632df1ff-62b8-5c77-b3e1-c5b3fe34759a.jpg,15
Books,The Life-or-Death Struggle of Refugees Braving the Mediterranean Crossing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/books/review/davide-enia-notes-on-shipwreck.html,"NOTES ON A SHIPWRECK 

By Davide Enia 

Translated by Antony Shugaar

249 pp. Other Press. Paper, $16.99.

The island of Lampedusa, as the Italian playwright and journalist Davide Enia explains in this quiet yet urgent memoir, is territorially European but belongs tectonically to nearby Africa. For some 20 years, migrants and refugees launching from Africa have been arriving on this remote, treeless outpost, hoping to travel on to the European mainland. Over 400,000 people have now reached Europe via Lampedusa and at least 15,000 have died trying.

Having volunteered on Lesvos -- the Lampedusa of the Aegean -- in 2015, when half a million Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan refugees arrived via Turkey, I can confirm that ""Notes on a Shipwreck"" rings graphically true: the sodden families huddled on piers and beaches, the chain-smoking paramedics, divers, fishermen and other volunteers reluctantly compelled, like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, to report their stories.

Enia quotes such witnesses in generous detail. ""Human beings who carry an entire graveyard inside them,"" they include a rescue swimmer of right-wing, presumably anti-immigrant views, who nevertheless weeps as he recalls rescuing a child in accordance with ""the law of the sea"" (""no colors, no ethnic groups, no religions""); Bemnet, a young Eritrean fleeing conscription, who survives three weeks in a dinghy packed with dead companions he is too weak to throw overboard; Gabriella, an Italian doctor who, after assisting in a rescue in dangerous seas, can't prevent the saved men from dying of exposure on the long return to port; and Simone, a diver dispatched to explore the wreck of a boat that sank off Lampedusa with 250 people in the hold -- and whose account of his mission pointedly disqualifies staple disaster adjectives like ""traumatic"" and ""heartbreaking.""

Antony Shugaar's sensitive translation is marked by restraint, as if Enia is whispering at a wake and might well have preferred silence, in the tradition of the Sicilian male for whom ""the best word is the word you never said."" Scored on the page by the use (sometimes overuse) of one-line paragraphs and plentiful section breaks, this dignified brevity only rarely lapses into bathos (""Beneath the ashes of time smolder the embers of regret"").","In ""Notes on a Shipwreck,"" the Italian journalist Davide Enia bears witness to the suffering of migrants fleeing Africa for the island of Lampedusa.",70d57ebe-f3e1-5689-8644-4648a97a0dd3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/books/review/24HEIGHTON/24HEIGHTON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=79993c988c7d0c322ed55ee2600bcc0150492bc2b004f975cff4cbb196514fec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Migrants off Lampedusa, May 2017.",70d57ebe-f3e1-5689-8644-4648a97a0dd3,N24News/imgs/70d57ebe-f3e1-5689-8644-4648a97a0dd3.jpg,13
Media,Hollywood's Shaky Summer Box Office Points to Larger Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/01/business/media/summer-box-office-movies.html,"A movie theater in Bronxville, N.Y. ""Yesterday"" was the sleeper hit of the summer, costing about $26 million to make and collecting $135 million worldwide.

LOS ANGELES -- This was supposed to be the summer when Hollywood blew the doors off theaters. Stay home and stream? Not with Simba, Spider-Man, John Wick, Snowball, Buzz Lightyear, Aladdin, the X-Men and Godzilla on the way. Instead, the film business finds itself lagging last year's surge and facing questions about why. Some box office analysts point to 20th Century Fox, which imploded in Rupert Murdoch's handoff to Disney and delivered three bombs in a row. Others say moviegoing has become too expensive -- concessions, tickets, babysitters -- especially given the growing array of low-priced at-home entertainment options that are often already part of a household's budget. Or is something bigger going on? ""It is another sign that the broader economy is in a fragile place,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, noting that some other leisure businesses -- Disney theme parks, Major League Baseball games -- also had a soft summer. From the first weekend in May to Labor Day, a period that can account for as much as 40 percent of annual movie ticket sales, box office revenue in the United States and Canada is expected to total about $4.32 billion, a 2 percent decline from the same period last year, according to Comscore.

For the year, revenue from ticket sales is down 6.3 percent, which roughly translates to a 5 percent decline in attendance. That is despite the runaway success of ""Avengers: Endgame,"" the Disney-Marvel superhero movie that arrived in late April and collected a record-breaking $2.8 billion worldwide, nearly $860 million of that in North America. The specialty box office has been in particularly rough shape. Between January and Aug. 25, combined ticket sales for the 20 largest art film distributors (Fox Searchlight, Magnolia and the like) fell 45 percent from the same period last year, according to Box Office Mojo data. The movie business ebbs and flows depending on factors that vary from reviews to the weather. Ticket sales soared 15 percent last summer in part because of pent-up demand; the ""Incredibles"" series from Pixar returned after a 14-year hiatus, and ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was the first studio movie in 25 years to tell a contemporary Asian story. The art-house sector is extra-dependent on quality, and distributors say gems have been in short supply lately, in part because Netflix has snapped up so many of them (for premium prices).

But box office experts say the theatrical landscape has shifted, possibly permanently. Before it drowned in red ink, MoviePass, the cut-rate ticket subscription service, trained fans (especially younger ones) to expect deep discounts. Streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime have also proliferated, offering huge catalogs of movies and shows for a comparatively low price. At this point, many living rooms are equipped with large flat-screen televisions. Netflix charges $13 a month for its standard plan. Disney Plus, a service dedicated to everything Disney, Pixar, ""Star Wars,"" National Geographic and Marvel, will arrive in homes on Nov. 12 and cost $7 a month. For a comparison, standard movie tickets cost $16 to $18 in New York and Los Angeles; IMAX screenings run about $22. ""Pricing was never an impediment to going to the movies, and it is now,"" said Chris Aronson, a former distribution chief for 20th Century Fox who now runs his own consultancy. ""Streaming services have come along with such attractively priced entertainment that theaters can't compete, except on a handful of event movies that people absolutely must see.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Out-of-home entertainment had a down summer in general. Attendance at Major League Baseball games is expected to fall for the fourth consecutive season, according to Two Circles, a sports marketing agency. Broadway attendance has declined 2.6 percent from a year earlier, according to the Broadway League. Full data was not yet available for concerts, but early numbers suggest a decline, according to statistics from Pollstar, a trade publication.

""Recreation is, of course, a discretionary purchase, and that it has gone soft reflects greater caution by consumers,"" Mr. Zandi said. On a studio-by-studio basis, Hollywood's summer was severely lopsided. The top 10 movies generated $2.57 billion in domestic ticket sales, and Disney commanded 51 percent of that total -- with just three films: ""The Lion King,"" ""Toy Story 4"" and ""Aladdin."" The No. 1 movie of the summer was ""The Lion King,"" a remake that took in $523.5 million in North America and $1 billion overseas (and is still playing). Disney was humbled, however, by the performance of its newly acquired 20th Century Fox division, which delivered a hall-of-fame bomb: ""Dark Phoenix,"" an X-Men movie, cost an estimated $350 million to make and market and collected $252 million worldwide, roughly half of which goes to theater owners. Two other Fox movies, ""Stuber"" and ""The Art of Racing in the Rain,"" also fizzled at the box office. All were well in the works before the Disney deal. Sony Pictures Entertainment accomplished a unique feat, releasing a juggernaut superhero sequel, ""Spider-Man: Far From Home,"" and a completely original blockbuster, ""Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood."" No other studio showed that range. ""We believe in balance, and you can see this exact strategy in the rest of our year,"" said Thomas E. Rothman, Sony's movie chief, noting the ""Jumanji"" sequel and an original drama, ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,"" which stars Tom Hanks as the television personality Fred Rogers. ""As strong as the audience is for superheroes and sequels, we limit ourselves to serving that audience at our peril,"" Mr. Rothman said. ""It will ultimately narrow the business. We have to think about every audience.""

""Sequels and remakes that do not bring something different, original and outstanding are going to lose their audience fast,"" said David A. Gross, who runs Franchise Entertainment Research, a movie consultancy. Otherwise, Universal mostly succeeded. A high-stakes ""Fast and Furious"" spinoff, ""Hobbs & Shaw,"" has chugged away in theaters since arriving in early August, taking in roughly $700 million worldwide. Comedies, which have struggled in theaters in the streaming age, also came through for Universal, in particular the Beatles-themed ""Yesterday.""

Science,"Robert P. Langlands Is Awarded the Abel Prize, a Top Math Honor",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/science/robert-langlands-abel-prize-mathematics.html,"In 1967, Robert P. Langlands set out a road map to prove a ""grand unified theory"" that would tie together disparate areas of mathematics. The conjectures of Dr. Langlands, now 81 and an emeritus professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., have proven fertile ground for mathematical advances in the past half-century. And although his suppositions remain far from fully proven, the Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters announced on Tuesday that Dr. Langlands was this year's winner of the Abel Prize, which many view as a Nobel Prize of mathematics. ""He's a visionary,"" said Sun-Yung Alice Chang, a mathematician at Princeton University who served on the five-member prize committee. The panel reviewed more than 100 candidates before selecting Dr. Langlands, Dr. Chang said. There is no Nobel Prize in mathematics. (Contrary to myth, that is not because of an affair between a mathematician and Alfred Nobel's wife. For one, Nobel never married.)

For decades, the most prestigious math awards were the Fields Medals, but they are limited to mathematicians 40 years or younger, to recognize the promise of future discoveries as well as work already accomplished. The Fields medals are also only given out every four years. The Abel Prize, first awarded in 2003, honors a lifetime of mathematical work and influence. It is named after Niels Henrik Abel, a Norwegian mathematician. Previous winners include Andrew J. Wiles, a mathematician now at the University of Oxford who proved Fermat's Last Theorem; Peter D. Lax of New York University; and John F. Nash Jr., whose life was portrayed in the movie ""A Beautiful Mind."" In an interview in 2010, Dr. Langlands, who was born in New Westminster, Canada, near Vancouver, recalled that even though he skipped a grade, he had no intention of going to college until a teacher ""took up an hour of class time to explain to me, in the presence of all the other students, that it would be a betrayal of God-given talents for me not to attend university."" At the age of 16, he enrolled at the University of British Columbia, and he later pursued his doctoral studies at Yale.

Dr. Langlands made use of this type of analysis in curved spaces of higher dimensions (that is, more than the three dimensions of the world we live in) to address fundamental problems in the theory of numbers. In 1967, Dr. Langlands spoke with Andre Weil, a prominent French mathematician then at the nearby Institute for Advanced Study, who told him to put his thoughts in writing. The result was 17 pages, handwritten. ""After I wrote it I realized there was hardly a statement in it of which I was certain,"" Dr. Langlands wrote apologetically. ""If you are willing to read it as pure speculation I would appreciate that; if not -- I am sure you have a wastebasket handy.""

Dr. Weil had the letter typed up, and it circulated among other mathematicians, becoming what was known as the ""Langlands program."" Dr. Langlands proved a few pieces of it; others have solved additional special cases. Dr. Langlands's work, for instance, served as one of the starting points in the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by Dr. Wiles of Oxford. Pierre de Fermat, a 17th century French mathematician, had asserted that equations of the form an + bn = cn, where a, b, c and n are positive integers, have no solutions when n is greater than two.

""He never got a Fields medal,"" said Peter C. Sarnak, a mathematician at the institute said of Dr. Langlands. ""But many people have got Fields Medals for settling special cases of his conjectures, relying on his tools to start off."" The Abel committee contacted Dr. Sarnak a few days ago as a sort of spy to check that Dr. Langlands would be around to receive the news on Monday morning, a day before the official announcement.

Sports,N.F.L. Playoff Predictions: Our Picks for the Divisional Round,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/sports/football/nfl-playoffs-divisional-picks.html,"After an N.F.L. wild-card round in which both No. 6 seeds advanced and three teams won on the road, the bar is set awfully high for this weekend's action. Enter Baltimore, San Francisco, Kansas City and Green Bay, which just spent a bye week resting and plotting a course to the conference championship games. Here are our predictions for how the divisional round games will sort out, with all picks made against the spread. Last weekend's record against the spread: 2-1-1.

No. 6 Minnesota Vikings at No. 1 San Francisco 49ers, 4:35 p.m., NBC Thanks to an all-around effort on both sides of the ball, the Vikings (10-6) pulled off the biggest upset of the wild-card round, eliminating the New Orleans Saints, thus establishing themselves as the feel-good team of the postseason. But the importance of the 49ers' first-round bye cannot be overstated. Thanks to the week off, the 49ers (13-3) should have Dee Ford (hamstring) back at edge rusher, thus sorting out the rotation on their defensive line, and Jaquiski Tartt (rib) back at safety, fortifying their secondary.

Those reintroductions were expected, but in one that wasn't, linebacker Kwon Alexander, who tore his pectoral muscle in Week 9, is potentially coming off the injured reserve list for the game. Alexander, like many of his teammates, tends to struggle with run defense, but his coverage skills at linebacker are among the best in the league. His presence alone could force Vikings running back Dalvin Cook into a more one-dimensional role than the one he inhabited last weekend, when he rushed for 94 yards and gained 36 through the air.

With those key defenders back, San Francisco can do what it does best: Send some combination of Nick Bosa, DeForest Buckner, Arik Armstead and Ford at the quarterback on nearly every play, and let Richard Sherman lead a secondary more than capable of holding its coverage for an extended period. That Vikings wide receivers Adam Thielen (ankle) and Stefon Diggs (illness) will potentially play at less than 100 percent makes life even more difficult for quarterback Kirk Cousins. Minnesota's defense is hardly a group of pushovers, but San Francisco's run-heavy approach should be effective, and quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo has shown some creativity in getting the ball to his receivers and to his favorite weapon, tight end George Kittle. This game seems like an obvious win for San Francisco. Of course, the same could have been said of New Orleans. Pick: 49ers -7

No. 6 Tennessee Titans at No. 1 Baltimore Ravens, 8:15 p.m., CBS The aesthetics are not similar, but the strategy for both the Titans (9-7) and the Ravens (14-2) has been well established: Run the ball, run the ball more, run the ball a few more times, then catch the defense sleeping with a big passing play. It may not be Sean McVay or Kliff Kingsbury's idea of a modern and sophisticated approach to offense, but it is hard to argue with the results.

Led by quarterback Lamar Jackson -- who should set a reminder on his phone to pick up his Most Valuable Player Award on Feb. 1 -- the Ravens were the No. 1 rushing team in the N.F.L. But saying they were No. 1 almost sells them short. Baltimore's 3,296 rushing yards were the most in N.F.L. history, and 1,073 more than Tennessee managed despite the Titans finishing third in the league. Almost as a side note, Jackson, who set a single-season record for rushing yards by a quarterback, also led the N.F.L. in passing touchdowns with 36. Tennessee will do its best to counter the Ravens with a power running game led by Derrick Henry and a vertical passing attack led by Ryan Tannehill. Based on how things typically played out for the Titans this season, the expectation should be for Baltimore to build up an early lead and for Tennessee to claw its way back to respectability. The prospect of an upset is remote, and Tennessee's season will almost assuredly end, but it is hard to believe that Titans Coach Mike Vrabel will allow his team to go out quietly in a blowout. Pick: Titans +10

In Week 6, however, things did not look so good for the team. They were beaten at home by the Texans (10-6), with quarterback Deshaun Watson outplaying Patrick Mahomes. It was Kansas City's second consecutive loss at Arrowhead Stadium, and came ahead of a stretch in which the Chiefs played two games without Mahomes thanks to a knee injury, during which they split the results. Since getting Mahomes back and in rhythm, Kansas City has found its groove on both sides of the ball, while Houston underperformed relative to its talent. The Texans very nearly lost an A.F.C. South division title that had seemed like a foregone conclusion over the season's first nine weeks. Watson is terrific, but it required an outrageous comeback, and a play for the ages, for him to get his team past Buffalo in overtime last weekend. That is not a likely scenario against the Chiefs. The Texans are a reasonable bet to cover the spread, but the chances of them winning are remote. Pick: Texans +10","Lamar Jackson is back, the 49ers are healthy, the Chiefs have built a surprising defense and the Packers are more than Aaron Rodgers.",2a58bdd3-95df-5ed2-b220-90b2333cba8e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/11/sports/10nflmatchups2-print/10nflmatchups-top-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b4a9c62d3d9b7672af53d565c29dd8652bc55b80a3f846fb6370e63d66874bdb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lamar Jackson was disappointing in his first N.F.L. playoff start, a loss to the Chargers last season.

Automobiles,Critics' Picks of 2011: Making Sense of a More Sensible Year,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/01/automobiles/picks-of-2011-making-sense-of-a-sensible-year.html,"STEADY growth and building momentum may not be the ideal ingredients of sexy headlines, but the cars we drove in 2011 still offered plenty to be optimistic about.

Among the year's highs were beautifully rendered family sedans and keenly balanced sports cars, but equally significant was the arrival of models -- from mainstream compacts to luxury-brand benchmarks -- that were as satisfying to drive as they were efficient.

A wave of new electric cars and plug-in hybrids are on the way, but the internal-combustion engine showed no signs of stepping aside. BMW did the once-unthinkable in offering a turbo 4 in its 5 Series; Ford replaced the thirsty base-level V-8 in its perennial best-seller, the F-150 pickup, with a smarter V-6.

As in past years, writers for these pages selected the cars they found most memorable in the previous 12 months. By no means a comprehensive list, it is rather an assessment of how well particular models fulfill their particular missions, and perhaps stir a driver's spirit along the way.

Fashion & Style,"The Most Diverse Fashion Season Ever on the Runway, but Not the Front Row",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/fashion/the-most-diverse-fashion-season-ever-on-the-runway-but-not-the-front-row.html,"The Most Diverse Fashion Season Ever on the Runway, but Not the Front Row

Of all the things that have stuck with me in the week since I returned from the fashion shows, reintegrating myself to real life, one of the most lingering was the diversity that was apparent on the runways. This was, by anecdotal observation and actual data, the most inclusive season ever, especially in New York, where models of almost every color, as well as many sizes, ages and gender identities, were represented. Gone was the feeling I have had so many times in the past, that what I was seeing was merely gestural -- a nod to a trend, or political pressure, soon to be forgotten when fashion turned its focus somewhere else. This wasn't Joan Smalls and Adwoa Aboah on every single runway; it wasn't tokenism. There were multiple women of multiple shades on multiple runways. We had reached a point of genuine change. ""Spring 2019 was the most racially diverse season ever,"" said Jennifer Davidson, the editor in chief of The Fashion Spot, an online editorial platform that has been tracking runway diversity counts on race since September 2014, and on size, gender identification and age since September 2015. This was true in every city, with models of color in New York reaching almost 50 percent. Overall, preliminary numbers show that out of 229 shows and 7,432 models, 36.1 percent were models of color compared with 30.02 percent the same time a year ago and 17 percent when the tally began.

But all of these visuals also served to highlight another reality: What was true on the runway was not, necessarily, true behind it. The contrast between the diversity of the models and the uniformity of the people watching them was striking. Not in terms of celebrity guests -- Amandla Stenberg and Spike Lee were popular invites -- but in terms of the industry power structure itself: the editors, retailers and decision makers. The runway may have become the front line of diversity, but it definitely is not the end. ""It's something I think about when I go to work every day,"" said Samira Nasr, the executive fashion director of Vanity Fair, and one of the few women of color in the front row. (She is of Trinidadian and Lebanese descent.) In a career that in the last two decades has included stints at Vogue, InStyle and Elle, Ms. Nasr has often found herself among only a handful of fashion editors of color in her offices. ""This is a starting point,"" said Edward Enninful, who became the first black editor of any Vogue (and, for that matter, any major fashion glossy) when he was named to the top spot at British Vogue in 2017. ""But there's still a long way to go."" For years it was Andre Leon Talley, the onetime creative director of American Vogue, who was, as a New Yorker article famously called him in 1994, ""the Only One"" -- the only black man in the front row of most fashion shows. More than 20 years later, Mr. Talley celebrated Mr. Enninful's appointment but noted, in an interview with The New York Times earlier this year, that he still finds himself in fashion rooms where he asks, ""Where are the black people?""

[For more coverage of race, sign up here to have our Race/Related newsletter delivered weekly to your inbox.] And this is true not only for glossy magazines. Design houses are still notably lacking in racial diversity at the top. Hence the brouhaha over Virgil Abloh being named artistic director for Louis Vuitton men's wear earlier this year. Along with Olivier Rousteing, the creative director of Balmain, he is one of the few designers of color at the head of a French heritage house. (At the end of Mr. Abloh's first Vuitton show, in the gardens of the Palais-Royal, which was attended by his former creative collaborator Kanye West, both men were overcome by emotion.) In June, for the first time, the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards ceremony was hosted by a woman of color, Issa Rae. ""Which is crazy,"" she said. Most of the attention on diversity in fashion has been focused on the way its image is communicated to the outside world -- hence the obsessive tracking of models. Ms. Davidson, of The Fashion Spot, said that the site had decided to do the diversity reports to ""look at it through a consumer's eye, and focus on how brands represent themselves and who they choose to represent. If I'm a consumer, do I see myself on this runway?"" There is no question that that matters. But it's also dangerous, because it can lead to complacency; to the sense the issue is solved, or has been addressed. It looks so much better! ""Looks"" being the operative word. Now, according to Mr. Enninful, it is time for behind-the-scenes change. ""It's the next step,"" he said. ""We need more internships. Youth programs. The way people get into the industry needs to be widened."" Mr. Enninful added that he felt a responsibility to be a visible representation of what was possible, and a public figure for the next generation, whether on social media or in the front row.

""It's about letting people who have never been included in this industry know that it exists,"" Ms. Nasr said. ""I am very aware that I, as a brown woman, have this incredible platform."" Though it may be a natural conclusion that once you change the top, the bottom will follow -- that there will be a trickle-down effect -- Ms. Davidson cautions against any such assumption. ""There were Asian designers in New York who had the least diverse runways,"" she said. ""You'd think being in a minority would make you more sensitive to representing the breadth of the population, but our data does not support that."" Nevertheless, Ms. Nasr believes that simply by attrition, if not intent, things are changing. That a new generation is on the rise that looks more like the population they serve, like Tyler Mitchell, the young black photographer who became the first African-American to shoot a cover of Vogue in the magazine's 125-year history when he shot Beyonce for the September issue. Or Shaniqwa Jarvis, who has photographed ad campaigns for Liberty of London, Supreme and Nike; or Nikki Ogunnaike, the style director of Elle.com; or Lacy Redway, a hairstylist who works with Ruth Negga and Priyanka Chopra, among others. Ms. Nasr is ""really hopeful"" about the future. Indeed, on Wednesday Conde Nast announced that Lindsay Peoples Wagner would become the editor in chief of Teen Vogue, a title previously held by Elaine Welteroth -- who, when she was named to the post in 2016, was only the second African-American editor of a Conde Nast magazine in the United States. (Keija Minor of Brides was the first; Ms. Peoples Wagner is the third.) Formerly the fashion editor of New York magazine, she is the author of a widely read article published earlier this year, ""Everywhere and Nowhere,"" which explored ""what it's really like to be black and work in fashion.""","Let's not forget that when it comes to behind-the-scenes power brokers, there's still a long way to go.",66f42697-c910-5e0b-aa36-412ec46cfff6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/11/fashion/11diversity-1/11diversity-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fda18aedccdaec797027d9472c31100c27d53307c34af1d87d9e49d1a289f97f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A model walks the runway at Tom Ford in September during New York Fashion Week.,66f42697-c910-5e0b-aa36-412ec46cfff6,N24News/imgs/66f42697-c910-5e0b-aa36-412ec46cfff6.jpg,19
Health,There Before Ebola Had a Name,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/07/health/there-before-ebola-had-a-name.html,"Dr. Peter Piot was just 27, a budding virologist with a thirst for adventure, when he was dispatched to the heart of Africa to track down a terrifying virus that he had helped discover. It was 1976, and the virus had arrived at his laboratory in Antwerp, Belgium, in a blue plastic cooler holding two glass tubes of blood. They had been sent from Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo) by a doctor caring for a Flemish nun who was dying of fever and loss of blood. One tube was intact. The other was broken; its contents mingled with melted ice to form a red soup. A bloodstained note said the nun was among 200 people, including doctors and nurses, dying in an outbreak that had raged for three weeks in remote Yambuku, not far from the Ebola River. The prime suspect was yellow fever, a mosquito-borne infection that Dr. Piot's laboratory at the Institute of Tropical Medicine was equipped to detect. But unknown to anyone then, the nun's blood harbored the virus that was soon to be named Ebola.

They removed small amounts of blood from the intact tube to carry out routine tests for known microbes and special tests for yellow fever, along with hemorrhagic-fever viruses like Lassa, Marburg and dengue. They also injected the nun's blood into cells grown in the laboratory and the brains of mice. The tests excluded all known infectious agents, but Dr. Piot assumed that whichever one had caused the nun's illness must have been destroyed during the airplane trip from Zaire. Still, he and his colleagues checked the mice each day. After a week, all the mice were dead, strongly hinting that the infectious agent had not been destroyed after all. An autopsy showed that the nun's liver had microscopic lesions that Dr. Piot's boss, Dr. Stefaan Pattyn, knew to occur in Lassa fever. But because Lassa had already been ruled out, Dr. Pattyn steered the research toward identifying a new one.

At the time, only three laboratories outside the Soviet Union were equipped to handle deadly viruses safely: Porton Down, near London; Fort Detrick, a military base in Maryland; and what is now known as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. The World Health Organization instructed the Belgians to immediately send the samples in tightly sealed containers to Porton Down, which, in turn, forwarded them to the C.D.C. because it was the world's reference laboratory for hemorrhagic viruses. The Antwerp scientists kept part of the material and looked at it through an electron microscope. It showed that the nun's virus was a new one -- wormlike, and huge as viruses go -- that resembled Marburg. C.D.C. scientists then confirmed the Antwerp team's discovery and named the virus Ebola.

Dr. Piot's wife was three months pregnant with their first child. Yet scientific curiosity fueled his desire to go to Zaire to undertake the epidemiologic investigations to determine how this new virus spread. The Belgian government said it lacked funds for such travel -- until politics and scientific competition intervened. As American, French and South African scientists who knew about the findings headed to Zaire, the Belgian government realized it would be shutting out its own scientists, and it rushed Dr. Piot to its former colony to study the virus. Two Belgian nuns with Ebola had been evacuated from Yambuku to Kinshasa, Zaire's capital, and the specter loomed of an imminent, uncontrolled epidemic of Ebola among the millions living there and beyond. In the few hours he had before his plane left, Dr. Piot raced to amass as much protective gear as he could take along. In Zaire, he joined an international team of scientists who flew to Yambuku and mapped Ebola's spread, determining that the principal route was through unsterilized needles and syringes, contact with infected patients and touching bodies at funerals. They also collected blood from patients for later testing and prepared for the arrival of a larger and better-equipped team to control the outbreak.

Dr. Piot, who has told much of this story in previous interviews with me and in his 2012 memoir, ""No Time to Lose: A Life in Pursuit of Deadly Viruses,"" expanded on it in a recent interview in light of the current epidemic in West Africa, the deadliest Ebola outbreak in history. He said he expected discovery of more viruses like Ebola. And despite today's much safer laboratory procedures, he added, such virulent pathogens could prove just as dangerous. ""We were lucky not to get infected, not only in the laboratory but later on when I was drawing blood from patients and touching them,"" Dr. Piot said from England, where he is now the director of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. He was lucky in another way. In 1976, ordered to fly in a waiting helicopter to meet with visiting Belgian officials in Kinshasa, he smelled alcohol on the pilots' breaths and refused to go.

Despite the near-misses, ""what dominated was the absolute excitement of discovery,"" he said, adding: ""I didn't realize that we were making history in those days,"" and ""I never imagined that Ebola would become a real public-health problem because until now, the outbreaks, as dramatic as they may have been, have been fairly limited."" Dr. Piot played a key role in another epidemic. He went to Zaire to investigate cases soon after AIDS was first recognized in the United States in 1981. Later, he directed the United Nations AIDS program for 10 years. This July, the normally cautious Dr. Piot sounded one of the first alarms that the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was out of control. He publicly called it ""a mega-crisis"" that required militarylike logistics and control measures like isolation and quarantine of infected individuals and their contacts. He worried that his message about the world's tardy response to control Ebola might be hyperbolic, he said, but that he ""would rather be accused of overreacting than responding too late or not doing enough."" Now he believes he was ""on target."" But when asked about health organizations' widely varying projections of the extent of the current Ebola epidemic -- one worst-case estimate said it could reach 1.4 million -- he said he ""would definitely take them with a big grain of salt"" because they are ""not based on accurate current data, so there are too many unknowns."" Dr. Piot returned to Yambuku to celebrate his 65th birthday in February, a month before Ebola was first identified in Guinea. Since then, he has not gone to the affected areas in West Africa because of his duties at the tropical medicine school. But there, driven by moral and practical issues, Dr. Piot has set up one of the rare programs to ensure that faculty and staff members who go to West Africa to work on Ebola will continue to be paid, and 163 have expressed interest in volunteering, he said. ""The mortality to medical staff and nurses has been enormous and devastating,"" he told me. ""Our colleagues are the most affected of all professions, paying a high price for their work, and also infecting others.""",Dr. Peter Piot helped discover a deadly virus in 1976 and warned about its spread. Now he is providing help for a new outbreak.,d3cee03f-e482-5f58-a56c-a421d03d01d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/07/science/07DOCS/07DOCS-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=900&w=600&s=8b07fee48111e01e36d5a57084817ab23098dd63b054ab59c5c415d6b2b395d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Dr. Peter Piot recalled ""the absolute excitement of discovery.""",d3cee03f-e482-5f58-a56c-a421d03d01d2,N24News/imgs/d3cee03f-e482-5f58-a56c-a421d03d01d2.jpg,1
Art & Design,"Museums With Such Good Taste (Meaning the Restaurant, Dear)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/arts/design/museums-serve-dinner-inspired-by-art.html,"As food becomes increasingly valuable cultural currency, American museums are using cooking to help visitors better connect to the art on the walls. When the Metropolitan Museum of Art was casting around last year for new ways to showcase its exhibition ""Jerusalem 1000-1400: Every People Under Heaven,"" it paired the Israeli chef and food writer Yotam Ottolenghi with the authors of ""The Gaza Kitchen"" for a 13-course medieval feast that took six months to plan. Laura McDermit, the manager of social experiences at the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh, took a similar approach with a program called Feast, which the museum began last year. A dinner prepared by Michael Gulotta, a New Orleans chef who draws from the cooking traditions of both Southeast Asia and Southeast Louisiana, was the debut event. The food underscored themes in ""The Living Need Light, The Dead Need Music,"" the Propeller Group's visual and musical exploration of South Vietnam's funerary tradition, which echo rituals in New Orleans.

In November, Ms. McDermit recruited the Brazilian chef Ana Luiza Trajano to cook eight courses inspired by the work of the Brazilian artist Helio Oiticica, whose first comprehensive retrospective in the United States hung at the museum from October through Jan. 2. Each event, which cost $250 a head and seated 150 people, sold out in a snap. ""We see food becoming more important as museums try to create a complete experience for people,"" Ms. McDermit said. ""Food, at its base level, is this way to sustain ourselves. Art is a way we sustain the higher levels of our needs."" Programs that bring people together over food and art are on the rise, she and others said. The evidence, both large and small, is everywhere. A menu at the new cafe at the Gibbes Museum of Art in Charleston, S.C., draws on the region's antebellum rice-belt culture with dishes partly inspired by a current exhibition of Jacob Lawrence prints. In Manhattan, curators at the Museum of Chinese in America are exploring Chinese food and immigrant identity through the stories of 33 home cooks and chefs in ""Sour, Sweet, Bitter, Spicy: Stories of Chinese Food and Identity in America,"" an exhibition that mixes videos with an oversize dinner table. The table holds artifacts from the cooks' kitchens and vessels that link regional cooking traditions. The show has been so popular that the museum has extended its run through September.

In Cincinnati, the Contemporary Arts Center last year published a cookbook titled ""Cuisine, Art, Cocktails: Celebrating Contemporary Cincinnati."" Chefs were asked to create dishes inspired by an artist whose work had been featured at the center. David Cook used Robert Mapplethorpe's photograph ""Calla Lily"" as the basis for a dessert based on meringues, vanilla custard and a soup made from passion fruit and saffron. ""What we're seeing across the board is a desire for experiences over things, so we are seeing gastronomy being used as a way to round out the experience and create a deeper, richer engagement,"" said Ari Wiseman, the deputy director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Although Guggenheim museums are focused on visual art, everything from coffee bars to programming is designed to create places for dialogue that can be social, educational and gastronomic, he said. As food reaches increasingly into exhibitions, art is moving into museum restaurants as well. When the restaurateur Danny Meyer opened the Modern in the Museum of Modern Art in 2005, the notion of a destination American restaurant inside a major art museum seemed groundbreaking. For decades, museum directors hadn't seemed to think that food had a place in museums. When the Metropolitan Museum of Art opened its first large cafeteria in 1954, it did so grudgingly. Now museum restaurants have blossomed into destinations and showplaces, with notable chefs who have been recognized with Michelin stars and James Beard Foundation awards. Their menus are often inspired by collections, and restaurant walls have become gallery space. In January, the Guggenheim's Wright restaurant in New York unveiled four pieces by the American abstract artist Sarah Crowner, who produced both paintings and tile works for the space. At the Brooklyn Museum, diners at the Norm are surrounded by paintings and the shipping crates they came in.

The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art has taken things a step further with In Situ, a restaurant that opened in its lobby in June. The chef Corey Lee uses the menu as a way to interpret the best dishes from the world's greatest chefs. Managers encourage visitors to think of the restaurant as an art installation, with the food serving as both the medium and the inspiration for global cultural exploration. Two Washington museums run by the Smithsonian Institution have forged an even deeper connection between menu and mission. At both the Mitsitam Cafe in the National Museum of the American Indian, which opened in 2004, and at the Sweet Home Cafe inside the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened last summer, food is an extension of the collection. At the African-American museum, five stations in the cafe have been designed to tell the story of the African diaspora in the United States. Dishes like catfish po' boys and a Caribbean pepper pot help define the culture of Creole coastal communities. The story of the Underground Railroad is illuminated through a traditional New York City oyster pan roast inspired by Thomas Downing, the son of freed slaves who opened a popular oyster restaurant on Broad Street in Manhattan in the early 1800s. He also hid escaped slaves in its basement. It is what Dr. Jessica Harris, whose research provided the intellectual architecture for the cafe's food, called ""a gustatory continuation of the lessons learned."" Art and food have been linked forever, said Susan H.

Television,9 Things We Still Want to Know Now That 'Game of Thrones' Is Over,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/20/arts/television/game-of-thrones-finale-questions-nights-watch.html,"9 Things We Still Want to Know Now That 'Game of Thrones' Is Over

This article contains spoilers for the series finale of ""Game of Thrones."" We couldn't expect every question to be answered, every subplot to be resolved, every character to get a proper goodbye. But Sunday's ""Game of Thrones"" finale certainly tried to tie a bow on as much of the story as possible. Still, a lot of questions were left unanswered -- fodder, perhaps, for any ""Game of Thrones"" sequels that may arise in addition to the prequels. (Arya west of Westeros? John north of the North?) Here are a few we're still wondering about. [Read the recap of the ""Game of Thrones"" series finale.] Why Is There a Night's Watch? ""There's still a Night's Watch?"" Jon Snow asked Tyrion when he learned he was being banished to the Wall. Fair question. The White Walkers are wiped out. The wildlings are allies. The Wall is destroyed near Eastwatch, and the various castles along the Wall are unmanned. Is there any point in restoring them? Eastwatch at least, given its seaside location, could be rebuilt as a port town and trading center. In any case, it's not entirely clear what someone sentenced to the Night's Watch might be required to do. What is its function now beyond leading the Free Folk home?

We got to see Ned Stark's companion Howland Reed only in the Tower of Joy flashback, and we heard about his legendary exploits only when Bran Stark discussed them with the Three-Eyed Raven and the Reed siblings. What happened to that guy? In addition to being one of the few people in Westeros who knows Jon Snow's true parentage (not from a vision, but from lived history), Lord Reed is also a loyal vassal to House Stark -- so loyal that his children, Jojen and Meera, risked their lives to help Bran on his mystical journey. And yet House Reed was absent from the discussions about defending Winterfell, and it hasn't been heard from since Bran brushed off Meera with barely a thank you. We're still wondering about Jojen's visions, which suggested a fiery exit for Bran and Meera: ""This isn't the end,"" he said. ""Not for you. Not yet."" [Fans of 'Game of Thrones' griped about the finale's pointy end.] Dorne Is Not Done Very late in the game, we got a brief mention from Varys that there was a new prince of Dorne. But who is he? How did he come to power when all the men in the Martell line were thought to have been assassinated by Ellaria Sand and the Sand Snakes? That's true of all the men mentioned in the show. But there are more in the books, among them Quentyn Martell. Since the show didn't properly identify this new prince, are we expected to assume that it's Quentyn? Who Was the Voice in the Flames? Varys never got to learn what the voice in the flames said when a sorcerer used his body parts in a magical ritual. Kinvara once offered to tell him, but never did. And now we'll never know.

We never really got to visit many of the places in this world, but of the few we did, it would have been nice to learn what happened to a few of the locals we met along the way. In Pentos, for example, did Illyrio Mopatis, who hosted Viserys and Dany in Season 1 and Varys and Tyrion in Season 5, regret supporting a Targaryen restoration? In Qarth, did Quaithe, who seemed to have the power of premonition, ever take one last mystic look at Dany? In Braavos, did Jaqen H'ghar, who taught Arya much of her craft, ever hear about the exploits of his favorite pupil? In Meereen, did Daario Naharis succeed in keeping the peace, despite having no real interest in doing so? Did Salladhor Saan ever recover the ships that Stannis borrowed? So many of these ancillary characters and their subplots were discarded by the show as it narrowed its focus and lost interest in the lands across the Narrow Sea. Back in Season 6, Arya wondered, ""What's west of Westeros?"" and now that is her destination. Anything across the Sunset Sea is uncharted territory. The only known voyage there in the books was led by Elissa Farman, whom Dany had to thank for her dragon eggs, which Elissa stole from Dreamfyre to finance her trip. Elissa long believed that there were undiscovered lands west of Westeros, and her crew first sailed south by southwest and found three exotic islands. She then headed west and was never seen again. Her ship, however, was spotted many years later in Asshai, which suggested that it might be possible to reach Essos by sailing west from Westeros. Perhaps one of the prequel successor shows will clear this up. Or maybe Arya will get her own spinoff. Despite not having mentioned his wife for many years, Davos is still a married man as far as we know. Effectively, he abandoned his wife to go off to war with Stannis, then with Jon Snow, then with Dany. But did he return home to her after the Battle of Blackwater to share her grief over the death of their only son? No. Before he joined Stannis in Braavos, did he send a raven to let his wife know when he'd be home (and perhaps surprise her with his newly acquired literacy)? No. When Jon Snow first took him to Dragonstone to meet with Dany, did Davos ask that they take a slight detour so he could check in at home? No. (Although he did find time to flirt with Missandei.) In all his travels back and forth across the continent, did Davos express concern for his wife at all? No. Isn't it strange that a man who cares so deeply for others -- treating Shireen like a daughter, Gendry like a son -- never brings up his own family? We can only imagine the reception when he finally goes home.

Among his many exploits, Sam Tarly killed a White Walker, and then a Thenn, and then stole several books from the restricted section of the Citadel library. Did the maesters ever notice they were missing? Will he face any repercussions for this theft? Did becoming grand maester erase his late fees? Also, if Sam helped Archmaester Ebrose write ""The Chronicles of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert I,"" now titled ""A Song of Ice and Fire,"" why wouldn't Tyrion be mentioned? It seems that much of what we've learned about the true history of Westeros may remain hidden from its people. The baker at the Inn at the Crossroads knows how to bring people together. Will he ever get to play the game of scones?",Why is there still a Night's Watch? And does Sam owe a bunch of library fees?,b86020ec-eda0-510b-9bf3-2e745b05f12a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/20/arts/20got-looseends/20got-looseends-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=ac0ab8f31eda5a80464d5968e3be56c68d470083acb3d2ecb0a95a3c59e7082f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""There's still a Night's Watch?""

Science,A New Viral Outbreak Is Killing Rabbits,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/18/science/virus-outbreak-rabbits.html,"There's another deadly virus outbreak in the U.S., but this one is killing thousands of wild rabbits. It started in New Mexico in March and has since spread to Texas, Arizona, Colorado, Nevada, California and Mexico. It poses a fatal threat to pets as well as wild animals.

The illness is caused by Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease Virus type 2 and does not affect humans or other animals, only rabbits, hares and perhaps pikas, a rabbit-like animal, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It is not a coronavirus.

This is the first outbreak of the virus in wild rabbits in North America, but there have been other, smaller outbreaks among domestic rabbits in Ohio, Washington and New York, and in feral rabbits in Canada -- pets that have escaped or been released and continue to breed. The pet and feral animals are descendants of European rabbits, not native to North America.

Ralph Zimmerman, the state veterinarian in New Mexico, where the new outbreak started, said its origin is unknown. But, he added, imported domestic rabbits are one possibility; the disease was first identified in France in 2010 and spread throughout Europe and later Australia, where it swept the continent in about a year and a half. An outbreak at a New York veterinary clinic in March of this year killed 11 pet rabbits.","This virus is deadly, long-lived and highly contagious, but it doesn't affect people or other animals.",57fbcb9a-bd15-5f3c-a652-56001983dc8a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/18/science/18RABBITVIRUS/18RABBITVIRUS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=10b55ce00f6a1e90aa76bd1d33062ead0d2c4b7dfbfd6837f51a198d4fb67890&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An eastern cottontail rabbit in Big Bend National Park in southwest Texas.,57fbcb9a-bd15-5f3c-a652-56001983dc8a,N24News/imgs/57fbcb9a-bd15-5f3c-a652-56001983dc8a.jpg,2
Style,"New Mascot for the Hamptons: Mary Lee, the Great White Shark",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/11/style/mary-lee-great-white-shark-ocearch.html,"She is somewhere in her 40s or 50s, has more than 119,000 followers on Twitter (where she can sometimes be quite flirtatious) and enjoys summering along the Jersey Shore and the Hamptons. She weighs about 4,000 pounds and is around 17 feet long. If you're a seal or a squid, you had better be careful when she comes around. Meet Mary Lee, a great white shark identified in fall 2012 by Ocearch, an organization that researches and tracks marine species. In the five years since the team first pulled Mary Lee out of the waters near Cape Cod, in Massachusetts, to tag her and collect blood and tissue samples, she has traveled nearly 40,000 miles. Ocearch traces the path by plotting the pings that occur every time Mary Lee's dorsal fin surfaces; it is tagged with a device linked to a satellite. During the past three summers, Mary Lee has been a regular on the Northeastern Seaboard, cruising along the Jersey Shore and the Hamptons, Fire Island and Montauk, in New York, attracting the attention of residents and tourists with each visit.

""She has become sort of a mascot,"" said Andy Brosnan, the chairman of the Eastern Long Island chapter of the Surfrider Foundation. ""Even before she showed up last time, people were like, 'Has anybody seen anything about Mary Lee?'"" In June, Mary Lee appeared near Atlantic City. Though she surfaces often on Ocearch's interactive map, it is hard to say whether any person has actually encountered Mary Lee since the marine biologists dropped her back into the water in 2012. But even a map of Mary Lee's movements is enough to help scientists shed more light on a mysterious species.

For example, to find the location of a great white nursery last year, the Ocearch crew had to piece together several clues. ""We first got an idea of where the sharks were mating, and because females have an 18-month gestation period, you can follow them for 18 months and get an idea of where they're birthing,"" said Chris Fischer, the founder of Ocearch. From the group's work in the Pacific, they gathered that for great whites, mating occurs in late fall to early winter, which would mean birthing happens around May or June. In May of last year, Mary Lee traveled past Fire Island and into the waters off East Hampton, N.Y., leading the researchers to hypothesize that a nursery could be nearby. They found it not far from Montauk, where they tagged nine pups, allowing the researchers to trace the migratory patterns of great whites in their early years.

Neil Hammerschlag, a research assistant professor in the Shark Research & Conservation Program at the University of Miami, suggested that some of Mary Lee's popularity had to do more with the high-profile efforts of Ocearch and the category of shark that Mary Lee belongs to. ""Ocearch coupled a TV show with their work,"" Dr. Hammerschlag said, referring to the 2012 History Channel program ""Shark Wranglers,"" ""and they had a strong social media campaign."" And there is no denying that great white sharks are the ultimate predators. ""Great whites generate more public attention than other species,"" Dr. Hammerschlag said. ""They're responsible for the most fatalities on people worldwide. People are afraid of them, and this feeds the public's curiosity."" According to the International Shark Attack File, sharks attacked humans with no provocation 81 times in 2016. In contrast, an average of 3,536 unintentional drownings occur in the United States each year, according to federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Sharks strike an inherent survival instinct and a primal fear,"" Mr. Fischer said. ""Nobody wants to be eaten. But it's an irrational fear that doesn't statistically exist.""

""We're trying to undo everything that 'Jaws' did,"" he added. ""If we don't have a lot of Mary Lees, our children won't be able to eat fish sandwiches. If they go, the entire system goes."" The great white population on the Northeast Coast, which includes Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where ""Jaws"" was filmed, has rebounded in recent years. In 2003, scientists concluded that the great white population had dropped by 79 percent between 1986 and 2000. But conservation efforts in the 1990s, including a federal law prohibiting the removal of fins from sharks' bodies, have brought the creatures back within feeding distance of the Hamptons and Cape Cod. A resurgence of seals, a favored snack of the great white shark, may have encouraged the sharks' return, as well. ""All of a sudden they're in people's backyards, not in Australia or South Africa,"" Dr. Hammerschlag said. ""Great white sharks make news. Great white sharks in your backyard make news even more."" As for whether the fear that drives human fascination with great white sharks is justified, most people who study them agree that these predators are not out to have you for brunch. ""If white sharks wanted to eat humans, there would be tens of thousands of humans eaten every day,"" Mr. Fischer said. Dr. Hammerschlag is, however, taking no chances. ""Because they're large and can pose a risk to humans, I would generally not swim in a spot where you know sharks are,"" he said. ""It's the same as when you're driving on the highway and if you know there's a reckless or drunk driver. It's smart to not drive near them. But you're not going to stop driving on the highway altogether.""","She weighs about 4,000 pounds and has a considerable following on Twitter.

Opinion,"Clean Up Your Act, Facebook, or We're Leaving",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/opinion/facebook-zuckerberg-labeling.html,"""I put the dishes in the dishwasher,"" my son said to me recently, as if it was a favor rather than something he should do just because. This prompted me to write to you, Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook chief executive, with all the irritation of a mother whose last nerves were worked a long time ago when it comes to the abuses that thrive on your platform. I'd like to let you know: You get zero claps for doing a tiny right thing after doing the wrong thing for far too long. Last week, you announced that you are finally labeling the most egregious dreck that is broadcast on Facebook by President Trump, after years of his escalating behavior. But it's too little, too late. And it's too calculating. You and other Facebook executives keep hauling out the tired line, ""We know we have more work to do."" It's irksome. And you won't like me when I am irked.

You seem to be shifting toward labeling -- after insisting recently to your employees that you would not budge on this -- in reaction to a campaign to persuade advertisers to boycott your company, a movement known as Stop the Hate for Profit. After years of other forms of pressure that apparently failed, those who are seeking to force you to change are finally getting traction by focusing on your wallet, knocking billions off your net worth in recent days, as your stock price goes down. This fast-moving campaign -- organized by the N.A.A.C.P., the ADL, Color of Change and others -- is aimed directly at Facebook and has been joined by companies like Patagonia, REI and, most significantly, the consumer goods giant Unilever. Still, other companies, like Starbucks and Coca-Cola, are not joining Stop the Hate, but instead are declaring that they will cut off marketing on all of social media. As if all social media companies are equal. They are not. Allowing Facebook to get cover in a group will only end up hurting smaller companies like Snap and Twitter, both of which have tried to deal with this problem more actively. It's not fair to lump them in with you; they have fewer resources to withstand a marketing drought. Since Facebook and Google are the overwhelmingly dominant players in the game of digital advertising, the problem of hate and misinformation flowing on social media is yours to own. Your stranglehold on the ad business is undeniably the source of your power. I talked recently with some people running businesses that rely on Facebook, all of whom are scared to speak out publicly against your platform. Many compared your service to a bad relationship.

""I really cannot stand them at all,"" said a leader of a medium-size company that gets a lot of its leads on Facebook. But while he worries about the damage Facebook is doing to society, he added, ""I am going to keep marketing there because I have no choice."" No choice -- that's certainly why Starbucks did not get rid of its page on Facebook, where it posts content to close to 36 million followers. (Today, for example, you can ""start off your day with Cold Brew!"") I don't blame Starbucks or Coca-Cola or anyone with a business to run for not bailing on Facebook totally; all marketers need Facebook (and its Instagram unit) to operate in today's media environment. But I don't need you, since I am pretty sure that being on Facebook has never helped me at all. So, it is time to go. After years of inertia, and not much use of Facebook, this week I finally took the first big steps toward leaving, deactivating my personal page and unpublishing my brand page. This was a many-click process in which my decision was questioned by Facebook's pop-ups a lot more than I wanted my decision to be questioned (ARE YOU SURE? ARE YOU REALLY SURE?). I'm likely soon enough to delete the pages altogether, along with my Instagram account, once I figure out what to do with the material living there like boxes in a digital attic. As I deactivated, I was asked by Facebook why I was doing it, and I picked ""other"" from a long menu of reasons, many of which I would have clicked if I could have chosen more than one, including: I have a privacy concern; I don't feel safe on Facebook; I don't find Facebook useful. This column -- and the deactivation of my account -- is my way of cleaning up my world. But to say I am confident that you, Mark Zuckerberg, will do your part to clean up the rest of the world would be something of an overstatement. Facebook's still high stock price and your complete control over the company means you can and will continue to do as you please. And since you are not my kid -- yes, I know, lucky you! -- there is little I can do about it. Yet I do hope for progress, however painful it is for Facebook, its advertisers and the rest of us. Already this week, other big platforms have started to make long overdue changes in content policy, including banning an out-of-control Trump community (Reddit) and temporarily suspending Mr. Trump's account due to ""hateful content"" (Twitch).

One of the hallmarks of adulthood is the ability to evolve. My son is about to turn 16 (as Facebook did this year), and he's also learning how to do that, which has put me in the mind of something James Baldwin said: ""People pay for what they do, and still more for what they have allowed themselves to become. They pay for it very simply; by the lives they lead."" By which I mean to say, Mark, you need to put your dirty dishes in the dishwasher without my asking, just because.","The social media company has taken steps toward reining in Trump.

Sports,A Virtual HORSE Competition? B-O-R-I-N-G,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/13/sports/coronavirus-nba-horse-basketball.html,"Current and former N.B.A. and W.N.B.A. players competed in a virtual game of HORSE Sunday night on ESPN. The result? An air ball. When the competition was announced last week, sports fans were ecstatic to have something -- anything -- even resembling live basketball to watch. That excitement faded quickly as the competition dragged on. The videos, filmed by the players with their own cameras, were blurry, shaky and oftentimes awkwardly lagged. It was sometimes difficult for the viewer to tell if the shots, taken on the players' home courts, even went in. Sound quality was poor, and it was hard to understand the players' commentary.

The semifinal will be played Thursday. Chauncey Billups will face off against Mike Conley, and Zach LaVine will play Quigley. Andy Murray and his wife, Kim, have a challenge for tennis players: can you complete 100 straight volleys? The two failed the first time, but made it on their second try. They posted the video on Twitter, encouraging players and fans to try it themselves.

The tennis world responded. Professionals like Novak Djokovic and his wife, Jelena, tried the challenge, and then asked for another competition. ""We're here, we're available,"" Djokovic said. ""We have all the time in the world. This is the funnest part of the day."" It was a great chance for the young to show off their skills, and for the old to show that they still have it. And don't forget about the pets, who always find a way to be included. No partner? No problem. One fan did the challenge alone by tossing the ball back and forth between his racket. Other fans adapted the challenge by using their cellphones instead of a racket. Play ball! It's opening day. Ah, the smell of freshly mown grass, the crack of ash on horsehide, the cries of the Cracker Jack sellers ... sorry, we lost it there for a minute. Actually, the opening day to which we were referring is in Taiwan. Like basketball, baseball is back in Taiwan, where Covid-19 has been contained fairly successfully. The Uni Lions beat the Chinatrust Brothers on Sunday, 4-1, in 11 innings, and more games are scheduled Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. There were no fans in attendance, but President Tsai Ing-wen and her cat were pictured watching the game on television.

Both the men's and women's soccer leagues in Taiwan also got underway over the weekend. VICTOR MATHER Hammarby, a Swedish top-division soccer team, has resumed practicing. That would be exciting enough news for sports-starved fans, but making it all the more electrifying was the presence on Monday of the brilliant and colorful striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Ibrahimovic gets attention wherever he goes. And his presence with Hammarby started eyebrows rising and tongues wagging because of supposed friction between Ibrahimovic and his current team, A.C. Milan, which he joined in December after two years with the Los Angeles Galaxy. Could Hammarby, in his home country, be a final stop for the 38-year-old Ibrahimovic?","A rather uneventful game of HORSE involving pro players, plus 100 straight volleys, baseball in Taiwan, and training for a Swedish soccer team.",0415bb3c-870b-5b23-8713-bf574f45c534,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/13/sports/13nosports2/13nosports2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=8e2dd37f32eebd6e8482517e9f05eac013dcf9410b4b96d49fed7e8b12a58864&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Well, they tried.

Media,"In a Gleeful Twist at a Horror Film Screening, 'Blair Witch' Is Revived",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/business/media/in-a-gleeful-twist-at-a-horror-film-screening-blair-witch-is-revived.html,"SAN DIEGO -- The film was scary, but that's not why people at a sneak peek screening of a new horror movie called ""The Woods"" here on Friday night were screaming: In a master stroke of stunt marketing, it turned out that ""The Woods"" was not ""The Woods"" at all, but a top-secret Lionsgate sequel to ""The Blair Witch Project.""

There is nothing unusual about a studio trying to dust off an old franchise. (There were two ""Blair Witch"" movies, released in 1999 and 2000.) But Lionsgate's tactics in this instance were unorthodox. Lionsgate is betting that the payoff will come at the box office in September, with moviegoers drawn to the film because it feels both new and nostalgic -- in other words, not just another tired sequel.

First, the studio kept the sequel a secret by referring to it throughout a two-year development and production process only as ""The Woods."" Actors were given fake scripts at auditions. Everyone working on the film had to sign a nondisclosure agreement. Character names and details were changed in shooting scripts to prevent association with the ""Blair Witch"" world.

Technology,"Needing Growth, Uber Returns to Germany. This Time on Best Behavior.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/19/technology/uber-growth-ipo-germany.html,"The taxi lot at the Dusseldorf airport. Uber chose Dusseldorf as its re-entry point in Germany because thousands of people there were still opening the app even with no cars on the road.

DUSSELDORF, Germany -- Guido Goebel stopped driving for Uber three years ago when the company abandoned his hometown, the German city of Dusseldorf, after a battle with regulators. Several weeks ago, the ride-hailing service reached out to him again. Uber told Mr. Goebel that it was returning to Dusseldorf and offered him a bonus of 500 euros, or about $560, if he hit certain driving targets. ""It's good. I'm busy,"" Mr. Goebel, who had taken work driving patients to medical appointments, said from behind the wheel of a Mercedes-Benz C-Class. ""People are happy Uber is here."" Dusseldorf is the start of an effort by Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, to reboot its business in Germany ahead of a planned initial public offering next year. When Uber re-entered this city of 600,000 last month, it was its first expansion in Germany since 2015, when it left every town except Berlin and Munich.

The old no-holds-barred strategy ""clearly didn't work,"" and the product is now ""tailor made for the market,"" said Christoph Weigler, Uber's general manager in Germany. Germany is a test for whether Mr. Khosrowshahi can substantially bolster Uber's business in places where it has had a problematic history. Since taking over late last year, he has withdrawn Uber from unprofitable areas like Southeast Asia and Russia to cut the company's losses, which amounted to $1.07 billion in the third quarter. But Mr. Khosrowshahi must also show growth ahead of taking Uber public next year, in what would likely be one of the biggest-ever technology offerings. As a result, he is refocusing on Europe, where the company can typically charge higher fares.

The road back into Europe is likely to be difficult. In London, Uber's largest European market, the company fought off attempts to revoke its license but is now entangled in a lawsuit that would require it to pay a minimum wage and provide holiday time to drivers, who are freelancers. In Spain, taxi operators have successfully pressured politicians to limit how many Uber cars are on the road. Rules have also kept the company largely absent from Italy. ""They have identified Continental Europe as one of their major growth areas, but they are realizing once again that going abroad isn't easy,"" said Nils Stieglitz, president and managing director of the Frankfurt School of Finance and Management, who has tracked Uber's business.

Germany is a particular prize because it is the world's fourth-largest economy and the biggest in Europe, with several densely populated cities and an affluent, digitally savvy population. Yet the country has a tangle of licensing rules that make it hard to recruit independent drivers. Germany requires drivers to pass health and driving tests, as well as receive a business license that includes a bookkeeping exam. Another rule orders drivers to return to a home base between trips, limiting how many rides can be made. Car-pooling services are banned. Over the past year, Mr. Khosrowshahi has visited Germany twice to apologize for the company's past behavior and to lobby to change some of the transportation laws. In one encouraging sign for Uber, the government said in March that it would update its transportation policy, though the deliberations could take years. ""There are still aspects of the regulation that we think could be tweaked to make our model slightly more scalable,"" said Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, the head of Uber's operations in Europe.

Yet as Uber tries to muscle deeper into Germany after a three-year hiatus, it faces more competition. A service owned by BMW, DriveNow, lets people rent a car with an app for short trips around cities such as Berlin. Moia, a subsidiary of Volkswagen, is testing a ride-sharing bus service in Hamburg. MyTaxi, a taxi-dispatch app owned by Daimler, is also widely used. And there are fast-growing rivals such as Taxify, which provides rides in European cities. ""It's very hard for them to compete on so many fronts at once,"" Markus Villig, Taxify's chief executive, said of Uber. Unless Uber can win major changes to German regulations, he said, ""they are in a very tight spot."" Uber said it had selected Dusseldorf as its re-entry point for expanding in Germany after seeing that customers there had logged into its app more than 150,000 times since January, even though no cars were on the road. Dusseldorf, about 350 miles west of Berlin, is a business hub and home to popular festivals that draw travelers. One boisterous area of town, called ""The Longest Bar,"" has more than 260 bars and dance clubs. Uber knew it could not open in Dusseldorf as it had in 2014, when it first arrived. That year, Uber didn't bother warning local officials it was coming. One morning, the app simply went live, and anybody was free to transform his or her car into a taxi without a license.

In July, Uber contacted Mr. Matheisen and other Dusseldorf officials about trying again. The company vowed to follow all regulations by working with licensed drivers and taxi companies, and to make electric cars part of its fleet as a sign of good will for government efforts to fight air pollution. ""I was very skeptical because of what they did do in the past, but I was surprised by the new way of communicating with us,"" Mr. Matheisen said. By August, Uber was making final preparations to put cars back on the road. It opened an office in a co-working space in a downtown high-rise, where curious visitors can pop in to speak with staff about starting to drive. It plans to enter another German city, which it hasn't identified, by the end of the year and several more in 2019. Even after returning to Dusseldorf, Uber has faced an obstacle: taxi drivers. While the company has tried to work with taxi operators, dozens protested outside Uber's office last month, blasting their horns and snarling traffic. Dennis Klusmeier, head of the city's largest taxi dispatch company, Taxi Dusseldorf, said Uber drivers didn't comply with the law that requires private-hire drivers to return to a garage between rides. Holding a large law book that outlined German transportation rules, Mr. Klusmeier said he was exploring a legal challenge. Ufuk Demirel, an Uber driver in Dusseldorf who has completed more than 300 rides over the past month, said a taxi driver had recently swerved to cut him off. The Dusseldorf police said six incidents between taxi and Uber drivers had been reported, including one in which an Uber driver was forced to stop by taxi drivers, then verbally abused and harassed.

Beyond tensions with taxi drivers, Uber has to deal with customer awareness. About 100 Uber cars are on the road in Dusseldorf, and waits for a ride can be long. Ask people in the city whether they have ever used the app and you still get mostly shrugs. ""It's not so popular,"" said Dennis Zimney, who works at a downtown hotel. ""Most people don't know Uber.""",Uber retreated from many towns in Germany in 2015 after battling regulators.

Health,Sutter Health to Pay $575 Million to Settle Antitrust Lawsuit,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/health/sutter-health-settlement-california.html,"Sutter Health, the large hospital system in Northern California, said Friday that it had agreed to pay $575 million to settle claims of anti-competitive behavior brought by the California state attorney general as well as unions and employers.

In addition to the settlement amount -- which will go to compensate employers, unions and the state and federal governments -- Sutter will also be prohibited from engaging in several practices that the state attorney general and others said the hospital system used to ensure its dominance.

It will be barred from so-called ""all or nothing"" agreements, which the attorney general said required insurers to include all of Sutter's medical facilities if they wanted to include some of the system's hospitals. And it will be required to limit what it can charge patients for out-of-network services, which the state said would prevent people from facing surprise medical bills.

""If we're going to treat something that's precious and lifesaving like a business, then the marketplace for health care must be vibrant and competitive so that the best in the business can rise to the top naturally,"" Xavier Becerra, California's attorney general, said in a news conference Friday.

Economy,Major Employers Left Out of Government's Coronavirus Relief Plan,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/02/business/economy/major-employers-coronavirus-relief.html,"WASHINGTON -- One of the biggest questions surrounding the government's efforts to help businesses struggling amid the coronavirus pandemic is whether the programs are constructed in a way that will prevent a wave of bankruptcies, keeping a short-term shock from turning into drawn-out economic pain. A new analysis from a group of Harvard University researchers suggests that the answer, should markets turn ugly again, might be no. Highly indebted public companies that employ millions of people are largely left out of the major direct relief options that Congress, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury have devised to help companies make it through the pandemic. Much of that is by design. Policymakers have prioritized getting help to businesses that came into the coronavirus crisis in good health, lowering the chances that taxpayers will wind up bailing out big companies that loaded up on risky debt. It could also help officials avoid the kind of angry criticism that surrounded 2008 bank and auto company rescues.

But it leaves a slice of America's companies fending for themselves amid the sharpest downturn since the Great Depression, putting them at greater risk of bankruptcy and their workers at greater risk of job loss. Publicly traded firms that employ about 8.1 million people -- roughly 26 percent of all employment at tracked publicly traded companies -- are all or mostly excluded from direct government relief, based on an analysis by Samuel Hanson, Jeremy Stein and Adi Sunderam of Harvard, along with Eric Zwick of the University of Chicago. Not all of those companies are likely to run into trouble, some have deep-pocketed investors behind them and others made poor financial choices that left them vulnerable to shock. But excluding a broad swath of employers could affect how successful the government is at preventing wide-scale bankruptcies if virus-related economic pain lingers, the researchers warned. ""We're trying to flatten the bankruptcy curve, or flatten the financial distress curve,"" said Mr. Hanson, who refined the analysis for The New York Times. If a large number of companies are left out of support programs and go out of business, ""it's likely to be very costly and leave permanent scarring to our productive capacity."" Their analysis is only a starting point. Many private companies are also excluded, but information about those firms is harder to come by, so the authors do not account for them.

""This is almost like the tip of the iceberg,"" Mr. Hanson said. After the pandemic forced states to go into varying degrees of lockdown in March, tanking revenues and freezing the financial markets that companies tap to raise cash, the government announced a suite of programs to help corporations make it through. The Paycheck Protection Program for small businesses -- created and funded by Congress and operated by the Treasury and the Small Business Administration -- extends loans to companies employing up to 500 people, with some exceptions. The loans are forgivable as long as those businesses meet program criteria, which require them to hang onto workers. To help bigger companies, Congress turned to the Fed, which can set up emergency lending programs in times of economic trouble. Lawmakers gave Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin $454 billion to back up such efforts.

Some of the firms that those direct government programs miss -- think the Gap, Dell Technologies and Kraft Heinz -- are household names with huge work forces. If such companies were to run into problems gaining access to cash, it could precipitate job cuts, the researchers said. But there is a reason the business relief programs have avoided directly betting on more debt-laden big companies. Including shakier businesses in the Main Street facilities or the corporate bond program would increase the risk that companies would fail to pay the Fed and the Treasury back, ramping up the chances that the lending programs would lose money and -- ultimately -- cost taxpayers. Adding in risky companies could also expose the Fed and the Treasury to accusations that they bailed out companies that private equity firms had loaded with debt to maximize profits. And Democratic lawmakers have specifically warned against helping companies that were struggling heading into the crisis. The Fed should ""refrain"" from using the Main Street program ""to help companies paper over existing problems arising from excessive leverage, international price competition and concerns about long-term viability,"" Senator Sherrod Brown, the highest-ranking Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, wrote in a letter to the Fed chair, Jerome H. Powell, and Mr. Mnuchin on May 18. The Fed has helped risky companies less directly. One of its corporate bond programs will buy a limited amount of junk-bond exchange traded funds, which trade like stocks but track a broad basket of corporate debt. That, along with the mere signal that investment-grade bond purchases are coming, has breathed life back into choked bond markets, including for junk debt. But the fact that a group of companies has little to no access to direct assistance -- essentially leaving those firms at the mercy of market conditions -- could come at a cost if things worsen again, in which case borrowing is likely to become more difficult for high-yield companies that do not actually have Fed support to back them. ""You have to be a little careful about assuming you can just do things with magic,"" said Mr. Stein, the analysis co-author who is a former Fed governor. While markets might assume the central bank will step in to help the market, if they don't when push comes to shove, conditions could deteriorate sharply.

Groups focused on workers point out that the Fed lending programs lack toothy employment requirements, so it is possible that even if the central bank could find a way to support such companies, it would help shareholders without leading to worker retention. ""You don't want to pay off owners of zombie companies, or people who took big risks on oil and gas corporations and they didn't pan out,"" said Marcus Stanley, the policy director at Americans for Financial Reform.","Programs to help businesses weather the pandemic largely omit some indebted companies, Harvard economists found.",7ea837d2-fe91-5cff-b798-d5d54efd85bb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/01/business/00dc-leftout-01/merlin_172015764_2c3e9b7a-e06a-48bd-9def-ba35f7a1411a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d5d0aa2d250d895465ea115b5cf7ea7f1bc858dece320877654f32597f0eb6c9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A Gap store in San Francisco.

Books,The Cautionary Tale of Adam Neumann and WeWork,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/23/books/review/billion-dollar-loser-adam-neumann-wework-reeves-wiedeman.html,"The reigning conceit of the author's tragicomic play-by-play of Neumann's misadventures is that of a cult masquerading as a real business. Central to this theme is the sustained involvement of Neumann and his wife, Rebekah Paltrow (Gwyneth's cousin), in the Kabbalah Center. What exactly is taught there is elusive to nonmembers -- some sort of Jewish mysticism, allegedly, dating back to the 12th century but repackaged for affluent New Age consumers with yoga bodies and Instagram -- but it has attracted stars and luminaries since the '80s, including Madonna, its premier disciple. The center encouraged its devotees to wear lucky red strings around one wrist, which Neumann did for quite a while, until a more sober-minded business person warned him to lose the item or risk confirming his burgeoning reputation as a flake.

For readers, Neumann is a flake from Wiedeman's opening paragraph. Citing an interview from April 2019, not long before WeWork's unraveling, Wiedeman describes Neumann as engaged in a belated campaign to polish his image and raise one of many rounds of outside cash to replace the vast sums he'd already dissipated. ""He no longer had the punching bag, the gong or the bar that occupied his previous suite,"" Wiedeman writes, ""but this version had a private bathroom with a sauna and a cold-plunge tub."" The surrounding offices were comparably exotic: ""Beneath a kitchen canopy draped with hanging plants, several water coolers were stuffed with a rotating orchard of fruit ... and a dozen taps serving beer, cider, cold brew, seltzer, Merlot, Pinot Grigio and kombuchas, plural. A placard helpfully explained to the company's fresh-faced workforce, where 30-year-olds felt like senior citizens, that tilting your glass while dispensing a beer would lead to a smoother pour.""

The smoothest pour of all at WeWork was the frothy utopian verbiage continually streaming from Neumann's mouth. This river of bombast, initially intoxicating to investors and employees alike but ultimately stale and rank to all, included numbers representing tired old concepts such as earnings and expenditures. Its chief concern, however, was the wonderful futuristic world of We. What the letters ""Mc"" are to McDonald's, ""We"" was to Neumann. WeLive, for example, was the name he gave to an ostensibly world-altering initiative to extend his kingdom from commercial real estate to residential. Beginning with two buildings, he shrank apartments to dorm-room size and fluffed up the surplus square footage with social amenities. Game rooms. Party rooms. As Wiedeman dryly notes -- and his is a book that calls constantly for dryness, lest the reader drown in its absurdities -- Neumann's analysis of New York's tenant class had led him to conclude that what the city's renters coveted were smaller living quarters buffeted by louder noises. WeLive remained a two-building operation.

All of which presents a mystery: How on earth did Neumann and his WeThing attract an almost unprecedented level of private investment capital during his decade-long tenure as its head shaman? The answer is never stated explicitly, but lives in the margins and between the lines on almost every page: because the private equity community had Neumann-like magical thinkers of its own. Merlins recognize Merlins, and Wiedeman's finest feat of reporting and double portraiture is his evocation of Neumann's relationship with his financial savior (for a time) Masayoshi Son, the big-picture, long-term, positively cosmic founder of the Japanese tech conglomerate Softbank.

To delve any further into their relationship would be to give away the plot of ""Billion Dollar Loser,"" which, like the most engrossing nonfiction stories, has a plot indeed, one that only reality could contrive. To fully appreciate its twists and turns, the reader should understand, or be willing to study on the fly, the customs, manners and vocabulary of contemporary investment banking. The sure reward for this effort is utter horror, unless the reader is herself a banker, in which case profound embarrassment might be more appropriate. The global pool of capital on which free-market societies float like inflatable rubber ducks is a virtually bottomless reservoir of folly, vanity, mania and caprice. The accounting standards that purport to measure it and regulate its tidal flows are as fluid and foamy as WeWork's tap kombucha. What was Neumann's company worth in its grand heyday, when its employees numbered in the thousands, its holdings and offices spanned the globe, and a gong still hung in its leader's office? Ten billion dollars? Forty-five? Or was WeWork's value potentially -- as Son and Neumann both foresaw at one point, before a disastrous, aborted I.P.O. curbed the madness -- a nice round trillion? All of the above, and none. What can be reliably calculated, however, is the ransom paid to Neumann for turning over his ghost ship to new officers. A billion dollars.","In ""Billion Dollar Loser,"" Reeves Wiedeman places the once exalted Silicon Valley founder in the context of contemporary capitalism.",5f2d6120-c108-5e6e-8c93-7dae5d959ac6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/08/books/review/20Kirn/20Kirn-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4a33bf3bd0a2df25350f83316682e9a6b8883bd8d7dd8696b856e8c97eebc339&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Adam Neumann at the WeWork headquarters in New York in 2015.,5f2d6120-c108-5e6e-8c93-7dae5d959ac6,N24News/imgs/5f2d6120-c108-5e6e-8c93-7dae5d959ac6.jpg,13
Technology,"Vodafone, One of World's Largest Cell Carriers, Halts Buying of Huawei Gear",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/technology/vodafone-huawei.html,"LONDON -- The Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei was dealt another blow on Friday when one of the world's largest wireless carriers suspended its purchases from the company in Europe over security concerns about its ties to the Chinese government. Vodafone Group, which is based in London, said it would temporarily stop buying Huawei equipment for core parts of its next-generation wireless networks, known as 5G. Nick Read, Vodafone's chief executive officer, said the pause was necessary while European governments considered whether to ban the use of Huawei equipment. Mr. Read said Vodafone's decision reflected political factors rather than any newly discovered security vulnerabilities. Huawei has been dogged by a campaign led by United States officials, who have argued that Beijing could use the company's gear for spying. ""The noise level is at an unhealthy level across Europe,"" Mr. Read said during a conference call with reporters.

Europe has become a key battleground for Huawei, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications equipment. The region is the company's second-largest market after China, largely because of lucrative partnerships with carriers that, in addition to Vodafone, include BT Group, Deutsche Telekom and Telefonica. In contrast to its strained relationship with the United States, Huawei has also enjoyed strong ties to European governments, thanks in part to investments it has made throughout the region. The United States has pressured its European allies to increase their scrutiny of Huawei. The American authorities have cited moves by President Xi Jinping of China to take more control of the country's economy and the enactment of laws that could require network operators to defend Chinese national security interests. Last month, Canada detained a Huawei executive, Meng Wanzhou, a daughter of the company's founder, at the request of the United States on charges that she participated in a scheme to violate sanctions against Iran. Federal prosecutors in Seattle are also investigating Huawei over allegations of intellectual property theft. Suspicions about Huawei have led countries like Britain, France and Germany to re-evaluate their relationships with the company. A Huawei employee was arrested and charged with espionage in Poland this month. (The company fired the employee shortly after he was arrested.) Vodafone's announcement followed one last month by BT to remove Huawei gear from parts of its network. Deutsche Telekom has also said it is re-evaluating its relationship with suppliers to account for the growing security concerns.

Getting boxed out of the 5G market in Europe would be painful for Huawei. Wireless companies in the region plan to spend billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to 5G, a potential windfall for suppliers of equipment for the underlying infrastructure. Huawei said Vodafone's move affected only a small amount of equipment. ""Vodafone and Huawei are long-term strategic partners that have worked together since 2007,"" Huawei said in a statement. ""We are grateful to Vodafone for its support of Huawei, and we will endeavor to live up to the trust placed in us."" Vodafone said its decision would be limited to equipment at the core of its network that handles much of the sensitive data related to calls and internet traffic. The company will continue to rely on Huawei for ancillary gear like cellular antennas. Mr. Read called Huawei a ""strong partner"" and expressed frustration about the debate over the possible security threat it posed. ""I don't think everyone is being clear enough and being fact based,"" he said. He added that Vodafone would continue to use Huawei as it hadin other markets, including Africa. He also warned that if regulators imposed a broad ban on Huawei that affected antennas and other equipment, it would delay the introduction of the faster networks in Europe. Such a move, he said, ""would have significant financial costs, have significant customer disruption and would ultimately be delaying the 5G launch in many countries.""",The British company said it would no longer use the Chinese telecommunications giant's equipment in some parts of its network in Europe because of political factors.,464d3ebb-affa-5afc-805a-dae14e0fbfb4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/business/26hauwei/26hauwei-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=134d9b18757c253fe6ab322a343b838789bb284104f94b6a476250b8af9087ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Vodafone Group said it would temporarily stop buying Huawei equipment in Europe, the latest blow to the Chinese telecommunications giant.",464d3ebb-affa-5afc-805a-dae14e0fbfb4,N24News/imgs/464d3ebb-affa-5afc-805a-dae14e0fbfb4.jpg,20
Economy,Fed Debates Next Steps After Shifting Approach to Rate-Setting,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/business/economy/fed-september-meeting.html,"WASHINGTON -- Federal Reserve officials are contemplating their next steps after announcing a new approach to interest rate-setting last month, one that could lay the groundwork for longer periods of low unemployment and rock-bottom borrowing costs. But it may be too soon for Fed officials to make big changes to their policy-setting at their September meeting, which concludes on Wednesday, because they might need more time to coalesce around their next steps, economists said. The Fed slashed interest rates to near zero in March, and it is broadly expected to leave them there for years. Officials are now debating whether to concretely communicate their future plans for rates -- often called forward guidance -- by promising that they will not lift them until inflation, employment or both cross some preset threshold. They are also discussing when and how to update their bond-buying program. Since March, the central bank has been purchasing large amounts of Treasury and mortgage-backed securities to keep markets functioning smoothly, but officials have signaled that they will eventually shift that program to focus instead on stimulating economic growth.

Either change could add a little more oomph to the central bank's policies, potentially helping to fuel the recovery from the coronavirus-induced economic crisis. While some analysts expect changes imminently, most anticipate that the 17 Fed officials, 12 of whom vote on the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee, will take longer to make those major steps. The Fed will provide a post-meeting statement and update its economic projections on Wednesday. ""It feels like there's going to be a forward lean from them -- there's a refinement coming,"" said Julia Coronado, a former Fed economist and founder of MacroPolicy Perspectives. Still, she does not expect either threshold-based forward guidance or a big tweak to the bond-buying program just yet. ""This is a big and diverse committee, these are complicated issues, and it is uncharted territory."" The central bank's Summary of Economic Projections, a document in which officials anonymously forecast where interest rates, inflation and unemployment will be in coming years, will get a refresh at this meeting. The so-called S.E.P. will extend through 2023 for the first time. Economists said they expected the Fed to indicate that interest rates would remain on hold throughout that period, reinforcing its plans to be very patient in removing the cushion it is now providing the economy. Low interest rates spur growth by making credit cheaper -- encouraging homeowners to refinance, which frees up spending money, and inspiring businesses to invest. Fed officials will also almost certainly revise down their unemployment rate projections in the document, because the jobless rate declined from 14.7 percent in April to 8.4 percent in August, a faster drop than the central bank had expected. When the Fed released its last set of projections in June, officials expected unemployment to average 9.3 percent in the last three months of 2020.

Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, announced in August that the central bank was shifting its monetary policy approach, and no longer planned to lift interest rates simply because the unemployment rate had dropped below levels it saw as sustainable. Officials will also adopt an average inflation target, aiming for 2 percent over time rather than as an absolute goal -- implying that they will sometimes allow price increases to run slightly faster. The point is to keep inflation from dropping ever lower, which would leave the central bank less room to aid the economy in the future by cutting rates, which include price gains. Despite that shift, few economists expected officials to pencil in an inflation rate above 2 percent in 2023, in part because the outlook for price increases is tepid. ""We also expect that most participants will be reluctant to show conditions that could be interpreted as consistent with liftoff, even at a 2023 horizon,"" David Mericle at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note previewing the meeting. The Fed releases a statement explaining its policies after its meetings, and that document will probably be updated to reflect the new approach. It could change the language that promises to strive for a ""symmetric"" 2 percent inflation target -- meaning one that is equally unsatisfied if inflation runs above or below the target -- to phrasing that pledges to aim for 2 percent over time. The statement might also upgrade its description of the economy, which has performed better than expected as virus cases moderate somewhat, joblessness declines and consumer spending measures more or less hold up, despite the lapse in a $600 weekly unemployment insurance supplement that ended in late July.

Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan Chase, predicted in a note that the Fed would ""take note of the pickup in economic activity and employment without celebrating it."" It is unclear whether the Fed will provide guidance on the future path of interest rates at this meeting. Officials are considering whether they should tie their next steps on interest rates to unemployment and inflation thresholds, which the central bank did after the 2008 financial crisis. Covid's impact on the supply chain continues. The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain and made all kinds of products harder to find. In turn, scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher as inflation remains stubbornly high. Almost anything manufactured is in short supply. That includes everything from toilet paper to new cars. The disruptions go back to the beginning of the pandemic, when factories in Asia and Europe were forced to shut down and shipping companies cut their schedules. First, demand for home goods spiked. Money that Americans once spent on experiences were redirected to things for their homes. The surge clogged the system for transporting goods to the factories that needed them and finished products piled up because of a shortage of shipping containers. Now, ports are struggling to keep up. In North America and Europe, where containers are arriving, the heavy influx of ships is overwhelming ports. With warehouses full, containers are piling up. The chaos in global shipping is likely to persist as a result of the massive traffic jam. No one really knows when the crisis will end. Shortages and delays are likely to affect this year's Christmas and holiday shopping season, but what happens after that is unclear. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said he expects supply chain problems to persist ""likely well into next year."" Some regional Fed presidents have indicated that they would favor waiting and making such changes once they had more information about the economy, especially because investors already thoroughly understand that rates will be low for a long time. ""I don't feel like there's a burning pressure that we need to change our forward guidance today to change market expectations,"" Neel Kashkari, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said on a Bloomberg podcast in late August. That sentiment has been echoed by several of his colleagues, including the Atlanta Fed's Raphael Bostic and the Boston Fed's Eric Rosengren. Fed officials might also prefer to wait for more information before they provide an update to their plans for bond buying. The Fed is planning to eventually shift its asset purchases to more explicitly focus them on stimulating the economy, which could include buying bonds with longer time frames. But some economists did think that the central bank could make major moves at this meeting, if only to back up its recent strategy shift. Seth Carpenter, a former Fed economist now at the bank UBS, said he expected the central bank to tie its interest rate outlook to its forecast for inflation. He thinks the Fed needs to do something to follow through on the unveiling of its strategy shift.

""They really are in a bind,"" Mr. Carpenter said. ""Not doing anything, and not having hit your goals in the past, seems like a recipe for having your goals disbelieved."" In any case, Mr. Powell will answer questions from the news media after the meeting at 2:30 p.m. on Wednesday. He could echo his colleagues -- and repeat his own occasional admonition -- in urging Congress and the White House to continue supporting the economy. Key supports for the economy, including the $600-a-week expansion to unemployment insurance, expired in late July. While President Trump has enacted partial stopgap measures, those will run out, and they do not provide the holistic help that a congressional package might. And talks over legislation have stalled for more than a month, with deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats. ""Partisan politics threatens to endanger additional fiscal relief,"" Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said in a speech this month. ""A lack of action or an inadequate one presents a very significant downside risk to the economy today.""","The Federal Reserve, which unveiled a new strategy last month that will leave interest rates low for longer, could provide hints on Wednesday about how it will reinforce its commitment.",f0ff614b-05ba-5ff1-a9be-e1f1b1311128,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/16/business/16dc-fedpreview-02/merlin_171561357_54977f20-f31d-41fc-b39b-2fb163861aec-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9be58f563d1861afc3375b20a6462c3a7b921381b74227a9bb8e702779bab8fb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Federal Reserve slashed interest rates to near zero in March, and it is broadly expected to leave them there for years.",f0ff614b-05ba-5ff1-a9be-e1f1b1311128,N24News/imgs/f0ff614b-05ba-5ff1-a9be-e1f1b1311128.jpg,8
Theater,"Glenda Jackson on Quitting Parliament, Playing Lear and Returning to Broadway",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/20/theater/glenda-jackson-three-tall-woman.html,"Glenda Jackson, taking a break from rehearsals for ""Three Tall Women,"" which will mark her return to Broadway after 30 years.Credit...Annie Tritt for The New York Times



LONDON -- ""No,"" said Glenda Jackson, the great British actress and former member of Parliament, her voice like a tolling bronze bell. ""Oh no. No."" When Ms. Jackson -- who is returning to Broadway for the first time in three decades, in a starry new production of Edward Albee's ""Three Tall Women"" -- says ""no,"" it often has a conclusive tone that effectively shuts the door on a subject. Three ""no's"" suggests that the door has been triple locked. In this instance, the topic was pretty much guaranteed to elicit denial, diversion or evasion from Ms. Jackson, who spent 23 uninterrupted years away from the stage and screen while working in government. That would be the embarrassing fact (or, as she would have it, nonexistence) of her celebrity. It was a January morning at the cafe of the National Gallery, and I had made the mistake of asserting that Ms. Jackson was one of the reigning movie goddesses of the early 1970s, given her status as a two-time Oscar winner for Best Actress and, more surprisingly, something of a box-office draw.

Ms. Jackson -- with a helmet of cropped coppery hair, no visible makeup and a black and white dress from Marks & Spencer -- roared right back at her audience. ""Oh, c'mon,"" she said, in the manner of a popular but stern school head on games day. ""We don't do standing ovations in England."" For once, though, a standing ovation seemed warranted. Though Ms. Jackson holds a special place in the hearts of film and theater cognoscenti, she hadn't exercised her acting muscles -- or even attended the theater -- during her years in Parliament. Yet critics had waxed ecstatic over her portrait of a despot suddenly betrayed by age -- a man, as Ms. Jackson described him, to whom ""no one had said 'no' in his entire life."" ""She appeared naked in a sense from her first entrance,"" said Matthew Warchus, the Old Vic's artistic director, who had facilitated Ms. Jackson's return to her former profession. ""We hadn't seen her in so long, so it was an incredible thing to hear her voice again. That's a neat trick, to make your first entrance after 20 years of silence."" In person, Ms. Jackson is formidable but hardly as forbidding as her reputation would have it. She answers questions with a conscientious courtesy, only slightly underscored by impatience. Her face remains the face she was born with, scored with the lines you would expect a lifelong smoker to accumulate but untouched by the mask-like distortions of plastic surgery. On the morning I met her in London, she arrived at the cafe, straight from ""bloody public transport,"" in a sharp and purposeful blur, like a blade flung by a circus thrower seeking its target. She was again sans makeup and wearing drop pearl earrings (a gift from her son) and a wardrobe -- red coat, black pants, buffalo check flannel shirt, running shoes -- largely acquired from her trusty Marks & Spencer. (""A good thing about Marks & Spencer, they don't hound you when you're going round."") She was conscious of the time, since she was on ""grandson patrol"" that day and would be needing to pick up her son's 11-year-old from school. At a certain point, she realized it might be a good idea if she had something to eat. We both ordered the soup, which came with bread. ""How big is the bread?"" she asked the server. ""It's half a loaf isn't it? One of those should do. One to share. Save money and save food. Two-thirds of the world go to bed hungry every night, and we stuff ourselves.""

Ms. Jackson did not check her cellphone. She doesn't have one. ""No, I have no piece of information technology equipment at all,"" she said, and she is thankful to have no access to social media. But as a star of long standing, surely she must have to deal with certain incursions into her privacy. Does she read what is written about her? ""Well, no, because nobody writes about me,"" she says. ""There's nothing to write about. I lead a very dull, ordinary life which is the kind of life that I wish to lead."" As for what she does when she's not working, ""Well, you have to keep your place clean, you have to pay your bills, you have to do the shopping."" Such comments seem a matter less of false modesty than of existential necessity, and jibe with her definition of herself: ""I'm a pretty antisocial Socialist."" Glenda Jackson was born in 1936 in the Cheshire region of Northern England, the daughter of working-class parents. (Her father was a bricklayer; her mother cleaned houses and worked in shops.) Being the oldest of four girls, she has said, instilled in her ""an overdeveloped sense of responsibility."" She started appearing in amateur theater productions in the area when she was working behind the counter in a Boots pharmacy. ""Someone said to me that you should do this professionally,"" she recalls matter-of-factly. ""So I wrote to the only drama school I had ever heard of."" It was a big one, the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London; she was accepted, with scholarships. When she began to audition professionally, she was told she could expect only character parts. She found work, usually in supporting roles, in repertory companies, which was how she met Roy Hodges, a fellow actor and stage manager, to whom she was married from 1958 to 1976. (Their son, Dan, would grow up to become a political columnist; Ms. Jackson now lives in the basement flat of the house he shares with his wife and son.)

She became a bankable star, who worked in both offbeat masterpieces (""Sunday Bloody Sunday"") and bloated costume duds (""The Incredible Sarah,"" as Sarah Bernhardt). She appeared on stage, in London and New York in productions that included a ""Macbeth"" (1988), opposite Christopher Plummer, with which she made her last previous appearance on Broadway. It was not a success. ""There were great difficulties over the kind of production it was going to be,"" Ms. Jackson remembered. ""Very ruthless, Broadway. People do devour people. I think we had about three or four directors."" Ms. Jackson perceived a different kind of ruthlessness at work in her native Britain, then under the leadership of Margaret Thatcher. ""What she'd done to my country, I didn't believe it,"" she said. She recalled reading a Thatcher quote that said ""there's no such thing as a society,"" and ""I was so incensed by that, I walked into my closed French windows and almost broke my nose."" She had been asked before if she'd be willing to stand for a Labor Party seat. And then ""suddenly out of the blue Hampstead and Highgate came up. And I thought, 'Oh, go for it, just do it.'"" When she won, she didn't think twice about saying goodbye to acting. ""There's no way you could do both,"" she said.

Overtures about acting again had been made to her while she was still in Parliament, from, among others, Mr. Warchus and the ""Three Tall Women"" producer Scott Rudin (who as a theater-crazy kid had seen her on Broadway in ""Marat/Sade"" and wanted her for the part Judi Dench played in the film ""Notes on a Scandal""). But it was only after she stepped down from her Parliament seat in 2015 that acting once again seemed like a possibility. Mr. Warchus recalled his first meeting with her about ""Lear"": ""I met her at the stage door and she was smoking, and she seemed to be in some sort of irascible state."" After they talked in his office, he took her onto to the Old Vic stage. ""And I could see her sort of unfurl,'' he said. ""We stood there looking out, and her eyes became a bit watery and she was reminiscing about the different shows that she'd done. It may seem an obvious and sentimental thing to say, but it was a homecoming for her. I had seen the great rigorousness; then I also got to see the emotion."" When I repeated Mr. Warchus's recollection of that ""homecoming"" moment to Ms. Jackson, she almost snorted. ""Oh no,"" she said. ""No, no. Oh no. It was a theater I worked in more than once. And they'd maintained it beautifully."" As you might suspect, Ms. Jackson's approach to acting appears to be unclouded by mysticism or sentimentality. She sees performing as a collaborative effort, above all. (""I was taught to leave my ego outside the stage door,"" she said to me several times.) In discussing ""Lear,"" she kept insisting that the play is not only about its title monarch. ""There's not a bad part in it.""

In the meantime, she was thinking with horror about packing for the trip to New York, a place she hadn't visited in so long she couldn't recall the last time she was there. ""I hate traveling,"" she said, sounding almost nervous, for once. ""I hate luggage."" The next time I saw Ms. Jackson was in a Broadway rehearsal room on West 42nd Street, where she was embodying the frail but fierce old woman identified simply as A in Albee's script, under the soft-spoken direction of Joe Mantello. Her co-stars, Ms. Metcalf and Ms. Pill, were on hand as B and C, women of different generations tending to the demanding A in the play's first scene. It was kind of distressing to see Ms. Jackson looking and sounding so feeble, and a relief when she became her trenchant self again during breaks. She interrupted the proceedings to suggest that the tone of the scene should alter more palpably after A says something particularly arrogant to Ms. Pill's character. (""I mean, it's so rude, isn't it? I don't care how old you are. There's no excuse for it."") And then without a beat, she became Albee's insufferably rude woman once again. Ms. Pill said she had expected to be intimidated by Ms. Jackson, and she was right, though there's ""not an element of diva in the slightest."" The intimidation factor, she said, comes from her being ""potentially the smartest person in the room."" Later that day, in a lounge at the hotel where she is staying, Ms. Jackson's voice was softer than during our first encounter, and she spoke more slowly. I had the impression of someone carefully husbanding her energy. She was pleased, she said, to be working with other actresses, for a change. ""It has been, really, everything one could hope for. Because, as I've said, most plays have only one decent woman's part in them, and if you've got it, there aren't any other actresses to work with."" She said she still hadn't entirely found her way into her role in ""Three Tall Women,"" and astutely elaborated on some questions of character she was trying to resolve. (Was C's fear of theft motivated by experience or paranoia?)

And what about other roles to come, perhaps in film? ""Oh, I think that's highly unlikely. I mean, I think parts for women of my years are well and truly finished."" And theater? ""That depends. Again, where are the contemporary playwrights?"" Mr. Warchus, however, said that in watching her performing Lear, ""not for a second did you think that this is someone's swan song. It was the opposite. And she said to me, 'What's next Matthew? Find me another play.'"" In her 30s, Ms. Jackson had said she was looking forward to old age, because it ""seems the only irresponsible time of your life."" When she decided she would not stand for Parliament again three years ago, she said she thought, ""'Oh, I'm going to be so irresponsible. There'll be nothing to be responsible for."" The reality was, perhaps inevitably, quite the opposite. ""In truth, you are even more responsible,"" she said, not sounding remotely regretful. ""What gets you out of bed in the morning, if not you?"" For the moment, Ms. Jackson's sense of responsibility is trained almost entirely on her current role. Her nights are spent with the script, she said, and it is all she has been reading. And though she loves to walk in New York, she had been outside only rarely since she arrived, because it had been cold, which had forced her to cut down on smoking. (""I'm well below 10 a day. I don't know how good or bad that is."") Did she find she was recognized on the streets? ""No, I'm not recognized in London. What would people recognize?"" Well, she is inimitably herself, I said. Her response: ""Oh no, come on, good God. No.""","After winning two Oscars, she stopped acting for decades to fight Thatcherism. Now, at 81, she's tackling an Edward Albee classic.

But these days, she is also wearing other hats, including running a makeup line called Flower and a namesake wine label with Carmel Road. And now she is again trying something new, playing a zombie in the Netflix dark comedy ""Santa Clarita Diet,"" out on Friday. When she isn't dining on human flesh onscreen, she is probably seeking out the latest beauty find in real life. From her annual ""barnacle removal"" to her hair color O.C.D., Ms. Barrymore dishes all.

I'm a compulsive face washer. For me, it's three times a day, morning, noon and night. I like my cleansers baby mild. If I'm on the run, I grab a Cetaphil. Or I use one by Christine Chin. Then I have to have a toner, no matter what. Otherwise, I just break out. I have the Clinique acne clearing gel, or again, I use Christine Chin. I would use Sea Breeze. It doesn't matter. I just have to tone.

As you get older, you get melasma; you have kids; there's sun damage. I like to pad my moisturizer with a Christine Chin brightening serum. I'm obsessed with her line. It's the only thing I splurge on. I don't have time to go for facials, so I haven't seen her in years, but every couple of months, I'm buying the goods.

Then I definitely moisturize. The biggest game changer is, no question, Korean beauty. You get all this amazing moisturizing without the oil. I've used really expensive products and really inexpensive products, and most moisturizers break me out. The Korean masks have changed my life. The one I love the most is JayJun Baby Pure Shining Mask.

Fashion & Style,What Does Modest Fashion Mean?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/fashion/what-does-modest-fashion-mean.html,"A Muslim, an Orthodox Jew and a religious Christian walked into a room, but it wasn't a bar and this was no joke. On the contrary, representatives from each of the Abrahamic religions had gathered during fashion month at New York University for the Meeting Through Modesty fashion symposium to discuss something they take very seriously: modest style. A generous smattering of hijabs, skullcaps and discreet wigs were spread throughout the room, along with Proenza Schouler skirts and Rachel Comey shoes. ""There's a general misconception that modest clothing is inherently oppressive,"" said Michelle Honig, the keynote speaker and an Orthodox Jewish fashion journalist. ""But if women in so-called 'liberated countries' still choose to cover their bodies, then they have made a choice. They have agency."" Ms. Honig had layered a Tanya Taylor top and Marc by Marc Jacobs skirt under a striped Prada dress to keep her elbows and knees concealed, in addition to wearing a wig to keep her head covered, per Orthodox custom.

Interpretations of modesty differ across religious boundaries and even within them. ""Modesty"" in a Muslim context may be expressed by wearing loosefitting pants and covering one's head with a hijab, while an Orthodox Jewish woman may wear skirts or dresses only and cover her head with a wig. Christian women, like the swimwear designer Jessica Rey, may express their vision of modesty by eschewing bikinis in favor of bathing suits that expose their legs but cover their midriffs. Still, the shared interest in staying relatively covered up while still looking stylish is enough to connect women across religious, racial and cultural boundaries. Many of them cite devotion to God and a desire to present themselves as ""more than a collection of body parts,"" in Ms. Rey's words, as the motivation behind their affinity for modest dress.

""Making connections with other Christians, as well as Muslim and Jewish women, has probably been the most exciting benefit of blogging,"" says Liz Roy, a Christian who runs the personal style blog Downtown Demure. ""We all have different standards for modesty, but we share this common goal, which can be a bit contradictory to secular standards."" These connections have the potential to yield more than just warm, fuzzy feelings, according to the Jewish Orthodox sisters Simi and Chaya Gestetner of the modest indie label the Frock. While they enjoy the personal connections they build with customers of any faith (including their Orthodox neighbors in Brooklyn and their Mormon fans in Salt Lake City), they also see the mobilization of the modest-fashion community as a real boon for business. The sisters report seeing a significant increase in sales every time the Jewish Orthodox street style star Adi Heyman posts Instagram images of herself wearing their pieces, often mixed with separates from brands like Gucci or Chanel. Since Ms. Heyman's blog, Fabologie, flows from her desire to find more modest options in mainstream fashion, the continued success of brands like the Frock is something she is deeply invested in. And while linking commerce and religion may seem distasteful to some, modest-fashion entrepreneurs like Melanie Elturk see it as a natural way to live out their faith and serve their communities. Ms. Elturk, a former lawyer who founded the online retailer Haute Hijab in 2010, uses her online following to offer style inspiration and practical resources to young Muslim women who are seeking to honor the tradition of wearing hijabs in the face of cultural pushback. ""I have a whole network of psychiatrists, therapists, social workers and community leaders who I put in touch with girls who are struggling so they can hash out any issues,"" said Ms. Elturk, whose responsive social media presence engages many younger followers. ""I want to see a thriving community of girls who are proud to wear hijab.""

Like many of her peers across religious lines, she would argue that modesty is required of both men and women, and that it's as much about how one carries oneself as how one dresses. And like Ms. Rey, whose line is made in America, Ms. Elturk would assert that her religious beliefs have made her as committed to ethical production as she is to modesty in fashion. But perhaps the greatest point of consensus about modest fashion across a range of faiths is that it need not be experienced as a limiting factor in style or in life. At the N.Y.U. panel, the Indonesian designer Dian Pelangi showed a video by Hijup, a Muslim fashion store, that showcased herself, a member of a hard-core band known for social critique and a martial artist who all pursue their passions while wearing the hijab. Ms. Honig chimed in with anecdotes about her experiences sky diving, rock-climbing and rappelling while wearing a skirt, asserting that while it may not be easy to participate in certain activities while honoring strict modesty dictates, ""it's possible.""

Style,A Trendy Way to Protect Your Hair From Heat Damage,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/27/style/summer-hair-braids.html,"Nneka Ibeabuchi, a creative director and hair stylist originally from Nigeria, came up with the concept on her Instagram page for the ""Beads and Braids"" photo project when she took a trip to Ghana in December. ""I fell in love with Ghana's culture and wanted to come back and tell everybody how my trip was,"" she said. Adding beads to braids has origins in West Africa, where beads are used to accessorize bracelets, necklaces and anklets. ""As soon as I saw them on a woman's hair, I wanted them on my hair also,"" Ms. Ibeabuchi said. Here, in eight steps, Ms. Ibeabuchi demonstrates how to achieve a hairstyle that can help protect hair in the hot summer months. It's especially effective for women with thick or curly hair.

Step 2: Section off a small chunk of hair above your ear. Braid that chunk so that it hangs downward. (You will add beads the braid.) You can work with your natural hair, but Ms. Ibeabuchi recommends adding extensions. ""The extensions protect the natural hair and make it look neater,"" she said. She recommends Marley Kanekalon hair weaves. A beauty supply store can match its extensions to your hair texture.

Step 4: Create an inch-wide section in the middle of your head. Start the braid at the front of your forehead and braid close to your scalp, working toward the back. For a more natural look, Ms. Ibeabuchi recommends not adding any weave or extension to this piece. ""Every time I add extensions to it, it looks really bulky at the top,"" she said.

Step 5: Separate the remaining unbraided hair on the sides of your head into three vertical half-inch sections. Braid the first section downward to create a zigzag pattern. Once you finish that braid, use the hair on the end of the braid to start a braid in the opposite direction. Continue to braid in an up and down pattern. That will create the zigzag look. ""You would think we spent a whole lot of money on the hairstyle when we are done, but it's really cheap,"" Ms. Ibeabuchi said. She spent $9.99 on the weave extensions.

Step 6: Pull the hair in the back into a ponytail. Ms. Ibeabuchi adds Marley hair weave extensions to achieve a voluminous bun. ""It blends in with the hair texture,"" she said. She recommends using Eco Styler olive oil gel on the back of your head to hold the hair in place.

Step 7: The most important part of the look: the beads. Using the beads she found in Ghana, Ms. Ibeabuchi twists the bottom of the braids hanging over the ears and adds three beads. She repeats the step on the opposite side.

Step 8: To keep the beads in place, tie a small knot at the ends of the braids. Ms. Ibeabuchi also recommends burning the tips of the braids to give the hair a neat look. Bonus tip: To keep the scalp moisturized, she recommends using coconut oil or olive oil three times a week. For the hair itself, she likes Cantu leave-in conditioner to retain moisture.

Health,Pfizer C.E.O. All but Rules Out Vaccine Before Election Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/pfizer-covid-19-vaccine.html,"""Let's be very patient -- I know how much the stress levels are growing,"" Dr. Bourla said. ""I know how much the vaccine is needed for the world."" He also pushed back against any suggestion that politics were motivating the speed of development, saying ""this is not a Republican vaccine, or a Democrat vaccine.""

Pfizer's clinical trial is testing the vaccine in 44,000 people, half of whom will get a placebo. The trial's protocol, or blueprint, allows for an initial look at results after at least 32 people in either the placebo or vaccinated group have developed Covid-19. If more than 26 of those people are in the placebo group, then the vaccine is considered likely to be effective.

Dr. Bourla had repeatedly predicted that the initial analysis -- which is conducted by an outside board of scientific experts -- would come by the end of October. But on Tuesday, he said those 32 cases of Covid-19 had not yet occurred, a sign that the trial is progressing more slowly than the company had estimated. He also said the outside panel would need at least a week to analyze any results, making an answer before the election unlikely. Dr. Bourla said the company would report results if the outside board found the vaccine was either effective or not, but not if there is no definitive conclusion either way.

Even if early results come over the next few weeks, most Americans are not likely to get the vaccine anytime soon. Under guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration, coronavirus vaccine developers must turn in at least two months of safety data after half of the trial's participants have received the second dose of the vaccine, which Pfizer has said will not happen until at least the third week of November.","Pfizer's C.E.O. said on Tuesday that much-anticipated results from its vaccine trial would not be coming this month, after all.",e63c7c4e-df9e-541b-8388-c249e4919a84,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/27/science/27VIRUS-PFIZER/27VIRUS-PFIZER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=dd87a0fd879689c89fe15bd7ead89ff7876289bdd9d72bfe3ab3871e70ea2ef2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Pfizer's chief executive, Dr. Albert Bourla, appearing before a Senate committee last year.",e63c7c4e-df9e-541b-8388-c249e4919a84,N24News/imgs/e63c7c4e-df9e-541b-8388-c249e4919a84.jpg,1
Opinion,Russia Is at It Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/opinion/russia-burisma-trump.html,"This article is part of David Leonhardt's newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday.

If the recent hacking of a Ukrainian gas company was done by the Russian military -- as the initial evidence suggests -- President Trump deserves some responsibility.

The connection between Trump and the hacking would not be direct; there is no evidence that Trump or any of his aides were aware of the specific hack. But he has repeatedly encouraged foreign countries to interfere in American elections against his opponents -- which appears to be what happened in this case. No one should be surprised that those countries are doing exactly what Trump has encouraged.

It's a complicated story, so I want to take it one step at a time:

1. The Times reported this week that Russian military hackers appear to have been targeting Burisma, the Ukrainian gas company on whose board Hunter Biden -- Joe Biden's son -- served. As The Times story explained: ""Experts say the timing and scale of the attacks suggest that the Russians could be searching for potentially embarrassing material on the Bidens -- the same kind of information that Mr. Trump wanted from Ukraine when he pressed for an investigation of the Bidens and Burisma, setting off a chain of events that led to his impeachment.""",And Trump deserves some responsibility.,0f023974-fba4-527c-a9f2-9115cac6e0df,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/opinion/15leonhardt-newsletter/15leonhardt-newsletter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9ca3340cfb0e8c221c2a1ca425eb04ad78f0cdf1fa228187a8c733b145390e64&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Vladimir V.

Style,The Suburbs Are Kicking the Animals Out. Enter the Animal Rescue Squad.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/30/style/suburbs-animals.html,"ATLANTA -- In a small suburban park on a muggy morning a few months ago, a woman in elbow-length gloves was armed with a net, a loaf of bread and a tall cardboard box, all in hopes of catching an elusive goose. The goose, whose left leg was tightly wound in fishing line, walked with a pronounced hobble; as it swam, the leg dragged listlessly in the water. Yet in spite of its condition, animal instinct prevailed. The goose simply refused to be caught. Cindy Rooker, the would-be captor, hoped to retrieve the recalcitrant Canada goose, tuck it into the cardboard box she had brought, and drive it to a wildlife rehabilitation center a few hours away in South Carolina, where the bird would receive medical attention. But after several attempts, Ms. Rooker knew it was time to call it a day. Birds are easily stressed, and waterfowl have an inconvenient and frustrating knack for flying right into the center of a pond. Also, she didn't bring a kayak this time.

A police officer who lives in Canton, Ga., Ms. Rooker, 56, volunteers for the Wildlife Resources and Education Network (WREN). She started working with the organization at the beginning of the summer, and has since completed about 10 transports, crisscrossing the northern half of the state with the likes of orphaned baby opossums and injured hawks in the cab of her Nissan pickup truck. WREN connects people like Ms. Rooker -- committed animal lovers in the Southeast with spare time, spare gas money and an empty back seat -- with wildlife rehabbers and veterinary clinics that lack the resources to transport an animal on their own.

In other words, Ms. Rooker and her fellow transporters are Mother Nature's unpaid Uber drivers. Robert Jones, an animal lover whose other pursuits include military history and small-business consulting, started WREN with Liz Crandall in 2016. The two met at the Southeastern Raptor Center at Auburn University, where Ms. Crandall worked and Mr. Jones volunteered and, later, interned. They formed WREN as a wildlife educational initiative, but with time, sharpened their focus largely on transportation after seeing the same challenge day after day: More people seemed to be stumbling upon injured wildlife every passing year, but few wanted to transport the animals to rehabbers themselves.

""It's a really large gap,"" said Mr. Jones, 34, who now lives in Jonesborough, Tenn., and is the executive director of the Tilted Tavern Animal Sanctuary. Nonprofits like the raptor center don't always have the resources or staff to send someone out to fetch an animal, especially one that's hours away. That's where WREN -- and a handful of similar organizations, like the Connecticut Emergency Animal Response Service (EARS) -- step in. When I first spoke with Ms. Crandall, 46, by phone, she had just finished up ""a fawn call"" (which, at least in this instance, is not a pun). Ms. Crandall, who is the assistant director of the Tilted Tavern Animal Sanctuary, said that she fields roughly a dozen calls a day and manages a handful of transports each week, often across state lines. That number is increasing each year, for reasons both dismal and hopeful: while humans are pushing into wildlife territory more and more, some of them are also becoming more aware of, and attuned to, the wildlife in their backyards. ""I think people are more conscientious,"" Ms. Crandall said. ""They want to help more."" WREN uses Slack to communicate to its volunteers and manage logistics, like making sure each transporter has an appropriate container for the animal (typically a cardboard box or a lidded Rubbermaid bin with holes for oxygen). Driving a captured animal requires total silence in the car -- no phone conversations, no podcasts or music -- sometimes for hours on end.

One of the organizations WREN works with is the Chattahoochee Nature Center, where Kathryn Dudeck works as wildlife director. Ms. Dudeck said that the center fields 400 to 500 phone calls a month, and takes in over 650 animals for rehab each year. Those cases range from natural causes, like nestlings blown out of their nests in a hurricane, to injury explicitly at the hands of humans: an owl with buckshot in its wings, a red-tailed hawk hit by a car. ""Needless to say, Mother Nature didn't invent the vehicle or the gun,"" Ms. Dudeck said. ""So, we have a moral obligation to assist."" David Crawford is the founder of Animal Help Now, a 911-like website and smartphone app that links people to wildlife rehabbers and transporters like WREN. App usage has increased every year since its inception in 2012, he said. ""As we expand and build new roads and build new suburbs, you have a lot more interaction with animals,"" he said. Then, he added, there is climate change: more destructive hurricanes will yield more injuries and habitat destruction; prolonged droughts, raging forest fires and searing heat waves will continue to push desperate animals further into human habitats.

""People are going to be interacting with wildlife a lot more than they are right now,"" said Mr. Crawford. He estimates that by the end of 2019, Animal Help Now will have been used in 40,000 wildlife emergencies across the country. A week after the first attempt, Ms. Rooker was back at Laurel Park. This time, there was a scrum of additional helpers, including Ms. Crandall, along with two kayaks. There were, however, no geese. Just before the group split off to search nearby ponds for the flock, Darcell Patterson, a sneaker-shod woman, intercepted the volunteers. Ms. Patterson, 66, has walked around the park every day for the last four years, she said, and brings dried food pellets with her to ""establish rapport"" with the resident ducks and geese. She matter-of-factly informed the group that the injured goose is named Gary, and that his leg has been wrapped in that line for a couple of years. Gary, it seems, can survive on his own, and has not yet been ostracized from his avian comrades. Ms. Crandall decided to let Gary be for now, knowing he was under Ms. Patterson's watchful eye. As long as the bird can still fly, walk and eat, Ms. Crandall explained, the stress of relocation isn't justifiable yet. ""Gary's got friends in high places,"" Ms. Patterson said. While it wasn't the Disney-worthy victory that the volunteers may have had in mind this go-round, it was still a victory by their standards.",Suburban encroachment means tough times for wild critters.

Global Business,Patron of Siena Stumbles,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/business/global/the-patron-of-siena-monte-dei-paschi-stumbles.html,"The headquarters of Monte dei Paschi in Siena, Italy. At 541 years old, it is the world's oldest operating bank.

SIENA, Italy -- Cut into the stonework of the imposing Palazzo Salimbeni is a name that has been entwined with the fortunes of this Tuscan city for five centuries: Monte dei Paschi, or Mount of the Pastures. Since the days of the Medici family in Florence, 40 miles to the north, the banking house of Monte dei Paschi has rained wealth on the people of Siena. For 541 years, it has endured war, plague and panic, and it stands today as the world's oldest operating bank. But beyond the arched entrance of the Salimbeni palace, inside the stately offices of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, a thoroughly modern fiasco has done what the centuries could not. Monte dei Paschi, founded in 1472, has been brought to its knees by 21st-century finance. To howls across Italy, the government hastily arranged a bailout worth $5.1 billion. Now, the widening troubles, which began at a time of growing economic distress in Italy, have boiled over into an issue in nationwide elections to be held on Sunday and Monday.

Nowhere is the shock greater than in Siena. For many here, Monte dei Paschi is more than a bank. It is ""Babbo Monte,"" or Daddy Monte, the city's largest employer and greatest patron. For as long as anyone can remember, its money has helped pay for charities and civic works, including Siena's signature annual event, the colorful Palio horse races around the Piazza del Campo each summer. Indeed, the bank's largest shareholder, the charitable Monte dei Paschi Foundation, has long operated as a sort of shadow government here. Now, everyone wonders what will happen without Babbo Monte's money. ""Nothing falls from the sky anymore,"" said Mario Marzucchi, president of Misericordia di Siena, which provides health care to the city's poor and operates a fleet of ambulances. The charity is struggling to maintain its services and to renovate its clinic, located in a former Benedictine monastery. Caterina Barbetti, president of a cooperative that operates nursery schools, said she had been forced to reduce free child care for the city's poor. She used to depend on Babbo Monte, too. ""Now,"" she said, ""he has left."" Monte dei Paschi has occupied its palace in Siena's old town since the bank was founded, although it has added modern trappings like bulletproof glass doors. The bank's archives are in a vaulted room once used to store weapons. In the piazza out front stands a statue of Sallustio Bandini, an 18th-century Tuscan economist who was an early advocate of free trade. Where Monte dei Paschi goes from here will be determined largely by its chairman, Alessandro Profumo, a prominent banking executive brought in from Milan. Mr. Profumo, 56, is no stranger to controversy. In 2010, he was ousted as chief executive of another Italian bank, UniCredit, after the Libyan government acquired a large stake in that bank.

""Clearly, many investment banks made a lot of money on Monte dei Paschi,"" he said. ""I would say too much money."" The picturesque setting aside, the outlines of what went wrong here are all too familiar. In Siena, as in much of Europe, banks controlled by politicians provided loans and jobs in return for votes, and sponsored charities and civic organizations to buy good will. Vincenzo Loi, chief financial officer of A.C. Siena, the city's soccer team and another longtime beneficiary of Monte dei Paschi's largess, likened the system to the way the Roman emperors kept their citizens happy with bread and circuses.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. Monte dei Paschi's troubles have been exploited by both the right and the left in Italian politics. At a meeting of the bank's shareholders in January, Beppe Grillo, a comedian turned populist political leader, delivered a tirade about Monte dei Paschi's longtime connections to the Democratic Party, which for decades was the dominant political force in the city. The bank's real problems began in 2008, when it acquired Antonveneta, a small regional bank, from Santander of Spain. Analysts regarded the price of 9 billion euros ($11.9 billion) as wildly inflated even then, and to compound the problem, Monte dei Paschi paid cash. Stretched, it turned to a series of transactions to raise money without compromising its capital base, a development that would run afoul of banking regulations. Enter JPMorgan. The American bank helped Monte dei Paschi raise about 1 billion euros with securities that had features of both ordinary shares and bonds. As long as Monte dei Paschi remained profitable, the notes would pay a fixed dividend, much like a bond payment, of about 5 percent. But if it got into trouble, the dividends would stop and the notes would be treated as shares.

According to the Bank of Italy, the country's central bank, managers at Monte dei Paschi concealed certain features of the transaction. ""M.P.S. did not disclose to the Bank of Italy significant parts of the operation in question,"" said Paola Ansuini, a spokeswoman for the central bank, in an e-mail, referring to Monte dei Paschi and the notes designed by JPMorgan. Prosecutors are examining the transaction as part of a broad inquiry into the events that led to Monte dei Paschi's problems. There is no evidence that JPMorgan did anything illegal. While critical of JPMorgan and other investment banks, Mr. Profumo, Monte dei Paschi's chairman, said it was the Italian bank's responsibility to keep regulators informed. JPMorgan declined to comment. There is little question, though, that JPMorgan helped enable an acquisition that was regarded as foolish by many people and that severely weakened Monte dei Paschi. Later, Deutsche Bank of Germany and Nomura of Japan undertook transactions with previous management at Monte dei Paschi that helped it conceal losses of 730 million euros, raising further questions about the conduct of investment banks. Though his office is fit for a Renaissance prince, it is hard to see why Mr. Profumo would want the job. His salary is the equivalent of about $80,000 a year, and he is not likely to make many new friends in Siena. Along with Fabrizio Viola, Monte dei Paschi's chief executive since last year, Mr. Profumo is dismantling the patronage system that has prevailed for so long -- and cutting costs. He and Mr. Viola have purged politically connected officials from the bank's management, closed hundreds of branches and negotiated an agreement with unions to eliminate about 4,000 jobs. He said he could not rule out the possibility that Monte dei Paschi would be sold -- a prospect many Sienese consider unthinkable. ""The role of Monte dei Paschi will be to be a good bank,"" Mr. Profumo said. ""We will not be the employer of last resort. We will not be the lender of last resort. We will be a good bank. That's enough.""",Nowhere are Monte dei Paschi's problems more acutely felt than in Siena.
