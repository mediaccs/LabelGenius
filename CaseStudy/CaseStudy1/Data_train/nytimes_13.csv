Education,"Students Rush to Web Classes, but Profits May Be Much Later",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/education/massive-open-online-courses-prove-popular-if-not-lucrative-yet.html,"More top colleges are offering free massive open online courses, but companies and universities still need to figure out a way to monetize them.

Students Rush to Web Classes, but Profits May Be Much Later

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- In August, four months after Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng started the online education company Coursera, its free college courses had drawn in a million users, a faster launching than either Facebook or Twitter. The co-founders, computer science professors at Stanford University, watched with amazement as enrollment passed two million last month, with 70,000 new students a week signing up for over 200 courses, including Human-Computer Interaction, Songwriting and Gamification, taught by faculty members at the company's partners, 33 elite universities. In less than a year, Coursera has attracted $22 million in venture capital and has created so much buzz that some universities sound a bit defensive about not leaping onto the bandwagon. Other approaches to online courses are emerging as well. Universities nationwide are increasing their online offerings, hoping to attract students around the world. New ventures like Udemy help individual professors put their courses online. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have each provided $30 million to create edX. Another Stanford spinoff, Udacity, has attracted more than a million students to its menu of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, along with $15 million in financing.

Coursera has grown at warp speed to emerge as the current leader of the pack, striving to support its business by creating revenue streams through licensing, certification fees and recruitment data provided to employers, among other efforts. But there is no guarantee that it will keep its position in the exploding education technology marketplace. ""No one's got the model that's going to work yet,"" said James Grimmelmann, a New York Law School professor who specializes in computer and Internet law. ""I expect all the current ventures to fail, because the expectations are too high. People think something will catch on like wildfire. But more likely, it's maybe a decade later that somebody figures out how to do it and make money."" For their part, Ms. Koller and Mr. Ng proclaim a desire to keep courses freely available to poor students worldwide. Education, they have said repeatedly, should be a right, not a privilege. And even their venture backers say profits can wait.

""Monetization is not the most important objective for this business at this point,"" said Scott Sandell, a Coursera financier who is a general partner at New Enterprise Associates. ""What is important is that Coursera is rapidly accumulating a body of high-quality content that could be very attractive to universities that want to license it for their own use. We invest with a very long mind-set, and the gestation period of the very best companies is at least 10 years."" But with the first trickles of revenue now coming in, Coursera's university partners expect to see some revenue sooner.

""We'll make money when Coursera makes money,"" said Peter Lange, the provost of Duke University, one of Coursera's partners. ""I don't think it will be too long down the road. We don't want to make the mistake the newspaper industry did, of giving our product away free online for too long."" Right now, the most promising source of revenue for Coursera is the payment of licensing fees from other educational institutions that want to use the Coursera classes, either as a ready-made ""course in a box"" or as video lectures students can watch before going to class to work with a faculty member. Ms. Koller has plenty of other ideas, as well. She is planning to charge $20, or maybe $50, for certificates of completion. And her company, like Udacity, has begun to charge corporate employers, including Facebook and Twitter, for access to high-performing students, starting with those studying software engineering. This fall, Ms. Koller was excited about news she was about to announce: Antioch University's Los Angeles campus had agreed to offer its students credit for successfully completing two Coursera courses, Modern and Contemporary American Poetry and Greek and Roman Mythology, both taught by professors from the University of Pennsylvania. Antioch would be the first college to pay a licensing fee -- Ms. Koller would not say how much -- to offer the courses to its students at a tuition lower than any four-year public campus in the state.

Why would colleges pay licensing fees for material available free on the Web? Because, Ms. Koller said crisply, Coursera's terms of use require that anyone using the courses commercially get a license, and because licensing would give colleges their own course Web site, including access to grades. Just three days before the announcement, Ms. Koller discovered that the deal would have a very modest start. For the pilot, Antioch planned to have just one student and a faculty ""facilitator"" in each course. She expressed surprise but took the news in stride, moving right on to greet a delegation from the University of Melbourne that was waiting for her in the conference room. Coursera recently announced another route to help students earn credit for its courses -- and produce revenue. The company has arranged for the American Council on Education, the umbrella group of higher education, to have subject experts assess whether several courses are worthy of transfer credits. If the experts say they are, students who successfully complete those courses could take an identity-verified proctored exam, pay a fee and get an ACE Credit transcript, a certification that 2,000 universities already accept for credit. Under Coursera's contracts, the company gets most of the revenue; the universities keep 6 percent to 15 percent of the revenue, and 20 percent of gross profits. The contracts describe several monetizing possibilities, including charging for extras like manual grading or tutoring. (How or if partner universities will share revenue with professors who develop online courses remains an open question on many campuses, with some professors saying the task is analogous to writing a textbook and should yield similar remuneration.)

""It's just a couple thousand, but it's our first revenue,"" Ms. Koller said. ""When faculty recommend a textbook and people buy it on Amazon, we get some money. The funny thing is that we're getting more than twice as much money from things like Texas Rangers jackets as from what the textbooks are bringing in."" Other possibilities around the edges include charging a subscription fee, after a class is over, to continue the discussion forum as a Web community, or perhaps offering follow-up courses, again for a fee. And advertising sponsorships remain a possibility. Like the Antioch deal, some early attempts have gotten off to a slow start. For example, the University of Washington has already offered credit for a fee in a few Coursera courses. But while thousands of students enrolled in the free version, only a handful chose the paid credit-carrying option. David P. Szatmary, the vice provost, said part of the problem was that the credit option was posted only shortly before the course started, when most students had already enrolled free. ""We're going to try it again,"" he said. ""We think that if students know about the possibility of doing it for credit, they might be willing to pay a fee and get their own discussion board, an instructor who guides them through the course and some additional readings and projects."" Some Coursera partners say they are in no hurry to cash in. ""Part of what Coursera's gotten right is that it makes more sense to build your user base first and then figure out later how to monetize it, than to worry too much at the beginning about how to monetize it,"" said Edward Rock, a law professor serving as the University of Pennsylvania's senior adviser on open course initiatives.

The Coursera co-founders have become oracles of higher education, spreading their gospel of massive open online courses at the World Economic Forum in Abu Dhabi, the Web Summit in Dublin and the Aspen Ideas Festival. They describe how free online courses can open access to higher education to anyone with an Internet connection; liberate professors from repeating the same tired lectures and jokes semester after semester; and generate data, because the computers capture every answer right or wrong, that can provide new understanding of how students learn best. Many educators predict that the bulk of MOOC revenues will come from licensing remedial courses and ""gateway"" introductory courses in subjects like economics or statistics, two categories of classes that enroll hundreds of thousands of students a year. Even though less than 10 percent of MOOC students finish the courses they sign up for on their own, many experts believe that combining MOOC materials with support from a faculty member or a teaching assistant could increase completion rates. The University of Pennsylvania has high hopes for the mass marketing of Robert Ghrist's single-variable calculus course, which starts this month and features his hand-drawn animations. ""What Rob has done is figure out how to make PowerPoint dance,"" Mr. Rock said. ""I think it'll revolutionize the teaching of calculus both by allowing kids to take it on Coursera and by making the normal textbooks obsolete. It could become a way that more high schools that want to offer BC Calc can do so, and junior colleges that don't have good quality calculus instruction can license it and use it in a blended format, with the teacher now not giving frontal lectures but answering questions and exploring concepts in great detail."" Mr. Rock, whose university has produced 16 Coursera courses, said each one costs about $50,000 to create, the biggest expenses being the videography and paying the teaching assistants who monitor the discussion forum. The University of Pennsylvania is just beginning to think about how to recover those costs. Last fall, at the conclusion of its Listening to World Music course, for example, the university sent out a questionnaire asking students whether they would be interested in a follow-up course, what they would want to cover and how much they would be willing to pay for it. Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a Penn bioethicist who served as health adviser to the Obama administration, is teaching two Coursera courses: one on the Obama health care law, the other on rationing scarce medical resources. He said he was not trying to produce a course that can be offered over and over, with no additional costs, but simply hoping to spread understanding of important health issues. And rather than reuse his materials from last summer's course on the new law, Dr. Emanuel overhauled the course, using not one but two videographers to film his live classes at Penn.","New companies are partnering with universities to offer online courses, in an effort that could define the future of higher education — if anyone can figure out how to make money.",f2e5163c-11a6-5c02-ac1a-5d9cc32a4fad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/07/education/07online_cnd/07online_cnd-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=ab0bf81baa3a2d8ee95468f261eaf33aa4fe8508ccf6232ef678674d818323ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Programmers Leith Abdulla, left, Jaran Charumilind and Bipin Suresh joked around at Coursera offices in Mountain View, Calif.",f2e5163c-11a6-5c02-ac1a-5d9cc32a4fad,N24News/imgs/f2e5163c-11a6-5c02-ac1a-5d9cc32a4fad.jpg,22
Science,Rays From Exploding Stars May Help Measure Strength of Thunderstorms,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/science/rays-from-exploding-stars-may-help-measure-strength-of-thunderstorms.html,"Scientists measure electric fields in thunderclouds with instruments aboard airplanes and weather balloons, but during violent conditions these methods can be difficult, even dangerous.

Now researchers may have found a better way to measure these electrical fields: the cosmic rays that originate from exploding stars.

When cosmic rays hit the Earth's atmosphere, they create a shower of high-energy particles. Researchers in the Netherlands measured the radio emissions generated by these showers and found that they varied markedly during fair weather and thunderstorms. The differences may provide an effective way to estimate the electric field in a thunderhead.

Monitoring a cloud's electric field is important because it helps define the power of a thunderstorm, said Heino Falcke, an astrophysicist at Radboud University and one of the study's authors.","Showers of high-energy particles from cosmic rays had different radio emissions depending on the weather, possibly providing a way to measure a thunderhead.'",79a9d2c1-62f6-5a55-b258-3e8ffa0d61aa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/28/science/28OBS/28OBS-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=2865b62ada30c02f733e3ed56c95d08ca5a349f609b692d2defaf33a34a87232&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"When cosmic rays hit Earth's atmosphere, they create a shower of high-energy particles.",79a9d2c1-62f6-5a55-b258-3e8ffa0d61aa,N24News/imgs/79a9d2c1-62f6-5a55-b258-3e8ffa0d61aa.jpg,2
Theater,"In Characters Ancient and Contemporary, Women Discover Their Power Onstage",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/24/theater/electra-simon-abkarian-paris.html,"PARIS -- Twenty-five centuries after they first appeared onstage, the mythological siblings Electra and Orestes are capturing theatermakers' imaginations all over again. Last spring, the Belgian director Ivo van Hove applied a thick coat of mud to two Euripides plays about their family saga at the Comedie-Francaise; Milo Rau took the pair to Iraq for ""Orestes in Mosul,"" a production created in part with local actors. Now, Electra has found a new home in ""Electre des Bas-Fonds"" (""Electra in the Underworld""), presented here at the Theatre du Soleil. The update? She discovers sisterhood in a brothel as she plots to avenge her father's murder. This new take on the ancient Greek myth is the work of the French actor and director Simon Abkarian, perhaps best known internationally as a Bond villain (he played a corrupt contractor in 2006's ""Casino Royale""). Instead of turning to the work of Aeschylus, Sophocles or Euripides, the Greek playwrights who all tackled Electra's story, Mr. Abkarian has opted to rewrite it entirely. Happily, his version feels at once old and new, in good part thanks to the dance and music seamlessly woven into it. This renewed appetite for the murderous duo might well speak to a fascination with the cycle of revenge in our polarized times. Most versions of Electra and Orestes' story go something like this: Their sister Iphigenia was sacrificed by their father, Agamemnon, to court the gods' favor before the Trojan War, leaving their mother, Clytemnestra, heartbroken. When Agamemnon returned after the conflict, Clytemnestra and her lover, Aegisthus, murdered him, before banishing Electra and Orestes. Years later, the siblings return to avenge their father.

Blood will have blood, in other words, and Mr. Abkarian's characters hew closely to that primal hunger for retribution. His Electra (a gritty performance from Aurore Fremont) finds kindred spirits among marginalized prostitutes yet remains a virgin, and tells her brother that there is ""a tiger in her heart."" Orestes, played with poise by Assaad Bouab, is here a softer soul when the play opens, hiding among a community of sacred dancers in a temple. And yet even he is ultimately compelled to return to the dysfunctional family fold.

These are outsize characters, and while ""Electre des Bas-Fonds"" updates aspects of the story, Mr. Abkarian wisely steers clear of realism. His spare production relies instead on the unusual configuration of the Theatre du Soleil: There are no wings from which the actors can step out, but the stage opens to the right onto an additional room that can be seen through windows. It is occupied by the musical trio Howlin' Jaws, whose spirited rock and blues soundtrack is heard throughout the performance. Meanwhile, actors-dancers (as the cast members are listed) frequently enter through a large box at the back of the stage that feels, at the height of the violence, like Pandora's box. Mr. Abkarian isn't the first director to turn to dance to lend added force to this particular story: Mr. van Hove enlisted the help of the choreographer Wim Vandekeybus in the ritualistic scenes of his ""Electre/Oreste."" The performers in ""Electre des Bas-Fonds"" work in a very different style, however. The choreography, credited to the entire cast, is clearly indebted to Kathakali, a classical Indian style, as shown by the dancers' heavy stamping steps and expressive hands. It's especially suited to the sacred temple where Orestes, we're told, has been taught to dance and lives in disguise as a woman. The cross-dressing is a welcome addition by Mr. Abkarian: Orestes travels in the same costume, which helps explain why neither Electra nor Clytemnestra initially recognizes him. By contrast, as Electra, Ms. Fremont leans into androgynous movement, and initially seems like the more vindictive character. In this context, the conclusion of ""Electre des Bas-Fonds"" misses the mark slightly. Instead of allowing the siblings to kill Clytemnestra together, as is the case in some versions of the story, Mr. Abkarian leaves the gruesome task to Orestes. This jars with the way the rest of the play emphasizes the plight of women, using free verse that walks a fine line between modern psychology and the plot's mythological roots.

The brothel's prostitutes, each with individual stories, form an effective chorus, although some scenes revel in the details of their sexual slavery a little too complacently. One oft-forgotten character, Electra's sister Chrysothemis, played by Rafaela Jirkovsky, also gets her due here. Of the Greek versions, she appears only in Sophocles' ""Electra,"" as an obedient child who defers to Clytemnestra. Here, when Aegisthus threatens to shave Electra's hair, she sacrifices herself and stops the punishment by agreeing to sleep with him. Ms. Jirkovsky's soliloquy after the event is hauntingly eloquent, and adds another layer to the family's trauma.

At the Centquatre, a multidisciplinary arts venue in the north of Paris, another woman found her inner tiger this month in ""Stallone"" -- albeit in far more mundane ways. In this adaptation of a short story by Emmanuele Bernheim, a 25-year-old medical secretary, Lise, experiences an epiphany while watching Sylvester Stallone's 1982 film ""Rocky III."" It's a quirky premise for an engrossing, if bittersweet, journey of self-discovery. Clotilde Hesme, seen in Christophe Honore's film ""Love Songs"" and in the TV series ""The Returned,"" tells Lise's story on an empty stage. She is accompanied only by Pascal Sangla, who plays a handful of roles while mixing the soundtrack, which repeatedly refers to Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger,"" the theme song of ""Rocky III."" Ms. Hesme's is a finely drawn portrait. More often than not, she speaks in the third person, as in the original text, which is effective in shaping her initially self-effacing character. She moves very little, yet when she rolls her ankles to suggest Lise's run down the street after seeing the film, we see a woman suddenly flexing muscles that she'd forgotten she had. Somewhat frustratingly, this unconventional motivation ultimately leads Lise to embrace a conventional definition of success. She goes back to medical school, graduates, gets married and has children. While she remains faithful to Mr. Stallone, seeing every one of his films and, oddly, setting aside money for him in case his career falters, her own fight gives way to a state of contentment Rocky wouldn't exactly recognize. On the other hand, Ms. Hesme embodies the quiet strength underneath Lise's gentle disposition. By adapting ""Stallone"" for the stage, she and her director, Fabien Gorgeart, may also spark renewed interest in the work of Ms. Bernheim, a gifted French writer who died in 2017. Her heroine may not be as daring as Electra, but she becomes exactly who she wanted to be.","In Paris, the mythological Greek character Electra can once again be found in a theater, while the heroine of a quirky new play is inspired by ""Rocky III.""",1e051afd-0016-5255-b259-5b2898c89388,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/24/arts/24paristheater01/24paristheater01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=c2a075b65b162898b55fef13f6130a25a92ed4893d6f2857ead1519796d7d543&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Aurore Frémont, foreground, and Nathalie Le Boucher in ""Électre des Bas-Fonds,""  directed by Simon Akbarian at the Théâtre du Soleil.",1e051afd-0016-5255-b259-5b2898c89388,N24News/imgs/1e051afd-0016-5255-b259-5b2898c89388.jpg,10
Dance,A Master of Dance Lighting Steps Out of the Shadows,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/dance/guggenheim-brandon-stirling-baker-justin-peck.html,"The lighting designer Brandon Stirling Baker, whose work will take center stage with ""The Choreography of Light,"" part of the Guggenheim's Works & Process series. Credit...Vincent Tullo for The New York Times



The lighting designer Brandon Stirling Baker, whose work will take center stage with ""The Choreography of Light,"" part of the Guggenheim's Works & Process series.

It's easy to understand why lighting is essential to dance performance. Dancing in the dark is hard to see. But when Brandon Stirling Baker says he wants his lighting design to be essential, he means something different. For Mr. Baker, 31, who recently became the lighting director for Boston Ballet, good lighting design is integral to a dance, inseparable from its moods and meanings. It doesn't follow, however, that the lighting should grab attention. ""Brandon's contributions are in support of the choreographer's vision,"" said Justin Peck, the resident choreographer at New York City Ballet. Their careers have risen together. Mr. Peck's first major work, ""The Year of the Rabbit"" (2012), was also that of Mr. Baker, and since then, they have collaborated on nearly 20 dances. ""What I love about Brandon,"" Mr. Peck said, ""is how thorough he is, how involved."" Not all designers sit in on rehearsals, he added, but Mr. Baker is ""woven into the development of the piece, and he has a lot of good ideas for the work as a whole, not just how to light it.""

Jamar Roberts, a choreographer and star dancer at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, agrees. When he and Mr. Baker were working on Mr. Roberts's ""Members Don't Get Weary,"" set to John Coltrane, they discussed many things: Should a dance about the blues have any blue in it? Should a memory of the past look murky or clear? ""And then things I had been thinking about would just show up in Brandon's lighting,"" Mr. Roberts said. ""That's why I call him the wizard."" Usually, Mr. Baker is the kind of wizard who stays behind the curtain. But on Jan. 18 and 20 he will draw attention to his own work for once with ""The Choreography of Light,"" part of the Works & Process series at the Guggenheim Museum.

One solo for Patricia Delgado -- the former Miami City Ballet dancer, who happens to be married to Mr. Peck -- is about color. ""Many choreographers are afraid of it,"" Mr. Baker said. Another solo moves through extreme angles of light, in an arc, as if from sunrise to sunset. A third, for the City Ballet principal Taylor Stanley, demonstrates the varieties of white light. ""Choreographers will often tell me, 'This is a white light dance,' and I'll ask, 'what kind of white?'"" Mr. Baker said. In a recent interview, Mr. Baker spoke about his essential but rarely discussed art: pointing out mistakes and misconceptions, revealing just how quickly he has to work and explaining the artistic satisfactions of service. ""Just being part of this thing that's bigger than I could ever be is all I ever wanted,"" he said. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. How did you get interested in something as specific as lighting for dance? I grew up as a musician playing in rock bands in Van Nuys, Calif., but I've always been deeply inspired by visual art. When I was 13, I went to see a musical and I was, like, ""Wow, lighting is this beautiful bridge between the visual spirit and the musical spirit."" In the same way that a painter may use a brush to create phrases and mix color, I'm doing that with light. And lighting also has rhythm and pace. My friends back home will say, ""Why did you give up music?"" But I never gave up music. I just use a different instrument now. But practicing stage lighting isn't quite like practicing the guitar. Right. I don't own any lights. I did study at the California Institute of the Arts. All my roommates there now work for Pixar. But one common misunderstanding is that people think of lighting designers as technicians. There's a whole different union in charge of that. So what is your role, then? To create a frame and a point of view. Like a cinematographer. I create a visual language and a color palette that is specific to each ballet. Each work should be a single statement, and the choreographer and I have to decide what it is.

That sounds like getting out of the way. It can be. When Justin Peck choreographed ""Rodeo,"" he was taking on this famous Aaron Copland score that has an enormous amount of color in it. I chose to approach it in a minimalist way, with a wide space and warm sunlight. As an artist, you have to decide what needs to come forward. The lighting for ""Rodeo"" is simple, but it's essential. It's probably my best work. When is a narrower frame appropriate? In Justin's ""Everywhere We Go,"" the first and last movements have a massive amount of dancers, and I made it extremely bright, like an arena. But there's this pas de deux that's quiet, just solo piano, and I took that as a hint and used only two follow spots. It allowed us to focus in, with an intimacy almost like a campfire. You don't let the space stay dim for long, though, unlike many other lighting designers for dance. People do come up to me and thank me, saying, ""It's good to see who's onstage for once."" What are some other mistakes you see in lighting design? Sometimes it's very obvious that the lighting was an afterthought. Or is trying to cover something up. That's why it's so important to me to work collaboratively from the beginning.

You're in on the planning all along, but how much time do you get in the actual theater before a dance has its premiere? Maybe three hours, six at the most. And usually we open that evening. It's like a cannon. First, I finally get to show the choreographer my ideas, with some people onstage who aren't the dancers, or maybe with coat racks. Then there's a run-through that doesn't stop for lights. I make choices on the fly, narrowing things down, adjusting for spacing. You have to remain creative. You're the lighting director for Boston Ballet. What's the difference between a lighting director and a lighting designer? Those terms are often confused. A lighting director maintains old works in the repertory, making sure that the lighting stays as it was at the premiere. Repertory is this amazing collection of ideas -- not just of choreography but also of lighting design. Audiences are always seeing that but maybe they don't know it. And this Guggenheim event is to help make them aware? I hope to give the audience a closer look at what I do. The work is never about me. But I do want them to know that we lighting designers are there.","Brandon Stirling Baker talks about his essential but rarely discussed art, pointing out mistakes and misconceptions, and the joys of collaboration.",eebf7266-0c1d-5749-9969-193085e2a364,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/arts/13BRANDONBAKER1/13BRANDONBAKER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=40afdbda4661023e9f94622ccb8f3c8373cb7be7cc8951135cb382b962d90311&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The lighting designer Brandon Stirling Baker, whose work will take center stage with &ldquo;The Choreography of Light,&rdquo; part of the Guggenheim&rsquo;s Works &amp; Process series.<a href=""https://www.guggenheim.org/event/choreography-of-light-by-brandon-stirling-baker-with-jamar-roberts-sarah-daley-and-patricia-delgado""><br /></a>",eebf7266-0c1d-5749-9969-193085e2a364,N24News/imgs/eebf7266-0c1d-5749-9969-193085e2a364.jpg,6

Economy,"As China Curbs Borrowing, Growth Shows Signs of Faltering",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/business/economy/china-economy-debt-interest-rates.html,"A factory in Hangzhou, China. An economic slowdown in the country -- coupled with the knock-on effects of widening trade disputes and slowing growth in Europe -- may augur poorly for the global economy.

SHANGHAI -- China's government has been trying to break the country's addiction to ever-rising debt, but its effort to crack down on easy money is starting to hit growth in the world's second-biggest economy. Beijing has been concerned in recent years about the increased reliance on credit to keep the economy expanding briskly, worrying that it could lead to a financial crisis, or to a long period of stagnation like the one in Japan after the real estate market burst in the early 1990s. But curbing debt may have significant consequences in China and elsewhere. Countries around the world are much more closely tied to China than ever before, because of its role not just as the world's biggest manufacturer by far but also, increasingly, as a consumer. An economic slowdown in China -- coupled with the knock-on effects of widening trade disputes and slowing growth in Europe -- may augur poorly for a global economy that even recently seemed in rude health. Domestically, China's credit crackdown has affected smaller businesses hardest. Though the country often appears to be dominated by its vast conglomerates and hulking state-owned enterprises, its economy is, in reality, somewhat more reliant on small businesses than its Western counterparts. And the way Beijing has gone about curbing lending in recent months is unintentionally hitting the most entrepreneurial segments of the economy, the governor of China's central bank acknowledged in a speech on Thursday in Shanghai.

Over all, there is growing evidence that a credit crunch is taking a toll on the Chinese economy. The National Bureau of Statistics released data in Beijing on Thursday showing that investment, retail sales and industrial production all slowed in May. The slowdowns in investment and retail sales were particularly sharp and unexpected. With that backdrop of eroding economic growth, the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank, conspicuously did not match on Thursday the Federal Reserve's increase to interest rates on Wednesday. It had at least partly matched previous Federal Reserve interest rate rises since the autumn. An index of 300 large-company stocks traded in Shanghai and Shenzhen dropped 0.4 percent on Thursday, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong fell 0.9 percent on the poor economic news from the mainland. With the Chinese economy showing signs of slowing and the authorities making it harder to borrow, small businesses are particularly vulnerable. They represent about three-fifths of economic output in China, compared with around half in Germany, Japan and the United States, according to Yi Gang, the governor of the People's Bank of China. Now many of those small businesses are struggling for loans because of a wide-ranging government crackdown. Moody's and Standard & Poor's both downgraded China's sovereign debt credit rating last year because of concerns about the country's debt overhang.

The downgrades were among many reasons the government has tightened some curbs on borrowing since the end of the autumn. Beijing has particularly clamped down on lending by online finance companies and other private sector businesses that bypass the state-controlled banking system.

While commercial banks have continued to lend the money they hold from deposits, these conventional loans go mainly to state-owned enterprises. Private lenders, meanwhile, charge interest rates that are double or triple the 6 percent charged by banks, but they are often the only source of financing for small businesses. Despite the higher interest rates, ""we should also fully affirm the significance of private loans, which are an important supplement"" to bank lending in the Chinese economy, said Mr. Yi, speaking at the Lujiazui Forum, a gathering in Shanghai of China's top financial regulators. The forum, held at the start of each summer, is one of the Chinese government's main channels for signaling the direction of Chinese monetary and financial policy. Even before deciding on Thursday morning not to match the Fed's rate increase, though, the Chinese government had already made a pair of moves that appear to have been elaborately crafted to channel more money to smaller, more entrepreneurial businesses. At the start of this month, the central bank said that commercial banks could use some of their small-business loans as collateral for borrowing money at low interest rates directly from the central bank. And on April 17, it told commercial banks that they could reduce the amount of money they set aside unprofitably as reserves, provided that they took actions that would leave them with more cash to lend to small and midsize businesses.

 Gary Liu, the president of the China Financial Reform Institute, a Shanghai-based research group, said on the sidelines of the Lujiazui Forum that China's private-sector companies of all sizes, even large ones, had long faced challenges in obtaining loans. But the credit squeeze on them this spring has been particularly painful. ""It's very bad, and we see not just small and medium-sized enterprises defaulting but even big companies defaulting,"" he said.

Some financial regulators nevertheless appear determined to maintain the crackdown on informal lending. Speaking at the forum, Guo Shuqing, the chairman of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, called for further rigor. He warned the audience against putting money into the dwindling number of online finance companies that still offered high returns on investment. While some informal lending operations provide valuable credit to small businesses, others have proved to be fraudulent. ""You need to report them so we can find all these Ponzi-type schemes,"" Mr. Guo said. China's financial policymakers have made clear that they do not mind seeing a few defaults and some strains in the system. Retail auto sales slackened last month, and unsold cars have started accumulating at dealerships. A decision by the authorities to allow at least a dozen bond defaults in recent weeks, after years of preventing them, has rattled some investors. The Chinese economy is not crashing. By international standards, the pace of bond defaults is still negligible. While car sales have leveled off, they have done so at a very high level after two decades of strong growth, causing chronic traffic jams. Real estate demand is still buoyant, and so is the construction industry. But faced with a high level of debt across the economy, ""what regulators need to be careful is not to respond in such a heavy-handed way that it could essentially compound the risks,"" said Fred Hu, an influential Chinese economist who is now a hedge fund chairman in Hong Kong.","The country's focus on reducing its debt has left small businesses facing a credit crunch, and the economy appears to be slowing.",dc275b8b-a20f-585d-9893-3776314a3fd1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/15/business/15china-economy-print/15china-economy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=358152c1bd199a2b7ed8418a655f47e138698afe05f3db61452d3e0ad2e49113&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A factory in Hangzhou, China.

Technology,"Pentagon, With an Eye on China, Pushes for Help From American Tech",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/technology/pentagon-taiwan-tsmc-chipmaker.html,"Pentagon, With an Eye on China, Pushes for Help From American Tech

SAN FRANCISCO -- Pentagon officials have been holding private discussions with tech industry executives to wrestle with a key question: how to ensure future supplies of the advanced computer chips needed to retain America's military edge. The talks, some of which predate the Trump administration, recently took on an increased urgency, according to people who were involved or briefed on the discussions. Pentagon officials encouraged chip executives to consider new production lines for semiconductors in the United States, said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks were confidential. The discussions are being driven by the Pentagon's increased dependence on chips made abroad, especially in Taiwan, as well as recent tensions with China, these people said. One chip maker, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, better known as TSMC , plays a particularly crucial role producing commercial chips that also have applications for aircraft, satellites, drones and wireless communications. And because of unrest over the past few months in the semiautonomous Chinese territory of Hong Kong, some Pentagon officials and chip executives have wondered about situations that could force suppliers in Taiwan to limit or cut off silicon shipments, the people said.

Mark Liu, the chairman of TSMC, said he had recently discussed options for a new factory in the United States with the Commerce Department. The stumbling block was money; major subsidies would be required, he said, as it is more expensive to operate in America than Taiwan. ""It is all up to when we can close the cost gap,"" he said in an interview. The conversations are a sign of how federal agencies are grappling with a deep-rooted technology conundrum. The United States has long fielded the most advanced weaponry by exploiting electronic components once exclusively produced in the country. Chips help tanks, aircraft, rockets and ships navigate, communicate with one another and engage enemy targets. But domestic production lines of many chips have long since moved overseas, raising questions about supply interruptions in the event of political or military crises abroad. Those fears have been exacerbated by the increasing importance of particular components -- such as programmable chips that figure prominently in the F-35 fighter jet, which are designed by the Silicon Valley company Xilinx and mainly fabricated in Taiwan. Some chips, such as the wireless baseband processors needed for new 5G communications abilities that Pentagon officials covet, require advanced manufacturing technology that has become a key selling point of TSMC. ""We in the Defense Department cannot afford to be shut out of all of those capabilities,"" said Lisa Porter, deputy under secretary for research and engineering, in remarks at an event in July that were later widely circulated among chip makers.

In another sign of action, Skywater Technology, a Minnesota chip manufacturing service, said this week that the Defense Department would invest up to $170 million to increase its production and enhance technologies, such as the ability to produce chips that can withstand radiation in space. The Skywater investment illustrates how the Pentagon is also wrestling with how to upgrade aging technology at domestic companies that make small volumes of classified chips tailored for the military. Such ""trusted"" factories, as they are called, operate under Pentagon rules aimed at preventing sabotage or data theft. Dr. Porter and other Pentagon officials have pushed for new technical safeguards besides guards and employee background checks to keep sensitive chip designs secure, a strategy that would help the Defense Department use more advanced commercial factories. She called the idea a ""zero-trust"" philosophy. TSMC, which dominates the build-to-order services called foundries, recently took the lead from Intel in shrinking chip circuitry to give chips greater capability. Its production edge is one reason the company has continued to win business from big American chip designers such as Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia, whose chips have become increasingly important for defense as well as civilian applications. The United States remains the leading supplier and innovator in most chip technologies, including the processors that Intel sells for nearly all personal computers and server systems. But the Pentagon's research arm -- DARPA , for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- has been trying since 2017 to spur chip innovations under a $1.5 billion Electronics Resurgence Initiative.

Its goals include finding alternatives to silicon for manufacturing and packaging small ""chiplets"" together instead of making big monolithic chips. ""We have vulnerabilities we really need to address, but we are still the dominant producer of electronics in the world,"" said Mark Rosker, the director of DARPA's microsystems technology office. He said questions about the American semiconductor industry called for ""a graceful and considered kind of panic."" Much of the recent urgency stems from China's growing stature as a chip innovator. Designers there have developed chips for sensitive applications such as supercomputers. Many of the designers -- including Huawei, a key target of the Trump administration in the trade war -- also rely on TSMC for manufacturing. Another impetus for action stems from a recent pullback by GlobalFoundries. The chip maker, owned by investors in Abu Dhabi, has spent around $12 billion on a sophisticated factory in Malta, N.Y. But it announced last year that it would stop trying to create smaller circuitry than that on its existing production processes. GlobalFoundries now produces classified chips under the trusted foundry rules in two former IBM factories it took over in 2015. Company executives believe the technology in its Malta facility remains advanced enough to also serve military needs for years, and it is negotiating with officials to handle future classified work through proposed modifications to the government's trusted foundry regulations. It recently filed a lawsuit accusing TSMC of patent infringement, an action that it said was aimed partly at protecting the American manufacturing base. The company, which announced plans for a $10 billion factory in China in 2017, is also rethinking that project as the promised demand from customers there now seems uncertain, said Thomas Caufield, the chief executive of GlobalFoundries. Influencing the chip industry used to be easier when the Defense Department accounted for a major portion of chip sales. Now defense applications are dwarfed by civilian uses, such as smartphones and personal computers. More of the Pentagon's budget now goes to chips like memory and processors whose designs are shaped by commercial needs.",Talks over how U.S. companies can ensure future supplies of advanced computer chips have taken on more urgency.,bf9927ed-fa3a-58e4-b661-e639ae3fa1f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/business/00pentagonchip/00pentagonchip-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5750ea2638833e47b03def61a4204d62e2035ec8f2d5736115a9aa6a578f940d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Pentagon increasingly depends on chips made abroad, especially by companies like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.",bf9927ed-fa3a-58e4-b661-e639ae3fa1f3,N24News/imgs/bf9927ed-fa3a-58e4-b661-e639ae3fa1f3.jpg,20
Theater,Review: 'Forbidden Broadway' Sticks It to the Great Woke Way,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/21/theater/review-forbidden-broadway.html,"BEN BRANTLEY It appears an old friend of ours -- a great gossip and major theater queen -- is back in town and dying to dish. I'm talking about ""Forbidden Broadway,"" Gerard Alessandrini's 37-year-old satirical revue, which is shaking a leg with renewed vigor at the Triad Theater. We both felt the show was looking kind of burned-out the last time we saw it, in 2014. JESSE GREEN In your review of that edition -- called ""Forbidden Broadway Comes Out Swinging!"" -- you wondered whether Alessandrini was running out of targets juicy enough to satirize. In mine, I wondered whether he was running out of craft. Do you think he's found more of both this time? After all, the new edition, which he also directed, is subtitled ""The Next Generation."" BRANTLEY Well, he certainly struck fool's gold with the fabulous parody sequence called ""Woke-lahoma!,"" after Daniel Fish's politically deconstructionist interpretation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ""Oklahoma!"" GREEN I agree, but that's cherry-picking: ""Woke-lahoma!"" -- ""There's a bright glaring light on the bleachers/There's an ugly green light on my features"" -- is the show's highlight. It has all the elements of the best ""Forbidden Broadway"" sketches: delicious mimicry, a pungent theme (in this case, politically correct revivals) and well-crafted lyrics that are also on point.

BRANTLEY Your ""but"" implies you don't think the show sustained that level of acuity. Which is true but forgivable, I think. There are sequences in this version that feel like they were conceived on autopilot. (The ""Dear Evan Hansen"" spoof, reimagined as ""Dear Evan Has-Been,"" feels like a retread of Alessandrini's ""Annie"" schtick of years ago, about the built-in obsolescence of child stars.) On the other hand, the backward- and forward-looking scope of the show -- and even its patchiness -- kind of mirrors the unresolved personality of Broadway itself these days. GREEN I agree, which is why I think this edition is the best in recent memory, even accounting for dud elements like the ""Hadestown"" number. There's also a pro forma spoof of ""Moulin Rouge"" as ""Moulin Rude"" that includes a Karen Olivo/Marilyn Monroe mash-up called ""Diamonds Out My Wazoo."" It captures the musical's vulgarity, but that's a low bar. BRANTLEY On the other hand, going to a ""Forbidden Broadway"" is for me like sitting down and schmoozing with a friend who shares an obsession. And true obsessives can't embrace Broadway without dancing with its ghosts a bit. The recent ""Fosse/Verdon"" television series gives Alessandrini the peg to riff (delightfully, I thought) on our enduring fascination with a mythic Broadway past, when stars' talents were often matched by their self-destructiveness.

BRANTLEY Wasn't that bliss? The number starts out with Garland complaining that Zellweger has dared to impersonate her in the current film ""Judy."" And the frame for her lamentation is a reworking of ""Zing! Went the Strings of My Heart"" as ""Zellweger Smells in My Part!"" That's a great example of Alessandrini's ability to create a, uh, zingy dialogue between the musical comedy world of then and now, and between the rivalrous forms of Broadway and Hollywood musicals. GREEN He also takes some shots at nonmusicals in this edition. One is a well-aimed zap at Jez Butterworth's ""The Ferryman,"" reframing ""How Are Things in Glocca Morra?"" from ""Finian's Rainbow"" as ""How Are Things in Irish Drama?""

BRANTLEY Ah, that one pierces Butterworth's lugubriousness and luridness right in the solar plexus. I also enjoyed Chris Collins-Pisano and Immanuel Houston celebrating (and gently skewering) the new creed of inclusivity by embodying (respectively) Lin-Manuel Miranda and Billy Porter. (""Everyone now has a chance to play Mama Rose,"" sings Porter, to the tune of ""Everything's Coming Up Roses."") GREEN Another reason I liked this edition, which features the tireless Fred Barton at the piano, is that it's not just an excuse for mockery but also an opportunity for reflection. The idea that Broadway is being passed from old hands to new ones is touchingly addressed in a couple of numbers. One of them imagines three classic divas -- Bette Midler (Stern again), Bernadette Peters (Aline Mayagoitia) and Jennifer Holliday (Houston in drag) -- singing ""There's Gotta Be Something for Us to Do,"" based on the great ""Sweet Charity"" number. And then there's the closing sequence, centered on ""Our Time"" from ""Merrily We Roll Along,"" which I found unexpectedly moving. BRANTLEY Yep, I misted up at that point. Alessandrini knows which old songs will forever push a Broadway-phile's buttons. He takes ""You'll Never Walk Alone"" from ""Carousel"" and retools it for his current team (which also includes a bona fide next-generation member, the adolescent Joshua Turchin). And he adds a sweet dig to offset the sentimentality, as these performers realize that being in a spoof like this might mean ""You'll Never Work Again."" GREEN Framing the sequence is the great Broadway director Harold Prince (Collins-Pisano) reimagined as the heavenly Starkeeper from ""Carousel."" You could not find a more potent avatar of the world that Alessandrini adores and teases than Prince, who died in July. When the show was over, I wondered whether -- new generation or not -- Broadway would ever again supply the ripe makings of a new ""Forbidden Broadway."" BRANTLEY Might we let the weary, wily Aunt Testa (that's Stern as Mary Testa playing Aunt Eller in ""Woke-lahoma!"") have the last word? ""If ya live long enough,"" she says, ""you're going to see some bizarre theater. Hearing beautiful acoustic music played on an electric guitar, seeing Rodgers and Hammerstein staged in a gymnasium, sitting through 'The Rose Tattoo' with Marisa Tomei, watching 'Company' with a female Bobby ... and Patti LuPone."" Bless that ole gal, her crustiness gives me hope. Forbidden Broadway: The Next Generation

Technology,Marissa Mayer Will Make $186 Million on Yahoo's Sale to Verizon,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/technology/marissa-mayer-will-make-186-million-on-yahoos-sale-to-verizon.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Yahoo shareholders will vote June 8 on whether to sell the company's internet businesses to Verizon Communications for $4.48 billion. A yes vote, which is widely expected, would end Marissa Mayer's largely unsuccessful five-year effort to restore the internet pioneer to greatness.

But Ms. Mayer, the company's chief executive, will be well compensated for her failure. Her Yahoo stock, stock options and restricted stock units are worth a total of $186 million, based on Monday's stock price of $48.15, according to data filed on Monday in the documents sent to shareholders about the Verizon deal.

That compensation, which will be fully vested at the time of the shareholder vote, does not include her salary and bonuses over the past five years, or the value of other stock that Ms. Mayer has already sold. All told, her time at Yahoo will have netted her well over $200 million, according to calculations based on company filings.

Ms. Mayer did give up additional equity compensation that she would have received in 2017 as a penalty for her management team's failure to act on a 2014 breach of the company's systems that led to the theft of data on 500 million users.

Bogdan Docu, the general manager of the Nolitan hotel, on Kenmare Street, where Mr. Cailan was beverage director since June 2018, confirmed that the sommelier no longer worked there in an email on Thursday. Mr. Cailan is also no longer employed at the hotel's restaurant, the Usual, where his brother, Alvin, remains the chef.

Anthony Cailan, 29, is alleged to have sexually assaulted, or attempted to assault, at least four women, two of whom described the incidents in detail in The Times and were named in the article. Mr. Cailan responded last week: ""The truth is, these allegations against me are false. I look forward to the opportunity to clear my name."" He could not be reached for comment this week by email or phone.

Sports,"P.S.G. Outclasses United, at Last Blending Grit With Its Goals",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/sports/soccer/psg-manchester-united-champions-league.html,"MANCHESTER, England -- That sinking feeling, that sense that it was all happening again to Paris St.-Germain, might have set in a couple of weeks ago, when Neymar limped off a field in Strasbourg, his face crumpled with tears, the fifth metatarsal in his right foot broken. Or it might not have come until a little later, until last weekend, until the point when Edinson Cavani, wincing from the pain in his hip, was told he would not be able to return to the field at the Parc des Princes for the second half of a Ligue 1 game against Bordeaux. Or maybe it was not the injuries, but the composite effect of them: Maybe it was the slow drift in P.S.G.'s performances these last few weeks -- their first domestic defeat of the season, at Lyon; being taken to extra time in a cup game by Villefranche, a third-division team; squeezing past Bordeaux, once Cavani had gone.

It all pointed in the same direction: that just as the mercury was rising and thoughts were turning once again to the Champions League, the most ambitious club project in Europe, the team that has distorted the transfer market and -- allegedly -- bent the rules in its relentless pursuit of success in this competition, was splintering and fracturing and crumbling once again.

Suddenly, it felt as if a meeting in the last 16 with Manchester United was rather more daunting than it had seemed when the draw was made, back in December, back before Neymar's tears, back before Cavani's grimace, back before Villefranche. That was partly because of P.S.G.'s travails, of course, but partly because United looked reinvigorated. More than that, in fact: United looked like a completely different team, with completely different players, the gray clouds of Jose Mourinho's moody, miserable tenure replaced by the unending sunlight of Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. Solskjaer had not lost a game as United manager before Tuesday's visit from P.S.G. He had restored Paul Pogba -- a virus, in Mourinho's estimation -- to his position as one of the world's finest midfielders. Anthony Martial and Marcus Rashford were thriving, too. Old Trafford had its smile back, a predator's grin, ready to become the latest place where P.S.G.'s finest-laid plans fell to pieces, just as they had at the Bernabeu last year, and at the Etihad and the Nou Camp in the years before that.

And then, just when it was happening again, it did not. P.S.G. produced a performance not just of class but of cunning and courage, and swatted Manchester United aside, 2-0. Presnel Kimpembe and Kylian Mbappe -- this great international vision, this expression of Qatari soft power, delivered by two boys from Paris's sprawling banlieues -- scored a goal each, and P.S.G. might feel slightly disappointed not to have left with more. Later on, Pogba -- against his hometown club -- was sent off, meaning United's standout performer will miss the return leg next month. With his exit, all reasonable hope of a turnaround in Paris departed, too. As it turned out, the harbinger of what was to come here was not Neymar's injury, or Cavani's, or any of the other feints and misdirections offered by P.S.G. in recent weeks. Instead, it was in November, in the aftermath of the French champion's victory against Liverpool in the opening stage of this competition. It was then, as his players danced on the field, celebrating a victory in a group-stage game -- one high on tension and fraught with traps, admittedly, but still a group-stage game -- that Thomas Tuchel, P.S.G.'s German coach, saw something. His team had not just beaten Liverpool for talent, not relied on Neymar's virtuosity or Mbappe's breathtaking speed; it had beaten them for effort, too. It had dug in and ground it out. It had proved, against a dogged, determined opponent, that it could fight, too. ""Now, we feel something,"" Tuchel said.

Those were the characteristics P.S.G. fell back upon Tuesday night in Manchester: Thiago Silva, among the club's first wave of superstar signings, all the way back in 2012, towering in defense; Marquinhos, deployed to stifle and to shadow Pogba, dominant in midfield; the bustle of Marco Verratti, the hustle of Angel Di Maria. Those are the traits that teams need to overcome these challenges, to shine on these stages, to thrive in this competition, just as much as they need star power and sublime skill. Those are the traits that, in previous years, P.S.G. has not been able to call on. It cowered against Real Madrid last season, as if waiting meekly for its fate. It melted away against Barcelona the year before that, unable or unwilling to resist as Neymar and Lionel Messi ran riot. It would be dangerous to suggest that this victory provided a blueprint for P.S.G.'s future, to use this exception to prove some wayward rule. This is not proof that P.S.G. is better without the world's most expensive player, or evidence that a project built on and seduced by star power is innately flawed. Neymar improves every team he is part of; if Tuchel harbors designs to win the Champions League, he will need the Brazilian back. Much the same goes for Cavani, as diligent and spirited a forward as might be found. Better teams than Manchester United, of which there are several, would pose more questions, and find more answers. That Tuchel found a way to win in their absence, though, suggests that something has shifted, that the P.S.G. project has reached another stage, that after years of searching for a way to win even when all seems arrayed against them, they have found what Tuchel, that night in November, called a ""new culture."" Now, they feel something. All that remains is to make sure that Neymar, and Cavani, feel it, too.","Paris St.-Germain motored past Manchester United without Neymar and Edinson Cavani.

Sports,Is This Still Soccer?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/sports/soccer/coronavirus-soccer-rules-changes.html,"In Massachusetts, rule changes brought on by the pandemic -- no contact, no tackles, no headers, no throw-ins -- are forcing soccer players and coaches to adapt to a very different game.

You're still not allowed to touch the ball with your hands. But in many other important ways, the soccer being played by Massachusetts high schools this fall differs significantly in shape and form from the soccer known and played around the rest of the world. No physical contact. No slide tackles. No headers. No throw-ins. Six feet of distance between players is required whenever play is restarted -- in other words, no walls or close marking on free kicks. And to top things off, everyone on the field must wear a mask at all times. Sports leagues across the country, from youth leagues to the pros, are implementing safety protocols this fall to try to play games amid the coronavirus pandemic. Some guidelines, on things like sharing water bottles or high-fiving or locker room use, are common sense in the coronavirus era. Others are more extreme: In Vermont, for example, high schools are playing seven-on-seven football this year, and volleyball matches are moving from indoor gyms to outdoor courts. But few have taken things as far as the state of Massachusetts, which unveiled its unusual rules for soccer on the eve of what is shaping up to be one of the strangest high school sports seasons in memory.

""I might go for a header, and I'll go, 'Wait, I can't do that,'"" she said. ""You have to take a step back and reset your mind."" The rules caused a statewide stir when they were announced in late August by the Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association, which oversees sports for almost 400 high schools in the state. They were not produced in haste: Rough drafts were shuttled from sports committees to medical committees and back again as the rules were being completed. But as the season neared, an M.I.A.A. official said, the organization was ultimately handcuffed in terms of what it could allow. The fateful moment came in August, when the state agency in charge of the latest phase of reopenings released its guidelines. Sports officials noticed almost immediately that they included a prohibition on ""deliberate contact.""

""It was a weird hybrid between soccer and girls' field hockey,"" Zach Siano, the coach of the boys' soccer team at Belchertown High School, said about his team's first game on Wednesday. (Two of the team's first three games were postponed because of coronavirus precautions.) ""It was a little difficult to watch."" Siano, whose team won a state championship last year, said the opposing team scored easily on a free kick from 20 yards because it largely went undefended; under the new rules, defensive walls are not allowed. And he said defenders were already cynically stopping dangerous attacks by triggering one of the new coronavirus contact fouls. That may actually be the only way to stop talented strikers this season. Yanchuk, 17, scored a hat trick in each of Bishop Feehan's first two games. Last season, she said, she was constantly bumped, knocked down or tripped by defenders hoping to slow her down, but this year she has not had to worry about contact. ""She's liking the freedom,"" said Phil Silva, the coach of Bishop Feehan, which also won a state championship last year.

To offset some of the new advantages for attackers, Silva moved one of his best defenders, who is one of his fastest players but also one of his shortest, from outside back into the center, where she could help neutralize newly unshackled opposing forwards. There, he said, ""it doesn't matter that she's 5-foot tall because she doesn't have to head a ball."" Complicating teams' adjustments to the new rules were other ones mandating that practices, at least initially, could take place only with players divided into groups of five to 10 players. ""I have a coach's binder with a thousand drills that's useless now,"" Siano said. Karissa Niehoff, the executive director of the National Federation of State High School Associations, said she had yet to see another state this year where the core rules of a sport were so drastically changed.

For the most part, states resuming high school sports were doing so with basic safety rules, though a few, including California, have postponed fall seasons altogether. Niehoff said that while consistency in sports across the country was typically an important goal, associations were being given a ""hall pass"" this year, given the complicated challenge of adhering to state health and safety protocols that vary widely. ""But I think if this were a normal year, we absolutely would scratch our heads a little bit and reach out and say, What's your rationale for this level of alteration?"" Niehoff said about the modified soccer rules in Massachusetts.

Many are scratching their heads anyway. ""I don't think it's made the game more socially distant,"" said Silva, the Bishop Feehan girls' coach, noting that players were still bunching up on the field. ""To me, putting masks on but keeping the rules the same would have been a much easier way to create a safe environment while still playing the game as it's supposed to be played."" But Silva said the biggest problem for him so far was the sheer number of stoppages in games. On top of all the new fouls, throw-in situations have now become indirect free kicks (which must be played on the ground) and referees regularly stop play to enforce proper spacing. ""It's really slowing down the game,"" Silva said. Referees, too, are having to adjust. Several said communication and patience were more important than ever as everyone gets on the same page. ""One of my favorite rule interpreters constantly talked about Rule 19, in a sport that only has 18 rules,"" said Jim Quinn, the president of the Eastern Massachusetts Soccer Officials' Association. ""Rule 19 is common sense.""","In Massachusetts, rule changes brought on by the pandemic — no contact, no tackles, no headers, no throw-ins — are forcing soccer players and coaches to adapt to a very different game.",c5485a0c-79ef-5b65-b6fe-384acafea4f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/08/sports/00soccer-rules-1a/00soccer-rules-1a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1ca2d9ce0673e14e56198f3583c06a93d409bf9d830ed96eb2e0ce8803d48b66&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The rules have created a pandemic-era version of the sport: No physical contact.

Media,Self-Correcting Beyond a Web Era Marked by Sensationalism,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/21/business/media/self-correcting-beyond-a-web-era-of-sensationalism.html,"The trial involving Gawker and Terry Bollea, better known as Hulk Hogan, over the publication of a sex video raised timeless legal questions about privacy and freedom of the press. The result, with the jury awarding Mr. Bollea $115 million in compensatory damages, could threaten Gawker's existence. But in many ways, the Gawker that posted the video -- an aggressive and unpredictable news and gossip site -- has already passed into memory. So, too, has an era of the web in which Gawker thrived. In the last few years, digital news sites with ambition -- even the ones, like Gawker, that had originally hailed themselves as being anti-establishment -- have undergone something of a self-correction. Vivid videos of random bedroom romps are out; a little bit of privacy is in. Readers, empowered by social media, have reshaped publications directly, by collective will. And they seem to realize that the photos and videos captured on their smartphones or elsewhere could just as easily be used against them as anyone else, including a celebrity.

""Now that 'everyone' has a 'sex tape' -- and everyone is at risk of having their sex tape published online,"" the publication of celebrity sex tapes is less justified in the eyes of readers, said Max Read, a former editor of Gawker. The online world in which these sites operate, even compared with 2012 when Gawker posted the video of Mr. Bollea, is no longer the same. Visitors increasingly arrive from social platforms -- mainly Facebook -- and those readers have far more control of how a story is received. Pleasing stories can be shared and cheered on those social platforms. Behavior deemed bad can now be shunned with immediate results. The change was evident as the verdict came down on Friday. On Twitter and elsewhere, fans of Mr. Bollea and critics -- including many journalists -- enthusiastically cheered the potential death of Gawker. Some others, shocked at the size of the award, declared it a chilling moment for the press. (Legal experts suggest that the real influence of the case, in the event that this decision is upheld, would be narrow.) But in 2012, the vast majority of Twitter posts that linked to Gawker's video were lighthearted jokes -- about Mr. Bollea's physique, about the humiliation of a childhood idol, about fame-seeking.

The user @tsayvs, who did not provide a real identity, linked to Gawker's video the day after it was posted and called Gawker's description a ""masterpiece."" After the verdict was announced and facing a cascade of messages from the affronted, he posted again: ""Am I the only one on Team Gawker here."" If he was not alone, he sure seemed to have little company. A similar sense of outrage built in 2014, when hackers posted hundreds of photos obtained from celebrities' private accounts. Publications that had previously trafficked in leaked nude photos -- including Gawker Media properties and sites like BuzzFeed -- shied away from publishing them. Instead, reporters covered the hack as news. Writers published essays examining the hack through the lens of privacy and consent; readers, frequently confronted with privacy worries of their own, were receptive. Today, the decision of whether to publish the most sensitive content often doesn't fall on publications or editors. It falls to online services that openly host videos and images, and to the social platforms on which videos and images spread.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. A video like the one that ran on Gawker might now appear on a site like LiveLeak, where people can post and distribute videos. Or it might be posted to a site like Vidme, a newer video host, or directly to Twitter, where it might be removed, only to surface again. File hosts and social networks are governed by individual terms of service. Imgur, an image site where photos from the celebrity iCloud hack were uploaded for a time, has rules that ban ""nonconsensual ('revenge') porn.""

Twitter's rules prohibit ""private and confidential information,"" including ""images or videos that are considered and treated as private under applicable laws"" -- a matter of interpretation left first to the company. Facebook, which began hosting news last year, prohibits most nudity. In addition, its guidelines state, ""Descriptions of sexual acts that go into vivid detail may also be removed."" Having rules is one thing; enforcing them is another. Large platforms usually rely on a combination of employee oversight and user reporting to identify content that violates policy. Rules are enforced primarily through after-the-fact removal, not upfront moderation. Imgur, despite a ban, still hosts a large repository of sexual material. For media organizations, that means some of the most difficult decisions are limited to deciding if, and how, to acknowledge information that seems to publish itself. A hack in which content from Sony's internal network, including email, was posted online forced editors to choose whether to access and use information that was available to anyone with a web browser. Celebrity nude photos, posted by hackers, became a news story and jumping-off point for discussions about privacy and consent. Videos of violence involving police officers, some posted directly to platforms by citizens, forced the subject into view, reverberating around the country. ISIS circumvented news outlets by uploading videos directly to video hosts. Gatekeepers had become bystanders, controlling little beyond their own participation. Gawker appears to have accepted this new reality. In July, after the site outed a male media executive for messaging a male escort, Gawker's founder, Nick Denton, who is an outspoken critic of more conventional news outlets, had the post taken down. Some of his top editors revolted and left not long after. He then announced that the site should be ""10 to 15 percent"" nicer.","By the time a jury awarded Hulk Hogan damages from Gawker for its publication of a sex tape, the site and others were already self-correcting in the direction of privacy.",796099f8-25da-5896-8816-9381ce9e3a24,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/21/business/21HOGANEFFECTSUB1/21HOGANEFFECTSUB1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=decbedffd66440254a2c81e623e40295dd195a6a0fca0592f9dbe35b6e0b4940&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nick Denton, the founder of Gawker, in a Florida courtroom before a jury awarded Hulk Hogan damages for Gawker's posting of a sex tape.",796099f8-25da-5896-8816-9381ce9e3a24,N24News/imgs/796099f8-25da-5896-8816-9381ce9e3a24.jpg,16
Food,"Frieda Caplan, Who Enlivened the Produce Aisle, Dies at 96",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/dining/frieda-caplan-dead.html,"Frieda Rapoport Caplan, a food distributor who changed the look of American produce aisles and made palates more adventurous by championing kiwifruit, enoki mushrooms, Jerusalem artichokes and countless other once-exotic items, died on Jan. 18 at her home in Los Alamitos, Calif., southeast of Los Angeles. She was 96. Cindy Sherman, head of marketing at Frieda's Specialty Produce, the company Ms. Caplan founded in 1962, confirmed her death. Ms. Caplan set about broadening the choices available to American consumers by bringing in products from South America, Australia, Asia and elsewhere and teaching retailers how to store and promote them and buyers how to prepare them. Perhaps her best-known success story involved an unloved fruit native to China. New Zealanders began growing it early in the last century, and by the early 1960s it was generally known by the off-putting name Chinese gooseberry.

Who came up with the idea of calling it kiwifruit (soon shortened to kiwi), after New Zealand's national bird, is unclear -- various versions of the story have circulated over the years -- but it's certain that Ms. Caplan began promoting this oval outcast under that name. Soon the Alpha Beta Company, a California supermarket chain, began stocking kiwis, and the fruit gradually took hold in the United States. ""What we did gained a lot of press coverage locally,"" Ms. Caplan told The New York Times in 1985. ""It was picked up nationwide, and the consumers kept coming back."" Although she entered the business at a time when the United States was very much a meat-and-potatoes country, she always had faith in the public's willingness to experiment. ""Our problem in introducing new vegetables has never been the consumer,"" she told The Times in 1979. ""It's only been with the retailer who is afraid to try anything new. When we pioneer a new item, we are willing to take a small markup to get it introduced. Then when it catches on we realize a better profit.""

Ms. Caplan earned a bachelor's degree in political science at the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1945. In 1951 she married Alfred H. Caplan, and when their first child, Karen, was born in 1955, Ms. Caplan sought a job that would have flexible enough hours to allow her to breastfeed. She asked her husband's aunt and uncle, who were managers at a wholesale produce market, if there were any such jobs available. She called on the right day; they had just lost their bookkeeper, and they brought her aboard despite her lack of bookkeeping experience or knowledge of the business. ""I knew nothing about produce or fruits and vegetables other than what I ate,"" Ms. Caplan said in ""Fear No Fruit,"" a 2015 documentary film promoted on the company's website about her. She learned other aspects of the business, including sales, and began pushing unusual products for the time, beginning with fresh mushrooms. In the early 1960s, when two stalls became available, the Southern Pacific Railroad, landlord of the market, urged her to start her own business. She did and became the go-to distributor for anyone offering something unusual. ""The other people on the market were only interested in high-volume items,"" Ms. Caplan told The Orange County Register in 2015. ""Small farmers had no place to go. Nobody was interested. So I started listening to all these small farmers."" The approach proved, well, fruitful. By 2003 the company was reported to have annual sales of about $50 million. Ms. Caplan built that success as a woman in a largely male business.

""I never had a problem with the men on the market at all,"" she said in the documentary. ""Once they got over the fact that I was a woman, and they learned they could make money with the items I was selling, I had no problems."" ""At that time,"" she told The Times in 1985, referring to her early years in the business, ""there wasn't so much interest in fresh fruits and vegetables, and we didn't have innovative produce departments. The mind-set of produce merchandisers was potatoes, onions, grapefruit and apples. It was a matter of finding people who were innovative and progressive and getting them together with people who had something to offer."" The long list of unusual edibles Ms. Caplan championed included Pepino melon from Ecuador, jicama from Mexico and starfruit from Taiwan. ""It has to have taste, it has to have food value, and it has to have shelf life,"" Ms. Caplan said, explaining what she looked for in produce.

To help unfamiliar products along, Ms. Caplan came up with the idea of packaging them with labels that explained what they were and gave advice on storage and preparation. A package of yellow Finnish potatoes, for instance, included an explanation of how they differ in flavor from ordinary russet potatoes (a buttery, sweeter taste) and recipes for a hot dish and a potato salad. Her company's endorsement could be game changing for a grower, as it was for A.V. Thomas Produce, a California farm, when it obtained a patent for the Stokes purple sweet potato in 2012 and struck a marketing deal with Frieda's.","She helped introduce kiwi, jicama and countless other unfamiliar fruits and vegetables to American consumers.",5b5bcc2f-ac85-5a75-9cd2-b61911500928,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/obituaries/26Caplan-obit2-PRINT/24Caplan-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2a1c37b2d22fd37cec149f21d6e2af115493dc7991a05703bc43154eeb4cdd46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Frieda Rapoport Caplan founded a specialty food company that introduced exotic edibles to Americans.

Global Business,G-20 Vows to Avoid a Currency War,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/business/global/24g20.html,"Moving to shore up the ""fragile and uneven"" recovery, officials from the world's 20 biggest economies promised Saturday to refrain from weakening their currencies, agreeing to let the markets exert more influence in setting foreign exchange rates. The officials also decided to give fast-growing countries a greater say at the International Monetary Fund, which monitors nations' fiscal and monetary policies, an acknowledgment that the fund's credibility required more representation from these nations. They also strengthened the I.M.F.'s role in assessing whether G-20 members were meeting their commitments. The finance ministers and central bankers were at a two-day meeting in Gyeongju, South Korea, and their actions represented another step in the effort to bridge the diverging priorities of the leading economies and ease the strain of simmering disputes. The intense talks  built largely around an agenda the Americans brought to the meeting  yielded more consensus than many officials had expected. In general, the United States refrained from putting more public pressure on China to revalue its currency, preferring instead to emphasize the benefits of reducing trade imbalances.

Seeking to find common ground on currency valuation, officials agreed to ""move toward more market-determined exchange rate systems that reflect underlying economic fundamentals."" And they pledged to ""refrain from competitive devaluation of currencies""  an effort to calm anxiety over a wave of protectionism in which countries would weaken their currencies to bolster their own exports. Threats of such a ""currency war"" have unsettled markets and threatened to hinder a flagging global recovery. The language adopted Saturday was the strongest yet from the G-20, which operates through consensus and peer pressure but lacks binding authority, following warnings by the United States that rapidly developing countries were trying to keep their currencies from rising, setting off a ""damaging cycle"" of ""competitive nonappreciation."" For their part, the richest countries, like the United States and Britain, both with large deficits, agreed to be ""vigilant against excess volatility and disorderly movements in exchange rates."" On the issue of trade, the United States failed to secure support for a numerical limit on the surplus or deficit of the nations' current account balances, the broadest measure of a country's trade and investment. The Americans had proposed that surplus and deficits be reduced to less than 4 percent of gross domestic product by 2015.

Such a deal would have obliged two export giants, China and Germany, to stimulate domestic consumption and rely less on foreign consumers. China in particular would have faced new pressure to let its currency, the renminbi, rise against the dollar. Instead, G-20 members pledged to ""pursue the full range of policies conducive to reducing excessive imbalances."" That language was not as firm as Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner had sought, but he called the pledge a step forward. ""The most important thing we achieved is agreement on a framework for curbing excess trade imbalances in the future,"" Mr. Geithner said. On Sunday, he will make a previously unannounced trip to Qingdao, China, where he was to meet with Wang Qishan, the Chinese vice premier for economic issues. The French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, said that Mr. Geithner ""probably would have liked specific targets,"" but Olli Rehn, Europe's economic and monetary affairs commissioner, said that ""setting specific numerical targets would have been easily counterproductive."" Germany, Russia and Italy were among the countries that opposed the 4 percent proposal, officials said. One significant development was the agreement on changes to how the I.M.F. is run. The G-20 agreed to transfer more than 6 percent of voting power within the I.M.F. to ""dynamic emerging-market and developing countries"" like Brazil and India by the fall of 2012.

""The legitimacy of the I.M.F. is increasing,"" Pranab Mukherjee, the Indian finance minister, said approvingly. China will become the fund's third-largest shareholder, behind the United States and Japan but ahead of Germany, France and Britain. Europe agreed to surrender two seats on the 24-member executive board. As part of a package deal, the G-20 agreed to double the I.M.F.'s quotas, which determine how much each country contributes to  and may borrow from  the institution. The quotas presently total about $340 billion. The G-20 also continued to increase the role of the I.M.F. as a watchdog over its member economies in the hope that it might help arbitrate thorny trade and currency disputes. Officials agreed to empower the I.M.F. to investigate the ""persistently large imbalances"" and determine ""the root causes"" of why adjustment had been so hard to achieve. Like the G-20, the I.M.F. cannot compel members to act, but its findings carry great weight. Yoon Jeung-hyun, the South Korean finance minister, said the agreement would help remove ""uncertainty in the global markets such as the foreign exchange rate issues."" He added, ""This will put an end to the controversy over foreign exchange rates."" George Osborne, Britain's chancellor of the Exchequer, was not quite so optimistic, though he praised the accord, saying ""this language calms everything down and gives us a route map for resolving these imbalances."" Not everyone was happy with the Americans. Several officials expressed concerns to Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, that the Fed would pour more money into the economy to stop inflation from falling and to stimulate growth, thus weakening the dollar.",Officials from the world's 20 biggest economies promised to refrain from a currency war and to give emerging economies more say.,8f6be020-a9bc-5f50-abff-11b89d620666,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/24/business/24g20span-cnd/24g20span-cnd-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=afc8a700f2c9d37b9ffd6b45aec2251eab74cf19c8bb583a85ce5c5c889d44e8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Jean-Claude Trichet, the European Central Bank president, left, and Olli Rehn, the European economic and monetary affairs commissioner, in Gyeongju, South Korea, on Saturday.",8f6be020-a9bc-5f50-abff-11b89d620666,N24News/imgs/8f6be020-a9bc-5f50-abff-11b89d620666.jpg,24
Automobiles,"When Electric Car Owners Talk, Nissan Listens",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/16/automobiles/nissan-is-listening-to-electric-car-owners-and-taking-notes.html,"A GENERATION ago, teenagers in Silicon Valley were using their parents' garages to start great American technology companies and boot up the computer revolution. Now those garages are places to plug in the electric cars that may radically change the direction of personal transportation.

Like the computer clubs that helped to foster the enthusiasm of budding programmers, gatherings of electric car owners here are providing forums for the exchange of ideas. When a group of Bay Area Leaf owners assembles for its monthly meetings, the discussions more closely resemble the E.V. technology seminars at nearby Stanford University than what you would find at the friendly neighborhood car club.

The activities in Leaf owners' groups have caught Nissan's attention. ""These groups are springing up everywhere,"" said Brendan Jones, director of marketing and sales strategy for the Leaf. ""We can't take the credit. The customers have done it on their own.""

Economy,Bank Regulator's Battle With Anti-Redlining Law Comes to an End,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/28/business/economy/community-reinvestment-act-joseph-otting.html,"Joseph Otting came into his job overseeing the nation's biggest banks in late 2017 determined to rewrite the rules governing how financial institutions invest in poor communities. A former banker appointed by President Trump, Mr. Otting had long chafed at the rules. So as Comptroller of the Currency, he wasted little time seeking the support of banks, which stood to benefit from the revision, as well as the industry's two other primary regulators, the Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and community groups. Everyone agreed that an overhaul was needed. But last week, when Mr. Otting introduced a revised rule -- his signature accomplishment as comptroller -- he cut a lonely figure. Banking trade groups said it had been put together hastily without enough testing. The Fed and F.D.I.C. refused to sign on. And community groups fear that the revision would ultimately hurt the poor. Mr. Otting, who is stepping down on Friday, is leaving behind a fractured landscape around a vital piece of banking legislation: the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, which requires banks to invest in poor communities and lend to low-income individuals in the areas where they do business.

Critics say that the revised rules have the potential to defang the C.R.A. by making it easier for banks to meet their obligations -- for example, by letting them get credit for financing a few big projects in low-income neighborhoods that they would have done anyway, rather than offering banking services, which can be less lucrative but more important to the broader community. It will also cause regulatory disarray, perhaps for years. Banks with different overseers must figure out if the new rules apply to them and spend millions of dollars to comply. Even then, the rules could change again if a Democrat is elected president in November. ""I told him: This is a legacy opportunity. If you do this right, no one will touch it for 15 or 20 years,"" said David Dworkin, the chief executive of the National Housing Conference, who worked as a senior policy adviser at the Treasury Department from 2012 until 2018. ""There are many people who believe that he wanted to gut C.R.A.,"" Mr. Dworkin said. ""I can't make that judgment, but I can say that what he has done will gut it."" Mr. Otting does not see it that way. ""I believe the rule finalized by the O.C.C. will make a positive difference for all low- and moderate-income communities across the nation -- many of which were ignored under the previous rule,"" he said in a statement to The Times last week. ""I fully support a stronger C.R.A.."" A spokesman for Mr. Otting's office said that even though the other regulators did not sign on, the banks that conduct 70 percent of the activities that are assessed under the reinvestment act are subject to the new rules. (Banks with assets below $2.5 billion can choose not to submit to the regulations.)

The reinvestment act was established to prevent redlining -- a practice in which banks refused to lend in certain neighborhoods based on race, ethnicity or income -- and ensure that less affluent communities had fair access to financial services. Compliance is crucial for banks: Mergers and other regulatory approvals are contingent on it. Currently, banks are required to carry out a certain amount of economic activity -- either lending, philanthropy, or other banking business -- in low-income areas that usually align with their physical locations. But the law has become somewhat outdated in the era of online banking, because banks can attract customers and do business in areas far afield of their branch networks. Years before he was comptroller, Mr. Otting collided with the C.R.A. as chief executive of a California bank called OneWest -- then owned by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. In 2014, OneWest and another bank, CIT, agreed to a $3.4 billion merger. Community groups nearly scuttled the deal by arguing that both banks had dismal records of complying with the reinvestment act. One such group, the Greenlining Institute, alleged that Mr. Otting had created the illusion of grass-roots support for the merger using a form email that could be personalized and sent in with a few clicks. According to the Fed, 2,093 of the 2,177 comments ultimately submitted in favor of the merger were identical form letters.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Regulators approved the merger after both banks pledged to increase their activity in poor communities, but Mr. Otting has said the experience left him with a sour taste. ""I went through a very difficult period with some community groups that didn't support our community, who came in at the bottom of the ninth inning, that tried to change the direction of our merger,"" he said at a banking conference in April 2018, The Wall Street Journal reported. ""And so I have very strong viewpoints."" Even before Mr. Otting arrived in Washington in November 2017, Treasury officials were working on a plan to update the rules. A group of policymakers held more than 90 meetings with banks, community groups and trade organizations to determine the best way to reshape the requirements. They created a blueprint and presented it to Mr. Mnuchin, who signed off and sent it to the White House, and then to regulators.

Mr. Otting decided to do his own research. Last year, he toured multiple cities to talk about the law and listen to community feedback. He wanted to redo the rules based on his experience as a banker, he said, making them clearer and easier to follow. In December, he proposed a sweeping rewrite, and initially secured support from the F.D.I.C. His plan specified which products, services and projects banks could undertake to fulfill their duties and boiled down the evaluation of their work in poor communities to a single metric. But it took away the most important tool that regulators and community groups had to hold banks to account -- the discretion to argue that even if banks' activities looked good on paper, they weren't significant enough to help communities. Officials at the Fed felt that Mr. Otting's proposal was poorly designed and began working on an alternative. When the central bank asked to include its own proposal for comment from stakeholders, Mr. Otting shot the idea down, according to two people familiar with the process. The Fed, led by Chair Jerome H. Powell, decided to let the O.C.C. go its own way. ""We worked to try to get fully aligned with the proposal -- we weren't able to get there,"" Mr. Powell later told lawmakers. ""They weren't able to get to our proposal either."" Negative reaction to the proposal was swift. Representative Maxine Waters, chairwoman of the House Financial Services Committee, called it ""misguided"" and said any changes to the law must not be rushed through. Community groups also attacked the plan, saying it could deprive poor and minority communities of access to credit. Banks, despite wanting a C.R.A. revamp, were also unhappy with Mr. Otting's rewrite. The American Bankers Association, the largest of the bank trade groups, warned against finalizing the rule without extensive improvements, followed by testing of its measurement methods and a pilot program.","Joseph Otting, the top overseer of the country's largest banks, drew from his own experiences as a banker to rewrite rules for the Community Reinvestment Act.

Travel,Restaurant Report: 27 in Miami Beach,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/17/travel/restaurant-report-27-in-miami-beach.html,"New restaurants on and around Ocean Drive in Miami Beach -- usually housed in the latest branded boutique hotel with big-name absentee chefs, high-priced fusion menus and '80s decor -- are a dime a dozen. Then there's 27, a spot that opened in November just a few steps, but a world away, from that touristy, neon-dotted strip.

The difference in setting is immediately obvious: 27 resides in a classic Art Deco landmark built in the 1930s. Inside, instead of cold marble and garish lighting, the interior design firm Roman & Williams has gone in a much more intimate direction with wood floorboards, candlelit tables and low ceilings that run through interlocking rooms; it feels as if you are visiting a private home for a stylish dinner party. On a recent Sunday night every table was taken and the bar was packed, but the vibe was unpretentious, with groups of young Miamians and couples on dates elbow to elbow on banquettes and benches.

The complex also houses the owners' other big project, Freehand Miami: a hot-spot hostel and a craft cocktail bar, the Broken Shaker. Elad Zvi, an owner, conceived of 27 as a place to capitalize on the region's ethnic diaspora.

""We wanted a restaurant that reflected Miami and the people who live here, from the Latin American community to the Jewish,"" he said. ""My partner is Colombian and I am from Israel and we wanted to have that sense of eating at home.""","The restaurant, in an Art Deco building just a few steps away from Ocean Drive, stands out for its unpretentious vibe.",77f9e88c-d74c-502a-9077-305c2ea7b426,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/17/travel/17BITES/17BITES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=09c1fa0fcecebce8f0f2ad43d19d42b95070192fb9bcb47b3089f68fd661ef93&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Miso- and tahini-massaged kale, shaved fennel and crisp chickpeas.",77f9e88c-d74c-502a-9077-305c2ea7b426,N24News/imgs/77f9e88c-d74c-502a-9077-305c2ea7b426.jpg,4
Health,Did Federal Officials Really Question W.H.O. Tests for Coronavirus?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/health/coronavirus-tests-who.html,"At a time when the Trump administration is facing intense criticism for its failure to make coronavirus tests available to millions of nervous Americans, remarks by a federal health official on Tuesday appeared to suggest that the World Health Organization's diagnostic tests were wildly inaccurate. In a somewhat rambling answer to a question related to W.H.O. tests, Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House coronavirus response coordinator, said: ""It doesn't help to put out a test where 50 percent or 47 percent were false positives. Imagine what that would mean to the American people. Imagine what that would mean to tell someone they were positive when they weren't."" It was not clear where Dr. Birx got those figures, but obviously such an inaccurate test would be worthless. Late on Tuesday night, Dr. Birx confirmed that although she was responding to a question about the W.H.O. test, she was referring to a study of an early diagnostic test used in China. The paper found that, in a specific subset of those tested in China -- asymptomatic contacts of known cases -- the tests wrongly found them to be positive 47 percent of the time.

But there have been no suggestions that the W.H.O. test, distributed worldwide, has such significant accuracy problems. On Tuesday night, Dr. Birx said she has not looked into the W.H.O. test, ""but I assume it is functional."" Dr. Birx was asked several questions by reporters about the lack of tests during the news conference, and came and went to the microphone several times. Early on, she was asked a question that the administration has struggled to deal with: If federal officials have shipped millions of tests, as White House officials have said several times, why have only 60,000 Americans been tested? Dr. Birx answered that tests in the United States were now being made by many producers, which is correct. Differing diagnostic tests are now made by state laboratories, medical school laboratories and private companies like Thermo Fisher, which she mentioned as an example. Dr. Birx said she was strongly urging commercial providers to get their tests out, but of course, they first had to prove to the Food and Drug Administration that they were of high quality.

Later, she was asked about a criticism made by former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. in Monday's night's debate. He said the W.H.O. had ""offered tests to the United States but we didn't buy them."" In her answer, she did not refer to the W.H.O. tests at all, but said, ""We don't buy tests that haven't been quality-controlled and they show us the data,"" then adding that a test with high rates of inaccuracy would be a disaster. A spokeswoman for the W.H.O. said she did not know what Dr. Birx was referring to, but the agency had been supplying kits to member nations since January. The accuracy of the test was validated by three laboratories before it was rolled out, the spokeswoman said, and it had consistently showed ""good performance in laboratory and clinical use, and neither a significant number of false positive nor false negative results have been reported.""
* The Australian Open will require players to be fully vaccinated.
* A C.D.C. study finds stillbirths are higher in pregnant women with Covid. In any case, Mr. Biden's assertion that the Trump administration refused tests offered by the W.H.O. appears to be wrong. The W.H.O. does not sell tests to wealthy countries, which usually prefer to make their own. Dr. Anne Schuchat, deputy principal director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, confirmed that the W.H.O. gave test kits ""primarily to underresourced countries."" Another administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, confirmed that the W.H.O. had never offered to sell or give tests to the United States.

China, Hong Kong, France, Germany, Thailand and the United States have all designed their own tests, according to the W.H.O. website. Each one looks for the presence of two or three short stretches of viral genes. For example, the C.D.C's test looks at three targets on the N gene, while the tests ordered by the W.H.O. look at bits of the N gene, the RdRP gene and the E gene. Each gene performs a different function in helping the virus break into cells, hijack their DNA machinery and reproduce million of copies of itself. For countries that are unable to make the tests or buy them from other countries, the W.H.O. asks academic or government laboratories to make tests. It then delivers them to poor and middle-income countries at low or no cost, paying for them out of emergency funds or loans from institutions like the World Bank. The test ordered by the W.H.O. was designed in a lab run by Dr. Christian Drosten at the medical school of Berlin's Charity Hospital, which is considered one of the world's top genomic laboratories.

In a Feb. 21 email, another W.H.O. spokesman said the test's accuracy had been verified by three other laboratories before it was sent to a German diagnostics company for manufacturing. There had been no problems with the first shipment of 250,000 doses, he said. Dr. Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, said both the W.H.O. test and the initial C.D.C. tests were ""exceptional"" in their accuracy. The problems with the C.D.C. test have been attributed to flaws in the manufacturing of reagents for kits, not in the C.D.C.'s design. No test is accurate 100 percent of the time, but the errors are usually introduced by medical personnel who fail to take samples correctly or lab personnel who run the test incorrectly or accidentally contaminate it with stray DNA. For example, in February an American passenger released from the cruise ship Westerdam, which went from port to port for many days before Cambodia allowed it to dock, tested positive for the virus as she passed through Malaysia, setting off a crisis. The C.D.C. later said she did not have the virus and judged the Malaysian test to be a likely false positive. Since Malaysia did not have its own test, it presumably used the W.H.O.'s. But Malaysia does not have a top-quality lab, and many labs make initial errors when they are rolling out a new test. Sheri Fink and Ellen Gabler contributed reporting from New York. Abby Goodnough contributed reporting from Washington.",Dr. Deborah Birx said she did not mean to suggest the widely used diagnostic tests generated frequent false-positive results.,821be57c-4148-5650-99ce-d3451d8dfcd8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/17/science/17VIRUS-TESTS1/17VIRUS-TESTS1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2ff2a6cc11529b3da0963a170be7df3e3d6f80cf497eb23237f34ec5d8c30eeb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House's coronavirus response coordinator, with President Trump and other members of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, at a press briefing on Tuesday.",821be57c-4148-5650-99ce-d3451d8dfcd8,N24News/imgs/821be57c-4148-5650-99ce-d3451d8dfcd8.jpg,1
Science,Exxon Mobil Fights Back at State Inquiries Into Climate Change Research,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/17/science/exxon-mobil-fights-back-at-state-inquiries-into-climate-change-research.html,"In the eight months since the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, announced the first investigation of Exxon Mobil over its past research statements about climate change, nearly 20 other state attorneys general have voiced their support. But Exxon Mobil has increasingly been pushing back, fighting subpoenas in court and winning the support of lawmakers and friendly state attorneys general who have attacked the investigations as flashy political prosecutions dressed up as legal inquiries. The company, for example, filed a motion on Wednesday in federal court in Texas to block a demand for documents by the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, calling it a ""fishing expedition."" The filing argued that Ms. Healey was ""abusing the power of government"" to silence the company, and that she made statements in a March news conference with Mr. Schneiderman and other state law enforcement officials that suggested she had already made up her mind about what her investigation would find.

On Thursday, Exxon Mobil followed up with a petition in state court in Massachusetts asking the court to recuse Ms. Healey's office from pursuing the investigation because ""it is impermissibly biased"" against the company. Exxon Mobil also argued that the state law that Ms. Healey relied in her investigation has only a four-year statute of limitations. Alan T. Jeffers, a spokesman for the company, said, ""The great irony here is that we've acknowledged the risks of climate change for more than a decade, have supported a carbon tax as the better policy option and spent more than $7 billion on research and technologies to reduce emissions."" A spokeswoman for Ms. Healey, Cyndi Roy Gonzalez, said in a statement that Exxon Mobil's legal efforts are ""an unprecedented effort to limit the ability of state attorneys general to investigate fraud and unfair business practices."" The law enforcement officials' actions also have been questioned by Lamar S. Smith of Texas, the Republican chairman of the House Science Committee, and more recently by a coalition of state attorneys general who called the investigations ""a grave mistake"" that ""raises substantial First Amendment concerns.""

Mr. Schneiderman has consistently argued that he is trying to determine whether the company committed fraud by telling investors and consumers one thing while its research showed the opposite. ""The First Amendment does not give any corporation the right to commit fraud,"" said Eric Soufer, a spokesman for the attorney general. Mr. Soufer added, ""Everything we've seen this week is ripped straight from the Big Tobacco playbook: delay, deflect, and distract from any serious investigation into potential fraud or corporate malfeasance."" Mr. Schneiderman has called the pushback from the company and its supporters ""First Amendment opportunism."" State attorneys general have been at odds over many issues, including the Obama administration's Affordable Care Act and Clean Power Plan. But the sniping among conservative and liberal attorneys general has been especially heated over Exxon Mobil. The letter this week from the coalition of conservative state attorneys general, led by Luther Strange of Alabama, stated that Mr. Schneiderman and his allies are ""using law enforcement authority to resolve a public policy debate"" that is not suited to the courts. Exxon Mobil went to court in April to oppose subpoenas issued by Claude E. Walker, the attorney general of the Virgin Islands. The Competitive Enterprise Institute, a libertarian advocacy group that also received a subpoena from Mr. Walker, filed a motion against him under a law limiting malicious or frivolous lawsuits intended to suppress speech. Mr. Walker, who had tried to reassure the group it was not a target, withdrew the subpoena. In a news conference on Thursday, Kent Lassman, the institute's president, said that ""Maura Healey is on a witch hunt"" and Mr. Schneiderman is involved in ""a conspiracy to punish dissent.""

During Exxon Mobil's years of funding organizations that undercut climate science, the Competitive Enterprise Institute received about $2 million from the company and its affiliated foundations, according to records obtained by the Climate Investigations Center. ""The reason C.E.I. is so up in arms about these subpoenas is their fear of revealing their dirty laundry,"" said Kert Davies, the founder of the investigations center, in reference to Competitive Enterprise Institute. Sam Kazman, the general counsel for the institute, said that the organization does not disclose donor information. He called Mr. Davies's suggestions about the group's motives ""whistling in the dark."" While it has fought some investigators fiercely, Exxon Mobil has provided hundreds of thousands of pages of documents in response to Mr. Schneiderman's office. And Robert C. Post, the dean of Yale Law School and a constitutional scholar, rejected the notion that Exxon Mobil is being gagged by the state efforts. ""Debate is not being suppressed in any way by this,"" he said, adding that citing First Amendment rights has become ""a weapon in the arsenal of those who would seek to unravel the regulatory state."" ""They're bringing it up because it sounds good.""","After 20 state attorneys general supported an investigation into the company, Exxon Mobil is using the courts to try and stop the legal momentum.",6e661ada-b5ba-5f43-95f4-5519fa758d98,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/17/us/17EXXON/17EXXON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=e74f1ed60792226f1fe459b91ab631f762182976e3c3f874c3cca6d4b3b9b25a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Exxon Mobil filed a motion on Wednesday to block a request by the Massachusetts attorney general, Maura Healey, center.",6e661ada-b5ba-5f43-95f4-5519fa758d98,N24News/imgs/6e661ada-b5ba-5f43-95f4-5519fa758d98.jpg,2
Travel,Mohonk's Farm-to-Table Rebirth,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/01/travel/farm-to-table-chef-mohonk-hudson-valley-new-york.html,"Credit...Tony Cenicola/The New York Times



Can you create a farm-to-table restaurant if you have 100 tables in an 8,750-square-foot main dining room, 80 more tables downstairs, nine in a cozy lounge, 50 outside overlooking an Arcadian lake and, on certain nights, eight in a capacious kitchen? That is the question that Jim Palmeri, the executive chef at Mohonk Mountain House in New Paltz, N.Y., spent several years contemplating. Mohonk, the idyllic resort founded by Albert Smiley in 1869, was not a logical candidate for a chef-driven restaurant with a focus on local sourcing. It's not a cafe, bistro or gastropub. It's big. The hotel, a National Historic Landmark on more than 2,000 acres in the Shawangunk Mountains, has 265 rooms in five wings that date to 1879.

But there, in the bowls and on the plates, is a bisque made with local parsnips; polenta from Wild Hive Farm in Clinton Corners; cheese from Chaseholm Farm in Pine Plains; and a bounty of vegetables grown throughout the Hudson Valley. On tap there might be an I.P.A. from Arrowood Farms in Accord just down the hill, and mixed into cocktails you might find McKenzie bourbon from Burdett in the Finger Lakes or 46 Peaks vodka from Lake Placid. ""It's funny how things change,"" Mr. Palmeri said early one morning in the Mohonk kitchen, where the staff was already focused on prepping for the lunch and dinner crowds. ""When I first started cooking, everybody wanted the exotic. Ostrich was going to be the next red meat. Now they want to know what you buy locally. They want to know how far the farm is from the hotel."" Mr. Palmeri, 54, has been the executive chef at Mohonk for 10 years, and although he long had an interest in local products, the volume needed at a resort that serves more than 500,000 meals a year was a hurdle. ""In the old days they'd bring us a box of lettuce and half of it was dirt and grubs,"" he said. ""And as nice as that sounds we can't have a guy just cleaning lettuce.""

But new purveyors brought new opportunities to showcase Hudson Valley products, and ""the next challenge for me is to implement more of that into the dining experience."" By training and temperament, Mr. Palmeri is well suited for the job of redefining Mohonk menus. After graduating from the culinary program at Kendall College in Illinois, he worked primarily at large hotels, many with well-regarded restaurants. He was the executive chef at six Hyatt properties, from Coral Gables, Fla., to Grand Cayman Island, and jokes that he and his wife found themselves in balmy locales because of a ""palm tree rule"" they serendipitously ended up following. When he arrived in New Paltz, where the trees lean toward pine and maple, Mr. Palmeri had to ""get my head around"" Mohonk. Unlike resorts and hotels with multiple options -- or proximity to cities with plenty of good restaurants -- Mohonk has one dining room for dinner. (That room, which was first used in 1893, is grand; the ceilings are as high as 23 feet 10 inches.) ""There's no choice for our guests, really,"" he said. ""We have one opportunity, the dinner menu, to make someone from the city feel that they've had a good meal, or someone who wants a steak and potato and that's it.""

Mr. Palmeri's second in command is Steve Anson, the executive sous-chef, who began at Mohonk as a banquet chef, left for several years to be the executive chef at a boutique hotel in Lake George, N.Y., and returned in 2011. Another returning alum is the pastry chef Audrey Billups, who was at Mohonk when Mr. Palmeri began; he helped arrange for her to work at the Addison, the acclaimed restaurant in San Diego (stints at Marea and Ai Fiori in New York City followed). With an expanded team -- there can be as many as 70 staff members during the summer in a kitchen that is quiet only between midnight and 3:30 a.m. -- Mr. Palmeri set about elevating the food. Mohonk began making its own pasta two and a half years ago. It also started smoking brisket, bacon, pork belly and other meats. And Ms. Billups has transformed the desserts: lemon-thyme posset with shortbread, apple brown-sugar cheesecake with apple cider caramel and a dusting of brown butter sugar. But the most significant change has been the profusion of New York State products from suppliers like Farms2Tables, which delivers produce and meats from more than 90 Hudson Valley farmers, and FingerLakes Farms (70 Normandy ducks a week).

""We can get all these things now easily,"" Mr. Palmeri said of the local produce and poultry. ""Before, we were so busy and we were short-staffed, so you had to give your attention to the most pressing thing, which was surviving the day."" (Of course, not everything is local; no one is pulling sea bass and blue cod out of Lake Mohonk.) Last summer, Mohonk introduced a Chef's Table meal in the kitchen, with seating for eight. It is a chance for the chefs to show what they can do but not show off (Mohonk is not braggy): 11 courses, matching wines, spirited group, total fun. On the night I went, the procession included a silky cylinder of Hudson Valley foie gras with compressed apples and plum compote; a poached local egg with hollandaise foam and English muffin crumbles; a smoked sea scallop and velvety Iberico lardo atop potato cream; and a crisp-skinned Finger Lakes duck breast with sherry sauce and duck-confit tortellini. As J. K. Rowling wrote of the dishes that awaited Harry Potter at Hogwarts: ""He had never seen so many things he liked to eat on one table."" And then there were desserts, which included vanilla wafer cones filled with Chambord ice cream made tableside by Mr. Anson, and a showstopper orchestrated by Ms. Billups. After the table was covered with a white plastic mat (""a blank canvas,"" she said), Ms. Billups spooned and scattered the following for each diner (this a partial list but you'll get the picture): hot fudge sauce, pistachio sabayon, an ounce of warm chocolate cake, cubes of amaretto gelee. It was a finger-painting with one burst of flavor -- sweet, tart, tangy -- after another.

Mr. Palmeri's latest project is the rethinking of the Granary, the cliff-top outdoor restaurant. This year, there is flavorful grass-fed beef in the burgers, and savory chicken, both from the region. ""The Granary is outdoor barbecue,"" Mr. Palmeri said. ""It should all be local, right?"" None of this happened overnight, which is in keeping with Mohonk, where it's not supposed to (employees were still harvesting ice from the lake in 1965). One of the hotel's infinite charms is how steadfast it is. There have never been televisions in rooms. A sign tells guests that ""horseplay"" is prohibited at what is still called the bathing beach. Meditation sessions are held every morning. Tea and cookies are served each afternoon in the Lake Lounge. You go back to Mohonk looking forward to doing the things you did the last time: strolling on a trail or scrambling up the rocks to Sky Top Tower, with a sweeping view of the cliff called the Trapps. Finding serenity on a bench in one of the scores of gazebos known as summerhouses (the view from Huntington Lookout is spectacular). Making a paper lantern in an afternoon craft session. Piling into the Parlor after dinner to see the ventriloquist Sylvia Fletcher or to venture an answer in a rock 'n' roll quiz conducted by Bruce Morrow, a.k.a. the longtime D.J. Cousin Brucie. (I won a Gladys Knight & the Pips CD; totally wanted it.) Any changes to the place are deliberated by the Smiley family. The expansive spa, for one, was discussed for a decade before it opened in 2005. As Eric Gullickson, the general manager and a fifth-generation member of the Smiley family, said, it's important that Mohonk is ""not just reacting to something that's a trend."" (""Disruption"" is not in the Mohonk vocabulary.)

The small bar called the Carriage Lounge was a similar story. Albert Smiley, from a temperate Quaker family, did not serve alcohol when he opened Mohonk in what had previously been a 10-room tavern owned by John Stokes, which most definitely did. That didn't mean some guests didn't drink. ""They would bring these suitcase travel bars to their room, and they would try to get enough of a shine on to get them through dinner and sometimes they overshot,"" Mr. Palmeri said. ""The way they judged the captain in the dining room was, was he able to carry a guest back to their room?"" The dining room began serving liquor in 1970. The Carriage Lounge opened in 2005, and Spirits on the Sunset, drinks on a broad porch with the Catskill Mountains as backdrop, in 2016. The emphasis on local food, though, isn't a change as much as it's a back-to-the-garden moment. For decades Mohonk had its own farms -- at one time there were seven -- which provided food for its dining room. (Mohonk Farms Milk was still listed on the menu in 1958.) One farm, Mountain Rest, is now part of the hilly Mohonk golf course, and others, like Home Farm and Spring Farm, have prominent places in the 85-mile Mohonk trail system.

In 1972: sauteed frog legs Provencal, creamed Welsh rabbit on a Holland rusk, and, in a gust of brand names, ""Hollywood Diet Bread"" and ""Steamed Uncle Ben's Rice."" For those interested in how those dishes were prepared, a visit to the museum -- Jim Clark, curator -- is in order.

(""You don't get a milk shake now,"" Mr. Clark said, hitting a Louis C. K. note. ""You get a blend!"") My first visit to Mohonk was in 1987, when my wife and I celebrated our first anniversary on what we remember as a muddy May weekend. Our dinner orders have been lost to time, but we were so taken with the place -- including the warmth of the longleaf-pine-walled main dining room -- that we have returned on a number of occasions with our three children (first as grade-schoolers, then as grown-ups), a grandmother or a passel of friends. Dinner was always dependable and, in recent years, became much more ambitious and delicious. It wasn't a thunderclap; true to Mohonk tradition, Mr. Palmeri plays a long game. (He also knows which flames to keep -- he loves Thanksgiving at Mohonk -- turkey, stuffing, gravy, cranberry sauce. ""It really glows.

Food,"In Six Compartments, All the Flavors of Home",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/dining/bond-sonny-caberwal-spice-tin-rajma.html,"Before Sonny Caberwal left his small hometown -- Asheboro, N.C. -- for college, his mother, aunt and grandmother pulled him into the kitchen. ""I think they thought I was going to starve,"" said Mr. Caberwal, 36, the founder of Bond, a venture that seeks to resurrect the ritual of handwritten correspondence, using robotics. The women taught him to make rajma, his favorite dish, a Punjabi curry of red kidney beans. Then his mother gave him a loondani, a round spice tin of beaten copper, the size of a small kettle. Today it sits, shining and ornate with a Braille of flowers, in the coolly modern kitchen of his apartment in the financial district.

Unlatch the domed lid and you find a shallow tray with a long, dainty spoon for measuring. Below are tucked six canisters of spices, five of them -- loon (salt), jeera (cumin), dhania (coriander), lal mirch (red chile) and amchur (mango powder) -- arranged like petals around haldi (turmeric) at the center. ""You keep all the spices together so there's no rummaging around,"" Mr. Caberwal said.

With this, his mother had equipped him to face the world, even though he was going only an hour away, to attend Duke University in Durham, N.C. In a sense, he wasn't leaving home at all: His family's gurdwara (Sikh temple) was in Durham. There he had helped out in the langar (communal kitchen and canteen), where everyone gathered after services to cook and eat together. The langar meal is free and open to all. ""You don't have to be Sikh,"" he said. ""Everyone sits at the same level and eats the same food.""

He eventually strayed farther, studying law at Georgetown University. He was living across from the Pentagon on Sept. 11. In the aftermath, a number of Sikh Americans were harassed and attacked by people who confused their turbans and beards with the garb of Muslim militants.

""Since I was a kid, people always look at you because you're different,"" Mr. Caberwal said. ""But that's part of being Sikh, to wear the uniform, to look different. ""I'm not the most religious person in the whole world,"" he added. But in 2008, he became an ambassador of sorts for the Sikh faith, appearing in a Kenneth Cole ad campaign with the headline ""We All Walk in Different Shoes.""

The sight of a Sikh man on a billboard, in a turban and rakish sunglasses, was considered radical enough to be front-page news in The Times of India. (Mr. Caberwal had sent in a photograph after the company put out an appeal for a Sikh model.) ""I've always had this idea, how tradition and new things go together,"" Mr. Caberwal said. He briefly played the tabla with the electronic dance band Thievery Corporation and, with his wife, Preeti Bal, a Sikh from Ohio, ran an e-commerce site from a New Delhi office near 13th-century monuments. These days Ms. Bal does most of the cooking, although Mr. Caberwal tries to take over on weekends, recreating his mother's dishes. ""For our kids"" -- a 3-year-old daughter and year-old twin sons -- ""it's important,"" he said. ""We don't have the same grounding in our culture because we were born in the U.S."" On his first date with Ms. Bal, 10 years ago, he cooked dinner. The main course: rajma, whose recipe called for almost every spice in the loondani. ""I said, 'Really?'"" Ms. Bal said with a laugh. ""'You're going to feed a girl beans and rice?'"" It worked.","A loondani, a copper tin given to Sonny Caberwal by his mother, contains the essential spices for homemade rajma.",ede90919-65fa-5e70-a5c0-5351235e2833,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/20/dining/20CLOSE1/20CLOSE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=a992af262fb84d3ab225fec0e61b37ab5619f33b2276b0589bacb2e9f84713b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sonny Caberwal holds the copper spice tin given to him by his mother.,ede90919-65fa-5e70-a5c0-5351235e2833,N24News/imgs/ede90919-65fa-5e70-a5c0-5351235e2833.jpg,17
Economy,$15-an-Hour Minimum Wage in California? Plan Has Some Worried,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/29/business/economy/15-hour-minimum-wage-in-california-plan-has-some-worried.html,"California is on the verge of making itself a guinea pig in a bold economics experiment. By moving toward a plan to raise the statewide minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2022, the state could raise living standards for millions of workers. But it could also increase unemployment among some of the very same economically marginal workers the wage increase is intended to help. Many economists, even some on the left, worry that a potential loss of jobs in a number of cities where wages are comparatively low could largely offset, and perhaps even more than offset, the boon of higher incomes at the bottom of the wage scale. ""Just as the benefits of this policy are likely to be greater because it covers a greater share of the work force than for past minimum wage increases, the risk of these costs is also higher,"" said Ben Zipperer, an expert on the minimum wage at the liberal Washington Center for Equitable Growth. ""It's very unclear how that's going to stack up."" San Francisco and San Jose, both high-wage cities that have benefited from the tech boom, are likely to weather the increase without so much as a ripple. The negative consequences of the minimum wage increase in Los Angeles and San Diego -- large cities where wages are lower -- are likely to be more pronounced, though they could remain modest on balance.

But in lower-wage, inland cities like Bakersfield and Fresno, the effects could play out in much less predictable ways. That's because the rise of the minimum wage to $15 over the next six years would push the wage floor much closer to the expected pay for a worker in the middle of the wage scale, affecting a much higher proportion of employees and employers there than in high-wage cities. ""This is a big experiment,"" said Arindrajit Dube, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst whose work has shown that modest minimum wage increases typically have limited effects on employment. ""In areas like Fresno, a majority of workers are likely to be directly or indirectly affected."" Gov. Jerry Brown, announcing details of the proposed legislation at a news conference on Monday, acknowledged the potential hardships of giving California the highest minimum wage of any state in the country. Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.
* None
* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. ""If you took the wages down and cut them in half, it would make it easier for certain businesses,"" he said. ""But you can't function that way, because we're a community."" Mr. Brown, who worked out the deal with top legislators and labor leaders, said the risks were worth it. ""It's a matter of economic justice,"" he said, ""and it makes sense.""

The legislation would delay by one year the schedule of wage increases for businesses with 25 workers or fewer, and would allow the governor to pause an increase for one year if the economy weakened or the state's budget deteriorated. Craig Scharton, the owner of a farm-to-table restaurant called Peeve's Public House in downtown Fresno, said he was still smarting from a recent increase in the minimum wage from $9 to $10 an hour. He said the increase had forced him to close on Mondays and Tuesdays and played a role in reducing his staffing to a dozen today from 18 two and a half years ago. Mr. Scharton was at a loss to explain how he would absorb the new increase. ""We're trying our best to revitalize downtown,"" he said. ""This just kind of kicks our legs out from under us.""

The Fresno example illustrates the challenge of raising the minimum wage to the same level across cities that, in economic terms, have little in common beyond the same state government. Cities with high real estate prices are typically better able to withstand minimum wage increases than cities with low prices, because wages represent a smaller fraction of a business's overall cost in those cities and therefore have a smaller effect on the bottom line.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. But in Fresno, real estate is cheap and wages are by far the biggest cost for the typical service sector business. Mr. Scharton estimates that labor is about 40 percent of his costs, versus about 6 percent for real estate. Likewise, businesses in cities with large tourist industries often find it easier to pass along higher costs to customers, as tourists tend to be less price-sensitive than locals. But Fresno, unlike Los Angeles or San Francisco, is not a tourist hub.

""I don't think we have anything over $14 for an entree,"" he said. ""We can't do $32 an entree like some high-end fancy New York restaurant."" The adverse effects from a sharp increase in the minimum wage may not be as severe as some opponents fear, however. Michael Reich, an economics professor at the University of California, Berkeley -- whose work policy makers in Los Angeles and New York State have relied on to analyze their recent efforts to raise the minimum wage -- said that, in his models, the overall economic effect of a $15 minimum wage was roughly neutral, even when it amounted to 60 percent of the median wage. The reason, he said, is that the negative economic consequences of a higher wage -- namely, lower employment, partly because of greater automation, and declining sales because of price increases -- were offset by greater purchasing power on the part of workers, which would lift economic activity in an area. As for low-cost cities where the impact could be even larger, Mr. Reich said low-wage workers in places like Fresno were not so differently paid from low-wage workers in higher-cost cities -- despite the fact that typical wages in those cities are far apart. ""Even if the average wage differential between Fresno and the rest of the state is about 25 percent,"" Mr. Reich said, ""just within retail and restaurants you find that the wage differential is more like 5 percent."" Moreover, the benefits of the higher wage may be more than purely economic. Dave Regan is president of SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West, which represents more than 85,000 hospital workers in California and deployed more than 2,500 members to collect hundreds of thousands of signatures to qualify a minimum wage ballot initiative. He said that even if there were potential economic downsides, the effect of empowering workers to influence their own fates could be transformative politically. ""There's so much cynicism, anger,"" Mr. Regan said. ""To have the governor and legislature responding in a positive and constructive way to our members is really important. It shows, 'Wow, what we do really does matter.'""",The move to raise the statewide minimum wage would make California a guinea pig in a bold economic experiment.,3ee34eac-13ac-5ea7-81f5-aebabbf88f55,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/29/business/29DB-WAGE/29DB-WAGE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=25e6d6fddf1c3c38ca9f4297c124e881797bb481dd42f3bbb5dda05c9734e3f7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Skechers center in Moreno Valley, Calif.

Your Money,When Your Home Is a Castle,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/your-money/what-to-know-when-buying-a-castle.html,"Roger Declements likes to build his castles the medieval way. He starts with stone -- up to 1,000 tons of it -- and then constructs two parallel walls. After years of work, sometimes an entire decade, these walls add up to what he considers ""the most advanced, strongest and most comfortable"" abode a person can have. ""If you want a secure home, you build a castle,"" said Mr. Declements, whose company is called Castle Magic. (And he has: five of them so far, in Washington, Utah and Idaho.) Unlike castles built centuries ago, his have insulation, modern plumbing and other such amenities, so that people will want to live in them -- and pay in the neighborhood of $1 million to do so.

""When people build castles in America, they're fantasy structures,"" said John Sexton, an associate professor of English, who focuses on medieval literature at Bridgewater State University in Bridgewater, Mass. ""True castles are defensive structures. They weren't thought of as a comfortable place to live. You're inside of them because there were people outside who wanted you dead."" John Lavender II took the comfort-and-fantasy approach when he built a castle of his own. He put up a simple wood-frame structure and then hauled in hundreds of tons of stone, putting each one in place by hand. Over the past 35 years, he has created an imposing stone redoubt on Lake George in upstate New York. He has particularly fond memories of working with his son on the cottage. ""We stoned that whole place in one summer together, working very hard on it,"" he said. Castle aficionados, particularly those who know a thing or two about the castles that dot the countryside of Europe, scoff at these Americanized versions of ancient European fortresses. Words like ""Disney"" and ""confection"" get bandied about to describe them.

""When we started doing castles four years ago, we started with 20 or 30,"" said Michael Braunholtz, sales director of Prestige Property Group, a realty firm in London. ""We could not believe the number of people who hit our page. It beat chateaus, Monaco, St.-Tropez, Venice by a factor of two. The number of people looking for castles was colossal."" He said his firm sometimes gets as many as 200 requests a week. While castles like Mr. Declements's in the Pacific Northwest can be had for the price of a one-bedroom condo in Manhattan, Mr. Lavender's life's work, known as Highlands Castle, is listed for sale at the royal price of $12.8 million. Mr. Declements said he sold his last castle, on Lake Pend Oreille, Idaho, for about $1 million, which he said was above the value of other homes in the resort area. He is building two new ones now, he said. This not the first castle boom in the United States. In the early 20th century, men like William Randolph Hearst, the newspaper publisher, and Raymond Pitcairn, heir to a glass company fortune, built castles to house their collections of medieval art and tapestries. ""A lot of monuments in Europe were in ruins and easily exported, because there were no export duties,"" said Martha Easton, assistant professor of art history and museum professions at Seton Hall University in South Orange, N.J. ""They wanted to put them in medieval castles, not any old house.""

Professor Easton's research focuses on Hammond Castle in Gloucester, Mass., which was built by John Hays Hammond Jr. He invented radio-controlled torpedoes but was fascinated by the past, she said. These 20th-century builders weren't always faithful to history. Hammond Castle has a great hall that evokes the interior of a medieval church and stained glass in the windows, but it also has grand fireplaces, which would have been out of place, and a courtyard leading to a swimming pool, Professor Easton said. Many of the grandest castles from the first boom have become museums: Hearst Castle, which is south of San Francisco; Mr. Pitcairn's Glencairn, outside Philadelphia; and Hammond Castle. Gillette Castle in East Haddam, Conn., was built by an actor famous for playing Sherlock Holmes. But there are smaller relics from that time that persist as homes. They're just not all that conducive for living in the modern world, or easy to remodel. Maria Barr, a Realtor at Select Sotheby's International Realty, is trying to sell an 8,600-square-foot castle in downtown Albany. It was built in the late 1800s and has ivy crawling up its stone turret.

On the plus side, that much space goes for just under $800,000 -- but there are drawbacks. For instance, there is just one full bathroom in the four-floor castle. ""This isn't a house where you could move into,"" Ms. Barr said. ""The kitchens and bathroom are really rudimentary. Anyone who buys it is going to have to add more bathrooms."" For many buyers of existing castles, they are projects. Tom Vozzella, a Realtor with Berkshire Hathaway Real Estate in Stamford, Conn., spent three years trying to sell a castle in the wooded, northern part of the city. The castle was built by Gustave E. Steinback, an early-20th-century architect, on the highest point of his 79-acre property. That was in 1906. In the intervening years, the castle had its ups and downs, and it was in need of serious renovations when it went on the market in 2011 for just over $1 million. ""Functionally, it was a bit obsolete, as most of these castles are,"" Mr. Vozzella said. ""The kitchen was in the basement, and they had a dumbwaiter. Then they took a library and built a kitchen on the main floor. But there wasn't even a bathroom there.""

High-end castles in Europe, with their Old World splendor, aren't any easier to sell. Mr. Braunholtz said his firm has sold only a few castles, despite the hundreds of thousands of people who look at the listings online. ""The size, scale, price and the amount of money you'd need to maintain it removes a large part of the market,"" he said. ""You're down to the top 2 percent. Of those people, most would rather have a luxury ski chalet or a property with sea views in St.-Tropez."" He said one of the hardest parts of selling a castle is weeding out the people who couldn't possibly afford one. Listing a castle ""brings in all these Disney, neo-Arthurian fantasy connotations that we don't want,"" Mr. Braunholtz said. ""I have other properties that you could call a castle, but I wouldn't call it a castle because it puts off real buyers."" He added, ""I'm not saying the word 'castle' is a poisoned chalice, but it makes it tough."" Maintaining an old or a new castle is not cheap. Monique Pignet and her husband bought the Chateau de Moh, a 15th-century number in the Loire Valley of France, eight years ago for 1.6 million euros, or about $2.1 million at the time. It has eight bedrooms, eight baths, a wine cellar, several kitchens and a beautiful view of the wine region.

Ms. Pignet and her husband spent seven years and double the purchase price renovating it. ""What we want now is to earn money from renting it to maintain it,"" she said. ""This is the only way to own a castle, because nowadays you don't have servants. When you live in a castle you need a lot of people. You can't clean it yourself -- it's too huge."" George Appling, the president and co-founder of Boomcloud 360, an audio technology company, fulfilled a childhood dream when he built a castle in McDade, Tex., about 35 miles outside Austin.

The castle cost him about $450,000 to build, but he spends about $40,000 a year on upkeep. ""We have a full-time builder out there always doing something,"" Mr. Appling said. ""Castles are expensive to maintain. That's not surprising, but that's a downside."" He offsets some of the costs through the Sherwood Forest Faire, a medieval village and Renaissance fair he created. Mr. Declements, who has spent his career building castles the old way, warns would-be lords and ladies to choose their manors wisely. ""You want to build it in an area with high-value homes,"" he said. ""In a lower-market area, you're going to take a loss.""",Thinking of buying a castle?

Economy,How the Jobs Report Comes Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/03/business/economy/jobs-report.html,"The monthly jobs figures are a best estimate given the available tools but subject to ambiguity, misinterpretation and error.





The jobs report -- a monthly scorecard for the United States' labor market -- can ignite presidential tweets, flashing news alerts, and stock market jumps or tumbles. Its estimates of how many people are working (or not) are often interpreted as a key indicator of the economy's direction. Of course, no single report can encapsulate something as sprawling and enormous as the United States economy. But the jobs report -- which the Labor Department appropriately titles ""The Employment Situation"" -- is one of the better measures of the labor market and, by extension, the economy's health. It is also one of the broadest, focusing on working families and households.

The report is based on two separate government surveys that are conducted every month. Like all statistical measurements, the figures can be both honest and imprecise -- a best estimate given the available tools but nonetheless subject to ambiguity, misinterpretation, error and anomalies that need to be ignored. It's important to keep in mind that every monthly jobs report provides only a temporary and incomplete snapshot of the economy.

Here's your primer on the report, where the numbers come from and what they mean. Employed: Someone with a job. In general, anyone who reports working for pay -- even just an hour -- during the survey week is considered employed. Nearly 157 million people are counted as employed. Unemployed: Anyone without a job who actively looked for work (sending out resumes, responding to help-wanted ads) during the previous four weeks, regardless of any government benefits received, is considered unemployed. Labor force: The combination of people working and those who are unemployed, available and actively looking for a job. In recent months, the size of the labor force has hovered around 163 million. Not in the labor force: People who are unemployed and not actively looking for work. This group includes people who don't want to be in the labor force, such as millions of college students, parents happy to stay home with their children and millions of retirees. It also includes people who want to work but are not job hunting, like a former steelworker who, after years of fruitless searching, has given up looking but would take a job if he could find one at an acceptable wage. Official unemployment rate: The share of the labor force that is unemployed. The monthly average over the past 12 months has been below 4 percent , a historically low figure.

Labor force participation rate: The percentage of the population 16 years and older that is either working or actively seeking work. The figure is important because it represents how many more workers are available to produce additional goods and services. It also reflects the health of the economy. When people in their prime working years -- mid-20s through mid-50s -- are out of the labor force, it suggests that they don't see opportunities. This rate has still not returned to its prerecession levels.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Employment-population ratio: The percentage of the population 16 years and older that is working. This figure is a useful measure because it takes into account both the labor force participation rate and unemployment, and is easily compared over time. How are the data collected ? The monthly employment report is derived from two separate government surveys that serve different purposes. The estimates in each report are revised twice more after their initial release. Collected by the Census Bureau since 1942, this survey enables the government to estimate the number of people who are employed and calculate the unemployment rate. It is based on the Current Population Survey, conducted each month among 60,000 households, or about 110,000 individuals from around the country. Here's a question that might be asked: Some people work part time because they cannot find full-time work or because business is poor. Others work part time because of family obligations or other personal reasons. What is your main reason for working part time? This is based on data gathered each month from 146,000 private business and government agencies covering about 623,000 work sites. Called the Current Employment Statistics program, it is intended to measure changes in jobs created and lost over time.



Conducted by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, it focuses solely on jobs, rather than on individuals. Thus, a single person working two jobs would be counted once by the household survey (one individual is employed) and twice by the payroll survey (two jobs exist). Which survey provides the better data? The survey of employers, started in a bare-bones form more than a century ago, is considered a more reliable measure than the household survey, in part because the sample is much larger. But it does not pick up all the types of jobs (the self-employed, unpaid family workers, domestic help and agricultural workers) or answer questions about workers' race, ethnicity, age and educational level. The household survey helps fill in those gaps. As a general rule, the monthly numbers are seasonally adjusted. That means the effects of predictable seasonal events like weather changes, major holidays and school schedules are removed (through a statistical technique) so that cyclical, underlying trends can be better observed.","The figures may change from month to month, but the way the Labor Department compiles its employment data does not.",f1abb4a7-d8f5-5ccb-9cb1-7699186efc53,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/07/business/07jobsexplained1/07jobsexplained1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=fba71d57ee57bcbe605cd406b61ceacde85d1757f7b1adb48f61663f94da1a44&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The monthly jobs figures are a best estimate given the available tools but subject to ambiguity, misinterpretation and error.<br /><br />",f1abb4a7-d8f5-5ccb-9cb1-7699186efc53,N24News/imgs/f1abb4a7-d8f5-5ccb-9cb1-7699186efc53.jpg,8
Media,"Despite Sales, 'Harry Potter and the Cursed Child' Isn't Magical to Some Fans",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/business/media/despite-sales-cursed-child-isnt-magical-to-some-potter-fans.html,"Scholastic had high expectations for ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,"" which arrived on July 31 with an enormous first printing of 4.5 million copies.

The publisher's optimism was well warranted, it seems. The play has become an overnight blockbuster, selling more than two million hardcover copies in the first 48 hours, Scholastic said on Wednesday, calling the sales ""unprecedented for a script book.""

More than 5,000 bookstores and libraries around the country celebrated the publication of ""Cursed Child"" with release parties over the weekend.

The play, which is being billed as the eighth book in the Harry Potter series, is a continuation of the story, but also with a stark departure in style and form. It was written by the playwright Jack Thorne, with input from the creator of the series, J. K. Rowling, and the play's director, John Tiffany. The plot unfolds 19 years after the Battle of Hogwarts, when an adult Harry Potter, now a father and a civil servant working at the Ministry of Magic, sees his own children off to Hogwarts.","For Scholastic, ""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"" delivered blockbuster sales.

Opinion,Your Climate Disaster Tax Bill Is Growing,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/opinion/climate-change-financial-disaster.html,"The coronavirus crisis has forced the federal government to step up suddenly with fiscal stimulus to sustain the U.S. economy and help avoid a global depression. This necessary intervention comes at a price -- a spike in federal debt that will need to be repaid over the long term. The resulting pressure on the government, U.S. taxpayers and the broader economy will intersect with another major fiscal challenge, one that we have yet to reckon with: climate change. Even before the coronavirus pandemic struck, the federal government's spending on climate-related disaster recovery was a rapidly rising fiscal threat. In response to climate-related disasters in 2017, for example, Congress appropriated $136 billion in additional funding for recovery -- amounting to about $1,000 for every American taxpayer. The government faces wide exposure, including repairing damage to federal property and lands, federal insurance for property and crops, the cost of making public infrastructure resilient to climate impacts, and disaster aid (including relocation of entire populations in harm's way of persistent climate repercussions like sea level rise). Fourteen billion-dollar weather and climate calamities struck last year, the fifth year in a row with 10 or more. And projections don't look good.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration estimates that the average annual number of disasters causing over $1 billion in damages over the past five years was double the average over the past four decades. The agency warned last year, ""The number and cost of disasters are increasing over time due to a combination of increased exposure, vulnerability, and the fact that climate change is increasing the frequency of some types of extremes that lead to billion-dollar disasters."" Overall, according to the government's national climate assessment in 2018, continued warming ""is expected to cause substantial net damage to the U.S. economy throughout this century, especially in the absence of increased adaptation efforts."" BlackRock, the global investment management firm, calculates a 275 percent increase in major hurricane risk by 2050 under a ""no climate action"" scenario that assumes the continued use of fossil fuels. In California, devastating wildfires forced the utility PG&E to declare bankruptcy last year when its insurance policy of $1.4 billion paled in comparison with damages of $30 billion.

In Sept. 2020, Michael Benson studied detailed satellite imagery. Here's the earth that he saw -- and the one he wants to see. The federal government will bear an increasing share of these losses as private insurance declines to provide coverage for flood- and wildfire-prone property. U.S. coastal real estate properties have been likened to junk bonds -- ""something that will probably go up in value, but has a small to moderate chance of going to zero,"" as the Bloomberg opinion columnist Noah Smith put it.

Gia Kourlas, who reviewed this year's Joyce Ballet Festival in The New York Times, wrote that of 21 dances presented by five companies, only Ms. Bond's ""Then and Again"" stood out.

""Both delicate and forthright, 'Then and Again' is strengthened by Ms. Bond's focus on the women,"" Ms. Kourlas wrote.

Art & Design,38 Art Exhibitions to View in N.Y.C. This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/arts/design/nyc-this-weekend-art-and-museums.html," 'APOLLO'S MUSE: THE MOON IN THE AGE OF PHOTOGRAPHY' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 22). This exhibition is a journey through an uncommon history, that of representations of the moon across four centuries. An outsize and beautifully installed revelation of persistent astronomical searches, it is a trailblazing marriage of science and art -- 300 images and objects (a telescope, a photograph used as a fire screen, two moon globes, Hasselblad cameras used by astronauts), plus film excerpts. The images shine a bright light on astronomers' unstoppable pursuit of knowledge as well as on technological advances, artistic responses and fantasy, and also a generous serving of unabashed cuteness. The show amounts to a testament to the human drive to know and explore, and it quietly affirms the growing influence of visual representations of the moon from the invention of the telescope through the Apollo 11 moon landing 50 years ago.

212-535-7100, metmuseum.org 'ARTISTIC LICENSE: SIX TAKES ON THE GUGGENHEIM COLLECTION' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through Jan. 12). Displays that artists select from a museum's collection are almost inevitably interesting, revealing and valuable. After all, artists can be especially discerning regarding work not their own. Here, six artists -- Cai Guo-Qiang, Paul Chan, Richard Prince, Julie Mehretu, Carrie Mae Weems and Jenny Holzer -- guided by specific themes, have chosen, which multiplies the impact accordingly. With one per ramp, each selection turns the museum inside out. The combination sustains multiple visits; the concept should be applied regularly. (Roberta Smith) 

212-423-3840, guggenheim.org 'AUSCHWITZ. NOT LONG AGO. NOT FAR AWAY' at the Museum of Jewish Heritage (through Jan. 3). Killing as a communal business, made widely lucrative by the Third Reich, permeates this traveling exhibition about the largest German death camp, Auschwitz, whose yawning gatehouse, with its converging rail tracks, has become emblematic of the Holocaust. Well timed, during a worldwide surge of anti-Semitism, the harrowing installation strives, successfully, for fresh relevance. The exhibition illuminates the topography of evil, the deliberate designing of a hell on earth by fanatical racists and compliant architects and provisioners, while also highlighting the strenuous struggle for survival in a place where, as Primo Levi learned, ""there is no why."" (Ralph Blumenthal) 

646-437-4202, mjhnyc.org 'BRAZILIAN MODERN: THE LIVING ART OF ROBERTO BURLE MARX' at the New York Botanical Garden (through Sept. 29). The garden's largest-ever botanical exhibition pays tribute to Brazil's most renowned landscape architect with lush palm trees and vivid plants, along with a display of paintings and tapestries. In the late 1960s and early '70s, Marx (1909-94) planted bright bands of monochrome plants along Rio's Copacabana Beach and the fresh ministries of Brasilia, then the new capital. For this show, the garden and its greenhouses synthesize his achievements into a free-form paean rich with Brazilian species, some of which he discovered himself. (Alcantarea burle-marxii, one of many thick-fronded bromeliads here, has leaves as tall as a 10-year-old.) Check the weather, make sure it's sunny, then spend all day breathing in this exuberant gust of tropical modernism. (Jason Farago)

'CAMP: NOTES ON FASHION' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Sept. 8). Inspired by Susan Sontag's famous 1964 essay, ""Notes on 'Camp,'"" the latest spectacular from the Met's Costume Institute attempts to define this elastic, constantly evolving concept, which leaves taste, seriousness and heteronormativity in the dust. The show researches camp's emergence in 18th-century France and 19th-century England, examines ""Sontagian Camp"" and culminates in an immense gallery of designer confectionaries from the 1980s to now that calls to mind a big, shiny Christmas tree barricaded with presents. (Smith) 

212-535-7100, metmuseum.org 'T.C. CANNON: AT THE EDGE OF AMERICA' at the National Museum of the American Indian (through Sept. 16). In 31 years, Cannon made more stunning artworks than some artists make in much longer lifetimes. This retrospective brings together his polychromatic paintings of Native Americans, intimate drawings commenting on the country's violent history, and original poetry, folk songs and letters to emphasize the full breadth of his singularly hybrid vision. That he made so much mature work in so many mediums before dying in a car accident in 1978 is all the more remarkable. In Cannon's most powerful works, he brings Modernist styles -- most notably Post-Impressionism and Fauvism -- to bear on portraits of Native Americans. There are echoes of Matisse in his ambush of colors and patterns, and shades of van Gogh in his animation of the landscape. But paintings like ""Two Guns Arikara"" (1974-77) and ""Indian With Beaded Headdress"" (1978) demonstrate his irrefutable originality. (Jillian Steinhauer)

americanindian.si.edu 'LEONARD COHEN: A CRACK IN EVERYTHING' at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 8). The curators of this show, John Zeppetelli of the Musee d'Art Contemporain de Montreal and Victor Shiffman, commissioned artists of various disciplines to develop pieces inspired by Cohen. Some are simple and quiet, like ""Ear on a Worm"" from the film artist Tacita Dean, a small image playing on a loop high in the space that shows a perched bird, a reference to ""Bird on the Wire"" from Cohen's 1969 album ""Songs From a Room."" Some are closer to traditional documentary, like George Fok's ""Passing Through,"" which intercuts performances by Cohen throughout his career with video that surrounds the viewer, suggesting the songs are constant and eternal while the performer's body changes with time. Taken together, the layered work on display has a lot to offer on Cohen, but even more to say about how we respond to music, bring it into our lives, and use it as both a balm and an agent for transformation. (Mark Richardson) 

212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org 'CULTURE AND THE PEOPLE: EL MUSEO DEL BARRIO, 1969-2019' at El Museo del Barrio (through Sept. 29). This golden anniversary survey of wonderful art from the collection of a treasured East Harlem-based institution sounds a political note from the start, with works by figures who were crucial to the museum's earliest years, like the street photographer Hiram Maristany and the great printmaker Rafael Tufino. Throughout the show, whether in abstract paintings or sculptural installations, art and activism blend. And there's joy: A 2006 collage called ""Barrio Boogie Movement"" by Rodriguez Calero generates the elation of the sidewalk it depicts, and Freddy Rodriguez's homage to the Dominican catcher Tony Pena -- a gold-leaf baseball nestled in a mink-lined glove -- is a rush of pure fan love. (Holland Cotter) 

212-831-7272, elmuseo.org 'CYCLING IN THE CITY: A 200-YEAR HISTORY' at the Museum of the City of New York (through Oct. 6). The complex past, present and future roles of the bicycle as a vehicle for both social progress and strife are explored in this exhibition. With more than 150 objects -- including 14 bicycles and vintage cycling apparel -- it traces the transformation of cycling's significance from a form of democratized transportation, which gave women and immigrants a sense of freedom, to a political football that continues to pit the city's more than 800,000 cyclists against their detractors today.

'LEONARDO DA VINCI'S ""SAINT JEROME""' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 6). The 500th anniversary of da Vinci's death in 1519 will bring big doings to Paris this fall with a one-stop-only career survey at the Louvre. New York gets a shot of buzz in advance with the appearance at the Met of a single great painting: ""Saint Jerome Praying in the Wilderness."" On loan from the Vatican Museums, it's one of the most rawly expressive images in the da Vinci canon. And it's a mystery. We don't know exactly when it was painted, or for whom, or why. Like much of this artist's work, it's unfinished. Incompleteness is part of its power. And powerful this picture is, a spiritual meltdown unfolding right before your eyes. You won't want to miss it. (Cotter) 

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'DRAWING THE CURTAIN: MAURICE SENDAK'S DESIGNS FOR OPERA AND BALLET' at the Morgan Library & Museum (through Oct. 6). Drawn from Sendak's bequest to the Morgan of his theatrical drawings, this succinct yet bountiful exhibition offers an overview of a dense, underappreciated period in this artist's career, undertaken with his most celebrated books well in the past and his life in uneasy transition. ""Fifty,"" Sendak said, ""is a good time to either change careers or have a nervous breakdown."" The new midlife career he took on in the late 1970s was that of a designer for music theater. His rare ability to convey the light in darkness and the darkness in light brought him to opera. It's the focus of this show, which is aimed at adults but likely delightful for children, too. Five of his productions emerge before our eyes -- from rough sketches to storyboards, polished designs and a bit of video footage -- in those unmistakably Sendakian colors, watery and vivid at once. (Zachary Woolfe) 

212-685-0008, themorgan.org 'THE JIM HENSON EXHIBITION' at the Museum of the Moving Image (ongoing). The rainbow connection has been established in Astoria, Queens, where this museum has opened a new permanent wing devoted to the career of America's great puppeteer, who was born in Mississippi in 1936 and died, too young, in 1990. Henson began presenting the short TV program ""Sam and Friends"" before he was out of his teens; one of its characters, the soft-faced Kermit, was fashioned from his mother's old coat and would not mature into a frog for more than a decade. The influence of early variety television, with its succession of skits and songs, runs through ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" though Henson also spent the late 1960s crafting peace-and-love documentaries and prototyping a psychedelic nightclub. Young visitors will delight in seeing Big Bird, Elmo, Miss Piggy and the Swedish Chef; adults can dig deep into sketches and storyboards and rediscover some old friends. (Jason Farago) 

718-784-0077, movingimage.us 'ILLUSTRATING BATMAN: EIGHTY YEARS OF COMICS AND POP CULTURE' at the Society of Illustrators (through Oct. 12). Batman turned 80 in April, and now the character is being celebrated with this visual feast of covers and interior pages, teeming with vintage and modern original comic art that shows the hero's evolution. The exhibition includes ""Bat-Manga!: The Secret History of Batman in Japan,"" a display devoted to a Batman story originally printed in Japan, and ""Batman Collected: Chip Kidd's Batman Obsession,"" featuring memorabilia belonging to the graphic designer Chip Kidd. (George Gene Gustines) 

212-838-2560, societyillustrators.org [Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] 'ALICJA KWADE: PARAPIVOT' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 27). This shrewd and scientifically inclined artist, born in Poland and based in Berlin, has delivered the best edition in five years of the Met's hit-or-miss rooftop sculpture commission. Two tall armatures of interlocking steel rectangles, the taller of them rising more than 18 feet, support heavy orbs of different-colored marble; some of the balls perch precariously on the steel frames, while others, head-scratchingly, are squinched between them. Walk around these astral abstractions and the frames seem to become quotation marks for the transformed skyline of Midtown; the marbles might be planets, each just as precarious as the one from which they've been quarried. (Farago) 

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'SIMONE LEIGH: LOOPHOLE OF RETREAT' at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (through Oct. 27). Leigh's sensuous, majestic sculptures of black female figures fuse the language of African village architecture and African-American folk art, and sometimes racial stereotypes, like the ""mammy"" figurines produced and collected in earlier eras in America. Sculpture is only one part of the practice that earned Leigh the Hugo Boss Prize 2018, but it is the one that inspired this show of three large objects in a gallery off the rotunda. The title comes from the writings of Harriet Jacobs, an enslaved woman who spent seven years hiding in a crawl space to escape her master's advances. In the exhibition, the ""loophole"" becomes a kind of artistic conceit, too, in which Leigh moves deftly between mediums, styles and messages, addressing multiple audiences -- but always, as she has stated, black women. For Leigh, loopholes might include representations of women that link back to ancestors or empower women by drawing on the freedom available through art. In that sense, these sculptures are sentinels, and placeholders. (Martha Schwendener)

'NOBODY PROMISED YOU TOMORROW: 50 YEARS AFTER STONEWALL' at the Brooklyn Museum (through Dec. 8). In this large group show, 28 young queer and transgender artists, most born after 1980, carry the buzz of Stonewall resistance into the present. Historical heroes, including Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, are honored (in a film by Sasha Wortzel and Tourmaline). Friends in life, Johnson and Rivera are tutelary spirits of an exhibition in which a trans presence, long marginalized by mainstream gay politics, is pronounced in the work of Juliana Huxtable, Hugo Gyrl, Amaryllis DeJesus Moleski and Elle Perez (who is also in the current Whitney Biennial). (Cotter) 

718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org 'OCEAN WONDERS: SHARKS!' at the New York Aquarium (ongoing). For years, the aquarium's 14-acre campus hunkered behind a wall, turning its back to the beach. When aquarium officials last year finally got around to completing the long-promised building that houses this shark exhibition, maybe the biggest move, architecturally speaking, was breaking through that wall. The overall effect makes the aquarium more of a visible, welcoming presence along the boardwalk. Inside, ""Ocean Wonders"" features 115 species sharing 784,000 gallons of water. It stresses timely eco-consciousness, introducing visitors to shark habitats, explaining how critical sharks are to the ocean's food chains and ecologies, debunking myths about the danger sharks pose to people while documenting the threats people pose to sharks via overfishing and pollution. The narrow, snaking layout suggests an underwater landscape carved by water. Past the exit, an outdoor ramp inclines visitors toward the roof of the building, where the Atlantic Ocean suddenly spreads out below. You can see Luna Park in one direction, Brighton Beach in the other. The architectural point becomes clear: Sharks aren't just movie stars and aquarium attractions. They're also our neighbors -- as much a part of Coney Island as the roller coasters and summer dreams. (Michael Kimmelman) 

718-265-3474, nyaquarium.com 'PHENOMENAL NATURE: MRINALINI MUKHERJEE' at the Met Breuer (through Sept. 29). You almost forget that art has the power to startle -- to make you wonder ""How on earth did someone even think to do this, never mind do it?"" -- until you see a show like this survey of sculptures by Mukherjee (1949-2015), an Indian artist. Roughly half are figurelike forms made from hemp rope ropes worked in a knotted macrame technique of finger-aching ingenuity and titled with generic names of pre-Hindu nature spirits and fertility deities. Smaller, ceramic pieces, flamed shaped and midnight black, suggest Buddhas. Late cast bronze sculptures look both botanical and bestial. The result isn't folk art or design or fiber art or religious art or feminist art. It's modern art of deep originality. And it's an astonishment. (Cotter)

'PLAY IT LOUD: INSTRUMENTS OF ROCK & ROLL' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (through Oct. 1). Presented in collaboration with the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, this exhibition offers a vision of history in which the rock music that flowered in the 1960s and '70s sits firmly at the center. The format of the rock band provides the structure of the show, with one room given over to the rhythm section and another showcasing ""Guitar Gods."" Yet another room has a display highlighting the guitar's destruction, with pieces of instruments trashed by Kurt Cobain and Pete Townshend. To the extent that it shifts focus toward the tools of the rock trade, the show is illuminating. Of particular interest is the room set aside for ""Creating a Sound,"" which focuses on the sonic possibility of electronics. The lighting in ""Play It Loud"" is dim, perhaps reflecting rock music as the sound of the night. Each individual instrument shines like a beacon, as if it's catching the glint of an onstage spotlight. It makes the space between audience member and musician seem vast, but that doesn't diminish the wonder of browsing the tools once used by pop royalty. (Richardson) 

212-535-7710, metmuseum.org 'CHARLOTTE POSENENSKE: WORK IN PROGRESS' at Dia Art Foundation in Beacon, N.Y. (through Sept. 9). This Hudson Valley institution continues its satisfying enlargement of its roll call of Miminalists and Conceptualists with a major showcase of this German artist, who showed her modular, industrially inspired sculptures alongside Donald Judd and Frank Stella in the late 1960s, but then abandoned art for sociology. Posenenske's most important works were free-standing pipes, made of sheet steel or cardboard, that look almost exactly like commercial air ducts. Unlike some of the control freaks whose art is also on view here, Posenenske made her art in infinite editions, out of parts that can be arranged in any shape you like: a generous distribution of authorship from the artist to her fabricators and collectors. (Farago) 

diaart.org 'PUNK LUST: RAW PROVOCATION 1971-1985' at the Museum of Sex (through Nov. 30). This show begins with imagery from the Velvet Underground: The 1963 paperback of that title, an exploration of what was then called deviant sexual behavior and gave the band its name, is one of the first objects on display. Working through photos, album art and fliers by artists like Iggy Pop, the New York Dolls, Patti Smith and, yes, the Sex Pistols, the exhibition demonstrates how punk offered a space for sexual expression outside the mainstream. In the story told by ""Punk Lust,"" much of it laid out in placards by the writer and musician Vivien Goldman, one of the show's curators, graphic sexual imagery is a tool for shock that frightens away the straight world and offers comfort to those who remain inside. While some of the power dynamic is typical -- underage groupies cavorting with rock stars -- images from female, queer and nonbinary artists like Jayne County and the Slits make a strong case for sex as an essential source of punk liberation. (Richardson) 

212-689-6337, museumofsex.com 'SCENES FROM THE COLLECTION' at the Jewish Museum (ongoing). After a surgical renovation to its grand pile on Fifth Avenue, the Jewish Museum has reopened its third-floor galleries with a rethought, refreshed display of its permanent collection, which intermingles 4,000 years of Judaica with modern and contemporary art by Jews and gentiles alike -- Mark Rothko, Lee Krasner, Nan Goldin, Cindy Sherman and the excellent young Nigerian draftswoman Ruby Onyinyechi Amanze. The works are shown in a nimble, nonchronological suite of galleries, and some of its century-spanning juxtapositions are bracing; others feel reductive, even dilettantish. But always, the Jewish Museum conceives of art and religion as interlocking elements of a story of civilization, commendably open to new influences and new interpretations. (Farago)

 212-423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org STATUE OF LIBERTY MUSEUM on Liberty Island (ongoing). Security concerns stemming from the Sept. 11 attacks led the National Park Service to restrict the number of people who could go inside the Statue of Liberty's massive stone pedestal and up to the crown. So the Statue of Liberty-Ellis Island Foundation wanted to offer something more for visitors who found the outdoor view less than satisfying: a stand-alone museum on the island that would welcome everyone who wanted to hear the story behind Lady Liberty. Going beyond the vague and often dubious ideal of American ""liberty,"" the museum's displays highlight the doubts of black Americans and women who saw their personal liberties compromised on a daily basis in the 1880s, when the statue opened. These exhibits also spotlight a bit of history that is often forgotten: that the French creators intended the statue as a commemoration of the abolition of slavery in the United States.

One is devoted to relics of L.G.B.T.Q. night life, from the 1950s lesbian bar called the Sea Colony to gay male sex clubs like the Anvil and the Ramrod that sizzled in the 1970s. Another documents the founding in 1974 -- by Joan Nestle, Deborah Edel, Sahli Cavallero, Pamela Olin and Julia Stanley -- of a compendious and still-growing register of lesbian culture called the Herstory Archives. And a third turns a solo spotlight on charismatic individuals: Storme DeLarverie (1920-2014), Mother Flawless Sabrina/Jack Doroshow (1939-2017), Keith Haring (1958-90) and Rollerena Fairy Godmother.

'T. REX: THE ULTIMATE PREDATOR' at the American Museum of Natural History (through Aug. 9, 2020). Everyone's favorite 18,000-pound prehistoric killer gets the star treatment in this eye-opening exhibition, which presents the latest scientific research on T. rex and also introduces many other tyrannosaurs, some discovered only this century in China and Mongolia. T. rex evolved mainly during the Cretaceous period to have keen eyes, spindly arms and massive conical teeth, which packed a punch that has never been matched by any other creature; the dinosaur could even swallow whole bones, as affirmed here by a kid-friendly display of fossilized excrement. The show mixes 66-million-year-old teeth with the latest 3-D prints of dino bones, and also presents new models of T. rex as a baby, a juvenile and a full-grown annihilator. Turns out this most savage beast was covered with -- believe it! -- a soft coat of beige or white feathers. (Farago)

""I am large, I contain multitudes,"" Whitman wrote in ""Song of Myself."" And this summer, New York has been hosting an unusually large and varied selection of artifacts of its most celebrated literary son in honor of his bicentennial birthday, which was on May 31. The public library's exhibition surveys the landmarks of the poet's public career, drawing in large part from its rich holdings. The one at the Morgan features objects from its collection, too, alongside loans from the Library of Congress, including an errant 19th-century butterfly with a back story as colorful as its wings.

212-685-0008, themorgan.org '2019 WHITNEY BIENNIAL' at the Whitney Museum of American Art (through Sept. 22). Given the political tensions that have sent spasms through the nation over the past two years, you might have expected -- hoped -- that this year's biennial would be one big, sharp Occupy-style yawp. It isn't. Politics are present but, with a few notable exceptions, murmured, coded, stitched into the weave of fastidiously form-conscious, labor-intensive work. As a result, the exhibition, organized by two young Whitney curators, Rujeko Hockley and Jane Panetta, gives the initial impression of being a well-groomed group show rather than a statement of resistance. But once you start looking closely, the impression changes artist by artist, piece by piece -- there's quiet agitation in the air. (Cotter) 

212-570-3600, whitney.org 'VIOLET HOLDINGS: LGBTQ+ HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE N.Y.U. SPECIAL COLLECTIONS' at Bobst Library (through Dec. 31). With the Stonewall Inn now a National Historic Landmark (and a bar again; it was a bagel shop in the 1980s), nearby New York University has produced a homegrown archival exhibition at Bobst Library, across the park from Grey Art Gallery. Organized by Hugh Ryan, it takes the local history of queer identity back to the 19th century with documents on Elizabeth Robins (1862-1952), an American actor, suffragist and friend of Virginia Woolf, and forward with ephemera related to the musician and drag king Johnny Science (1955-2007) and the African-American D.J. Larry Levan (1954-92), who, in the 1980s, presided, godlike, at a gay disco called the Paradise Garage, which was a short walk from the campus. (Cotter) 

212-998-2500, library.nyu.edu 'ARTISTS RESPOND: AMERICAN ART AND THE VIETNAM WAR, 1965-1975' (through Aug. 18) and 'TIFFANY CHUNG: VIETNAM, PAST IS PROLOGUE' (through Sept. 2) at Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington. Everything in ""Artists Respond,"" a big, inspiriting blast of a historical survey, dates from a time when the United States was losing its soul, and its artists -- some, anyway -- were trying to save theirs by denouncing a racist war. Figures well known for their politically hard-hitting work -- Judith Bernstein, Leon Golub, Hans Haacke, Peter Saul, Nancy Spero -- are here in strength. But so are others, like Dan Flavin and Donald Judd and Barnett Newman, seldom associated with visual activism. Concurrent with the survey is a smaller, fine-tuned show by a contemporary Vietnamese-born artist, Tiffany Chung; it views the war through the eyes of people on the receiving end of aggression. (Cotter) 

202-663-7970, americanart.si.edu 'LIZ JOHNSON ARTUR: DUSHA' at the Brooklyn Museum (through Aug. 18). Trying to guess the identity of a photographer by her images is a dubious game, as Johnson Artur proves in this exhibition. Born in Bulgaria to a Russian mother and a Ghanaian father, she trains her camera on neighborhoods in London, Brooklyn and Russia. Some of the best works are the ones of Brooklyn, with dancers in ecstatic poses and audiences urging them on. As a photographer for fashion and music magazines like i-D, The Face and Vibe, Johnson Artur has specialized in people for whom self-fashioning is a way of life. She has forged her own path within the realm of identity politics and has something to teach New Yorkers, who often pride themselves on their diversity. Forget labels, she's saying. You can be many things. (Schwendener)

'MUNDOS ALTERNOS: ART AND SCIENCE FICTION IN THE AMERICAS' at the Queens Museum (through Aug. 18). For this exhibition, the museum remixed a show that originally appeared on the West Coast as part of Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA. From Alex Rivera's 2008 feature film ""Sleep Dealer"" to Glexis Novoa's tiny, dreamy cities doodled directly on the museum walls, it's an impressively broad sample of styles and sensibilities from every corner of the New World. Throughout, its focus on science fiction amplifies and exemplifies the way art illuminates reality by imagining the unreal. (Heinrich) 

718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org 'ONE: EGUNGUN' at the Brooklyn Museum (through Aug. 18). This compact exhibition built around a single work documents an impressive sleuthing exercise concerning an egungun, a ceremonial costume from the Yoruba culture. An elaborate multilayered assemblage of fabrics, it arrived at the museum as a gift in 1998, with little information about its provenance. Last year, Kristen Windmuller-Luna, the museum's new curator of African art, traveled to Nigeria to investigate. Through videos, wall text in English and Yoruba and other displays that address the fabrics that the egungun contains, the show contributes to the crucial debate on African art repatriation and offers an example of the ethos of ""re-circulation"" of works, in dynamic context, under African guidance. (Siddhartha Mitter)

718-638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org 'ALEXANDRIA SMITH: MONUMENTS TO AN EFFIGY' at the Queens Museum (through Aug. 18). Outside the entrance to this exhibition, a Plexiglas panel has been painted to look like stained glass. The theme of worship continues inside the gallery with two antique wooden pews that hover off the floor, two found African masks perched atop imitation Tuscan Doric columns, and a triptych of drawings and paintings that suggests an ascent from the underworld to heaven. Layered over all this is an original aria with gospel tonality sung by Liz Gre. The starting point for this work was the Olde Towne of Flushing Burial Ground; a few miles from the museum, it had been a cemetery for African-American and Native American residents in the 19th century, turned into a park then a playground during the 20th, and recently recognized again as a burial ground. Smith juxtaposes evocations of absence, such as the empty pews, with objects that assert their presence, like a sculpture of oversize, tentacle-like pigtails. In the balance, she's found a way to honor a past that has been only partly exhumed. (Steinhauer) 

718-592-9700, queensmuseum.org 'TOO FAST TO LIVE, TOO YOUNG TO DIE: PUNK GRAPHICS, 1976-1986' at the Museum of Arts and Design (through Aug. 18). Many of the objects on display in this exhibition were first hung in record stores or in the bedrooms of teenagers. Posters promoting new albums, tours and shows are mixed in with album art, zines, buttons and other miscellany. Most of the pieces are affixed to the walls with magnets and are not framed, and almost all show signs of wear. The presentation reinforces that this was commercial art meant for wide consumption, and the ragged edges and prominent creases in the works make the history feel alive. (Richardson)

Travel,"36 Hours in Syracuse, Sicily",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/travel/what-to-do-36-hours-in-syracuse-sicily.html,"Founded by Greeks around 734 B.C., the southeastern Sicilian city that Cicero called ""the greatest and most beautiful of all Grecian cities"" achieved a size and status in the ancient world that made it a rival of major powers like Athens and Carthage. Takeovers and makeovers by Romans, Byzantines, North Africans, Normans and others left their marks as well, influencing everything from religious art to the region's distinctive savory-sweet-sour cooking style. Much of the ancient city has crumbled since Cicero's day, though the ruins can still be explored in Syracuse's celebrated archaeological park and museum. But the main attraction today is the historical center of Syracuse: Ortigia island, a maze of narrow streets, ornate Baroque churches and centuries-old palazzi . And if you've never seen the stunning sunset over the Mediterranean from Ortigia's western promenade, add that to your To Do list.

A passeggiata, or evening walk, around the perimeter of Ortigia reveals many notable structures and stories. Start from the Parco Letterario Elio Vittorini, on the eastern side, and head clockwise. As waves crash against the rocks below the sea wall, you'll pass crenelated lookout points and the chiseled facade of the 17th-century Chiesa dello Spirito Santo , before finding yourself in the palm-planted gardens of the 13th-century Castello Maniace. Continuing up the western side leads you to the spot where the goddess Artemis is said to have transformed a nymph into a natural spring -- the Arethusa Fountain -- and then to another haven of liquids: an outdoor seaside bar called Fratelli Burgio al Porto. A bright orange Aperol spritz costs 7 euros, or about $7.75. The matching sunset is free. ""Waiter! There are raisins in my vegetable medley!"" Please don't say this when your caponata arrives. The raisins are supposed to be there, along with the pine nuts, tangy vinegar-sugar reduction, and slow-stewed eggplant, red peppers, tomatoes and other local vegetables. After all, you've ordered a classic Sicilian dish with one of the finest sweet-savory mash-ups north of Morocco, and the rustic-chic Oinos restaurant crafts it with the subtle spices and flavors it deserves. The comfort-food menu also includes a sculptural tower of eggplant parmigiana, a succulent, fat-lined slab of pork in sage butter, and a beef filet covered with a purple sauce of local Nero d'Avola wine. A three-course dinner for two costs around 80 euros.

The number of Madonnas per square yard in the Galleria Regionale di Palazzo Bellomo -- dedicated mostly to medieval, Renaissance and Baroque art -- must surely approach record status. There she is, alongside her child, towering over a church carried by angels, in a surreal 1507 century painting by Alessandro Padovano and Giovanni Maria Trevisiano. There she is in Gothic mode, resplendent in deep reds, blues and golds, on a time-fissured wooden board by the Master of the Polyptych of Santa Maria. But certainly her most stunning rendition comes from the hand of Antonello da Messina. His 15th-century painting ""Annunciation,"" depicting Mary visited by an angel, is a masterwork of powerful color, exquisite detail and beatific light. Admission, 8 euros. 5) Noon. A few loaves and many fishes Sicily's horn of plenty spills out in a tide of colors, shapes and smells at Ortigia's outdoor market. Walking down the lively, crowded corridor of storefronts, stalls and sidewalk tables, you get a vocabulary lesson and gastronomic tour all in one: purple-green carciofi (artichokes), orange zucche (pumpkins), brown mandorle (almonds), black barrette di cioccolato (chocolate bars) from Modica. But mostly you find freshly hooked and netted fish, including seppie (cuttlefish) and shiny green-black sgombro (mackerel). Breads, nuts, spices and cheeses round out the mix. Around the corner, a trinket market awaits for anyone intent on taking home a Vespa-shaped magnet or ""Godfather"" T-shirt.

Practice your new vocabulary next door at Divino Mare, a simple and colorful seafood joint where many of those words are scrawled and re-scrawled every day on the chalkboard menu. Using the daily catches from their neighbors, the friendly staff serves up fresh carpaccios, ceviches, seafood pastas, fried critters, grilled fish and whole baked undersea creatures. And if orecchiette pasta with tender octopus chunks isn't sufficiently filling, try the garganelli pasta with shrimp in a rich butter-truffle sauce. A two-course meal for two costs about 50 euros. 7) 3 p.m. The sinner and the saint Caravaggio was on the run. Having escaped from prison in Malta, the bad-boy artist (and accused murderer) arrived in Syracuse in 1608 and scored a commission to paint ""The Burial of St. Lucia,"" which today hangs in the Chiesa di Santa Lucia alla Badia (free admission). Dominated by somber blacks and browns, the canvas depicts the corpse of Syracuse's patron saint (the only horizontal element) mourned by a priest in a blood-red scarf (the only splash of bright color) and a crowd of onlookers. But the most mesmerizing component is the diffuse, shadowy emptiness surrounding them. Across the stately Piazza del Duomo stands the cathedral (admission 2 euros), whose architecture and design elements form a survey of Syracuse's history, from the ornately chiseled facade (Baroque) to the kaleidoscopic marble floor (Renaissance) to the soaring stone pillars integrated into the walls (remnants of a 480 B.C. temple to Athena).

Il Piacere della Pelle is a leather-goods shop where all of the simple monochrome bags, backpacks, sandals and more are crafted on site. The boutique is one of many small treasures hidden on Ortigia's narrow streets, and an afternoon shopping stroll is also a journey of discovery that turns up hidden squares, unexpected passages and tons of Old World architecture. A haven of luxurious and colorful packaging, Ortigia Sicilia sells fragrant beauty products made with the island's fruits and flora, such as resin-spice shaving cream and pomegranate soap. You can slip them into a handbag from Lumiere Design, where traditional Sicilian woven baskets are adorned with lace, fur, sequins, gold chains and other upscale accouterments.

Arne Jacobsen or the Eameses would have felt at home inside Room Cucina, a lofty and minimalist new hot spot that channels the spirit of midcentury modernism. They would likely enjoy the cooking, too, which reveals an eye for presentation and a nose for flavorful embellishments. You might start with polpette of tiny neonato fish and mushy asparagus -- literally rolled up into a crispy-fried ball of savory flavors -- before moving on to spaghetti in butter sauce that's loaded with tiny tender clams and slivers of candied lemon. Among mains, the veal isn't one of those thin, breaded, fried-up and dried-out disasters with the flavor of a carpet sample, but rather a thick, juicy cut of meat surrounded by droplets of a sweet-sour balsamic reduction. Expect to pay around 90 euros for a three-course dinner for two.

In the prolific years before he was killed by a tortoise that had been dropped by an eagle, the celebrated Athenian playwright Aeschylus visited the ancient Greek theater of Syracuse to stage ""Women of Etna."" The play, performed there in 475 B.C., has been mostly lost to time, but much of the semicircular stone theater remains impressively intact and hosts performances to this day. Other marquee attractions in the Parco Archeologico della Neapolis are the eroded cliffs and otherworldly geological forms where the Greeks, Romans and others quarried stone. Particularly stunning is the Ear of Dionysus, a soaring jagged cavern on a cathedral scale that amplifies even the tiniest noises into eerie echoes. Admission 10 euros. Your historical odyssey culminates in the Museo Archeologico Regionale Paolo Orsi. All of the favorite Greco-Roman deities, heroes and creatures are there, in ceramic or sculptural form. Hercules drives chariots and fights lions on black-glazed pottery. A grinning satyr sails on a bloated wineskin. The early Christian relics are no less impressive, notably the Sarcophagus of Adelphia, which was discovered in the nearby catacombs of St. Giovanni. Dating to the 4th century, the funerary masterwork is chiseled with 13 biblical scenes -- including the temptation of Adam and Eve, and the wedding at Cana -- in three-dimensional reliefs. Admission 8 euros. Elegant small hotels abound in Syracuse. Occupying an 18th-century townhouse, Re Federico Boutique Hotel has six rooms (including five with kitchenettes) done in tasteful contemporary style, as well as a roof deck with sea views and a ground-floor cafe. Doubles from 144 euros in September. The wooden beams and stone walls of the Baroque-era palazzo that houses Ortigia Royal Suite work well with the modern furniture and artwork in the nine rooms -- some of which have terraces or sea views. From 174 euros per night in September.","Architecture that spans centuries, troves of religious art, a distinctive sweet-savory cuisine and glorious Mediterranean sunsets: This ancient city is filled with timeless riches.",d3ff09ea-8e31-5305-8e59-026e1e426afd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/08/travel/05hours-syracuse-sicily2/05hours-syracuse-sicily2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=af5fde7c2b863a03f204ba182a2279ed8a94143cbd6e66d23f6b55cd33062054&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In Syracuse, taking a passeggiata, or evening walk, around the perimeter of Ortigia island, is a popular activity.",d3ff09ea-8e31-5305-8e59-026e1e426afd,N24News/imgs/d3ff09ea-8e31-5305-8e59-026e1e426afd.jpg,4
Media,Matt Lauer Accuser Speaks Out in Ronan Farrow's New Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/business/media/matt-lauer-ronan-farrow-book.html,"For more than 20 years, Matt Lauer was a star anchor of NBC's most profitable franchise, ""Today."" His downfall came in November 2017 when the network fired him after receiving a complaint of sexual misconduct against him. The accusation was soon followed by others. Now, the circumstances of that firing have resurfaced in a book by the investigative journalist Ronan Farrow that contains new details from Mr. Lauer's primary accuser, including her account of a rape. The book, ""Catch and Kill,"" is expected to be released on Tuesday. The accuser provided an account of her interactions with Mr. Lauer to The New York Times nearly two years ago, but said she was not willing to go public with her story at the time. On Wednesday, Variety reported that Mr. Farrow had secured an on-the-record interview with the woman, Brooke Nevils, who allowed the author to name her. Ms. Nevils gave Mr. Farrow a detailed description of an encounter with Mr. Lauer, which took place when the network was covering the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Lauer anally raped Ms. Nevils, she told Mr. Farrow.

Mr. Lauer denied the allegation in a letter provided by his lawyer on Wednesday. ""In a new book, it is alleged that an extramarital, but consensual, sexual encounter I have previously admitted having was in fact an assault,"" Mr. Lauer wrote. ""It is categorically false, ignores the facts and defies common sense. I had an extramarital affair with Brooke Nevils in 2014. It began when she came to my hotel room very late one night in Sochi, Russia. We engaged in a variety of sexual acts. We performed oral sex on each other, we had vaginal sex, and we had anal sex. Each act was mutual and completely consensual."" Ms. Nevils later responded to Mr. Lauer's letter, calling it ""a case study in victim blaming,"" in a statement published by NBC News. ""There's the Matt Lauer that millions of Americans watched on TV every morning for two decades, and there is the Matt Lauer who this morning attempted to bully a former colleague into silence,"" Ms. Nevils said. ""I am not afraid of him now, regardless of his threats, bullying, and the shaming and predatory tactics I knew he would (and now has) tried to use against me."" Little, Brown, the publisher of ""Catch and Kill,"" had no comment.

Before he left for The New Yorker, Mr. Farrow was a reporter at NBC News, working as a contributor to MSNBC and, for a time, as a correspondent on ""Today,"" with a segment called ""Undercover With Ronan Farrow."" At the time of his departure from the network in August 2017, he was pursuing allegations of sexual misconduct against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein. Mr. Farrow and executives at NBC News disagreed bitterly over whether or not his reporting was ready for broadcast, and their working relationship came to an end.

A news producer who worked with Mr. Farrow at NBC, Rich McHugh, accused the network of impeding Mr. Farrow's reporting on Mr. Weinstein in an interview with The Times last year. He called the interference ""a massive breach of journalistic integrity."" NBC News disagreed. In an email to the staff, the NBC News chairman Andrew Lack said the network ""had nothing yet fit to broadcast."" He added, ""We spent eight months pursuing the story, but at the end of that time, NBC News -- like many others before us -- still did not have a single victim or witness willing to go on the record."" In ""Catch and Kill,"" Mr. Farrow has set his sights on Mr. Lack and the NBC News president Noah Oppenheim. The book includes a detailed account of the pushback Mr. Farrow said he had received from the news division's executives, and his reporting on Mr. Lauer could have reverberations at the network. Up until now, Mr. Farrow had been publicly silent on his disagreements with the network. At the time of Mr. Lauer's firing, NBC News executives said they had not been aware of the host's sexual misconduct until the first accuser filed a complaint. In a memo to the staff on Nov. 29, 2017, Mr. Lack wrote: ""While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he's been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The network started an inquiry. Unlike previous investigations of sexual misconduct involving employees at media companies like NPR and Fox News, which relied on the work of outside law firms, NBC used its own counsel to look into the question of whether or not its executives were aware of Mr. Lauer's behavior before any complaint was lodged against him. Five months after the firing, the NBCUniversal legal team filed a report clearing NBC News management.

Mr. Farrow's book may put the legal team's finding under scrutiny. He reports that Ms. Nevils, the accuser, told many people at NBC, including her superiors, about Mr. Lauer's conduct long before he was fired. NBC News responded to Mr. Farrow's reporting with a statement on Wednesday. ""Matt Lauer's conduct was appalling, horrific and reprehensible, as we said at the time,"" the statement said. ""That's why he was fired within 24 hours of us first learning of the complaint. Our hearts break again for our colleague."" Mr. Lauer became part of an ignominious cohort of media figures felled by sexual misconduct allegations in 2017 and 2018, a group that included Mr. Weinstein, the CBS anchor Charlie Rose and the CBS chairman and president Leslie Moonves. Along with Jodi Kantor and Megan Twohey of The Times, Mr. Farrow was one of the journalists whose investigative reporting, much of which turned up accusations against Mr. Weinstein and Mr. Moonves, advanced the #MeToo movement. The revelations brought about a nationwide reckoning on workplace behavior and a reconsideration of the everyday abuses committed by men in positions of power. Ms. Kantor, Ms. Twohey and Mr. Farrow were prominent among the group of reporters awarded the 2018 Pulitzer Prize in public service. A theme of their work concerned the so-called enablers who stood by as abuses took place. With the imminent arrival of Mr. Farrow's ""Catch and Kill,"" a question coming again to the fore is whether or not that group includes top executives at NBC and NBC News. On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Lack sent a memo to his staff defending the network's handling of Mr. Lauer, as well as its work with Mr. Farrow. The memo, which was obtained by The Times, said that ""any suggestion"" that NBC News executives had known about Mr. Lauer's behavior before the accusation or tried to cover it up ""is absolutely false and offensive.""","The revelations prompted a denial from Mr. Lauer, the former ""Today"" host. His accuser, Brooke Nevils, called the response ""victim shaming.""",01ff4d2d-0b7b-5fef-b8b6-796d564043d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/business/09FARROWBOOK-02/09FARROWBOOK-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=13d29c5843d75f7ef6969111ac082d6d5fa8f83ccd7da6b4a318760f59924c77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Matt Lauer in New York in 2017.,01ff4d2d-0b7b-5fef-b8b6-796d564043d3,N24News/imgs/01ff4d2d-0b7b-5fef-b8b6-796d564043d3.jpg,16
Opinion,The Healing Power of 'Steven Universe',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/opinion/sunday/steven-universe-finale.html,"For most of my life, Taiwan was a place that lived in my head. My mother told me her origin stories like a series of tall tales, full of pitched, tin roofs and fields of underbrush that my grandmother used to drive through on her moped, lifting her legs to avoid snake bites. Her stories felt like aphorisms I could attach to the idea of being Taiwanese, something I knew I was, but felt no particular ability to locate outside the life I lived in California. I could not get past the differences of our childhoods, the disparities in our means, the foreign topography. It would take me years to realize I'd inherited her cultural traditions and perspectives growing up -- and even longer to separate my identity from the need to demonstrate proficiency in it, as if it were a set of actions committed to memory. When I began watching Rebecca Sugar's musical cartoon series ""Steven Universe"" and its limited series spinoff ""Steven Universe Future"" -- which aired its final episodes on Friday -- it immediately fit like a familiar sweater. So much of Steven's coming-of-age story mapped onto my own: We both come from two distinct cultures, the most dominant of which can feel inscrutable. Though Steven's birth father Greg is an Earth dweller, he is raised by the ""Crystal Gems,"" Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl, female-presenting, nonbinary aliens who manifest special powers through gemstones embedded in their bodies. They are Steven's only tether to his deceased mother's birthplace of Gem Homeworld and, as early as the pilot, they begin the difficult work of helping him navigate his powers and his identity.

I was raised primarily by my Taiwanese-born mother and her parents. My white, American-born father was present and loving, but my grandparents' proximity to my childhood home made theirs the nexus of domestic life. It was in that house I learned how to be. I learned to reuse every Ziploc bag and twist tie, to never buy napkins or ketchup -- both of which I could get for free at the Chino Hills Chick-fil-A. I learned to take my shoes off at the door or face verbal recrimination, and to periodically run the engine on the van I would never inherit, lest it die through disuse and the passage of time. (Long after my grandparents had passed, the van's engine was still running.) These stories fit into a well-trod Asian-American immigrant narrative -- one that easily falls victim to broad generalizations and monolithic classification, despite the rich diversity among Asian-American ethnic groups. What remains personally true is the immense pressure I felt to succeed, because my achievements felt like proof of concept: Proof that leaving Taiwan was worth it, proof that we could attain and even improve upon the American dream. I learned to create my own community in the language of code switching between my Taiwanese family in California and my dad's family in Kentucky. My personality became circumstantial, less a person than an echo of the space I lived in. This is also Steven Universe's lot in life, and much of the show is dedicated to his earnest blunderings. Though he looks like a human boy, he carries his mother's gemstone in his bellybutton. He shuttles between Crystal Gem missions and spending time with his human father and friends in the fictional Beach City. He accidentally summons his powers in the presence of his human friends, though he struggles to invoke them during missions. The episodic arcs are painfully familiar, evoking memories of quiet heartbreak, isolation and anxiety. (Luckily, the show has an extremely catchy song, ""Here Comes a Thought,"" about managing anxiety.) When Steven unearths the traumas of the Crystal Gems' migration to Earth, he begins to feel immense pressure to live up to the sacrifices of those who raised him.

This is often conveyed through Pearl, the Crystal Gem who reminds me most of my own mother. In a particularly moving episode, Pearl teaches Steven's human friend Connie how to sword fight so she can defend Steven during their adventures. This is not unlike my mother's own history of subordinating her needs to mine; I also feel a responsibility to fight battles my mother never asked me to. Much of it is in the small things. I watched for years as my mother strategically deployed my father to return goods or pick up the rental car, so she could avoid being racially profiled. Now, when my mother walks into salons where white women are offered beverages while she is handled with overpronounced English, I make a point to ask them if they have tea or coffee for her. When she told me Costco denied her a return on a rotten watermelon because she did not bring it back as evidence, I seriously contemplated fishing it out of the trash. I pick the most pedantic examples because these are the kinds of accommodations any white American would assume they'd receive. I pick these examples because I can control them -- the wounds of her past are inaccessible to me. Just as my perpetual sense of foreignness irritates me, my own rush to act as her personal white savior also irritates me. Providing for our parents is a bedrock of my culture. At the same time, without financial stability or access to capital, I don't know what better I can do than use my white-passing face to fight for a better seat on an airplane, the ability to return defective products and tea at the hair salon. I stare at the mirror wondering about the liminal spaces where my Asian-American identity begins and my whiteness begins, prodding at tender spots where my emotional scars might be separable from those I have inherited. In the finale of ""Steven Universe,"" Steven's gem is grotesquely removed from his body. He splits into two parts. But both of them are Steven, identical in appearance, different only in color grading. What would I be, I wonder, if I were split into two component parts? I am not Steven Universe, I am a speck in the universe that will outlive me. But seeing him cleaved in two to prove the consistency of his identity to his nemeses made me contemplate the ways I perform my identity on the behalf of others. Watching him repeatedly attempt to save the universe made me reflect on the absurd expectations I place on myself. And that is a kind of progress. As a coda to the original series, ""Steven Universe Future"" delivers an even more poignant and direct message as the hero begins to understand the roots of his post-traumatic stress. Without the pressures of saving the world or living for others, Steven finally has time to process his earlier teenage years. Watching him learn to live for himself is an even greater balm.

Art & Design,Was Australopithecus an Artist?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/arts/design/nasher-sculpture-center-dallas-first-sculpture-review.html,"DALLAS -- The Nasher Sculpture Center here is devoted to the art of the modern era, and its elegant pavilion and garden, designed by Renzo Piano, have recently welcomed exhibitions by living masters like Roni Horn, Pierre Huyghe and Giuseppe Penone. Its new show, though, exhibits sculptures from far, far earlier: So far back in human history that the artists -- and we'll come back to whether that term applies -- are not even of our own species. ""First Sculpture,"" an alternately fascinating and flummoxing exhibition of Paleolithic stone artifacts, travels as far from the present day as possible to propose a new genealogy of art history. Stones carved and collected by Neanderthals 150,000 years ago appear in vitrines. Large hand axes, sitting in view of steel sculptures by Mark di Suvero and Richard Serra, date from 300,000 years ago or earlier. Think those are old? ""First Sculpture"" also includes tools from North Africa 800,000 years old, and a spheroid gewgaw, found in South Africa, that was collected by Australopithecus 2.5 million years before today. Though you may have seen tools like this in natural history museums, the proposition of ""First Sculpture,"" from its title onward, is that these are not merely instruments, but art; that they were crafted not just for functional reasons but for aesthetic ones. Moreover, the naturally occurring patterns in some stones -- holes or circular depressions that resemble eyes, for example, or protuberances like noses -- supposedly reveal a hard-wired hunger for representation: an aesthetic impulse in our evolutionary forebears. Are these 80-odd tools, eons more ancient than the ancient world, indeed art works? Can we ever really know? With no artist statement forthcoming from our Stone Age ancestors, the show takes on a strange admixture of science and guesswork, paleoanthropology and wishful thinking. Still, the uncertainty of its thesis is part of its pleasure; a great work of art, after all, is always a thing we don't fully understand. Whatever their status, the objects are astonishing.

It convinces most in the section devoted to hand axes. Stone Age humans, principally the species Homo erectus, would use rocks, bones or antlers to fracture larger boulders, hewing sharp tools in a laborious process known as knapping. Though Australopithecus (four million to three million years ago) made blunt cutting tools, Homo erectus (1.9 million to 100,000 years ago) fashioned finer implements, tapering from the butt to the point and flaked on two sides, to form the familiar teardrop now paradigmatic of early man. There are dozens here, and at a display by the entrance of ""First Sculpture,"" visitors can handle three specimens, each 7 or 8 inches long and weighing about five pounds, crafted by our fellow hominins between 200,000 and 700,000 years ago. Their satisfying heft and ergonomic shape offer an unnerving haptic trace of human life before contemporary humankind.

The hand axes do disclose evident aesthetic choices. Two examples here, crafted in England 300,000 years ago, have curving edges whose sinuousness offers no functional advantage -- a Paleolithic echo of Hogarth's line of beauty. Some are punctured with holes, usually placed near the center of the tool. (You couldn't use them as a grip; you'd break your finger.) One ax found in England has a shell embedded in it. Others have atypical colors or textures. An ax of iron stone from South Africa has alternating yellow and gray grooves, like the ridges of a topographic map; another, from Mauritania, was hewed from a block of striated gneiss that could well have been chosen for its beauty. Five oversized hand axes, more than a foot tall, would have been too heavy for a single hand to wield; they may also have been for show.

Most of these artifacts come from the collection of Tony Berlant, a Pop artist in Los Angeles and a lay authority on prehistoric art, who has co-curated ""First Sculpture"" with Thomas Wynn, an anthropologist at the University of Colorado. (Collector-curator shows can raise hackles -- the museum's prestige stands to increase the collection's value -- but the catalog notes that Mr. Berlant and Mr. Wynn first sought loans from nearly two dozen museums worldwide. Though they borrowed objects from the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the British Museum in London, and institutions in France, Israel, Tanzania and South Africa, the pair found that Mr. Berlant's own objects were often of greater quality than those in public collections. The Nasher's director clarified to The Times that Mr. Berlant does not intend to disperse his collection in the future.)

The curators have surely put their fingers on the scale by staging the show at a modern art center, where the hand axes and stones appear in an immaculate light far from the dinosaur bones and dioramas of the universal museum. And they have overplayed their hand on the question of aesthetic intent. Can we really say that eight hand axes from the British Museum, as Mr. Berlant and Mr. Wynn claim, were made by four individual members of the species Homo heidelbergensis, ""by far the oldest individual artisans ever recognized""? Yet the axes themselves, finely tuned weapons whose ridged faces resemble oyster shells, certainly have a visual attraction that exceeds pure function. Even earlier hand tools, the largest here 1.5 million years old, were hewn into nearly ideal spheres whose shape did not increase their utility. If we define art as a form that exceeds use, then these are indeed some of the oldest aesthetic objects on earth. Someone a little like us invested extra time and effort to enact these shapes on hard stone.

Did they also find meaning in the shapes those stones naturally displayed? The bolder, even foolhardy second half of ""First Sculpture"" suggests so through a collection of ""figure stones,"" or objects that early humans supposedly appreciated for their resemblance to animals or human faces. Some are functional objects, such as a quartzite cleaver from Mauritania with two circular bumps that produce, as the catalog has it, ""a feline face."" Others have no clear function. Mr. Berlant has acquired a suite of stones from Fontmaure, France, which Neanderthals supposedly chipped and knapped to accentuate the faces they saw in them. One large rock has two holes above a jutting knob: a face, if you turn right side up. Another bears an almost comic resemblance to a Picasso profile.

It falls to us, the overdressed apes in contemporary museums, to make sense of these incomprehensible rocks. On the one hand, imputing figures into these stones projects modern ideas of proportion and beauty onto ""artists"" of not just another culture, but another species. This is a primitivist impulse, and should be avoided, especially when these supposed art objects could merely be junk from the cave floor. We see faces here -- but we see faces in clouds, too. On the other hand, art itself no longer means what it did when the first paleoanthropologists ascribed artistic intent to our fossil kin. Before the 20th century, art was understood as a direct act of creation, whose earliest manifestation would be cave paintings from 30,000 or 40,000 years ago (quite recently, in the timeline of ""First Sculpture."") After Duchamp's invention of the ready-made, the definition changed. Art could be an encounter between an object that already existed -- a urinal, a bicycle wheel, a stone in a grotto -- and an idea about that object, fused into a new union beyond functionality. By that definition, the 2.5 million-year-old Makapansgat pebble, lent to this show from the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, could indeed be the world's first work of art. It's made of jasperite, a stone not present at the site where it was found, and it bears two shallow indentations like eyes, another beneath where a mouth should be, and a hatch mark like a brow above. A member of Australopithecus, whose brain was just a third the size of ours, must have found this stone and brought it some distance. And if he or she did see a face in its surface -- not out of the question; other primates' brains have evolved for face recognition, one of the most important skills in social relationships -- then this Australopithecus would have been thinking like an artist.

We can never be sure whether any individual stone or spheroid is an intentional creation, or just a leftover from prehistoric industry. What we can say, and what this intelligent, imprudent and thoroughly enjoyable exhibition does show, is that art has a far deeper tradition than usually acknowledged. Hegel famously argued that art was born from spirituality, and that modern painting and sculpture could never equal the old stuff. But if ""First Sculpture"" is correct, the impulse for art predates that of religions by uncountable millenniums, and might even predate humanity itself. Right or wrong, that was a lot to absorb in Dallas, as my eyes shuttled across the Pleistocene and my fingers swiped the touch-screen of the blunt hand ax I tote everywhere.","""First Sculpture"" argues that our Stone Age ancestors created these objects not merely as tools, but as art. Can we ever really know for sure?

Automobiles,A Rivalry That Helped Turn a Pastime Into a Profession,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/automobiles/rivalry-that-helped-turn-pastime-into-a-profession.html,"FROM Santa Maria in Santa Barbara County to Carlsbad near San Diego, dragstrips once spread thick across Southern California. Lions in Wilmington, Orange County International in Irvine and tracks in Irwindale, San Gabriel and San Fernando were among the many that popped up and, just as often, suddenly disappeared. Drag racing started its transformation into a professional sport in Southern California of the 1960s, growing beyond its stature as the counterculture alongside the counterculture; the supercharged, nitromethane-fed alternative to square and hippie living. How all that began to change in 1970 is a turning point in ""Snake & Mongoose,"" an independent film in the postproduction stage. As a moderately budgeted drag racing biography picture, ""Snake & Mongoose"" is similar in scope and ambition to 1983's ""Heart Like A Wheel."" And along with coming films like Ron Howard's look at Formula One, ""Rush,"" it is part of what may be a minirevival of the racing-movie genre arriving in 2013. Tracing the lives, friendship, rivalry and partnership of the drag racers Don Prudhomme and Tom McEwen -- known universally to fans as Snake and Mongoose -- the film spans the early 1960s through their showdown in the final round of the 1978 United States Nationals. Plans are for the film to appear in theaters next spring.

Spread across the end of the track at Famoso Raceway in this San Joaquin Valley outpost near Bakersfield on a bright day in early June, the 60-some film crew of ""Snake & Mongoose"" looked sparse by Hollywood studio standards. But they were shooting at a fast clip, using Famoso to double for strips around the country, and recording on Arri Alexa high-definition video cameras. ""He ought to give him the finger,"" exclaimed Prudhomme, bolting out of his chair. Now 71, he had been watching a scene where his younger self taunts McEwen after a 1970 funny car race when the inspiration struck. ""That's what I really did,"" he added, turning from the flat-screen monitor and heading to the pop-up canopy where the film's British director, Wayne Holloway, was working. Moments later, Prudhomme was back, lowering himself back into the chair. ""They can't do that,"" he said with a shrug. ""Snake & Mongoose"" is the creation of Alan Paradise, an automotive journalist. In 2005, Mr. Paradise was working on a TV project about the 35th anniversary of the landmark sponsorship agreement that Prudhomme and McEwen forged with Mattel's Hot Wheels toy car brand when McEwen suggested he write a book about the racers.

""As I got to the end of the book, I began to write a screenplay,"" he said, Mattel's 1970 sponsorship of Prudhomme and McEwen, and the subsequent marketing of their rivalry, changed drag racing. With a few exceptions, racecars, even at the highest levels of the sport, typically carried a driver's or team's names on its doors and some small stickers from automotive-related sponsors. With the success of the Hot Wheels sponsorship, mainstream product marketing poured into the sport. Once-itinerant racers became professionals. Touring ""match races"" faded, giving way to the series of national events sanctioned by the National Hot Rod Association. ""The Snake and Mongoose story has a lot of different twists,"" Mr. Paradise said. ""There were tragedies on and off the track and this huge marketing idea. It changed how all sports were marketed. It's tough for people to understand that."" Besides Prudhomme and McEwen, the most prominent elements in Mattel's marketing were the fiberglass-body, Plymouth-branded funny cars they drove in 1970 -- Prudhomme's yellow Barracuda and McEwen's red Duster. Reproduced as Hot Wheels toys, the flip-top cars became instant preteen icons, and the ""Mongoose and Snake Drag Race Set,"" with twin loops and pop out drag chutes, was a toy for which a 9-year old would trade his Schwinn Sting-Ray. For this grown boy, the sight of the actual yellow 1970 Snake funny car on the movie set was dazzling. Brought out of Prudhomme's collection along with his matching 1967 Dodge D-700 ramp truck that was used to haul it, it was one of the dozen-or-so vintage racers recruited to the film. A reproduction of McEwen's 1970 Duster sat atop the 1969 Dodge D-700 once used by the Mongoose team (and now owned by Prudhomme). Prudhomme's Army-sponsored Plymouth Arrow Funny Car from the mid-70s was also there next to McEwen's English Leather 1978 Corvette. Vintage racecars are, however, irreplaceable and convincingly restaging 200 mile-an-hour crashes is nearly impossible. So digitally enhanced historical footage is used in the film. ""Primarily it's N.H.R.A.-controlled footage,"" Stephen Nemeth, the producer, said. ""With bits and pieces from other libraries.""

Jesse Williams from ABC's ""Grey's Anatomy"" portrays Prudhomme and is a ringer for the drag racer. Richard Blake, who plays McEwen, seems to have the Mongoose's pugnacity. Also in the cast are Noah Wyle as a Mattel executive; Ian Ziering as the engine builder Keith Black; and John Heard as Wally Parks, the president of N.H.R.A. Spreading out from its California roots, drag racing is today an entrenched part of motor sports culture with a high-dollar professional gloss. The N.H.R.A., the sport's dominant organizer, points out that among racing series, it is second only to Nascar in ""attendance, fan appeal, and sponsorship commitment."" That's a distant second, though. According to ESPN, which broadcasts the 23 events of N.H.R.A.'s Full Throttle Drag Racing Series, the TV audience is only about one-eighth the size of the Nascar Sprint Cup series. So there is no guarantee the film will live up to the Snake and Mongoose legend, much less the fantasies of thousands of car crazed adults who once played, or still play, with the toys.",Tracing the careers of the drag racers Don Prudhomme and Tom McEwen — known to fans as Snake and Mongoose — a new film spans the early days of the sport and how a major sponsorship changed it.,b5c262f3-c687-5d48-b551-995cc13fd20b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/05/automobiles/05SNAK2/05SNAK2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=206&w=600&s=7934544b263b5596cc6c848a37996700558de8e7fcf0f04a905f96f79bf7d95f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"EARLY DAYS The rivalry of Tom McEwen and Don Prudhomme helped popularize drag racing.

Automobiles,Monday Motorsports: Nascar Announces Sprint Cup Chase Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/04/automobiles/monday-motorsports-nascar-announces-sprint-cup-chase-changes.html,"Nascar announced on Thursday changes to its end-of-season playoffs, the Sprint Cup Chase for the Championship. The changes, officials said, would place a greater emphasis on winning races. The old format pitted 12 drivers - the top 10 in points and two wild-card entries -- against one another in the final 10 races of the year in a runoff to decide the driving title. Jimmie Johnson, who won six races in 2013, collected his sixth championship, edging out Matt Kenseth, who had seven wins.

The new format will include 16 drivers, with elimination rounds that will whittle the field to the top finishing four, for the season finale at Homestead, Fla., in November. Had the new system been in place in 2013, the series champion would have been Dale Earnhardt Jr., who failed to win a single race.

# Glenn Roberts, Tim Flock, Jack Ingram, Maurice Petty and Dale Jarrett were inducted Wednesday into the Nascar Hall of Fame in a ceremony in Charlotte, N.C.

Roberts, considered one of the sport's first superstars, died from complications to injuries he received in a 1964 wreck. Flock, who died in 1998, won championships in the 1950s and even won a race at Hickory Motor Speedway with a monkey, named Jocko Flocko, in the car with him. Ingram, a star decades ago in some of Nascar's second- and third-tier series, won more than 300 Nascar-sanctioned races.",Nascar again shuffles rules for end-of-season Chase for the Championship; five men are inducted into the Nascar Hall of Fame.,aedeed4c-b308-56ed-b9c5-fe290d327c63,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/04/automobiles/04MOTORSPORTS-image/04MOTORSPORTS-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=363&w=600&s=efb156063f793164fb53b114cac1ad3eafaaf86817f3531dd320d52340898f81&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Jimmie Johnson celebrates after winning his sixth Nascar Sprint Cup title in November.

Sports,"Manny Machado Gets His Payday, but It Won't Quell Free Agency Gripes",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/19/sports/manny-machado-padres-contract.html,"TAMPA, Fla. -- If the San Diego Padres had stayed away from elite free agents this winter, people would have understood. They gave out the richest contract on last year's free-agent market, yet finished with their worst record in a decade. But the Padres could not resist the allure of Manny Machado, and on Tuesday they established a new standard for free agency to get him. They agreed with Machado on a 10-year contract worth $300 million, the most ever guaranteed to a free agent. The Padres did not announce the agreement, because Machado must first pass a physical, but the deal -- which includes an opt-out clause after 2023 -- was confirmed by a person in baseball with direct knowledge of it. Machado, a four-time All-Star at third base and shortstop, spent last season with the Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles Dodgers, hitting .297 with 37 homers and 107 R.B.I. He joins first baseman Eric Hosmer -- who signed with the Padres last February for eight years and $144 million -- in an effort to revive a team that went 66-96 last season, its eighth losing record in a row.

The Yankees have baseball's other $300 million player, outfielder Giancarlo Stanton, who is entering the fifth year of a 13-year, $325 million contract extension he signed with his previous team, the Miami Marlins. Stanton said Machado's deal was ""great for him,"" but it did not seem to quell his dismay at the state of free agency in baseball. Indeed, Tuesday's news is unlikely to stifle the rhetoric from players, who always expected Machado and Harper to get lucrative contracts. Players are more concerned about the rank-and-file free agents who have struggled to find jobs as several teams field threadbare rosters. Stanton cited infielder Mike Moustakas, who hit 38 homers for Kansas City in 2017 and then turned down a one-year qualifying offer for $17.4 million. He lingered on the open market, returned to the Royals for one year and $6.5 million, then signed another one-year deal with Milwaukee for $10 million on Sunday. ""You've got guys hitting 30-plus homers who have to settle for one year, below their grade of pay, going year to year,"" Stanton said, referring to Moustakas. ""We've got to figure it out. It's not good. Not good on the players' side."" Baseball's collective-bargaining agreement clearly encourages teams to rebuild with prospects -- that is, to accept losing for a while -- by baking in so many incentives to help the worst teams get the best amateur talent. But not all unsigned free agents are unwanted. One factor we rarely know is the value of the offers free agents reject. Pitchers like Dallas Keuchel and Craig Kimbrel have not found suitable contracts yet, but it is possible they have priced themselves out. The data revolution has changed how teams evaluate players, and those who refuse to accept this can be left out. For Machado, his youth and performance prevailed in the end, leading to a record deal. The Padres should have plenty of cheap labor around him -- they have seven of the game's top 50 prospects, as ranked by MLB.com -- and hope to finally win a World Series for a city with no other major pro sports teams.

For most of their 50 seasons, the Padres have been better known for helping other teams win. This is the franchise that dealt Ozzie Smith to St. Louis, Roberto Alomar to Toronto, Gary Sheffield to the Marlins, Fred McGriff to Atlanta and Anthony Rizzo to the Chicago Cubs. All of those players won championships with their new teams. Machado struck out against Boston's Chris Sale to end the World Series last October, but at least he got there. The Padres have not been since 1998. They remain a long way from contention -- quick, name two Padres pitchers -- but took an important step on Tuesday with a deal that shows there is plenty of money to go around in this sport.","Machado's deal is the first free-agent contract to guarantee a player $300 million, but concern about unsigned rank-and-file players is not going away.",c236dd2b-d67a-5205-ba1c-c160367ad9e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/20/sports/20kepner-machado-sub/20kepner-machado-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=46a2705bc44528f515c1a1d31219316afb42bae57c8b5d91b730be9642154853&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Manny Machado, 26, spent last season with the Baltimore Orioles and the Los Angeles Dodgers, hitting .297 with 37 homers and 107 runs batted in.",c236dd2b-d67a-5205-ba1c-c160367ad9e1,N24News/imgs/c236dd2b-d67a-5205-ba1c-c160367ad9e1.jpg,9

The price for the sprawling co-op, which encompasses the eighth floor of 810 Fifth Avenue and faces Central Park, is $22 million, according to John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens, the broker handling the sale. Monthly maintenance is $12,663. The apartment was set to be listed in early April, but those plans were delayed as the coronavirus outbreak overtook New York. Mr. Burger said he was listing the property now as Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo further relaxes restrictions on real estate activity that were implemented to curb the spread of the virus.

He and his wife, Elizabeth Rohatyn, who died in 2016, moved to the exclusive, limestone-clad building on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 62nd Street in the early 1980s, reportedly paying around $2 million for their apartment. In 2011, ownership was transferred into a trust. The home has around 3,875 square feet, with four bedrooms and four and a half baths. Over the years, the couple played host to foreign dignitaries, business executives and politicians there. ""This is an enormously elegant space,"" said Nicolas Rohatyn, an investment banker and one of Mr. Rohatyn's three sons, ""a perfectly dimensioned space."" Although the apartment has ""good bones,"" he said, it ""will need to be spiffed up."" The prewar layout has remained largely intact, including separate wings for entertainment, bedrooms and staff, though some rooms and corridors have been enlarged or eliminated. A number of built-ins have also been added. The Boston-based designer William Hodgins decorated the space with an eclectic mix of antiques and traditional furnishings, along with artworks from Impressionists and old masters like Claude Monet, Pierre Bonnard and Canaletto. Many of the original architectural details also remain, including the herringbone oak floors, 10-foot ceilings, two wood-burning fireplaces, ornate moldings and oversize windows.

The apartment is entered through a spacious central gallery, just off a private elevator that opens to a large, park-facing living room and library on the west side, each with a fireplace, and to a formal dining room with a crystal chandelier. Beyond the dining room is a windowed, eat-in kitchen with a butler's pantry. ""His favorite spot in the apartment was the library,"" Nicolas Rohatyn said, recalling how his father would eat meals in the corner room as he looked out on the expanded views of Fifth Avenue and the park. ""It's a super comfortable room. The living room was comfortable, too."" Off the gallery is a powder room, then a long corridor that leads to the east wing and most of the bedrooms, one of which is currently used as an office, and another for storage. (From one of the bedrooms you can see the penthouse where Joan Rivers once lived, at 1 East 62nd Street.) The enormous master suite contains two spacious dressing rooms and two tiled bathrooms, one with a whirlpool tub. On the apartment's north side is the staff area, which includes a bedroom, now being used for storage, a bathroom and a laundry room.","The apartment was the longtime home of Felix G.

Media,"Robert Sam Anson, 'Bare-Knuckled' Magazine Writer, Dies at 75",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/business/media/robert-sam-anson-dead.html,"He covered wars, politics and brash, complicated men -- like himself. His profile subjects included Oliver Stone, Tupac Shakur and David Geffen.

Robert Sam Anson, a virtuoso of magazine writing who ventured with equal brio into the mean streets of Los Angeles, the jungles of Southeast Asia and the psyches of prominent American men, died on Monday at a home where he had been staying in Rexford, N.Y. He was 75. The cause was complications of dementia, his son, Sam Anson, said. A bear of a man who resembled the actor James Coburn, Mr. Anson wrote mostly for Vanity Fair, where he was a contributing editor for more than two decades, but also for Esquire, Life, The Atlantic and New Times, a short-lived crusading magazine of the left in the mid-1970s. He was ""the last of a breed of broad-shouldered, bare-knuckled, '70s magazine journalists who will chopper into any hellhole on earth and come back with an epic story,"" his Esquire editor, David Hirshey, once said. Mr. Anson's byline promised vigorous writing, vivid scene-setting and insight into complicated, sometimes difficult men, of whom he was one.

""He, too, was magnetic and brash, turbulent and complex, passionate and fascinating,"" David Friend, an editor at Vanity Fair, wrote in a tribute after Mr. Anson's death. Among those he profiled were the director Oliver Stone, who at the time was making his controversial movie about the assassination of John F. Kennedy; Tupac Shakur, in a piece written after the rap star's death; David Geffen, the music mogul, who allowed Mr. Anson a glimpse into his kaleidoscopic life; and Doug Kenney, the comic genius and co-founder of National Lampoon, whose life was anything but funny. ""The thing about Bob was that he was both vulnerable and imposing at the same time,"" Graydon Carter, the former editor of Vanity Fair, said in an email interview. ""The wild man of his youth -- and he was really out there -- gave way to a journalist of towering bravery and ingenuity."" As a 24-year-old correspondent for Time magazine in Cambodia, Mr. Anson was taken prisoner of war in 1970 and held for weeks by the North Vietnamese and their murderous allies, the Khmer Rouge.

Mr. Anson probed his own psyche in the last of his six books, ""War News: A Young Reporter in Indochina"" (1989), a personal story of camaraderie, competition and the thrill of danger. He was so exhilarated to be covering the war, he was hardly aware of the bullets flying around him. He frequently traveled over dangerous roads where some of his colleagues had been killed or kidnapped. Such daredevilry, Mr. Anson wrote, ""was a means where every day you could test yourself, your willingness to push the limits."" ""And God knows it was fun,"" he added, ""not just the doing of it, but the recounting of it later at cocktail time, where everyone claimed the closest call."" In reviewing the book for The New York Times, Harrison E. Salisbury called it ""the story of a very young man at war, a tale that is told with gusto and excitement and captures a correspondent's almost reckless pursuit of danger."" An opinionated man who was fiercely protective of his work, Mr. Anson was not an easy edit. ""He talked back to editors,"" Ken Auletta, a media writer for The New Yorker and a longtime friend, said in a phone interview.

""And he would call people out,"" he added. ""If a fellow reporter was cutting corners or not being aggressive in his questioning, he would call them out. He made enemies that way. But from his point of view, he was telling the truth."" Robert Sam Anson was born on March 12, 1945, in Cleveland. His mother, Virginia Rose Anson, was a schoolteacher. His father was not in the picture, and his mother and her parents raised him. His grandfather, Sam B. Anson, was a major figure in journalism in Cleveland, where he held publishing and editing jobs at the city's daily papers. His grandmother, Edith (McConville) Anson, was a homemaker. Life at home was something of a journalistic boot camp. When Robert was a child, he later told friends, his grandfather would quiz him on current events. If he gave a wrong answer, his grandfather would throw something at him. As Mr. Anson recounted in his LinkedIn profile, he was expelled from one school for what he said was his ""resistance to idiotic rules."" His punishment for one misdeed was to copy, by hand, Stephen Crane's ""The Red Badge of Courage,"" which ""proved useful"" when he covered Vietnam, he wrote. He graduated from the Jesuit-run St. Ignatius High School in Cleveland in 1963 and went on to Notre Dame, where he majored in English and international relations. He graduated in 1967. Mr. Anson's three marriages ended in divorce. His brief first marriage, to Diane McAniff, whom he had met in college, was in the late 1960s. He was married, again briefly, to Sharon Haddock, a lawyer, in the mid-1970s. He married Amanda Kay Kyser, an artist, in 1985; they divorced in 2017. In addition to his son, Mr. Anson is survived by two daughters, Christian Anson Kasperkovitz and Georgia Grace Anson; a sister, Edith Schy; and a grandson.

Time magazine hired him soon after college to work in its Los Angeles bureau. He covered politics, organized crime and what he once described as ""a smorgasbord of mayhem,"" which included the sensational killing of the actress Sharon Tate and others by followers of Charles Manson. After he returned from Southeast Asia, he followed the 1972 presidential campaign, which led to his first book, ""McGovern: A Biography"" (1972). It was the authorized story of Senator George McGovern, the South Dakota Democrat who lost that election in a landslide to President Richard M. Nixon.

His other books include ""Gone Crazy and Back Again: The Rise and Fall of the Rolling Stone Generation"" (1981), a history of Rolling Stone magazine and its editor, Jann Wenner; ""Exile: The Unquiet Oblivion of Richard M. Nixon"" (1984), which examined the former president's life after he left the White House; and ""Best Intentions: The Education and Killing of Edmund Perry"" (1987), about a Black honors student from Harlem who was killed by a white police officer in 1985. In a departure for a man so identified with being a writer, Mr. Anson accepted an offer in 1995 to become editor of Los Angeles magazine. His brief tenure was a disaster. Shortly after he took the reins, The Los Angeles Times wrote a scathing piece about him, portraying him as mercurial, pugnacious and sexist, ""the kind of writer colleagues imagined nursed a Hemingway complex."" Others believed he was a gifted editor whose disruption of a stodgy workplace was bound to ruffle feathers. Still, he and the magazine parted ways after just five months.","He covered wars, politics and brash, complicated men — like himself.

Your Money,Women Know More About Finances Than They Get Credit For,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/your-money/erasing-the-gender-gap-in-financial-knowledge.html,"Women Know More About Finances Than They Get Credit For

ON occasion, when my female friends and I are sitting around talking, the issue of money will come up. And generally, most will readily admit that they don't know anywhere near as much about their family finances as they should. I find that interesting, but not surprising. After all, so many studies and news media reports reinforce the idea that women lag men in understanding how to handle their money. But recently, some experts in personal finance are challenging the common wisdom, saying that the differences in how men and women deal with finances have been overstated. Further, they say, it does no service to women to portray them as naive and in need of special help. ""A lot of the industry is flat-out condescending to women,"" said Helaine Olen, a financial journalist and the author of the book ""Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry.""

The real problem, Ms. Olen said, is that women often earn less money than men yet live longer. They also tend more frequently than men to drop in and out of the labor force to stay at home with children. ""I'm afraid this niching of women is a way to get around the systemic problems"" that need to be addressed through public policy, she said. Ms. Olen also said that some of the advice for women, like to cut back on shopping, is unhelpful at best and sexist at worst. A 2011 Gallup poll showed that men spend $11 more a day than women, Ms. Olen wrote in her book. Annamaria Lusardi, a professor of economics and accountancy at George Washington University and the academic director of the Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center, said the idea ""that women spend more is a myth."" But she said there is a clear gender difference when it comes to financial literacy, not just in this country but around the world. Professor Lusardi was the co-author of a study of eight countries -- the United States, Japan, New Zealand, Germany, the Netherlands, Sweden, Italy and Russia -- that found that the overall level of financial literacy was low. According to the study, Americans had a harder time with simple calculations, but no country stood out as being particularly knowledgeable.

The study, ""Financial Literacy Around the World: An Overview,"" was published in 2011 in The Journal of Pension Economics and Finance. Professor Lusardi said women in all the countries studied were less likely than men to correctly answer questions about financial literacy, particularly those that used technical terms. The more sophisticated the question and the more financial jargon that was used, the less likely women were to answer the questions correctly, she said. But she said the take-away shouldn't be that women were more ignorant. Here's one example: ""Buying a single company's stock usually provides a safer return than a stock mutual fund."" The answer options are true, false, do not know or refuse to answer. (The answer is false.) In the United States, men answered correctly 57.1 percent of the time, compared with 46.8 percent of women. In Germany, both sexes picked the right answer more often than those in the United States did, but the difference between the sexes was similar, with 67.6 percent men and 56.8 percent of women scoring correctly. But, and this is interesting, ""When we took away the 'do not know' option, women were no less likely to choose the wrong answer,"" Professor Lusardi said. ""So if forced to pick an answer, women seem to know as much as men."" When women and men were asked to self-assess their financial knowledge, men tended to give themselves high scores -- even when that is not warranted by their actual knowledge -- while women tended to give themselves lower scores. ""Women are aware of their lack of knowledge,"" Professor Lusardi said, while ""men are less willing to admit what they don't know.""

Manisha Thakor, a financial adviser who runs MoneyZen Wealth Management and specializes in helping women, agreed that everyone struggled with financial information. Investing has become more complex, she said, ""and formal education in the traditional academic setting hasn't kept up. Both genders are confused, but my experience as a professional is that women may be more willing to ask for information."" Ms. Thakor compared it to the cliche that women were more inclined to ask for directions than men. Men also experience financial stereotyping, she said, because society puts a lot of pressure on men to understand, or at least to pretend to understand, the ins and out of finances. ""I will say that the default lingo of the financial services industry is male-speak,"" Ms. Thakor said, referring to terms like ""play the market"" or ""dominating the field."" ""It sounds like a battle,"" she said. And such analogies tend to make women feel excluded. Ms. Olen said that sports terms can be difficult for some women, particularly those of an older generation who may not have grown up playing team sports. But that doesn't mean women should be advised by only women or be talked to differently than men, she said. ""A good adviser, male or female, should be able to do this,"" Ms. Olen said. ""All talk should be understood by both genders."" As she writes in her book, ""There is a fine line between making the industry more friendly to women and overtly condescending to them, and frankly, it is a line few have managed to tread successfully.""

Tahira K. Hira, a professor of personal finance and consumer economics at Iowa State University, said her research had shown that men and women had different learning styles. Men find it easier to learn from technology, she said, while women prefer to learn from a person. Catering to those differences, she said, can be helpful. ""Most of us agree that women are conditioned differently than men about money,"" Professor Hira said. ""Even in this day and age, we have different expectations for our daughters than our sons."" What about the often-cited idea that women are more averse to risk than men? ""In my view, we don't have convincing evidence that women invest in less risky assets then men,"" Professor Lusardi said. In fact, Julie Nelson, the chairwoman of the economics department at the University of Massachusetts Boston, reviewed 24 papers that reported women were less likely to take financial or gambling risks. She found that the papers consistently exaggerated relatively small statistical differences. ""The stereotype that men take more risks than women is very strong,"" she said, but it doesn't hold up under scrutiny. She said the risk-taking behavior of men and women was more alike than different, for the most part. Besides, as Professor Nelson and others point out, greater risk-taking doesn't always promise a better return. Because of the gender gap in income and life expectancy, women may need different financial projections. But, she said, ""I find it disempowering to say women have special needs when it comes to understanding finances.""",Research shows that men and women are more alike than the conventional wisdom suggests when dealing with money matters.,0833f0aa-c035-551d-bc9e-bb9e608cd44c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/18/your-money/18shortcuts/18shortcuts-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=399&w=600&s=6d36cb7a4ddd9a177ebd062b2684e660bc1363503bcca96da9ae6303248f8881&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Helaine Olen, author of  ""Pound Foolish: Exposing the Dark Side of the Personal Finance Industry.""",0833f0aa-c035-551d-bc9e-bb9e608cd44c,N24News/imgs/0833f0aa-c035-551d-bc9e-bb9e608cd44c.jpg,21
Food,An Unforgettable Holiday Centerpiece,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/dining/unforgettable-holiday-centerpiece.html,"Good morning. Gabrielle Hamilton wrote a lovely piece for The Times this week, about end-of-year extravagances -- caviar sandwiches and homemade Boston cream doughnuts and the like -- and particularly about the whole roast suckling pig (above) she has at one holiday party a year -- ""with its crackling skin so crisp it sounds as if you are cutting a loaf of bread, and its profoundly sticky, ribbon-soft, milky meat.""

The recipe is just great: honest and clear, a builder of confidence. I don't know that you'll be able to get yourself a 15-pounder before Christmas dinner calls, but you sure can by New Year's Eve and ought to, for the delight in consuming such an easily prepared, visually stunning meal.

Oh, I hear you. It can be strange, to cook this particular animal in the round, to pose it like a sleeping Labrador puppy in your largest roasting pan, then slide it into a hot oven. But unless you're a vegetarian or vegan, it is likely just a psychological hiccup, to feel so unsettled. Not a month ago you cooked a whole turkey in the same pan! And you cannot have it both ways. Gabrielle again: ""I think that the virtuous frown on hypocrisy more than they frown on conscientious protein consumption.""

For dinner tonight, though, consider a meal that steers in the opposite direction from pork.

You might try this terrific vegetarian mushroom shawarma, with a turmeric-tinged yogurt sauce, and lots and lots of cilantro and mint. Or maybe a big bowl of linguine with crisp chickpeas and rosemary? It's never not a good time to eat a big salad with grains.","An end-of-year extravagance, Gabrielle Hamilton's whole roast suckling pig is an easily prepared, visually stunning project.",5bf40a62-59ca-53d5-9a61-81bb57adfe79,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/22/magazine/22mag-eat-image-copy/22mag-eat-image-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=f54eb2d47ff60b75b35a653c9618461f5b36669b4c1d040a544fb2eef3c92f3e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Whole roast suckling pig.,5bf40a62-59ca-53d5-9a61-81bb57adfe79,N24News/imgs/5bf40a62-59ca-53d5-9a61-81bb57adfe79.jpg,17
Health,'This Does Not Look Good for Children': Fires Pose Risk to Young Lungs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/health/wildfires-children-lungs.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Ian MacDonald, a 14-year-old in Portland, Ore., got a treat from his parents the other day. He was allowed to go outside. It was for less than five minutes. ""I let him take out the garbage. We wore N95 masks,"" said his father, Dr. Kelvin MacDonald, who has been insisting his family stay in the house as wildfires flare nearby. Dr. MacDonald is a pediatric pulmonologist, and he is concerned about the health risks to children from the ashen-thick air. ""It is unethical to expose them and find out what happens 50 years from now,"" said Dr. MacDonald, who is also an associate professor of pediatrics at the Oregon Health & Science University. While the science is still emerging, he said, the thrust is already clear: ""This does not look good for children."" The fire that is breathing down the Pacific Northwest and parts of California poses particular peril to young lungs, and is especially acute for children with medical conditions like asthma, which afflicts one in 12 children. Their lungs can become so inflamed by the micro-particles that airways may close, creating -- in extreme cases -- mortal threat.

Healthy children exposed to wildfire smoke at the current levels, even for just a few weeks, can become vulnerable to infection, too, in some cases triggering latent asthma. Such exposures can heighten existing asthma symptoms and increase hospital visits, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and research from the Environmental Protection Agency. In the short-term, smoke can kill immune system cells that protect the lungs from pneumonia and other disease. In the long run, doctors fear, such toxin exposure could prompt asthma in children with a genetic predisposition but who might otherwise not have contracted it. Much of 2020 has been spent focusing on imperiled lungs of the older and the infirm, who are at greater risk of Covid-19, but these fires prey on developing lungs, experts said. Dr. John McQueston, a pediatric pulmonologist who works for Randall Children's Hospital in Portland and serves satellite clinics in some of the hardest hit regions in the state, predicted a spike in asthma-related illness. ""I would not be surprised if six months from now, when children have problems with asthma, I'll ask their parents, 'When did it start?' And they'll answer, 'It happened right after the fires,'"" he said.

In recent days, Dr. McQueston has dealt with a handful of other cases involving asthmatic children living just downwind from fires; they had intensified symptoms but had been treated at home with medication. Dr. McQueston said there might well be more acute issues in the region if not for the coronavirus pandemic, which was already keeping so many children at home and less exposed to infection. In Oroville, Calif., near some of the state's worst fires, Dr. Sidharth Bagga, a pulmonary critical care specialist for children and adults, said he and his colleagues were receiving ""drastically more phone calls"" about lung health for people of all ages. He's particularly concerned about the children, though, because many seem to be playing outside still. ""My fear is parents don't realize it is unhealthy,"" he said, and that the smoke can act as a ""trigger"" for long-term respiratory challenges. ""We're creating the next generation of smoke or respiratory cripples by letting them be exposed to this without realizing this is what is actually happening,"" Dr. Bagga said. To support this concern, he estimates that 5 to 10 percent of patients he sees regularly and who come in with new asthma or respiratory distress say they first felt symptoms after a fire. Longstanding evidence from more polluted nations shows the risks of unhealthy air to developing lungs, with one estimate showing that, worldwide, 237,000 children under age 5 died in 2015 from asthma and other conditions associated with air pollution, mostly in Asia and Africa.

The research on wildfires is more recent, reflecting the fact that industrial pollution has been considered more common. But researchers say the differences might not be so pronounced in that the wildfire air carries tiny particulates that threaten lungs from scorched trees, cars, homes and businesses and industrial areas, Dr. MacDonald said. ""It could be pretty bad if man-made objects are being burned."" If the science remains murky, the bottom line seems plain, experts said. ""In the absence of a compelling reason, it's best to keep the kids at home,"" said Dr. David Cornfield, chief of pulmonary, asthma, and science medicine at Stanford Children's Health. He was involved in cases of two children with severe asthma who died after exposure to smoke from wildfires, one in 2016 and one in 2013. Air quality is measured by the density of pollutants; when a widely used index of air quality developed by the E.P.A. reads below 50, conditions are considered safe. That index has well exceeded 400 in the areas around Portland, causing them to be labeled ""hazardous"" and an ""emergency situation,"" while the levels in the San Francisco Bay Area, hovering between 200 and 300, are ""very unhealthy."" Dr. Cornfield said he didn't want to be too prescriptive about what precise level should keep children inside but said a decent guideline is to cease outdoor activity at 100. Above 150, he said, ""you don't really want to have people sitting outside."" That puts a major crimp in school reopening plans, which are predicated on keeping windows open, having ventilation, even holding outdoor classes to stanch the spread of the coronavirus. That, too, preys on the lungs, so administrators are now caught between wildfires that would call for tightly insulated schools and the threat of the virus, which argues for open air.

Now, the air outside has smelled ""like a campfire,"" Ms. Murphy said, and thanks to the aging windows in their fixer-upper home in the Portland suburb of Tigard, they ""are getting lots of smoke in the house."" For the last few days, Cora hasn't seemed like her usual chipper self, her parents said. She has been sleeping in later than usual and falling asleep at night without a fight. ""Usually at bed time, when I go to lay down with her, she's flapping all over the place,"" her mother said. ""But yesterday, she laid down next to me and went right to sleep."" It has left Cora's parents to wonder if lethargy could be tied to the fires and the asthma, but so far Ms. Murphy said she was trying not to panic. Ms. Murphy said she would take the girl to the doctor if she developed pronounced symptoms. The couple also has a 2-year-old son, Benjamin, who does not have asthma and has clamored to go outside, to no avail. ""We bought a swing set during Covid so they could go outside,"" said the children's father, Mr. Jensen. ""Now they can't go into the backyard."" During fires in 2008, researchers in Northern California allowed infant rhesus macaque monkeys to be exposed to 10 days of wildfire smoke and compared their lung function at the time and in the years that followed with the lung function of a group of rhesus monkeys that had not been exposed to the smoke.

Research shows that human children face challenges, too, from pollution over all and wildfire. A study of a fire that burned 4,200 acres in San Diego in 2017 -- a blaze far smaller than the ones in the West today -- found sharp increases in emergency room visits -- 16 excess visits per day -- at a children's hospital in the region during a span of around 10 days during the fire. A study of hospital visits during and just after wildfires in San Diego in 2007 found a 136 percent increase in asthma-related emergency-room visits for children ages 4 and under. The study concluded: ""Young children appear at highest risk for respiratory problems during a wildfire, which is cause for particular concern because of the potential for long-term harm to children's lung development."" Children have been less well studied than adults but experts said the challenges of youth are very likely intensified by at least three key differences: children's lungs remain in development, which means their immune systems may be altered; their airways are narrower; and they simply breathe more often and faster. That leads to more toxic intake for their body mass. ""Infant respiration may be double or triple adults,"" said Dr. Cornfield of Stanford. At the particularly high levels of smoke in places like Portland, Dr. Cornfield said, at the least, families should consider getting an air filter or using air conditioning to the clear the air inside. In a perfect world, he would urge stronger measures, at least for the short term. ""I honestly think that if there's the potential to relocate to a less challenged environment, one should really do that,"" he said. ""Most people are not so blessed with a plethora of options.""","The wildfires blazing in the West could hinder developing lungs, worsen asthma and even lead to the condition in those who don't have it but are genetically disposed to it.",751bff78-1037-5a00-833a-da2a7ea86556,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/18/science/18FIRES-KIDS1/18FIRES-KIDS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=dfd0befef876a1f4224470a5078834e52bacaf767ae01117451efaedfb0ba411&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rachel Murphy, of Portland, Ore., delivered her 5-year-old daughter Cora's daily asthma treatment.

""Bunuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles"" is an animated film about the making of ""Las Hurdes"" (""Land Without Bread""), Luis Bunuel's almost grotesquely frank but ultimately compassionate 1933 short documentary about one of Spain's most economically deprived regions.

But as it happens, this movie, directed by Salvador Simo from a script he wrote with Eligio R. Montero, doesn't ever pitch itself as a novelty. Its fantastical visions are restricted to those of Bunuel's own anxiety-steeped dreams. O.K., there are a couple of shots in which Bunuel is dressed as a nun. But the Surrealist provocateur apparently liked to do that for real in the early days.

The movie takes up with the filmmaker as his second collaboration with Salvador Dali, ""L'Age d'Or,"" becomes a sufficient succes de scandale in Paris to get him blackballed by the French film industry. He's intrigued by a documentarian acquaintance who wants him to put his artistic money where his mouth is with respect to changing the world. Soon Bunuel heads to northern Spain, near the border of Portugal, to shoot in mountain villages where the people seem permanently malnourished.",The film explores the making of the director Luis Buñuel's 1933 documentary.,6309b068-35bf-5fec-8676-61ba025cbadf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/15/arts/15bunuel/15bunuel-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=d3b6ff6229a9f538ed99f4f8883f130df62b3f7d96125701b1ddb0bbb33b2f6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Buñuel in the Labyrinth of the Turtles"" is directed by Salvador Simó.",6309b068-35bf-5fec-8676-61ba025cbadf,N24News/imgs/6309b068-35bf-5fec-8676-61ba025cbadf.jpg,5
Technology,How the Promise of a $120 Billion Uber I.P.O. Evaporated,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/15/technology/uber-ipo-price.html,"Uber's top executives, including the chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, and the chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, middle, gathered at the New York Stock Exchange last week for the company's I.P.O.

Last September, Uber's top executives were pitched by some of Wall Street's biggest banks, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. The bankers' presentations calculated Uber's valuation almost identically, hovering around one particular number: $120 billion. That was the figure the bankers said they could convince investors Uber was worth when it listed its shares on the stock market, according to three people with knowledge of the talks. Uber's chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, and chief financial officer, Nelson Chai, listened and discussed the presentations, these people said. Then they hired Morgan Stanley as lead underwriter, along with Goldman Sachs and others, to take the company public -- and to effectively make the $120 billion valuation a reality. Nine months later, Uber is worth about half that figure. The ride-hailing firm went public last week at $45 a share and has since dropped to around $41, pegging Uber's market capitalization at $69 billion -- and officially crowning it as the stock market debut that lost more in dollar terms than any other American initial public offering since 1975.

How Uber's offering turned into what some are now openly calling a ""train wreck"" began with the $120 billion number that the bankers floated. The figure leaked last year, whipping up a frenzy over how Uber could soon become the biggest American company to list on an American stock exchange -- larger even than Facebook, which went public in 2012 at a whopping $104 billion valuation. But for Mr. Khosrowshahi and Mr. Chai, the $120 billion number turned Uber's I.P.O. process into an exercise in managing expectations. Some large investors who already owned Uber shares at cheaper prices pushed back against buying more of the stock at such a lofty number, said people familiar with the matter. Their appetite for Uber was dampened further by the company's deep losses and slowing growth in regions like Latin America. And Uber had to contend with unforeseen factors, including fraying trade talks with China that spooked the stock market in the same week that the company decided to go public.

The result has created a host of pointed questions for all involved in Uber's I.P.O., from Mr. Khosrowshahi and Mr. Chai to the underwriters at Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America. While Uber raised $8.1 billion from its offering and reaped billions of dollars in returns for its early investors and founders, what should have been a climactic moment for a transportation colossus instead became an embarrassment. The extent of the fallout may not be clear for a while, and it is too early to judge how Uber will ultimately fare in the public markets. But as many other tech-related companies aim to go public this year, including the food-delivery company Postmates and the real-estate firm WeWork, they will have to contend with whether Uber has squelched what had been a red-hot I.P.O. market.

""The $69 billion market cap Uber had when the market closed today is a new reality,"" said Shawn Carolan, partner at Menlo Ventures, which invested early in the company. But he added that Uber's executives now had ""the opportunity to show us what they can do."" This account of Uber's I.P.O. was based on interviews with a dozen people involved in or briefed on the process. Many asked to remain anonymous because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Representatives from Uber, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. For years, Uber was an investor darling. As a privately held company, it gorged on capital from venture capital firms like Benchmark and GV, mutual fund firms like Fidelity Investments, and companies like SoftBank. Its private valuation shot up from $60 million in 2011 to $76 billion by August. Mr. Khosrowshahi, who became chief executive in late 2017, was recruited partly to steer Uber through a successful I.P.O. Uber's board agreed to pay him $45 million in cash and restricted stock -- and set an unusually specific valuation target for an additional bonus. In a provision in Mr. Khosrowshahi's compensation agreement, which was revealed in the company's I.P.O. prospectus, the board said that if Uber was valued in the public market at $120 billion or more for at least three months in the next five years, he would receive a payout of $80 million to $100 million.

That provision set something of a goal for Uber, which the investment bankers who were hired to take the company public also gravitated toward. Within weeks of the banks' presentations on the $120 billion, that number leaked, leading to giddy speculation in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street that Uber's offering could usher in a golden era of wealth. By December, Uber's I.P.O. team was set. At the company, Mr. Chai, a former chief financial officer at Merrill Lynch, was charged with leading the public offering. At Morgan Stanley, Michael Grimes, the firm's star tech banker, was the point person, assisted by Kate Claassen, head of internet banking. Goldman Sachs's team was led by Gregg Lemkau, Kim Posnett and David Ludwig. Bank of America's was headed by Neil Kell and Ric Spencer.

Almost immediately, the setbacks began, starting with Uber's business. Its once-meteoric growth rate was slowing as its geographic expansion appeared to be running out of room and as competitors continued springing up across the world. One growth headache was connected to Uber's biggest investor, SoftBank. The Japanese company, which has a $100 billion Vision Fund that it uses to invest in all manner of companies, has poured capital into technology start-ups including Didi Chuxing, China's biggest ride-hailing company, and 99, a transportation start-up in Latin America. In January 2018, Didi agreed to acquire 99. Both SoftBank and Didi also started directing funds toward pushing deeper into Latin America; SoftBank eventually created a $5 billion fund earmarked specifically for investing in Latin American companies. For Uber, the timing was terrible. The region was one of its most promising growth areas, and its competition had ramped up. By this February, the damage in Latin America had begun showing up in Uber's results in the form of slowing growth.

Some investors were also resisting because they had earlier invested in Uber at cheaper prices. Since its founding in 2009, Uber has taken in more than $10 billion from mutual fund firms, private equity investors and others, meaning that its stock was already widely held among those institutions that traditionally buy shares in an I.P.O. So the I.P.O. essentially became an exercise in getting existing investors to purchase more shares -- a tough sell, especially at a higher price. In March, another problem cropped up. Uber's rival in North America, Lyft, went public and promptly fell below its offering price on its second day of trading. Investors appeared skeptical about whether Lyft could make money, setting a troublesome precedent for Uber. By the time Uber made its I.P.O. prospectus available in April, it had already told some existing investors that its offering could value it at up to $100 billion -- down from the initial $120 billion. Inside Uber, two people familiar with the deliberations said the company's board was also not fully briefed on how Mr. Khosrowshahi and other executives planned to pitch the firm to investors in what is known as a ""roadshow."" Only a smaller group of board members, who were part of a pricing committee -- including Mr. Khosrowshahi, Ronald Sugar, who is also Uber's chairman, and David Trujillo of TPG -- focused on the I.P.O., these people said.

The company soon hit other obstacles. President Trump tweeted this month that he wanted to raise tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods, unsettling global stock markets. The day before Uber priced its I.P.O., Lyft reported a $1.14 billion loss for its first quarter, renewing questions about the health of ride-hailing businesses. Uber's executives, board and bankers discussed the final pricing of the stock sale on May 9. Several board members pushed for a price at the higher end of the $44- to $50-a-share range, said the people briefed on the situation. But Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs and others agreed that it needed to be lower, they said. The list of orders from potential investors, known in Wall Street jargon as the ""book,"" showed that the most desirable investors -- the big asset managers who were most likely to hold on to the shares, even in tough times -- were interested only in the lower price. That evening, Mr. Khosrowshahi and his management team gathered in Manhattan at Daniel, a Michelin-star restaurant a few blocks east of Central Park, at a ""pricing dinner"" hosted by Morgan Stanley. The mood was upbeat, according to two people familiar with the evening. But the next morning, that mood had changed. Uber executives arrived at the New York Stock Exchange, where the company was listing its shares. Before the first trade, monitors that lined the exchange floor displayed how Uber's stock was likely to fall -- flashing up $45, $44, before finally opening at $42. The chatter quieted. The rest of the day was little better. Uber's stock never rose close to its $45 offering price. As the so-called stabilization agent, charged with helping trading in Uber stock, Morgan Stanley made some moves to support the shares, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Yet by the end of the day, while the S&P 500 index closed up, Uber's stock remained down. On Wednesday, Uber closed at $41.29, more than 8 percent below its offering price.",Uber's offering was supposed to be a crowning moment for the ride-hailing company. But it suffered setback after setback and ultimately resulted in pointed questions for all involved.,f616bd42-df61-548b-8aaa-6b32adf8f943,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/business/00uber2/00uber2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3f077a23fc2da182a815287cba927af98d369d532fcb499a6ebfdcf33b4a760f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Uber signage decorated the exterior of the New York Stock Market last week.,f616bd42-df61-548b-8aaa-6b32adf8f943,N24News/imgs/f616bd42-df61-548b-8aaa-6b32adf8f943.jpg,20
Real Estate,The Torment of High-End Decorators,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/02/realestate/the-torment-of-high-end-decorators.html,"LISTED 

YES, real estate is ultimately about location and price. But at the high end, marketing counts for a lot, too. Developers hire starchitects to design their buildings. They sign up top-shelf firms to manage their gyms and other amenities. And they pack kitchens and baths with all the of-the-moment buzzwords and brands. Still not impressed? Then a name-drop-worthy interior decorator can add cachet. When I first toured Steven Klar's triplex penthouse at CitySpire in July, which he is listing for $100 million, he proudly noted that the Chilean-born decorator Juan Pablo Molyneux had designed the apartment some 18 years ago. It turns out that Mr. Molyneux, who never saw the completed apartment until he saw newspaper stories about the listing a few weeks ago, is not so proud of the end result.

Mr. Molyneux reached out to me from Paris recently and downplayed his involvement in the classical decoration of the 8,000-square-foot octagonal apartment. He noted he had prepared only the original plans for the layout of the residence, but then was dropped from the project by Mr. Klar before he could implement his vision. The photos of the apartment Mr. Molyneux saw circulating on the Internet did not look like his work, he said. ""The way he did the curtains, the moldings, the type of furniture, it is not me,"" Mr. Molyneux said. ""To a point where it is almost funny.""

He said he received phone calls ""from all over the world"" and the reaction was not good. ""They say it is a little gaudy and they are so happy that I changed my style,"" said Mr. Molyneux, 65. Mr. Klar clarified this week that Mr. Molyneux had worked for eight or nine months on the project. After the decorator finished the plans, Mr. Klar, a Long Island real estate developer, decided to implement them on his own, including picking out the furniture on several trips to Europe. He spent two and a half years decorating the penthouse from raw space.

The developer shrugged off suggestions that he had tried to unfairly exploit Mr. Molyneux's involvement to help market the apartment. In fact, Mr. Klar insisted that he hewed almost religiously to the decorator's plans, down to the style of curtains, use of marble and columns -- even, in one case, the exact placement of a painting in his office. ""We used his decorating designs totally,"" Mr. Klar said. ""It was all his plans."" To emphasize his point, Mr. Klar invited me back to the penthouse this week. He sat me down and showed me the 11 pages of final plans Mr. Molyneux had developed. They seemed to detail much of what I saw. ""These columns are exactly what he specified; they are in the exact place he specified,"" Mr. Klar said as we walked through the marbled foyer that he said represented Mr. Molyneux's ""trademark"" design style. In the formal dining room, where a crystal chandelier Mr. Klar purchased at auction(and which Mr. Molyneux didn't like) hung above a French dining table (which the decorator also didn't approve of), I discovered one reason for the two men's misunderstanding.

A gold hue around the coffered ceiling that appears in a photo of the room was not the result of gilding, as the decorator had feared. It was instead the result of cove lighting that must have been turned on when the photos were taken. The differences, notwithstanding furniture and colors, seemed few. Mr. Klar decided not to use wood paneling in his conference room, as the plans had called for, and he didn't use 17th century chestnut wood from France for the Versailles-like flooring in the living and dining rooms, as Mr. Molyneux had wanted (Mr. Klar said that would have taken a year). Instead, he used wood from a barn in Kentucky that he had torn down.

Mr. Klar's only regret, he said, was never having invited Mr. Molyneux up for cocktails to see the finished apartment. But a few days before news broke of his $100 million listing, Mr. Klar did place a courtesy call to the decorator, who splits his time between Paris and New York. Mr. Molyneux said he did not object to being mentioned in the article. Then he saw the pictures of the listing in Le Figaro, the French newspaper. ""I never thought that this horror would be published and then everybody would blame me for having done it,"" he said. It was at this point that I thought, thou doth protest too much, Mr. Molyneux. But then I spoke with Pamela Durante, the president of the New York Metro chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers, who noted that the situation with Mr. Molyneux is all too common. Decorators, even famous ones, are often not given the chance by owners to realize their vision, usually because the owners are trying to save time or money. To the untrained eye, the differences in style might appear minimal, but to a decorator they can be quite large.

""To take your concept and think that they can actually pull it through is pretty bizarre and it is highly unlikely that anybody would have that ability, especially with a high-profile designer,"" she said. This design flap comes as Mr. Klar's penthouse, listed for $100 million, the highest in the city, has become the subject of much curiosity -- and some derision -- in the real estate community. Stories about the listing have appeared around the world. CNN taped a tour of the apartment with Howard Lorber, chairman of Prudential Douglas Elliman, which has the listing.","Now that Steven Klar has put his penthouse in Midtown Manhattan on the market, he and his decorator, Juan Pablo Molyneux, are at odds over the final look of the apartment.",fe4e8831-9cec-5085-89fc-904847e9b437,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/09/02/realestate/02DEAL1_SPAN/02DEAL1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=973fd49542220ab8ccff596ffb723dd64724a69eff2c27ef528e284b7e454dad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"LISTED  Now that Steven Klar has put his penthouse in Midtown Manhattan on the market, he and his decorator, Juan Pablo Molyneux, are at odds over the final look of the apartment.",fe4e8831-9cec-5085-89fc-904847e9b437,N24News/imgs/fe4e8831-9cec-5085-89fc-904847e9b437.jpg,7
Automobiles,"Compressing Gas for a Cheaper, Simpler Hybrid",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/automobiles/compressing-gas-for-a-cheaper-simpler-hybrid.html,"REVEALED A display model at the Peugeot Citroen technical center in France was created to show the position of the Hybrid Air system's components.

PARIS -- What's that car that just breezed past? It's a Hybrid Air -- an experimental vehicle that the French automaker PSA Peugeot Citroen has been trumpeting as an exemplar of energy efficiency. While some skeptics wonder if the Hybrid Air is truly a breakthrough technology, the Peugeot and Citroen research cars powered by it may prove to be some of the more intriguing models on display this week at the Geneva motor show. The show opens on Tuesday for two days of press previews and runs through March 17. Peugeot says a compact model like a Citroen C3 equipped with the technology, which combines hydraulic drive with a conventional gasoline engine, will get about 81 miles per gallon in city driving. That would be significantly better than existing gasoline-electric hybrids like the Toyota Prius can achieve in stop-and-go traffic. PSA Peugeot Citroen, the second-biggest carmaker in Europe, after Volkswagen, says it plans to begin rolling out Hybrid Air cars by 2015 or 2016. Like a Prius, the Hybrid Air system recovers energy each time the driver brakes or decelerates. But instead of capturing the kinetic energy of the slowing car with a generator that charges a battery, as in the Prius, the Hybrid Air system uses a reversible hydraulic pump. The pump compresses nitrogen gas in what looks like an oversize scuba tank that also contains hydraulic fluid; the next time the driver presses the accelerator, the compressed gas pushes the hydraulic fluid, in the manner of a syringe, through a gearbox to turn the wheels.

The amount of energy stored in the nitrogen tank is small -- equivalent to about five teaspoons of gasoline. While that is only enough to power the car a few hundred yards until the gasoline engine takes over again, when repeated over the course of a day of city driving, those extra teaspoons of energy add up to big improvement in mileage, Peugeot says. The idea of using so-called hybrid hydraulics to power a car has been around for years. Peugeot prefers to call its system ""hybrid air"" technology because the energy is stored by compressing nitrogen gas rather than pressurizing hydraulic fluid. In the United States, Chrysler and Ford Motor have each studied the approach, and the Environmental Protection Agency has encouraged the research. The United Parcel Service has added several dozen hybrid hydraulic delivery vans to its alternative-fuel fleet. Other companies are applying the technology to garbage trucks, which, like U.P.S. vans, are big, make frequent stops and can benefit from recovering energy otherwise wasted in heat generated by the brakes. The Indian automaker Tata has promised to produce a car powered solely by compressed air, although that uses a different technology, developed by Motor Development International. The 200-member Hybrid Air team, led by Karim Mokaddem, a Peugeot engineer, appears to be moving the fastest of any at a global automaker to bring this alternative hybrid technology to production.

When the car is ready for the market, Peugeot plans to price it at about $26,000. Mr. Mokaddem said that the pricing was meant to make the Hybrid Air a viable option in emerging markets like China and India, where most gasoline-electric hybrids were expensive and too complex for local service and repair operations. Peugeot says it can undercut existing hybrids on price because its car does not require an expensive battery and electric motor, like a Prius, although the Hybrid Air does employ a standard car battery. The hydraulic system also adds about 220 pounds to the weight of a conventional Citroen or Peugeot. And because of the heat generated by the energy transfer process, the engineers have had to adapt the car's cooling system. The most obvious difference between the prototype Hybrid Air and an ordinary car is the presence of two pressure tanks and a special gearbox that manages the energy handoffs between the hydraulics and the 1.2-liter standard gasoline engine. The system's designers say the setup left them room to keep a standard-size trunk and gasoline tank. The accumulator, or nitrogen pressure tank, is about four feet long, with a volume of 20 liters, or about five gallons, and a maximum pressure of about 3,600 pounds per square inch. Any rupture in a pressurized steel tank could send metal flying, of course, but the design team says it has shielded against that by installing the tank under the floorboards and adding emergency release valves. They also note that nitrogen gas, which constitutes nearly 80 percent of the air we breathe, is not flammable. The Hybrid Air's mechanical components are ""simple, robust and mechanical,"" Mr. Mokaddem said, noting that software manages the system's complexities. ""All you have to do is drive the car.""

Though Peugeot runs the risk of overpromising the potential of the Hybrid Air technology, the company urgently needs a hit product. Last month it reported a 2012 net loss of $6.6 billion in a dismal European market. A loose alliance with General Motors, under which G.M. last year bought a 7 percent stake in the French company, has yielded few results. Mr. Mokaddem acknowledged that bringing the Hybrid Air to market would require overcoming a ""key challenge"" in adapting the hydraulic parts, which were used mainly in applications like elevators, tractors and aircraft, and producing them in volume. Robert Bosch, the German auto parts giant, which is providing the hydraulics and electronics for the project, has sounded even more cautious. Bernd Bohr, chairman of Bosch's automotive group, said at a January news conference in Paris that ""more work will have to be done before these cars find the mass market."" Asked recently for more detail, a Bosch spokesman, Udo Rugheimer, cited a need for ""fine tuning"" critical components, including brakes and hydraulic units, but declined to comment further. Even so, Pascal Higelin, a professor of engineering at the Universite d'Orleans who is developing cars using related technology but is not associated with the Hybrid Air project, said Peugeot's approach looked promising. The gains in gas mileage the company is claiming are in line with simulations run by his own team, Mr. Higelin said. Market acceptance may present a bigger hurdle than the technology challenges. Ferdinand Dudenhoffer, director of the Center for Automotive Research at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Duisburg, Germany, said that the Peugeot idea ""looked interesting"" but that he was skeptical whether it could overcome the big head start that hybrid electric vehicles have in the market. Even if Hybrid Air proves to be a superior technology, Peugeot could have trouble getting traction unless it can show ""a tremendous cost advantage,"" Mr. Dudenhoffer said. ""We already have one company that is successful in the car market with hybrids,"" he said. ""It's called Toyota.""","The Hybrid Air, which combines hydraulic drive with a conventional gasoline engine, is an experimental vehicle that PSA Peugeot Citroën says is an exemplar of energy efficiency.",faca6362-ff3f-54f0-bae6-4b3660e56725,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/03/03/automobiles/Compress1/Compress1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=381&w=600&s=84051960b99d1111c358eeaea80bd4b129ddffabddd3ffa4e58c12c539935f9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,REVEALED A display model at the Peugeot Citroën technical center in France was created to show the position of the Hybrid Air system's components.,faca6362-ff3f-54f0-bae6-4b3660e56725,N24News/imgs/faca6362-ff3f-54f0-bae6-4b3660e56725.jpg,23
Television,"'The Americans' Season 6, Episode 1 Recap: The Coldest War",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/arts/television/the-americans-dead-hand-recap.html,"It's one thing when your marriage is threatened because you never see each other and one partner feels like she's doing all the work. It's another thing when your marriage is threatened because someone flies over from Moscow to tell the husband that he may need to kill his wife. Welcome back, comrades, for the sixth and last season of ""The Americans,"" which began Wednesday night on FX with a brisk episode called ""Dead Hand"" that deftly caught us up and set the show's end game in motion. Philip and Elizabeth Jennings, the Soviet spies who live in our midst (if you happen to live in the D.C. metro area) are now officially on opposite sides of the Cold War, geopolitically and in the kitchen. The season picks up in the fall of 1987, three years after the Season 5 finale, with the contentious nomination of Robert Bork to the Supreme Court (which was rejected on Oct. 23) in the news and a Washington summit meeting between Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev nine weeks away. (It took place Dec. 8-10.) That would put the biggest news event of the fall, the 1987 market crash, a few weeks off (Black Monday was Oct. 19). It's hard to imagine the Jenningses won't have something to say about that capitalist meltdown, and its effects on the travel business. The strongest thing saying 1987 is Crowded House's elegiac ballad ""Don't Dream It's Over"" -- with its references to a battle ahead and building walls between us -- which was omnipresent on American radio (remember that?) in the spring and summer of the year. It plays over a wordless opening montage that establishes Philip's and Elizabeth's realities.

Philip has indeed quit the spy business and is a happy bourgeois, opening the power roof of his comfy car and lecturing his travel-agency employees on how to have the human touch. He appears to have plenty of free time, as a retired assassin and empty nester -- Paige is in college nearby and Henry is at the private school in New Hampshire, where he's a hard-nosed hockey player with a gaggle of screaming female fans. Elizabeth, on the other hand, is working harder than ever -- running a honey-pot sting on one hapless American, and infiltrating the home of another by working as a health aide for his wife. The montage is a greatest-hits collection of Elizabeth personas: the frumpy glasses-and-perm working woman, the longhaired seductress, the action-figure operative in her baseball cap. The primary message, driven home throughout the episode, is that Elizabeth is exhausted, and resentful of Philip's new freedom. (He has time to drive up to New England to watch Henry play and to make small talk with an attractive hockey mom.) No matter how depressed and rumpled Elizabeth gets, though, Moscow does not believe in tears, a point brought home a bit literally when we cut to a scene of her, Paige and Claudia watching ""Moscow Does Not Believe in Tears,"" the 1980 film that was a combination of weepy Hollywood-style women's picture and Soviet propaganda. (The Washington-based warriors of socialism are mostly women now -- these three, plus Marilyn. But Norm is still around, looking unpleased.) Paige is now operational, but she's still being shielded from the nasty stuff that her mother is so good at. When a young Navy security guard hits on Paige and possibly compromises her cover, Elizabeth says it's no big deal, then tracks the guy down and shivs him in the neck. (It's the only violent moment in an otherwise quiet episode.) In her defense, he was pretty creepy, having tried to blackmail Paige into a date by keeping her college I.D. From the vantage point of 2018, it couldn't help registering as a #MeToo moment. Sex, surveillance, murder AND a sudden trip to Mexico City, where Elizabeth is sent by Claudia to meet with a hard-line, anti-perestroika Soviet general. He tells her that the Soviets have developed a system called Dead Hand that will automatically nuke the United States should an American first strike wipe out the Soviet command structure. No human touch there. She's to monitor a member of the Soviet summit team and, if she learns that Gorbachev is planning to trade away Dead Hand in exchange for an end to the Star Wars missile-defense program, she's to pass it along. Gorbachev will be dead within 24 hours.

Back in Moscow, Arkady, now deputy director of Directorate S -- the KGB branch that runs ""illegals"" like Elizabeth and Philip -- seeks out Oleg, who's still working at his father's Ministry of Transportation. (He's also married and has a baby son.) The pro-Gorbachev Arkady knows about Elizabeth's meeting, and wants to learn what her mission is. So he leans on Oleg to go to Washington and contact Philip -- a very dangerous proposition for the now civilian Oleg -- and ask him to spy on his own wife. And, if need be, ""to stop her."" Oleg, always the good soldier, makes the trip despite his wife's protests, and he and Philip fall right back into their spying ways -- a slash of chalk on a mailbox, which Philip notices even after three years out of the game; an address left in a cinder bock; a nighttime meeting in a park. Ah, the good stuff. ""She's my wife,"" Philip says, but Oleg plays the patriotism card -- the future of their country is being decided right now. (He has no idea how right he is.) Philip waits up for Elizabeth, who gets home late after murdering the sailor. ""I have to talk to you,"" he says, but she's exhausted and angry and cuts him off. ""I know you love to talk,"" she says, a little dagger of contempt aimed at the America-loving, EST-attending, cowboy-line-dancing stranger he's become. And then she walks upstairs without another word. What would he have said to her? And what was Elizabeth thinking in the last shot, as she looked at the locket containing the cyanide pill she's been issued now that she knows about Dead Hand? There are no answers, but your speculation is encouraged in the comments.
* Stan and Renee, and the Aderholts, were seen briefly having dinner with the Jenningses at Stan's house. The is-she-or-isn't-she question remains hanging in the air over Renee, and maybe it's a little past it's expiration date. We see her fishing for information about ""the couple"" that Dennis Aderholt and Stan continue to investigate, while Elizabeth, half of the couple, tries to listen in.
* With the current season of ""Homeland"" still in progress, Costa Ronin is playing two sides of Russian foreign policy at once. As Oleg in ""The Americans"" he's a Soviet progressive opposed to the entrenched hawks in the KGB. As Yevgeny Gromov in ""Homeland"" he's a KGB hawk, three decades later, trying to bring down an American president.
* We've managed to make just a passing mention of the line-dancing scene, which harked back to those cowboy boots Philip had his eye on in the pilot. Does Philip do this every week? The point seemed to be how comfortable and adept he was -- he had the boots, and he knew the steps better than most of the Americans around him. Yes, we get it, he's a trained chameleon, and how do we -- or he -- distinguish between his fitting into America and pretending to fit into America.
* The most prominent new characters in the episode were the Haskards, played by Scott Cohen and Miriam Shor. He's an American arms negotiator Elizabeth is surveilling and she's the bedridden artist Elizabeth is caring for. Her paintings, by the Brooklyn artist Alyssa Monks, are striking, and as Alexis Soloski detailed in this article, they fit the story -- Elizabeth found herself caught by an image of a faceless, nearly formless figure, like a human palimpsest.","It's three years later, and Philip and Elizabeth really are on opposite sides.",ec9ca17b-ec7e-5ecf-b7f7-4d48495fe1ee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/28/watching/28americans-recap/28americans-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a871e00f5d14b8ffaa9692707addcf4dfb8a9d278f40fb2549504d95bdc8b24f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Holly Taylor in ""The Americans.""",ec9ca17b-ec7e-5ecf-b7f7-4d48495fe1ee,N24News/imgs/ec9ca17b-ec7e-5ecf-b7f7-4d48495fe1ee.jpg,3
Media,"A.M.I., Tabloid Giant and Trump Ally, Expands Its Reach",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/business/media/american-media-inc-magazines.html,"American Media Inc., the country's largest tabloid publisher whose chairman is a close ally of President Trump, controls almost the entire supermarket checkout rack after new acquisitions announced on Friday. A.M.I. said it had bought In Touch, Life & Style, Closer and 10 other titles from Bauer Media, expanding a celebrity-news portfolio that already included The National Enquirer, Us Weekly, Globe, OK!, Star and Radar Online. The move gives the company, led by David J. Pecker, almost full ownership of the print gossip market, leaving People magazine, owned by the Meredith Corporation, as one of the only major glossy gossip titles not under Mr. Pecker's umbrella. (TMZ, the dominant gossip player online, has come under the ownership of AT&T with its purchase of Time Warner.) Mr. Pecker is a Bronx native and a longtime Trump friend. A former top executive of Mr. Trump's casino business sits on A.M.I.'s four-member board of directors. During the 2016 campaign, its flagship National Enquirer devoted glowing covers to Mr. Trump's triumphs, aggressively attacked his rivals and made its first-ever presidential endorsement.

A.M.I.'s move to buy 13 titles from Bauer Media, including several teen magazines, is particularly bold given that the company is under the most intense public and legal scrutiny it has faced in its history. Federal Election Commission officials are looking into whether it violated campaign finance laws when it effectively bought the silence during the 2016 campaign of a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, who said she had an affair with Mr. Trump years earlier. A.M.I. has denied any wrongdoing. Separately, federal investigators with the Southern District of New York are looking into its arrangement with Ms. McDougal as part of its broad investigation into the president's lawyer and fixer, Michael Cohen, and have asked for Mr. Cohen's communications with Mr. Pecker and his lieutenant, Dylan Howard.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Long known for having the power to make and break stars, A.M.I.'s magazines have impacted politicians and their campaigns as well. It reached its journalistic high point in 2007 when The National Enquirer broke the story that former Senator John Edwards of North Carolina had fathered a child with a woman who had worked for his campaign, and then concocted an elaborate ruse in which his top political aide publicly claimed to be the baby's father. But it has also gone out of its way to protect business partners and those known as ""Friends of Pecker,"" even when their behavior was textbook fodder for scandal sheet cover stories.

After the actresses Ashley Judd and Rose McGowan made veiled references to misconduct by Mr. Weinstein in 2015 and 2016 - which were followed by investigations into him by journalists at New York magazine, The New York Times and The New Yorker - Mr. Howard came to the aid of Mr. Weinstein, with whom A.M.I. had business ties. His help included dispatching reporters to find information that could undercut Mr. Weinstein's accusers, The Times reported in December. A.M.I.'s purchase of the rights to Ms. McDougal's story about Mr. Trump -- part of a $150,000 deal that also included rights to fitness-related commentaries that would run under her name -- was what is known as a ""catch and kill"" deal, known for the tabloid world practice of buying stories that are damaging to allies only to bury them. A.M.I., which also owns lifestyle brands including Men's Journal, Muscle & Fitness, Hers and Flex, has repeatedly restructured in the past decade. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, and reported up to $1 billion in debts at the time. It was acquired four years ago by two private equity funds.","The tabloid publisher added In Touch, Life & Style and Closer to a portfolio that already included The National Enquirer, Us Weekly and Star.",6f13630a-3833-5e87-afd1-2ea76526a821,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/16/business/16xp-magazines-2/16xp-magazines-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=604ba71cdf0ae211af411769741daa468ea71bd85e7f5bad1939db303bcdf86b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"American Media Inc.'s flagship, The National Enquirer, has devoted glowing covers to President Trump.",6f13630a-3833-5e87-afd1-2ea76526a821,N24News/imgs/6f13630a-3833-5e87-afd1-2ea76526a821.jpg,16
Science,Arming China's Terracotta Warriors — With Your Phone,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/29/science/china-terracotta-warriors-augmented-reality.html,"At the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia, a handful of terracotta warriors from ancient China will be on display and an augmented reality app will let viewers place digitally recreated weapons in their hands.

PHILADELPHIA -- Imagine pointing your phone at China's ancient terracotta warriors to arm them with spears and bows, weapons that disintegrated long ago. For many people, the Franklin Institute's new exhibition, ""Terracotta Warriors of the First Emperor,"" will be the only chance to see a small subset of the approximately 8,000 clay soldiers and other figures that were discovered beneath a Chinese persimmon orchard in 1974. Some 2,200 years ago, they were built by the emperor Qin Shihuangdi in a massive public works project that lasted about 30 years. While some of these 10 warriors have been exhibited elsewhere, the institute is enhancing the experience with augmented reality technology to digitally recreate weapons and other objects that were originally held by the statues. The original artifacts crumbled and vanished as earthen walls and roof timbers collapsed during the warriors' long occupancy of three underground pits.

Technology experts worked with curators to digitally recreate objects like swords and spears that were held by the warriors. They did the same with the two nonmilitary figures in the show - a civil official and a musician - to represent objects that they would have held or stood next to. The technology is available to museumgoers through an app that they can download to their smartphones when they book tickets or arrive at the museum. Visitors can activate the digital images of the warriors' weapons by holding their phones in front of a two-dimensional ""target"" that's fixed to the interpretive display with each statue. Once a ""missing"" object like a spear appears on the viewer's phone, it can be manipulated to allow the user to see features such as shape and color. Technologists ensured the historical accuracy of the images by drawing on the expertise of museum staff.

""The curators worked with the developers on what type of metal this would be, what type of wood this would have been, so it really takes you back in time to see the weapons as they would have been originally made,"" said Susan Poulton, the institute's chief digital officer. ""When you see the pits, you really don't see them really holding all their weaponry, and this gives you a chance to see how they would have stood in the original pit."" In coming weeks, the Institute will upgrade the technology so that visitors can activate the augmented reality simply by pointing their phones at the statues themselves.

Ms. Poulton said the adoption of technology recognizes that many museumgoers, especially millennials and their children, want to be able to use their phones to enhance the museum experience. ""It's not that they think it's a distraction,"" she said. ""They expect to be able to experience this exhibit through their phone. And that's only going to grow as millennials have kids. How do we meet the visitors where they are technologically instead of trying to bring them to where we want them to be?"" The process of discovery using technology mirrors the recreation of the warriors themselves, all of which were in pieces when they were found, broken by the deterioration of their underground home over two millenniums.

The exhibition, which also includes hundreds of associated artifacts from museums around China, aims to tell the story not only of how the emperor created his enormous retinue for the afterlife but how the figures were rebuilt despite the absence of any guide or template. ""They needed to sort the pieces of the armored officer from the pieces of the archer that might have been standing beside him, and they were all mixed together,"" said Karen Elinich, the exhibition's co-curator. ""This is a monumental feat of archaeology and conservation.""

Even though objects such as spears and swords had disappeared from the warriors' grasp long before they were unearthed, scholars have been able to infer what the figures would have been carrying by drawing conclusions based on rank and function, and by examining the position of the figures' hands, Ms. Elinich said. Archers, for example, would have held crossbows, while cavalrymen would have been made with one hand holding a horse's reins, leaving the other free to hold a spear. In each case, scholarship has been used to inform the creation of the digital images.","At an exhibit at the Franklin Institute, visitors will be able to use an app on their phones to see digital images of spears and arrows for the statues.",0dafc05b-0d26-5c4f-bedc-4cd73a941dd6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/28/science/03SCI-WARRIORS6/03SCI-WARRIORS6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=a3f774761ce90da97c01fd1394ffa3befb97d9ebc303125a50c77f16f1f9f52d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The curators say the embrace of this digital technology recognizes that museumgoers today, especially millennials and their children, want to use their phones to enhance the museum experience.",0dafc05b-0d26-5c4f-bedc-4cd73a941dd6,N24News/imgs/0dafc05b-0d26-5c4f-bedc-4cd73a941dd6.jpg,2
Automobiles,"In Sign of Strength, Audi Steps Up Investments",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/28/automobiles/in-sign-of-strength-audi-steps-up-investments.html,"FRANKFURT -- Audi, the luxury car unit of Volkswagen, said on Friday that it would spend more than it ever has on expansion and new models over the next four years, a demonstration of how Germany's high-end carmakers have retained their financial strength during a crisis that has devastated their European rivals.

Audi said it would invest 22 billion euros, or more than $30 billion, through 2018, a record for the company. Most of the money will be used to design new models and develop new technology like more fuel-efficient engines. The company will also expand its international production network as it strives to sell two million models annually by 2015, up from more than 1.5 million this year.

Audi and its German rivals BMW and Mercedes-Benz, a unit of Daimler, have suffered far less from the economic malaise in Europe that has pushed car sales to a 20-year low. As a result they have been able to continue expanding, in contrast to companies like Fiat of Italy, which has all but stopped introducing new cars under the Fiat brand.

While mass-market carmakers including Ford and General Motors' Opel unit have lost billions of dollars in Europe and have had to close factories, luxury German carmakers have been operating at close to full capacity as they serve demand in the United States and China. Even in Europe, German carmakers have had less drastic sales declines than mass-market car brands, in part because the economy in their home market has remained strong.","Audi, which like its German rivals has suffered less from the economic malaise in Europe than other carmakers, said it would spend more than $30 billion through 2018.",e6275af0-d8e1-59e3-aa29-0846e4a54619,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/12/28/business/28audi-span/28audi-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=338&w=600&s=8a6abd5b1c19c63a5164c7edef4dd90a3962fa0d36fd316ea39228b05451d982&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The 2014 Audi Q5 S.U.V.

Theater,Hugh Jackman to Star in 'Music Man' on Broadway,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/theater/hugh-jackman-the-music-man.html,"Hugh Jackman is returning to Broadway next year in a revival of ""The Music Man.""

Mr. Jackman teased the idea via Twitter on Tuesday, and on Wednesday the producer Scott Rudin announced a run, which he said would begin previews Sept. 9, 2020, and open on Oct. 22, 2020 at an unspecified Shubert theater.

Mr. Jackman, 50, has appeared on Broadway four times. In 2004, he won a Tony Award as best actor in a musical for ""The Boy from Oz,"" and in 2012 he was granted a special, noncompetitive, Tony for his professional and volunteer efforts in the Broadway community.

""The Music Man,"" with book, music and lyrics by Meredith Willson, first opened on Broadway in 1957. Mr. Jackman will play Harold Hill, a scam artist who pretends to be a musician and makes money selling instruments and uniforms to boys aspiring to be part of a band in River City, Iowa.

The original production won the 1958 Tony Award for best musical, besting ""West Side Story."" There was a brief revival at City Center in 1980 starring Dick Van Dyke, and a longer-lived revival, starring Craig Bierko, that opened in 2000.","The Tony-winning actor will play Harold Hill in a revival that includes members of the creative team behind the recent production of ""Hello, Dolly!""",ec9b2c7f-2f9f-5826-a7de-ff425b78ea70,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/14/arts/14musicman1/14musicman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b44b2d4d37b5d43b524bbf9e122fcec86a58ba99d923d740765e7212f10e8e84&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Hugh Jackman hosting the 2014 Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall.,ec9b2c7f-2f9f-5826-a7de-ff425b78ea70,N24News/imgs/ec9b2c7f-2f9f-5826-a7de-ff425b78ea70.jpg,10
Real Estate,9 Top (and Stubborn) Design Trends,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/realestate/9-top-and-stubborn-design-trends.html,"A central island and subway tile are so common in contemporary kitchens they have almost become invisible. It wasn't always that way.





Being confined to my home for the last two months has led me to think deeply about subway tile. It neatly covers my kitchen backsplash, and very possibly yours, but do its origins really lie in the subways? Why would that environment be anyone's inspiration? And why is it so crazily popular now? Which leads me to kitchen islands. All of the Zillow listings I read for personal and professional reasons point them out, but when did they become a thing? And why does the director Nancy Meyers have two? Macrame? Moroccan carpets? Fiddle-leaf figs? Why have they popped up everywhere? Having some extra time on my hands, I decided to look a little closer at these and other interior decor trends. After combing through magazines and blogs that make a habit of spotting them, I compiled a list of nine -- the number was arbitrary -- and confirmed their relevance with Google Trends data compiled over the last five years. To make absolutely sure my choices weren't fluky, I checked the number of hashtag mentions each received on Instagram. (After all that, I realized I could have just deconstructed a Pottery Barn catalog and had much the same results.)

A decade ago, macrame, the ancient art of knotting threads into textiles, was still a punchline for jokes about the Age of Aquarius. The misplaced energies of amateur makers seeking authenticity with handiwork made for an easy laugh. No one is laughing now that there has been an explosive craft revival, and a reawakening of respect for honest, unrefined -- OK, hairy -- textures and materials. Instagram currently has about 3.4 million macrame-related posts. Of those, 592,000 concern wall hangings, and 237,000 plant hangers. Maeve Pacheco, a fiber artist in Brooklyn, learned macrame from her mother, an architect who square-knotted plant hangers on weekends while Ms. Pacheco's father threw pots. After working as a carpenter, painter and sculptor on retail displays, Ms. Pacheco discovered that customers kept asking to buy the big macrame wall pieces, so about eight years ago, she began focusing on that. She continues working at a large scale, using chunky 1- and 2-inch cords she doubts were readily available in her mother's time. ""It's not all owls anymore, right?"" she said. ""The technique itself has been modernized, and I think people can appreciate it."" Ms. Pacheco was not alone in pointing out that macrame offers a textural respite from the slickness of computer screens, and has a wholesome, organic nature.

Rattan is a vine-like East Asian palm with a solid inner pith used for framing and a flexible skin that is woven. The result is sometimes described as ""wicker,"" though wicker is a construction method rather than a material and might involve willow or raffia. Kenneth Cobonpue, a Filipino designer who has worked for decades with the material, said it made its way to the West through the colonies, turning up in Parisian bistro seating and Victorian peacock chairs ""because rattan furniture was considered to be more hygienic than upholstered pieces."" In the United States, Cyrus Wakefield, a Boston grocer, founded a business in the 1850s that converted the waste material used for stabilizing oceangoing freight into baskets and furniture. In 1897, the Wakefield Rattan Company merged with its biggest competitor, Heywood Brothers, to form Heywood-Wakefield. When the rampant curlicues that satisfied Victorians' taste for organic decoration went out of fashion, the company abandoned rattan and made Art Deco-inspired pieces out of yellow birch wood. Far from disappearing, rattan shape-shifted into the early-to-midcentury streamlined furnishings of Paul Frankl and Gilbert Rohde. Then came the 1960s. Gypsy skirts, flowing hair and hallucinatory rock poster graphics repudiated the neat, boxy contours and conformity of postwar subdivisions. Victorian curlicues and exoticism were back. A discount store later to be called Pier 1 opened in San Mateo, Calif., in 1962, and went on to sell love beads, incense and imported bowl-shaped rattan papasan chairs. At the same time, rattan lounges continued to fill the poolside decks of privilege, symbols of a sun that never set on economic imperialism.

The love affair between millennials and their houseplants has been heating up to such a degree that Pinterest named the garden room -- an oxygen-spewing sanctuary in one's home -- among its 100 trends for 2020. Nothing about sheltering in a pandemic is cooling anyone's ardor for greenery, and the king of the potted jungle remains Ficus lyrata, better known as the fiddle-leaf fig. In 2016, writing in The New York Times, Steven Kurutz declared the sassy botanical, with its fat, glossy leaves, the plant of the decade, despite the fig's habit of dying at the slightest provocation. A native of western Africa that grows as tall as 50 feet out of doors, it now fills the neutral, white rooms of West Elm catalogs and real estate listings. Last count, it had 216,000 hashtags on Instagram. Ficus lyrata's celebrity and tetchiness can be traced back into the mists of the 20th century. It made the top eight houseplants list in a 1939 issue of Better Homes & Gardens because, the author, writing in the middle of the Depression, noted, ""it doesn't take up so much room nor require so large a pot."" This plant had one weakness, she went on, ""a tendency to drop its leaves unless given plenty of water."" In 1952, Britain's Country Life magazine reported a growing popularity in potted evergreens, including the fiddle-leaf fig. The trend reversed a longtime preference for cut flowers and was a source of alarm to those who associated potted plants with fusty Victorian ways.

White tile was a fixture in middle-class Victorian homes long before the New York City subway opened in 1904, covered in the stuff. Unlike fancier, colorful tiles applied to fireplace surrounds and hearths, glazed white tile appeared in high-traffic areas like kitchens and bathrooms, offering durable surfaces that made dirt conspicuous and were easy to clean. Transferring the same hygienic principles underground, the subway station designers Christopher Grant La Farge and George L. Heins created a huge, elaborate canvas for white field tile installed in a running bond pattern edged in coves and other trims. The three-by-six-inch rectangles had a distinctive look, with beveled surfaces and narrow grout lines. Though the color and material palettes (and even size range) have expanded, this is the hugely popular wall treatment (214,000 Instagram hashtags) we now call subway tile. When did that term appear? Nobody seems to know. Keith Bieneman is the owner and managing director of Heritage Tile, a company that does restoration work on New York's subway stations, using tile manufactured to the original standards. ""There was a resurgence in artisan tile making throughout the U.S."" in the 1990s, he said. ""People started focusing on the kitchen and started putting in high-end appliances and looking at backsplashes as art pieces as opposed to utilitarian surfaces."" Subway tile fulfilled aspirations for the authentic remodeling of many 20th-century homes (it had exploded in the 1920s when its manufacture and installation were standardized) and yet it looked timeless.

Dainty bulbs were immediately destined for non-holiday purposes, as well. In 1882, they were integrated into the costumes of fairies in a Savoy Theatre production of Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera ""Iolanthe."" The term ""fairy lights"" dates at least to this event, though some argue that it evolved naturally from ""fairy lamps,"" petite, domed candle holders that were popular in Victorian England. Jumping to today, one finds an early influencer in Patrick Townsend. In the late 1990s, Mr. Townsend, a New York industrial designer, moved into a big artist's loft on Canal Street and needed something splashy to brighten it. He went into the lighting shops that dominated the neighborhood at the time, bought lamp sockets and cords and strung them together. Necessity was the mother of this invention, but love improved it. Wanting to make a special Christmas present for his girlfriend, he tweaked the design so that the bulbs formed an attractive cluster and were sheathed in white nylon instead of cardboard sleeves. Mr. Townsend married the girlfriend, and the lamp evolved into a more elaborate chandelier called Orbit, but the principle was the same: naked wires and bulbs. ""I love the simplicity of it,"" he said. After adventures in mass production in China, his company is making the lamps by hand in Long Island City. This boosts the cost into the art-piece realm. His String10 design, with a cluster of bulbs at the bottom, for example, starts at $175. Or, for $24.99, you can buy IKEA's Blotsno string light, with 24 LEDs. In fact, there are many choices for string lights, and not all of them are simple. The bulbs come in huge varieties of shapes and colors and many have their own little shades. A company called Atomi makes a ""smart"" version that can be controlled by Alexa, or any Wi-Fi-enabled device to which you can download an app. Oddly, there is even a ""string light bulb"" -- a clear, bulbous glass vessel within which a tangle of string lights nest.

The decor choices of quarantined celebrities have become their own genre in this pandemic, and none has stirred more interest than the filmmaker Nancy Meyers's kitchen. Famous for the aspirational kitchens that gleam in her romantic comedies, Ms. Meyers, who lives in Los Angeles, shared a photograph of her own in an April 26 Instagram post. What most impressed her followers were the twin islands, almost exactly like those in her 2003 movie, ""Something's Gotta Give,"" starring Diane Keaton, Jack Nicholson and a Hamptons house. ""Well I cook at one and serve on the other one,"" Ms. Meyers told Vanity Fair, explaining that the nearby table where everyone eats was not in view. Not so long ago, a single kitchen island might have produced the same frisson. Today, there are more than 455,000 Instagram posts on the topic. According to Juliana Rowen Barton, a historian of modern architecture and design, the island emerged in the mid-20th century when kitchen walls began to dissolve with the postwar open floor plan. This transformation was part of a decades-long evolution of the kitchen from a tight, functional space, with a worktable, overseen by servants at the back of the Victorian home to a larger, more conspicuous area supervised by housewives and designed for greater sociability. ""Islands became increasingly popular because they allowed for more communication and movement between the kitchen and other parts of the home,"" Ms. Barton said. Some users chafed at the smells and sounds that poured out of open kitchens. ""They were not as functional as people thought and created stress between family members,"" Ms. Barton said. Nor could the enhanced dimensions, surfaces and appliances disguise the fact that women, though on display as gracious hostesses, still did most of the work.

The bar cart, a midcentury artifact, made its return about a decade ago, a few years after ""Mad Men"" showed us what an asset it could be. In you took the AMC series as your model, you parked the bar cart in your living room (or better yet, office) and visited it as frequently as a diabetic zebra at a watering hole. You learned that anything small and on wheels feels friendly and informal, even when it is a vehicle for bad behavior. Well, five years have passed since ""Mad Men"" ended, and the bar cart is still with us (150,000 Instagram posts). It turns out to be useful in so many un-louche ways. Bar carts can be plant stands and end tables. Magazine holders and unused corner fillers. You can even pull them up to your open-plan kitchen for emergency counter space when you have no other place to put the roast. ""To me, bar carts signify swagger. I think that's le mot juste,"" said Jonathan Adler, who began designing them 15 years ago, before Don Draper lurched onto the scene. ""If you see someone with a bar cart, you think they're fun. They make young people seem sophisticated and old people seem young.""

Nathan Ursch, a Moroccan carpet dealer in Brooklyn, guessed that anyone who bought a Dwell or Domino magazine in the last seven years has seen a Beni Ouarain carpet. ""They're in every issue."" The ivory wool rugs, with scrawled geometric motifs in dark grays, browns or blacks, are named for a confederation of nomadic Berber tribes in the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and have 53,300 Instagram hashtags. ""They bring a kind of rustic warmth to an environment that is different than a Turkish or Oriental carpet,"" said Mr. Ursch, who considers the Beni Ouarain a ""gateway"" Moroccan carpet. ""They contrast in a nice way with minimal modern furniture,"" as opposed to, say, jute, which just adds frost to the chill. If your Beni Ouarain carpet is authentic (many are not), it will probably be less than 100 years old, having been made for hard use as tent flooring. A woman will have woven it over an average period of two years, on a portable loom at most 8 feet wide.

It will probably tell the story of the weaver's fertility, Mr. Ursch said. ""The lozenges represent the female form, and when they're put in a chain it's a timeline of things that happened to the woman in her life. The dots are her attempts to get pregnant. Lightning bolts and bars that go down the selvage, those are male symbols which are meant to form a protection for the female symbols,"" he explained. Beni Ouarain carpets were never intended for display, much less export, but came to the notice of designers and decorators in the early 20th century, after Morocco became a French protectorate with new infrastructure, and adventurous travelers ventured into the mountains. The architects Le Corbusier and Alvar Aalto installed the carpets in their much-photographed interiors. They later showed up at the Eames House and Frank Lloyd Wright's Fallingwater, where Mr. Ursch said he first saw them in a modern architectural context. Their popularity has predictably set off a rash of imitations made outside Morocco, often with synthetic fibers and replicated patterns.

Sports,Sports Are Back. Here Are Some Athletes Who Are Not.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/30/sports/players-opt-out.html,"Sports Are Back. Here Are Some Athletes Who Are Not.

Most of the big leagues have at least a handful of players who will not be suiting up for the season, mostly for reasons related to the coronavirus. Here are some of the bigger names who are, or will be, missing the action. Zimmerman has played with Washington every season since the franchise arrived from Montreal in 2005. He is one of about a dozen major leaguers who are opting out of the brief 2020 season. Zimmerman cited his three young children, one a newborn, and his mother, Cheryl, who has multiple sclerosis. A Cy Young winner, the veteran Price was acquired from the Red Sox in the off-season, but won't suit up for the World Series favorite Dodgers in 2020. Price reacted to the news of multiple positive tests on the Marlins this week, saying: ""Part of the reason I'm at home right now is because players' health wasn't being put first. I can see that hasn't changed."" Another Cy Young winner, Hernandez was planning to try to reinvigorate his career with Atlanta. He likewise cited his and his family's health.

Bradley was concerned about the health of his son, who has respiratory problems. Bradley Beal of the Wizards will also miss the season with a shoulder injury. Victor Oladipo was another star who announced he would not play because of concerns over his injured knee. But he changed his mind and had 10 points in 28 minutes in the team's final exhibition game. The league is missing perhaps its biggest star. Because of her struggles with Lyme disease, Delle Donne, the 2019 most valuable player, asked for a medical waiver to skip the season. But a panel of doctors rejected that request, meaning she would not be paid for the season unless she played. Her team wound up saying it would pay her, whatever her decision. It appears unlikely that she will play this season.

Double damage for the Mystics, as Charles, picked up in a trade in the off-season, got a medical exemption because of her extrinsic asthma. The champions are also without Natasha Cloud (focusing on social justice activism) and LaToya Sanders (health concerns). Liz Cambage of the Las Vegas Aces and Chiney Ogwumike of the Los Angeles Sparks also will skip the season.

About a half-dozen N.H.L. players are skipping the playoffs, but the league avoided losing any of its biggest stars. A few of those sitting out are regulars, but the others are primarily minor leaguers who got a few games with the big-league club. The league lost only one big-name player, but he is a very big one. Vela, the reigning most valuable player after a 34-goal season, decided to stay home with his wife, Saioa, who is pregnant, rather than join the league's bubble in Florida. The league also lost two full teams, Nashville and Dallas, from its opening tournament because of a spate of positive tests. The league completed a brief season on Sunday without one of world soccer's biggest stars. Rapinoe opted out of the season in early June, becoming the first marquee athlete in any sport to do so. She did not explicitly state her reasons. Two other players who helped the United States win the World Cup last year, Tobin Heath of the Portland Thorns and Christen Press of the Utah Royals, also chose not to play, both citing concern about the virus. And like M.L.S., the league lost an entire team, the Orlando Pride, after several positive tests. It is still unclear the extent to which the league will be impacted, because players have until early next month to decide on their status. But about 20 have reportedly bowed out. With 32 teams and large rosters, it seems clear more players will sit the season out than in any other league. The Patriots have been hit harder than any other team. Hightower, a linebacker, said, ""This wasn't an easy decision, or one I made lightly, but I do feel that it's the best decision for my family at this time.""","Ryan Zimmerman, David Price, Buster Posey, Carlos Vela and Wilson Chandler are among the players who are opting out of playing this summer because of health concerns.",4f926227-5a0a-583e-96d7-b8884a01060b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/30/sports/30missing-zimmerman/merlin_173950401_83c6e99d-03a4-4021-be1e-a680aebda54e-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0e8ab3813324bb7b10461756797c790114ee065a415a1708315c4da631537478&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ryan Zimmerman, pictured with his daughter Mackenzie, cited his family members when he opted out of the abbreviated baseball season.",4f926227-5a0a-583e-96d7-b8884a01060b,N24News/imgs/4f926227-5a0a-583e-96d7-b8884a01060b.jpg,9

""It's my passion and my dream to become the world's strongest man,"" said Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, the Icelandic giant best known as Gregor Clegane, or the Mountain, on HBO's ""Game of Thrones,"" which returns this month.

But it's not enough to just be strong, he said: ""You have to be quick. You have to have flexibility."" Bara Kristinsdottir for The New York Times

This isn't a figurative statement: The World's Strongest Man is an annual competition -- perhaps you have seen those taking part in the act of pulling airplanes or racing while carrying pairs of refrigerators. On three occasions, Mr. Bjornsson, who stands 6 feet 9 inches and weighs 396 pounds, has made the top three.

Over the last seven years, he has added 166 pounds to his frame by ditching most of his cardio workouts, eating like a horse and lifting weights.

The Man Hafthor Julius Bjornsson, 27, also known as Thor. Actor, strength competitor, father and boyfriend. (""My girlfriend, she's a bit small,"" he said. ""She's around 163 pounds."") The Gear Free weights and barbells, a bench press and simple weight machines. The Uniform He wears spandex shorts, a weight belt and a custom tank top that reads, ""Training to Fight the Mountain."" ""When I post on my Instagram wearing my tank top, people laugh and say, 'Aren't you the Mountain?' I say, 'Yes, I am, but I am fighting myself every day to try and be better.'""

The Regimen A series of basic dead lifts, bench presses and squats in sets of three to five, using extreme amounts of weight, for two to four hours every day. Mr. Bjornsson already dominates the carrying and dragging events in the World's Strongest Man, so his focus is on other things now. ""I train mostly for my static power: dead lifts,"" he said.

The Trainer Mr. Bjornsson works out at a gym run by Magnus Ver Magnusson, a four-time World's Strongest Man winner. ""To become one of the best stone lifters in the world, you have to have a good trainer,"" he said. The Goal ""I would like to win the World's Strongest Man competition, as you would win best writer in the world,"" he said. ""Is that a title that exists?"" The Diet Mr. Bjornsson packs away eight meals a day. Breakfast consists of eight eggs, with oatmeal and fruit. The other meals comprise meats, grains and vegetables as well as fatty foods like avocado and organic peanut butter. ""I eat quite healthy for a big guy like me, but you get sick of eating all the time,"" he said. ""Today, I was supposed to have chicken with sweet potatoes and greens. Because I didn't want that, I had salmon. We have very good fish in Iceland. Everything is expensive in Iceland, especially food, and especially healthy food.""

Fashion & Style,How to Speak Fashion Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/18/fashion/mens-style/how-to-speak-fashion-week.html,"The columnist Russell Baker complained about the overuse of the word ""icon"" in this newspaper back in 1997. Since then, its adjectival form has spread like an invasive species. It holds a special place among the fashion set as a descriptor for an outfit that puts one in mind of a look from myth, legend or classic movie. A poncho can be ""iconic"" if it looks like the one worn by Clint Eastwood in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" for instance.

But like fashion, language is always evolving, and in recent months, the word has sometimes been used as a pejorative. Upon seeing a get-up that mimicked the look of Marlon Brando in ""The Wild Ones,"" an underwhelmed critic may say, ""Points for trying, but isn't it a bit ... iconic?""

Why say ""shirts"" when you can say ""shirting""? In defense of this term, it may be said that it serves as a catchall for the full array of shirt styles offered by a particular label. Its real purpose, though, is to signify that the speaker is part of the fashion crowd.

When most people use the word ""story,"" they mean a narrative with a beginning, a middle and an end. Fashion people have long used it as a stand-in for ""theme"": A stylist or editor may refer to a four-page magazine fashion shoot with a rugged setting as ""an outdoor story,"" for instance.

Lately, the meaning of ""story"" has expanded greatly. I have heard it used to describe a runway show with some momentum (""That was a good story"") as well as a fashion reporter's smartphone case decorated with pink unicorn stickers (""Such a fun story. I love it"").","A ""directional"" guide to the latest buzzwords.",b1e95bf1-a2bf-530d-9b1d-4ff58e07350d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/18/fashion/18FASHIONSPEAKweb/18FASHIONSPEAKweb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d24c135ad113b09d74ee62bb3fc3c8fd017b2fd7d93624c15282804f1abe8999&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Guests watching the finale of the Marni spring 2018 men's wear show in Milan.

Automobiles,A Singular Mercedes Aims for Another Record,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/automobiles/a-singular-mercedes-aims-for-another-record.html,"A 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 grand prix car raced by the five-time world champion Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina will go on the block Friday at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in Britain. The rarity and historical significance of the car make it a contender to set a record for an automobile sold at auction. Driven by Fangio to wins at the grands prix of Germany and Switzerland in its debut year, it is the only one of the 14 built for the Mercedes racing team in 1954 and 1955 that found its way to a private owner. The current high-water mark for a car sold at public auction is $16.4 million, brought by a 1957 Ferrari Testa Rossa racing sports car of unimpressive provenance at a sale in Pebble Beach, Calif., in August 2011. The Mercedes auction, to be conducted by Bonhams, has attracted considerable attention because of the car's breakthrough engineering and its dominance in both seasons of its competitive career, taking Fangio to consecutive world drivers championships.

The W196 -- the factory's internal designation for the cars -- was built in two versions, open-wheel and with a streamlined body, and with three different wheelbases. The car was powered by an in-line 8-cylinder engine that had its power takeoff in the middle, making it the equivalent of two 4-cylinder engines, a measure intended to minimize crankshaft whip. The engine's valvetrain used a desmodromic system for positive mechanical opening and closing, and it was equipped with fuel injection, an innovation at the time.

Ten of the original 14 cars still exist: six remain with Mercedes and three are in museums, in Indianapolis, Vienna and Turin, Italy. The continuing surge in the prices paid for classic cars has given rise to speculation of a sale price of around $20 million. Other factors -- the car can't be driven without a support staff of mechanics, it can't be licensed for the road -- may keep it out of record territory, though. A veteran collector and car dealer, Don Williams, head of the Blackhawk Collection, has maintained for years that the ""heavy hitters"" with millions to spend don't go to auctions. But, he said in a telephone interview, ""If you don't buy this one, you won't be able to find another.""

The top prices in recent private sales -- generally accepted as correct by experts close to the transactions but not confirmed by the parties involved -- are on another scale: $40 million in 2010 for a 1936 Bugatti Atlantic by Peter Mullin, who specializes in French cars, and $35 million for a 1964 Ferrari 250 GTO coupe by the collector Craig McCaw last year. The W196 for sale at Goodwood was presented by Daimler-Benz to the Beaulieu National Motor Museum in Britain in 1973 with the understanding that it would be kept in the museum. But there was no binding agreement. The museum eventually sold it to the British heavy equipment manufacturer Sir Anthony Bamford. It later went to a French collector, then to a German, and about 10 years ago was bought by a member of the ruling family of Qatar. Whatever the sale price, the value escalation in the vintage and classic car market has been little short of staggering. When Henry Manney, a Road & Track editor, brought his Ferrari GTO to California from Europe in the 1960s, he had no takers at $8,000 and had to lower the price to $6,000. By these standards, the Bugatti collector Dr. Peter Williamson paid what must have been considered an exorbitant price when, in 1971, he gave $59,000 for the car now owned by Mr. Mullin.",A 1954 Mercedes-Benz W196 grand prix car raced by the world champion Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina will be auctioned on Friday in Britain and could set a record for an automobile sold at auction.,4c7a6b84-3802-5579-be6a-020a87eb84ce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/07/automobiles/Fangio1/Fangio1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=208&w=600&s=4f5cc14a53f6dbe47d21c39f0204c646684c2d4213b68eb273f56fc126523220&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,DOMINATOR The Mercedes W196 at the 1954 German Grand Prix; a streamlined W196 can be seen farther back.,4c7a6b84-3802-5579-be6a-020a87eb84ce,N24News/imgs/4c7a6b84-3802-5579-be6a-020a87eb84ce.jpg,23
Well,The Girl Who Hunts With Hawks,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/well/move/the-girl-who-hunts-with-hawks.html,"Anna Kendrick isn't just beautiful; if you could spend time with her in the woods, you'd realize she's also lethal, a born hunter with a killer's reflexes who thrives on things you'd never put in your mouth. Jenna Woginrich is one of the few who have seen Anna in action, and it didn't come easily. At first, Jenna and Anna just hung out together, watching movies at night in front of a crackling wood stove. It took weeks before they trusted each other enough for Anna to cut loose and show her wild side. Jenna was thrilled -- but it didn't last long. ""By that summer, she was gone,"" Jenna says, with surprisingly little regret in her voice. ""I haven't seen her since."" It's a miserable day as we walk the woods near her upstate New York farm, freezing rain and icy winds lashing us from all sides, but Jenna has reason to be upbeat: on her arm is the new love in her life, a gorgeous red-tailed hawk she calls Aya Cash after the actress who starred in ""You're the Worst.""

""I have got to stop naming hawks after people,"" Jenna says. ""It's really going to mess up their Google results. Someone out there is going to find my stuff online and think the star of 'Pitch Perfect' killed a mouse in my living room."" Jenna was 29 when she began hunting with hawks. It's been five years since then, and by the strict code of falconry, she remains an apprentice. Still, she's expert enough to have trapped three wild hawks and trained each to ignore its own instincts and share with Jenna the rabbit or squirrel it just killed (surprisingly tasty, by the way, as nachos or mole).

""Why don't they just fly away?"" I ask. ""Sometimes they do,"" Jenna says. ""We're about to find out."" Today is Aya's big test. Jenna is about to set her free on her first solo flight, giving Aya a choice between staying with Jenna or rocketing back into the forest. That's the magic I'm hoping to understand: what makes a bird of prey choose human friendship over freedom? Back home, I was facing a similar challenge with Sherman, the badly neglected donkey we'd adopted. Like all of us, Sherman needed more than a home; he needed a purpose, a daily mission that would put his mind and muscles to use. I'd decided to make him my running partner for a long-distance burro race in Colorado, but one thing kept nagging at me: Was he signing on for this adventure or just submitting to it? Was there a way to make us a true team?

If anyone knows, it's the woman who watches ""Firefly"" with a live raptor on her shoulder. Not that she was born to this; Jenna is a graphic designer by training who grew up in the suburbs. ""I didn't know chickens came in different colors until after I graduated college,"" she says. ""I worked with a woman who sold eggs from her cubicle and I thought You can do that? I got my first laying hens from her and that was my gateway drug."" She saved enough money to buy her own six-acre homestead and decided to quit her lucrative job at the outdoor equipment company Orvis to scratch out a living from the land. Now she raises pigs and sheep, teaches archery, gives fiddle classes and writes books about her life as a solo farmer. Jenna got her first taste of falconry at a nearby resort where she worked as an archery instructor. She loved everything about it: the ancient lore, the long hikes in the woods, but especially, the intense focus and kinship necessary to bond with a creature whose every native instinct is to get as far from you as possible. To get started, you have to find two things: 1) a seasoned falconer who agrees to monitor your hawk's health, and 2) a hawk. Jenna caught Aya by slowly driving the roads around her farm for three weeks until she spotted that proud, unmistakable silhouette perched on a telephone wire. She tossed out a trap -- basically, a ball of chicken wire with bait inside -- and when Aya pounced, so did Jenna. Hawks are submissive when cornered, so Jenna was able to gather Aya up in a T-shirt, free her talons from the wire mesh, and take her home. ""I'm not teaching her to be my pet,"" Jenna explains. ""I'm giving her a chance to stay alive and become a strong hunter."" Only one in every 10 hawks survives until breeding age in the wild, so oddly, the luckiest moment of Aya's life might have been the day she was scooped into Jenna's hands. Jenna spends hours with Aya every day, feeding her morsels of rabbit and mouse -- the same food she'd eat on her own -- and testing her with short, tethered flights to sharpen her hunting eye. ""Aya and I are all about work,"" Jenna says. They're picking up a partnership that's been around since before the Pharaohs. Ancient Egyptians were often buried with their favorite kestrel, and even cave art depicts early hunters with hawks and dogs. Very early in our in history, humans and raptors must have worked out a deal that satisfied both.

Jenna spotted what she was looking for: a branch about head-high in a tree with good flight clearance. It's a risky day for flying. Aya may not spot Jenna in the gray rain or hear her voice over the wind. Still, Jenna slips off Aya's hood and eases her onto the branch. Jenna turns her back on Aya. As we walk away, wondering what Aya will do, Jenna lets me in on her best advice. Every fall, she says, she catches a new hawk. They hunt together all winter and come spring, when the bird is ready to mate, Jenna leaves it in a field with a fresh-killed rabbit to start its own life. ""You spend time crafting something beautiful, and then you let it go,"" is how Jenna puts it. ""The wild can be human work,"" notes Helen Macdonald in her 2014 memoir ""H Is for Hawk,"" pointing out that without the gentle intervention of falconers who protect their birds until maturity, entire species would now be extinct. Sherman comes from a long line of desert foragers who evolved to trot marathon distances. Aya is a fledgling whose survival is threatened by power lines, farmers and bulldozed woodlands. If we can help them develop their native talents, we'll have something better than a pet: a partner.",The bond a falconer makes with a hawk is more than that of owner and pet.,c4fd0eac-533b-5867-8dd1-4762ec7c1dbc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/23/well/23sherman1/23sherman1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=427&w=816&s=a7689cfa64a3a898dc05576cd576d7bd5e0dbae43b5326d92800c64e55c6c5af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jenna Woginrich lets her falcon, Aya, fly.",c4fd0eac-533b-5867-8dd1-4762ec7c1dbc,N24News/imgs/c4fd0eac-533b-5867-8dd1-4762ec7c1dbc.jpg,18
Art & Design,"Up for Bid, AI Art Signed 'Algorithm'",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/arts/design/christies-art-artificial-intelligence-obvious.html,"With their eyes trained on a gilded frame containing a smeared, half-formed image of a distinguished gentleman, a small group of potential bidders gathered Friday night over cocktails at Christie's New York and heard the pitch: here was the first portrait generated by an algorithm to come up for auction. The portrait, produced by artificial intelligence, hung on the wall opposite an Andy Warhol print and just to the right of a bronze work by Roy Lichtenstein. There were some smiles and at least one frown. Two people snapped cellphone pictures of the work, which looked as though someone had taken a sponge to a 17th-century oil portrait. The arrival of what some call the infant stages of the next great art movement at one of the world's leading auction houses was greeted nonchalantly, with a nod of understanding and a sip of mezcal margarita. Christie's is hoping for a more explosive reaction on Thursday, when the gavel comes down on ""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,"" formally testing the art market's interest in AI art. The work -- estimated at $7,000-$10,000 -- was a collaboration by the members of Obvious, a French trio composed of a student of machine learning and two business school graduates, none of whom have a background in art. There was no paint or brushes involved, just an algorithm that learns to imitate sets of images fed by humans -- in this case, thousands of portraits spanning the 14th century to the 20th.

But is it art? Frederique Baumgartner, an art historian at Columbia University, said the AI work raised questions about ""intention and authorship,"" but so, too, did artists from the past, including Marcel Duchamp (who famously made art out of a urinal). She went on to compare the portrait's contrasting tones, coupled with the subject's sober dress, with the old master of the Dutch Golden Age, Rembrandt van Rijn -- though she quickly added, ""That's if I look half-closing my eyes.""

The unusual sale shows the challenge traditional auction houses face staying relevant in a culture that moves at WiFi-enabled speeds. Christie's -- which shattered auction-house records in 2017 when it sold a $450 million Leonardo da Vinci painting -- reached out directly to Obvious this year, rather than working through a seller. (It is the only AI work in Thursday's sale of 363 lots.) Surprisingly, the loudest criticism has come not from the art establishment but from the small but passionate community of artists who work with AI, many of whom say that what Christie's and Obvious suggested was groundbreaking was in fact effectively AI Art 101. Ahmed Elgammal, the director of the Art and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory at Rutgers University, said that the technology used to create the work, Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs, had been used by artists since around 2015. ""This group was totally irrelevant,"" he scoffed. Mario Klingemann, a German artist known for his work with GANs, put it bluntly. ""When I saw that announcement"" of the auction, he said, ""my reaction was 'you can't be serious.'"" He compared the portrait by Obvious ""to a connect-the-dots children's painting."" Richard Lloyd, the International Head of the Prints & Multiples department at Christie's, who brought the work in, acknowledged that he hadn't made an exhaustive search of the small but very active field of AI art. ""I just responded to it and thought it'd be cool,"" he said.

What struck Mr. Lloyd most, he said, was the work's resemblance to European portraiture. ""It looks like something you'd expect Christie's to sell,"" he explained. ""We're the people who sold the Leonardo for $450 million."" He thought that the work Obvious was doing would be a good way to ease potential buyers at Christie's into work made with AI. ""I like the fact that it didn't at first blush look different,"" he said. Many artists and researchers who specialize in artistic applications of AI technology, while generally glad of the potential exposure the sale could bring, say that the portrait chosen by Christie's is derivative. Codes written to produce the kind of images Obvious has made are also shared freely online among enthusiasts, raising questions of originality. For its part, Obvious acknowledges that the technology it used was gleaned from others. ""It's open source,"" explained Pierre Fautrel, one of the group's members, in an interview in New York last week. ""We took a lot of different parts from different people.""

The biggest difference between the Obvious portrait and their predecessors' is the fact that Obvious had theirs printed on canvas and ""signed"" in the bottom right corner with a mathematical function used to produce it. They also had it extravagantly framed. ""We're introducing it to people who do not necessarily know what a GAN algorithm is,"" Mr. Lloyd explained, speaking to the presentation. ""It has to be, all things being equal, comparatively simple.""

The opportunity to capitalize on the buzz surrounding artificial intelligence fits in with Christie's efforts to market itself in new ways. In July it held its first Art & Tech summit, focused on the theme of blockchain, the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. (Obvious themselves have sold art on SuperRare, an online marketplace that allows users to buy and sell digital artwork using cryptocurrency.) Brick-and-mortar auction houses have been slow to accept art that explores new technologies. To be sure, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips offer plenty of digitally generated works by blue-chip artists like Andreas Gursky and Christopher Wool. But the sort of digital video and virtual reality pieces that are featured routinely at contemporary art biennials rarely, if ever, appear at auction houses. Artists in the field are hoping that works sold at auctions like Christie's will increasingly enter private collections. That appears to be happening more often. Earlier this year the New Delhi art gallery Nature Morte hosted what was billed as India's first exhibition of work made entirely by AI, including works by Mr. Klingemann, Tom White, Memo Akten, Jake Elwes and Anna Ridler. In December, Dr. Elgammal of Rutgers will exhibit AI art for sale at SCOPE Miami Beach, a satellite fair during the time of Art Basel Miami Beach.","Preparing to test the art market — and young buyers — with ""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy.""",ea01a415-049f-5dc1-ab73-589140835ed9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/arts/23aiportrait5/23aiportrait5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fd4a8a9acdff47678646e754b91b80d0725551170e3072557798842547c24a0d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Edmond de Belamy, from La Famille de Belamy,"" a print on canvas produced by the French collective Obvious, working with artificial intelligence, will be auctioned Thursday at Christie's.",ea01a415-049f-5dc1-ab73-589140835ed9,N24News/imgs/ea01a415-049f-5dc1-ab73-589140835ed9.jpg,14
Style,The Art of the Pitch in the Midst of a Pandemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/style/publicists-marketing-coronavirus.html,"The Art of the Pitch in the Midst of a Pandemic

LOS ANGELES -- Millions of people had started to shelter in place. The global economy was cratering. Coronavirus-panicked shoppers were clawing at each other over toilet paper. But apocalypse be darned. Ashley McCormick, a fashion publicist at Ragdoll PR in Los Angeles, had a product to promote. ""Forget everything you've ever heard about latex,"" her March 19 email to lifestyle journalists began. She was not referring to gloves. ""Latex has become an inescapable fashion sensation, with designers creating unique and innovative looks for both on and off the runway,"" Ms. McCormick wrote, citing Bella Hadid and Kim Kardashian West as celebrity devotees. ""But jumping straight into a full latex look may seem intimidating. So why not test the waters first with sexy & seductive latex lingerie? Our luxury lingerie line, Anya Lust, is the perfect place to find all your latex lingerie needs."" At first glance, Ms. McCormick's note, forwarded to me by a nonplused recipient, came across as offensively extraterrestrial. What planet was this person living on? Then I felt an emotion approaching compassion: She was just doing her job.

The undergarment makers of the world have payroll to make too. So do boutique public relations agencies. Fashion magazines have pages to fill; online influencers have beauty trends to discover. Just how do you go about promoting nonessential products (celebrities, linoleum, jewelry, $230 latex thongs) at a time of death counts and soaring unemployment and improvised hospitals? A single ill-considered post on social media could result in tar and feathers -- both for companies and for brand-name people, as David Geffen discovered with his Instagram salutation from self-isolation in the fancy-pants Grenadines. Even Wonder Woman got it wrong: Gal Gadot's now-infamous coronavirus video, which found her and a flock of celebrity chums warbling ""Imagine,"" will likely haunt her (and us) forever. There wasn't a single publicist around to body-block that thing? ""How brands appear to the world during this pandemic could impact how people see them for years to come, good and bad,"" said Lauren Reed, the founder of Reed Public Relations, a firm in Nashville with dining, tourism and fitness clients, among others. As the pandemic began to escalate in mid-March, Ms. Reed started a free hotline for small businesses looking for communications advice. Callers have included a cosmetic surgery center and a furniture maker.

""We're finding that a lot of people are totally lost,"" she said. Howard Bragman, the Hollywood publicist and crisis communications expert, warned that ham-handed efforts to tie products to the pandemic could do as much brand damage as charging forward as if the world had not changed at all. ""We're all getting these marketing messages in our feeds that feel really gross -- trying to sell us things we don't need by slapping on an 'in these difficult times' at the start of the pitch,"" Mr. Bragman said by phone. ""I understand that people are worried about their businesses, and rightly so. It's awful. But my personal belief is this: It's OK to say nothing for a while.""

Ms. McCormick was far from alone in pushing ahead with her promotional duties. A few hours after her pitch went out into the world, American-Brazilian Body Waxing, a Miami salon, sent a jolly email to clients to unveil a new social media account. (""Follow us on Instagram!"") A socially conscious fashion company, Able, publicized a sale on earrings and apparel -- a way to ""keep things classy"" while social distancing. (Worried about looking good on Zoom work meetings? Just remember: ""Business on top, comfort on the bottom."") Krista Ritterhoff, a publicist at Bullfrog + Baum, a New York agency, emailed a reporter she did not know -- twice -- in hopes of generating attention for Singapore as a ""Westworld"" shooting location. ""Hope all is well!"" her March 20 note started.

Clint Morris, who runs October Coast Publicity in Burbank, Calif., got in touch with me to offer an interview with an actress. ""Please let me know if you'd like to talk to Jamie Bernadette ('I Spit on Your Grave: Deja Vu') for her new film 'Dead by Dawn,' releasing in April,"" he wrote in an email. ""Happy to coordinate!"" A little too on the nose, perhaps. Ms. Ritterhoff, the high-spirited Singapore slinger, declined to comment. Mr. Morris said: ""Like everyone else, we're a little frightened -- the pandemic, the uncertainty of the entertainment business -- but the show has to go on. People need entertainment and distraction right now, so we can help with that."" Greta Kovacs Schmid, the owner and chief executive of Ragdoll PR, responded on Ms. McCormick's behalf. ""We are doing the best we can to remain sensitive in content and approach,"" Ms. Kovacs Schmid said. ""Most of our clients are small businesses and are really struggling from the pandemic, as most companies currently are, so now more than ever is it important for us to pitch."" And the response from editors and influencers? ""We've actually seen a dramatic increase in responses to our pitching efforts,"" she said. ""We've chatted with many close editor contacts who let us know they still want us to keep pitching. They understand this is our job, and we're just trying to keep our company and our clients' companies afloat."" Some agencies, however, have taken a more cautious approach. Fitz & Co., with a client list that includes Art Basel and Gagosian, stopped pitching media outlets as soon as the coronavirus started to spread in the United States, according to its founder and chief executive, Sara Fitzmaurice.",Publicists for products in the pipeline long before the outbreak struggle to find the right tone.,993f76e0-5bf0-5a81-b236-d0cd962bc1cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/fashion/07VIRUS-PUBLICISTSart/07VIRUS-PUBLICISTSart-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3548ccdc89ca1132e8e8a948709f4d49703bbfc594f82d46141c72d9c439d4b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"How do you sell shoes, earrings, a bikini or a movie in the midst of all this?",993f76e0-5bf0-5a81-b236-d0cd962bc1cc,N24News/imgs/993f76e0-5bf0-5a81-b236-d0cd962bc1cc.jpg,15
Music,"Operagoers So Young, the Met Adds Changing Tables and Stroller Parking",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/29/arts/music/met-opera-bambino-babies.html,"The average age at the Metropolitan Opera is about to get lower -- much lower. Sitting still will not be required: Audience members will be encouraged to crawl around and interact with the singers if they like. The dress code will be so relaxed that many operagoers may opt for onesies.

No, the barbarians are not at the gate. The Met is presenting a new opera for babies.

The company will present 10 free performances of ""BambinO,"" an opera for babies between 6 months old and 18 months old, from April 30 to May 5 in the opera house's smaller auditorium, List Hall, the Met announced on Thursday. The 40-minute opera -- scored for two singers and two musicians -- will be performed for a small audience of babies and caregivers.

Discerning preverbal operagoers need not fear: ""BambinO"" earned good reviews when it had its premiere last summer in Britain. ""It worked, contrary to expectation (mine), on so many levels it's hard to tease them apart,"" Fiona Maddocks wrote in The Observer.","Who says the opera audience is graying?

Opinion,I'm a Doctor in Italy. We Have Never Seen Anything Like This.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-italy.html,"I'm a Doctor in Italy. We Have Never Seen Anything Like This.

MILAN -- None of us have ever experienced a tragedy like it. We know how to respond to road accidents, train derailments, even earthquakes. But a virus that has killed so many, which gets worse with each passing day and for which a cure -- or even containment -- seems distant? No. We always think of calamity as something that will happen far from us, to others far away, in another part of the world. It's a kind of superstition. But not this time. This time it happened here, to us -- to our loved ones, our neighbors, our colleagues. I'm an anesthesiologist at the Policlinico San Donato here in Milan, which is part of the Lombardy region, the heart of the Italian coronavirus outbreak. On Feb. 21, the day on which the first case was recorded, our hospital, which specializes in cardiac surgery, offered to help with the care of patients with Covid-19. Along with other hospitals, we created a task force of intensive care doctors to be sent to hospitals in the ""red zone."" All planned surgeries were postponed. Intensive care beds were given over to the treatment of coronavirus patients. Within 24 hours, the hospital created new intensive care places by converting operating theaters and anesthetic rooms. And 40 more beds were dedicated to patients suspected or proven to have the virus, though not in a serious condition.

The patients who arrive remain for many days, straining medical resources. Already across northern Italy -- in Lombardy, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna and Marche -- health care systems are under enormous stress. Medical workers are exhausted. As the virus spreads, other regions will soon find themselves in the same situation. Fortunately, Lombardy and the national government adopted aggressive containment measures 10 days ago. By the end of this week -- after 15 days, the incubation period of the infection -- we will see whether such measures have been effective. Only then might we see a slowing down in the spread of the virus. It cannot come too soon. There has been speculation that doctors may be forced to decide whom to treat, leaving some without immediate care. That's not my experience: All patients at my hospital have received the treatment they require. But that may not last. If the number of patients infected does not start to drop, our resources won't stretch to cover them. At that point, triaging patients -- to give priority to those with more chances of survival -- may become standard practice.

My colleagues, at the Policlinico and throughout the country, are showing a great spirit of sacrifice. We know how much we are needed right now; that gives us strength to withstand fatigue and stress. How long such resistance will last, I cannot say. Some colleagues have tested positive for the coronavirus, and a few have needed intensive care. For us all, the dangers are great. As an anesthesiologist devoted to surgical emergencies, I haven't had many direct dealings with coronavirus patients. But there was one. An elderly man in a fragile condition, he was set to have tumor removed. The surgery proceeded as normal: I put him to sleep, and he awoke four hours later, without pain. That was in mid-February. A week later, the telltale symptoms began to show: a high fever, a cough. Before long, pneumonia. Now he's in intensive care, intubated and in a critical condition. He is one of many who have become a number without a name, one of those that represent the worsening of the situation. I hope the beginning of the end of this outbreak will be soon. But we will know that it's coming only if and when the infections begin to decline. The population's calm response to the restrictive rules imposed by the government, the experience gained in the management of critically ill patients and the rumors of new treatments for the infection are grounds for hope. Perhaps the containment measures will work, and the news at the end of the week will be good. But for now, we are in the thick of tragedy.

Theater,Amy Schumer to Make Broadway Debut in New Steve Martin Play,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/theater/amy-schumer-steve-martin-broadway-meteor-shower.html,"Mr. Martin said he recruited Ms. Schumer for the play, approaching her at a party at her house and asking her to read the script. Ms. Schumer, who once performed in a production of Mr. Martin's earlier play, ""Picasso at the Lapin Agile,"" agreed, and her willingness to do the play gave it the oomph to get it to Broadway.

Reviews of the earlier productions were mixed. In The San Diego Union-Tribune, Pam Kragen called the play ""a wacky exploration of love, life, death, inner selves, order, chaos and astronomical wonders"" and said it was ""frequently hilarious"" but that it ""loses its ways a bit in the second act."" But in The Los Angeles Times, Charles McNulty was more critical, saying the play ""has an air of juvenilia"" and comparing it to ""sitcom Ionesco crossed with a 'Saturday Night Live' parody of Edward Albee's 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' ""

In Connecticut, the Hartford Courant's Christopher Arnott also praised the jokes but questioned the substance, writing, ""You can't help wishing that 'Meteor Shower' was a meatier show."" But in Variety, Frank Rizzo was more enthusiastic, writing that ""even amid the head-scratching, it's a pleasure watching how Martin probes the fault line of marriage, social dynamics and cultural swings.""

The director of the Broadway production, Jerry Zaks (""Hello, Dolly!""), said the script is being revised. ""We've made adjustments, we've made cuts, he's rewritten -- we've just begun the process of trying to get the script to be everything it can be,"" he said.","Ms. Schumer will star in ""Meteor Shower"" this fall along with Laura Benanti, Keegan-Michael Key and Alan Tudyk.",9711a927-0f3c-5e22-9d61-4cd207abc842,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/08/arts/08meteor2/08meteor2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=11eb457a937f5d04c984e02f80414835a98a58d2c4ae9292680572592da5df4f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Amy Schumer will star in ""Meteor Shower,"" about an encounter between two couples in California.",9711a927-0f3c-5e22-9d61-4cd207abc842,N24News/imgs/9711a927-0f3c-5e22-9d61-4cd207abc842.jpg,10
Travel,Coronavirus Disrupts Travel Plans Across Asia,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/travel/traveling-coronavirus.html,"In the midst of spreading fear over the coronavirus outbreak, travelers to Asia, even to countries far from the epicenter of the virus in China, are beginning to reconsider their plans. While hard data on cancellations is scarce, as airlines, hotels and travel boards say they do not yet have numbers or will not share them, some tour operators, travel insurance brokers and even airline employees say they are facing growing numbers of customers changing their plans. Brian Fitzgerald, president of Overseas Adventure Travel, a company providing group tours to travelers mostly over 50, said that after its initial cancellations for trips to China through April in the wake of the outbreak's announcement, this week tourists slated to go to Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam were starting to reconsider as well. ""People are worried about traveling to Asia when they should be cognizant of traveling to China,"" Mr. Fitzgerald said.

He said the company had received ""almost no new bookings"" to China for the first half of the year and canceled trips. It offered about 400 travelers a full refund, the option to go elsewhere or to take the trip at a later date. The January data for APRIL Travel Protection, an insurance provider, which tracks residents in the United States traveling to every country in the world, shows that claims with an Asian country in the itinerary more than doubled compared to January of 2019. Additionally this January, 3 percent of all the company's received claims were for cancellations related to the coronavirus. Hopper, a booking site that specializes in using data to suggest the best time to purchase travel, estimated that demand for international travel had declined by 3 percent since the first week in January, said Brianna Schneider, the company's director of communications in an email. She said 80 percent of the decline was directly driven by demand from the United States to China; the other 20 percent was ""a peripheral impact on other international destinations.""

""They don't want to go to Asia,"" she said. ""Even though we cannot waive the fee for the Philippines or the other Southeast Asian countries, they still want to cancel."" Similarly, Jordan, a Philippines-based customer service agent for Singapore Airlines who did not provide his last name because of company policy, confirmed an uptick in cancellations, despite the fact that the airline has offered to reroute passengers to bypass mainland China and Hong Kong without charge. The continent of Asia has become an increasingly popular tourist destination in recent years. In 2018, more than 343 million international tourists traveled to Asia and the Pacific, according to the World Tourism Organization, an increase of 6 percent from the prior year. The coronavirus, with its initial cases reported in Wuhan, China, has sickened more than 31,000 people with more than 600 deaths reported as of Friday -- all but two deaths in mainland China. More than 20 international carriers have suspended or restricted routes that ended in Wuhan and other major Chinese cities, including Beijing, Hong Kong and Shanghai. A number of airlines including China Eastern Airlines, Cathay Pacific and Air China route passengers through those cities on their way to other destinations. For some travelers, even a brief layover in China is not worth the risk. The newlyweds Jessica Salina and her husband, Anthony, planned to honeymoon in Japan in March -- their first time traveling to Asia. But their Air China flight between Los Angeles and Tokyo included a layover in Beijing, and they decided to cancel on Jan. 30.

""My biggest fear was not Japan, but that layover in Beijing,"" Ms. Salina said in an email. ""Between the large airport and additional screenings, I was starting to full-blown panic."" Luckily for her, the tour operator she booked through, Affordable World, provided penalty-free refunds for cancellation of flights passing through China. But other travelers whose itineraries never touched China are choosing to cancel as well, concerned about assuming unnecessary risk for a trip that can be taken another time. Japan, now in the heat of preparations for the summer Olympics and trying to avoid an outbreak there, has focused attention on the Diamond Princess, a cruise ship that has been docked in its port city of Yokohama since last week. More than 2,000 passengers are under a two-week quarantine, as cases onboard have escalated rapidly. Up to 61 people had tested positive for coronavirus by Friday, from the 20 cases confirmed Thursday. Thursday morning the Holland America Line updated its website, saying that it had been notified that the Japanese government would not allow the estimated 2,000 passengers aboard its MS Westerdam to dock in Japanese ports. The company issued a statement: ""We are quickly working to develop alternate plans for guests currently on board and will keep them updated as information becomes available."" The cruise line has canceled a sailing on the Westerdam, scheduled to embark in Yokohama Feb. 15, but has announced no changes to the ship's itinerary after that time.

Other cruise companies that operate in Asia declined to specify changes to their planned sailings or how many people had canceled. ""All itineraries that call in mainland China for the next six months are currently under review and we will communicate any itinerary revisions as soon as possible,"" Norwegian Cruise Line said in a statement. ""As always, we will closely monitor the situation and take appropriate action as necessary."" Kay Cuellar, deputy manager of the Los Angeles office of the Japan National Tourism Organization, noted earlier in the week that in Japan, ""all the necessary precautions are being taken"" and cautioned visitors not to overreact. ""I don't think it necessarily warrants the great concern that it's getting in the media,"" Ms. Cuellar said. ""There's no cause for that level of alarm."" In addition to the infected passengers aboard the Diamond Princess, Japan has another at least 25 cases. Stephen England-Hall, the chief executive of Tourism New Zealand, said in an email that his country had not seen a significant impact on arrivals yet, but that even though New Zealand is more than 6,000 miles away from Wuhan: ""We expect that there will be a general softening in consumers preference to travel globally as a result."" Jason Schreier, the chief executive of APRIL Travel Protection, said the company's call center had been lit up with travelers calling to purchase policies and to better understand their current coverage. Mr. Schreier said the company had received a plethora of calls from travel agents and tourists trying to determine if they would be reimbursed for canceling based on growing concern about coronavirus. The answer in most cases was no: ""Fear of going to someplace is not unfortunately something that people can cancel for unless they have 'cancel for any reason' coverage,"" he said. That coverage is far more expensive than the standard policy.","Some tour operators, travel insurance brokers and even airline employees say they are facing growing numbers of customers who want to avoid the region.",0149b314-4aee-5b41-9db5-d69c40a0beb9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/07/travel/07corona-travelplans-sub/merlin_168414918_174718a9-3b83-4481-afb4-5284685c6955-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ad95713d42be5bac495b1644afd848f126c8895f2878a4fa24aa0be1f89616d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The almost empty halls of Shanghai Pudong Airport in Shanghai, China on Tuesday.",0149b314-4aee-5b41-9db5-d69c40a0beb9,N24News/imgs/0149b314-4aee-5b41-9db5-d69c40a0beb9.jpg,4
Books,Women Dominate Shortlist for Booker International Prize,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/09/books/man-booker-international-prize-shortlist.html,"LONDON -- The Polish author Olga Tokarczuk could win a second consecutive Man Booker International Prize, arguably the world's most significant award for literature translated into English, after she was shortlisted for the honor on Tuesday. Five of this year's six nominated authors are women.

If Ms. Tokarczuk wins for ""Drive Your Plow Over the Bones of the Dead,"" an unconventional detective novel that also discusses topics like animal rights and the influence of the Roman Catholic Church in Poland, it would be an unusual back-to-back victory for a major literary award. She won last year's prize for ""Flights,"" a series of literary vignettes about modern-day travel.

""Flights"" was translated by Jennifer Croft, but her new novel was translated from the Polish by Antonia Lloyd-Jones.

The Man Booker International Prize is awarded each year to the best book translated into English and published in Britain or Ireland. It is distinct from the more well-known Booker Prize, for fiction originally published in English, but both carry the same prize money of 50,000 pounds, or about $65,000.","The Polish writer Olga Tokarczuk, last year's winner, was among five women on the shortlist of six authors for the translated literature prize.

Technology,New PlayStation and Xbox Arrive During a Pandemic Gold Rush,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/technology/ps5-xbox-pandemic.html,"EMERYVILLE, Calif. -- Huddled under blankets to brace against the cold, J.B. August and his buddies couldn't help grinning as the doors of the boarded-up GameStop store finally opened. The six men, strangers turned friends after camping outside on the sidewalk all night, let out whoops of excitement on Tuesday morning as they finally got inside to buy the boxy yet sleek new Xboxes. ""I'm just treating myself -- it's therapy,"" said Mr. August, 35, before triumphantly carrying the device out of the store after 18 hours of waiting. ""I never really have time to do anything for myself, so let me just go ahead and make an investment for myself and my peace of mind."" The gaming craze on display in the Bay Area was echoed around the country this week as video gamers flocked to stores and crashed preorder websites in their rush to buy new video game consoles: Microsoft's Xbox Series X and Sony's PlayStation 5.

The release of the devices heralded the beginning of a new generation for video gamers, but in many ways was just an exclamation point on what has already been a huge year in the gaming industry. With much of the world confined to homes throughout the coronavirus pandemic, many have sought out entertainment for the first time through games on various devices. Hard-core fans are logging more hours on their screens, too. Gamers worldwide are expected to spend a record $175 billion on software alone in 2020, according to Newzoo, a gaming analytics firm, up from $146 billion a year ago. In the United States, gamers spent $33.7 billion across hardware, accessories and content through September, according to the NPD Group. And Piers Harding-Rolls, a research director at Ampere Analysis, an analytics firm in London, projected that Sony would sell 8.5 million PS5s and Microsoft would sell 6.5 million of the Xbox Series X and the smaller, cheaper Series S through March. But some Wall Street investors wonder: Are the pandemic-fueled growth and soaring profits of the video game industry -- which was already bigger, by sales, than the film and music industries -- sustainable after the virus subsides and doors to the outside are flung open again? When news broke Monday that a Pfizer vaccine candidate had been found to be encouragingly effective in fighting the coronavirus, video game stocks like Activision Blizzard, Electronic Arts and Take-Two Interactive fell along with quarantine mainstays like Zoom and Peloton.

""It's a concern on the part of a lot of investors that once stay-at-home rules are eased, that these publishers will see less engagement with their games,"" said Yung Kim, an entertainment technology analyst for Piper Sandler & Company. ""It's a matter of how people decide to spend their time."" Interviews with two dozen gamers, livestreamers turned influencers, analysts and company executives, however, found that most in the industry are convinced this is not just a pandemic-related boom. People who believe gaming newcomers will be loath to drop their devices when concert venues, movie theaters and sports arenas reopen point to what they see as an inherent ""stickiness"" to their products. Gamers build communities and grow accustomed to socializing with their friends and family over rounds of Fortnite or Among Us, the argument goes, and those bonds only strengthen over time.

""If you look at what teens are doing across America -- actually across the globe right now -- this is kind of their social currency,"" said Jaci Hays, the chief operating officer of FaZe Clan, an e-sports conglomerate whose popular gamers can make six or seven figures a year. ""We don't see it slowing down."" Nick Kolcheff, a FaZe Clan member who earns a living streaming Fortnite and Call of Duty to the 4.5 million people following his Nickmercs Twitch channel, said the gaming boom had caused an entire generation of children to idolize famous streamers just as they would professional athletes. ""There's a real commitment, there's a real addiction,"" he said. ""After those teeth sink in, it's kind of hard to bob and weave and get out.""

Mr. Kolcheff declined to say how much money he makes from Twitch, but a recent study by the online lender CashNetUSA estimated that he earns more than $1.7 million annually from the platform. Twitch itself has had a banner year and now draws nearly 27 million average daily visitors, up from 17.5 million toward the beginning of 2020. The site, which is owned by Amazon, has hired hundreds of people this year, and is seeing nongaming live streams like cooking, travel, music and fitness flourish as well, said its chief operating officer, Sara Clemens. Ms. Clemens argued that the ecosystem Twitch had built could outlast the pandemic.

""When people have built bonds on Twitch, when communities have formed around creators, those are incredibly durable over time, and so we are optimistic that those will sustain,"" she said. There are reasons for hesitation, however, despite many industry leaders' rosy forecasts. Joost van Dreunen, a New York University professor who studies the business of video games, said that if gaming companies felt as optimistic about the industry's future as they claimed, there would have been a slate of acquisitions and investments over the past several months. ""It's strange to me that the industry, in this moment of incredible momentum, has failed or refused to use it as tinder to just light a fire,"" he said. ""Why hasn't the top brass in the games industry taken more risk?"" Some companies have made moves, as when Microsoft spent $7.5 billion in September to buy ZeniMax Media and its host of game studios. But an overall dearth of acquisitions, Mr. van Dreunen said, provides an opportunity for companies like Google and Amazon to force their way into the market by buying studios themselves.","The video game industry has notched record spending and profit in 2020, but to sustain its growth, it must prepare to compete with the return of concerts, movie theaters and live sports.",d69221f3-2050-5c59-b262-85a7d4a83c5c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/13/business/13consoles-print1/00consoles1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=38004786c39aebc50a5284b0882e7f6f7a46aaa4480e60d37d68bcbee1042afe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"J.B.

Science,"Was a Tiny Mummy in the Atacama an Alien? No, but the Real Story Is Almost as Strange",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/science/ata-mummy-alien-chile.html,"A mummified skeleton from the Atacama Desert in Chile has been described as ""alien."" But genetic analysis shows that she was human and may have had a previously unknown bone disorder.

Was a Tiny Mummy in the Atacama an Alien? No, but the Real Story Is Almost as Strange

Nearly two decades ago, the rumors began: In the Atacama Desert of northern Chile, someone had discovered a tiny mummified alien. An amateur collector exploring a ghost town was said to have come across a white cloth in a leather pouch. Unwrapping it, he found a six-inch-long skeleton. Despite its size, the skeleton was remarkably complete. It even had hardened teeth. And yet there were striking anomalies: it had 10 ribs instead of the usual 12, giant eye sockets and a long skull that ended in a point. Ata, as the remains came to be known, ended up in a private collection, but the rumors continued, fueled in part by a U.F.O. documentary in 2013 that featured the skeleton. On Thursday, a team of scientists presented a very different explanation for Ata -- one without aliens, but intriguing in its own way.

Ata's bones contain DNA that not only shows she was human, but that she belonged to the local population. What's more, the researchers identified in her DNA a group of mutations in genes related to bone development. Some of these mutations might be responsible for the skeleton's bizarre form, causing a hereditary disorder never before documented in humans. Antonio Salas Ellacuriaga, a geneticist at the University of Santiago de Compostela in Spain who was not involved in the new study, called it ""a very beautiful example of how genomics can help to disentangle an anthropological and archaeological dilemma."" ""DNA autopsies,"" as Dr. Ellacuriaga calls them, could help shed light on medical disorders ""by looking to the past to understand the present."" The research, published in the journal Genome Research, began in 2012, when Garry P. Nolan, an immunologist at Stanford University, got wind of the U.F.O. documentary, ""Sirius,"" while it was still in production.

Dr. Nolan emailed the producers and offered to look for DNA in the mummy. The skeleton's owner agreed to X-ray images as well as bone marrow samples taken from the ribs and right humerus. Once Dr. Nolan and his colleagues received the samples, they were able to retrieve fragments of DNA from bone marrow cells without much struggle. ""We could tell this was human right away,"" said Atul Butte, a computational biologist at the University of California, San Francisco, and a co-author of the new study. The scientists eventually managed to reconstruct much of Ata's genome. She was a girl, they found, most closely related to indigenous Chileans. But she also had a substantial amount of European ancestry. The scientists have not carried out any precise dating of the skeleton, so they can't say exactly when Ata lived. But her European heritage suggested it was sometime after Chile was colonized in the 1500s.

After death, DNA disintegrates into fragments, which become smaller over the centuries. Ata's DNA fragments are still large, another clue that she's less than 500 years old. While her elongated head was striking, it wasn't the strangest feature of Ata's skeleton. Despite being the size of a human fetus, about the length of a pen, her bones were as developed in some ways as those of a 6-year-old.

Ralph S. Lachman, an expert on hereditary bone diseases at Stanford University, examined her X-rays. He concluded that her constellation of symptoms did not match any known disease. The scientists reasoned that Ata might have had mutations for a disorder that had never before been described. Sanchita Bhattacharya, a researcher in Dr. Butte's lab, searched for mutations in Ata's DNA and identified 2.7 million variants throughout the genome. She whittled this list to 54 rare mutations that could potentially shut down the gene in which they were located. ""I was amazed by how much you can tell from the genetic blueprint,"" said Ms. Bhattacharya. Many of those genes, it turned out, are involved in building skeletons. Some have already been linked to conditions ranging from scoliosis to dwarfism to having an abnormal number of ribs. But some of Ata's mutations are new to science. It's possible some caused her skeleton to mature quickly even while failing to grow to normal stature. Ms. Bhattacharya speculates that such a disorder would have caused the child to be stillborn. And she stressed that these mutations are, for now, only theoretical candidates. Other experts concurred. ""There is no single slam-dunk finding that explains the bizarre appearance of this individual,"" said Daniel G. MacArthur, a geneticist at the Broad Institute who was not involved in the study. Yet understanding what happened to Ata might shed light on skeletal deformities seen today. That may require engineering stem cells with each of the 54 mutations, growing them in a dish, and then looking for telling changes in their development.","Known as ""Ata,"" the six-inch-long skeleton was discovered in Chile and may have had genetic mutations causing a bone disorder never before documented.",a2060731-1519-5c7f-9d45-3ada473f15ec,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/24/science/24SCI-ZIMMER/27SCI-ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=af5578cc82f52f45c634682944ca063c3e9ee06abc717502b84107d44652d858&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A mummified skeleton from the Atacama Desert in Chile has been described as &ldquo;alien.&rdquo; But genetic analysis shows that she was human and may have had a previously unknown bone disorder.,a2060731-1519-5c7f-9d45-3ada473f15ec,N24News/imgs/a2060731-1519-5c7f-9d45-3ada473f15ec.jpg,2
Music,Review: Semyon Bychkov Makes the Philharmonic an Event,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/arts/music/review-new-york-philharmonic-semyon-bychkov.html,"David Geffen Hall has lately been witness to dueling interpretations of Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony. Last month, Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic played a version here attuned to the work's tragic and sardonic potential.

On Thursday, the Russian-born conductor Semyon Bychkov began a two-week stint with the New York Philharmonic with a program featuring the same symphony. And his interpretation of one of Shostakovich's most familiar pieces took some risks.

Many contemporary approaches to the Fifth duly observe its complex historical context. (It was written with at least a partial goal -- though how partial remains in dispute -- of regaining the favor of Soviet censors.) But unlike some other conductors, Mr. Bychkov doesn't seem interested in pointing out stray subversive riffs in the score. Instead, he allows Shostakovich's restless invention to sound joyful for its own sake.

With the Philharmonic, this approach resulted in an opening of rare propulsion. Rather than sounding gravely wounded, the first movement had reserves of noir-film savoir faire. Still plenty dark, yet also steely.","The Russian-born conductor began a two-week stint with a program featuring Shostakovich's Fifth Symphony, in a performance joyful for its own sake.",d38d9bcb-c7e8-542f-83e0-fc59ef94b98a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/19/arts/19bychkov/19bychkov-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=45a5e06d40787192c0d441774e98848f0a0ea3a4a867fdacb9dd50c6c148ee34&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Semyon Bychkov conducting the New York Philharmonic at David Geffen Hall on Thursday.,d38d9bcb-c7e8-542f-83e0-fc59ef94b98a,N24News/imgs/d38d9bcb-c7e8-542f-83e0-fc59ef94b98a.jpg,12
Automobiles,Mild-Mannered Redesign Lands in a Tough Neighborhood,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/automobiles/autoreviews/mild-mannered-redesign-in-a-tough-neighborhood.html,"NOW is not the time for Honda to rest the updated 2012 Civic on its ancestors' laurels. The compact car market is stacked. Hyundai redesigned the Elantra for 2011, and it's better in every way except where it was already ahead -- it is still keenly priced and covered by a 10-year powertrain warranty. The new Kia Forte can't be taken for granted, the Mazda 3 is slick, Subaru has a nice niche with its all-wheel-drive Impreza and Volkswagen has re-engineered the Jetta for American mass consumption. Then there is Ford's all-new Focus, a huge leap forward, and even Chevrolet, burdened with a 50-year legacy of wretched small cars, is booking big sales with its pretty good Cruze. It's a tough crowd, and half-efforts and skin-deep revisions aren't likely to be enough to rise to the top.

But that's exactly what Honda has delivered with the somewhat-new ninth-generation Civic. The car is, for the most part, a mild revamping of the eighth-generation coupes and sedans that went on sale for the 2006 model year. Most of the mechanical elements carry over in a new shell that's even less visually interesting than before. Maybe this isn't a surprise. Most of Honda's recent new products haven't been inspired designs, and in August, Consumer Reports pointedly left the 2012 Civic LX off its list of recommended cars. The Civic is still a good car -- it's a Honda, after all -- but it is not the gold standard that the Civic had long been. And it's no longer the car to which every other member of its class must be compared. I tested three 2012 Civics: the mainstream $19,425 LX and the up-market $24,225 EX-L sedans (the L is for leather), both equipped with automatic transmissions, along with the performance-oriented $24,655 Si coupe that comes only with a manual gearbox. I skipped the DX stripper model and the version fueled by natural gas. The expansive Civic line also includes the higher-mileage HF and Hybrid sedans. Because of the tsunami that struck Japan in March, availability of some parts for the 2012 Civics has been restricted. According to Jon Fitzsimmons, a Honda spokesman, though most Civics sold here are assembled in Indiana and Ontario, production has not yet fully recovered.

In silhouette, the new Civic sedan doesn't look much different from the outgoing model, though the wheelbase has shrunk 1.2 inches, to 105.1 inches. Honda says the percentage of high-strength steel in the structure has increased to 55 percent, from 50 percent, resulting in a 7 percent drop in body weight and a 10 percent increase in ""static and dynamic"" rigidity. What's disappointing is the anonymous, blunter nose and a tail that appears to have been ripped off the hind end of a 2001 Toyota Camry and then shrunk in the wash. The 2006 Civic still looks newer than the 2012 redesign. The basic interior design also updates what the 2006 model established. As before, the dashboard is divided into two tiers with a tachometer ahead of the steering wheel and a digital speedometer one level higher. The new elements include an information screen to the right of the speedometer, and Eco Assist bar graphics alongside the speedometer that light, on the LX and EX, in gradient shades of color to represent how environmentally conscious your driving style is. It's easy to glow indulgent blue or righteous green; the challenge is to maintain an even shade of turquoise. On the hotter Civic Si, the Eco Assist bars shine red and stay red. The Civic's seats, no matter the trim level, are well shaped, nicely padded and perfectly upholstered -- paragons of seating virtue. And the leather on the EX-L is tufted on the seats, as in an old Buick Park Avenue. The steering wheel is the perfect diameter, and there are audio, information-display and cruise-control switches fitted neatly into its spokes. The ergonomics are just about perfect, with intuitive ventilation controls, big cup holders and plenty of receptacles for flotsam. Beyond all that, the cabin isn't just roomy -- Honda claims a 1.6-inch increase in rear legroom -- it feels roomy, too.

There are, however, too many hard plastic panels on the dashboard and doors. Certain switches, most prominently the single knob that's charged with doing too much to control the standard audio system, feel cheap to the touch and don't operate with, well, Honda-like precision. The Civic has taken a step back in tactile satisfaction. In previous-generation Civics a small LED was embedded in the overhead console to light the shifter. That's just gone. Honda took some weight out of the interior materials, and it shows in both the quality and the features. The LX and EX-L are both powered by a carryover 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine with a single overhead cam and 16 valves. Enhanced by Honda's signature i-VTEC variable valve timing system, the 140-horsepower engine is easygoing, though it lacks leading-edge direct-injection technology and its output is modest for the class. More disappointing, the engine comes hooked only to 5-speed transmissions -- manual or automatic in the LX, automatic only in the EX. In contrast, the Hyundai Elantra's 1.8-liter 4 pumps out 148 horsepower and its manual and automatic transmissions each have 6 forward gears.

Press a big green button on the EX or LX and the car goes into Econ mode: the action of the electronic throttle is slowed, the automatic transmission's software is altered to keep revs down and the climate control system restrains itself from power-sucking extremes. For most drivers most of the time, puttering around in Econ makes little noticeable difference -- until you try to accelerate to freeway speeds. What is annoying in the LX is tire noise. Compared with the LX, the EX models get additional blankets of sound insulation on the rear wheel wells and use thicker material in the doors, in addition to the extra shushing on the firewall. So while the drone of the EX's P205/55R16 all-season radials is subdued on most road surfaces, the LX's P195/65R15 all-season radials roar like a Kraft Foods factory grinding out Maxwell House. That's not good in a car that costs nearly $20,000. According to Honda, the LX and EX suspension systems are tuned identically save for the different wheels and tires. But the LX's ride motions seem more sudden, jarring and stiffer. Honda says there is only about a one-pound difference between the weight of each of the LX's 15-inch steel wheel and tire combinations and the EX's 16-inch alloy wheel and tire assemblies. And while the LX and EX tires differ in size, in general construction and specification they're close. Probably it's the LX's additional noise that makes it seem to ride rougher -- it's messing with my brain. The difference in tires doesn't make much difference in how the two Civic sedans handle. The electric power steering in both is among the best in the class, the all-independent suspension is tenacious, the antilock brakes work well and the stability and traction control systems are unobtrusive. If only the transmission had a nice overdrive sixth gear for cruising and five more closely spaced cogs beneath it for squirting through urban traffic. You know, like the Hyundai Elantra's. Atop the sound deadening, the EX gets things like a fold-down armrest in the middle of the back seat, heated side mirrors, two more speakers, some additional power outlets and a power moonroof, so it's worth the additional $1,850 over the LX (before adding leather).

But as a value proposition, both the Civic LX and the EX pale in comparison with the more powerful, more frugal, better warranted, and similarly priced Elantra GLS and Limited. Particularly now that, according to Auto Lease Guide, the Hondas and Hyundais are likely to retain their values similarly. The 2012 Civic Si is a different beast altogether, whether as a coupe or a sedan. In looks, the two-door body is more changed than the four-door: more streamlined, more heavily sculptured and likely to be more polarizing among potential buyers. But the Si's big change is the engine: the 197-horsepower 2-liter 4 used in 2006-11 Si models has been swapped for a 201-horse version of Honda's 2.4-liter 4 similar to the one in the Acura TSX. The extra displacement of the new engine brings with it a big gain in low-end and midrange torque -- the old Si made its 139 pound-feet of peak torque at 6,100 r.p.m., while the new Si's peak of 170 pound-feet comes at 4,400 r.p.m. But that extra torque carries a price. One of the great joys of the previous Si is that it could be revved to 8,000 every time the driver wanted to merge into traffic without attracting every cop within 30 miles. And it made a wonderful, wailing induction noise as the i-VTEC system transitioned to more aggressive high-r.p.m. cam profiles, making a sound like a Formula One engine hitting its stride. The new Si's engine revs only to 7,000 r.p.m. and it doesn't sound special at all. Of course Honda can point to cries from reviewers and previous Si owners for more torque, but what they really wanted was both more torque and the high-revving thrills of the 2-liter engine. There's now a ""sequential rev limit indicator"" that tells the driver when the engine is approaching its redline. That's a poor substitute for the old Si's glorious growl. Fortunately the new Si still gets Honda's great short-throw 6-speed transmission, fantastic front bucket seats, and a suspension that gets instant responses from the 215/45R17 Michelin all-season performance tires. And yes, it's an easier car to live with in traffic and it gets slightly better fuel economy than the outgoing Si (31 vs. 29 m.p.g. on the highway).",The somewhat-new ninth-generation Civic has arrived in a competitive market and is mostly a mild revamping of the coupes and sedans that went on sale for 2006.,63e06564-e836-5f37-b252-2bc487d0b926,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/25/automobiles/25CIVIC1/25CIVIC1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=209&w=600&s=9742bf0f48b348292d1ded4e8f3bb5d65e1d8fc42f88817dbd191d2fd4c936ad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"MULTIPLE BIRTHS A few members of the ever-growing Civic family: From left, EX-L sedan, Civic Hybrid, EX coupe and Si coupe.",63e06564-e836-5f37-b252-2bc487d0b926,N24News/imgs/63e06564-e836-5f37-b252-2bc487d0b926.jpg,23
Fashion & Style,An Alternative to Bollywood Style,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/fashion/bodice-woolmark-prize-winner.html,"NEW DELHI -- Off a smoggy, six lane highway in India's capital, past a Catholic church and an elegant mosque painted white and green, is a low-slung, 1950s-style bungalow on a pink bougainvillea-lined lane where wild peacocks roam. This is the studio of Ruchika Sachdeva, the women's wear designer British Vogue called ""a bellwether for a new kind of generational change."" ""I don't want to make more things,"" Ms. Sachdeva said, as she sorted through swatches of fine Indian hand-loomed textiles. ""I want to make clothes that are meaningful for both the wearer and the world around them."" Ms. Sachdeva, 31, moved one large step closer to her goal earlier this year when she won the International Woolmark Prize for women's wear (the same prize that Karl Lagerfeld and Yves Saint Laurent won years ago, and which was reintroduced in 2012 as a consciously inclusive and wide-ranging hallmark of new talent) with her label, Bodice Studio. Now, with release of the Woolmark collection at retailers including Mytheresa and Farfetch this summer, her approach is about to go global.

""I feel when you are from India, people only focus on tradition, but when I use traditional craft, my idea is to ensure that it's not limited to the place it comes from,"" Ms. Sachdeva said. ""Growing up in West Delhi, I often felt restricted. There was just too much bling and an excess of embroidery on everything. My mother always taught me the values of Sanskar balance, of being secure in yourself, and I feel that has had a big influence on me and the clothes I create.""

Fine gauge merino wool, some of it hand-woven in the Himalayas, is used to create pieces that are structured and fluid. An innovative binding technique results in knife-sharp, color-contrast pleats. The fall collection, which ranges from $400 to $1,900, includes midi-length skirts, prim but sporty dresses and a standout powder pink wool suit dyed with madder (a flowering plant with roots containing a compound that produces a nontoxic dye) by artisans in central India. A twist on the traditional tailored suit, it has graphic lines that make references to classic sportswear, but its graceful flared cut evokes 18th-century Indian dancers of the Mughal Empire, a constant inspiration in Ms. Sachdeva's work.

Indeed, Bodice Studio shatters many stereotypes of Indian design as shaped by its Bollywood-influenced bridal market or the rapturous kitsch excesses of diaspora designers like Manish Arora and Ashish. Perhaps that is why, since its introduction in 2011, it has become a go-to label for Indian women across the creative industries. Ms. Sachdeva has a presence that exudes quiet authority, gleaned in part from becoming the first woman in her family to study abroad. She left Delhi in 2007 to attend the London College of Fashion. ""My mother got calls from extended family, saying, 'Ruchika's going to come back with so many Westernized ideas,'"" she said. ""They were focused on the idea of me being a good, dutiful daughter who shouldn't be allowed to go off and study by herself. You can send your son but not your daughter. There's that kind of double standard."" Her mother resisted the family pressure and, Ms. Sachdeva said, ""always told my sister and I that we should become women of our own means, not be dependent, work hard and run our own lives. She was the feminist in our house."" The London College of Fashion led to an internship with Vivienne Westwood. That, led to the decision to return to India to create clothing that gives expression to the wealth of craft and hand-woven textiles that often languish undervalued in the place of their birth.

Such challenges came into play with the Woolmark Prize collection. ""There were so many things I wanted to do that often get pushed to the side in the process of running a fashion business,"" Ms. Sachdeva said. ""The Woolmark process gave me a full year to focus on textiles, to experiment with craft and also with cutting-edge technology, and to push the boundaries with color."" A pleated shirt and pants, for example, is tinted an earthy pink made from madder. A bottle green bomber in light wool with navy ribbed cuffs and pocket flaps is both sporty and elegant, the sleeves and front breast panels lent abstract surface texture with a traditional kantha (running) stitch inspired by an old family tradition and lore. ""In Bengal women use kantha to recycle old, worn-out saris into quilts,"" Ms. Sachdeva said. ""Traditionally, it's believed that the bonds of love between the women who wore the saris, and the care with which they stitch layers of them into quilts, makes them auspicious, protecting newborns who are wrapped in them."" An original way of thinking about recycling, and perhaps, new Indian aesthetics, too.","Bodice, the winner of the Woolmark prize, wants to change how the world sees Indian fashion.",51813e68-ecbd-5298-b55f-103e5688a5b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/13/fashion/00BODICE-1/00BODICE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c5af6b9096f8f78f85864659fdfcb0372a5b690451fa7654d0e708d559d4752e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A look from Bodice Studio, which shatters many stereotypes of Indian design.",51813e68-ecbd-5298-b55f-103e5688a5b0,N24News/imgs/51813e68-ecbd-5298-b55f-103e5688a5b0.jpg,19

Southern California is home to almost 24 million, yet few picture books show us life there, or tell stories about its vibrant immigrant communities. This delightful book bursts into the gap: A girl named Daisy takes a spin on the back of her carpenter papi's motorcycle, greeting friends and relatives, noting historical murals and stopping at his work site. ""Even in all that noise, my papi's voice touches everything,"" she says. There's no earthshaking story, just the sweet rumble of family love, neighborhood pride, the dignity of work and the joy of a fast ride. Yet Quintero's warm, economical text and the desert-sunset tones of Pena's comics-inflected art feel like a revelation.

Nothing beats a secret place, and even better if, as in this enthralling story, it's hidden in a public space. Someone's calling Hannah, but she's decided to go live inside a bush in the park, wearing a feather cape, making a fire and befriending an Odd Furry Creature. Or did she just draw the whole thing? The homage here to ""Where the Wild Things Are"" may be subtle, but it brings a smile.

Summer's almost over, and the narrator of this sweetly mysterious first children's book by the literary novelist Choi is dreading the start of first grade. A family camping trip brings him face to face with a tiger -- one that talks. With the tiger's help, the boy catches a fish and even, in a stunning wordless sequence, ventures into the woods at night to leap across rocks and howl at the moon. Rocco's (""Blackout"") art gives an emotionally astute story even more depth.

Dance,Clive Barnes Award Winners Are Announced,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/arts/dance/clive-barnes-award-winners-are-announced.html,"The seventh annual Clive Barnes Awards, which honor outstanding young performers in theater and dance, were announced on Monday at the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. The award for theater, presented by Joel Grey, went to Khris Davis for his performance in ""The Royale"" at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. The award for dance, presented by the New York City Ballet principal Ashley Bouder, was given to Indiana Woodward, also of City Ballet; Ms. Woodward's new roles in 2016 included the title role in the company's ""La Sylphide.""

These awards commemorate the critic Clive Barnes (1927-2008), and the winners receive $5,000 each. The finalists for the awards also receive cash prizes.

The actor Dave Thomas Brown, a winner of the 2015 award, observed at the ceremony Monday that this prize was, happily, the opposite of a lifetime achievement award. It serves as ""an investment into the performer's craft,"" he said. Having made his debuts on television and Broadway since receiving the Clive Barnes award, he said, he used the money to cover the initiation dues for the Screen Actors Guild.

Gabe Stone Shayer, the other 2015 winner, who dances with American Ballet Theater, said at the ceremony that he had invested the money in private coaching and in work outside his company. He observed that the award had inspired ambition, passion and humility.","The annual prizes, for young performers in theater and dance, were given to Khris Davis, an actor, and Indiana Woodward of New York City Ballet.",0c785cf6-10e8-58e9-9b0b-f29b58f6cc70,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/11/arts/11barnes/11barnes-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4b61b84499ce0e44cb556f58cce560cdb64dab5aed313abdd69fa6c203338d00&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Indiana Woodward, of New York City Ballet.",0c785cf6-10e8-58e9-9b0b-f29b58f6cc70,N24News/imgs/0c785cf6-10e8-58e9-9b0b-f29b58f6cc70.jpg,6
Music,"Review: Philip Glass Is Celebrated, but Not With His Best",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/arts/music/review-louisiana-philharmonic-carnegie-hall.html,"Over the last decade, Carnegie Hall's composer in residence position has tended to go to veteran iconoclasts whose innovations have taken root in the broader classical scene. Meredith Monk, Louis Andriessen and Kaija Saariaho, for example, have all been celebrated with the concert series that come with the Carnegie post, the Debs Composer's Chair.

I've noticed, listening to a range of these series, that programs devoted exclusively to the chosen composer's works are often impressive. Less satisfying, on the whole, have been the concerts in which the composer is tucked -- or, more to the point, jammed -- into a broader concept or next to other works.

This year Philip Glass holds the chair. And Tuesday evening was his turn with that latter format. In its Carnegie debut, the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra and its music director, Carlos Miguel Prieto, played two of his lesser-known orchestral pieces -- ""Days and Nights in Rocinha"" (1997) and the Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra (2000) -- on a program that also included Silvestre Revueltas's ""La Noche de los Mayas.""","Mr. Glass, Carnegie Hall's composer in residence this season, had two orchestral works featured on a concert by the Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra.",96ad59ca-9f17-5d3f-9dc7-27ec2a63031b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/01/arts/01lpo/01lpo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7ecc17f53f7a412008ff827d4183af8d7eaae1d76a7c1659f1bb99caa37b8515&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Louisiana Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Carlos Miguel Prieto, performing Philip Glass's Concerto Fantasy for Two Timpanists and Orchestra at Carnegie Hall this week.",96ad59ca-9f17-5d3f-9dc7-27ec2a63031b,N24News/imgs/96ad59ca-9f17-5d3f-9dc7-27ec2a63031b.jpg,12
Health,They Thought Hemophilia Was a 'Lifelong Thing.' They May Be Wrong.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/health/hemophilia-gene-therapy.html,"They Thought Hemophilia Was a 'Lifelong Thing.' They May Be Wrong.

Scientists are edging closer to defeating a longtime enemy of human health: hemophilia, the inability to form blood clots. After trying for decades to develop a gene therapy to treat this disease, researchers are starting to succeed. In recent experiments, brief intravenous infusions of powerful new treatments have rid patients -- for now, at least -- of a condition that has shadowed them all their lives. There have been setbacks -- years of failed clinical trials and dashed hopes. Just last week, a biotech company reported that gene therapy mostly stopped working in two of 12 patients in one trial. But the general trajectory has been forward, and new treatments are expected by many experts to be approved in a few years.

No one is saying yet that hemophilia will be cured. Currently the gene therapy -- which uses a virus to deliver a new gene to cells -- can only be used once. If it stops working, the patients lose the benefits. For now, ""we are anticipating that this is a once-in-a-lifetime treatment,"" said Dr. Steven Pipe, director of the hemophilia and coagulation disorders program at the University of Michigan and a lead investigator of a clinical trial conducted by the biotech company BioMarin. The successful treatments are so recent it is hard to say how long they will last. But for the few patients who have been through the clinical trials successfully, life after treatment is so different that it's something of a shock. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] There are 20,000 hemophilia patients in the United States who lack one of two proteins needed for blood to clot. It's a genetic condition, and the gene for blood clotting sits on the X chromosome . Virtually all people with hemophilia are men. Those most severely affected must inject themselves every couple of days with the missing proteins, clotting factor VIII or factor IX. The shots keep hemophiliacs alive, but levels of clotting proteins drop between injections.

Even with regular injections, people with hemophilia risk uncontrolled bleeding into a muscle or joint, or even the brain. They must be extremely careful. Once bleeding begins, a joint may bulge as the joint space fills with blood. When the bleeding stops, the joint may be damaged. Even a routine flight is risky, said Mark Skinner, a 57-year-old attorney in Washington with hemophilia who is a past president of the World Federation of Hemophilia. ""Carrying luggage around, you can twist the wrong way and immediately trigger a bleed,"" he said. ""Or you can get hit with a cart going down the aisle."" People with hemophilia often are taught as children to avoid most sports and to find professions that will not require much physical activity. Many move to cities to gain easier access to treatment. They may change jobs to get insurance needed to cover medical bills for hospitalizations and surgeries that can reach $1 million a year, plus an average of $250,000 to $300,000 a year for the clotting proteins. (The shots alone can cost as much as $1 million per year.) Despite their vigilance, most with severe disease eventually develop permanent joint damage from bleeds, often leading to surgery for ankle fusion or hip or knee replacements at an early age. Most live with chronic pain from past bleeds. For older patients, there is an additional complication. The clotting proteins used in the 1980s were contaminated with H.I.V. and hepatitis C. Nearly everyone with hemophilia got infected.

Now, though, researchers see the start of a new era. ""It's a really optimistic time,"" said Dr. Lindsey A. George, a hematologist at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and a principal investigator for Spark Therapeutics, one of several companies developing gene therapies for hemophilia. The goal of gene therapy is to reduce or eliminate patients' need for injections with clotting factor and to reduce the number of bleeds. The gene to be inserted depends on whether the patient has hemophilia A, caused by a mutation in the gene for factor VIII, or hemophilia B, caused by a mutation in the gene for clotting factor IX. Although the symptoms are the same with both forms of the disease, hemophilia A is by far the most common. A handful of biotech companies are now rushing to get their gene therapies to market. Spark, with gene therapy for hemophilia B, and BioMarin, another biotech company, with a similar treatment for hemophilia A, are starting large, final-phase clinical trials. (Pfizer is taking over the development of the Spark drug.) Results from the two companies' preliminary trials were not perfect. Patients in Biomarin's hemophilia A trial got, on average, normal or above normal levels of factor VIII in their blood, but in the second year, those levels dropped to a median of 46 percent. It's not clear why. Patients in Spark's hemophilia B trial only reached on average 35 percent of normal blood levels of factor IX. But those levels have remained steady for the two years they have been followed. The good news is that those levels are sufficient for blood to clot, because normal levels are more than people need. After dreaming of a cure for decades, some treated patients are trying to adjust to newfound freedom.

John Brissette, 39, a computer user interface designer in Hanover, Mass., said hemophilia A always dominated his life. He spent childhood yearning to be active like other kids. But bleeds into his joints put him on crutches for days at a time or forced him to keep his arm in a sling. He would be out of school for a week, then back, then out again with yet another bleed. He was embarrassed by nosebleeds that would not stop. As an adult, he had to have his damaged ankle bones fused. His elbow, after numerous bleeds over the years, gives him chronic pain. Foreseeing more pain and injuries in the years to come, Mr. Brissette began seeking out gene therapy clinical trials. Eventually, he enrolled in a Spark trial. (The company has an experimental hemophilia A drug, too.) He received a single infusion on April 19. His blood levels of factor VIII rose from zero to as high as 30 percent of normal and so far have stayed there. ""I have not had a single bruise. I have not had a single bleed,"" Mr. Brissette said. He has not given himself a shot of clotting factor since the procedure.

At first, hemophilia seemed ideal for gene therapy. Normal blood levels of clotting proteins range widely, from 50 percent to 150 percent of average. A gene therapy for the disease would not have to provide much to be effective for patients. And researchers knew just which genes to insert into patients' liver cells. The genes for hemophilia A and B were isolated in the early 1980s. But the research proved difficult, and the first positive result was reported just a few years ago by scientists at University College London and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. They treated ten patients with hemophilia B and managed to increase their blood levels of factor IX to between 2 percent to 6 percent of normal. In those patients, clotting proteins have persisted at those levels ever since. Then scientists stumbled upon an unexpected bonanza. They found a man in Padua, Italy, who had a genetic mutation that made cells churn out as much as 12 times the usual amounts of factor IX. Investigators realized that they could put the mutated gene into a virus and use it to insert the mutated gene into the cells of patients with hemophilia B.

Hemophilia would be ""a lifelong thing,"" said Jay Konduros. Then the brothers joined Spark's gene therapy trial for hemophilia B. The actual infusion of the experimental drug was anticlimactic, Jay Konduros recalled. He walked into a hospital in Philadelphia, sat in a chair and had an intravenous drip for half an hour. That was it. Now levels of factor IX in Jay Konduros's blood are around 50 percent. Bill, who also joined the trial, has levels closer to 75 percent. Neither has required any factor IX since their gene therapy. Both struggle to accept the fact that, for the moment, their lives are very different. ""When I hit myself or strain a muscle or twist, I immediately revert to thinking like a hemophiliac,"" Bill Konduros said. ""You go on high alert. Is the ache spreading? Is it throbbing?"" One day in May, Jay fell, landing on his forearms. Both wrists hit hard on concrete, and he struck the left side of his thigh, already damaged from previous bleeds. He took a few deep breaths and told himself, ""You will be O.K., you will be O.K."" He worried, anticipating disaster. That night he stretched. He examined himself. Nothing seemed damaged. He woke up in wee hours of the morning and nervously examined himself again. He was fine. He waited three days to call his brother and tell him: He was now a normal person who had a minor fall. ""You hear a lot of things described as miracles or miraculous,"" Bill said. ""I guess I would say this truly is.""",Experimental gene therapies have yielded promising results in early trials.

Global Business,"To Restore Reputation of a Renault Founder, Family Goes to Court",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/20/business/global/20renault.html,"Helene Renault-Dingli with a portrait of her father, Jean-Louis Renault, and a bust of Louis Renault in the background, is one of seven family members seeking to overturn the nationalization of the car company.

PARIS -- Nearly 70 years after the pioneering automaker Louis Renault died in a French prison, accused of collaborating with the Nazis, his grandchildren are seeking to restore his reputation -- and gain compensation for what they say was the illegal confiscation of his car company by the state. Family members, whose efforts at legal redress had been stymied since the de Gaulle provisional government nationalized Renault on Jan. 16, 1945, have seized on a new law that allows individuals to challenge the constitutionality of government actions in the courts. If they win, they could receive well over 100 million euros, or $143 million, from the state, their lawyer said. The family insists, however, that cash is not the motivating factor. ""It's not my priority to monetize this,"" said Helene Renault-Dingli, one of the seven grandchildren seeking to overturn the nationalization. ""We're fighting to win back his place, but no amount of compensation could make up for this violence that has been experienced by our family."" No one disputes that Renault worked for the Germans; virtually all of France's big industrial groups did. What has been contested since the liberation of the country is whether what happened to the company soon afterward was legal.

Renault, like the other major French automakers -- Citroen, Peugeot and the truck maker Berliet -- produced vehicles for the Third Reich. Renault's tank unit was directly controlled by the Germans, while its auto and aircraft units, as with the other companies, were under French management, supervised by executives from Daimler-Benz. Yet Citroen and Peugeot were not nationalized after the war; their owners were deemed to have been patriots, and Berliet eventually won back its private status. Mr. Renault died in prison on Oct. 24, 1944, before he could face trial. He had aphasia, and the official report lists uremia as the cause of death. His family contends that he was murdered, although they have no proof. The case illustrates the continued sensitivity here about the German occupation, in which Hitler imposed his will on the French nation from 1940 to 1944, turning the country into an appendage of the Nazi war machine. The Germans depended in large measure on the willingness of the French police, industrialists and managers to carry out their bidding. On a more fundamental basis, millions of people faced regular choices about whether or how far to compromise with the occupiers to survive. That makes black-and-white assessments of many actions difficult.

""It's extremely difficult to say to what extent Louis Renault should be considered a collaborator,"" said Patrick Fridenson, a professor of business history at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in Paris and the author of a book on Renault. Mr. Renault, he said, ""ran the risk of complete dispossession if he resisted the Germans."" Monika Ostler Riess, a German scholar who investigated French and German sources while researching a book on Renault's history during the occupation, said she had found no evidence that Mr. Renault collaborated any more than his peers. ""He just tried to save what he had, what he had built,"" she said. The alternative to cooperating with the occupiers was to see the Germans take over his company, she added. Mr. Renault, along with two brothers, founded the auto company in 1899. After traveling to the United States and seeing the revolutionary production techniques of Henry Ford, he introduced American management methods in France. During World War I, he led the development of battle tanks, including the Renault FT17, the first tank to employ a rotating turret, and was lauded as a patriot afterward. By the time World War II began in Europe in 1939, Renault was a highly diversified conglomerate, the biggest industrial group in France, employing about 40,000 people. Mr. Renault held 96 percent of the capital, with family members and top managers holding the rest. While no one has produced evidence that he was sympathetic to the Third Reich's ideological goals, there is no evidence that he ever aided the resistance or de Gaulle's forces, either. (Mr. Fridenson said more research was needed into related archives, especially in Germany.)

Such actions left him without political allies in the first hectic days of the liberation, as the United States and British armies began driving the Germans out of France and the Gaullists and Communists were taking control. Several photos of Mr. Renault with Hitler, including one at the Berlin Auto Show before the war broke out, also helped to cement his image in France as a Nazi tool. Of all the companies nationalized from 1944 to 1948, only Renault was not indemnified, although the minority shareholders were eventually compensated. Mr. Fridenson said the nationalization policy of de Gaulle's government was partly a means of speeding the modernization of the French economy after the war. As a result, ""the Renault nationalization wasn't a pure sanction,"" he said. ""About half of the argument made by the government at the time hinges on modernization. One rationale was that Renault wasn't making 'people's cars' like Germany and the United States."" Twice before, the family has sought to overturn the ruling and obtain compensation. In 1954, Mr. Renault's son and wife were told by a judge that he could not examine the validity of the ruling by the de Gaulle government. The State Council, the country's highest administrative court, reached the same conclusion in a 1961 appeal.

The descendants' current legal case against the state was made possible by a groundbreaking law enacted in March 2010 that allows citizens to challenge the conformity of legislation with the French Constitution. Supported by President Nicolas Sarkozy as a means of modernizing the French legal system, the law has had several unintended consequences, not least of which has been a flood of cases in the appeals courts. It has already been employed in hundreds of cases, including the trial of Jacques Chirac, the former French president, who is charged with creating fictitious jobs as mayor of Paris. Thierry Levy, a lawyer representing the Renault family, filed the case with a high-level civil court in Paris last week. He estimated the family could receive compensation of more than 100 million euros if the courts find the 1945 nationalization order illegal. The legal question, he said, is not whether Mr. Renault was a collaborator but how his heirs were treated. ""If the government decides to confiscate someone's property,"" Mr. Levy said, ""this person must be judged and declared guilty of something. Otherwise, the confiscation is illegal."" Renault has a market value of about 11.7 billion euros, and the French state maintains a 15.01 percent stake. The company has not discussed the case with the family, said Caroline de Gezelle, a Renault spokeswoman. She declined to comment further. Mrs. Renault-Dingli said the family had no designs on the company but was saddened that her grandfather appeared to have been discredited by a ""small but active minority"" inside the company. Despite the confiscation of Mr. Renault's company, she said, the family has lived comfortably on its inheritance of Mr. Renault's personal fortune. The family won a small victory last July when it used the courts to force a historical museum -- the Memorial Center of Oradour -- to remove from display a photograph of Mr. Renault with Hitler at the Berlin Auto Show in the late 1930s. The photograph had been exhibited alongside a caption that said Renault had built tanks for the German Army.","Nearly 70 years after Louis Renault died in prison, his grandchildren are seeking to restore his reputation — and gain compensation for what they say was the illegal confiscation of his car company.",95bb69d4-a525-5d11-b4ae-e068b7d292ed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/20/business/global/20renault-span/20renault-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=2cd97150a34b257f076298cdd95b0e1e837ccf57144615c0d59421ac66ced133&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Hélène Renault-Dingli with a portrait of her father, Jean-Louis Renault, and a bust of Louis Renault in the background, is one of seven family members seeking to overturn the nationalization of the car company.",95bb69d4-a525-5d11-b4ae-e068b7d292ed,N24News/imgs/95bb69d4-a525-5d11-b4ae-e068b7d292ed.jpg,24
Music,"A German Opera Spotlights the Refugee Crisis, With Refugees",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/12/arts/music/germany-refugee-crisis-opera-munich.html,"MUNICH -- ""We tell the story of Moses because it is actually our story,"" one teenager, a refugee from Afghanistan by way of Iran, said in the Hazaragi dialect to the German-speaking audience at the Bavarian State Opera here on a recent Sunday evening. Others chimed in: ""The story of Moses is also my story,"" they said in French, Kurdish, Greek and Arabic. They were the cast of ""Moses,"" a feel-good yet sobering new production by the Bavarian State Opera's youth program, written for refugees, children of immigrants and born-and-raised Bavarians.

The director Jessica Glause, who created the libretto based on interviews with refugees in the cast, has concocted a blend of humor, horror and youthful energy that hardly feels like a didactic documentary about Europe's refugee crisis. Behind the scenes, ""Moses"" has provided a way to learn German and make friends -- in short, to make the process of migration a little less painful. And audiences have responded favorably: The work's premiere run, last December, sold out, and because of demand, performances were added to the revival at the Munich Opera Festival in July. Theater about the refugee crisis has proliferated in Germany since migration into the country reached its peak in 2016. But rarely has the hot-button issue -- which continues to threaten Chancellor Angela Merkel's power and fuel the rise of the far-right party Alternative for Germany, or AfD -- entered the realm of opera, much less children's opera.

Ms. Gessat said that in the first half of 2016, when the production was still in development, she and her team thought of featuring refugees in the cast -- no musical experience required -- and eventually ""Noye's Fludde"" became simply ""Noah,"" an adaptation that included their stories. That summer, while Ms. Gessat and her colleagues were on vacation, some of the darkest stories from the refugee crisis began to emerge: harrowing boat rides across the Mediterranean Sea that left many dead, and governments struggling to reckon with a massive influx of people in need of homes and livelihood. ""When we came back,"" Ms. Gessat said, ""our idea was suddenly very relevant.""

Among the people she spoke with were Ali Madad Qorbani, a young man from Afghanistan who fled to Iran, then Europe, after his father had disappeared; and Zahra Akhlaqi, also from Afghanistan, whose mother came to Europe first while she and her sister waited in Iran, where, she said, they were forbidden from going to school but would dress up like students at home and play pretend.

Now, their lives are slightly more stable, though just as precarious as any refugee's. Mr. Qorbani is an intern at the Bavarian State Opera, and Ms. Akhlaqi is a bright student who said she learned German in part by reading canonical literature like Goethe's ""Faust"" and Thomas Mann's ""The Magic Mountain."" (She also speaks fluent English.) The heart of ""Moses"" is how they and other refugees in the cast have adjusted to life in Munich. If ""Noah"" was an opera about a journey, then ""Moses"" is about what comes after, with questions about what it means to find a home and how to fit in somewhere new. There are still monologues of how and why some of the cast members came to Europe, but much of the material is about reconciling their faiths and cultures with those of Germany -- including one humorous passage about trying German beer for the first time. But they also describe how they don't always feel welcome, such as a scene in which the plagues in Moses's story give way to one person describing signs near Munich that say refugees overrun Germany like locusts. Moments like this are sobering reminders in an otherwise uplifting story. Life offstage unfolds in much the same way, with stretches of happiness punctuated by harsh reality checks.

At a recent rehearsal, for example, the cast members behaved more like friends than colleagues: greeting each other with hugs, and cheerfully working together on a challenging, even avant-garde production. Away from the opera house, Ms. Akhlaqi is close with Mila Stephan, one of the Germans, who said they like to hang out and cook Italian food together. But there was also the day one of the cast members, a Nigerian refugee named Unity Okojie, went missing. He had performed in the premiere run of ""Moses"" in January, but could not be found for the revival this summer. Ms. Gessat said he could still be in Munich, or back in Africa; they just don't know. His absence has been written into the show. At the moment where he should be making his entrance onstage, Ms. Stephan and Martin Lucke, another German cast member, address the audience, telling them what Unity would be saying if he were there and explaining the instability of life for sub-Saharan refugees. Toward the end of the opera, Ms. Stephan and Mr. Lucke sing ""Unity's School,"" a catchy English-language number about assimilation; it later served as a crowd-pleasing encore that had even the usher, Stefan Schubert, dancing and mouthing the words. The Bavarian State Opera's youth program will return next season with another refugee-minded adaptation: an Adam and Eve story, based on Haydn's ""The Creation."" While it is in development, the AfD party -- with its nationalistic criticisms of state-funded institutions that engage topics like the refugee crisis -- continues to gain ground in German politics.

But, in interviews, Ms. Gessat and Ms. Glause were quick to say that their job is to reflect the world around them, and that it would be irresponsible to ignore the refugee crisis. Indeed, Ms. Glause said that conservative politicians may change their minds if they met the cast of ""Moses."" ""I would tell them to come see this show,"" she said. ""Come hear these stories.""","""Moses,"" a production by the Bavarian State Opera's youth program, brings together a cast of teenage refugees, children of immigrants and Germans.",0422ef6e-d867-53d8-8832-90c932e9bc46,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/11/arts/11MOSES4/11MOSES4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f1678c7cf14575989a1ec0e02ed9ccff9a66468f2065189e3b4420221e96186a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The director Jessica Glause, center, in a rehearsal for ""Moses,"" a work about refugees and assimilation at the Bavarian State Opera.",0422ef6e-d867-53d8-8832-90c932e9bc46,N24News/imgs/0422ef6e-d867-53d8-8832-90c932e9bc46.jpg,12

The assignment was a big break for Mankiewicz, and the writer-director Orson Welles (here played by Tom Burke) rocketed into the first rank of filmmakers with the artistry of his debut feature. As The Times raved about ""Citizen Kane"" upon its 1941 premiere: ""It comes close to being the most sensational film ever made in Hollywood."" ""Mank"" connects the dots between ""Citizen Kane"" and its inspirations in Hollywood and politics. Flashbacks retrace the brash writer's steps through studio writing rooms and parties at the media mogul William Randolph Hearst's estate. Mankiewicz was a hard-drinking transplant from New York, a former journalist and member of the Algonquin Round Table, but he moved through studio circles, trading gibes and gambling debts with writers, producers and executives. Hearst and his paramour, the starlet Marion Davies, also enjoyed Mankiewicz's sharp company, but the multimillionaire's riches and influence set wheels turning in the writer's brain, friendship be damned.

So the story goes in ""Mank,"" which also fleshes out some crucial political backdrop: a historic 1934 contest for California's governor involving the socialist writer Upton Sinclair. Here are some of the film's real-life players: Hearst (Charles Dance) parlayed a family fortune in mining into a media empire that spanned the country. By the turn of the 20th century, his popular newspapers were known for rabble-rousing, influencing world events like the Spanish-American War. Hearst also ran for office, representing New York State in Congress but losing bids for New York mayor, governor and the Democratic presidential nomination. The rise and lonely fall of Welles's Charles Foster Kane in ""Citizen Kane"" draws on tales of Hearst's vast ambitions and wealth, including his Xanadu-like estate in San Simeon, Calif. -- a pivotal location in ""Mank."" When the RKO studio sought to release ""Citizen Kane,"" Hearst (who had shifted into more conservative views) mounted a brutal campaign to stymie its wide release, aided by his proxies.

Davies (played by Amanda Seyfried) remains little known to many movie fans today and has long been considered the model for Charles Foster Kane's tone-deaf second wife in ""Citizen Kane."" In fact, Davies was a charming comedian (""Show People,"" ""The Patsy"") and vivacious social presence, but Hearst, who rabidly supported her both financially and through his news empire, stubbornly envisioned her in serious dramas. Davies opted for retirement in 1937 (at age 40) and soon enough found herself helping Hearst when his fortunes went into decline; the pair remained together until his death in 1951. Davies cheerfully bonded with Mankiewicz and was reportedly unperturbed by ""Citizen Kane."" In New York, Houseman (Sam Troughton) had put on Welles's innovative productions as part of the Federal Theater Project and then the Mercury Theater, which the two founded. Houseman edited Mankiewicz's commissions for the Mercury Theater's radio programming, and in ""Mank,"" Houseman shepherds Mankiewicz's writing of ""Citizen Kane"" in collaboration with Welles. Houseman consequently became a star witness in the decades-long tug-of-war over credit for the screenplay, which won Oscars for both Mankiewicz and Welles. After working with Welles, Houseman produced films by Nicholas Ray, Vincente Minnelli and Joseph L. Mankiewicz, Herman's brother. Later in life Houseman achieved a new fame for performing, winning his own Oscar for supporting actor for his turn as a law-school professor in the 1973 drama ""The Paper Chase,"" a role he also played on the subsequent TV series adaptation. (And, yes, he was the one in the Smith Barney ads who praised making money the old-fashioned way.)

Mayer (Arliss Howard) ruled over MGM in an era of tough-as-nails studio heads. From humble beginnings in penny arcades, Mayer helped create a golden age in Hollywood with stars like Greta Garbo and Clark Gable and classics like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Singin' in the Rain."" Mankiewicz entered the employ of MGM as a screenwriter, only to lose the gig after failing to quit gambling: Supposedly, he leaned forward to place a bet at one game, looked up, and locked eyes across the room with his soon-to-be-former boss. In ""Mank,"" the imposing MGM capo plays benevolent patriarch to his staff of thousands and throws his support behind both Hearst and Frank Merriam, the Republican candidate for governor in 1934 against Upton Sinclair. Hailing from a family of Ukrainian immigrants, Mayer would grandly claim the Fourth of July as his birthday, a detail included in ""Mank."" Hecht (Jeff Harms) wrote the screenplays for ""Notorious"" and ""Scarface"" as well as co-writing the play ""The Front Page"" (subject of several adaptations, including ""His Girl Friday""). Hecht hailed from the quick-witted New York circles once frequented by Mankiewicz, who telegrammed his friend an oft-quoted invitation to Hollywood: ""Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots."" In an ensemble scene in ""Mank,"" Hecht and Mankiewicz join a murderers' row of contract screenwriters for a conference: the Broadway comic genius George S. Kaufman, the humorist S.J. Perelman, and two Hecht collaborators, his ""Front Page"" co-writer, Charles MacArthur, and the youthful Charles Lederer, a nephew of Marion Davies. The group pitches Paramount producer David O. Selznick and ""Joe"" von Sternberg -- the director for whom Hecht wrote the pioneering gangster story ""Underworld."" Joseph Mankiewicz (Tom Pelphrey) directed ""All About Eve,"" ""The Barefoot Contessa,"" and ""Cleopatra,"" among countless other credits as a writer or producer (""The Philadelphia Story""). He also happened to be Herman's younger brother, but although Herman helped him get his start in Hollywood, it was Joseph who rose to greater and more stable fame in Hollywood's firmament. He would go on to win four Oscars, two each for directing and writing ""A Letter to Three Wives"" and ""All About Eve."" Yet the brothers Mankiewicz shared the common experience of growing up with their exacting father, Franz, a Columbia professor.

Thalberg (Ferdinand Kingsley) co-founded MGM with Louis Mayer at the astonishingly young age of 24 (after running Universal Pictures at age 20). Aptly called the ""boy wonder"" of Hollywood, he died prematurely in 1936, having overseen hundreds of movies with a respected track record for success. In ""Mank"" he's shown wielding power alongside Mayer and coldly trying to bring Mankiewicz into line with the studio's support of Merriam for governor, an effort the writer resists. Thalberg did indeed produce faked newsreels purporting to portray ordinary people who were opposed to Merriam's socialist opponent, Upton Sinclair. As Oscar fans know, the executive is commemorated by the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for excellence in production. Sinclair (Bill Nye) is well-known as the author of the meatpacking expose ""The Jungle."" (His book ""Oil!"" was freely adapted as ""There Will Be Blood."") But Sinclair also ran for governor, campaigning on his EPIC platform (End Poverty in California) with proposals including a network of cooperatives. After warm-up runs in 1926 and 1930, the best-selling writer garnered more than 800,000 votes on his next attempt, in 1934, advocating socialist policies in a state reeling from the Great Depression. He lost to Merriam, who was aided by negative campaigning partly coordinated by Mayer. ""Mank"" spotlights Sinclair giving a stump speech that catches the attention of even Mankiewicz, who for once is struck silent.","The Netflix drama about the making of ""Citizen Kane"" features characters based on Hollywood writers, studio executives and others.

Art & Design,Newseum Building to Be Sold to Johns Hopkins for $372.5 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/arts/design/newseum-sold-johns-hopkins.html,"The building that houses the Newseum -- the financially troubled monument to journalism in Washington -- is being sold to Johns Hopkins University for $372.5 million by the Freedom Forum, the foundation that created the museum. The institution will remain open through 2019 and museum executives will spend that time trying to find a new space for its contents. ""This was a difficult decision, but it was the responsible one,"" Jan Neuharth, the chairwoman and chief executive of the Freedom Forum, said in a statement released Friday. ""We remain committed to continuing our programs -- in a financially sustainable way -- to champion the five freedoms of the First Amendment and to increase public awareness about the importance of a free and fair press. With today's announcement, we can begin to explore all options to find a new home in the Washington, D.C., area."" For Johns Hopkins, the purchase will allow the university to expand and consolidate its presence in the nation's capital.

The university said in a statement that, ""anchored by the School of Advanced International Studies, Johns Hopkins' expanded presence in Washington, D.C., will increase our capacity to convene and inform decision makers, contribute to national and international policy development and forge exciting new connections to our home city of Baltimore."" It added: ""Johns Hopkins' acquisition of the building also provides financial support for the Freedom Forum's vitally important First Amendment mission."" The decision to sell came after a 16-month review that left the museum's future unclear. The Newseum has struggled financially ever since it moved from Rosslyn, Va., where it originally opened in 1997, to its opulent Pennsylvania Avenue location in 2008. It ran up deficits every year and has hundreds of millions of dollars of debt resulting from the purchase of the building. In 2017, the most recent year for which numbers are publicly available, the museum had a deficit of roughly $5 million. The Freedom Forum has been the primary backer of the Newseum, having donated $600 million over the last two decades. But its endowment has shrunk and the Freedom Forum made clear in recent years that it could not support the museum in the same way. In 2007, the Freedom Forum's endowment was approximately $550 million. In 2009, in the Newseum's first full year of operation in the new space, it dipped to below $400 million. More than a decade later, the endowment remains about the same. Opening amid a recession that hammered newsrooms across the country didn't help. Alternate revenue streams, like the $24.95 admission cost and renting out space in the building, weren't enough.

According to the Newseum, it set out to find a partner that would allow it to remain in the building, which the Freedom Forum built for $450 million. But conversations with philanthropists didn't pan out. Museum officials then tried to find a way to share the space in the seven-story building, through lease buybacks and other avenues. Ultimately, though, the museum said it found that selling the building was the only path forward. ""We stand ready to continue much of the Newseum's important work for decades to come -- through digital outreach, traveling exhibits and web-based programs in schools around the world, as well as hopefully in a new physical home in the area,"" Peter Prichard, chairman of the Newseum's board of trustees, said in a statement, hinting at what the institution's future looked like. On the same day that the museum made its announcement, BuzzFeed began the process of laying off hundreds of staffers, including several high-profile reporters. This was in addition to cuts this week at Verizon Media Group, which includes Yahoo, AOL and HuffPost, and Gannett. Last August, the Newseum faced fierce criticism from journalists after it was discovered that T-shirts reading ""You Are Very Fake News"" were being sold in the gift shop. The museum apologized and pulled the merchandise. Weeks later -- unrelated to the T-shirts -- Scott Williams, the president and chief operating officer, announced he would be leaving the museum to be closer to family in Tennessee. As for the large tablet that has the First Amendment etched on it on a facade of the building, it will likely not remain once Johns Hopkins moves in. It is considered property of the museum, not the space.","The struggling museum will have to find a new home in 2020, after years of running at a deficit.",892375a8-1fa6-5973-96f3-6e2cd3a8d526,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/arts/26newseum/26newseum-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=81919ff4813d4a6bd23b403bfe8d09c8fdc262e422a5146f6e15f1cd95e9b3e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Newseum, with the First Amendment facade.",892375a8-1fa6-5973-96f3-6e2cd3a8d526,N24News/imgs/892375a8-1fa6-5973-96f3-6e2cd3a8d526.jpg,14
Travel,Searching for a River to Skate Away On,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/travel/vermont-ice-skating-joyce-maynard.html,"Ever since I first read ""Hans Brinker, or the Silver Skates,"" I dreamed of taking off across a natural body of frozen water. Every winter of the last half century I've sought out that elusive miracle of nature: good ice. Lake or pond ice or a frozen river. The real thing. Last winter, I found it. Lake Morey -- on whose shores Vermont's Lake Morey Resort has sat since 1905 -- offers what is said to be the longest outdoor skating track (four and a half miles) in the United States. The resort is neither exotic or luxurious, and certainly not hip. But here, only a three-hour drive from my home in Connecticut, I could skate from one end of the lake clear to the other -- an experience about as far removed from skating at a rink as attending a spin class is from biking the Tour de France.

The place I headed every winter morning I had the opportunity, from the age of 7 or 8, was known as the mill pond, on the outskirts of town, with a simple wooden bench along one side where I laced up my skates in preparation for the great moment. Even now, so many decades later, that moment has lost none of its appeal: You step onto the ice -- a little gingerly at first, if it's been a while. The blades of your skates glide out over the surface, and your body follows, as if all the usual rules of gravity have been suspended. Never mind weak ankles or frostbitten toes, or the prospect of falling flat on your face. For me, skating on a pond is the closest I will ever know to flight.

The trade-off for skaters, between rink and pond ice, is obvious. The most beautiful natural places seldom offer the perfect, groomed conditions provided by a Zamboni. The ice is likely to be uneven, rough in patches, even buckled. Let's not forget the element of danger: Skating on thin ice is never a good idea, even metaphorically, but taken back to its literal meaning, should be avoided at all costs. Nearly every winter, growing up in New England, we'd hear the story of some foolhardy child -- or, now and then, an overzealous ice fisherman -- who ventured out onto a patch of ice that looked frozen solid but wasn't. For this reason most kids I knew who skated on the mill pond were not allowed on the ice until after New Year's, though even then, a freak thaw could render the place unsafe for skating.

In the marriage of my youth, my children's father and I even dug a pond next to our farmhouse, where we tried (seldom successfully) to clear the snow off ourselves. I will always hold onto a memory of a night when a lake, just down the road, was suddenly revealed to be perfectly frozen, from one end clear to the other distant shore: Black ice, as far as the eye could see. I can't remember what we did about our three young children, home in their beds, but we must have rounded up a sitter. Arm in arm, with no light but that of the moon, we took off across that lake. We were far from the shore when I heard the sound of cracking, and for a moment my heart stopped. But we were in no danger, really. What we heard was the sound ice makes -- even very thick, very solid ice -- when it expands and contracts, as it always does, especially in the coldest conditions. In my early 40s, I moved with my children to the San Francisco Bay Area -- a place untouched by below-freezing temperatures. I loved so much of life in California, but I had to hang up my skates. And for the next 20 years or so, my skating experiences were restricted to occasional visits, on trips to New York City, to Wollman Rink. I tried Radio City too, and Bryant Park. But their rinks were always so crowded. The illusion of flight, impossible. Five years ago, I was back in New England with my second husband, Jim, on the hardest kind of mission. We had flown the 3,000 miles to Boston in search of a surgeon willing to operate on Jim, in the hopes of successfully removing a tumor in his pancreas.

The weekend of our Boston trip, a small, good thing happened, in the midst of great sorrow: Word came to me from a friend back in my old hometown, not far away, that a deep chill had left the ice in perfectly glassy shape for skating. With no medical appointments until midafternoon, I hotfooted it back to New Hampshire, borrowed a pair of skates, and set out on the ice of my old mill pond. And because the Lamprey River that connects to that pond was also frozen, I skated a mile down that river, too, with a Joni Mitchell song playing in my head. ""I wish I had a river I could skate away on."" That day I did. The year after Jim died, I moved back to the East Coast. And in the face of vast loss, a small joy returned: skating. I sharpened the blades of my old skates. Renewed my quest for ice. I knew about the canals in Ottawa, of course (also Toronto). But I kept hoping to find something closer to home. This is when I discovered the Lake Morey Resort.

Situated in the town of Fairlee, Vt., just over the New Hampshire border near Dartmouth College and Hanover, Lake Morey covers an area of 545 acres. Plenty of other lakes exist in the vicinity, of course. What distinguishes this one is that the town has taken it upon itself to keep the perimeter plowed. Four and a half miles' worth of open skating trail. A person doesn't actually have to stay at the Lake Morey Resort to skate on the lake, by the way, and plenty of locals evidently do so on a regular basis. The thing about booking a weekend at the resort -- as I did, for my daughter, Audrey, and her boyfriend, Tod, and me -- is that you get to walk straight from your room out onto the ice. After a long skate, you can go into the lodge and warm up. The weekend we stayed at Lake Morey, the annual winter carnival was going on at the resort, which meant that the place was packed with young hockey players -- age 3 or 4 and up -- along with a significant contingent of hockey parents. To accommodate them all, the resort keeps a dozen or so separate spaces plowed for the games that go on throughout the day. Maybe some people -- in search of a quiet getaway -- might view the presence of so many kids bearing hockey sticks as diminishing the romance. As for me, I liked taking in the spectacle of so many very small hockey players running around in puffy coats with helmets and big sticks. They weren't going where I was, anyway: the skating trail around the edge of the lake.

When you're skating a four-and-a-half mile long trail, you don't need to worry about crowds. Nobody's coming along behind you, or hotdogging alongside. No background music, and none is needed. You might hear the wind whistling through the trees. Nothing more. I skated the loop three times that weekend. Audrey and Tod went twice as far on their fast skates. By the time we finished, the sun was going down, and the hockey players had called it a day. Only a handful of skaters remained on the ice by then, though a father and daughter remained on one of the patches of ice cleared for hockey, practicing their puck handling as the last light of day disappeared with a final flash of pink behind the mountains. Later that evening, on the drive back to the resort after dinner in town, I noted that the moon had risen -- a nearly full moon that seemed to hang directly over the frozen lake. Audrey and Tod opted for a little Ping-Pong before bed, but I knew where I was headed: back onto the ice -- empty of all skaters now; I had the whole lake to myself. I set out one more time, humming my theme song under the stars. All my life I had wished I had a river I could skate away on. That night, I discovered, a lake would do.

Real Estate,Zeus of the Catskills,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/17/realestate/zeus-of-the-catskills.html,"IT breaks Randall Wallace's heart to have to sell Glen Tonche, the 35-acre estate he owns on top of Mount Tonche in the Catskill Mountains.

The 18,000-square-foot compound can be reached only by means of a six-minute drive on a private switchback road. But the reward at the end is sweeping views of the surrounding mountains and the Ashokan Reservoir, from a place of which Mr. Wallace says, ""It's like being Zeus, high above the clouds.""

The 1928 estate was built a few miles from Woodstock by Raymond Pitcairn, an heir to the Pittsburgh Plate Glass fortune, but Mr. Wallace gave it musical renown when he built recording studios there that attracted the likes of Norah Jones, David Bowie and Natalie Merchant.

Mr. Wallace, a photographer and musician, is about to put Glen Tonche on the market for $8 million because ""it's paradise and I don't like the idea of owning paradise and not being able to live there."" He moved out to California in 2005 to share custody of his children with his ex-wife, and since then has been able to spend only a few weeks a year at his mountaintop retreat.","Randall Wallace, a photographer and musician, is about to put Glen Tonche, the 35-acre estate he owns on top of Mount Tonche in the Catskill Mountains, on the market for $8 million.",61811d68-442f-50c5-a26d-789f1527774f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/17/realestate/17EXCLUSIVE1_SPAN/17EXCLUSIVE1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=400&w=600&s=7510cfe8505743f35c72cefd857ae862bfda1fc6711790c3f1cdf2a5d20257ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,MAGIC MOUNTAIN  A 35-acre estate in the Catskills that has been used as a getaway and a recording studio is about to be listed at $8 million.,61811d68-442f-50c5-a26d-789f1527774f,N24News/imgs/61811d68-442f-50c5-a26d-789f1527774f.jpg,7
Books,When the Dinosaurs Reigned,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/29/books/review/steve-brusatte-dinosaurs-rise-and-fall.html,"THE RISE AND FALL OF THE DINOSAURS 

A New History of a Lost World

By Steve Brusatte 

Illustrated. 404 pp. William Morrow/HarperCollins Publishers. $29.99. If the idea that Morocco once butted up against New York strikes you as just ho-hum; if your mind doesn't boggle that 10,000 species of dinosaurs still exist; and if you're not impressed that Tyrannosaurus rex was strong enough to bite through a car -- then this book is not for you. But if John McPhee's love affair with rocks in ""Annals of the Former World"" floats your boat, and so does Janna Levin's entertaining narrative in ""Black Hole Blues and Other Songs From Outer Space,"" you're going to love ""The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs,"" by the paleontologist Steve Brusatte.

Brusatte skillfully brings dead dino bones to life as he shares -- no, gushes about -- his personal journey as a young fossil hunter and the people he's met along the way. It's an ""I can't wait to tell you, listen to this!"" page turner, dropping one aha moment after another. ""Somewhere around the world,"" he writes, ""a new species of dinosaur is currently being found, on average, once a week. Let that sink in: a new dinosaur every ... single ... week."" Poof. Mind blown. You think he enjoys what he does?

The geek in me loves the tsunami of fine details flooding the page, written in the breezy style of a rising star millennial scientist. Brusatte systematically takes us through the various stages of dinosaur evolution, starting with the pre-dino Triassic Period, when a mass extinction cleared the path for their rise. Dinosaurs could not have flourished without these dramatic events that reshaped the earth just over 250 million years ago -- lava spewing from countless erupting volcanoes, smothering life wherever it flowed, greenhouse gases blanketing the planet, heating the ancient ocean and triggering a sweltering global warming that helped wipe out most living land animals. Yet the head-scratcher remains: Why did early dinosaurs survive the hell of the Triassic extinction, leaving them -- free of competitors -- to multiply and dominate? ""I wish I had a good answer,"" Brusatte confesses. ""It's a mystery that quite literally has kept me up at night. ... Maybe dinosaurs were just lucky.""

The author can't be blamed for devoting a whole chapter to the king of the dinosaurs: T. Rex. The perfect ""killing machine"" has been a fan favorite in movies dating back to the classic ""King Kong,"" after all, achieving its greatest role in Steven Spielberg's ""Jurassic Park"" -- the film that changed the author's life. ""So many scientists are impulsively drawn to the majesty that is the King, the way so many people are obsessed with movie stars and athletes,"" Brusatte writes. He offers plenty of meat about Rex to chew on, especially the way it chewed: its bite terrifyingly unique among all dino carnivores. ""Rex bit deeply into its victim, often right through the bones, and then ripped back."" As befitting a king, T. Rex's technique has been given its own name: ""puncture-pull feeding."" Yet missing from most movies is the evolving picture of Rex as an ancestor of birds, with feathers sticking out between its scales to keep it warm, and perhaps doubling as a mating display. And Rex was no dummy. Measurements of the brain cavity show ""Rex was roughly as smart as a chimp and more intelligent than dogs and cats."" And while dinosaurs did roam the entire length of the planet, North America was Rex's sole domain. Its teeth lie buried all over the continent. The often discussed dino demise 66 million years ago obscures their 150-million-year reign, making them among the most successful creatures ever to walk the planet. ""Far from being failures,"" Brusatte writes, ""they were evolutionary success stories."" Their fossilized remains can be found just about everywhere on earth. And while we talk about the fall of the dinosaurs, tens of thousands of species of dinosaurs are still among us. We call them birds. You may not believe it, the author says, but ""birds are just a weird group of dinosaurs"" that evolved wings and learned to fly. ""The realization that birds are dinosaurs is probably the single most important fact ever discovered by dinosaur paleontologists.""

Young scientists like Brusatte and his buddies share a palpable sense of wonder. ""I get the creeps when looking at the earliest Triassic tracks. I can sense the long-distant specter of death."" This emotional connection, and Brusatte's collection of personal stories and characters, make his book special. There's the tale of Georgia O'Keeffe's Ghost Ranch, ""bursting with dinosaur bones,"" becoming a mecca for young paleontologists who flocked there after her death. Chances are, says Brusatte, ""if you go see a big dinosaur exhibit today you'll see a Ghost Ranch Coelophysis,"" the ""quintessential Triassic dinosaur."" We also meet Baron Fronz Nopcsa von Felso-Szilvas, the flamboyant ""tragic genius"" spy whose World War I fossil-hunting adventures in Transylvania would end in the murder-suicide of him and his lover. ""Dracula,"" Brusatte writes, ""has nothing on the Dinosaur Baron."" And there's the incomparable Barnum Brown, who in 1902 would discover the first T. Rex and go on to become ""the first celebrity paleontologist"" -- if alive today he ""would be the star of some outrageous reality show. And probably a politician."" Paleontology has plenty of personalities, and Brusatte pulls no punches describing their political and racial baggage. You'll get to know Henry Fairfield Osborn, president of the prestigious American Museum of Natural History, who, because of his views on white supremacy, immigration and eugenics, is ""often dismissed today as a bygone bigot."" Osborn, Brusatte notes, was ""probably not the type of guy I'd want to have a beer with."" But his science was spot on. Like Woody Allen's Zelig, Brusatte is always at the right place at the right time. At Hell Creek, Mont., for the discovery of a ""Triceratops graveyard,"" startling evidence that Triceratops was a pack species. Hanging with his mentor Mark Norell in his fabled Central Park office at the American Museum. In China, drooling over the collection of feather-covered fossils curated by the ""world's greatest dinosaur hunter,"" China's Xu Xing, just a stone's throw from the ""paleontologista"" Jingmai O'Connor and her ""leopard print Lycra, piercings and tattoos."" We marvel at the talented biologist Jacob Vinther, whose microscope found the color in dinosaur feathers that allowed them -- like peacocks -- to become better at flirting. (Only by accident, typical of evolution, did they learn to fly.) As an awe-struck fanboy Brusatte makes a pilgrimage to Italy to watch the iconic Walter Alvarez show off his historic discovery: a thin layer of clay in an obscure gorge, the long-sought remains of a disintegrated asteroid, and the first solid evidence for the idea that a cataclysmic impact wiped out the dinosaurs. The physicist Richard Feynman marveled at how nature's beauty is hidden in her details. He could find extra enjoyment in the beauty of a flower because he also understood the inner workings of the plant.

Music,4 Musicians Chart 100 Years in the Life of a Runaway Slave,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/arts/music/julia-bullock-henze-cimarron.html,"The bass-baritone Davone Tines rehearsing Hans Werner Henze's ""El Cimarron"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Directed by Zack Winokur, it's the finale of the soprano Julia Bullock's season-long Met residency.

Esteban Montejo was over 100 before the world knew his story. Born a slave in Cuba in 1860, he escaped and lived for years in the jungle until slavery was abolished on the island in 1886. He fought in Cuba's war for independence from Spain and lived through Castro's communist revolution. His interviews with an ethnographer were adapted into a riveting account of his life, published in 1966. The German composer Hans Werner Henze read the book, visited Cuba, met Montejo -- who lived until 1973 -- and, with the writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger, swiftly created ""El Cimarron,"" which will be performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art on Friday and Saturday. A 75-minute ""recital for four musicians"" -- baritone, guitarist, flutist and percussionist (who presides over dozens of instruments) -- it tells Montejo's story through music that's vivid, seductive and otherworldly, sometimes forceful, sometimes delicate, the vocal line floating between musical pitches and speech.

Ms. Bullock, though, will be offstage. ""In these early days of figuring out how to curate,"" she said in an interview, ""it's easier to visualize things with my direct involvement. But I was so glad to let the bookend of this be in somebody else's hands."" After developing the production last summer with the American Modern Opera Company, Ms. Bullock, Mr. Winokur and Mr. Tines sat down in the midst of the final rehearsals to discuss it. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

DAVONE TINES We see what the foundation of this person was, the heft and thickness of his life experience. We experience his genesis and a bit of his growth. All of that is very closely narrated. But we've also been talking about the prism of memory, and later in life his mental faculties disperse or go to a different place. WINOKUR He talks about slavery with a very dynamic and forceful musical language. Then he escapes into the woods and there are these extended beautiful sections when he's just figuring out how to navigate, roping piglets, making fires, listening to the trees, eating honey and finding herbs and different flowers and just sort of sleeping and listening to the birds. JULIA BULLOCK The real sense of freedom he felt for the first time. TINES And you feel that musically, as well. You go from the stringent, forceful music of slavery to this really open, impressionistic music of the forest.

WINOKUR He talks about how much he just loved the peace and quiet, even though there were moments of extreme anxiety. And you see his interaction when he hears about the end of slavery, which he does not believe could be real. He encounters a woman with two children who tells him yes, we're really free. And he decides to go back and then when he re-enters and becomes a waged worker, you see his impression of progress; there's a section called ""Machines,"" just looking at the production of sugar cane, and it's completely mind-blowing to him. BULLOCK Mind-blowing because so many things had been based on rudimentary human labor. But with the ending of slavery, people were still essentially enslaved. The capacity of their lives was still cemented.

WINOKUR There's almost no space when he's talking about slavery. It's incredibly rhythmical; there's no space between sections. TINES Or between words in sentences. WINOKUR And when he goes into the woods, there are extensive, like, seven minutes of listening to the birds and walking. TINES And then we get back to ""Machines,"" and it's even more mechanized. As if nothing has been solved. That must have appealed to Henze, a passionate leftist, on a political level. That slavery and what followed were just different iterations of unequal power. TINES The machines are just stronger and louder.

WINOKUR Part One is in a straight order, as described in the book. In Part Two, the libretto took a little more of a turn, and we sort of get Montejo's thoughts on things. Like about women, and how much he missed them, and there's a little moment of attempted bestiality with a horse in the woods. About the priests and then about the Americans when they come, and how disgusting they are. And then we end where he ended, when he was doing the interviews at 103, and the importance of friendliness and being with people. BULLOCK Also taking up arms for oneself. WINOKUR A really thrilling part of the show is the Battle of Mal Tiempo, which is where we watch him cut off the heads of colonizing Spaniards.

BULLOCK At the end of the biography and the end of the piece Henze wrote, the sense is that moving into the future, ""I've got my machete."" WINOKUR ""I'll be there for all the battles that are coming."" WINOKUR The music is held together in all these thin and beautiful ways. It's very fragile. There's the militant idea, captured in the gigantic battery of percussion. There are Cuban styles mixed with Spanish styles and American styles for different moments. We get this ""Oh! Susanna"" on the melodica during the whole ""Yankees"" bit, which is one of the strangest colors in the show.

Just this morning I was thinking about toward the end of the piece when things sort of taper down. It's interesting to play within a smaller range and not have to be [singing a wild parody of modernist music] ""I have to be so cra-zy."" WINOKUR It should be a range that feels like speech -- heightened speech, but speech. A lot of recordings feel very formal, and that doesn't seem like that was Henze's intention. I wanted to get it back to its origin as a ""recital for four musicians,"" and a real chamber piece. Not only did I want the musicians to be implicated in the action and become characters in the piece, using their musical material, but I also wanted it to have the attention on each other that's necessary in chamber music. BULLOCK That's one reason I wanted to program this. Oftentimes when Henze is performed, people are wanting to show it is alternative. But I think Henze was trying to create a very human expression.","To conclude her residency at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Julia Bullock is presenting Hans Werner Henze's ""El Cimarrón.""",b6a12d05-d2fd-5a80-8cdc-b846c6dedbe6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/09/arts/09museum-music7/09museum-music7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=380a3c158b15537f50fda7f4aa85de213d485859289586f15ae6108c15e3e5b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The bass-baritone Davóne Tines rehearsing Hans Werner Henze's ""El Cimarrón"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Real Estate,Readers Respond to 'Life After Brooklyn',https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/26/realestate/readers-respond-to-life-after-brooklyn.html,"Brooklyn - love it or leave it. That was the sentiment expressed by readers in reaction to an Aug. 22 article, ""Life After Brooklyn,"" about people who are moving out of Brooklyn because of rising real estate prices, which attracted more than 600 comments. For starters, there was a lot of venting about hipster displacement and gentrification. A reader by the screen name Sleater, for example, sounded off with this post: ""And the cycle of gentrification and hypergentrification continues! Push the longtime residents out, look for 'people like us,' raise rents and mortgages through the roof, and just move on to the next spot. PLEASE, stop it!"" Though another, Teri, who bought in Brooklyn nearly two decades ago, egged the hipsters on: ""I live in Brooklyn and what keeps me here is that I bought a house in a neighborhood that no one wanted to live in in 1995. It is now a 'desirable' place and I have made a fortune on my investment, I laugh all the way to the bank as all of the 'gentrifiers' pay millions, keep it up please!"" Plenty of people waxed nostalgic for an older Brooklyn, with lower rents, ""the best pizza and Italian ices"" as opposed to ""wine bars and hipster clothing stores,"" as ""greenie,"" who grew up in Brooklyn, put it: ""My Brooklyn was in truth kinda gritty at times, but it was home for the working and lower-middle classes.""

Of growing up in the 1950s and '60s, Allen Roth wrote: ""Bklyn was utterly different from its status now as a Manhattan-manque. Brooklyn was, more than anything else, a state of mind. A place of delicatessens, salumerias, bodegas, and the type of person who would never have been caught living in Manhattan (and not because it was more expensive), just as the Manhattanite of yesteryear would never even have thought of living in Bklyn."" But it wasn't all charming, as a reader by the screen name jrak pointed out: ""I've lived in Brooklyn for more than 60 years and recall the days when car break-ins, bike thefts and burglaries were quite common and areas like Fort Greene Park were havens for drug dealers and muggers. While many of my friends and relatives left for the greener and safer pastures of the suburbs, I stayed because I enjoy living in a neighborhood where I can walk to great shops, restaurants, and parks and where everything the city has to offer is only a subway ride away. I've been to all the major cities in this country and none come close to breadth of what New York City has to offer and its vitality. Because of that, Brooklyn will continue to attract young graduates seeking to start their careers along with immigrants and refugees seeking a better life. Yes, it's not easy to make it here, but probably no more now than it was in centuries past. I'm glad to have seen its renaissance in my lifetime.""

Some readers expressed regret over not holding onto property in areas where real estate has skyrocketed. ""My family sold our grandparents' house on President in the 1990s for something like $390,000,"" posted John Frank: ""I had begged them to hold on but they were thrilled to get that, remembering the days in the '60s when block-busting real estate types were offering people $10,000 cash for those brownstones as fears that the neighborhood was changing pushed people to flee."" Plenty of people who moved to the borough expressed frustration with a growing income divide. PG wrote: ""In my Brooklyn tenure I lived in Greenpoint, Williamsburg, Prospect Heights, and then Crown Heights. I got priced out of each neighborhood one by one. Rich kids whose parents paid the rent, yuppies, and finance types kept moving in. That changes the climate of a neighborhood. The middle class won't be able to live here much longer, and that's a shame.""

Others, like Phil, who moved to Brooklyn 25 years ago, viewed the changes as purely cyclical: ""I totally understand the challenge face by the people in the article, but it's the classic NYC real estate story: area is neglected; area is slowly altered by artists and young, resourceful people; area is re-discovered, first by educators, non-profit employees, and young families; corporate interests take over and price out the creative types who were the pioneers of the area's rebirth."" People outside of Brooklyn said they could relate, including this reader, who said: ""Oakland has increased in popularity due to its bohemian culture, art, and diversity,"" wrote one reader. The exorbitant cost of living in San Francisco and Oakland's newfound status is attracting hoards of new money. Consequently, 'the town' is growing out of reach for the average working class family, which is slowly changing the face and feel of Oakland. It is not the same city I moved to 12 years ago."" Moving out of Brooklyn was rewarding but bittersweet for a reader by the screenname of ""ImissBrooklyn"" who left for Charleston, S.C., after 12 years in the borough after rent became too expensive and the commute too long: ""I miss Brooklyn terribly, but am also glad I was forced to make the tough choice because I am better off now. My money goes farther, I live near the beach and am in the process of buying a house. Buying would never be an option for me in Brooklyn."" It's clear from the comments that Brooklyn has changed dramatically but strong sentiments about the borough remain, as this post from millie demonstrates: ""All I can say is 'The more things change, the more they stay the same.' My dad was born on Havemeyer Street in 1925 when it was filled with Italian immigrants. He left with us in the late '50s to raise his children on Long Island (when Long Island was still lovely and had farms, even in Nassau County), though we still visited my grandmother, aunts, uncles, cousins every Sunday back in the city. We were considered the, quote unquote, lucky ones to be able to afford such living conditions out east! Now, only two generations later, my 23-year old daughter, home from college, is back with me in my Westside apartment unable to afford an apartment on Havemeyer Street (which she would love to have) even if she had to share it with five other kids. I'll bet you my beautiful father, who lived on that block in a tenement house with his entire family (parents, siblings, aunts, uncles, cousins) during the Great Depression is (not rolling, but) smiling in his grave. He always thought, even after we left, Brooklyn was the greatest. I love you, dad.

Media,"Toni Grant, Psychotherapist, Dies at 73; Her Couch Was on AM Radio",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/09/business/media/toni-grant-therapist-of-the-airwaves-dies-at-73.html,"Toni Grant, one of the first nationally renowned radio psychologists, whose advice on relations between the sexes was celebrated as refreshingly traditional in some quarters and castigated as appallingly pre-feminist in others, died on March 27 in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 73.

The cause was complications of dementia, her daughter Courtney Raspin said.

A clinical psychologist, Dr. Grant was known for her soothing, honeyed voice; her pragmatic approach to listeners' questions about a cornucopia of delicate subjects -- marriage, divorce, sex, dating, cross-dressing, child rearing -- and advice that, while it pulled no punches, was far less bellicose than that of some psychologists who followed her onto the airwaves.

She was first given her own show on KABC-AM in Los Angeles in 1975. The show, which later moved to KFI-AM there, was syndicated nationally in the early 1980s. Eventually heard on more than 180 stations, it became one of the first psychological call-in shows to reach a wide listenership.

Dr. Grant, who described her show as ""a soap opera that educates,"" remained on the air until 1990. After a hiatus, she returned to the radio from 1997 to 2001.","Dr. Grant, who described her show as ""a soap opera that educates,"" was on the air for almost 20 years.",0b04043d-409e-5140-811e-828e56f189b8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/09/arts/09GrantObit/09GrantObit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a466eba96012778298da95bc594f6c79b2477f1edeb3600f362f17ca5580eb28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The radio psychologist Toni Grant with Frank Sinatra Jr. in 1981 at a charity auction in Beverly Hills, Calif.",0b04043d-409e-5140-811e-828e56f189b8,N24News/imgs/0b04043d-409e-5140-811e-828e56f189b8.jpg,16
Music,"Bard College Music Student Sues School, Citing Instructor's Conduct",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/21/arts/music/bard-college-music-student-sues.html,"Avalon Packer, a student at Bard College, is suing the school where a teacher was found to have sexually harassed her.





A music instructor at Bard College was fired this year after a Title IX investigation determined he had sexually harassed a young percussion student. Now, the student is asserting in a lawsuit against the college that the instructor should not have been on staff because of prior harassment complaints that the school knew about. In the federal suit filed on Tuesday in Manhattan, Avalon Packer, 21, a percussionist who started at Bard in 2016, accuses Carlos Valdez, the percussion teacher, of rubbing up against her while he had an erection during a lesson, and later forcibly kissing her. Though Mr. Valdez was fired this year after an investigation found Ms. Packer's account credible, her lawsuit says that she learned while reviewing the investigator's notes from her case that Mr. Valdez had been the subject of two other complaints under Title IX, a federal law that bars sexual discrimination in institutions that receive federal funds. The lawsuit says that the previous complaints were also substantiated by an investigation, which recommended that Mr. Valdez be terminated. But instead, it says, the college allowed him to continue teaching after making a written apology and taking an online anti-harassment course.

""They obviously protected somebody who didn't deserve protection, when in fact their whole commitment is to protect students,"" Ms. Packer said in an interview. In a statement on Wednesday, the college disputed Ms. Packer's recounting of the prior case, saying Mr. Valdez, a part-time instructor, had been terminated at the conclusion of the earlier investigation but was reinstated on appeal after agreeing to abide by a variety of conditions. ""Bard College takes all complaints of sexual misconduct with the utmost gravity,"" the statement said. Mr. Valdez, 66, who had disputed Ms. Packer's account, did not respond to messages via phone or email. He is not named as a party to the lawsuit. The suit names Bard's president, Leon Botstein, a music scholar and conductor who has run the school for 45 years, as one of the defendants. Ms. Packer, who was raised in Alaska, said she took up percussion as a child and later attended the Manhattan School of Music. ""My goal with going to Bard College, I wanted to really be able to study all types of percussion,"" she said.

Even before she began her freshman year in 2016, she said in her lawsuit, Mr. Valdez messaged her from his personal Facebook page, gave her his phone number and invited her for a private tour of the campus, in Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. He said that he had watched clips of her performing, she said in the lawsuit. Ms. Packer was flattered and excited. ""In the beginning, he always told me I was very talented and better than everybody else at percussion,"" she said in an interview. But within months, Mr. Valdez began showing her unwanted attention, Ms. Packer said in the suit, including massaging her back as she played, saying he was fixing her posture. He also regularly pressed himself against her back, she said, including once in the fall of 2016 when she could feel his erection.

In February 2017, she says in her lawsuit, Mr. Valdez suddenly grabbed and kissed her without her consent. From then on, she said in the suit, she stopped going to private lessons with him, saying she had an injury. Not long afterward, the lawsuit says, she ran into him on campus and he warned her against making a Title IX complaint because ""he always wins.""

Ms. Packer said in an interview that after the last incident she withdrew, socially and scholastically, her grades dropped and she grew depressed. ""The amount of anxiety I was carrying, I wasn't even able to perform,"" she said. In 2019, she described her experiences to a faculty member at the school who helped direct her toward a Title IX complaint, she said in the interview. The investigator found that Mr. Valdez had violated the school's Gender-Based Misconduct Policy and created a hostile environment for Ms. Packer, according to a letter from Malia K. Du Mont, Bard's chief of staff and vice president for strategy and policy, that was filed as part of the case. The letter acknowledges that some of Mr. Valdez's colleagues and students told the investigator that they had seen the instructor hug and massage students without their consent and that the instructor had not changed his behavior ""despite previous warnings."" When Ms. Packer was permitted to look through summaries from the investigator, her suit says, she learned that Mr. Valdez had been the subject of two other Title IX cases, including one from the 2014-2015 school year in which a student was also ""hugged, grabbed, and kissed"" without her consent. The school said in its statement that Mr. Valdez was fired as a result of the earlier investigation but reinstated on appeal about a month later, after agreeing ""to adhere to remedial measures to address his conduct, including counseling and training."" ""The College administration,"" the statement said, ""also made unannounced visits to his class sessions and tutorials to monitor his actions.""","The teacher was fired, but the suit says he should not have been on staff because of prior complaints by other students.",f45fad40-9398-53c0-8c0b-011941b526c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/21/arts/21bard4/21bard4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e5927e285fec977633cdd60eff744f8b0f078b3afe056f9245496993dc6c9047&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bard College, in Annadale-on-Hudson, N.Y., said it would fight the suit, asserting it had acted appropriately in response to complaints by students about the instructor, Carlos Valdez.",f45fad40-9398-53c0-8c0b-011941b526c3,N24News/imgs/f45fad40-9398-53c0-8c0b-011941b526c3.jpg,12
Music,"The Playlist: Christina Aguilera's Bizarre Puzzle, and 13 More New Songs",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/music/playlist-christina-aguilera-kanye-west-travis-scott-dirty-projectors.html,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week's most notable new songs and videos -- and anything else that strikes them as intriguing. This week, Kanye West contributes an honest verse to Travis Scott, Dirty Projectors' David Longstreth leaves his breakup music behind and 14-year-old Joey Alexander debuts new original tunes. Just want the music? Listen to the Playlist on Spotify here (or find our profile: nytimes). Like what you hear? Let us know at theplaylist@nytimes.com and sign up for our Louder newsletter, a once-a-week blast of our pop music coverage.

What is happening here? Christina Aguilera, possessor of one of the great voices of the 2000s, has been mostly silent the last five years. And with her new single ""Accelerate"" -- from the forthcoming album ""Liberation,"" due in June -- she's something not far from silent, one small piece in a fantastically weird puzzle. ""Accelerate,"" produced by Kanye West, Che Pope and Mike Dean, sounds like it's built from spare parts: Ty Dolla Sign's moans and yelps, sinuous keyboard lines, a charmingly staccato verse from 2 Chainz. Somewhere in there is Ms. Aguilera, under-singing and trying not to get pushed into a corner. And yet despite these disparate inputs, there's something loose and admirable happening here: Everyone is trying new things, and the disarray verges on flamboyance. JON CARAMANICA

The 14-year-old virtuoso Joey Alexander is already on his fourth solo album, and ""Eclipse,"" out Friday, is his most engrossing yet. Recorded on the day of the solar eclipse in 2017, it finds the pianist sounding uninhibited, letting some sweat fly. As always, his harmonies are a great marvel, and these pieces tend to have an exuberant bounce -- carried off with the bassist Reuben Rogers and the drummer Eric Harland -- somewhere between swing rhythm, calypso and Javanese propulsion. Six of ""Eclipse's"" 11 tracks are originals; ""Fourteen"" is a highlight with an appearance by the eminent tenor saxophonist Joshua Redman. An intensely responsive soloist, he maneuvers with assurance as Mr. Alexander dances about him, bright chords and buzzing inflections laying fresh bait at every turn. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

After a rather draining few weeks in the public life of Kanye West comes this vivid verse, on a new Travis Scott song (produced by Pi'erre Bourne) with a cuddly Lil Uzi Vert chorus. Mr. West lets down the veil a bit, giving chum to voyeurs while also taking them to task: Wanna know how I feel? Step into my minefield?

Wanna know how pain feels? I got off my main pills

Bet my wifey stay close, she know I'm on my Bezos

Opioid addiction, pharmacy's the real trap

Sometimes I feel trapped, Jordan with no Phil Jack

One year it's Illuminati, next year it's the Sunken Place

Joe Casey, the vocalist and lyricist of the post-punk band Protomartyr, posits capitalism as a grim reaper in ""Wheel of Fortune,"" from the band's coming EP. ""I decide who lives and who dies,"" he growls, with backup vocals from Kelley Deal of the Breeders turning it into a melody. The song is a suite of three disparate sections -- two carrying lyrics, one wordless with a spooky high vocal, each section a crescendo of increasing density and dissonance. As the pressure rises, Mr. Casey observes things like ""A man with a gun and a deluded sense of purpose/A good guy with a gun who missed/A police state desperate to reach quota."" No happy endings here. J.P.

Blissfully dim dance music for a summer on the beach and in the club (which is also on the beach). This song cements Balenciaga's primacy in the popular fashion imagination -- ""Do you ever think about me? But you Balenciaga and Prada/that bougie kind of love ain't cheap"" -- while also portending its doom following what may well be months of runway-themed fist pumps. J.C.

The cornetist, multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Ben LaMar Gay has been recording music for a while -- he just hasn't been releasing it. ""Downtown Castles Can Never Block the Sun,"" his first official album, pulls from seven different discs he's created over the past few years and passed around to family and friends. Based in both Chicago and Brazil, Mr. Gay is an artist with great conviction but no use for stability -- or perhaps no trust in it. Herein lies dark soundscaping, tropicalia on tenterhooks, broken beat, Tuareg melodies, Bahia drumming. On the low, staticky murmur of ""Uvas,"" the sonic walls close in tight around you: You might hear it as claustrophobia, or comfort. G.R.

Even a superb singer needs songs. Leon Bridges, the Texas-based singer and songwriter whose voice harks back to both the suave tenderness and the churchy grit of Sam Cooke, is still underserved by his material on his major-label debut album, ""Good Thing,"" although he is now collaborating with song doctors like Justin Tranter and Ricky Reed. But ""Mrs.,"" a bluesy throwback to Southern soul tucked near the end of the album, approaches his potential. It's about a combative but still amorous marriage -- ""I remember how it felt the first few times/Skin to skin before you knew how to get under mine"" -- and Mr. Bridges captures every bit of the ambivalent longing.

As for the photo, it was from June 2019 and shows the actor Cuba Gooding Jr. after he surrendered to police in New York and was charged with sexual abuse and forcible touching after a woman accused him of groping her at a rooftop bar.

The rumors surrounding Mr. Jones stem from a court case initiated by Republicans in September that sought to block the extension of time for mail-in and early voting in Harris County. The Texas Supreme Court rejected the Republican request in October.

The court filings included accusations of an illegal ""ballot harvesting operation"" in Harris County, where volunteers and other workers were gathering absentee and mail-in ballots and delivering them to ballot collection sites. Citing inquiries conducted by private investigators, the filings claimed that the ""harvesters"" were taking the ballots of homeless people and nursing home residents, forging signatures and picking candidates of their own choosing.","The staff member denied that he was arrested, and a photo purportedly showing his arrest was actually that of the actor Cuba Gooding Jr.",4c9c747d-d1a5-5ceb-8695-399407bc4315,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/us/politics/17distortions-brief-biden/17distortions-brief-biden-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c0749eb6844a5bb165d52228a05ce3019d7c65d39f9bb565d51e06526d0d8cd8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Supporters of Joe Biden celebrated in downtown Austin on Nov. 7 hours after it was announced that he had won the presidency.,4c9c747d-d1a5-5ceb-8695-399407bc4315,N24News/imgs/4c9c747d-d1a5-5ceb-8695-399407bc4315.jpg,20
Food,"Peak, With 101st-Floor Views, Opens in Hudson Yards",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/dining/nyc-restaurant-openings.html,"At the pinnacle of 30 Hudson Yards, the tallest tower in the complex, will be this sleek restaurant with stunning views from the 101st floor. The architect David Rockwell's company, the Rockwell Group, has given the space a richly elegant but subdued look with shades of gray as the dominant palette. The Peak experience involves entering through a dim, plush lounge for cocktails and bar snacks on the fifth floor of Hudson Yards's retail building. From there, an elevator speeds up and docks at a spacious lobby, with the restaurant to one side and private dining rooms and an event space opposite. The restaurant dips gradually from a curved, brass-trimmed 45-seat bar area to a 110-seat dining room, where sculptural light sticks hang from the ceiling and bare tables on a few levels afford views like a bird's-eye of the Empire State Building. Does it remind you of Windows on the World? Of course, but with less grandeur and gilt. The restaurant is run by RHC, the English company that also manages Wild Ink in Hudson Yards. The executive chef, Christopher Cryer, who was in that role at the Seamore's seafood restaurants, has created a fairly brief menu of sophisticated yet accessible American fare like Atlantic scallops with cauliflower puree, beef tartare, rigatoni with lamb sausages, roasted monkfish with littleneck clams, cauliflower steak, braised short rib, rotisserie chicken and a fried potato terrine. Local ingredients dominate. (Opens March 12)

Prime waterfront real estate with the Manhattan skyline in full view distinguishes this restaurant at the edge of Gantry Plaza State Park in Long Island City, Queens. And, with 170 seats inside and another 84 outdoors, it's primed for all seasons. Aptly described as an American brasserie, American Brass puts ample windows, brass and antique mirrors on display. The menu also leans brasserie, featuring both clam chowder and French onion soup, assorted mussel preparations, Caesar salad, a charcuterie board, steak tartare, barbecue ribs, rotisserie chicken, roasted black sea bass, cauliflower ""steak"" and the inevitable burger. The chef, Raffaele Solinas, is also in charge of the kitchen at Maiella, this restaurant's sibling. Both restaurants are owned by Tommy Demaras and Robert Briskin. (Wednesday)

Matt Le-Khac, who was at the Finch and Blue Hill at Stone Barns, is celebrating his Vietnamese heritage in the open kitchen of his trim Williamsburg, Brooklyn, restaurant. Jimmy Tran, a Vietnamese-American from Houston who worked at Benu in San Francisco, is his right hand in the kitchen. They are serving steamed glass dumplings packed with mushrooms; ground Wagyu beef wrapped in betel leaf; poached chicken with Vietnamese coriander and cured eggs; and a typical Mekong Delta specialty, whole fried fish (he uses local blackfish), but in a Red Boat vinaigrette. Many of the herbs and vegetables come from his farm. Soon the restaurant's backyard will yield small crops and provide room for sipping tea. The name of the restaurant comes from a dance that was popular in Saigon in the 1950s.

A 10-seat omakase sushi bar (with tastings at $165 and $195) and a Japanese-style cocktail bar featuring drinks made with Japanese whiskeys, gins, vodkas and ingredients like shiso share the intimate speakeasy-style space in the Canal Arcade in Manhattan's Chinatown. Stone and charred wood highlight the decor. Sushi a la carte and other small plates can be ordered at the bar.","An American brasserie in Long Island City, Vietnamese in Williamsburg, and more restaurant news.",13fa0cc6-8f14-5b91-835e-9724522bd8d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/04/dining/03OFF/merlin_169727583_813b3390-3856-451b-aaae-7c9712dac492-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0a024ccb234c4f65e1ba7e13f2a9f5a4960415e38eeff1a6172d6611791ab6d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The chef Christopher Cryer, and the view from Peak.",13fa0cc6-8f14-5b91-835e-9724522bd8d1,N24News/imgs/13fa0cc6-8f14-5b91-835e-9724522bd8d1.jpg,17
Books,"Visions of New Worlds, Both Hopeful and Nightmarish",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/books/review/welcome-to-the-new-world-jake-halpern-bad-island-stanley-donwood-mindviscosity-matt-furie.html,"In January 2017 a comic strip series written by the journalist Jake Halpern and illustrated by Michael Sloan debuted in this newspaper. It ran until October of that year, and won its creators the 2018 Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning. ""Welcome to the New World"" is a reported work that follows a family of Syrian refugees who arrive in America on the eve of Donald Trump's election. This real-life story is remarkable for many reasons, including the groundbreaking context of its publication: It appeared week after week in the Sunday Review under the rubric of Opinion. Its status there as a regular feature, sharing real estate with prose pieces, offered a striking and unusual showcase. The series has now been adapted and developed for WELCOME TO THE NEW WORLD (Metropolitan/Holt, $21.99), an engaging narrative between covers that offers an even more intimate look at the Aldabaan family's struggles, both personal and bureaucratic, to make their lives work in America. When the series appeared in the newspaper, Halpern decided to obscure the family's location and real names because of a terrifying death threat that brought the F.B.I. to their home. Here, the actual names and city are specified, and we spend months following Ibrahim and Adeebah and their five children as they try to settle in and around New Haven, Conn. Ibrahim eventually finds work at a Friendly's and his teenage son, Naji, at a Dunkin' Donuts. ""Welcome to the New World"" treats Naji -- sensitive, charismatic and complicated -- with the most care and attention, presenting a truly multifaceted character; it reveals, more than halfway through, a moving back story that takes place in Homs, Syria, in 2011, which explains his often remarked upon maturity. The narrative succeeds in part because of its slow reveal; readers connect with the family members as personalities before we begin to see the miseries of their past.

Sloan and Halpern deliver a story that fully inhabits its comics form, and breathes with an easy visual elegance. They deploy the thought balloon, a standard comics device, with unusual efficacy, using it to create free-floating narration that uncovers multiple points of view throughout, including from peripheral characters. The balloon presents the intrafamilial tensions and reveals the mind-set of the Aldabaans in their interactions with Americans. For the latter, we often witness a useful split perspective, revealing, for instance, how nervous their volunteer sponsors (from Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services) also are. One laugh-out-loud episode centers on a volunteer escort's chagrin after she asks Naji to change into a dress-code regulation collared shirt for his first day of public school, only to discover that it is ""Pajama Day."" (Naji himself is amused.)

Sloan, an accomplished illustrator who also creates his own comics, organizes simple but powerful layouts to emphasize emotion, and his loose, fluid black line, minimal but energetic, lives on pages colored exclusively with blue. As in celebrated graphic narratives like Alison Bechdel's ""Fun Home,"" the book uses one color, an effect that stylizes and distills the images. The ""world"" of the title, which evokes the famous ending of ""The Great Gatsby"" (where immigrant Dutch sailors spy the ""fresh, green breast of the new world""), refers not only to a new social environment and a new way of life, but also to the devastated state of contemporary affairs that produces the flight of refugees globally. And it refers, of course, to the new world ushered in by the rise of Donald Trump. ""Excuse me,"" Ibrahim asks Lara, an American volunteer, on Nov. 8, 2016, their first night in the country. ""What happens if he wins?"" The precarity of the world is the subject of the English artist Stanley Donwood's BAD ISLAND (Norton, $18), which explores an unnamed island over millenniums, from a primeval time of megafauna to industry, war and nuclear disaster. ""Bad Island"" joins a rich tradition of socially conscious (and often socialist) ""wordless novels,"" executed in woodcut and printed in black and white, which bloomed in the 1920s and '30s and were made famous by artists such as Lynd Ward; Donwood, known for his distinctive album art collaborations with Radiohead, works in linocut. Here we see civilization emerge and destroy itself. And in this moment, ""Bad Island"" feels more prophecy than fable.

But it is to Donwood's credit that he makes the actual reading experience of ""Bad Island"" a pleasure. The vertically oriented compositions -- sky, land and water -- consistently feature gorgeously patterned ocean swells; Donwood balances abstraction and figuration, and builds rhymes across his pages. He also offers tiny details that reward an attentive viewer, as in the numerous small creatures lurking about, like the memorable rat surfing the waves on a fallen tree branch. Tiny eyes emerge out of the thickets of forest, easily overlooked on first glance. And there are moments of real suspense: Where will it end? Perhaps most strikingly, the narrative plays with the elasticity of time between panels, sometimes slowing down dramatically, sometimes speeding up.

If Donwood creates a stark allegory of the planet by focusing on one island, Matt Furie's MINDVISCOSITY (Fantagraphics, $39.99) displays a different kind of world-building, in which a colorful, playful, proliferative pop-culture-fueled vision is edged with humor and darkness in equal and uneasy measure. You can't blame Furie for feeling dark: This is the poor cartoonist who created Pepe the Frog, in his 2005 alternative comic book about four stoner friends, ""Boy's Club."" He then saw his benevolent, laid-back character -- known for peeing with his pants all the way down -- become a meme and an inescapable far-right hate symbol. (That transformation is detailed in the excellent new documentary ""Feels Good Man."")

Featuring a luxurious puffy cover complete with trippy holofoil title lettering (my 1-year-old couldn't stop playing with it), ""Mindviscosity"" is an art book more than a comics narrative, full of finely textured human-animal hybrids and other surreal entities, including several images depicting the death of Pepe-like figures (Furie officially ""killed"" his most famous character in a 2017 comic strip). The space it affords Furie to reclaim himself as an artist is a small measure of rebuke to the forces that loom ominously in our new world.","A new Graphic Content column reviews three books that cover a gamut of world-building, from the lives of Syrian refugees to the friends of Pepe the Frog.",4bc1c77a-607c-5ec5-a835-5786ca8dd97c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/23/books/review/NewWorld/NewWorld-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2645bc2616aa1169b1702206e1c32092e0b646552748f895af78601cc66816f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,From &ldquo;Welcome to the New World.&rdquo;,4bc1c77a-607c-5ec5-a835-5786ca8dd97c,N24News/imgs/4bc1c77a-607c-5ec5-a835-5786ca8dd97c.jpg,13
Real Estate,The House They Weren't Going to Buy,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/24/realestate/on-location-east-hampton-ny.html,"The House They Weren't Going to Buy

Josh Kay and Susana Simonpietri, the husband-and-wife partners of the Brooklyn interior design firm Chango & Co., had plenty of reasons to buy a second home in East Hampton, N.Y.

 ""We've been working out in the Hamptons pretty consistently since 2008,"" said Ms. Simonpietri, 38, adding that whenever she had to meet clients or supervise contractors, ""I'd drive six hours, there and back, in a day, which was not great."" They also loved the beachy feel and creative history of the area. But when she and Mr. Kay, 45, visited in March of last year, the timing was wrong to buy a house. They were in the middle of renovating their brownstone in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Ms. Simonpietri was pregnant with their first child, and they were about to leave on a trip to Paris.

The appointments were just to get a feeling for the market -- or, at least, that's what she told Mr. Kay. ""He said, 'As long as we're just looking,' "" she recalled. But then they saw a house that seemed ideal for them: a 2,100-square-foot, cedar-shingle saltbox built in 1973, with four bedrooms, two bathrooms and a pool, in the Springs hamlet of East Hampton. ""It had some really cool things that we saw right away,"" Ms. Simonpietri said. ""The living room was a double-story space with these super-skinny 1970s windows flanking the fireplace.""

The interiors had been updated over the years in ways the couple didn't like, but they were used to making cosmetic changes. ""We thought we could just turn it into a white box, and add our stuff,"" Ms. Simonpietri said. It was Mr. Kay who finally asked the question while they were driving back to Brooklyn: ""So are we going to make an offer?"" They did, and negotiated the contract from Paris, before closing last June for about $750,000. Expecting the arrival of their baby boy, Oliver, that August, they moved to renovate the house quickly, while attempting to keep costs low. With the general contracting company Craft Builders, they enlarged an opening between the living room and dining area, tore out carpeting in the master bedroom and removed the kitchen's upper cabinets, counters and floor. They installed hardwood flooring where it was lacking; V-groove paneling, open shelves and Carrara marble counters in the kitchen; and new bathroom vanities.

Then they washed nearly the whole interior in a wave of Benjamin Moore Decorator's White paint -- not just the walls and ceilings, but also the floors, the brick fireplace, the kitchen's cherry base cabinets and even the bathroom tile. The work was done in three weeks at a cost of about $70,000, and Mr. Kay and Ms. Simonpietri moved in with furniture and accessories they had bought in the preceding months, during their travels: rustic 19th-century chairs and a giant illuminated S sign from their trip to Paris; a living room sofa, rugs and baskets (which they transformed into pendant lamps for the dining area) found during a business trip to High Point, N.C.; and vintage pieces from online auctions, including a pair of beaten-up oversize coffee tables once owned by Tommy Hilfiger, from Julien's Auctions.

They agreed to leave their yard as it was, and thought they were finished by early July. But just as they were settling in, they heard chain saws nearby. Hoping that the people making the noise might be receptive to trimming a few overgrown trees and weeds, Mr. Kay set off to find the source. The workers wielding the chain saws, employees of the landscaping company Tri-R, were not only willing to clear some brush, but also agreed to undertake additional work for Mr. Kay and Ms. Simonpietri. Before long, the simple trimming job had evolved into a complete overhaul of the landscape. Over the course of the summer, the company cut down trees, graded the yard, put down sod, put in a new gravel driveway, installed cedar fences and bluestone paths, added landscape lighting and planted evergreens, bushy grasses and lavender. The work cost another $70,000 or so. ""The lesson here is don't follow the chain saws,"" Ms. Simonpietri said. Still, they have no regrets about buying a house they didn't intend to buy or doing landscaping they hadn't planned on. ""It's what we'd hoped it would be,"" Mr. Kay said of the end result. ""It's just so quiet and mellow."" As Ms. Simonpietri put it, ""We go there and our minds get reset.""","For a pair of designers in Brooklyn, getting a place in East Hampton just before the birth of their son was out of the question.

Dance,The Ballerina Who Got Away Comes Back,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/03/arts/dance/the-ballerina-who-got-away-comes-back.html,"When the Pacific Northwest Ballet principal dancer Carla Korbes announced in 2014 that she would retire at the end of the next season, at 33, it came as a bit of a shock. Ms. Korbes, whose performances were a marvel of musicality and clarity, surely had many more years of dancing ahead of her. New Yorkers were especially stricken -- they had had only a few glimpses of her in the past decade.

""I wasn't having fun anymore,"" she said recently via Skype, as she wrangled her 10-month-old son, Rafa, at home in Los Angeles, where she lives with her husband, Patrick Fraser, a photographer. Seemingly re-energized by her distance from the grind of company life and by her new job -- she is associate artistic director of Benjamin Millepied's L.A. Dance Project -- she's returning to the stage, but strictly on her own terms. She'll perform three short works, including Martha Graham's famous solo ""Lamentation"" and George Balanchine's ""Elegie,"" at Vail Dance Festival: ReMix at City Center, beginning on Thursday.

Thirty-three is relatively young for a top dancer to retire, unless struggling with a major injury. Most stay as long as they can, partly because few make plans beyond their dancing careers. ""I had in my mind I would stay until 40, 45 -- my idols in Brazil danced until their 50s,"" Ms. Korbes said. But, as she said at the time of the announcement, she found that she was tired of dancing through injuries.

For 10 years, Ms. Korbes, who is originally from Porto Alegre, Brazil, was a principal -- the star, really -- at Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle. New Yorkers thought of her as the one who got away. She had started her career at New York City Ballet in 2000, but left for Seattle five years later. She was hungry for a wider range of dance: ""I wanted to do works by William Forsythe and Nacho Duato and Merce Cunningham and the classics."" (City Ballet's repertory is more neoclassical, anchored in the ballets of George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins.) In the long run, though, it was this very diversity, and the lack of preparation that accompanied it, that led to her early exit.","Carla Körbes, edging away from her recent retirement, will perform three short works as part of Vail Dance Festival: ReMix at City Center.",497dd08d-fd11-55ce-a630-6ec222fd6fe6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/03/arts/03KORBES/03KORBES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=de3f740a841530e03e4d41388467fe98f36a1226d36ed009333ac9417db1fb0e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Carla Körbes in Martha Graham's ""Lamentation,"" which she will perform during Vail Dance Festival: ReMix at City Center.",497dd08d-fd11-55ce-a630-6ec222fd6fe6,N24News/imgs/497dd08d-fd11-55ce-a630-6ec222fd6fe6.jpg,6
Theater,Review: A Flock of Shylocks Transforms 'Merchant of Venice',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/theater/review-a-flock-of-shylocks-transforms-merchant-of-venice.html,"MONTCLAIR, N.J. -- The first gathering of the Shylocks is a sobering sight, instantly pushing comedy into the borders of tragedy. This chilling vision occurs halfway through what has thus far been an unusually blithe production of Shakespeare's ""The Merchant of Venice,"" directed by Karin Coonrod at the Alexander Kasser Theater at Montclair State University.

It is carnival time in Venice, and the air has been full of bright song and hedonistic yelps. But the music and the voices have turned harsh, and now Jew-baiting imprecations are fired like stones from slingshots. Five figures, identically dressed in gold-sashed robes, form a silent, protective huddle at the center of the stage.

Then one of them releases a prolonged howl that rends the night and stills the revelry. Shylock, the most infamous moneylender in literature, has just discovered that his daughter has absconded with his ducats to elope with a mercenary Christian.

The scream comes from the actress Lynda Gravatt, one of five performers portraying Shylock in the Compagnia de' Colombari's production of Shakespeare's thorny comedy of love and law, which runs through Sunday as part of Peak Performance's season of music, dance and theater works by women. The other Shylocks, who stand behind her, are of varied shape, age and ethnicity.",Karin Coonrod's inventive production of Shakespeare's notorious comedy has five actors playing the moneylender.

Travel,"A New Museum Explores 2,000 Years of Jewish Life in Italy",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/travel/jewish-history-museum-ferrara-italy.html,"The epigraph etched in Latin on the ancient stone tablet was short and tender : ""Claudia Aster, prisoner from Jerusalem."" Brought to Rome in chains after the quelling of the revolt in Jerusalem in 70 A.D., she was apparently the concubine of a Roman notable who wanted to give her a dignified burial and added an unusual element to the funerary stone. ""I pray,"" it said, ""take care and follow the law that no one should remove the inscription."" That tribute is one of many revelations at the new Museum of Italian Judaism and the Shoah in Ferrara, and is at the heart of the museum's first major exhibition, ""Jews, an Italian Story . The First Thousand Years,"" which examines the long and complex relationship between Rome and Jerusalem, Christianity and Judaism. Jews have lived on the Italian peninsula for more than 2,000 years, one of the oldest communities in the Western Diaspora. Even before the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem, then the centerpiece of Judaism, and the ensuing transport and enslavement of Jewish prisoners to Rome, there had been Jews living in the city and southern provinces, where they had arrived as traders and refugees.

However, there is another part to the Italian Jewish story, one of acceptance, integration and even appreciation throughout the long arc of civilization on the peninsula. ""The historic dialogue with the culture of Italy has enriched Italian Judaism and has also brought to the Italian culture much of Jewish values and contribution,"" said Simonetta Della Seta, who was appointed the museum's director in 2016. As the museum moves chronologically through the eras of Italian history, additions are being made to the permanent exhibit. The second major exhibit opened in April, on Jews and the Renaissance. The Holocaust will be addressed by the museum with a permanent exhibition that will open in September.

So why choose a former prison to house the new museum? ""The challenge is to take a place where people were closed in, where it was dark; transform it into an open space, open to ideas, open to culture, open to dialogue, and this is our mission,"" Ms. Della Seta said. The museum's collection of more than 200 artifacts and multimedia installations supports that alternative narrative, of coexistence and contribution. A fifth-century mosaic of two matronae, one with the Old Testament, the second with the New, shows a single community of faith, a chapter in an otherwise fraught relationship with Christianity. There are precious documents and instruments depicting Jewish contributions to medicine, science and astronomy.

Also on display are fragments of ancient manuscripts and texts, highlighting the importance of literacy in Italian Jewish history. ""Jews for centuries were the writers, the scribes. Then they became the printers of the Italians,"" Ms. Della Seta said. She noted that among the first publishers in Italy during the medieval era were the Jewish printing houses in Venice and Soncino. Ferrara represents what was, for a time, a golden era of Italian Jewry. It was the policy of the Duke of Este in the 16th century to welcome Sephardic exiles from Spain and other Jews to the city, a period when the Church was ascendant and Jews were being confined to ghettos in Rome and Venice.

""Jews have been living in Ferrara for over 1,000 years,"" Mr. Pesaro said as we stood in front of the synagogue building on Via Mazzini, 95, on its original site since 1603 and renovated many times since then. It is now being repaired after sustaining serious damage from the earthquake of 2012. The building is simple, red-bricked and almost undistinguishable from others on the street except for the two plaques next to the arched entrance, commemorating the victims of the Holocaust from Ferrara. There are two synagogues inside. The larger, the Ashkenazi synagogue, with its barrel-vaulted ceiling, multiple chandeliers and bright Jewish drawings on the walls, contrasts with the simple dark wooden pews and Torah ark. A walk through the former ghetto with Mr. Pesaro provides a moving glimpse into a distant time. Via Mazzini, once the main ghetto street, is now dotted with cafes and shops. It bustles with bicyclists riding to the nearby main square of the historic district, dominated by the cathedral and moat-ringed castle. Jewish life is invisible to all but the most discerning pedestrians.

Two narrow cobblestone streets, adjacent to Via Mazzini, form the more recognizable heart of the ghetto. We walked on one, Via Vignatagliata, as Mr. Pesaro pointed out buildings that once housed the matzo bakery (No. 49) and the Jewish school (No. 79), whose numbers swelled after Jews were barred from attending public schools by the racial laws of 1938. On the left is a small square, Piazzetta Isacco Lampronti, named after a renowned rabbi, scholar and physician of the 18th century. At night, however, when the winding, narrow streets seem so melancholy under dim lights, it is easy to imagine that dark time for Ferrara's Jews. The Jewish cemetery, outside the ghetto, is startling, if only for its sprawl and large grassy areas, free of headstones. When I asked Mr. Pesaro where all the gravestones had gone, he explained that the marble and stone were taken during the Inquisition in the 18th century, when some were used to build the two pillars framing the municipal hall across from the cathedral. The cemetery draws many visitors, Italian and foreign, mainly to pay tribute to Giorgio Bassani, the distinguished Jewish writer from Ferrara, best known for his novel, ""The Garden of the Finzi Continis."" A tilting bronze headstone, with a jagged facade that pierces through a stone base, marks his grave, isolated in the cemetery. The book, later made into a movie by the same name, is about a wealthy Jewish family contending with the racial laws of 1938 and about to be engulfed by the Holocaust. It is a source of contention for Mr. Pesaro and others in the community, who feel Bassani offended his family, on whom the book seems to be based, by depicting them and the Jews of Ferrara as out of touch with fascism and their impending doom.

The museum is a public, state-funded institution, proclaimed by the Parliament of Italy in 2003. Originally conceived as a museum of the Holocaust, its mission was changed later to encompass the history and heritage of Italian Jewry. It was inaugurated on Dec. 13, 2017, in two of the former prison buildings that were renovated and designed by an international team based in Milan. Four new buildings, designed to look like five, inspired by the books of the Torah, are to be added so that by its completion in 2021, the museum will contain nearly 100,000 square feet of space, at an estimated cost of $50 million. At the entrance, visitors are encouraged to watch a 24-minute video (in English and Italian) that conveys the sweep of Italian Jewish history through individual stories -- a Jewish slave, deported from Jerusalem to Rome in the first century, a scholar from the Middle Ages who enjoys a privileged status, and a young girl in 1938, forced to leave school as a result of the racial laws. Following that compressed virtual history, a short walk leads to the second building, crossing an educational garden where visitors can learn about Jewish dietary laws. The ""First Thousand Years"" exhibition is largely focused on Rome and the southern regions -- Sicily, Puglia, Campania, Calabria -- as that is where Jews mainly settled during the first millennium. After passing a replica of the Arch of Titus, commemorating Rome's victory over Jerusalem, and depicting soldiers carrying the seven-branched menorah, visitors are offered a well-lit and spacious display of original and replicated artifacts: ancient engravings, amulets, rings, seals and oil lamps with Jewish symbols, medieval manuscripts, some now on permanent loan from other national Italian museums.

There are complete chambers, simulating the Jewish catacombs in Rome, their walls adorned with frescoes of menorahs, other religious symbols and Hebrew lettering. ""The Jewish catacombs in Rome were a treasure trove for our knowledge of Jews in the Imperial Age, about 40,000 people,"" said Ms. Della Seta. The display is thematic as well as chronological. The dispersal of Jews throughout the Italian peninsula, the relationship between Jews and Christians, the contribution of Jewish scholarship and science to the broader civilization. Video monitors are strategically placed featuring experts -- historians, archaeologists and rabbis -- explaining their choice of artifacts or historical events. What comes across throughout the two-floor exhibition is the breadth and tenacity of Jewish life over the millenniums. The Italian peninsula witnessed serial conquerors -- Romans, Goths, Byzantines Longobards and Muslims -- who are all gone. Yet the one continuous presence has been the Jews, clinging to their identity and civilization in the face of severe challenges to their survival. There are about 30,000 Jews living in Italy today, the majority in Rome and Milan, according to the Union of Italian Jewish Communities, an umbrella organization. The mission of the museum, said Dario Disegni, chairman of MEIS, is to foster dialogue, understanding and coexistence. ""The MEIS tells the story of a minority, which was integrated in the Italian society and, at the same time, was able to maintain its identity, both cultural and religious, without being assimilated. It is really a model, a point of reference for the Italian and, more generally, Western societies of today."" It is a message, at a time when Italy and other European countries are being tested by a new wave of immigration and rising intolerance, that might give MEIS a broader resonance and purpose than that usually associated with a history museum.

Style,PowerPoint Is the Most Efficient Way for Kids to Manage Their Parents,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/style/kids-who-use-powerpoint-to-ask-for-things.html,"Cade Collins, 14, tried to convince his parents to get a second dog with a PowerPoint presentation. (*The proposed dog's picture was ""borrowed"" from the internet, so we couldn't publish it here.)



PowerPoint Is the Most Efficient Way for Kids to Manage Their Parents

Makennah Gatica, who is in eighth grade in Lubbock, Tex., knows exactly what she wants for Christmas: record albums, Puma sneakers, posters and slippers, all relating to her love of BTS, the South Korean boy band. To convince her mother to buy some of these items, Makennah, who is 13, created an 85-slide PowerPoint presentation. The slide show begins with a visual explainer of the K-pop music genre: images of the musicians making silly faces and an embedded video of them that Makennah has labeled ""iCoNiC."" The demonstration next zeros in on coveted items of ""BTS murch"" (meaning, obviously, merchandise). Slide 17 reveals a publicity photo of the seven male band members, with an overlaid caption Makennah wrote that says, ""I'm going to give you a list of things I would have an enormous amount of gratitude for :)"" Rather than just emailing the document, she delivered its contents in person, standing before her mother to make the full audiovisual pitch. ""I like to add music and do my own intros and stuff,"" Makennah said.

Though some presentations are made with Google Slides or Apple's Keynote, PowerPoint also seems to be the dominant tool, creating yet another instance for young people to embrace a Microsoft product (the company also owns Minecraft and Xbox). The children say that their polished presentations serve a few purposes. They convey to parents that what is being asked for really matters. They also let them make an entire case without being interrupted by a parent's quick ""no."" ""With a PowerPoint it was a little bit more impactful because they could see the amount of effort and work I put into it instead of just my usual begging,"" said Lucy Frisch, 14, an equestrian from New York who made a presentation a few years ago to ask her parents to buy her a horse. She did not manage to close the deal. Still, her presentation showed to her parents that Lucy's interest in riding was not fleeting, and convinced her father that the family should commit as many resources as possible to her riding.

How to Get a Puppy A key strategy is to be prepared in advance with answers to your parents' objections, said Cade Collins, 14, from Maryville, Tenn. On the occasion of his brother Luke's birthday last year, Cade sat his parents in their living room, turned down the lights, streamed some soft jazz, lit a candles and dressed in a T-shirt with a picture of a puppy on it. Then he unleashed upon his parents a PowerPoint pressure-tation entitled, ""Reasons Why We Need to get a Wing Pup."" The family already had a dog, Cooper, age 10, whom the family had nicknamed ""the Wing."" But Luke wanted a duck-hunting dog and relatives were offering a black Labrador from a new litter. The boys' parents, Vallie and Steve Collins, didn't want a puppy to distract the boys from their responsibility of walking and picking up after Cooper. Plus, they were trying to sell their house and they didn't think it was smart to take on a needy, messy new pet. In a slide that he headlined ""I Know What Your Thinking,"" Cade wrote, ""I've heard it from you mom, 'We would but there is just too much stress with moving houses.' Well, boy do I have an answer for you. Studies have shown that when petting a dog your body releases a number of 'feel good' hormones, such as serotonin, prolactin and oxytocin. There for releasing stress."" (He meant ""you're"" and ""they're"" but that's not the point here.) ""Coopers years are numbered and he is slowing down, but a younger energetic presence wouldn't hurt and may improve his lifestyle,"" he added. (See slide four, ""Lets Face It."") What did Mr. and Ms. Collins say? What do you think? But before Willie joined the family (they named the new dog after Willie Nelson!), the boys had to sign a contract promising that they would clean up accidents, monitor the pup's furniture-chewing and keep him fed and groomed. ""We replied to the PowerPoint with our own official documents,"" said Ms. Collins.

It's not just about getting parents to spring for new sneakers and animals. Makennah of Lubbock has also used PowerPoint for more quotidian request: to convince her mom to let her wear a little makeup. ""I'm quick to be convinced by her,"" said Marla Castro, her mother. ""She has me dumbfounded a lot."" Also sometimes young people simply want their parents' blessing. Last Christmas, Maria Stopenski, then 19, had bought a ticket to a meet-and-greet with Niall Horan, the singer famous for being in the boy band One Direction. Ms. Stopenski, who attends the University of Pittsburgh and whose family lives in Pittsburgh, didn't want money from her parents for the ticket. She wanted their O.K. Her parents weren't thrilled about her driving all the way to North Carolina for the event -- and she didn't feeling comfortable going without their permission. ""I needed them to see how dedicated I am. So I said, 'Mom, if I make a PowerPoint will you let me go?' she said. ""Sure, make a PowerPoint and we'll see,"" her mother said. A few days later, Ms. Stopenski set up a life-size cutout of Mr. Horan and hooked her laptop to the family's living-room TV. She devoted a few slides to explaining the appeal of Mr. Horan, just in case it wasn't readily apparent to her parents: ""He is 5'9"" so basically he is the perfect height for me"" and ""He loves golf,"" one said. ""He sings good"" and ""I like his brown hair more than his blonde hair,"" said another. She explained how much the travel, hotel and concert would cost and how she had budgeted to keep costs low. One of the final slides included a photograph of Mr. Horan, applauding in an audience. Ms. Stopenski's caption said, ""Niall is clapping in this picture because he is so impressed at how dedicated I am to him."" ""They said 'yes' right away,"" she said. This year she wants to go to Toronto to see Shawn Mendes. ""Do you want me to make a PowerPoint? Because I will,"" Ms. Stopenski asked her mother. ""I don't think that will be necessary,"" her mom said. Ask for the Right Things For some, the process of creating and delivering a presentation is less about dazzling parents than crystallizing for their own selves how strongly they want something. Last month, Dwayne Neff, 17, a high-school senior in Park Forest, Ill., set up a time to meet with his parents and had his PowerPoint on the TV screen when they came into the living room. He needed $250 to buy a ticket to the Travis Scott concert. Dwayne thought if he simply asked for the money, his parents would say no before he got the words out. Thanks to his slide show, Dwayne, an aspiring musical artist, was able to make his argument.

""Travis Scott is my favorite artist and makes my favorite music and pushes me to be better musically,"" said one slide. In another, Dwayne laid out his financial realities (""I cut grass today which gives me $120 that's all I have to offer it's not much but it's a try"") and highlighted his improving report card (""Last week it was an F in Math now were looking at an 81% and I only got two questions wrong on last quiz""). After, ""they even told me that if I had just asked, they would say 'no' but that they would see what they could do because I put in time and effort,"" he said. ""We don't always take him seriously, because his approach to things sometimes can be somewhat colorful,"" Dwayne's mother, Stephanie Neff, wrote in an email.

In their pitch, titled ""Paradise,"" the children wrote, ""Don't get us wrong we love summer and the things we do and the places we visit. But there are definitely room for improvement."" Against the backdrop of stock images of log cabins and other buildings they found doing a Google image search for ""small country house,"" the Regan kids laid out the case to splurge on a vacation home. Their reasons included, ""We could go camping right outside our house"" and ""It would be a great place to park and keep Uncle Richard's truck."" ""It didn't work as well as it did with my soccer idea,"" Charlie said.",The most solid method for kids to achieve their goals?

Sports,Giants' General Manager Is Noncommittal on Eli Manning's Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/sports/ny-giants-eli-manning.html,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. -- Giants General Manager Dave Gettleman gave a rousing endorsement of Coach Pat Shurmur, stood behind his decision to draft running back Saquon Barkley and laughed off suggestions that the team might trade receiver Odell Beckham Jr. But Gettleman, in his first news conference with reporters since the summer, remained surprisingly noncommittal on Wednesday about quarterback Eli Manning's future with the Giants, leaving the door open for the organization to potentially move on from its two-time Super Bowl most valuable player this off-season. ""We will do what's in the best interest of the New York Giants,"" Gettleman said, before adding: ""What we're trying to do here is build sustained success. That takes some brutal honesty, and it takes some tough decisions."" Gettleman said he and Manning had met for an ""extensive"" conversation on Monday that he deemed to be ""very honest and upfront."" Notably, it was Manning who initiated the discussion.

""Eli came in and wanted to talk,"" Gettleman said. ""It wasn't like he was called to the principal's office; he came to see me.""

Manning, who turns 38 on Thursday and is under contract through the 2019 season, started all 16 games for the Giants this season and threw for 4,299 yards with 21 touchdowns and 11 interceptions. He completed 66 percent of his passes, a career high, and finished with a 92.4 quarterback rating, his highest since 2015. But the Giants started with a 1-7 record this season before finishing 5-11, and they have an 8-23 record over the past two years with Manning as the starter. There are questions about his pocket presence, decision-making and arm strength -- including from Beckham, who criticized Manning in an interview with ESPN in October. Gettleman pointed to the offense's productivity in December, when the Giants scored 30, 40, 27 and 35 points (they also were shut out by the Tennessee Titans on Dec. 16). ""He still can make N.F.L. throws,"" Gettleman said of Manning. ""He's still got it."" Shurmur shares that opinion, having defended Manning throughout the season -- and especially in recent weeks regarding the quarterback's ability to return as the Giants' starter in 2019. On Monday, he said Manning should be evaluated based on his performance in the second half of the season.

""I think he was better able to showcase what he could do once we solidified the offensive line,"" Shurmur said. ""I think that's a fair assessment."" As for how he planned to assess Manning's performance amid the swings in fortune throughout the season, Gettleman was less effusive. He said he would watch film ""until my eyes bleed."" Manning has a full no-trade clause, and cutting him would incur a sizable hit to the Giants' salary cap. Nevertheless, Gettleman said, ""everything is on the table for us."" Gettleman executed an extensive roster overhaul this season, his first as the team's general manager. But the Giants still finished last in the N.F.C. East, leaving them with the No. 6 overall pick in the coming draft. This year's class is not expected to contain the same caliber of quarterback prospects as last year, when the quarterbacks Baker Mayfield, Sam Darnold, Josh Rosen and Josh Allen all went in the first 10 slots of the draft. Still, Gettleman defended his decision to draft Barkley, a running back, with the second overall pick in 2018. Barkley ran for 1,307 yards, a Giants rookie record, and added 721 yards receiving. ""If I was in that situation 100 times, I'd draft him 100 times,"" Gettleman said of Barkley. His assessment of the 2019 draft options remained the same as a year ago, he said, but he did not rule out selecting a quarterback. The Giants did select a quarterback in the fourth round last summer, Kyle Lauletta, who struggled in his lone appearance of the season, going 0 for 5 with one interception during the second half against Washington on Dec. 9. ""You're going to take the best player available,"" Gettleman said.

Sports,The Clothing Brand Coogi Is Suing the Nets Over Notorious B.I.G.-Inspired Jerseys,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/sports/coogi-nets-lawsuit-jerseys.html,"Since moving to Brooklyn in 2012, the Nets have closely aligned their brand with that of Christopher Wallace, the rapper known as the Notorious B.I.G., who grew up a brisk walk from where Barclays Center was later built to host the N.B.A. But a special version of the team's jersey, with a design inspired by Wallace, is at the center of a copyright violation lawsuit against the Nets, the N.B.A. and Nike filed by the clothing brand Coogi in Manhattan federal court Wednesday.

Before the season, the Nets debuted their new Nike-manufactured ""City Edition"" jerseys, which feature a multicolored striped pattern down the sides that the team called ""Brooklyn Camo."" In marketing materials, the team said the jerseys were inspired by Wallace.

The ""Brooklyn Camo"" pattern bears a close resemblance to patterns Coogi has used in its clothing for years, and for which it claims to have over 300 design copyrights. Coogi, a New York-based brand, is also heavily associated with Wallace. The rapper was photographed in Coogi's clothing, and he referred to the brand in at least two of his songs, including the hit ""Hypnotize.""","Coogi has accused the Nets, Nike and the N.B.A. of violating its copyright on colorful striped design patterns affiliated with the '90s Brooklyn rapper.",9afec975-6c9d-51cc-8ce6-6f0c27bc7911,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/sports/01netslawsuit-print/01netslawsuit-alternate-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1ed2e8e473cae783107b34e121538b48183e10718efabec611e8e216c85cc4c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,D&rsquo;Angelo Russell and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson have worn Brooklyn Camo shooting sleeves in addition to the City Edition jerseys.,9afec975-6c9d-51cc-8ce6-6f0c27bc7911,N24News/imgs/9afec975-6c9d-51cc-8ce6-6f0c27bc7911.jpg,9
Travel,The Plastic-Hunting Pirates of the Cornish Coast,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/travel/clean-ocean-sailing.html,"The Cornish coast -- with its high cliffs and inlets, lining the peninsula that juts out from England's southwest corner -- has a long association with pirates. Its rocky coves, secret anchorages and long winding creeks have historically been a haunting ground for seafaring scoundrels and salty sea dogs. Today, it is the home of an entirely different breed of renegade. Since 2017, Steve Green and Monika Hertlova have been setting sail in their 112-year-old boat to remove plastic pollution from the coastline's worst affected areas. In the three years since they began operating -- under the banner of Clean Ocean Sailing and alongside a team of dedicated volunteers -- they have removed over 44,000 pounds of plastic waste from areas of land that are inaccessible by foot.

I met Steve and Monika in the galley of their boat, which is also their home, and which they share with their one-year-old son, Simon, and their labrador, Rosie. They pored over maps and weather reports as 90 bananas swung from the ceiling above them. The fruit, along with other supplies, had been donated to the team by local businesses eager to support what is meant to be a 60-mile round-trip voyage to the remote Isles of Scilly, an archipelago some 30 miles southwest of Cornwall.

For skipper Steve, the Scillys are where Clean Ocean Sailing began. ""I was caught by a freak wind and washed up on Annet,"" he said, referring to the one of the archipelago's many small islands. ""It's only a mile across, but I ended up having to spend a few days there. On the southwest of the island, it is six-foot deep of all sorts of plastic flotsam and jetsam -- full of dead or dying seabirds and dolphins."" Since then, Steve and Monica have returned regularly to Annet with a crew of citizen activists to help tackle the island's pollution problem. They planned to return again in February, and offered me a spot on the boat. But because of recent storms -- Britain had just been battered by the deadly storm Ciara, and the Coast Guard warned of further ""danger to life"" posed by the rapidly approaching Storm Dennis -- they decided not to risk the open waters of a long crossing, and opted instead to stick closer to home.

We were armed with a plan to clean 10 of Cornwall's most polluted beaches over a 10-day period, and, in true piratical nature, to hide from the worst of the storms in the natural harbors and caves of the coast, where we'd spend each night. We settled into what we hoped would become a familiar rhythm: We'd drop anchor on the 60-foot schooner, then disembark in a flotilla of smaller canoes and rowing boats to land and edge our way along the rocky shore, gathering plastic along the way.

Volunteers and marine conservation authorities arrived moments too late. We later read that she was a fin whale, the second-largest creature on earth. This was a juvenile, and chronically malnourished. Over 60 feet long, the poor creature was doomed as soon as she left the water, her organs unable to support her weight. We returned back to the boat, clutching our plastic. Weighed down by the traumas of the first day, our tempo on the water was slow. Winds howled and rattled across the deck of the boat. At night, we listened to the sound of straining ropes and chains.

Perhaps most surprising was the condition of the items: an empty packet of chips from 15 years ago seemed as structurally sound as one you might pick up from a grocery shelf. All of the waste was hoisted back on deck and securely strapped down.

Simon Myers, a volunteer who joined the expedition with his 17-year-old son, Milo, said that the experience gave him a new perspective on climate change, overconsumption and plastic pollution. Before the voyage, he said, it seemed that many such problems were happening elsewhere -- ""somewhere low lying, somewhere where they don't know how to process litter."" ""But now we know the problem is everywhere,"" he said. ""It's happening on our doorstep. It's coming home to roost.""",The Clean Ocean Sailing initiative removes plastic waste from areas of England's coastline that are inaccessible by foot.,0106d71d-7f63-56a9-a06e-6819c3cae980,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/25/travel/23travel-cleanocean-promo/25travel-cleanocean-05-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9d2a4d2f65ac41b536bcd3a9a1b12473b6834e461ae1b3f94ef950d854da5d33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Simon Myers, who volunteered on a recent Clean Ocean Sailing expedition with his son, Milo.",0106d71d-7f63-56a9-a06e-6819c3cae980,N24News/imgs/0106d71d-7f63-56a9-a06e-6819c3cae980.jpg,4
Science,"For Neanderthals, Growing Big Brains Took More Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/science/neanderthal-brain-growth.html,"The skeleton of an 8-year-old Neanderthal boy recovered from the El Sidron cave in Spain.

We modern humans like to boast about our big brains, but the Neanderthals seem to have had even larger ones. A recent analysis of a 49,000-year-old skeleton belonging to a Neanderthal child suggests a surprising difference between them and us: Neanderthal brains appear to have grown to maturity more slowly than those of Homo sapiens. Developing a clearer understanding of the reasons for the similarities and differences in Neanderthal and Homo sapiens growth patterns could one day help scientists better understand our evolutionary history and how we came to be as we are today. ""What we saw is that it took longer for them to get their big brains,"" said Antonio Rosas, a paleoanthropologist from The National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in Science.

Dr. Rosas and his team studied ancient Neanderthal remains recovered from a cave system in Spain known as El Sidron, where archaeologists have found the remains of more than a dozen individuals, including the child's mother and younger brother. The first thing the researchers needed to do with their child specimen was determine how old he was. So they peeked inside his mouth, which had a mix of 30 baby and adult teeth. By cutting into his teeth they were able to use a microscope to count bands in the enamel, which grow similarly to tree rings. From their investigation they determined the child was just under eight years old when he died. They did not find any signs on his bones that would have clued them into the cause of his death. By investigating the boy's cranium, the researchers found that it was only 87.5 percent the size of a full grown Neanderthal's cranium. That differs from anatomically modern human children, who at age seven have craniums that are about 95 percent the size of an adult's.

Though the team did not have the child's complete skull, they were able to compare the available fragments with a skull from a different Neanderthal and reconstruct the missing parts. The team also found the Neanderthal child still had several unfused vertebrae. In modern human children, those vertebrae are fused around the ages of four to six. Despite the differences in brain and spine development, the team found that in many ways the Neanderthal child was no different from a modern human child, especially in the elbows, wrists, hands and knees. Both seem to have experienced similar growth patterns, like having arms and legs that grew slowly between infancy and puberty, according to Dr. Rosas.","New research suggests that the brain of a juvenile Neanderthal developed more slowly than that of a similarly aged Homo sapiens child, but scientists don't yet know why.",204bee96-dbbb-5749-aa79-d3ee18d553d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/22/science/22TB-NEANDERTHAL1/22TB-NEANDERTHAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=93fade93568c8b6347fb8ed882e848515523407bc66770724d0b5fb4b55b26ad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The skeleton of an 8-year-old Neanderthal boy recovered from the El Sidrón cave in Spain.,204bee96-dbbb-5749-aa79-d3ee18d553d7,N24News/imgs/204bee96-dbbb-5749-aa79-d3ee18d553d7.jpg,2
Your Money,"For College Students, So Many Health Plans to Choose From",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/your-money/financial-planners/for-college-students-so-many-health-plans-to-choose-from.html,"If you're headed to college this fall, you've no doubt planned to pack your laptop, your bedding and your favorite music. But have you figured out your health insurance? The Affordable Care Act is offering more health coverage choices to young adults, including college and graduate students, said Jen Mishory, deputy director of Young Invincibles, a nonprofit group focused on economic issues affecting young Americans. ""There's going to be options out there to compare and contrast and figure out,"" she said. For starters, if you're under 26 and your parents have health insurance that offers coverage for family members, the law allows you to stay on their plan in many cases. The government says more than three million people have already gained coverage as a result of this provision, which took effect in 2010. It applies even if you are financially independent, and whether you are single or married. Costs are going up, though, as some plans now charge an additional premium for family members added to the plan. College students have to consider other twists, too. Suppose your parents' plan requires that you use a local network of doctors, but you're attending school out of state. Martin Rosen, co-founder of Health Advocate Inc., which helps workers navigate their health benefits, said you should review your parents' plan before relying on it for coverage during college. If it is a health maintenance organization or preferred-provider plan and you seek care out of network, he said, ""you're going to have less coverage, or you'll pay more money for it.""

In that case, you may want to consider a health plan offered by your college. While student plans have until January to provide the full menu of ""essential"" health benefits mandated by the Affordable Care Act, many colleges are already offering plans that meet the requirements, said Jennifer Haubenreiser, the immediate past president of the American College Health Association. It's important, however, to check specifics. Self-insured college plans -- those in which the school pays claims directly, instead of hiring an insurance company to do so -- don't have to meet the law's essential-benefits requirement, said Sara Collins, a health insurance expert at the Commonwealth Fund. But again, some colleges are meeting them anyway. Northeastern University in Boston, for instance, says that even though it is self-insured, its health plan will include benefits that ""meet or exceed"" the law's requirements. While benefits in student plans are expanding because of the law, premiums are increasing, too, said Stephen Beckley, a college insurance consultant in Fort Collins, Colo. The average annual premium for a student plan at a private four-year college is now about $2,200.

So for comparison, you may want to look at policies available on the new exchanges in October, to see if you can find a cheaper plan. States are starting to approve insurance plans for their exchanges, and some premium estimates are lower than had been expected, but final financial information isn't available yet. Coverage purchased on the exchange would start in January. If you already have school coverage for the fall, the ability to switch plans in midyear depends on your school. Some colleges offer only annual enrollment, while others allow students to withdraw at the end of a semester if they can acquire comparable insurance, Mr. Beckley said. Jillian Foster, 29, who will attend New York University as a graduate student this fall, is uninsured and says she will evaluate her health plan options later this summer. She is too old to stay on her parents' plan, but is looking forward to having some sort of basic coverage again -- either through her college, or perhaps through an exchange, if the coverage is less expensive. ""My budget is quite tight,"" she said. Many private four-year colleges automatically enroll students in their health plans, but allow students to opt out if they are covered under a comparable plan. One possible advantage of school plans is that they typically are considered an education cost for financial-aid purposes, so their cost often may be wrapped into a student's aid package, Ms. Haubenreiser of the college health association said. If you're wondering about your options, here are some questions to consider: 1. Can I choose between my parents' plan and the exchanges? If you're financially dependent on your parents, and qualify for coverage under their health plan, you're generally not eligible for subsidized coverage on the exchanges, Ms. Collins said. 2. How can I get coverage on the exchanges at a minimal premium? The exchanges will offer ""catastrophic"" plans for young people, which offer preventive care but carry low premiums, but have higher out-of-pocket costs. There's a question, however, about whether such plans will meet some colleges' minimum coverage requirements, Ms. Haubenreiser said. 3. Aside from my parents' plan and the exchanges, are there other low-cost options? One possibility may be Medicaid, the federal-state insurance program for low-income people. Traditionally, Medicaid coverage has been limited to children, pregnant women and the disabled. But under the health care law, some states are expanding eligibility to cover low-income adults. ""It's not impossible that some students could qualify for Medicaid,"" Mr. Rosen said.","The Affordable Care Act is offering more health coverage choices to young adults, including college students, than ever before.",402ed41c-b6a4-51ea-93f3-a5858ba236de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/08/24/business/Adviser/Adviser-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=d5dfb48e779963aeae03802cb8a67b3cf150a51231fb49b93ab31bcb91a0c006&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Affordable Care Act may give college students like Marche Curry, left, an alternative to college health insurance plans.",402ed41c-b6a4-51ea-93f3-a5858ba236de,N24News/imgs/402ed41c-b6a4-51ea-93f3-a5858ba236de.jpg,21
Food,A Roast Chicken With Even More Crispy Bits,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/dining/parmesan-roast-chicken-recipe.html,"The meat of a roast chicken is all well and good, but it's the skin that I really adore. Getting it as crisp and burnished as possible is my goal for every bird; if I can hear it crackle like a potato chip, I know I've gotten close.

Strategies for achieving this abound. You can leave the bird uncovered in the fridge overnight, or blast it with a hair dryer. You can rub it down with salt or baking powder or both. Some cooks recommend separating the skin from the flesh, poking holes as you go to release the fat. All of these methods work, to varying degrees.

But the fastest, simplest and perhaps most delicious way to get chicken skin as crunchy as a strip of fried bacon is to turn it into a giant frico -- that is, to coat the bird with enough grated Parmesan so that, as it roasts, the skin turns into one big, salty, schmaltz-infused cheese wafer.","You can rub your bird down with salt, or you can try Melissa Clark's latest trick for an exterior that crackles like a potato chip.",49def222-5d12-546b-8273-7b3bf18b9fd9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/dining/10Appe1/merlin_166828719_ab2d8ab2-77ea-46c7-a29c-b9ebee55d8ab-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c758854f96b18822fb65c8c3e7715a603bdb312de538ebdcf78a2a1597968ec5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Don't forget the pan drippings here: They're a bright, lemony counterpoint to the tender meat.",49def222-5d12-546b-8273-7b3bf18b9fd9,N24News/imgs/49def222-5d12-546b-8273-7b3bf18b9fd9.jpg,17
Health,Obamacare Returns as Galvanizing Issue After Ginsburg Death and Barrett Nomination,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/health/obamacare-supreme-court-barrett-ginsburg.html,"WASHINGTON -- Less than six weeks before the election, the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg has injected fresh urgency into an issue that had dropped down the list of voter priorities this year: the future of the Affordable Care Act. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Nov. 10 in a case, which the Trump administration has filed briefs supporting, that seeks to overturn the law. Mr. Trump's nomination of Amy Coney Barrett, who has criticized the court's 2012 decision to uphold it, increases the chance of that happening. Liberal advocacy groups are using the prospect to whip up new advertisements declaring that President Trump ""wants to rush a justice onto the court who will repeal our health care,"" as one says. Democrats in Congress have sprung into action with news conferences and pep talks to campaign volunteers featuring people with pre-existing medical conditions who were able to get coverage because of the law. The Biden campaign, too, made clear upon Justice Ginsburg's death that it would frame the court fight largely as one about health care. Even if Democrats have little chance of blocking Judge Barrett's confirmation, they are hoping to reignite the public passion to protect the law that helped Democrats recapture the House in 2018, a year after Republicans in Congress came close to repealing it. This time, party leaders are quick to point out, the election is coming amid a pandemic that has left many Americans requiring expensive medical care, including for potentially long-term health problems that insurers could refuse to cover if the law and its protections with people for pre-existing conditions were repealed.

""That was the issue that drove the 2018 campaign so substantially -- it came right after a very, very clear threat,"" said Chris Jennings, a longtime Democratic strategist on health care who is advising Joseph R. Biden's campaign. ""This time, the fear of a takeaway was not as great. But now it's re-engaged and credible."" The number of uninsured people in the United States decreased by 20 million from 2010 to 2016, as the A.C.A. went into effect. Its major provisions include allowing states to expand Medicaid to cover more low-income adults, setting up insurance markets where individuals earning less than about $51,000 a year can get subsidies to help pay their premiums and barring insurers from placing annual or lifetime limits on how much care they would cover. But 42 percent of Americans still view it unfavorably, according to one recent poll, likely including many middle-class families who earn too much for the law's financial assistance and find the high level of coverage it requires unaffordable. Mr. Trump, attempting to neutralize the threat to his campaign posed by the pre-existing conditions issue -- one that affects as many as 133 million Americans -- signed an executive order on Thursday declaring it is the policy of the United States for people with pre-existing health conditions to be protected. But he offered no details on how he planned to assure that while also seeking to invalidate the A.C.A. His own Justice Department filed a brief in June asking the Supreme Court to overturn the entire law, including its pre-existing conditions protections. In 2017, Judge Coney Barrett wrote an academic article questioning a Supreme Court decision that upheld the law in 2012. She also signed a petition in 2012 protesting the law's requirement that insurance plans offered by most employers cover contraception; the Trump administration has since expanded exemptions to the rule, a move upheld by the high court. In the weeks before Justice Ginsburg's death, poll respondents listed health care below the economy and the coronavirus response as an issue of importance to them. A poll conducted in early September by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research organization, found that only 10 percent of registered voters considered health care the most important issue in deciding their vote for president. In a NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted shortly before Justice Ginsburg's death last week, 24 percent listed health care as a top issue, compared with 40 percent for the economy.

With most voters already firmly in Mr. Trump's or Mr. Biden's camp -- and the election a referendum on Mr. Trump more than any one issue -- it is not clear how much the court vacancy will change the equation, even around the margins. But Democrats are not alone in seeing the vacancy as a potential flame to reignite fervor for protecting the law and especially its most popular provision: protecting people with pre-existing conditions from getting charged more or rejected by insurance companies. Mr. Trump on Thursday devoted a speech in North Carolina to the subject, leaning into a much-repeated promise to continue protections for people with pre-existing conditions by issuing an executive order, a largely symbolic document that does not have the teeth of legislation. People priced out of coverage by the law cannot benefit from those protections anyway, his aides told reporters on a briefing call before the speech. That argument should resonate with people like Rafael Gonzalez, an independent voter who owns a small landscaping company in Miami. At 53, he is uninsured after deciding he could not afford the $700 monthly premiums for the plans available to him under the law. He does not qualify for federal subsidies to offset the cost because his income is over the cutoff, making him just the type of voter whom Trump health officials are targeting when they point out that the Affordable Care Act protections are meaningless to people who can't afford to buy insurance. Yet Mr. Gonzalez is leaning toward supporting Mr. Biden, not least because he does not want the law to be completely wiped out. ""Maybe Obamacare is not perfect, but it's only a start,"" Mr. Gonzalez said in an interview this week. ""Trump is trying to terminate Obamacare, but he hasn't shown another plan. He does not inspire any confidence in me."" In North Carolina, one of the most hotly contested states in the presidential race, another undecided voter, Taft Turner, 59, of Greensboro, said the court vacancy made him more likely to choose Mr. Biden over a third-party candidate. He had already ruled out Mr. Trump and has been wavering on Mr. Biden, he said, in part because as a Black man he felt let down by both major parties. ""That seat concerns me a great deal,"" said Mr. Turner, a cancer survivor, adding of the possibility of the court overturning the law, ""What's important enough to gain by doing something that would harm so many people?""

Democrats are intent on using the A.C.A. to gain advantage in Senate races across the country, especially against vulnerable Republican incumbents like Thom Tillis in North Carolina, Martha McSally in Arizona and Cory Gardner in Colorado -- who has run an ad promising to protect pre-existing conditions even though he voted in 2017 to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Protect Our Care, a liberal advocacy group focused on preserving the health law, is preparing to run television ads in all three incumbents' states warning that they want ""to rush a justice onto the court who will repeal our health care,"" after digital ads this week. Similar ads are running against Republican senators in tighter-than-expected races in Alaska, Iowa, Georgia, Montana, South Carolina and Texas. Winning both the White House and the Senate, where Republicans currently hold a three-seat majority, could allow Democrats to fix the law in a way that might help save it from being overturned by the Supreme Court, by reinstating a financial penalty for people who go without health insurance. The crux of the legal case is that when Congress zeroed out the penalty in 2017, the law's requirement that most Americans have insurance became unconstitutional, and that without that mandate the rest of the law could not stand. The issue of the health law aside, Joel White, a Republican strategist, said he thought the court vacancy would actually help Republicans in tight Senate races ""where their base is looking for a reason to be excited,"" and in conservative states like Georgia and Montana, ""by motivating partisans."" More important, he said, the vacancy could galvanize evangelical voters who may otherwise have been reluctant to vote for Mr. Trump. James DiPaolo, an independent voter in Jacksonville, Fla., said he had been considering voting for Mr. Biden -- even though he dislikes the Affordable Care Act's requirement that insurance plans offer comprehensive coverage, which can make them more expensive -- because Mr. Trump ""says things that are atrocious."" But the court vacancy he said, has changed his calculation because he is a devout Catholic and ""big fan"" of Judge Barrett. ""Her being a woman of faith, that's important to me,"" Mr. DiPaolo, 36, said of Judge Barrett, who is also Catholic. Mr. DiPaolo did point to one piece of the health law that he strongly supports: its protections for people with pre-existing conditions. His grandfather had diabetes, as does his father, he said, adding, ""I'm hoping it skips me but I don't know, so I think protections for that are key."" He did not connect a vote for Mr. Trump with the possibility of losing those protections. ""I don't see him getting rid of that,"" he said.","The health law had slipped in voter priorities, but the Supreme Court vacancy and November arguments in a case challenging its constitutionality have given the Affordable Care Act new urgency.",48a64bd2-2f7c-561f-bcd0-4dde0e91e781,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/27/science/27ACA/27ACA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=4fe9c12e24aeb3619e80216e61dc54bc35e40212fc1828a5343a17e30cd209c9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Supporters of the Affordable Care Act outside the Supreme Court in 2015, after a ruling that upheld a major provision of the law.",48a64bd2-2f7c-561f-bcd0-4dde0e91e781,N24News/imgs/48a64bd2-2f7c-561f-bcd0-4dde0e91e781.jpg,1

Science,An Unlikely Driver of Evolution: Arsenic,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/13/science/an-unlikely-driver-of-evolution-arsenic.html,"Around 11,000 years ago, humans first set foot in the driest place on Earth. The Atacama Desert straddles the Andes Mountains, reaching into parts of Chile, Peru, Bolivia and Argentina. Little rain falls on the desert -- some spots haven't received a single drop in recorded history. But the people who arrived at the Atacama managed to turn it into a home. Some Atacamenos, as they are known today, fished the Pacific. Others hunted game and herded livestock in the highlands. They mummified their dead, decorating them with ceremonial wigs before leaving them in the mountains. Those mummies reveal a hidden threat in the Atacama. When scientists analyzed the hair in 7,000-year-old mummy wigs, they discovered high levels of arsenic. Through their lives, the Atacamenos were gradually poisoned. Arsenic can poison people today through exposure to pesticides and pollution. But arsenic is also naturally present in the water and soil in some parts of the world. The Atacama Desert, sitting on top of arsenic-rich volcanic rock, is one of them. The concentration of arsenic in Atacama drinking water can be 20 times higher than the level considered safe for human consumption.

Now a team of scientists has discovered that the arsenic of the Atacama Desert didn't just make people sick. It also spurred their evolution. In a new study in the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, researchers report that over the years the Atacamenos became more resistant to arsenic, thanks to natural selection. It is the first documented case of natural selection in humans for a defense against an environmental poison. Jonathan K. Pritchard, a geneticist at Stanford University who was not involved in the study, called the results ""convincing"" and a new addition to ""a very small number of known human selection signals."" The liver defends the body against arsenic by tacking on extra carbon and hydrogen atoms to the element. Those extra atoms make arsenic less toxic and easier to draw out of the bloodstream in the kidneys, so that it can be flushed out of the body with urine. In the late 1990s, researchers discovered that most Atacamenos detoxify arsenic at an unusually high rate. Recently a group of researchers in Sweden went searching for the genes that make the Atacamenos so unusual.

The scientists collected urine and blood from women in a village in Argentina called San Antonio de los Cobres. Levels of arsenic in their urine were used to determine how well each woman's body detoxified the poison. The scientists also sequenced over a million short segments of DNA in the women's genomes. They looked for genetic variants shared by the women able to rid themselves of arsenic most efficiently. These women all shared a distinctive stretch of DNA on chromosome 10, the scientists found. That stretch contains a gene called AS3MT, which encodes a liver enzyme that helps detoxify poisons. ""It's a confirmation that this gene is really, really important for arsenic excretion,"" said Mattias Jakobsson, a professor of genetics at Uppsala University and a co-author of the new study. Dr. Jakobsson and his colleagues then compared the DNA in people from San Antonio de los Cobres with DNA from people in Peru and Colombia who don't have to drink arsenic-laced water. For the most part, their DNA was nearly identical. There was only one major difference: the stretch of DNA that contains the AS3MT gene. About 70 percent of people in San Antonio de los Cobres have the variant that lets them resist arsenic. When people first arrived in the Atacama Desert, the scientists concluded, a few of them carried this mutation. Because there was no way to avoid ingesting arsenic, the mutation immediately became important to their survival. ""If you settle in this area and there is one stream, there aren't many options for getting water,"" said Karin Broberg, a geneticist at the Karolinska Institute and a co-author of the study.

The Atacamenos began to suffer from chronic arsenic poisoning, which can lead to cancer, skin lesions, and a weakening of the immune system in babies. The people who carried the protective mutation were able to detoxify the arsenic faster, perhaps by making extra copies of the AS3MT enzyme. ""It's not a magic cure,"" said Dr. Jakobsson. ""If you have the protective variant, you're not going to have a perfect life drinking a lot of arsenic. But the effects are probably smaller."" That difference meant that people with the mutation survived to have more children than people who lacked it. Over thousands of years, natural selection made it more common. Scientists have documented several cases in which humans have experienced strong natural selection over the past thousands of years. In some parts of Africa, some individuals evolved resistance to malaria. In northwestern Europe and elsewhere, natural selection favored genes that let adults digest milk. In Tibet, it favored genes for survival at high altitudes. The new study on the Atacamenos, by contrast, shows that toxic chemicals can also drive human evolution. Understanding how it happened may help guide public health measures to reduce the suffering caused by arsenic poisoning, which threatens an estimated 200 million people worldwide. And it can also help scientists understand how we detoxify chemicals like arsenic, a process that is still fairly mysterious. ""If you find a signal of natural selection, then you know this has been a huge issue for human survival in the past,"" Dr. Jakobsson said.","A new study suggests that people who live in the Atacama Desert are more resistant to arsenic than other people, thanks to natural selection.",4f02c005-6de8-5daf-9c91-cd721f218b0f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/13/science/13ZiMMER/13ZiMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=242aaa115621337c4b4c06149a6bbfb5fe4e571dc201894aa12bb9bf9a74bcb4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Andes near San Antonio de los Cobres, a village in Argentina where about 70 percent of villagers have a gene variant that lets them resist arsenic.",4f02c005-6de8-5daf-9c91-cd721f218b0f,N24News/imgs/4f02c005-6de8-5daf-9c91-cd721f218b0f.jpg,2
Fashion & Style,"Hey, Governor, What Are You Wearing?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/01/fashion/jb-pritzker-dress-advice.html,"The news that Anna Sorokin, the New York ""party girl grifter"" whose story has fascinated society and Hollywood and who is on trial in Manhattan Supreme Court, has been advised by a stylist on what to wear for her courtroom appearances should not really come as a surprise to anyone. Increasingly, it seems, there is a tendency to rely on experts to help navigate the thorny issues of what to wear when, and not just for highly fraught events. Consider, for example, the recent reports that J.B. Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, has daily notations on his official schedule related to dress. Or rather, how to dress for different occasions. This has gotten less attention than Ms. Sorokin's news has (he is, to be fair, a somewhat less sensationalist figure), but in many ways it is a similarly revealing sign of the times. According to John O'Connor of The Associated Press, who used the Freedom of Information Act to get access to the governor's schedule during the first six weeks of his term, there were more than 70 written recommendations regarding what the governor should wear to various planned events.

The advice included when to bring multiple tie choices (for his official photo; he went with marine blue with white polka dots), when to forget the tie altogether, as well as what occasions were best for the ""polo with Columbia jacket."" At first, like Mr. O'Connor, I thought this was unusual. Governor Pritzker, after all, has been a businessman and philanthropist, and presumably knows how to dress for the office. So I called Jordan Abudayyeh, Mr. Pritzker's press secretary, to ask why it was necessary. She said the notations were ""standard operating procedure"" meant to make his life simpler and make sure he always looked appropriate. She did not have much else to add. Which is too bad, because Mr. Pritzker and his team are indeed far from alone in this particular strategy, though they may be taking it to a slightly more extreme level than most. According to Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist and former aide to Mitt Romney during Mr. Romney's time as governor of Massachusetts and his two presidential campaigns, it was ""not unusual"" to jot down on the governor's schedule whether the dress code for an event was ""business, casual or black tie.""

During the campaigns, this could be even more detailed, depending on the event. (A country barbecue, for example, might require more thought.) Donna Brazile, the onetime interim head of the Democratic National Committee and a recently signed Fox News contributor, said that in her experience such advice came from communications and advance teams and was ""part of the message of the day."" Also, that it had become increasingly important and, perhaps, detailed.

""Once upon a time, you had three dress codes: business, casual and formal,"" she wrote in an email, noting that today candidates can dress to ""signal everything from leadership style to their political branding"" and hence need a certain amount of premeditation. Bennet Ratcliff , a former political consultant who worked with the Democratic Governors Association, pointed out that social media has exacerbated the situation. A politician is now dressing not just for the people in the room but also the people scrolling past a picture of said politician with the people in the room -- and may be stopping to look or think. In that context, you can go one of two ways: adopt an effective uniform that communicates an attitude of formality in representing the job (see, for example, President Trump, who rarely appears in public without a jacket, and seems happiest in his oversize suits and below-the-belt red ties); or dress to fit in with the group you are with. In which case maybe you need a bit of help determining what that means.

There is nothing wrong with this, or with thinking about this; it doesn't reveal a superficiality or lack of substance, which is often the default fear when the topic of clothing comes up. On the contrary, it acknowledges the truth that we all make snap judgments based first on appearance, and then make a choice about how much time and brain space need to be devoted to influencing those judgments, and how much can be delegated. This should be something everyone can relate to, given the current craziness around dress codes in general, be it the complete nonsense of events that request ""creative dress"" or ""dress to impress"" or the difficulty of corporate strictures on dressing ""appropriately"" in an office setting, a word so vague that it is practically meaningless. (Yes, Goldman Sachs, this means you.) To a certain extent, we are always in search of dress recommendations and instruction, as the social and professional codes of yesteryear have eroded under the increasing commingling of life and work, putting an end to unspoken uniforms. That's why stylists and personal shoppers have become such a booming business, increasingly famous in their own right. In many ways, politics has been the most insulated of all professions, but clearly, even that is changing.

Mr. O'Connor of The Associated Press said that after he discovered the dress notations on Mr. Pritzker's schedule, he asked to speak with the governor about the subject but to no avail (his email request received no response, which was, he said, a rarity in his experience). Frankly, I think Governor Pritzker missed a great opportunity. He would have done everyone a favor if, once the topic was on the table, he had embraced it. Imagine how liberating it would be if a politician, especially a male one, was secure enough to give an interview about the importance of dressing the part, and how useful it was to have someone thinking about that so he could use his time crafting policy, be it for flood management or health care? Especially because the question of public figures and what they wear and who helps decide that is bound to become more fraught during the coming Democratic primary, as the pressure to distinguish oneself will put more onus on crafting an identifiable image that stands apart while simultaneously standing for something. Arguably Beto O'Rourke has already proven himself to be working this angle, at least judging by his Vanity Fair cover and his skill at casting himself as the people's pol.

Theater,Review: Could a Long-Gone Antarctic Explorer Be Mr. Right?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/08/theater/review-could-a-long-gone-antarctic-explorer-be-mr-right.html,"Roald Amundsen? Not exactly a babe. Robert Falcon Scott? Bedroom eyes, yes, but he ate his own ponies. Robert E. Peary suffered from an excess of mustache. And can you really picture yourself canoodling with James Clark Ross's mutton chops? So when it comes to polar explorers, you can see why a woman might fall for Ernest Shackleton, the Antarctic trekker who rescued his crew when their ship splintered. Though dead nearly a century, he's the heartthrob in the slim, spunky new musical ""Ernest Shackleton Loves Me,"" with music by Brendan Milburn, lyrics by Val Vigoda and a book by Joe DiPietro (""Memphis,"" ""I Love You, You're Perfect, Now Change""). Ms. Vigoda stars as Kat, a floundering composer and foundering mother to a crying baby in a freezing Brooklyn apartment. Deserted by the baby's daddy and loopy from lack of sleep, she posts an ad on a dating site, Cupid's Leftovers. Her first response: a phone call from an entranced Shackleton, whose husky voice sounds through the wires. Then his wind-chilled body (courtesy of the actor Wade McCollum) enters through Kat's Frigidaire.

Ms. Vigoda and Mr. Milburn, a formerly married pair who play in the band GrooveLily, are frequent musical-theater collaborators. Their works, like ""Striking 12"" and ""Long Story Short,"" mix the snarky and the sentimental. Under Lisa Peterson's focused direction, ""Ernest Shackleton"" is no exception. Though Ms. Vigoda plays a cool Kat, she quickly warms to Shackleton's bearded confidence and to the hortatory message of most of the songs: ""Keep sailing on,"" ""Don't you let your heart sink down,"" ""Be the calm in the eye of the storm."" There's something at least a little strange about using Shackleton's superhuman exploits to persuade a woman to get over her ex. But hey, whatever floats your lifeboat. Mr. McCollum has a bluff, genial presence, which plays nicely against Ms. Vigoda's spikier feel and punk-rock styling. (Mr. McCollum also plays a couple of other men in Kat's life -- her unsupportive employer, her flaky ex.) If there's not much romantic chemistry between them, it's amusing to watch them sledge and sail and climb across Alexander V. Nichols's multilevel stage. Video, much of it adapted from actual footage recorded during Shackleton's expedition, further sets the scene.

The songs get a lift from Ms. Vigoda's live looping and electric violin playing, with bowing that can resemble a lover's caress or a tree surgeon's cut saw. While many of her rhymes are merely serviceable, plenty are more distinctive, like ""riches"" and ""bewitches,"" ""obscurity"" and ""security,"" ""splendor"" and ""surrender,"" even ""freakin'"" and ""beacon."" But with the exception of a cheerily disjointed opening number, the score and the narrative that encases it are too tidy to allow for much real feeling. Kat is supposedly an experimental composer, but most of the music is merry pastiche -- sea chantey, pop ballad. If Mr. DiPietro's premise is nicely weird, his psychology and story rarely buck convention. I kept expecting the tale to go dark -- I'd confused Shackleton's story with Scott's -- but there's little frostbite here. The result plays a bit like a self-help audiobook, with songs and hallucinations. Somewhere in ""Ernest Shackleton Loves Me"" there's a more serious-minded questioning of relationships. Are security and the occasional drugstore bouquet enough, or should a singleton look for a partner who encourages her to be her bravest, most capable, most creative self? Kat finds her answer with the help of a supernatural assist. But let's hope most people don't have to sail to the Antarctic and shoot their sled dogs to figure it out.",'Ernest Shackleton Loves Me' raises a trekker from the dead as a heartthrob in this spunky new musical.,89a02404-befb-5e99-8859-787fd8bd2e47,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/09/arts/09ERNEST1/09ERNEST1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e15ed0a3f6d3652ec8f895eab47e84394b5f3ea97a44b1cd223090bff5a39f0f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Wade McCollum, left, and Val Vigoda climb across Alexander V.

Dance,Five Dancers Accuse City Ballet's Peter Martins of Physical Abuse,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/arts/dance/peter-martins-ballet-new-york-city-physical-abuse.html,"In 1993, Jeffrey Edwards was a soloist with New York City Ballet when he did something radical, at least for the company: He accused Peter Martins, the powerful ballet master in chief, of verbal and physical abuse, and reported him. ""I brought a complaint to the general manager, company manager and the dancers' union, describing Peter's conduct in detail,"" Mr. Edwards said in a recent statement to The New York Times. The union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, confirmed that it had received the complaint. But to all appearances, nothing much happened. Mr. Martins continued in his role as leader of City Ballet and the School of American Ballet, and Mr. Edwards left the company shortly thereafter. The next year, Victor Ostrovsky, a 12-year-old student at the ballet school, had his own run-in with Mr. Martins. During a dress rehearsal, Mr. Ostrovsky said he was horsing around onstage with other children when Mr. Martins became enraged and grabbed him by the back of the neck in what Mr. Ostrovsky called ""a death lock.""

""He's yanking me around to the left and to the right, he's digging his left thumb and his middle finger -- I felt like he was piercing my muscle,"" Mr. Ostrovsky said in a telephone interview. ""I started crying and sobbing profusely."" He dropped out of the school. ""I was depressed; I was embarrassed,"" he said. ""He assaulted me onstage in front of the whole cast."" Mr. Edwards and Mr. Ostrovsky are two of five City Ballet dancers -- one of whom still works with the company -- who in recent interviews accused Mr. Martins of threatening or physically abusing them and others in the company. Their descriptions of his behavior -- from raising his fist to physical altercations -- could be another problem for Mr. Martins, who has taken a leave as the leader of City Ballet and the School of American Ballet while they investigate a sexual harassment claim against him. Mr. Martins has long been known to have intimate relationships with dancers, as well as a quick, volcanic temper. That he was able to act so freely, his critics say, points to dysfunctional power relationships between Mr. Martins and his employees, and between him and City Ballet's management, which at times seems to have looked the other way. After incidents with Mr. Edwards and another dancer, Kelly Boal -- who recently described her encounter to The Washington Post -- some dancers suggested adding an ""abuse clause"" to their contract. Lindsay Fischer, a former City Ballet dancer who was head of the union committee at the time, said the clause -- which had originally been proposed in response to a racist incident at the Houston Ballet -- was ultimately voted down. ""In the end, we left the contract the way it was,"" said Mr. Fischer, now principal balletmaster, at the National Ballet of Canada. ""Our opinion was we were already protected by ordinary law, not to mention human decency.""

Stephen E. Tisman, a lawyer for Mr. Martins, said: ""While the investigation is going on, Peter is not going to be commenting publicly on allegations."" City Ballet and the school also said they were unable to comment, citing the investigation. Mr. Martins is an outsize figure in the dance world, controlling virtually every aspect of City Ballet -- from choreography to casting -- and making it nearly impossible for dancers to speak up without professional consequences. Alina Dronova, a dancer in the corps de ballet for 17 years, said Mr. Martins was routinely allowed to be aggressive. ""He would grab me by my neck and kick me out of his office,"" she said. ""He would do that to almost everyone."" For dancers to succeed, it sometimes seemed as if physical intimidation had to be endured. ""I have the visual of him standing over me with a fist clenched two weeks before he promoted me,"" said a current member of the company who asking for anonymity out of fear of repercussions. John Clifford, a principal dancer and choreographer under George Balanchine, recalled teaching a City Ballet class in 1987 when Mr. Martins grew angry with him. ""He slammed his fists into the wall about an inch from my head,"" Mr. Clifford said. ""It was a violent, intimidating act, and it scared me. ""He just blew up,"" Mr. Clifford continued, adding that Mr. Martins never asked him back. Mr. Clifford is also one of two former dancers who said they witnessed Mr. Martins get violent with Heather Watts, a former principal dancer with the company who had a yearslong stormy romantic relationship with Mr. Martins.

""I saw him pick her up and slam her into a cement wall,"" Mr. Clifford recalled. ""I was outside his dressing room."" (Ms. Watts declined to comment.) ""I want to make sure these girls who are reporting this are taken seriously,"" added Mr. Clifford, the founding artistic director of Los Angeles Dance Theater. ""It's not gossip, it's fact. It's something I saw with my own eyes."" In 1992, Mr. Martins was charged with third-degree assault against his wife, Darci Kistler, then a principal in the company. Ms. Kistler told the police that her arms and legs had been cut and bruised. The misdemeanor charge was later dropped. Several of the interviewed dancers expressed surprise that City Ballet had kept Mr. Martins on after that incident. Over the weekend, City Ballet appointed an interim team of City Ballet dancers to lead the company during Mr. Martins's absence, the duration of which has not been specified. The team was introduced to the company at a Saturday meeting of City Ballet's dancers, Katherine Brown the executive director, and two trustees: Charles W. Scharf, the chairman, and Robert I. Lipp, the vice chairman. At the meeting, Mr. Lipp expressed hope that Mr. Martins could soon ""be back and continuing in his regular role."" ""I know it's not business as usual,"" he added. ""We're going to do the right thing, whatever that turns out to be.""","The accusations, spanning decades, come after a sexual harassment claim against Mr. Martins.",2b5f5d92-37fd-5faa-a99d-1326991089f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/02/arts/danceJMP/dance-inquiry1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c471b13d32666fd0b15119fef3cb06f1688b39676be41bbcc949cfe69188cb5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Peter Martins with dancers from the New York City Ballet.,2b5f5d92-37fd-5faa-a99d-1326991089f3,N24News/imgs/2b5f5d92-37fd-5faa-a99d-1326991089f3.jpg,6
Science,'Knitting Is Coding' and Yarn Is Programmable in This Physics Lab,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/science/math-physics-knitting-matsumoto.html,"Elisabetta Matsumoto holds a Geared Cuboctahedral Jitterbug that she designed with mathematician Henry Segerman.Credit...Johnathon Kelso for The New York Times

'Knitting Is Coding' and Yarn Is Programmable in This Physics Lab

BOSTON -- On the eve of the American Physical Society's annual March meeting, a Sunday ""stitch 'n bitch"" session convened during happy hour at a lobby bar of the Westin Boston Waterfront hotel. Karen Daniels, a physicist at North Carolina State University, had tweeted notice of the meet-up earlier that day: ""Are you a physicist into knitting, crocheting, or other fiber arts?"" she asked. ""I'll be the one knitting a torus."" (A torus is a mathematized doughnut; hers was inspired by a figure in a friend's scientific paper.) At the bar, amid tables cluttered with balls of yarn, Dr. Daniels absorbed design advice from a group of specialized knitters, among them Elisabetta Matsumoto, an applied mathematician and physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology and a co-host of the gathering. For Dr. Matsumoto, knitting is more than a handicraft hobby with health benefits. She is embarking on a five-year project, ""What a Tangled Web We Weave,"" funded by the National Science Foundation, to investigate the mathematics and mechanics of ""the ancient technology known as knitting.""

Dr. Matsumoto argues that ""knitting is coding"" and that yarn is a programmable material. The potential dividends of her research range from wearable electronics to tissue scaffolding. During the happy-hour meetup, she knitted a swatch illustrating a plastic surgery technique called Z-plasty. The swatch was for a talk she would deliver at 8 a.m. on Wednesday morning called ""Twisted Topological Tangles."" Scores of physicists turned up, despite a competing parallel session on ""The Extreme Mechanics of Balloons."" ""I've been knitting since I was a kid,"" Dr. Matsumoto told her (mostly male) audience. ""That was the thing I did to get along with my mom when I was a teenager. It's just been a dream to take all of this stuff that I learned and played with as a child and turn it into something scientifically rigorous.""

As a first step, her team is enumerating all possible knittable stitches: ""There's going to be a countably infinite number. How to classify them is what we are working on now."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The investigation is informed by the mathematical tradition of knot theory. A knot is a tangled circle -- a circle embedded with crossings that cannot be untangled. (A circle with no crossings is an ""unknot."") ""The knitted stitch is a whole series of slipknots, one after the other,"" said Dr. Matsumoto. Rows and columns of slipknots form a lattice pattern so regular that it is analogous to crystal structure and crystalline materials. By way of knot theory, Dr. Matsumoto essentially is developing a knit theory: an alphabet of unit-cell stitches, a glossary of stitch combinations, and a grammar governing the knitted geometry and topology -- the fabric's stretchiness, or its ""emergent elasticity."" How 'floofy' is it?

""Just based on these two stitches, these two fundamental units, we can make a whole series of fabrics, and each of these fabrics has remarkably different elastic properties,"" Dr. Matsumoto told the audience. She first combined her math-y and woolly mind-sets as a Ph.D. student, after admiring a friend's crocheted interpretation of the hyperbolic plane (curly kale is a vegetable example) and wondering how to do it differently. ""It irritated me that it wasn't isotropic,"" she recalled on the day before her talk. She could see where the crochet had begun, whereas a true hyperbolic plane should betray no starting point and no direction.

Knitting away for two months, Dr. Matsumoto encountered one stitch in the dragon's beard that she had never seen before. ""In the pattern for the dragon, there are all these crazy stitches,"" she said -- stitches that took up not just a single cell on the pattern grid, but stretched across numerous cells, seeming to follow a horizontal array rather than the usual, vertical orientation. Her team's knit theory will incorporate these and other stitch morphologies, as well as intentional stitch defects and constraints, such as how a yarn bends, twists and compresses; how many plies it has, how thick it is, and how ""floofy."" Floofiness refers to a yarn's ""halo area, where ephemeral fuzzy fibers stick out,"" Dr. Matsumoto said, and it changes the way two pieces of yarn interact with each other, their friction and energy exchange. ""I'd love to write a paper using the word 'floofy' as a technical term.""

During his introductory remarks, Dr. Reis had a vexing encounter with an intertwined microphone cord. ""This is a good example of why we really care about this topic,"" he said. Dr. Reis grapples with the likes of long-overhand shoelace knotting, climbing knots, basket weaving, surgical sutures, and how to pass on the art of surgical-knot craftsmanship to robots. During the session, his lab mates described how they had used a CT scan to probe the internal structure of knot filaments and the friction that arises where filaments touch. After the meeting, Dr. Matsumoto sent him home with some of her swatches. Derek Moulton, of the University of Oxford, mentioned variants of sailor's knots, DNA and protein knots, and worms that tie themselves into knots in order to minimize dehydration. He went on discuss ""whether a knotted filament with zero points of self-contact may be realized physically."" That is, can a knot exist wherein none of its crossings touch? (It can; try it at home with a strip of paper, or a cord.) And Thomas Plumb-Reyes, an applied physicist at Harvard, presented his research on ""Detangling Hair"" to a standing-room-only audience. ""What is going on in tangled hair?"" he asked. ""What is the optimal combing strategy?"" Shashank Markande, a Ph.D. student working with Dr. Matsumoto, reported on their stitch classification work so far. Together, they had derived a conjecture: All knittable stitches must be ribbon knots. (A ribbon knot is a very technical tangle.) And they pondered the corollary: Are all ribbon knots knittable? Back in February, Mr. Markande (who started knitting only recently for the sake of science) thought he'd found an example of an unknittable ribbon knot, using a knots-and-links software program called SnapPy. He sent Dr. Matsumoto a text message with a sketch: ""Tell me if this can be knitted?"" Dr. Matsumoto was just heading out for a run, and by the time she returned, having manipulated the yarn every which way in her head, she had worked out an answer. ""I think that can be knitted,"" she texted back. When Mr. Markande pressed her on how, she added: ""It's knittable by our rules, but it isn't trivial to do with needles.""

For the Tangled Web project, most of the experimental knitting is produced by a replica of a vintage 1970s knitting machine, the Taitexma Industrial and Home-Based Knitting Machine Model TH-860, which is operated by Krishma Singal, a doctoral student. The machine can also be programmed by punched cards -- as was the Jacquard loom, invented in 1804 by Joseph Marie Jacquard and sometimes called the first digital technology. Dr. Matsumoto's team likes to contemplate how stitch patterns provide code -- more complex code than the 1s and 0s of binary -- that creates the program for the elasticity and geometry of knitted fabric. The buzzword is ""topological programmable materials,"" said postdoc Michael Dimitriyev. He is working on a computer simulation of knitted fabric, inputting yarn properties and stitch topology, and outputting the geometry and elasticity of the real-life finished object. ""I'm the killjoy that brings in elasticity,"" he likes to say. The team's first paper, currently underway, will verify Dr. Dimitriyev's simulations against Ms. Singal's hard-copy swatches. Once the computer simulation is refined, Dr. Matsumoto and her collaborators can pull out equations and algorithms for knitted fabric behavior, which in turn could be put into physics engines for computer game graphics, or movies.","For Elisabetta Matsumoto, knot theory is knit theory.",fa8b2133-a916-5d6f-a70a-650f54a6e9a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/21/science/00SCI-KNITTING-10/00SCI-KNITTING-10-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f78bc27495703efaecb7c95acc64e6619a1e4b0fecb488c90d39b4cd8ee4c10c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Elisabetta Matsumoto, center, with the graduate students Krishma Singal, left, and Danielle Skinner, is a physicist at the Georgia Institute of Technology, embarking on a five-year study of the mathematics and mechanics of knitting.",fa8b2133-a916-5d6f-a70a-650f54a6e9a9,N24News/imgs/fa8b2133-a916-5d6f-a70a-650f54a6e9a9.jpg,2
Opinion,How a Persian Mystic Poet Changed My Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/26/opinion/rumi-poems.html,"My manic, psychotic break from the rest of the world's notion of reality was clinical and terrifying, but it started out soulful and electrifying. For a brief moment before the hallucinations, delusions, restraints, seclusion and hospitalization that ensued, an intense calm washed over me. Standing on my Atlanta balcony watching the sun rise over Stone Mountain, I felt a deep connection to every atom back to Adam and before, and to the divine spirit within each one of those atoms. However clumsily, I had stumbled into the land of mystics, the land of my father, the land of Rumi.

At long last, I was beginning to understand this poetry that had spoken to my father since he was a child in Shiraz. For what modern medicine lacked by way of explanation, Rumi provided through my father's voice, visiting me on the locked psychiatric unit of the same hospital where he had performed thousands of surgeries and delivered hundreds of babies:

In love with insanity, I'm fed up with wisdom and rationality.

While Rumi considers insanity a mark of divine favor, he distinguishes between types. The madness he promotes is rooted in ecstatic love; the one he condemns, in petty fear. The former creates a mystic, the latter a lunatic.

When I first began studying Rumi with my father in late 2014, years after that psychiatric hospitalization, properly diagnosed and medicated for bipolar disorder and in recovery, I never expected that within a few short years my extended family in Iran would be barred from visiting us in the United States. Nor did I ever expect that our country would become so deeply divided.

But here we are, more isolated than ever, and as an Iranian-American Muslim feminist living with a mental health condition, I feel the weight of this isolation every day. Heavy with fear's warped wisdom and rationality, crazier than anything mania ever induced in me, this weight is a reminder that clinical psychosis, even absent any mystical tendency, seems sensible compared with our current political reality. Thankfully, as a student of my father and Rumi, I have learned how to counter the toll of this weight. In Rumi's words:

Become the sky and the clouds that create the rain, not the gutter that carries it to the drain.

Of course it's easier to be the gutter than the sky, to imitate rather than to create, but imitation builds cults, not communities. It may seem counterintuitive, but true community demands originality, not conformity. I know this firsthand, because every time I write something new it helps me feel less alone, reminding me that we are all inextricably linked to and through a sacred spark within each of us.

It seems so obvious, but it's also painfully easy to forget how deeply connected we are. More than any other factor, it's ego that makes us forget, filling us with a sense of superiority. This false feeling of being somehow ""better than"" our fellow human beings allows us to forget the common source of our humanity and thus to disconnect from the divinity within ourselves and one another. This is why, for Rumi, ego is not only the worst of our natural and inescapable human afflictions but also the root of them all. His solution?",My father recited Rumi to me as I grew up. I finally chose to listen.,23047abe-5a2b-5c4f-8b37-d7bf81a1d40f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/26/opinion/26Moezzi/26Moezzi-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ce7f45ca142de53d581a63affc5a411624c97964da129bbc2a7d60a94fde8b5c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Portrait of the 13th-century Persian poet and mystic Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi.,23047abe-5a2b-5c4f-8b37-d7bf81a1d40f,N24News/imgs/23047abe-5a2b-5c4f-8b37-d7bf81a1d40f.jpg,11
Science,"Coffee Beans Are Good for Birds, Fancy Brew or Not",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/16/science/coffee-birds-biodiversity.html,"Birds are not as picky about their coffee as people are.

Although coffee snobs prefer arabica beans to robusta, a new study in India found that growing coffee does not interfere with biodiversity -- no matter which bean the farmer chooses.

In the Western Ghats region of India, a mountainous area parallel to the subcontinent's western coast, both arabica and robusta beans are grown as bushes under larger trees -- unlike in South America, where the coffee plants themselves grow as large as trees, said Krithi Karanth, who helped lead the study, published Friday in the journal Scientific Reports.

India is the seventh-largest producer of coffee in the world, according to the International Coffee Organization, an intergovernmental organization. Most of the coffee grown in India is consumed there, said Dr. Karanth, an associate conservation scientist with the Wildlife Conservation Society, but the findings of her research could have implications for shade-grown coffee in other parts of the world.","A study of India's Western Ghats region found that growing coffee doesn't interfere with biodiversity, regardless of which bean the farmer chooses.",f3073e8b-09ee-534d-96d9-937636feef8d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/17/science/17TB-COFFEE6/17TB-COFFEE6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=08d7d5791b5a740982fc80b504ed371f2131055740166c2570c02db4855f0109&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Malabar pied hornbill, one of 204 species of bird found on coffee plantations in a new study, which found that the tree cover from shade-grown coffee farms provides a welcome habitat for all kinds of animal species.",f3073e8b-09ee-534d-96d9-937636feef8d,N24News/imgs/f3073e8b-09ee-534d-96d9-937636feef8d.jpg,2
Opinion,Just Because You Can Afford to Leave the City Doesn't Mean You Should,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/15/opinion/sunday/coronavirus-cities-density.html,"Just Because You Can Afford to Leave the City Doesn't Mean You Should

The image of cities as caldrons of contagion is a very old one. In the 19th century, rapid urbanization was accompanied by literal squalor and waves of often lethal communicable disease. Life expectancy declined during the Industrial Revolution as cities' populations surged. But in recent years, U.S. cities could boast that the so-called urban penalty had been reversed. ""If you want to live longer and healthier than the average American, then come to New York City,"" Mayor Michael Bloomberg declared. This advantage continued with his successor, Bill de Blasio. New York had an average life expectancy roughly 2.5 years longer than the nation's in 2017, the most recent year for which data are available. This is good news, since most of humanity lives in cities, and in the United States, over half of the population lives in a metro area.

Connecting the dots between population density and viral transmission seems simple logic. New York, with a population of 8.6 million, is the only American megacity. It is also the U.S. center of the pandemic. But everything we know so far about the coronavirus tells us that blaming density for disease is misguided. New York City Health Department data indicate that Manhattan, the borough with the highest population density, was not the hardest hit. Deaths are concentrated in the less dense, more diverse other boroughs. Citywide, black and Latino residents are experiencing mortality rates that are twice those of white city dwellers. Then there is the rest of the world. While the coronavirus first exploded in Wuhan, a city of 11 million, many ""hyperdense"" cities in Asia have been able to contain their outbreaks. The virus appeared in Singapore (5.6 million residents), Seoul (9.8 million), Hong Kong (7.5 million) and Tokyo (9.3 million), cities close in size to New York, but with much lower recorded deaths.

Cities, large and dense by definition, do not inevitably support explosive viral transmission. But factors that do seem to explain clusters of Covid-19 deaths in the United States are household crowding, poverty, racialized economic segregation and participation in the work force. The patterns of Covid-19 by neighborhood in New York City track historical redlining that some 80 years ago established a legacy of racial residential segregation. Population density is not the same as household overcrowding. The U.S. census defines crowding as more than one person per room, excluding the kitchen and bathroom. That means a one-bedroom apartment occupied by four people is crowded. In 2013, the Bronx had New York City's highest percentage of crowded households (12.4 percent), followed by Brooklyn (10.3 percent) and Queens (9.3 percent). Manhattan and Staten Island had 5.4 percent and 3.4 percent crowding. (Nationally, 2 percent of people live in crowded households.) More from ""The America We Need"" Why are there so many crowded households in New York, including in its less densely populated neighborhoods? The answer is simple: the high cost of housing. High rents are also a principal driver of homelessness, which during this epidemic has proved deadly. Covid-19 has shown how risky crowded settings like homeless shelters, jails, detention centers and nursing homes can be. It is no surprise that public health and urban planning have common roots and missions, because the quality and availability of housing, public transportation and green spaces are so tied to health. But as we think about the blueprint and design of cities, it is also critically important to consider the lived experience of individuals and how they navigate their urban space. Imagine a low-wage worker, who holds two jobs to support her family and pay the rent, who has to work during this pandemic because her job is ""essential,"" who works when sick because she has no sick leave. She travels on a crowded bus, puts off medical care because she lacks insurance, and then returns to an apartment crammed with young children and elderly family members. Maybe she fills in on the night shift as an aide at a nursing home.

This all conspires to make her especially vulnerable to the coronavirus -- with the result that her household, her nursing home and her neighbors all are liable to become sick as well. In this scenario, ""the city"" is not to blame for the explosion in cases of Covid-19. That disease is devastating cities like New York because of the structure of health care, the housing market and the labor market, not because of their density. The spread of the coronavirus didn't require cities -- we have also seen small towns ravaged. Rather, cities were merely the front door, the first stop. It's not that there are too many people in cities. It's that too many of their residents are poor, and many of them are members of the especially vulnerable black, Latino and Asian populations. That's what underlies the erroneous idea that, for those who can, it might be best to get far away from those people who endure household crowding and its risks. It's wrong for the ""haves"" to seek remote, isolated housing for at least two reasons. First, Covid-19 will be with us for some time. It has reached all 50 states and the District of Columbia. It has reached the White House. It sped to virtually every country in a few short months. It could just as well make inroads in the vacation communities and remote outposts where the wealthy have sought refuge. Next, when the affluent seek separate communities, it is not good for democracy or, in the long run, society's stability. The way to ensure both is instead to invest in affordable housing and safer workplaces. There are lessons from history. In the 19th century, recurring epidemics were tackled with public health measures, improved sanitation, building standards, and the introduction of sidewalks and parks. These investments made possible cities that could be optimal places for living. The walkability of urban areas builds exercise into everyday life, improving physical and mental health. The large numbers of people means a tax base that can support cultural institutions, world-class medical care, public transport and parks. Denser living is more efficient, less wasteful and kinder to the environment. It makes possible the interactions of all types of people, across the many divides of our society.",It's a mistake to blame density for the spread of the coronavirus.,54975fe5-e919-52b9-b4b9-b286357dd044,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/18/opinion/15bassWeb/15bassWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1a75b6a2b1c94f3682f71793c8af03eb799531c78b9755088529eae0a6c63aef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The idea that cities are inherently unhealthy has re-emerged during the coronavirus outbreak.,54975fe5-e919-52b9-b4b9-b286357dd044,N24News/imgs/54975fe5-e919-52b9-b4b9-b286357dd044.jpg,11
Sports,When Coronavirus Turns Every Sports Channel Into ESPN Classic,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/sports/sports-television-coronavirus.html,"This was supposed to be a good sports weekend. A great sports weekend. One of the best of the year. College basketball conference championship games and the revealing of the men's N.C.A.A. tournament bracket -- the unofficial start of March Madness. The final rounds of golf's fifth major. A boxing title fight. The home debut of Inter Miami, David Beckham's M.L.S. team. N.B.A. and N.H.L. games with playoff implications. A full Premier League slate.

Instead, with the near-worldwide cancellation of games because of the coronavirus, the present and immediate future are sports-free. Which is especially troublesome for the few dozen sports-only cable channels. On Friday, the day after a parade of sports leagues announced suspensions or cancellations of their seasons, no sports programs were among the 50 most watched on cable, according to ShowBuzzDaily. The week before, sports programs made up 10 of the top 50, and seven of the top 15.

ESPN has nine domestic cable channels, plus a streaming service, so it has over 200 hours of programming each day built specifically around a live sports calendar that no longer exists. ""Our programming team is hard at work to fill the holes on our networks, and we will provide updates when finalized,"" an ESPN communications executive wrote in an email announcing Saturday's significant program changes. ESPN has been sending out new schedules a day ahead of time. That seems about as far out as it is possible to plan for a reality that changes each day, each minute.

With little time to plan alternative programming -- or even to update some channel guides -- most sports networks are opting for older versions of their originally scheduled programming, borrowing the strategy endemic to ESPN Classic. CBS ran the Big Ten men's basketball conference championship games from 2018 and 2019 this weekend. NBCSN showed a Premier League match from earlier this season. Fox played the movie ""Whiskey Tango Foxtrot"" instead of an M.L.S. match. Fox Sports has canceled all of its studio shows through next week. ""SportsCenter"" has gained prominence in ESPN's lineup. Sports documentaries, like those from ESPN's ""30 for 30"" series, are in heavy rotation.

They are not live sports, but at least they aren't rerun sports. The strength of live sports on television is in the very name: They are live. They are appointment viewing. They cannot be missed.
* None
* Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. In a DVR and streaming world, sports are practically the only thing that needs to be viewed on a specific channel at a specific time. If a network has enough live sports media rights, cable companies are all but forced to carry it -- and to pay a hefty monthly fee for the privilege of offering the games to their customers -- and advertisers have to pay large sums of money to reach the vast audience of sports fans. Live sports are the star of the show, and the surrounding programming is just window dressing.

Regional sports networks, which show the vast majority of N.B.A., M.L.B. and N.H.L. games in the United States, take this to the extreme. Most barely bother to offer compelling daytime programming. The networks know they are indispensable because of the three hours each night they show your favorite team's game -- why run up costs during the other 21 hours of the day? Even at ESPN, FS1, NBCSN and other networks that try -- with varying degrees of success -- to persuade viewers to watch programming that isn't live action, people generally understand the reality. ""The majority of the costs, the majority of the ratings, and the majority of the revenue is always going to be from the games,"" Brian Windhorst, an ESPN analyst who appears on a number of the company's shows, told me two years ago. ""If we could put games on 24/7, there wouldn't even be us."" Then came the sobering kicker. ""We're just filling times between the games,"" he said. So what happens when the sports are all filler and reruns?

The second a game ends, its value drops precipitously. As programming, live sports aren't the brand-new car that loses 10 percent of its value the second it is driven off the lot. Live sports are the brand-new car that gets totaled by a speeding semi-truck the second it is driven off the lot. In other words, nobody wants to watch sports when they already know the outcome. Scripted programming, on the other hand, is still watchable -- and therefore valuable -- years or even decades later. Streaming services pay around $85 million annually to show the sitcom ""Friends"" and $100 million annually to show ""The Office."" ""Friends"" went off the air 16 years ago, and ""The Office"" ended in 2013. People will watch these shows years later, and then rewatch them and rewatch them. What makes sports so enthralling -- the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, to steal a phrase from ABC's ""Wide World of Sports"" -- is the same thing that makes sports channels so useless right now. ""Sports is really good in the moment,"" Reed Hastings, the chief executive of Netflix, said a few years ago. ""So you want to watch the game, but the afterlife of a given show is quite small."" Almost alone among sports leagues, Ultimate Fighting Championship opted not to cancel its competition this weekend in Brazil, but to instead hold fights without fans in attendance. Dana White, the U.F.C. president, said he went forward after consulting with the White House. Whether or not this was just risky, or highly irresponsible, remains to be seen. But for the sports fan, it was manna from heaven: Something live. The fighters dispensed with hamming up their entrances. The ring announcer bellowed their names into a cavernous nothingness. Grunts and punches were clearly audible. Yet when Charles Oliveira guillotined Kevin Lee to end the main event, I felt the familiar thrill of experiencing the unexpected for the only time all weekend. ESPN's ""Bottom Line,"" that comforting scroll of data, transactional news and the churning of the sports world all around me, had changed.

There was news about a few college basketball players who were entering the transfer portal, and of Rick Pitino's hiring by Iona. But mostly the scroll was an inescapable reminder of the enormous challenge in the weeks and months ahead for the world: Rudy Gobert donating $500,000 to coronavirus relief. Donovan Mitchell in isolation, feeling fine. Trevor Bauer speaking about virus stoppage. Teams assisting arena workers during the hiatus. Japan's prime minister: Olympics on as planned. Unidentified Seattle player has coronavirus. Baseball, Pro Football Halls of Fame close.","Replays of games that already happened. Documentaries that you might have missed.

Theater,Review: 'Sweat' Imagines the Local Bar as a Caldron,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/26/theater/sweat-review-broadway.html,"The bar that is the principal location for ""Sweat,"" Lynn Nottage's bracingly topical portrait of American dreams deferred in working-class Pennsylvania, is a place where friendships go to die. Sure, it looks awfully cozy and welcoming, and you can see why its denizens regard it as a second home. But this much-trafficked watering hole also exerts a dangerous gravitational force, the kind that holds people in place when they should be moving on. In ""Sweat,"" which opened on Sunday night at Studio 54, the feeling of familiarity that pervades the play's central setting gradually shades into contempt among those who drink there -- for themselves, for one another and for the life they cannot escape. As bars often are in old-fashioned and socially conscious dramas like ""Sweat,"" this one is a microcosm for a larger world. That includes not only Reading, Pa., the steel town where the play is set, but also a beleaguered part of the United States in which jobs are under siege and identity is fraying. It is foolish to underestimate the anger in places like these, as the most recent presidential election confirmed. Though it takes place in 2000 and 2008, and one of its characters swears he will never vote again, ""Sweat"" is the first work from a major American playwright to summon, with empathy and without judgment, the nationwide anxiety that helped put Donald J. Trump in the White House.

Those traits are definitely on display in ""Sweat,"" which is directed by Kate Whoriskey and features a sturdy nine-member ensemble. Ms. Nottage did intensive research for this play, and it shows, perhaps more than it should. Though it is steeped in social combustibility, ""Sweat"" often feels too conscientiously assembled, a point-counterpoint presentation in which every disaffected voice is allowed its how-I-got-this-way monologue. And this thoughtful, careful play only seldom acquires the distance-erasing passion of Ms. Nottage's ""Ruined,"" the 2009 Pulitzer Prize winner about female casualties of the Congolese civil war. The play is set both on the eve and in the twilight of George W. Bush's presidency. It begins in 2008 -- in scenes that switch between a parole officer's interrogations of two young men recently released from prison -- and flashes back to 2000, to follow the road to the crime for which they were incarcerated.

The parolees are Jason (Will Pullen) and Chris (Khris Davis), and they were once the closest of friends. So were Jason's mother, Tracey (Johanna Day), and Chris's mother, Cynthia (Michelle Wilson). With the hard-drinking Jessie (Alison Wright), these women form a triumvirate that gathers regularly at their hangout to celebrate one another's birthdays and swap workplace gossip and grievances. (The unobtrusively on-target set is by John Lee Beatty, with costumes in the same vein by Jennifer Moeller.) Mothers, sons and Jessie work for the town's venerable steel tubing factory. So did Stan (James Colby), the bartender, but he lost his job after a leg-maiming accident. Everyone complains about the factory, but the work it has provided for generations of Reading residents shapes the rhyme and reason of their shared world.

There are rumors of imminent layoffs, though, which grow louder during the scenes set in 2000, along with speculation that the entire plant might relocate to Mexico. (The Nafta treaty is invoked with four-letter opprobrium.) Such talk brings out Darwinian survival instincts, especially once Cynthia gets a job in management at the factory. Aspirations to another life may be common among these people, but such hopes are widely resented when they show signs of becoming reality. That Cynthia is black and Tracey and Jessie are white becomes an issue in a way it never was before. So does the presence of Stan's helper, Oscar (Carlo Alban), whose family comes from Colombia.

There is little doubt that when the rage festering among them fully erupts, no one will emerge unscarred. The shriveled, drug-addled figure of Cynthia's estranged husband, Brucie (John Earl Jelks), looms as a possible prophecy of everyone else's fate. Until the play's penultimate scene, ""Sweat"" keeps the nature of its climactic act of violence a secret, and the sense of mystery is underscored by questions posed and unanswered -- between mothers and sons, and the men and their parole officer, Evan (Lance Coadie Williams) -- in the 2008 scenes. At the same time, all the characters in ""Sweat"" are given to elaborate passages of exposition, laying out the histories of their families, their employers, their city. Some of these, such as Tracey's speech about the devaluing of manual labor, have a poignant lyricism. But they are passages that turn those delivering these monologues into social case studies, a status that the bluntly drawn performances do not always combat. The soliloquies might just as easily belong to a series of human-interest news features as to a play. You appreciate Ms. Nottage's insistence that we be able to trace exactly the sources of her character's unhappiness. But a little more indirection would be more dramatically satisfying. ""Sweat"" is best at its muddiest, when love and hate, and the urges to strike out and to comfort, teeter in precipitous balance. That's when Ms. Nottage's characters, and the cast members who embody them, emerge in their full tragic humanity.",Lynn Nottage's bracingly topical play explores the working-class anger and anxieties that put Donald J. Trump in the White House.,7602d396-e8a6-5087-9ed9-048769e49df7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/27/arts/27SWEAT/27SWEAT-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=db58596e72591fa32379d41771296ddd60350e6fcc378796701aa7ab6dc1c28b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, John Earl Jelks, Carlo Albán, Johanna Day, Michelle Wilson and Allison Wright in the play ""Sweat.""",7602d396-e8a6-5087-9ed9-048769e49df7,N24News/imgs/7602d396-e8a6-5087-9ed9-048769e49df7.jpg,10
Style,"Be a Friend to the Elderly, Get Paid",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/style/companion-elderly-aid-friend.html,"Bill Rodger, 91, often finds himself sitting on a worn flower-print couch in his living room in North Hollywood, Calif., facing a wall of accolades that document his long life. There are photos of Mr. Rodger over the decades winning sports tournaments and posing with grandchildren. There are golf medals, plaques and the most recent addition, a monthly bird calendar. ""I'd rather be busy, but I haven't been busy in a really long time,"" Mr. Rodger said in late January from this position, his voice trailing off. ""I guess going to the doctor keeps me busy."" The admission warranted a warm pat on Mr. Rodger's shoulder from a smiling young man sitting beside him. Ricardo Figueroa, 31, isn't a family member or caretaker or even a neighbor. He's a paid companion who was connected to Mr. Rodger through Papa, a health tech company that provides ""grandkids on demand.""

Before the new coronavirus pandemic, the two spent multiple hours together each week -- running errands, going to dialysis appointments, or just watching movies. Today, their relationship is restricted to phone calls but they remain close. ""The whole situation is so scary,"" said Mr. Figueroa on the phone, from his home. ""So just talking to him is so uplifting."" Likewise, Mr. Rodger said, ""It's good to hear from him!"" The two men are a good match by design. Founded in 2018, Papa pairs older adults with college students and young workers who have common interests and hobbies. Mr. Rodger and Mr. Figueroa are both military veterans who enjoy documentaries, sports and an occasional beer, and they live within a few blocks of each other. But whereas the 5,000 Papa pals once played card games or worked on memoirs with the seniors they have befriended, today they are FaceTiming or calling each other to discuss a world in disarray. Some have shifted to running errands, picking up groceries or prescriptions. For these and other tasks, they make between $11 and $14 an hour, not including tips and covered expenses like gas, on a freelance basis. (Papa is currently available in 20 states; the company typically charges clients $20 to $25 an hour.)

Despite the low wage, this is still vital work. According to a 2018 AARP Foundation survey, roughly one-third of older adults in the United States are socially isolated, a state that is linked to increased health risks, including heart disease, cancer, depression, diabetes and suicide. Vivek Murthy, the former United States surgeon general, has written that loneliness and social isolation are ""associated with a reduction in life span similar to that caused by smoking 15 cigarettes a day."" And the problem has an impact on the health care system. Last year, there were thousands of emergency room visits in Dallas that had nothing to do with physical ailments at all. The patients were just completely socially isolated, without anyone to turn to for help. ""Loneliness is now finally being recognized as a disease, not only at a personal level, but also from a health care perspective,"" said Andrew Parker, 32, who founded Papa in 2018. His company is one of several that aims to be a stopgap, and health insurers who may be looking to cut costs have begun to take notice. Mr. Rodger's family is paying for Papa because of a conundrum: Mr. Rodger's granddaughter Tanya Martin had been his primary caretaker for more than four years. But once Mr. Rodger needed dialysis, it became too much for her to handle with her full-time job as an airplane mechanic. He didn't qualify to have further assistance covered by his health insurance, but he also couldn't afford a private caretaker, which can cost about $300 a day in Los Angeles, according to the prices Ms. Martin was quoted.

It's a very tough time to be one of the 1.5 million Americans who currently live in nursing homes. About one-fifth of U.S. virus deaths are linked to nursing facilities, and employees, who are often poorly paid and have multiple jobs, are overtaxed and afraid for their own families. Visitors have been banned, heightening the atmosphere of fear and isolation. Even before the pandemic, caregivers and aides were often overtaxed, tasked with helping many other residents and with little time to socialize. Emotional support can be hard to come by. ""There's no real meaningful conversation,"" said Liz Barlowe, the president of the Aging Life Care Association, a nonprofit representing senior care professionals. ""There is that lack of connectedness, of being present and hyper-focused on one person.""

So Mon Ami, another company that facilitates senior companion services through nursing homes and for individuals, recently set up a volunteer phone bank to support older people isolated by shelter-in-place orders. It drew 300 hundred volunteers within days. (The company's founders, Madeline Dangerfield-Cha, 32, and Joy Zhang, 31, said that Mon Ami's paid companions have also shifted to phone calls or virtual visits, staying in touch with seniors by putting on mini concerts, reading books aloud and instructing gentle movement exercises.) One of those volunteers is Morgan Steele, 25, a clinical research coordinator at Stanford University. She was recently paired with Hugh Ping, 77, with whom she chats several times a week. Mon Ami suggests that companions and clients chat for 15 to 30 minutes at a time, ""but we can talk well over half an hour without even realizing it,"" Ms. Steele said. Mr. Ping's daughter, Deanna Ping, said it has been challenging to strip her sociable father from the small interactions that were ""very major to him"": He loved venturing out from his home in the Bay Area to go to the drugstore and to restaurants where he knew all the staff. ""It brings me a lot of peace to know there are others to talk with him,"" she said. Often, in conversation with Ms. Steele, Mr. Ping compares the current situation to having lived through the Cuban missile crisis when he was in the Air Force. ""He talks about a time where people didn't know if their whole world was ending,"" Ms. Steele said. It helps keep things in perspective. ""We think we have it bad when we're working from home with our significant other or roommates, but then you start to realize there are people who are literally so alone,"" Ms. Steele said. ""A half-hour call can really brighten their day.""

For paid companion positions, both Papa and Mon Ami screen potential candidates through in-depth interviews, as well as through background and motor vehicle checks. (The volunteer bank is far less intensively screened, though still requires an application.) While a majority of companions have relevant experience -- as nurses, social workers or medical school students -- Ms. Zhang said Mon Ami looks for those who possess social and emotional intelligence skills, those who ""can be present and can engage with someone who is very different from you."" It's an appealing gig for students with flexible schedules or for those who now find themselves with time on their hands. (Mon Ami companions work an average of four hours per week.) But the benefits go both ways. The start-up routinely hears that the work does as much for their emotional well-being of many of companions as it may do for the seniors. Ms. Dangerfield-Cha is clear that Mon Ami is but one option in an industry suffering from a senior care shortage. About 10,000 people turn 65 each day, and 43 percent envision aging in their primary home. Estimates from the Census Bureau indicate that Americans over the age of 65 will comprise nearly 20 percent of the total population by 2030. ""The reality is that as our society is aging more rapidly than at any other time in history, we need all types of support,"" Ms. Dangerfield-Cha said. ""We're going to need all of it -- and then some."" To that point, AARP data shows that those who are socially isolated cost an additional $6.7 billion in Medicare spending; Papa already works with 10 health plans, including Humana, Aetna and Florida Blue, and the company is pursuing more partnerships, including offering the service to new parents and other caregivers. It has raised $12.6 million in venture funding to date.

As it expands, Papa is also working to safeguard its continuing companionships, like that of Mr. Figueroa and Mr. Rodger. Not that the two need much oversight. They already have big plans once the world reverts to normal. ""I want to get into golfing now, thanks to him,"" Mr. Figueroa said of Mr. Rodger. ""As soon as we're clear to go out, we're definitely going to get out there in the field."" Mr. Rodger, excited by the prospect of a day on the putting green, couldn't contain his enthusiasm -- or his grandfatherly tendencies. ""I have some pointers,"" he said. ""I could help you.""","Combating loneliness is vital work.

Travel,"In France, Biking Along Arcachon Bay",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/02/travel/france-arcachon-bay-biking.html,"It was midnight in the French forest off the Gulf of Gascony, and I pedaled along the deserted bike trail, fueled by the fumes of a fabulous bottle of Bordeaux and the memory of a seaside feast: oysters and turbot, overseen by a grandmotherly patronne in a flowered housedress. Far ahead my husband's bike light glimmered through the dense pines. Suddenly he stopped and waited for me. ""Cherie, can't you go a bit faster?"" Guy said rather anxiously. Later, I learned that a boar had just crashed through the woods in front of him. Wild pigs aside, biking along the forested, level trails of France's southwestern Atlantic Coast feeds a fluid frame of mind conducive to indulging in simple pleasures like the aroma of pine resin; the crush of sunshine in a clearing; the impulsive detour to a waterfront chapel; or a lengthy, wine-enhanced meal without worrying about Breathalyzer-wielding gendarmes. Even so, I used care in planning our bike journey last summer around Arcachon Bay, a kind of Gallic Cape Cod-meets-the-Hamptons, an hour's drive southwest of Bordeaux. Fifty miles in five days seemed ideal, leaving plenty of time for visits to fishing hamlets and wetlands, and for exploring the belle epoque in Arcachon, the bay's nexus, where Europe's fin de siecle high society built fanciful Victorian mansions in the shadow of the mile-and-a-half-long Great Dune of Pilat, Europe's highest sand dune, which stretches along the bay like a huge white Band-Aid. Finally, as my husband's local cousins noted, by biking we'd avoid summer traffic on the road leading into the Cape side of the bay, often jammed by ""outsiders"" (Parisians and other wealthy vacationers) who, over the last decade, have joined the bling-averse folks from Bordeaux and environs who have traditionally summered on the windswept 15-mile-long spit of land between bay and ocean. Even so, I had to dangle a bribe to my speed-loving husband who, like others who hail from the land of the Tour de France, seems genetically programmed to get from one point to another posthaste. ""When we return,"" I promised him, as he gazed longingly at the gleaming rental scooters parked outside Locabeach, the bike shop opposite Arcachon's gingerbread trimmed train station. For now, my plan was to rent the cushiest-seated bicycles possible, load our gear in saddlebags and head for the pier, where we'd hop the small ferry (named L'Embellie, or the ""Lovely One"") for the half-hour chug to the Cape. Then we'd begin riding back to our starting point.

On this limpid, sunny day my eyes could almost take in the entire triangular-shaped bay, from the muddy tidal flats at its back to the sifting sand banks at its mouth. It was les vacances, and even the small dogs in carrying cases were relaxed. I convinced my deeply tanned bench mate, Jo Brousse, who had been ""coming here for years,"" to divulge her favorite spots, which included Chez Hortense, a family-owned restaurant at the Cape's point. ""It's an institution,"" she said. ""People from Arcachon boat across for dinner. Order the turbot."" The prospect of turbot was irresistible, even though it would mean a 10-mile round trip from the B & B I'd reserved in Le Petit Piquey. But it was late July and we had no schedule. Along the smooth, well-marked bike path, the air was spicy and hot, full of buzzing cicadas. Our only concern was avoiding pinecones and giving way to the handful of spandex-clad cyclists on the trail. Emerging from the forest path on our way to Chez Hortense, we pedaled for a mile or so along the two-lane road and headed around the Cap Ferret lighthouse, named after the main village (which is not to be confused with the better-known Cap Ferrat on the Riviera), and along the hollyhock-lined lanes toward the bay front oyster shacks.

At the end of a dirt path we leaned our bikes against a fig tree. Barefoot girls in sundresses and boys in shorts played tag in a sandy lot while their parents sat on the waterfront decks of oyster shacks sipping wine and hovering over platters of bivalves on rustic wooden tables. The Great Dune, iridescent in the sun's glow, anchored the far side of the water. Soon, we were sampling our own oysters, which were so fresh they contracted from their silvery shells under a spritz of lemon juice. Corks were still popping when we tore ourselves away at 9. Signs for Hortense, posted at crossroads in the ramshackle neighborhood of coveted vacation cottages around the point, led us to the restaurant. The fact that the owners of the BMWs, Mercedeses and vintage convertibles out front were among the patrons gathered on the beachfront veranda didn't detract from the friendly service or the attention of Bernadette, the founder's aging granddaughter. I suspect running a 100-year-old legacy that's persevered despite violent tides, tempests and even requisition by the Nazis as their local cafeteria imparts humility. Even the perfectly baked turbot comes from a long tradition, according to our waitress, who said the purveyor, in Brittany, has supplied the restaurant since 1936. The next morning we hit the Cap Ferret market. On previous visits, I'd noticed the high-quality merchandise at the outdoor stands: Basque table linens, espadrilles and Turkish cotton foutas (used here as beach towels). This time, I headed inside past butchers, fishmongers and fruit stalls straight to Chez Pascal, generally regarded as the best bakery on the Cape. I stood patiently in the long line and ordered a half-dozen ""White Dunes"" -- addictive, bite-size cream puffs sprinkled with powdered sugar and named after the bay's landmark. All this biking was definitely ""opening up my appetite"" as Guy so delicately put it.

The next leg of our journey had a historic twist. A friend from Bordeaux had put me in touch with Sabine Lesca, whose great-uncle, Leon Lesca, was a philanthropic real estate mogul of the area in the mid-1800s, when he used some of his fortune to develop the Cape and build a legendary Moorish-style mansion and chapel inspired by his love of North Africa. ""When I was a child in the 1950s, we'd spend the whole summer here at Grandmother's house, barefoot all day, helping the oyster farmers and swimming,"" Ms. Lesca reminisced as we strolled through the sandy alleys of Le Petit Piquey and l'Herbe, two preserved fishing hamlets, mostly consisting of clubhouse-size pine-plank cabins, and once her family's stamping grounds. ""There was no running water then, and they'd call us back for dinner with a hunting horn,"" she said. ""My great-uncle's Villa Algerienne was our landmark, with its green cupola and colored windows."" Sadly, the villa was demolished in the mid-1960s, but the bay front Chapelle Algerienne, now a national monument restored to its polychrome glory, remains. ""The bay inspired Laurent de Brunhoff to write ""Babar's Visit to Bird Island,"" Ms. Lesca said, as we stood in the chapel's front archway, looking out toward the island. Colorful wooden flat-bottomed fishing boats called pinasses were beached on the glossy mud. ""Jean Cocteau wrote here, too. Now, Marion Cotillard lives behind the chapel,"" she continued, ""and Philippe Starck has a house nearby.""

Looking at her watch, she brightened. It was 11:30 a.m. ""Would you like to join me for some oysters?"" she asked. Once we were sufficiently fortified, we pedaled around to the back of the bay, stopping at the Cabane du Resinier, a one-room eco-museum in a former resin tapper's hut, where we learned that the pine forest's ""black gold"" provided livelihoods for many through the 1960s. As we proceeded through salt marshes and past the working-class town of Ares toward Andernos-les-Bains-- the back of the bay's commercial center -- the sea, sand and sun vibe gave way to the lively community fabric of year-round residents, many of whom work in Bordeaux. We didn't stop at the pier (one of the longest in France, at 761 feet) with its bistros and bars, but headed straight for the recently restored 11th-century St. Eloi Church, one of the area's oldest buildings, on the foundations of a fourth-century Gallo-Roman villa. Outside, artists had set up easels under the shade of parasol pines. Inside, the stone floor was splashed with shards of color from light streaming through contemporary stained glass windows.

We wanted to linger in Andernos, exploring the neighborhoods of vacation cottages and gabled houses trimmed in red, blue or green, with names like Mon Repos, Primavera and Fantasia. We would have enjoyed a glass of wine at the newest tapas bar, Loft 33, which we passed on the trail. But we had an evening date with the birds at our next stop, 15 miles away. The 9 p.m. sunset bird safari turned out to be a highlight of our trip. ""Arcachon Bay, and the marshy delta here, is like a huge, self-service hotel-restaurant for over 300 species of migratory and nesting birds throughout the year,"" Anne Parisot, a naturalist and guide for the Teich Bird Reserve, told our group at the park entrance. ""Here you're on one of the world's main bird migration routes,"" she continued, speaking above an occasional heron screech. After we ogled the huge storks nesting in the tree branches, the rest of the tour was like herding cats. Birders are an independent bunch. So if they hear, say, the bluethroat's song or spot a kingfisher or a spoonbill, you'd best raise your binoculars and get comfortable because they're not moving from the path or bird blind (there are 20, along three miles of trails) until they get their fill.

The next morning we headed for the coastal bike route skirting the sleepy ports leading to Arcachon. Before lunch, I visited the excellent oyster heritage museum in Gujan-Mestras. Guy hung around Dubourdieu, the Hermes of boat builders, founded in 1800, where two young guys fussed over a stunning custom-built yacht constructed of mahogany and white oak. Later, in Arcachon, after an easy ride past the town's port bristling with boat masts, and along the crowded beachfront sidewalk, I made good on my scooter promise. In fact, I was glad to be on a scooter instead of a bicycle as we sped up the winding roads to Arcachon's Winter Town (as opposed to its beachy Summer Town along the bay), with its hundreds of Victorian-era villas in a pastiche of belvederes, balconies, palm trees and mimosa high above the water. The back lanes and overgrown plots of this residential neighborhood, founded in 1862 as a sanitarium for tuberculosis patients, opened a portal to another era when doctors believed consumption could be cured by the bay's maritime air, and wealthy European invalids believed in the restorative power of Champagne and a night at the quarter's Moorish-style casino.

Across a footbridge we found the St.-Cecilia Observatory, a fragile-looking 80-foot-high steel tower built, with the help of Gustave Eiffel, in 1863. We climbed the stairs and watched the sun fall, spectacularly, across the bay and behind the Cap Ferret lighthouse where we began our ride. Lights along the coastline began to twinkle, leading to the ocean's wild expanse. Watching the seawater rush through the bay's narrow neck, I thought of Baudelaire's words, inscribed on a building I had noticed in the old town port earlier in the day: ""Free man, you will always cherish the sea."" Despite the magnificent view, we didn't linger. It was time for the aperitif. If You Go Bike rental outfits, trail maps, itineraries and cycle-friendly lodging are available at bassin-arcachon-velo.com. Lovely small hotels, like La Maison du Bassin, lamaisondubassin.com (doubles from 140 euros, about $152 at $1.08 to the euro), on the less-developed Cape side of the Bay fill up quickly, especially in the popular summer season. Bed-and-breakfasts -- like the Cap'acabana, capacabana.com (from 90 euros), a hilltop aerie with swimming pool -- are a good option, as is La Cabane de Pomme de Pin, chambres-hotes-cap-ferret.com (from 200 euros). In Arcachon, upscale Hotel Ville d'Hiver (hotelvilledhiver.com) is in the restored 19th-century waterworks of the city's atmospheric hilltop Winter Town (from 140 euros). A more basic nearby option is the Hotel Marinette, hotel-marinette.com (from 45 euros).

Chez Hortense (Avenue du Semaphore, Lege-Cap-Ferret; chez-hortense.fr; dinner around 50 euros) is a local seafood institution. Our favorite bivalve feast, though, was at Cap au Large (Port de la Hume, Gujan-Mestras, 33-5-56-66-18-12; seafood platters, 22 euros), a seafood purveyor and casual restaurant on the picturesque Port de la Hume owned by Sophie and David Dupuy, whose families have been oyster farmers and fishermen for six generations and who will also take you out to their oyster beds in the bay.

Movies,A Writer-Director-Star Breaks Through. It Only Took a Lifetime.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/movies/radha-blank-40-year-old-version.html,"On a recent September morning, Radha Blank sat on a paint-blistered bench just above Riverbank State Park, soaking up the late-summer sun. Trucks thundered by on the highway below. Wasps circled a garbage can. Blank's surgical mask tangled with her hoop earrings, but nothing could kill her mood. She cooed at a small dog in a zebra-striped jacket. The dog paused and released a stream of urine. ""He just blessed us,"" she said. Blank had last visited this Hamilton Heights block about a year ago, on the first day of filming for the ""The Forty-Year-Old Version,"" which premieres on Netflix on Oct. 9. Blank wrote the movie. She also directed it. She stars, too, playing a character named Radha, a struggling New York playwright who passed her next-big-thing sell-by-date a decade ago. But the movie argues that self-discovery doesn't have an age limit. After a meeting with a producer goes violently wrong -- he asks her to write the book for a Harriet Tubman musical; she chokes him -- Radha spends the night crying into a carton of takeout ribs and the morning dreaming up a new career.

Coming back to this spot a year later felt therapeutic, she said, ""because I was so nervous then. And everyone's butt was clenched. Everyone was just like, 'Is this going to work?'"" ""The Forty-Year-Old Version,"" shot on 35-millimeter black-and-white film, won the directing competition at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival and immediately scored a Netflix deal. It worked. For Blank, in her patterned dress, bright sneakers and squashed fedora, clenching seemed a thing of the past. The outline of ""The Forty-Year-Old Version"" resembles plenty of other comedies. A big-city screw-up unscrewing? Been there. Seen that. (The title, a search engine optimization nightmare, plays on Judd Apatow's ""The Forty-Year-Old Virgin."") But the heroes of movies like these don't usually look like Blank -- female, Black, not an ingenue, not a sample size. ""The thing that makes it maybe groundbreaking is that someone who looks like me is at the center and behind the camera,"" Blank said.

The film, Blank's first, isn't pure autobiography. She has yet to choke a producer. But the apartment in the movie is her apartment. Her actual brother plays her brother. The pain of continuing to believe in yourself as an artist when the art world thinks otherwise and candles on the birthday cakes won't stop coming? That's all her. ""I guess I am kind of putting myself out there,"" she said. Blank, who gives her age as ""in my 40s,"" had been putting herself out there for a while. She grew up in the Williamsburg neighborhood of Brooklyn, performing for family and friends, then discovered theater at City College, mostly by accident. During her postgrad years, she acted, did stand-up and wrote plays without receiving much in the way of external validation. In 2008, she was accepted into the Public Theater's Emerging Writers Group, a prestigious program for early-career playwrights. Theater stars like Branden Jacobs-Jenkins and Dominique Morisseau would join subsequent classes. By the time the program ended, Blank had 12 plays written. No major company would produce them. She took meeting after unsuccessful meeting, crying her eyes out in theater lobbies afterward. ""I don't think theater embraced her,"" said Keith Josef Adkins, the artistic director of the New Black Fest and an early champion of Blank's work.

Her one produced work, ""Seed,"" staged at the National Black Theater in 2011, earned a mixed review from The New York Times. Blank can still quote it. ""It called my play 'low-budget,'"" she said. Niegel Smith, who directed ""Seed"" and now runs the Flea Theater, described her plays as ""honest and raw,"" but also full of comedy and joy. ""It wasn't just Black trauma,"" he said. ""It wasn't just Black pain."" ""Seed"" sold out its run. It wasn't produced again. A year or two later, after being fired from a screenwriting job, she put her frustrations on paper, writing a 10-episode, lightly fictionalized web series about reinventing herself as a rapper, RadhaMUS Prime. Then, two weeks before shooting began, Blank's mother died. Blank scrapped the series. ""She was my best friend,"" Blank said. ""She was my first audience member and my biggest champion. I really just couldn't imagine creating art without her in the audience."" Blank didn't abandon the project entirely. She performed RadhaMUS hip-hop songs around town. And after moving to Los Angeles to join the writers' room of Baz Luhrmann's ""The Get Down,"" she reinvented her series, first as a pilot, then as a screenplay. Michelle Satter, the director of the Sundance Institute's feature film program, solicited a draft and invited Blank to join the institute's prestigious screenwriting lab. (Blank would also do stints in the directing and creative producing labs.) Satter remembers listening to the first live reading of Blank's script. ""It was absolutely electric,"" she said. ""We knew we were in the company of a filmmaker who is going to have a big career. At age 40.""

Producers weren't sure. Some tried to dissuade her from black-and-white film, which Blank saw as a homage to the movies she grew up loving. (She namechecked Cassavetes and, sheepishly, a director she would only refer to as ""Schmoody Schmallen."") Others encouraged her to cast star actors. Blank refused. She hadn't compromised herself during her years in theater. She wouldn't compromise now. She didn't have to. At the Sundance Festival in 2019, she met up with the writer, actor and producer Lena Waithe (""The Chi""), a longtime friend. As they sat together after a screening, Waithe said to her, ""Girl, where's your movie at? That's what I want to see."" With Blank's consent, Waithe quickly found financing and the movie went into production last summer. Blank shot it in 21 days.

Kim, who plays Radha's best friend and agent, remembered watching her on set. ""She was never sitting still,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""She was running around like a Tasmanian devil. But whenever she was ready to shoot, she was ready."" Seen one way, Blank has been ready for years. Her talent, her candor, her comedy -- none of that is new. But to look back through the viewfinder is to realize that it took all those years of experience -- the acting, the writing, the rapping, the teaching, the career letdowns, the loss of her mother -- to make ""The Forty-Year-Old Version"" this distinct and vulnerable. ""I really literally have put everything in there,"" she said. Which means that she has made sacrifices. ""Whether it's relationships or being a mother, this thing has kind of had a hold on me for most of my life. And I've treated it like a life partner, making it my priority,"" she said.","Radha Blank spent years trying to impress the theater world. Now, her Sundance hit, ""The Forty-Year-Old Version,"" is proof that dreams don't expire.",43badff2-4d9e-5e63-bc34-22288da19bad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/11/arts/11radha-blank1/11radha-blank1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9b25eb9afa61626b312a225acc14065006393797ddf8c6fbcb2e87b517eea981&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Blank says of the movie: ""The thing that makes it maybe groundbreaking is that someone who looks like me is at the center and behind the camera.""",43badff2-4d9e-5e63-bc34-22288da19bad,N24News/imgs/43badff2-4d9e-5e63-bc34-22288da19bad.jpg,5
Opinion,Senator Rick Scott: Don't Get Duped by China,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/opinion/letters/china-us.html,"Re ""China and U.S. Can Have Cooperative Competition"" (Op-Ed, Nov. 25): Fu Ying, a former vice foreign minister of China, suggests the need for an equal and candid conversation. She is right. Both sides should be honest about what is going on. The Chinese Communist Party is committing a genocide. The United States is the world's best and loudest advocate for human rights, and our founding principles have shaped the world's understanding of liberty and democracy. Communist China is trying to expand borders beyond its territorial control in a quest for world dominance. The United States will stand against those who encroach on others' sovereign territory. China regularly steals American research and technology, and tech companies like TikTok and Huawei are required by Chinese law to turn over data to the Chinese Communist Party.

Every time the party speaks, it tells one-sided stories and half-truths, and Ms. Fu's article is no different. Questions surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine and its rollout.
* If Covid-19 isn't going away, how do we live with it? 

Katherine Eban writes that a clear-eyed view is required to organize long-term against an endemic virus.
* Why should we vaccinate kids against Covid-19? 

The president of the American Academy of Pediatrics explains how vaccinating kids will protect them (and everyone else).
* Jessica Grose spoke with experts to find out what an off-ramp to masking in schools might look like.
* Who are the unvaccinated? 

Zeynep Tufekci writes that many preconceptions about unvaccinated people may be wrong, and that could be a good thing. We can no longer pretend that Communist China is an ally with good intentions, merely a partner with customs and a political system that we don't fully understand. Communist China is a totalitarian regime bent on world domination, and as long as its officials refuse to tell the truth or respect human rights, they will be treated as such. Rick Scott

Re ""Why Scrub for Show if the Virus Can Waft Freely?"" (news article, Nov. 20): Here's a follow-up question: Since we now know that virus droplets are the main cause of coronavirus transmission, and these droplets are particularly dangerous in areas with poor ventilation, why isn't more effort being made to help schools upgrade their heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems? Earlier this year, the Government Accountability Office estimated that 41 percent of school districts need to update or replace HVAC systems in at least half their school buildings; that's about 36,000 schools. Even before Covid, more than 14 million school days were missed every year because of asthma, a chronic condition worsened by poor indoor air quality.

It's easier to find funding for cleaning products than for structural improvements, which is why many schools focus on disinfecting. Yet we must consider the health risks from over-cleaning and using more chemicals in poorly ventilated areas, especially in low-income communities that are already most affected by the coronavirus. Congress needs to pass the Heroes Act, which includes $5 billion to support K-12 school facilities, to help schools reopen safely. Scrubbing surfaces makes us feel safer, but clean desks won't matter if schools don't have clean air. Rochelle Davis

Science,"Giraffes, Towering and Otherworldly, Are 'Vulnerable' to Extinction",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/08/science/giraffe-extinction.html,"The majestic giraffe, the world's tallest land mammal and a prime attraction at zoos worldwide, is threatened with extinction because of illegal hunting and a loss of its habitat, according to a report published on Thursday by an international monitoring group. The giraffe population has declined by 40 percent over the past three decades and now stands at about 97,600, according to the findings by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, which designates endangered species. While the largest giraffe populations reside in national parks and reserves, those protected areas have proved to be inadequate, one of several alarming conclusions about the animals' future in the group's latest Red List of Threatened Species report. ""While global attention has been on threats to elephants and rhinos, giraffes have been off the radar, and we've been losing them in significant numbers,"" said Liz Bennett, the vice president for species conservation for the Wildlife Conservation Society, which was not involved in the report. ""People and governments need to start acting to save giraffes, fast.""

With their soaring heights of up to 20 feet and their stunning necks, which are typically about six feet long, giraffes have long been the stuff of dreams -- for children who love to draw them and for adults who retain an awe for the otherworldly creatures. Their tongues can extend a foot or more, making feeding times an especially popular sight at zoos and on safari. Yet the animals' rare size and regal visage have made them a prime target of poachers in Africa, who drop steel-wire snares from tree canopies or stalk and shoot giraffes with rifles, wildlife experts say. The threat to giraffes is so great that the Red List upgraded the species from the ""least concern"" category to ""vulnerable,"" skipping over the intermediary ""near-threatened"" designation. Graver categories include ""critically endangered,"" ""extinct in the wild"" and, ultimately, ""extinct."" The animals are divided into nine subspecies; according to the Red List report, five have decreasing populations, three are on the increase, and one is stable.

One bright spot: The numbers of West African giraffes are on the rise, numbering about 400 now, up from 50 in the 1990s. This remains the smallest of the subspecies. Asked if it was possible for giraffes to become extinct in the wild in the next 20 years if nothing is done, Derek Lee, an ecologist who contributed to the Red List report, paused for several moments during a phone interview on Thursday from Tanzania. He then said, ""I think we'd see drastic declines at the very least."" Giraffes are found mostly in southern and eastern Africa, with smaller populations in West and Central Africa. Some of those populations are particularly vulnerable because of war and other civil unrest in countries on the Continent, like Sudan. Poaching and the loss of habitat are ""equally dangerous threats that vary in degree from place to place,"" said Dr. Lee, who is a founder of the Wild Nature Institute. While governments and organizations could take stronger actions against poaching by enforcing laws and animal protection rules, habitat loss can be harder to stop because it involves curbing economic activity, such as land development, mining and scavenging. ""These are problems everywhere for giraffes,"" Dr. Lee said. ""You need to stop both threats."" The threat to giraffes is not expected to affect their numbers at zoos in New York and other cities around the world, wildlife specialists said, because zookeepers have a good record helping the animals with reproduction. Still, zoo leaders are likely to consider changing signs at their exhibits to stress the animals' vulnerability to extinction as a way to raise public awareness. ""That would be the best way to get the word out to people that we need to do more to protect these animals,"" said Dr. Bennett, of the conservation society, which runs the Bronx Zoo, the New York Aquarium and other zoos in the city.","The population of the world's tallest land mammal has dropped by 40 percent in three decades, a report said.",8d155bcf-5b12-51be-b781-d9f6b772a0bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/09/world/09giraffe_xp/09giraffe_xp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=4d4460e93122a71fe7667cc44dbeaec7c76b2b274b0e33c54c94b5f180009e98&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A giraffe in Amboseli National park, Kenya, in August.",8d155bcf-5b12-51be-b781-d9f6b772a0bf,N24News/imgs/8d155bcf-5b12-51be-b781-d9f6b772a0bf.jpg,2
Science,What Swims Like a Duck and Quacks Like a Duck Could Be a Hybrid of Two Duck Species,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/science/ducks-mallard-mottled-hybrid.html,"A duck is a duck, right? Well, yes, but when one duck mates with a duck of another species, there's the risk that one of the original species could cease to exist. And then that duck is a duck no more.

But who cares? A new, hybrid duck will emerge, and that duck is a duck, right? Maybe over geological time that would be true. But in a natural world affected by human activity, ecologists and conservationists worry that hybridization can upset ecological balances and undermine the survival of species involved in such a blend. Although not a problem yet, a study published Thursday in The Condor: Ornithological Applications suggests the riddling possibility that two duck species forming a hybrid species could one day leave us with less diversity among North American ducks.

This study is the first to assess the rate at which mallard and Mottled Ducks are combining into hybrids in the western Gulf of Mexico region of the United States. Their results highlight important questions about the interbreeding of species: How much of it is nature doing its own work? How much of it is influenced by humans? And at what point should we be concerned?

You've probably met the mallard -- green head, frequents city parks, gobbles up your tossed bread, migrates (generally) and likes water of all kinds but isn't too keen on coastal waters. This duck is perhaps the most common in the world. In winter, you can find it in swamps, marshes and estuaries along the Mississippi Valley.","Hybridization has nearly wiped out bird species in the past, so researchers studied whether mallard ducks could put pressure on less-common Mottled ducks.",d28cb375-da02-5f2d-8c7e-380f950ec6fa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/science/12TB-DUCK1/12TB-DUCK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3eec4921f3600bd9f70277b5a35bb9f672e2644e50e45965c383090a0539b94f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A new study look at the rate at which mallard ducks, like this one are mating with mottled ducks to create hybrids.

Well,The Healing Power of Baseball,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/01/well/baseball-coronavirus-masks-quarantine-war-influenza.html,"A friend and fellow baseball fan recently sent an email and an old photo to offer his appreciation to our medical staff. Gleaned from the archives of the National Baseball Hall of Fame, the image showed an exhibition game played in Pasadena, Calif., in Jan. 1919. The scene shows the batter, catcher and umpire all wearing surgical masks, as are those watching from the grandstand. The image was captured just a few months before the third and final wave of the devastating influenza pandemic that emerged in 1918.

One hundred years later, we are all wearing masks again -- but without the game.

It is a cruel twist of biology that the social distancing required in response to the Covid-19 epidemic has also necessarily robbed us of baseball, something that might help to heal our souls. But wait we must -- for a sport that has previously proved nearly impervious to both war and pestilence.

During the pandemic of 1918, the World Series was held after a regular season abbreviated not because of influenza, but because of the Great War in Europe. Though ill-advised from a medical perspective, the Red Sox and Cubs were given dispensation until Sept. 15 to play the World Series, whereupon the war department's ""work or fight"" order would be enforced, requiring the ballplayers to do one or the other in service to the nation. The Red Sox defeated the Cubs four games to two, bolstered by the pitching performance of a young lefthander named Babe Ruth.

Baseball continued to play uninterrupted during World War II following President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's ""Green Light"" letter written in early 1942 to Kenesaw Mountain Landis, the first Commissioner of Baseball.

Health,"At the Westminster Dog Show: Top Dogs, Top Docs",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/health/westminster-dogshow-veterinarians.html,"Credit...

America's premier canine competition is not just a beauty contest. Supporting elite athletes (and their owners) is a growing pack of massage and sports medicine specialists.



At least the athlete was able to walk into the medical tent on his own four legs. Earlier, when he had faced the broad jump during his Masters Obedience Championship trial at the Westminster Dog Show, Finn, a six-pound toy poodle, had tried to settle into his normal pre-takeoff sit position. But he wriggled uncomfortably, struggling to hold something in. Sensing disaster, his human, Abby Cooper, swooped him up, managing to get him out of the ring just before he vomited and pooped on the sawdust. Off to the veterinarian tent they rushed. Official dog competitions typically include a standby vet. But Westminster, perhaps the premier elite canine event in the country, demands a crack medical squad of another order altogether. Special dogs need special docs.

Finn was monitored by Dr. Christopher Frye from the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine, an assistant clinical professor in the new area of sports medicine and rehabilitation. Also on the 15-member team from Ithaca and its satellite specialty office in Stamford, Conn. were a radiologist and a theriogenologist, who specializes in reproduction -- of keen interest to breeders of show and performance dogs. Throughout Westminster Week, they would be fielding questions from spectators and owners as specific and general as their practices: about breed genetic problems; refractive eye tests (is my Boston terrier nearsighted?), stem cell injections for aching joints; clinical oncology trials; how to care for a first puppy. Westminster is famous as a gathering of spectacular dogs, with all the people and products attendant with canine beauty pageantry: sprays, mousses, gels, conditioners, curlers, straighteners, bows, hair implants (I'm looking at you, Standard Poodles!) and mascara (flutter those lashes much, Papillon?).

But in the last few years, Westminster has added competitions in agility and obedience, events that bring in a very different crowd -- jock dogs and their humans. (""Vanish is not just some Barbie collie,"" Aaron Kirzner said of his border collie, which is both a breed and agility champion.) Those athletes are attended by a throng of health and wellness specialists, including canine acupuncturists, massage therapists and chiropractors, along with vets like Dr. Frye. Over the last few days, the vets' cases have included: a broken toenail; a sore toe (stuck in the crate during a long car haul); lots of nauseous anxiety (planes, crowds); a flopped ear (inflammation); and rash (the quality of the hotel sheets disagreed with one top show dog). Finn was fine, by the way. Dr. Frye excused him from the show and sent him home. ""'Home' is his pillow on my knee,"" Ms. Cooper said, during a relieved telephone call from her hotel room. The sign was parked before a quiet, curtained corner of the hall: Dog Massage. Marisa Schmidt, a certified canine massage therapist from Hazlet, N.J., had all her agility-day slots booked for months. But throughout the day, owners and dogs were lined outside her curtain, pleading to be squeezed into her schedule. Kyan, a border collie, was on the table. ""She has some knots,"" Ms. Schmidt informed Deborah Salerno, Kyan's owner. She leaned into the dog's spine, lifted a hind leg, working an inner thigh muscle. Kyan's eyes rolled blissfully.

""These dogs are in incredible shape,"" Ms. Schmidt said. ""Their owners take care of them like any professional athlete. Would you believe this dog is 12 years old?"" One challenge, she said, is that dogs can almost love the sport and their commanding owners too much. ""Dogs are so resilient that they will run through the pain,"" she said, ""and sometimes we may not know right away that they're injured.""

For the Masters Agility Championship, 330 invitation-only elite athletes raced over a course of jumps, tunnels, seesaws, A-frames and weaves. Before each round, the humans were allowed to preview the course once, walking it to memorize the series of hand signals they would give their dogs, which would not be permitted to sample the course. Spitting out rapid-fire voice and hand signals for about 30 seconds, the humans would direct their dogs through the course, the two moving as one, a mind-meld team. Athletes never compete with cold muscles. Here is the warm-up routine for Chelsea, a gleaming, champion six-year-old black Labrador retriever that, with her teammate Dr. Elizabeth Dole, a veterinarian, has competed for the United States in European agility trials.

Walk: three to five minutes. Pee. Trot. Stretches: loosen neck and spine by bringing muzzle to hip, both sides. Play bow. Weave between Dr. Dole's legs. Spins. Back up. Come forward. Work that core! Sit pretty in a begging position, paws up, hold it, hold it. Release. More stretches: Dr. Dole leaned on a table, extending a treat. Chelsea put her paws on the table, head up, legs splayed. Hip flexors, shoulders, laterals, obliques. Dr. Dole pulled out a toy. Tug, release, tug, release. ""It's to give her some excitement but also some control,"" said Dr. Dole, who has worked in agility competition for 18 years. ""Some dogs need to be in the optimum arousal state,"" she said. ""But Chelsea is already so eager to play that we want her to be more thoughtful, so when she walks in the ring she's not over the top."" Dr. Frye took a break from the vet tent to watch some of the agility trials. He makes canine prosthetics, studies gaits, manages pain. He sees the world of canine sports as vast and varied, having worked with athletes ranging from sled dogs to racers to dock divers. Like any sports fan, he stood in the thick crowd, whooping as the dogs sped in a blur through the obstacles. The crowd racket matched the dogs that barked and yelped as they raced along, in sheer excitement. Unlike the conformation -- the formal name for the sport of showing purebreds -- agility and obedience welcome mixed-breeds, here simply called All American dogs. That's because these sports are fundamentally a celebration of the human-canine bond.

On Sunday, Tyson, an eight-year-old-miniature American shepherd from Minnesota, needed to go to the vet tent. Tyson is an obedience champion. He is also an anxious flyer with a sensitive stomach. After arriving in New York, he started vomiting. And kept it up, almost hourly. ""I thought, where are we going to find an E.R. vet?"" said his owner, Shannon Wacker, who was there with her 17-year-old daughter, Mara. ""I was heartbroken for my daughter. They had worked so hard to get here.""

Mother, daughter and dog found the Cornell vet tent, who ministered to all three. ""They were a godsend,"" Mrs. Wacker said. ""And they didn't bill me!"" By Sunday afternoon, Tyson was good to go. He did not win a ribbon, but Mrs. Wacker and Mara were thrilled. ""Considering all that happened with him, we're tickled,"" Mrs. Wacker said, saying that Tyson had pushed through his misery out of devotion to her daughter. ""We just needed to get his nerves untangled,"" she said. ""He's just such a little overachiever!""",America's premier canine competition is not just a beauty contest.

Art & Design,Printing a Revolution: The Posters of Paris '68,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/04/arts/design/may-1968-paris.html,"""Clash of Images,"" an exhibition in Paris of posters, paintings, films and other works from the uprising of May 1968 and beyond.



During the major strikes and student uprisings in France that year, the Ecole des Beaux-Arts turned itself into a workshop for revolutionary messages.

PARIS -- Fifty years ago, almost to the day, students here began to strike over the rigidity and hierarchy of the French university system, defying the historical deference of young people to their elders; the same day, workers at a major factory near Nantes walked out. Within days, the strikes spread to other universities and factories, and garbage collectors and office workers joined in. By mid-May, more than 10 million people across France were on strike, and the country had all but come to a standstill. The protests of 1968 ushered in more than five years of social upheaval, intensifying an antiwar movement in Europe and contributing to the women's liberation and gay rights movements. And it all started with a call to upend the old order. ""There was an idea that France was a class society and it had to be torn down,"" said Eric de Chassey, a professor of contemporary art who curated, with Philippe Artieres, ""Clash of Images,"" an exhibition at the Beaux-Arts de Paris. It showcases posters from those early days of social upheaval, as well as art and documents from subsequent protests for women's rights and gay rights.

The Ecole des Beaux-Arts was at the center of the revolt. Many of the prestigious art school's students and teachers occupied the 300-year-old stone structure on the Left Bank of the Seine: Rather than holding meetings only in the building's vast rooms and courtyards, they turned the school into an atelier, or artists' workshop, where they created protest art. The often arresting posters straddled the line between art and propaganda. In keeping with the utopian ideals of collective work and anonymous authorship, the artists labored together to conceptualize, design and write slogans for the posters that framed their revolutionary sentiments. ""Someone would say 'We need a poster that talks about immigration,' "" Mr. de Chassey explained. ""Then someone would propose a design, someone else would propose a slogan and then it would be discussed by a committee.""

The students printed hundreds or sometimes several thousand copies of the posters and taped them to lampposts and walls around Paris. In an era before the internet, the posters became a trusted way to communicate plans for action as well as the protesters' political messages. There was little faith in electronic media at the time because it was state owned. The strikes that began in May 1968 became the template for social protest in contemporary France, and although the fervent anti-establishment sentiments have faded, the mentality of struggle still resonates. The Beaux-Arts posters, on display through May 20, give a sense of the ferment of idealism, rebellion and rejection of the status quo that permeated French society and marked the second half of the 20th century. Some of the posters are easily comprehensible, but others need a little explanation. Here's a look at 11 of the most emblematic.

Police officers raided the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and forcibly expelled the students who had occupied it, turning the complex into a workshop. In this poster, a helmeted officer, complete with wolf-sharp teeth, grips a paintbrush in his mouth, a symbol of the police takeover of the school. The slogan plays on the French verb ""afficher,"" which means ""to display"" but in its reflexive form, ""s'afficher,"" means ""to show up."" The poster says: ""The police show up at the Beaux-Arts, the Beaux-Arts displays in the street.""","During the major strikes and student uprisings in France that year, the École des Beaux-Arts turned itself into a workshop for revolutionary messages.",1016796a-2a83-5a85-8763-88476717561c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/05/arts/05paris68-print/05paris68-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=4f8a28cf8d5230504417e143d4f854d3f33a51034e244efd5a08e08fa9e3b6d7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;Clash of Images,&rdquo; an exhibition in Paris of posters, paintings, films and other works from the uprising of May 1968 and beyond.",1016796a-2a83-5a85-8763-88476717561c,N24News/imgs/1016796a-2a83-5a85-8763-88476717561c.jpg,14
Real Estate,"In a Hot Climate, Rentals Shrink",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/22/realestate/in-a-hot-climate-rentals-in-new-york-city-shrink.html,"IF living in one of the 275-square-foot ""micro-units"" outlined by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg recently as part of an apartment design competition sounds unbearable, consider this: the size of new rentals in the city has been shrinking in recent years. While apartment units vary by neighborhood, the sweet spot for studios in new rental buildings is now ""close to 400 square feet,"" said Yuval Greenblatt, an executive vice president of Prudential Douglas Elliman, who has managed residential rentals for the past 15 years. ""Ten years ago,"" he added, ""they would build closer to 500 square feet wherever that could be achieved."" Condos haven't followed the same trajectory, with many developers building larger units to attract buyers. But rentals have been shrinking in order to keep monthly rents reasonable amid high demand, said David Sigman, an executive vice president of LCOR, an investment and development company. Zoning regulations in New York City require new apartments to have at least 400 square feet -- a constraint that has acted as a barrier to new housing possibilities. Those rules will be waived for the micro-apartments project, to be designed and built by the competition winner at a city-owned site in Kips Bay.

In new luxury rental buildings, space that would previously have been used for larger apartments is increasingly being devoted to shared amenities. At 34 Berry, a seven-story, 142-unit luxury rental building LCOR developed in Williamsburg, for example, more than 50 percent of the apartments are studios, ranging from 461 to 652 square feet. A shared lounge that residents can use if they start feeling claustrophobic features multiple flat-screen TVs, a catering kitchen, a billiards table and Nintendo Wii. Mikael Schulz, 36, and his partner, Claudio De Menezes, 43, who share a 466-square-foot studio at 34 Berry and pay about $2,200 a month in rent, don't have a television. When they want to watch TV or use the Internet, they treat the lounge as an extension of their apartment. For entertaining friends, there is a rooftop terrace with a barbecue grill and retro-style pod seating. With all the amenities, said Mr. Schulz, a fashion photographer who recently moved to New York from Sweden, ""you basically just need a nice, calm space to sleep and a kitchen."" Given that trend, many in the industry view Mayor Bloomberg's competition as a welcome challenge, and city officials hope to find a prototype for a new model of affordable, if tiny, housing. ""There are a lot of developers that would like to build units that are smaller,"" to cater to people who would like to have the opportunity to rent on their own instead of with roommates, said Andrew Gerringer, managing director of new business development for the Marketing Directors, a New York development, leasing and marketing company. ""A lot of people would like to have their own space, but they've been prevented."" Good design is key, said Evan Rosenfeld, a broker with Citi Habitats. ""The number is irrelevant. It's the layout that counts."" If the studio is well designed and in a desirable neighborhood, he said, ""a lot of times, people will sacrifice size."" Diminutive apartments have become something of an art form in other cities, including Tokyo and Hong Kong. New apartments in Tokyo can be as tiny as 193 square feet for single people, depending on the neighborhood, according to Azby Brown, the director of the KIT Future Design Institute in Tokyo and the author of ""The Very Small Home: Japanese ideas for living well in limited space.""

The famous Nakagin Capsule Tower in Tokyo, designed by Kisho Kurokawa and built in 1972, had apartments of about 107 square feet. ""These kinds of innovations are already happening"" in other cities, said Jerilyn Perine, the executive director of the nonprofit Citizens Housing and Planning Council in New York, which has been exploring new affordable housing ideas for the last three years through its Making Room project. ""Our power to innovate kind of has gotten stuck in a plethora of regulatory constraints. We need to be at the forefront of these things again."" The city hopes that rent for the micro-units in the pilot program will be below the current market value of $2,000 a month. Already, in its first week, the city's request for proposals has been downloaded more than 700 times from the Web site of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Real estate consultants caution that micro-units won't work in every market. But in places like Williamsburg, which attracts 20-somethings just out of school, or Bushwick's artist enclaves, ""these would do fabulous,"" said David J. Maundrell III, the founder of aptsandlofts.com, a New York brokerage firm that specializes in new-development marketing. To be sure, living in cramped quarters is a rite of passage for most New Yorkers. Plenty reside in apartments smaller than 400 square feet that were built before the current zoning rules went into effect. Stephenson Andrews, an architectural historian, lives with his partner in a 300-square-foot rent-stabilized Midtown East studio that includes a full bathroom, a compact kitchen and two closets. ""Would we like more room? Of course,"" he posted at nytimes.com/cityroom in response to an article about the micro-units contest, ""but it can and should be done. I've known too many people who have shared studio apartments in my three decades of being in NYC because they couldn't afford anything more and they would've loved their own space, however modest.""","The size of new rentals in New York City has been shrinking recently: These days 400 square feet is par for the course, down about 100 square feet from 10 years ago.",78675cee-8be5-5f64-8c3d-68f6f290918d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/22/realestate/22SMALL_SPAN/22SMALL_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=e584540758d99419412b83ad8cb919fb812070d3918a228779a9120b8646f350&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"TIGHT QUARTERS  Mikael Schulz, left, and Claudio De Menezes live in a 466-square-foot apartment at 34 Berry, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.",78675cee-8be5-5f64-8c3d-68f6f290918d,N24News/imgs/78675cee-8be5-5f64-8c3d-68f6f290918d.jpg,7
Theater,Can Derren Brown Be Fooled? Yes. Often.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/09/theater/derren-brown-secret.html,"Credit...Heather Sten for The New York Times





""Will you take a picture of my severed head?"" Derren Brown asked, dropping to his knees and angling himself behind a couple of trick mirrors that vanished him from the neck down. It was a recent sunny Saturday, and Mr. Brown had been wandering through the Museum of Illusions, an Instagram-friendly gallery housed in a former bank building in the West Village of Manhattan. His live show, ""Derren Brown: Secret,"" thrilled and flummoxed New Yorkers Off Broadway, two years ago. (Here's our co-chief theater critic: ""enthrallingly baffling."") It promises to thrill and flummox more of them at Broadway's Cort Theater, where it opens Sept. 15 . A sensation in his native England , Mr. Brown, 48, practices ""psychological illusionism."" What is psychological illusionism? ""I totally made that term up,"" he said. A mentalist , a magician, a hypnotist ( and a portraitist, photographer, best-selling author and television pioneer, it's annoying), he has made a career of tricking people, sometimes millions of them at once. Would ordinary optical effects trick him? Pretty often.

""Oh, that's very good,"" he said happily, as he watched a museum-goer (O.K., me) clown in an Ames Room, which makes you appear to grow or shrink as you walk from one corner to another. A wall sculpture whose straight rod seemed to curve got to him, too. ""It's nice to be really fooled,"" he said.

Not every illusion duped him. A wall card beside a poster of dots warned that, for 5 percent of people, the dots wouldn't waver. He was among the elect. And a Stroop Effect, which messes with neural processing, didn't rattle him. Still, he made faces at himself in a true mirror and staggered around a tilted room. He kidded in front of some spirals. He sauntered into a color-effect room, and his shadows bobbed behind him -- magenta, cyan, gold. He had arrived at the museum in a white shirt, a blue linen vest, summer-weight trousers and a jaunty straw hat, clothes more casual than the tailored suits he favors onstage. His shaved head made him look like an unusually handsome turtle. Even though he had dark circles under his eyes and seemed to need the espresso drink he later ordered at a cafe down the street, his affect was energetic, playful. He enjoyed effects even when he knew or could figure out just how they worked. Like that wall sculpture. ""Yes,"" he said as he stepped closer. ""Wow."" Mentalism or mind-reading is a storied form of magic. Depending on your parameters, you can trace it back thousands of years or about 150, when the act popped up in Victorian music halls. From one decade to the next, mentalists have claimed powers derived from mystery cults, from spirits, from E.S.P., from quantum physics. Mr. Brown doesn't do that.

His standard spiel for his stage shows promises ""magic, suggestion, psychology, misdirection and showmanship to achieve the seemingly impossible."" But figuring out which skills produce which effects is seemingly impossible, too. In ""Secret,"" which he wrote with Andy Nyman and Andrew O'Connor, also the show's directors, Mr. Brown attributes some tricks to a split-second analysis of nonverbal communication. Other of his shows swank his skills as a hypnotist. These powers are demonstrable and more or less real. But so is his sleight of hand. Here's how Mr. Nyman, a longtime collaborator, puts it: ""What Derren does is to use every single one of the things he's brilliant at to deceive, to misdirect, to entertain, to sincerely and deeply throw you in at the deep end."" Mentalism, like a lot of magic, can often appear hokey or, as Mr. O'Connor said, ""very uncool."" Mr. Brown mostly avoids this, which owes to his expertise, his charisma, his skillful improvisations and what Mr. Nyman calls an ""extraordinary sideways way of thinking."" Mr. Brown prefers risky versions of effects, which means that sequences can and do go wrong. (In an early show, when an audience volunteer had to choose between an empty box and a box that held 5,000 pounds, volunteers occasionally won the money.) And he tries, he said, to make sure that each show is ""about something else other than, 'Hey, look at me!'"" His live shows deploy illusion in service of a larger argument about perception or faith or belief. ""It's not really about the tricks,"" Mr. O'Connor said. ""He uses magic as a metaphor."" In ""Secret,"" which is, in many ways, a career best-of, the metaphors explore the way we see the world and the way the world sees us. A study in perspective, it is a reminder, as Mr. Brown says in the show, ""to be more open and alive to the complexity and subtlety of what's real."" Then again, considering the first-act cliffhanger and the jaw-dropper finale, what's real is fairly fungible.

How the world sees Mr. Brown depends on what part of the world you're in. His numerous BBC series have made him instantly recognizable in London, where he lives with his partner, their dogs and a lot of taxidermy . In New York, at the museum and at the cafe after, he could have been anyone. (Well, anyone with the confidence to pull off a linen vest.) He has broken into the American market only recently -- mostly through a few Netflix specials. But his collaborators had to talk him into a Broadway run. ""It literally took a long time to get him to agree,"" Mr. O'Connor said. ""He's not ambitious."" At the museum, Mr. Brown closed the door on an infinity room, and a world of Derren Browns appeared, each apparently able to read your mind. Each of whom might not want to. Because here's a funny thing about Mr. Brown. At this point in his career, magic doesn't interest him particularly. He sees a lot of it as childish, as an excuse to show off. In his stage acts and especially in his television specials, he has been moving toward sequences and effects that transform the participants in some psychological way rather than merely fool them. A decade from now, he might even give that up, he said. In the meantime, he has ""Secret"" to unveil and a new television special to prepare and a new stage show to work on, ""Showman,"" which tries to give as many audience members as possible a cathartic, life-changing experience. It sounded like a lot for a one-man magic act to achieve. ""Well, that's a good starting point,"" he said. ""Something that feels impossible.""","As one of the world's best magicians he'll fool you, too, even though magic isn't really his thing.",46f2c1ae-ede1-5050-b198-72c963af88b7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/15/arts/15derrenbrown3/15derrenbrown3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=978c874e04c51f3385a7af8f97a43bac94d7f61e1f90e824377adc7195bccd6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Derren Brown, at the Museum of Illusions in New York, is flashing his magical skills on Broadway.",46f2c1ae-ede1-5050-b198-72c963af88b7,N24News/imgs/46f2c1ae-ede1-5050-b198-72c963af88b7.jpg,10
Technology,SoFi Board Says C.E.O. Is Out Immediately Amid Sexual Harassment Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/technology/sofi-cagney-scandal.html,"Social Finance, a privately held online lender and technology start-up, said on Friday that Mike Cagney would step down immediately as chief executive, accelerating a departure announced this week amid a sexual harassment scandal. The board of the company, which is based in San Francisco and known as SoFi, said that Tom Hutton, the executive chairman, would be the interim chief executive and would take over day-to-day management responsibilities. Mr. Hutton, an initial SoFi investor, has been on the SoFi board since 2012. ""The business is strong, stable and well-positioned,"" Mr. Hutton said in a statement. ""For now, there is no more important work than paving the way for future success by building a transparent, respectful and accountable culture."" Mr. Cagney, 46, said in a letter on Monday that he would leave his position at the end of the year amid a sexual harassment lawsuit, accusations that he had inappropriate relationships with company employees and questions about whether he had skirted risk and compliance controls.

He did not respond to a request for comment. SoFi was founded in 2011 and bundles money from Wall Street investors into loans for students, home buyers and others. The company is valued at more than $4 billion and has raised $1.9 billion from venture investors, including Baseline Ventures, Discovery Capital and SoftBank. It recently began the process of applying for a banking license. SoFi was sued last month by a former employee who argued that sexual misconduct at the company had created a toxic work environment and that he had been fired for reporting sexual harassment to managers. SoFi disputed the accusations, but said it would investigate them.

Mr. Cagney said in the letter he sent to SoFi employees on Monday that ""the combination of HR-related litigation and negative press have become a distraction from the company's core mission."" On Tuesday, The New York Times published an article examining Mr. Cagney's stewardship of SoFi. The article included accusations from more than 30 current and former employees, who said he had treated women inappropriately and had aggressively taken on risk to accelerate the company's growth.

The article included details of a $75,000 settlement that SoFi reached with a former executive assistant at the company, Laura Munoz, who some people said had received sexually explicit text messages from Mr. Cagney. He was also seen holding hands and talking intimately with another female employee, which made employees uncomfortable. In addition, the article reported on a SoFi loan product that was sold to investors without being properly funded. The product was ultimately phased out, with investors being offered their money back or an opportunity to invest in a new product. They were not told about the funding shortfall. A SoFi spokesman told The Times for the article that the company had not taken on too much risk and that the board had investigated the dispute with Ms. Munoz in 2012 and had found no evidence of a romantic or sexual relationship. He declined to comment on other personal relationships involving Mr. Cagney and other employees, saying the company did not comment on personnel matters. The spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for additional comment on Friday. With Mr. Cagney's abrupt departure, SoFi joins the ranks of technology start-ups that have had to contend with serious issues related to workplace culture. Other companies in that category include the blood testing start-up Theranos, the insurance start-up Zenefits and, perhaps most prominently, the ride-hailing company Uber, whose chief executive, Travis Kalanick, stepped down amid a spate of scandals.

Health,"It's High Time for Ticks, Which Are Spreading Diseases Farther",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/health/ticks-disease-united-states.html,"Brian Kelly of East End Tick and Mosquito Control dragging for ticks. The company now routinely sprays lawns in addition to bushes because of the increased prevalence of more aggressive species of ticks.

SOUTHAMPTON, N.Y. -- This town is under siege from tiny invaders. A doctor at Southampton Hospital recently pulled a tick off a woman's eyeball. After a 10-minute walk outside, a mother reported finding a tick affixed to her 7-year-old daughter's buttocks. Another mother called the hospital in a ""hysterical state,"" according to the nurse who answered, because a tick had attached itself to her son's penis. Like many towns across the country, Southampton is seeing a tick population that is growing both in numbers and variety -- at a time when ticks are emerging as a significant public health danger. ""Tick-borne diseases are a very serious problem, and they're on the rise,"" said Rebecca Eisen, a research biologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""Even though you may live in an area where you didn't have ticks in the past or your parents don't remember having ticks, the distribution is changing,"" she added. ""More and more people are at risk."" With the expansion of the suburbs and a push to conserve wooded areas, deer and mice populations are thriving. They provide ample blood meals for ticks and help spread the pests to new regions. Originally from the Southeast, the lone star tick, for example, is heading north; it can now be found in 1,300 counties in 39 states. The blacklegged tick, also called the deer tick, is expanding its territory, too. In a recent study, Dr. Eisen reported a nearly 45 percent increase since 1998 in the number of counties with blacklegged ticks. Thomas Mather, director of the University of Rhode Island's TickEncounter Resource Center, said it used to get reports of three or four lone star ticks in the greater Chicago area each year. Now, it is receiving up to 15.

First, the species brings diseases from its original location. Second, the ticks pick up new pathogens from animals in their new ecosystem. Physicians and patients in a tick's new home may be less familiar with the diseases it carries. They can overlook symptoms or attribute them to a different cause, delaying effective treatment. The best known threat is Lyme disease. Cases in the United States increased from about 12,000 annually in 1995 to nearly 40,000 in 2015. Experts say the real number of infections is likely closer to 300,000. But scientists are finding ticks carry more than just Lyme: At least a third of known tick-borne pathogens were found in the last 20 years. Heartland virus and Bourbon virus, which can prove fatal, were discovered in just the last five years. Powassan virus, a rare but dangerous pathogen that can cause permanent brain damage or death, can be passed from tick to human in just 15 minutes. It was discovered in 1958, and an average of seven cases are reported each year. Earlier this month, a resident of Saratoga County, N.Y., who had Powassan disease died. Dr. Gary Wormser, founder of the Lyme Disease Diagnostic Center at New York Medical College, said the most worrisome tick-borne contagion he sees is babesiosis, which can cause malaria-like symptoms and require hospitalization. A few of his patients have died from it; several required intensive care.

Before 2001, babesiosis was not found in Westchester, N.Y. But Westchester Medical Center has diagnosed at least 21 cases in the past year. A study of babesiosis in Wisconsin found a 26-fold increase in the number of cases between 2001 to 2003, and 2012 to 2015. In places where the lone star tick is gaining prevalence, doctors also are seeing an increase in cases of alpha-gal syndrome, a strange allergy to red meat induced by tick bites. Alpha-gal is a sugar molecule carried by the lone star tick. When the tick bites a human, it activates the immune system, which starts producing alpha-gal antibodies. The body becomes wired to fight alpha-gal sugar molecules, which are abundant in red meat. Eating meat can trigger allergic reactions, from an itchy rash to anaphylactic shock.

Dr. Erin McGintee, an allergist and immunologist at ENT and Allergy Associates in Southampton, sees two to three cases of alpha-gal syndrome per week during tick season. Since diagnosing her first case in October 2010, she has seen more than 380 patients. ""The cases are definitely increasing over time,"" she said. That is no surprise to Karen Wulffraat, administrative director of Southampton Hospital's Tick-Borne Disease Resource Center.

""People can walk across their lawn barefoot to get the newspaper and get a tick,"" he said. As human exposure to ticks continues to increase, it's likely that even the rarest infections they carry will become more common, Dr. Goddard said. ""This really has a human toll that a lot of people don't recognize,"" he said.",The disease-carrying blood suckers are spreading more pathogens and putting more Americans at risk for rare illnesses.,924606d3-3708-585e-96fb-ae424a1e9299,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/25/science/25TICKJP2/25TICKJP2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=740074bd64ba127f9bd9319e6b5ac6c6c2280610156b399cf3a9eb3bf604988d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A lone star tick shows a white spot on its back as seen under a magnifying glass from a tick kit from the Southampton Hospital Tick-Borne Disease Resource Center.,924606d3-3708-585e-96fb-ae424a1e9299,N24News/imgs/924606d3-3708-585e-96fb-ae424a1e9299.jpg,1
Real Estate,"In the High-Flying Hamptons, Real Estate Is in a Rut",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/realestate/in-the-high-flying-hamptons-real-estate-is-in-a-rut.html,"David and Sindhu Nordquist deliberated for years about where to buy a second home, and then last summer, while renting a house in the Hamptons for the first time, they decided to find a place on the East End of Long Island to call their own. ""We just loved it, and all our friends and family loved it,"" said Mr. Nordquist, 51, a retired financier from Manhattan. ""It had to be here, and it had to be now."" With Timothy O'Connor, an agent at Halstead, the Nordquists looked at more than 60 listings, searching for ""a beach house in the woods,"" Mr. Nordquist said. ""We wanted privacy and didn't want neighbors around us.""

""We negotiated pretty hard on the price,"" Mr. Nordquist said. ""I bargained a lot. I felt the market was softening."" As Aspasia G. Comnas, the executive managing director of Brown Harris Stevens, observed, ""Sellers in the Hamptons are used to the market always going up every year, and if they priced aggressively it didn't matter."" But in today's market, homes that are not priced competitively ""are going to have to go through a series of price reductions"" before they sell, she said -- at all levels of the market, not just at the high end.

Buyers seem to be staying on the sidelines. The number of single-family homes on the market during the first three months of 2019 was nearly double that of a year earlier: 2,327, up from 1,201. And sales of single-family homes have dropped, to 287 from 350 in 2018. One thing making buyers hesitate, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel and the author of the Douglas Elliman report, is the new federal tax code approved by Congress in late 2017, which makes it more expensive to own luxury property because homeowners can deduct only up to $10,000 in state and local taxes from their federal income taxes. ""The Hamptons are trending much like the New York City metro area,"" Mr. Miller said, noting that the situation is similar in other parts of the Northeast and in California, where real estate is pricey and property taxes are high.

""The slowdown in sales represents the disconnect between sellers, who are anchored to better times, and buyers, who have a lot of changes to process,"" Mr. Miller said. Any sense of urgency was further quelled by the ""intense volatility of the financial markets at the end of last year, along with the close linkage of Wall Street to the Hamptons,"" he added. A 17 percent dip in bonuses in the finance industry in 2018 likely also discouraged Wall Street workers from buying second homes in the Hamptons. The average bonus for financial market employees in 2017 was $184,400; in 2018, it dropped to $153,700, according to a report from the New York State Comptroller.

Those who did buy, though, found bargains. Figuring it didn't hurt to look, Maria and Stephen Zak, of Saddle River, N.J., toured a 2007 harbor-front house with four bedrooms, four and a half bathrooms, a heated pool and a hot tub, on an acre in East Hampton, listed for $3.2 million. ""We loved it, but it was way out of our budget,"" said Mr. Zak, 53, the chief financial officer of a boutique investment bank. They had been looking for a second home for about a year. The price of the 3,400-square-foot house had already been reduced from the original 2017 asking price of $3.995 million. So ""we threw out an offer we were comfortable with,"" Mr. Zak said. And in November, the Zaks closed on the house, for $2.735 million.

""It's like the dog that chases the car and actually catches it,"" Mr. Zak said. ""It's still not cheap, but it was fair and it was in move-in condition."" They have since installed a new kitchen, painted and brought in new rugs. In the shifting luxury real estate market, the highest priced homes are taking longer to sell, said Laura Brady, the president and founder of Concierge Auctions, in Manhattan. The company's Luxury Homes Index report, released earlier this month, noted that the 10 most expensive homes sold in the Hamptons last year had an average sale price of $24,079,286, and spent an average of 706.7 days on the market. Luxury homes that lingered on the market tended to go for less, selling at discounts of nearly 40 percent after six months, Ms. Brady said. In Montauk, the 20-acre oceanfront estate that belongs to Dick Cavett, the former talk show host, has been on the market for two years. The 7,000-square-foot, six-bedroom, four-bathroom house, which was listed for $62 million in June 2017, was designed by McKim, Mead & White in the 1880s and rebuilt in 1997 after a fire, using ""forensic architecture techniques"" to replicate the original house with a wraparound porch and a bell tower, said Gary DePersia, an associate broker with Corcoran. The price dropped to $48.5 million last August, then Mr. DePersia re-listed it in February, for $33.95 million. ""They are motivated sellers,"" Mr. DePersia said. ""Where are you going to get 20 acres with 900 feet of oceanfront and utter privacy with a historic house for that kind of money in the Hamptons? You are not.""

According to a first quarter report from Bespoke Real Estate, which deals exclusively with $10 million-plus properties, 122 homes priced over $10 million were on the market at the end of March, with 13 between $30 and $40 million. Most $10 million-plus buyers already have a home in the Hamptons, said Zachary Vichinsky, a principal at Bespoke Real Estate, and have spent ""in some cases the better part of two years exploring the market and defining what works best for them,"" whether that means upgrading or building a new home closer to the water. ""There is a lack of urgency on their part, in a lot of cases, but the special inventory continues to move pretty quickly,"" Mr. Vichinsky said. In 2018, a total of 41 homes sold for $10 million or more in areas that brokers refer to as the ""alpha market,"" which includes East Hampton, Southampton, Water Mill, Bridgehampton, Sagaponack and Wainscott. But there was one bright spot in the market overall: homes listed for $500,000 to $1 million. That sector of the market accounted for 34 percent of sales in the first quarter, according to a report from Brown Harris Stevens.

Mr. Baltimore scraped paint off beams and gave his new Hamptons home ""a nip and a tuck, to get it summer-ready,"" he said, adding that eventually he plans to renovate more extensively. ""Finding potential wasn't easy,"" Mr. Baltimore said. ""You have to look at a lot of what's out there to see where the value is. You have to kiss a lot of frogs.""","With inventory up and prices down, a persistent buyer can negotiate a great deal.",4a5d8669-b230-59ab-85c0-394ab834be83,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/19/realestate/17HAMPTONS-slide-I6EF/17HAMPTONS-slide-I6EF-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8181729531089892a3d7cdded9723ac8945cb6355e2e6e55596cb302c1f8f471&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Top, a 3,300-square-foot home in Sag Harbor, N.Y., was originally listed for $1.825 million, but with the market softening, David and Sindhu Nordquist were able to buy it for $1.35 million.",4a5d8669-b230-59ab-85c0-394ab834be83,N24News/imgs/4a5d8669-b230-59ab-85c0-394ab834be83.jpg,7
Global Business,"Innovation, by Order of the Kremlin",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/11/business/global/11russia.html,"AROUND the time that Apple Computer was making it big in California, Andrey Shtorkh was getting a first-hand look at the Soviet approach to high tech: he guarded the fence keeping scientists inside Sverdlovsk-45, one of the country's secret scientific cities, deep in the Ural Mountains. Ostensibly, the cities were closed to guard against spies. Its walls also kept scientists inside, and everybody else in the Soviet Union out. While many people in the country went hungry, the scientific centers were islands of well-being, where store shelves groaned with imported food and other goodies. Security in these scientific islands was so tight, though, that even children wore badges. Relatives had to apply months in advance for permission to visit. ""It was a prison, a closed city in every sense,"" recalls Mr. Shtorkh, then a young soldier. Today, he is the publicist for an improbable new venture. The Russian government, hoping to diversify its economy away from oil, is building the first new scientific city since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Even more improbably, it is modeled, officials say, on Silicon Valley.

The site, still nameless and near a village outside Moscow, is conceived not as a secretive, numbered city in Siberia but as an attempt to duplicate the vibrancy and entrepreneurial spirit of America's technology hotbed. Russia's rich scientific traditions and poor record of converting ideas into marketable products are both undisputed, cited as causes for the Soviet collapse and crippling dependence on mining and petroleum. Not surprisingly, then, its leaders look longingly at Silicon Valley. ""The whole country needs some sort of breakthrough,"" Viktor F. Vekselberg, the Russian business oligarch appointed co-director of the project, said in an interview. Mr. Vekselberg was chosen in part because of his investments in solar power, an unusual venture for one of the oligarchs who made fortunes in commodities. ""The founding of the innovation city, in form and substance,"" he says, ""could be a launching pad for the country as a whole."" He calls the city ""a test run of business models"" to rebuild Russian science for the capitalist era. Once developed, the site is intended to incubate scientific ideas using generous tax holidays and government grants until the start-ups can become profitable companies. Its backers in government and the private sector describe it as an effort to blend the Soviet tradition of forming scientific towns with Western models of encouraging technology ventures around universities.

Skeptics see a deeper strain of Russian tradition: trying to catch up with the West by wielding the power of the state. Looking askance at the incongruous blend of the Kremlin's will and the openness prized by Silicon Valley, they refer jokingly to the new city as Cupertino-2. A Russian Silicon Valley is being built from scratch. Viktor Vekselberg will be co-director of the project. ""We should not expect the same mechanisms that work in Silicon Valley to work in Russia,"" says Evgeny V. Zaytsev, a co-founder of Helix Ventures, a life sciences venture capital company based in Palo Alto, Calif., and a member of the advisory board of AmBar, the Russian business association in the real Silicon Valley. ""The government will be involved, because that is the way it works in Russia."" Indeed, the new city was conceived by what is called the Commission on Modernization, deep within the Kremlin bureaucracy. The Russian government, though, has a long and conflicted relationship with entrepreneurs and scientists. There is still a thriving tradition of government crackdowns on private business with capricious enforcement of the tax laws, making entrepreneurship difficult. For now, Russia's hoped-for Silicon Valley is a panorama of muddy fields, birch groves, warehouses and storage sheds belonging to a state agricultural institute. The site was chosen for its proximity to another ambitious project, the Skolkovo business school, housed in a futuristic building financed by millions in donations from the oligarchs, including Mr. Vekselberg. While similar ideas have been bandied about for years, this one was approved -- and blessed with $200 million in government money -- within a month of a visit in January to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology by senior Kremlin leaders, including Vladislav Surkov, the powerful deputy director of the presidential administration. Mr. Surkov says the new city will isolate new businesses from the bureaucracy that handcuffs the Russian economy today.

A government-financed foundation will build and run the city. Directors of existing state-financed tech companies -- including Rusnano, a nanotechnology fund headed by Anatoly Chubais, a leading architect of Russia's controversial post-Soviet privatization -- will serve on the board and contribute money. Separately, a scientific council will decide which companies can locate at the site. The infrastructure should be in place within three years, Mr. Vekselberg says. Mr. Zaytsev grew up in the Siberian city of Barnaul, got an M.B.A. at Stanford and worked for venture capital firms before founding his own. He approves of the experimental spirit of the new city. But he is skeptical that bureaucrats will be able to channel the money in ways that will transform Russia into a competitive force in consumer technology. Rusnano and the other state-financed venture businesses have had few successes thus far. ""The less control, the better,"" Mr. Zaytsev says. If the government ""controls the venture funds, no real venture funds will come."" FOR a time, the Russian elite embraced petroleum as the ticket to restore the country's domestic economy, its standing in the world and its power in regional politics. Vladimir V. Putin, then the president, took to citing the stock price of Gazprom as a national accomplishment. But Gazprom, a company that inherited title to the world's largest natural gas reserves, is now valued by investors at well below Apple, a company that sprang from a garage. Indeed, the Kremlin's sensitivity to its trailing position in the wired world was on full display this year at the World Economic Forum, in Davos, Switzerland. Mr. Putin, now the prime minister, and Michael S. Dell found themselves on the same discussion panel, and Mr. Dell asked in passing how he might help Russia develop its information technology sector. The scientific city will be near the Skolkovo business school, which received millions in donations from Russia's business oligarchs. James Hill for The New York Times Mr. Putin answered icily: ""We don't need help. We are not invalids. We don't have limited mental capacity.""

For nationalistic Russian officials, it only rubs salt in the wounds that Silicon Valley companies so easily recruit bright Russian scientists. AmBar, the Russian business association, estimates that 30,000 to 60,000 Russian-speaking professionals work in the San Francisco Bay Area. A marquee name in the high-tech world, the Google co-founder Sergei Brin, immigrated to the United States from Russia with his parents when he was a child. Had Russia been a different place, perhaps Mr. Brin might have started Google there instead of in Silicon Valley. Russia is hardly the first country to seize on the idea of copying Silicon Valley. In Malaysia, for example, a jungle has been cleared for a computer city called Cyberjaya that is a self-declared effort to imitate the south Bay Area. China has a cluster of high tech in Tianjin, outside Beijing, and France in Sophia Antipolis, near Nice, all created with an infusion of government aid -- and all eventually successful in attracting and fostering private business. In the midst of the oil boom, Russian officials suggested luring back Russian talent by building a gated residential community outside Moscow, designed to look like an American suburb. What is it about life in Palo Alto, they seemed to be asking, that we cannot duplicate in oil-rich Russia? The new effort, though, goes well beyond good housing. It also embraced the idea of encouraging new companies to commercialize the work done at university laboratories. Russian officials looked at Asian techno-parks with favorable tax treatment and established four of their own -- in Tomsk, Dubna, Zelenograd and St. Petersburg. Three were based in former closed scientific cities.

The visions for Russia's Silicon Valley, though, are grander still. A proposed law would liberalize a host of tax, customs and immigration rules in ways that businesses have wanted for years. For example, the planners say they have studied the role of streamlined immigration rules in drawing talent to Silicon Valley. President Dmitri A. Medvedev appointed Mr. Vekselberg the co-director of the project, a position that will probably evolve into one of two directors of the foundation to manage the new city. As a first order of business, he is to recruit a foreign businessman to co-direct the city with him; he has so far sent out about 100 letters to foreign business contacts who are potential candidates. For now, his own money is not tied up in the site. But Mr. Vekselberg's Renova group, whose primary assets are in metals and oil, has a significant investment in solar energy through a 44 percent stake in Oerlikon, a thin-film solar panel maker based in Switzerland. Mr. Vekselberg said he was surprised by his appointment but is now a true believer in the project and would like to attract a mix of start-ups, established companies and academic institutions. Mr. Medvedev, in a televised meeting about the new city, emphasized commercialization: ""The new technologies which we are creating are not toys for eggheads,"" he said. The new town is intended to advance five scientific priorities laid out by Mr. Medvedev -- communications, biomedicine, space, nuclear power and energy conservation -- and to encourage cross-fertilization among disciplines. Property will not be owned, but rented, and the government will offer grants for scientists who struggle to find private financing. ""In California, the climate is beautiful and they don't have the ridiculous problems of Russia,"" Mr. Shtorkh said. To compete, he said, Russia will form a place apart for scientists. ""They should be isolated from our reality,"" he added.

Officials have painted the Russian Silicon Valley in sweeping ideological terms. Russia, they say, will again be defined by the depth of its scientific talent, rather than by its mines and wells. The government has appointed as scientific director a Nobel laureate in physics, Zhores Alferov -- whose discoveries in the 1950s were cited by the Nobel committee as paving the way for cellphones (which the Soviet Union, incidentally, never made). HIGH-TECH entrepreneurs who stayed in Russia are more skeptical. Yevgeny Kaspersky, founder of the Kaspersky Lab, an antivirus company, says that he is pulling for the site to succeed but that the government should confine its role to offering tax breaks and infrastructure. He started his own business in Moscow in the 1990s, working nights on his hobby of capturing and studying computer viruses, but he benefited from a special economic zone for start-ups only when he opened an office in Tianjin in 2003. The Chinese government gave him free office space for a year and a tax holiday. ""Russia has a lot of talented software engineers but not a lot of successful businesses,"" he said. ""People still have an iron curtain in their minds."" The old scientific cities were entangled with the military, but they also reflected futuristic and utopian strains in Soviet thinking. Isolating scientists in Siberian enclaves -- removed from the struggle for groceries that defined many other citizens' lives -- and provisioning them with laboratories yielded results in the Soviet nuclear weapons and space programs. With talented, low-cost work forces, the cities remain attractive, even to foreign investors: I.B.M., Intel and others have opened offices and labs in formerly closed Russian cities. The problem, critics say, is that the government today intends to corral Russian engineers and scientists without knowing what it wants. The model, instead, should be maximum exposure to competition and the vagaries of consumer demand. ""They don't understand what they need,"" said an adviser to the Kremlin, who was not authorized to speak publicly. ""They don't need another atomic bomb, and they don't need new televisions.""

The planners, meanwhile, are looking for a name. One suggestion was ""Innograd,"" for Innovation City, echoing with a self-deprecating humor the boisterous Soviet nomenclature for new ventures like ""Magnitogorsk,"" or Magnetic Mountain -- the name given to a gigantic steel mill in the Ural Mountains. Another option was ""Gorod Solntsa"" or Sun City, a reference to the nearby Moscow neighborhood of Solntsovo. This suggestion, though, may undermine the idea of turning a new page, as Solntsovo is also the name of a famous organized-crime group from the 1990s that got its start in the area. Mr. Shtorkh, the former closed-city guard, prefers an Apple-esque iteration: iGorod.",The Russian government is building the first new scientific city since the collapse of the Soviet Union — and it is to be modeled on Silicon Valley.,069d8600-a0f7-5f57-9329-f098494f9fa2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/04/11/business/11russia_CA1/11russia_CA1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=316593c45d5268a1751f52c9e233efde7006a7aa942a4e61b8d0587e37915641&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Yevgeny Kaspersky, a technology entrepreneur, wants the scientific city to succeed but says the state's role should be limited to offering tax breaks and infrastructure.",069d8600-a0f7-5f57-9329-f098494f9fa2,N24News/imgs/069d8600-a0f7-5f57-9329-f098494f9fa2.jpg,24
Movies,What Is a Grip? The Few Women Doing the Job in Hollywood Explain,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/10/movies/key-grips-explainer.html,"A recent report hardly painted a rosy picture of the gender balance in Hollywood: Just 4 percent of the top 1,200 movies from the last 12 years had been directed by women. Deep in the report, another jarring figure leapt out at me. Looking at the most lucrative films from 2016 to 2018, researchers found that just four of the 276 key grips working on those films were women. A few questions popped to mind. Who were these women? What are their work lives like? And what exactly are key grips? The researchers, at the University of Southern California, provided the names of a female key grip and a few female best boy grips, who, as their head-scratcher job titles suggest, are also a rarity in the business: Of the 274 best boy grips on the top films from the last three years, only eight were women. Names in hand, it was up to me to track them down. Through Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook and an obscure production job-posting site -- and with the help of New York Times researchers -- I reached four women: a key grip, whose job is to head the grip department, and three best boy grips, who are second in command. My first question was about what they do. ""We control anything over people's heads,"" explained Tana Dubbe, 59, a key grip whose credits include ""Iron Man,"" ""Straight Outta Compton"" and ""A Star Is Born."" ""We're mini-engineers on the fly.""

Grips build platforms, set up rigging and the equipment that shapes and diffuses lighting, mount cameras onto cars and cranes onto buildings, and schlep 35-pound sandbags known as ballbusters. Twelve-hour days are considered short, and injuries are inevitable. The women I interviewed have cracked their kneecaps, fractured their feet, torn their rotator cuffs, developed early arthritis and wrenched their backs. But gripping also offers a solid, middle-class life. Depending on the city and the frequency of work, grips can earn salaries in the low six figures, with key grips potentially earning more than double that, especially if they have their own gear and trucks to rent out. Besides being overwhelmingly male, the profession is often handed down through families, and there are third- and fourth-generation grips, or ""hammers,"" as they are known in the business. The women I spoke with said many of their male colleagues were supportive, while others heckled them or worse. ""It's not for the faint of heart,"" said Melanie A. Ragone, whose credits include ""The Walking Dead"" and ""Love, Simon."" But, she added, the job was also deeply rewarding, because it involves behind-the-scenes problem solving. ""It sounds kind of corny,"" she said, ""but grips are the unsung heroes on set."" Here they explain more about the job and what it's like to be one of the few women doing it: Dubbe knows exactly one female key grip in Hollywood: herself. She is sure others are out there, she just hasn't met them yet. Dubbe grew up building forts and later found herself drawn to jobs not traditionally occupied by women: logging, construction. She majored in printmaking and painting at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, and got her start in gripping after assisting the photographer Eddie Adams.

Dubbe loved the interplay of planning, building and fixing even though, she said, ""there was not another chick to be seen."" There have been male crew members over the years who doubted her decisions, and people on sets who assumed she was there to do hair, makeup or wardrobe. Dubbe said she stayed unruffled. ""I have almost zero ego, and that makes working in a team situation very different for the fellas that work with me as well,"" she said. ""We come to conclusions together, and I really respect their opinions."" Her first key-grip credit was ""Never Die Alone,"" and she has been in demand ever since, most recently finishing up the untitled movie about Roger Ailes with Charlize Theron, and then immediately starting ""Birds of Prey,"" starring Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn. Her job, she said, involves solving ""a million little math problems all day,"" and occasionally calling in a structural engineer to ask about, say, the tensile strength of a 100-year-old floor. ""I'm the connective tissue between the desire and the making,"" Dubbe said. She is surprised that more women do not end up as grips or key grips, and suspects it is because the job has the reputation of being all about brute force, when it is often about being nimble. ""The grips have a stigma, the all-boys club,"" she said. ""I'm here to tell you it ain't true.""

Ragone, 43, never really got used to the trash talk she heard on sets from some guys, who commented on her figure, or who took one look at her and questioned how she could ever do the job. Her response was all defiance. ""I'm going to run circles around you,"" she would silently vow. ""And that's exactly what I did."" She got into gripping after moving to Atlanta to finish film school at the Art Institute of Atlanta. A guy who hired her on Craigslist to shoot wedding videos told her that she should join the union and become a grip. She started as a production assistant, hated the minutiae, and decided she would rather set up gear. She was good with her hands and always tinkering with stuff. She never did finish her degree, but she found a calling on sets. ""Grips were more like my people, a bunch of cool guys who fix things,"" she said. With every new job, she felt she had to prove herself because she was a woman, and it only made her work harder. Whenever women ask about getting into the field, Ragone tells them to go to the gym, get ripped and develop a thick skin. ""Because you're going to be tested,"" she said. Beyond verbal badgering, she was physically sexually harassed once, when a male crew member who had been hired for the day slapped her behind as he was walking past. Ragone was stunned. She confronted the man, who apologized, and told the line producer, who immediately fired him. In 2019, after eight years of gripping in Atlanta, Ragone moved to Los Angeles to try to break into writing and directing. ""I feel like I went to school for the last eight years,"" she said, ""Real school on set.""

""If it wasn't for him,"" she said of Miller, ""I would have probably just quit."" Her early jobs were hit or miss. Sometimes the crew guys -- they were always guys -- were helpful and supportive, like the ones she worked with on ""Boardwalk Empire and ""Blue Bloods."" Others excluded her from group lunches, told her to sit in the corner, or ignored her outright. On one job, a fellow grip asked if the new cornrows in her hair meant she had joined the Crips or the Bloods. ""Yeah,"" Alexis remembers replying dryly. ""I decided to become a gang member overnight."" Some directors assumed she was a production assistant, and asked her to fetch food. She also suffered routine job injuries, including multiple foot fractures and a torn rotator cuff. But she found deep support from her local union; when she had bad experiences, she said, they worked to find her better jobs. Her first big union movie was ""Noah,"" the 2014 Darren Aronofsky epic. Even though she went to work everyday afraid of being fired for her inexpertise, the crew liked that she was eager to learn. In short order, Alexis became an adroit fork lift driver, which is handy on a set with biblical demands. In recent years, Alexis, 37, found her crew ""family,"" which includes Lamont Crawford, who regularly works with Spike Lee, and is the only black key grip Alexis knows; they worked together on ""BlacKkKlansman."" She also started her own production company, Sweet Alexis Productions, writing scripts, and it has helped steady her when the job gets rough. ""A lot of times there is still racism, I am not going to lie,"" she said, ""Sexism also happens. But you're outnumbered.""

Early in her career, she said she had mentors who were endlessly kind and patient; the only time she felt she was different was when she applied to join the union, and got the cold shoulder from male union members who resented a nonunion colleague. ""In an industry where it wasn't that busy as was now, everybody was a little scared to lose jobs,"" she said. Vancouver is still a booming film hub. When she started, she knew fewer than 10 women doing the same job. Now she estimates there are upward of 40. On one recent show she worked on, ""Lost in Space,"" a third of the 18 grips were women. Beaupre's aim now is to become a key grip. There isn't a female one in Vancouver working full time as far as she knows.","On a movie set ""we control anything over people's heads,"" one female key grip explains. But when you're the exception on an all-male crew, other factors come into play.",61159010-cbdd-5f2a-aede-026fbac964e8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/arts/14female-grips1/14femaly-grips1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b3fc17b421505f0d4532ff5013afdcca8ad7118d4b98b15c8edb5bc703303acf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tana Dubbe at home in California.

Movies,"'Blowin' Up' Review: In a Queens Courtroom, Humanity Prevails",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/movies/blowin-up-review.html,"Filming from 2015 to early 2017, Wang-Breal and her cinematographer, Erik Shirai, immerse us in the cheery bustle of the courtroom and the busy hallways outside. Discreetly eavesdropping on counseling sessions as clients divulge often heartbreaking personal details, the filmmakers eschew narration in favor of a more fragmented, naturalistic approach.

This can be as frustrating as it is fascinating. Yet ""Blowin' Up"" (the term is used to describe the act of leaving a pimp) suggests that, in a compassionate society, this is what justice would look like -- a hopeful tone that's ultimately tempered as the Trump presidency begins and ICE starts to apprehend clients.

""It's just too big,"" one weary counselor says of the trafficking business that claims so many victims. ""It's too big.""","Stephanie Wang-Breal's fascinating documentary highlights a program in Queens that treats prostitutes as victims, not criminals.",23a21992-8ed0-5168-8800-5770ca197128,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/arts/blowin1/merlin_152973909_09c03051-7caf-45f4-8999-9e174bc49d80-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e5e1cf2f9f62bf36e7e799f249fcc0acc58c1ccf96bee5ffbfe5ce038a0f84e1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kandie in Stephanie Wang-Breal's documentary ""Blowin' Up.""",23a21992-8ed0-5168-8800-5770ca197128,N24News/imgs/23a21992-8ed0-5168-8800-5770ca197128.jpg,5
Theater,"And in the Next Zoom Room, a Rat Doing a Striptease",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/05/theater/eschaton-immersive-nightclub.html,"And in the Next Zoom Room, a Rat Doing a Striptease

On a recent Saturday, I joined a few hundred people for a wild night at a singularly outrageous nightclub. Each room contained something different and unexpected. In one, a girl strummed a viola and told dirty jokes; next door, a giant rat performed a striptease to the soundtrack of a lecture on Taoism. There was a cooking tutorial, a magician doing card tricks, a burlesque performer contorting on a chaise longue. It was ""Eschaton"": part theater, part nightlife simulator, part Chatroulette, taking place Saturday nights on Zoom. It conveys the illusion of being a maze of interconnected rooms, even though all of its performers are livestreaming their disparate, usually solo contributions from their homes. Audience members, tuning in remotely, are encouraged to dress glamorously, dim the lights, and pour themselves a drink. (I gladly did two out of three.) You can keep your webcam on or off, though allowing yourself to be spied on feels truer to the show's air of cheeky voyeurism. For an hour, you can interact with performers, piece together a jigsaw puzzle of a story, and crack a ""Clue""-like whodunit, if you can even first figure out what they dun.

By early March, the show had been in development for seven months. Whitehead had written five crisscrossing scripts, Blum was investigating real estate options, and the cast was raring to go, ready to play the tortured denizens of a purgatorial nightclub. The title, ""Eschaton,"" a fancy theological term for the end of the world, fits the broad theme: the performer's existential need for an audience, and the precariousness of a life in the spotlight. Then the pandemic issued an all-too-real reminder of that precariousness. ""We had to cancel our first table read, and for a week, as we watched 'Sleep No More' close and Broadway shut down, we weren't sure immersive theater would exist anymore,"" Whitehead said. ""And if it did, what it would look like.""

But after a couple of weeks, while the creative team was quarantined on different coasts (Whitehead in Brooklyn, Blum in San Francisco), they began to wonder what a virtual version of the show might look like. Would it be possible to translate the spirit of immersive theater -- a form that gets an extra charge from its feeling of unboundedness and the proximity between performer and audience -- to the strict confines of a computer screen? ""During quarantine, we felt that audiences needed that type of entertainment, a world they could get lost in and escape the reality they're in,"" Blum said. ""We simply met the audience where they were: online."" They enlisted the ""Sleep No More"" performer Taylor Myers as director and the tech studio BENBENBEN, which has lately been helping businesses pivot to virtual spaces. They created a digital lobby -- actually, a password-protected website accessible only to ticket buyers -- and drew on additional inspirations, such as video games, alternate reality games and online escape rooms. ""We had no idea how long quarantine was going to last,"" Whitehead said, ""so we gave ourselves two weeks to put something together."" They redirected what would have been their real estate budget into recruiting and paying as many performers, and as many kinds of performers, as possible. The cast grew from five to 26, with several alumni from ""Sleep No More"" and ""Then She Fell"" joining the ranks. For obvious reasons, the performers are also their own costumers, lighting and scenic designers, prop masters, makeup artists, musical directors and cinematographers.

""It can feel lonely to set your own stage,"" said Mallory Gracenin, a fan-favorite ""Sleep No More"" performer, who serves as one of the ""Eschaton"" hosts. ""But for a while, I didn't believe that I could be a working artist. So I'm tickled to get to do this every week."" Since ""Eschaton"" began weekly performances as a work-in-progress, Gracenin has perfected the art of making intimate ""eye contact"" with the audience in her Zoom room, peering meaningfully and batting her lashes at her camera lens rather than at her screen. On the night of my visit, an audience member in London confessed to Gracenin that life had been really difficult lately; the show has become a hub for devotees of immersive entertainment, some from as far away as Germany, Japan or Spain. ""You might not feel the breath in the room,"" Gracenin said. ""But you know when what you're doing is working. You can still feel connected within this virtual, immersive world."" The world of ""Eschaton"" continues to morph and grow from week to week. It's sprawling enough now to get hopelessly lost in, with several rooms arranged across three floors and a basement. (Before specializing in immersive experiences, Jae Lee, the show's game designer and co-producer, studied and worked as an architect.) A stage manager and a crew of assistants lurk in the margins, providing tech support as well as nudging guests toward secrets and surprises.

And Whitehead has kept writing, weaving in more intricate narrative threads for the audience to either untangle or get tangled up in. At $10 a ticket, the creators hope some guests might even be inclined to come back for more, thinking of the experience as something like episodic appointment television. ""Each week there's more to discover, more drama to be mined,"" Whitehead said. There have been one-off delights, too. At least one audience member had a pizza delivery turn up on her real-world doorstep. And there are still more ideas the creators want to experiment with. ""It's almost like we've stumbled upon a new genre of live entertainment,"" Whitehead said. Gracenin hopes that, even when theaters open up again, ""Eschaton"" will carry on -- perhaps virtually as well as physically. But she's looking forward to a time when performers and audiences can coexist in the flesh. ""It's going to be really nice to hug a fellow performer,"" she said.","""Eschaton"" was meant to be an in-person immersive experience. But its creators have pivoted to invite audiences to visit the ""nightclub"" virtually instead.",90f9b6f0-a03f-5e9a-86f3-1589de6089de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/06/arts/05eschaton-6/05eschaton-6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=743c6d232a2203343b5f48b320cf52b2c8aac8b2a4d34d5a6acd89de1505a201&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The actor and vocalist Kuhoo Verma, greeting visitors in the immersive digital show &ldquo;Eschaton.&rdquo;",90f9b6f0-a03f-5e9a-86f3-1589de6089de,N24News/imgs/90f9b6f0-a03f-5e9a-86f3-1589de6089de.jpg,10
Travel,A Shopper's Guide to Asian Treasures,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/22/travel/a-shoppers-guide-to-asia.html,"The best things in life may be free -- if the lyrics from the 1927 musical ""Good News"" are to be believed -- but few people can resist the siren song of shopping.

That's not necessarily problematic if you're on a Costco spree and have a minivan in the lot, but when traveling in Asia it's wise to be discerning -- if only to avoid baggage fees. To help winnow your shopping list I consulted veteran travel and hospitality experts from Tokyo to Bangkok and asked them to name their one must-have souvenir. Below, a guide composed of their picks, some of which may surprise you, and where to snap them up.

What: The Non La, the palm-leaf conical hat, is perhaps the most common tourist must-have, said Sandy Ferguson, the owner of Asia Desk, a travel consultancy and tour company, who has seen his fair share of visitors ""schlepping them on airplanes."" And should you have your heart set on one, he said the Ben Thanh Market in Ho Chi Minh City is the best place to buy. But Mr. Ferguson, who grew up in Asia and was one of the first travel professionals working in Vietnam in the 1980s, said his favorite souvenir is handmade Vietnamese silk embroidery. ""These are people who sit on one piece for a month and a half,"" he said of the artisans who produce the silk embroidery, adding that he's particularly fond of the double-sided artworks. ""It is very easy to carry folded up to get framed back home."" If you're intrigued, he suggests checking out the textiles from XQ, which has multiple locations in Vietnam.

Cost: The price of Vietnamese silk artwork depends on a variety of factors, including size, but Mr. Ferguson said that if you invest $200 to $400, you'll get a beautiful piece.","From fabrics to gems, experts offer advice on the one thing your should choose from a variety of destinations in Asia.",b0f8404e-4bf3-5da8-b3fa-5c840a686d91,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/22/travel/22GETAWAY/22GETAWAY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4051bf43ab4c567006640828a69d5c2a8f1aec4dd47eafa8eaee924901693fa4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A young girl works on her embroidery in Vietnam.

Books,Dambisa Moyo: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/books/review/dambisa-moyo-by-the-book.html," What books are on your nightstand? A mishmash of books that reflect my interests -- Hal Higdon's ""Marathon""; Chris Bower's ""Federer""; William N. Thorndike's ""The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success""; Graham Allison's ""Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides's Trap?""; ""The Beekeeper's Bible: Bees, Honey, Recipes and Other Home Uses,"" by Richard Jones and Sharon Sweeney-Lynch; Robert J. Gordon's ""The Rise and Fall of American Growth: The U.S. Standard of Living Since the Civil War""; ""The Government Inspector,"" by Nikolai Gogol; and, hot off the presses, Iris Apfel's ""Accidental Icon: Musings of a Geriatric Starlet."" Oh, and a King James Bible just in case my mother comes by for a visit. Tell us about the last great book you read. Jeff Hobbs's ""The Short and Tragic Life of Robert Peace."" I wept throughout. It is the true story of the life (and untimely death) of an amazing young black man as told by his white Yale roommate and best friend. His struggle with straddling different cultures -- Newark's drug-fueled and gang-ridden streets versus Yale's establishment and world of legacies -- resonated with my own travails of being born and raised in Africa and living in Europe and the United States. Tragically, he did not escape his demons. This book impacted me in a deeply profound way.

What's the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently? That would have to be from William Thorndike's ""The Outsiders: Eight Unconventional CEOs and Their Radically Rational Blueprint for Success,"" with its revelation that companies that outperform their peers and financial benchmarks over long periods of time are doggedly focused on ""capital allocation."" Generally these companies have split roles at the helm: the chief executive, whose only job is to allocate capital (i.e. where to spend the company's marginal dollar), and the company president or chief operating officer, who is charged with running virtually everything else, from legal and regulatory matters to operations and technology, human capital, treasury and finance. What's the best book on economics? And the best work of economic history? ""The Wealth and Poverty of Nations: Why Some Are So Rich and Some So Poor,"" by David S. Landes, is, to my mind, right up there for the award for the best book on economics. Landes's comparison and explanation of the different success or failure rates among different regions of the world -- from the United States and Europe to China, Japan and Latin America -- remains a seminal work for anyone curious about economic growth. In a similar vein, Jared Diamond's ""Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies"" reset thinking on what explains economic growth. While not a traditional economics text, the book takes economics back to its roots to show how a country's material success crucially depends on the resources and factors with which it is endowed. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

What books do you think best capture your own political principles? I have always been fascinated by this quip famously attributed to Mark Twain: ""It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so."" So I tend to gravitate to books (and people) that question ideology and challenge sacred cows, which means no one book could capture my political principles.

I do find Jonathan Haidt's book ""The Righteous Mind: Why Good People Are Divided by Politics and Religion"" captivating. I am intrigued by the fact that a self-described liberal (at least he was in 2009) has the temerity to investigate why people (in particular working-class Americans) vote Republican. His answer? Human nature. In particular he argues that people are fundamentally emotional, not rational. This argument flies in the face of all the economics I have been taught, which rests on the foundation that people (economic agents) are rational. For anyone who wants to understand why liberal thinking can be unappealing at the polls (and what to do about it), read this. What's the last book you've recommended to somebody in your family? ""Living with a SEAL."" This is Jesse Itzler's insane story of living with David Goggins, a former Navy SEAL and workout fiend who has completed around 50 ultra-endurance races (including the 135-mile race in Death Valley, and an Ultraman: 6.2-mile ocean swim, 261-mile bike ride and then a 52.4-mile run), and has had Top 5 finishes in at least 20 of them. He also set the Guinness World Record with 4,030 pull-ups completed in 17 hours. I would train with Goggins (aptly nicknamed ""the toughest athlete on the planet"") if I had the guts. Sadly, I don't. But I loved the fact that Itzler moved Goggins into his home with his wife and kid for a month. I could not put the book down (I read it in one sitting with my mouth open in astonishment), and now follow Itzler and Goggins on Instagram. Which books do you think capture the current social and political moment in America? With the manifold cultures, religions, races and political beliefs that define America, I do not think such a book has been written, nor do I necessarily think it could be written -- certainly not by a singular author. That said, I am intrigued by two books that, if true, foretell a challenging road ahead for the United States. One is ""The Fourth Turning: An American Prophecy -- What the Cycles of History Tell Us About America's Next Rendezvous with Destiny,"" by Neil Howe and William Strauss. The other is Philip Roth's ""The Plot Against America,"" which offers an alternative history where Franklin D. Roosevelt loses the 1940 presidential election to Charles Lindbergh. Although both books are somewhat dated (published in 1997 and 2004, respectively) they offer compelling narratives that could explain the social and political shifts that appear to characterize the path the United States is on today. For what it's worth, I hope both books are wrong. Which historians and biographers do you most admire?

As far as contemporary biographers go, I believe Walter Isaacson is in a class by himself. Leonardo da Vinci, Steve Jobs, Einstein, Benjamin Franklin, Kissinger, take your pick -- all brilliant. How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? As a long-distance runner, do you ever listen to audiobooks while you run? I am definitely a simultaneous reader -- I choose what to read based on my mood, rather than force myself to keep reading or finish a book if it is not moving me at a particular moment. I read economics, politics and history books in paper (I need to scribble on the page and add dog-ears liberally), and sports and lifestyle books electronically. I have not yet switched my music playlist for audiobooks while I am running, but I am working on it. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? Murder mysteries! I love Agatha Christie's Belgian character Hercule Poirot (who appears in over 30 of her novels), but I confess my small collection is gathering dust as British television created a wonderful series with David Suchet. I find it particularly hilarious that Christie described Poirot as ""insufferable"" and a ""detestable, bombastic, tiresome, egocentric little creep."" What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most? I was born and raised on a healthy diet of the African Writers Series. Flora Nwapa's ""Efuru,"" Ngugi wa Thiong'o's ""The River Between"" and, of course, Chinua Achebe's ""No Longer at Ease"" and ""Things Fall Apart"" will forever be etched in my mind as shaping my formative years. You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite? 1) Vikram Seth, the economist turned novelist. His ""A Suitable Boy"" remains one of my all-time favorite books. 2) Ayn Rand, the philosopher and novelist. I am drawn to her irreverence -- a woman ahead of her time. 3) Maya Angelou, the poet who penned ""Still I Rise"" and ""Phenomenal Woman"" ... enough said. Of the books you've written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful? That's a hard question -- I imagine it is like picking your favorite child. I write the books I want to read so I am genuinely curious and intrigued by all the subjects I write on. But I suppose ""Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way for Africa"" is the most poignant.","The economist Dambisa Moyo, author most recently of ""Edge of Chaos,"" loves Agatha Christie's ""detestable, bombastic, tiresome, egocentric little creep"" Hercule Poirot.",c3a2eb05-1ac9-5438-b35e-5481371a8a06,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/29/books/review/29ByTheBook/29ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=471&w=900&s=09ade6c63a8c1ce6f3ae0dea68c8e50f81a7806c06ced09b5db3e5d89b7f2e08&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dambisa Moyo,c3a2eb05-1ac9-5438-b35e-5481371a8a06,N24News/imgs/c3a2eb05-1ac9-5438-b35e-5481371a8a06.jpg,13
Economy,New Layoffs Add to Worries Over U.S. Economic Slowdown,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/01/business/economy/layoffs-unemployment-claims.html,"The American economy is being buffeted by a fresh round of corporate layoffs, signaling new anxiety about the course of the coronavirus pandemic and uncertainty about further legislative relief. Companies including Disney, the insurance giant Allstate and two major airlines announced plans to fire or furlough more than 60,000 workers in recent days, and more cuts are expected without a new federal aid package to stimulate the economy. With the election a month away, an agreement has proved elusive. The White House and congressional Democrats held talks on Thursday before the House narrowly approved a $2.2 trillion proposal without any Republican support. It was little more than a symbolic vote: The measure will not become law without a bipartisan deal. After business shutdowns in the early spring threw 22 million people out of work, the economy rebounded in May and June with the help of stimulus money and rock-bottom interest rates. But the loss of momentum since then, coupled with fears of a second wave of coronavirus cases this fall, has left many experts uneasy about the months ahead.

""The layoffs are an additional headwind in an already weak labor market,"" said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist for High Frequency Economics. ""As long as the virus isn't contained, this is going to be an ongoing phenomenon."" The concern has grown as measures that helped the economy weather the initial contraction have wound down. The expiration of a $600-a-week federal supplement to unemployment benefits was followed by a 2.7 percent drop in personal income in August, the Commerce Department said Thursday. In a separate report, the Labor Department said 787,000 people filed new applications for state jobless benefits last week. The total, not adjusted for seasonal variations, was a slight decline from the previous week, but continued to reflect the highest level of claims in decades. The most recent layoffs are not included in that figure, nor will they be reflected in September data to be released by the department on Friday, the last monthly reading on the labor market before the election. The report is expected to show a continuing slowdown in hiring, with barely half of the spring's job losses recovered, although there is more uncertainty than usual around the estimates. ""This doesn't bode well for the economy,"" said Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""When you combine the layoffs with fiscal aid drying up, it points to very soft momentum in the final quarter of the year.""

Allstate announced Wednesday that it would lay off about 3,800 employees to reduce costs. Those are about 8 percent of the roughly 46,000 employees Allstate had at the end of 2019. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, one of the country's largest book publishers, said Thursday that it was cutting 22 percent of its work force, including 525 employees who were laid off and 166 who chose to retire. The company is a major supplier of educational books and materials, a business hit hard by school closings. The Walt Disney Company said Tuesday that it would eliminate 28,000 jobs, mostly at theme parks in Florida and California. Many of the workers had been on furlough since the spring, but the company said it was making the cuts permanent because of ""the continued uncertainty regarding the duration of the pandemic."" Travel, entertainment, and leisure and hospitality employers have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic, and they continue to lag even as other areas of the economy have reopened. The American Hotel & Lodging Association, a trade group, said that without new stimulus legislation, 74 percent of hotels would lay off additional employees and two-thirds would be out of business in six months.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution.
* The C.E.O. of Afiniti, an A.I. start-up, steps down after accusations of sexual assault.
* Google questions if the new Justice Department antitrust boss can be impartial. ""We're in a different phase of the recovery,"" Mr. Daco of Oxford Economics said, and with demand for many companies' services stuck below where it was before the pandemic, ""businesses are left with no other choice but to reduce costs.""

Consumer spending on goods -- whether for immediate consumption, like food, or used over a longer term, like appliances -- now exceeds levels preceding the pandemic. But outlays for services, which account for roughly two-thirds of the nation's economic activity, remain down about 8 percent. The economic picture is not completely bleak. Personal spending was up 1 percent last month, and readings of consumer confidence have been gaining. Helped by low mortgage rates, the housing market is on a tear in much of the country, lifting employment in residential construction 2.1 percent from June to August, according to the Associated General Contractors of America. But for many Americans, the easing of economic growth has meant an unexpected return to the ranks of the unemployed. When the pandemic struck in March, Alex Stern was furloughed from his job as a publicist at a public relations firm in New York. He was called back in May after the agency, which works with companies in the food and beverage industry, received a loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program.

But the company struggled to stay afloat, and Mr. Stern was permanently laid off on Tuesday. To pay the November rent, he will have to borrow money from his parents, he said. He is considering moving back to his childhood home in Pennsylvania until he can find a new job. ""I don't want to leave New York, and it's hard because I'm almost 30 years old and I don't know what I'm going to do next in life,"" Mr. Stern said.

Among those affected by the Disney cutbacks is Taisha Perez, 29, who had worked part time as a drummer at the Animal Kingdom Theme Park at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., for nearly three years. The job gave her both a steady source of income and time to pursue her passion, television acting. ""It's honestly my favorite job that I've ever had,"" Ms. Perez said. ""I loved putting a smile on people's faces."" When she was furloughed in mid-March after the pandemic hit, she thought she would be out of work for just a few weeks. But on Tuesday, a text message from her union representative told her that her job would not be coming back. ""I was just in shock,"" she said. ""I couldn't believe it."" Ms. Perez said she could pay her rent and utilities on the roughly $250 a week she receives in state unemployment benefits, but could not afford any extra expenses, like the car she needs after hers broke down in March. For those like Ms. Perez who lost work earlier in the year, the end of the $600 federal unemployment supplement has added to financial hardships. Joann Taylor, a 45-year-old catering coordinator at a McAlister's Deli franchise in Houston, used to work about 30 hours per week. But when the pandemic hit, her boss put her in an on-call position for deliveries only.

But when the $600 weekly supplement expired at the end of July, Ms. Taylor began struggling to pay her monthly bills, including $1,240 in rent, $180 for electricity, a $240 car payment and $155 for auto insurance. Determined to provide for her daughters, who are 6 and 14, she used the time while underemployed to get a license to sell life and health insurance. Now she's looking for an agency to take her on, hoping for steadier income. Until then, without further aid from Congress, Ms. Taylor is worried about paying the rent and buying groceries. ""I will have to go to every church around me and ask for help,"" she said. ""I will stand in food lines with the kids, because I cannot leave them at home. I will apply anywhere that I can for help, because there's no way that I can allow us to be homeless.""

Global Business,Italy Orders Seizure of $2.35 Billion in Siena Bank Inquiry,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/business/global/italy-seizes-nomura-assets-linked-to-siena-bank-inquiry.html,"FRANKFURT -- Italian officials on Tuesday broadened their investigation into whether the Japanese investment bank Nomura had helped hide losses at the troubled lender Monte dei Paschi di Siena by ordering the police to seize assets worth $2.35 billion. They also named Nomura's former top European executive, Sadeq Sayeed, as a suspect. Mr. Sayeed, who retired in 2010, denied any wrongdoing and said he had not learned of the accusations until asked about them by reporters on Tuesday. Another senior Nomura executive, Raffaele Ricci, is also a target of the inquiry, prosecutors said. Mr. Ricci could not be reached for comment. The unusual move to seize such a large sum, and go after prominent bankers, underlined the importance of the case in Italy and Europe, where it has contributed to anxiety about the country's ability to rebuild its economy and survive the financial crisis.

By intensifying the pressure on Nomura, Italian prosecutors are signaling that they are not letting up in their efforts to find out who bears criminal responsibility for transactions that left Monte dei Paschi in need of a $5.25 billion bailout by the Italian government. The bank, founded more than five centuries ago, is the oldest in the world and the third-largest bank in Italy. It has served a traditional role as benefactor to Siena, a small Tuscan city. A foundation that was the bank's main shareholder used its share of profits to help pay for services like day care, ambulances and even the Palio, the bareback horse race that is the picturesque city's trademark. But the scandal surrounding the bank has reverberated well beyond the medieval streets of Siena and its roughly 55,000 residents. The bank's problems, and the questions of who was to blame, played a role in the election campaign this year that left Italy so factionalized that a new national government has still not been formed. The lack of a strong government in Italy remains a risk to the euro zone. Furthermore, the country's struggling banks are unable to provide enough credit to support an economic recovery that Italy badly needs. Nomura has been sued by the new management of Monte dei Paschi for helping to design transactions that may have allowed previous managers at the bank to hide losses from regulators and shareholders.

In a statement, Nomura said that no assets had been seized yet. ""We will take all appropriate steps to protect our position and will vigorously contest any suggestions of wrongdoing in this matter,"" the bank said, declining to elaborate further.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. The Siena prosecutor's office said in a statement that most of the assets to be seized were collateral that Monte dei Paschi had posted with the Italian unit of Nomura in return for a loan. The operation was carried out by the Italian financial police in Siena, Rome, Milan and Bologna, as well as in the southern Italian city of Catanzaro, prosecutors said. In addition, the authorities ordered the freezing of assets in accounts of three former executives of Monte dei Paschi who are also under investigation: Giuseppe Mussari, former chairman of the bank; Antonio Vigni, a former chief executive; and Gianluca Baldassarri, the former chief financial officer. Mr. Baldassarri has been under arrest since February. Prosecutors said they suspect Mr. Mussari, Mr. Vigni and Mr. Baldassarri had obstructed the functions of regulators and misrepresented corporate assets, as well as other possible misdeeds. No formal charges have been filed against any of the people under investigation. Speaking by telephone from London on Tuesday, Mr. Sayeed said, ""I completely and absolutely and vigorously deny any allegations,"" which he said had ""no basis in fact."" Mr. Sayeed said he would not comment on individual transactions, but added that all transactions were carefully vetted and proper while he was head of Nomura in Europe. Before he retired in 2010 as head of Nomura in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, Mr. Sayeed, 59, was credited with engineering the Japanese bank's acquisition of the European assets of Lehman Brothers. The deal greatly expanded Nomura's reach in Europe, but eventually proved costly. Mr. Ricci, the other executive named in a statement by the Siena prosecutor Tuesday, has worked as a top executive in Nomura's business involving bonds and other fixed-income products. Nomura would not comment on Mr. Ricci's current status with the bank.

The complex transactions enabled Monte dei Paschi to transfer risk to the other banks, generating both profit and losses. But while Monte dei Paschi recorded the gains, it did not disclose all the losses. The questionable transactions came to light after Fabrizio Viola, Monte dei Paschi's new chief executive, in October found an exchange of letters with Nomura hidden in a safe. The bank consequently started a review of its financial portfolio, which led to a revision of its 2012 final results. Monte dei Paschi's problems began in 2008, when it acquired a regional lender, Banca Antonveneta, for $11.7 billion, a sum that analysts at the time regarded as excessive. Short of cash, Monte dei Paschi then tried to raise money without compromising its capital base and concealed certain features of the transaction, according to the Bank of Italy, the country's central bank. The Siena magistrates are now looking into allegations of bribery related to the Antonveneta deal.","Financial police seized 1.8 billion euros, or $2.35 billion, from Nomura's Italian unit in an inquiry into whether it helped Monte dei Paschi di Siena hide huge losses.",26532f22-36e9-5f65-9bbc-31aaf32be168,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/17/business/PASCHI/PASCHI-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=75f574c8b8e5071fec42f80197786d10af89001208d40ad71e8074a99c21e648&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The headquarters in Siena of the Italian bank Monte dei Paschi, the country's third largest bank and said to be the world's oldest.",26532f22-36e9-5f65-9bbc-31aaf32be168,N24News/imgs/26532f22-36e9-5f65-9bbc-31aaf32be168.jpg,24

LIFE SENTENCE 9 p.m. on the CW. In many films and television shows, a character's life is thrown into chaos after a cancer diagnosis. ""Life Sentence"" explores the opposite scenario. After living with terminal cancer for eight years, Stella (Lucy Hale of ""Pretty Little Liars"") finds out she has been cured. Suddenly all her live-in-the-moment cliches start to ring hollow; her family, which had invested its time and money in sending her off with love, starts to fray. ""The show has a perky earnestness, buoyant enough to float over the genuine agonies of cancer while still acknowledging some of the emotional fallout,"" Margaret Lyons wrote in The New York Times.

Art & Design,Christie's New Auction Technique: The Global Gavel,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/arts/design/christies-auction.html,"It started in Hong Kong at 9:25 in the evening, moved back eight time zones to Paris and London in the afternoon, and then finished in New York at 11:15 Friday morning. In just under four hours, $420.9 million had been spent. This was the back-to-the-future format of Christie's live-streamed ""ONE"" sale, the latest attempt by an international auction house to demonstrate that, thanks to the latest technology, the multimillion-dollar top end of the art market can still sparkle in the gloom of a pandemic. Christie's four-venue ""global 20th century art sale"" replaced the company's live evening auctions of contemporary, Impressionist and modern art in New York in May and in London in June. It followed Sotheby's pioneering live-streamed $363.2 million ""clicks and bricks"" auction on June 29, and an equivalent hybrid offering at Phillips on July 2 that raised $41 million. The Covid-induced shift from live to online-only sales has severely dented turnover at the major auction houses. During the second quarter of 2020, Christie's auction revenues were down 60 percent from the same period last year, according to the London art analytics company Pi-eX. Christie's, like Sotheby's and Phillips, has had to come up with compelling new auction formats to re-engage the 0.01 percent of the population that buys and sells big-ticket art.

That was certainly the thinking behind Christie's ""ONE"" sale, a relay of four auctioneers seamlessly ""passing the gavel"" in real time, ""crossing borders to create one vision, one sale."" Unlike Sotheby's ""multicamera global livestream"" predecessor, which featured one auctioneer in an empty studio fluently fielding telephone and online bids from screens, Christie's sequence of live sales had a lot of moving parts, some of which moved better than others. ""It seemed to be a great thing, but access was a little complicated, and when the Hong Kong auction was not starting half an hour late, I lost interest,"" said Nikolaus Barta, a collector and art insurer, based in Vienna. The sale eventually started 56 minutes late. The live feed was prone to freezing and breaking, and viewers were at times confused as to which auctioneer was actually selling the work in question. ""No, I'm selling it,"" said a frustrated Cecile Verdier, Christie's auctioneer in Paris, as Jussi Pylkkanen, the company's global president, conducted a mini-auction in London for the impressive 1963 Jean Dubuffet painting, ""Pourleche Fiston."" It eventually topped the Paris session with a price of 6.5 million euros, or about $7.4 million.

The sale was meant to have been kick-started in Hong Kong by a large red ""Hurricane Period"" abstract from 1963 by Zao Wou-Ki, Asia's most coveted postwar international artist. Estimated to sell for at least $10 million, it failed to find a buyer. ""I was surprised,"" said Christian Ogier, a Paris-based dealer who specializes in modern Asian art. ""I thought someone in Asia would go for it. The size, color and date were good. But it was incredibly expensive."" It was left instead to the 1989 Gerhard Richter abstract, ""Frost (1)"" to lead a less than effervescent 10-lot Hong Kong session with a price of $10.3 million, just above its high estimate. Over in London, Rene Magritte's quintessentially enigmatic 1962 painting, ""L'Arc de Triomphe,"" depicting a tree standing in front of a wall of foliage, inspired serious competition, almost doubling its estimate to sell to a telephone bidder in New York for 17.8 million pounds, or about $22.4 million.

Roy Lichtenstein's iconic 1994 Pop canvas, ""Nude With Joyous Painting,"" valued at $30 million, proved to be more in tune with billionaires' current collecting tastes. From the series of nudes that the artist painted during the last five years of his life, and never seen at auction before, this piece sparked a nine-minute battle between telephone bidders, before falling to a client in Hong Kong for the sale's top price of $46.2 million. Most remarkable of the seven new auction highs set in New York for individual artists was the $30.9 million given for ""Complements,"" an admired 8-foot-wide, two-panel abstract of colorful intertwining threads painted by the in-vogue American Minimalist painter Brice Marden, the subject of a sold-out show at the Gagosian Gallery in New York last year. Painted between 2004 and 2007, and guaranteed to sell for a minimum of $30 million, ""Complements"" more than tripled the artist's previous auction high. Such are the dynamics of the market for contemporary art that auction prices for Mr. Marden are now almost as high as those for an old master like for Rembrandt, whose current auction record is $33.2 million, according to Artprice. ""Christie's was trying to set a whole new load of records for artists because they thought they had the whole world looking on,"" said Michael Short, an art adviser in Berlin, who noticed the measured nature of the bidding on many of the lots. ""It didn't have the animal energy of a live auction."" But others were impressed. ""It was an incredible live experiment, which allows one to feel and realize the width, and breadth of the art market, as well as judge the depth of it on a specific artist or artwork,"" said Mr. Ogier, the Paris-based dealer. Overall, Christie's inaugural ONE sale raised $420.9 million from 79 offered lots. ""It's a great result in the circumstances of the market,"" said Guillaume Cerutti, Christie's chief executive, at the post-sale Zoom news conference. ""As a global concept it worked very well."" He added that more than. 20,000 people followed the sale on various digital channels. But as was the case the previous week at Sotheby's, year-on-year sales figures were significantly lower. Last May, Christie's evening sales of Impressionist, modern and contemporary art raised $937.8 million, more than double the proceeds of the ""ONE"" auction.","The sale on Friday, which started in Hong Kong and included Paris, London and New York, raised $420.9 million.",e56311f1-5dc2-5cf9-88c1-2fa08b2037e4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/10/arts/10auction1/10auction1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=31231284352d8af24e37ee9a8a9c246741be843848e32fa80253a18a778823e9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Complements,"" by the American Minimalist painter Brice Marden, sold for more than triple the artist's previous auction high.",e56311f1-5dc2-5cf9-88c1-2fa08b2037e4,N24News/imgs/e56311f1-5dc2-5cf9-88c1-2fa08b2037e4.jpg,14
Movies,Review: The Ring Is a Cage in Every Sense in 'The Cage Fighter',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/movies/the-cage-fighter-review.html,"The straightforward, elemental documentary ""The Cage Fighter"" suggests that many of the cliches of boxing and wrestling movies -- about not being able to resist a last fight, about the ring's lure being a force more powerful than love -- aren't cliches at all, but simply true to life.

With a bare-bones, direct-cinema style and only scant context, the movie -- the first directorial feature from Jeff Unay, who has worked in visual effects -- plunges viewers into the world of Joe Carman, a mixed martial arts fighter in Washington State. In the first scene, Mr. Carman is 39, hardly a prime age for grappling. The question that emerges is whether he knows it's time to call it quits.

Mr. Unay often shoots Mr. Carman in wide screen at close range, emphasizing the physical strain of his routines, whether he's running, training or doing mechanical work for a ferry system. Part of the secret of the movie's interest is that Mr. Carman is not invincible or a former superstar. We're told that he doesn't even make money off cage matches.

Yet the damage they do to his home life is real. ""It's the only time in my life when I feel proud of myself,"" he tells dismayed family members who have just learned that he is fighting again, despite having promised his ill wife never to get back in the ring. Fighting, he says, allows him to feel that he likes himself. Mr. Carman is shown throughout the film as a loving parent (we see him dancing with his daughters and making them pancakes), but he can't check his pride. Fighting means being in a cage in more than one sense.",This documentary suggests that boxing-movie clichés may simply be true to life.,23f55051-42fe-59c8-82df-1c0f3f24f26c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/02/arts/02cage1/cage1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=267307dd20964f9841a32e5de27952a2cc039be032c3e4744c964be3416a3fe4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joe Carman and Clayton Hoy in ""The Cage Fighter.""",23f55051-42fe-59c8-82df-1c0f3f24f26c,N24News/imgs/23f55051-42fe-59c8-82df-1c0f3f24f26c.jpg,5

Television,Jerrod Carmichael Is Ready to Get Personal (to a Degree),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/13/arts/television/jerrod-carmichael-home-videos.html,"""The only thing weirder than finding out your father has a second family -- is finding out that you guys are that second family."" That was how Jerrod Carmichael ended his 2017 HBO stand-up special ""8""; after nearly an hour of riffs, the comedian just casually presented this idea to his audience. ""What else should we talk about?"" he continued, right before the special jarringly cut to the credits. It wasn't a grand-finale punch line Carmichael had been obviously building toward throughout the 50-plus minutes that preceded it. It lacked catharsis; as an out-of-left-field observation, it could be interpreted as the most deeply personal moment of the performance, or as an absurdist misdirect meant to tease viewers' expectations.

Maybe it was a bit of both. On Sunday evening, HBO hosted the premiere of ""Home Videos,"" a loose half-hour of cinema verite documenting Carmichael's off-the-cuff chats with some of the women in his life during a visit to his hometown, Winston-Salem, N.C. Instead of performing onstage, the comedian plays an affable investigator, interviewing his subjects about topics like beauty standards, R. Kelly, blackness and sensitive family history. In one conversation with his mother, Cynthia, he brings up his father's infidelity and ""multiple children outside of the relationship."" ""I'm not going to say the hurt and anger didn't try to build, because I'm human,"" Cynthia tells him. ""But -- maybe I suppressed some of it -- but talking, and asking enough questions, I don't know. I'm pretty much content."" She adds that it's up to her husband to prove to her that he can be trusted again, and that as far as she can tell, he has.

""It's an emotional mountain my family has had to climb and is still climbing it in some ways,"" he explained. ""Saying it at that point, that was as far as I was willing to go, kind of out of respect."" ""Home Videos"" might be his most revealing project yet; it's certainly his most intimate. Over a few days in January, Carmichael directed and shot the special on film (Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Phantom Thread"" was an inspiration) with one camera and a small crew in and around the homes of his mother, his sister and a family friend. Short vignettes between the segments show him playing around with his nieces in their quiet suburban neighborhood. It's difficult to pin down what exactly ""Home Videos"" is supposed to be. Carmichael isn't sure either, though he described it as equal parts ""investigative piece,"" ""just videos"" and a ""prestige reality show."" ""I didn't know what it was, but I knew the intention, and just off the intention of it [HBO] trusted me to go and make something."" The idea was born in part out of a desire to see the black women in his life represented onscreen in ways he hadn't seen before. He pitched the show to his family as having an ""honest conversation"" and prepared no questions beforehand. He had one rule for his subjects: ""Just don't lie.""

In another scene, he speaks with the 11-year-old Joliet, Valencia's bookish daughter, about school, role models and whether she sees herself represented in film and TV. When he asks her to tell him the secret to being happy, she responds, in part: ""You have to know what you want, not what everyone else wants."" Carmichael is taken aback. ""Who the [expletive] are you?"" he says, laughing. I asked him if today's kids and teens made him feel hopeful about society's future. ""Oh, yeah,"" he said. ""I think what black kids were to sports and entertainment, they're going to be to nuclear physics or biochemistry.""

This perspective is a stark pivot from ""8,"" where he stated his wish that black people as a collective were ""further along,"" and which largely consisted of Carmichael's agonizing over his inability to feel for or care about, well, anything. (Including, but not limited to: animals, weddings, the ""I Have a Dream"" speech.) He admits that at that time he ""felt passionately about my lack of passion for certain things."" Now, he said, he can better acknowledge his own feelings, particularly as they relate to Joliet. ""It's funny -- with her, I would die for her. Like, actually die for her,"" he said. ""And that's a thing that, being honest with myself, I didn't realize I felt until -- just this moment you look at her like, 'Oh wow, this is incredibly powerful, what this is.'"" It's the conversation with his mother in ""Home Videos,"" however, that most implies Carmichael is a bit more sensitive than he's seemed in the past. At one point, he asks if she finally accepts that she, a dark-skinned woman, is in fact pretty. ""She's always struggled with that,"" Carmichael told me. ""She's a beautiful, beautiful person, and watching her not be able to come to terms with that -- as a son, it breaks your heart."" When it came to his mother's relationship with his father, Carmichael said there were things he had sensed while growing up but hadn't dug into deeply. While he approached this opportunity to discuss it with his mother as though it were their ""last conversation ever,"" he was also careful not to press the issue too much.

""Home Videos"" ends on its own kind of post-credits cliffhanger: Carmichael meeting one of his half-siblings for the first time. The week before we met, Carmichael had gone back to North Carolina to shoot what might be another installment of the show with his father, Joe, and uncle. At the time of our interview, Carmichael wasn't sure if the episode would be released, but he did say that his grandfather, who had over two dozen children with his wife and other women, was one of the topics he discussed with his uncle. He said he didn't know if his father had been completely forthcoming during their conversation. ""Obviously you would like to believe everything,"" he said. But ""you look at history, you look at patterns, and like, it makes it difficult."" ""But,"" Carmichael added, ""he was willing enough to explore his feelings and explore logic and that type of thing."" ""Home Videos,"" as it exists now for public consumption, is reflective of where Carmichael seems to be in this moment -- ""really happy"" with life, experimental and cautiously open to letting viewers get a glimpse of his origin story. For now, he's lost interest in standup as a means of channeling his ""obsessions,"" and is absorbed with the idea of directing and eager to reach a point where he can finally make his first feature film. But Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock have urged him to keep performing. ""I don't know what more motivation I would need than two living icons of the form just really wanting me to do it more,"" Carmichael said. ""I just need to get a few things out first, and then we'll see.""","The comedian's new HBO special, ""Home Videos,"" is an intimate look at his family's history and his own willingness to share it with his audience.",ab682181-fbdb-564c-9e51-44b005c9d97c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/13/arts/13carmichael1-promo/13carmichael1-promo-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bc4f204fd3270db51d56b5ddb613c06a31a28f856c9b83dcde484892546162e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jerrod Carmichael's latest project isn't a stand-up special or a sitcom — it's ""Home Videos,"" an intimate docuseries about his family.",ab682181-fbdb-564c-9e51-44b005c9d97c,N24News/imgs/ab682181-fbdb-564c-9e51-44b005c9d97c.jpg,3
Science,Johns Hopkins Opens New Center for Psychedelic Research,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/science/psychedelic-drugs-hopkins-depression.html,"Since childhood, Rachael Petersen had lived with an unexplainable sense of grief that no drug or talk therapy could entirely ease. So in 2017 she volunteered for a small clinical trial at Johns Hopkins University that was testing psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, for chronic depression. ""I was so depressed,"" Ms. Petersen, 29, said recently. ""I felt that the world had abandoned me, that I'd lost the right to exist on this planet. Really, it was like my thoughts were so stuck, I felt isolated."" The prospect of tripping for hours on a heavy dose of psychedelics was scary, she said, but the reality was profoundly different: ""I experienced this kind of unity, of resonant love, the sense that I'm not alone anymore, that there was this thing holding me that was bigger than my grief. I felt welcomed back to the world."" On Wednesday, Johns Hopkins Medicine announced the launch of the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, to study compounds like LSD and psilocybin for a range of mental health problems, including anorexia, addiction and depression. The center is the first of its kind in the country, established with $17 million in commitments from wealthy private donors and a foundation. Imperial College London launched what is thought to be the world's first such center in April, with some $3.5 million from private sources.

""This is an exciting initiative that brings new focus to efforts to learn about mind, brain and psychiatric disorders by studying the effects of psychedelic drugs,"" Dr. John Krystal, chair of psychiatry at Yale University, said in an email about the Johns Hopkins center. The centers at Johns Hopkins and Imperial College give ""psychedelic medicine,"" as some call it, a long-sought foothold in the scientific establishment. Since the early 2000s, several scientists have been exploring the potential of psychedelics and other recreational drugs for psychiatric problems, and their early reports have been tantalizing enough to generate a stream of positive headlines and at least two popular books. The emergence of depression treatment with the anesthetic and club drug ketamine and related compounds, which cause out-of-body sensations, also has piqued interest in mind-altering agents as aids to therapy. But the drugs' history of abuse and the still thin evidence base have kept the field largely on the fringes, and many experts are still wary. Psychedelic trials cannot be ""blinded"" in the same way most drug trials are: participants know when they have been dosed, and reports of improvement aren't yet standardized. ""It raises the caution that the investigation of hallucinogens as treatments may be endangered by grandiose descriptions of their effects and unquestioning acceptance of their value,"" Dr. Guy Goodwin, a professor of psychiatry at Oxford wrote, in a recent commentary, in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. ""Timothy Leary was a research psychologist before he decided the whole world should 'Turn on, tune in, and drop out.' It is best if some steps are not retraced."" The scientists doing the work, at Hopkins, Imperial College and elsewhere, acknowledge as much, and say the new infusion of funding will help clarify which drugs help which patients, and when the altered states are ineffectual, or potentially dangerous.

""It's been hand-to-mouth in this field, and now we have the core funding and infrastructure to really advance psychedelic science in a way that hasn't been done before,"" said Roland Griffiths, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins who will direct the new center. Dr. Griffiths said the new funds will cover six full-time faculty, five postdoctoral scientists and the costs of running trials. Among the first of those trials are a test of psilocybin for anorexia nervosa and of psilocybin for psychological distress and cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer's disease. ""The one that's crying out to be done is for opiate-use disorder, and we also plan to look at that,"" Dr. Griffiths said. Trials using psychedelics or other mind-altering drugs tend to have a similar structure. Participants, whether they have a diagnosis of PTSD, depression or substance abuse, do extensive preparation with a therapist, which includes a complete medical history and advice and information about the study drug. People with a history of psychosis are typically excluded, as psychedelics can exacerbate their condition. And those on psychiatric medications usually taper off beforehand. On treatment day, the person comes into the clinic, takes the drug and sits or lies down, under continuous observation by a therapist, who provides support and occasional guidance as the drug's effects become felt. In the Johns Hopkins trial that Ms. Petersen joined, participants wore eyeshades and headphones, lay down and listened to music. ""The first trip lasted six and half hours, and I didn't move,"" she recalled. A week later, she returned for another dose; each dose was about twice what recreational users take. Therapy using psychedelics or other mind-altering compounds typically involves just one or two sessions on the drug. ""I would be lying if I said aspects of my experience weren't deeply challenging and upsetting,"" Ms. Petersen said. ""The therapist would grab my hand -- would save me in a moment -- and encourage me to adopt a posture of welcoming everything, like a meditation."" The literature so far, from trials like these, suggests that psilocybin is promising for chronic depression and addiction, and that M.D.M.A., or ecstasy, can help people with post-traumatic stress, including veterans. Cannabis and LSD also have been tried, for addiction and other problems, with mixed results.

One finding many drug studies share is that any positive effects are far more likely to last if the participant has an especially intense trip. The intensity is subjectively graded using a variety of measures, including what scientists call the MEQ, for ""mystical experience, questionnaire,"" although Dr. Griffiths allowed that the term is misleading. "" T hat was a significant branding mistake, because awe is not fun,"" he said. ""T here's something existentially shaking about these experiences."" It is that existential reckoning, the theory goes, that prompts many people to rejigger their identities or priorities in a way that reduces habitual behaviors or lines of thinking that cause distress. In a continuing trial, Matthew Johnson, an addiction specialist at Johns Hopkins and a member of the new psychedelic center, is investigating how psilocybin treatment compares to use of a nicotine patch in helping people to quit smoking. So far, in the 39 people who have been in the study for at least six months, the abstinence rate in the psilocybin group is 50 percent, compared to 32 percent using the patch. ""The most compelling thing that makes psilocybin different from other addiction drugs is that it's showing this cross-drug efficacy,"" Dr. Johnson said. ""It appears to have a similar effect, regardless of what drug the person is addicted to."" That great potential, across many different diagnoses, is what attracted a small group of donors to Johns Hopkins, said Tim Ferriss, who brought in half the donated amount from investors, including more than $2 million from himself. Mr. Ferriss, an investor and author, said that depression and addiction ran in his own family, and that available treatments were often inadequate. His investment in the center, he said, ""was a chance to have a large output from a small input -- a real Archimedes lever."" The Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation provided the balance of the commitments. Ms. Petersen is convinced that her psilocybin trip made a lasting difference. She has had one relapse since the trial, she said, and continued on antidepressant drugs. As a result of the trial, she also reordered her life, committing more time to things that are emotionally sustaining, and letting go of those there weren't.","The research center, with $17 million from donors, aims to give ""psychedelic medicine"" a long-sought foothold in the scientific establishment.",0aa94a37-7950-5fa5-8195-faa1a1d37027,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/10/science/04PSYCHEDELICS1/04PSYCHEDELICS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=e7401aa16f1af8a95d244b5ef691e0bd701cd4adb968359a139d5a483ce7fc28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mazatec psilocybin mushrooms ready for harvest.

Books,Was It the Perfect Crime or a Paranoid Fantasy?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/books/review/junichiro-tanizaki-in-black-and-white.html,"In terms of genre, ""In Black and White"" is a comic novel satirizing the Japanese confessional narrative, which has identifiable resemblance to the author's life; it functions as a framed story, or a story-within-a-story, nesting the fates of two writers. At the outset, a magazine called The People commissions the protagonist, Mizuno, to write a mystery. Mizuno intends to describe a perfect crime, one in which the killer can't be caught. In this story, ""To the Point of Murder,"" the victim is a writer named Codama whom Mizuno bases on a writer of his acquaintance named Cojima. The difficulty begins when Mizuno carelessly includes the model's name, Cojima, toward the end of the manuscript and the story goes to press uncorrected. Paranoid, Mizuno believes that the literary world will recognize the real Cojima as the model for Codama, then leaps very far to the delusional conclusion that if the real Cojima were to be killed, Mizuno himself would be blamed. (A little Tanizaki humor: For a writer, the lack of a copy editor may lead to murder charges.)

A magical thinker of the first order, Mizuno decides to write himself out of real criminal guilt by producing a fictional sequel, ""To the Point of the Murder of the Man Who Wrote 'To the Point of Murder,'"" which features a so-called Shadow Man. The reader can't know if the Shadow Man is real because he never makes an appearance, but it is he who has orchestrated the death of Codama so the unnamed author in the mystery story can be framed for murder, tortured and forced to confess, then be executed. By the end of the fictional sequel, the Shadow Man murders the fictional Codama and the state executes the fictional author. However, the reader will discover that the author is innocent because the diabolical Shadow Man has engineered the execution of both writers.

Mizuno is a morally suspect, slothful and self-centered man, yet he's sufficiently talented that his social misdemeanors -- rent arrears, missed deadlines, personal debts, lies, cruelty to others -- are tolerated. Here, as elsewhere in Tanizaki's oeuvre, there are recognizable sexual obsessions and female types. Mizuno has an ex-wife who left him because he wrote too many wife-murder stories; she ends up marrying a Methodist minister and converting to Christianity. Then Mizuno falls under the spell of Fraulein, a heartless Japanese prostitute who speaks German and eats black bread and sausages. The innocent and dull wife stands in sharp contrast to Mizuno's ""contract mistress,"" who has ""the look of a Western streetwalker."" Mizuno gives Fraulein the yen he has taken dishonestly from his publisher so she can ""pretend and make it seem to me like real love.""

""In Black and White"" is highly plotted and self-consciously clever. Nevertheless, the reader is left wanting because the story lacks the pathos and bathos that great comic fiction requires. At times, this slim novel can drag, something a serial writer must take great care to prevent. That said, Tanizaki does raise important aesthetic questions about what fiction writers do and why.","Junichiro Tanizaki's early novel ""In Black and White"" uses nested murder plots to explore the guilt and responsibilities of the writing life.",50366d65-8fa0-51c0-a38e-80c331080679,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/18/books/review/18LEE/18LEE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=c38a8c6609f01243c6b8b1000ba3111926aeeb3f396ea9fd0eea20018720ef72&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Junichiro Tanizaki,50366d65-8fa0-51c0-a38e-80c331080679,N24News/imgs/50366d65-8fa0-51c0-a38e-80c331080679.jpg,13
Economy,Labor Department Seeks to Make More Eligible for Overtime,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/business/economy/overtime-rules-labor.html,"The Labor Department is proposing to expand overtime eligibility to include most salaried workers earning less than about $35,000 a year. The new threshold would be substantially higher than the current level of about $23,700, but would cover fewer workers than an Obama administration initiative that was thrown out by a federal judge. Under the proposal announced Thursday, most workers earning less than the new threshold must receive time-and-a-half pay when they work more than 40 hours a week. The department anticipates that the rule will expand overtime eligibility by just over one million workers, absent an intervention by their employers, such as raising their salaries.

The proposal will be subject to a 60-day public comment period, and the department expects it to take effect around January. The current threshold was set by the George W. Bush administration in 2004. The Obama administration set the salary threshold at about $47,500 when it put forward a new rule in 2016. But a federal judge in Texas suspended the rule just before it was to take effect, arguing that the administration lacked the authority for such a significant increase. The same judge later invalidated the Obama rule. While the Trump administration has appealed the judge's decision, it asked the court to pause the appeal while it prepared a new version of the rule. Heidi Shierholz, a former Labor Department chief economist who was involved in the Obama administration's effort, said that the threshold in the new proposal was at the upper end of what she had expected, but that she was still disappointed with the figure. ""Their analysis of the rule looks similar to what we did,"" said Ms. Shierholz, now director of policy at the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ""The problem is their own analysis shows millions fewer workers get covered.""

But Tammy McCutchen, one of the architects of the Bush administration's increase, said she was pleased that the department had set the threshold at about the 20th percentile of earnings for salaried workers in the South -- in line with where she and her colleagues had set it in 2004.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""I think that's what they had to do in light of the Texas court decision,"" said Ms. McCutchen, a lawyer at the management-side firm Littler Mendelson. ""Anything higher would have been subject to challenge again."" Many employers and business groups argued that while the 2004 threshold was in need of an increase, the magnitude of the Obama change was unreasonable. Some argued that it would significantly increase costs for employers, who would either have to pay out hundreds of millions more in overtime or raise workers' salaries above the new threshold to avoid paying additional overtime. Many critics also said salaried workers would suffer a loss of status by having to account for their time the way hourly workers do. The Obama administration argued that its proposal was modest by historical standards, noting that it would make fewer than 40 percent of salaried workers eligible for overtime pay based on their salaries, far less than the percentage who were eligible in 1975. Even so, it estimated that more than four million workers would gain the right to overtime pay under its rule. Other skeptics argued that the change would have little impact because employers would lower the base wage of people who work significant overtime hours, leaving their total pay, including wages and overtime, roughly unchanged.","The proposal would affect salaried workers making less than $35,000, up from about $23,700, but is less sweeping than an Obama administration plan.",16ed2452-556a-53e7-b1ed-ac9fc73cf6a9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/07/business/07overtime2/07overtime2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=71c259e7870001d321f120a3d211bdde4d95169cb011c361e4eaf4bf23829448&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Labor Department's proposal on overtime would affect salaried workers making less than $35,000, up from $23,700.",16ed2452-556a-53e7-b1ed-ac9fc73cf6a9,N24News/imgs/16ed2452-556a-53e7-b1ed-ac9fc73cf6a9.jpg,8
Theater,A Childhood Eden Seared by Violence. Set to Music?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/theater/bengsons-the-lucky-ones-ars-nova.html,"There's a line near the start of the new musical ""The Lucky Ones"" that's a deliberate hedge -- an explanation of the rules of the show that also leaves those rules a little murky. ""This is a true story,"" Shaun Bengson tells the audience from the stage of the Connelly Theater in the East Village. ""Even the parts that never happened."" And with those words, Mr. Bengson and his wife, Abigail -- the other half of the folk-rock duo the Bengsons, the indie-theater darlings who created the show for Ars Nova -- attempt to draw a cloak of privacy around themselves and the people they love. Ms. Bengson, 35, has a tale to tell about the autumn she was 15, when her family shattered and the seemingly safe Eden she grew up in was lost forever. Yet she is terrified of compounding anyone's anguish.

So ""The Lucky Ones"" is wounded autobiography veiled in fiction. Set in crunchy small-town New England (""a part of Vermont that happens to be in Maine""), it's a follow-up to ""Hundred Days,"" a musical memoir of the Bengsons' beginnings as a couple that was a hit last fall at New York Theater Workshop. Like ""Hundred Days,"" ""The Lucky Ones"" is directed by Anne Kauffman and has a book co-written by the playwright Sarah Gancher, who is the Bengsons' neighbor across the hall in Ridgewood, Queens. In the new show, an extended family runs a school together, raising their children -- Abigail, her sisters and their cousins -- in a kind of hippie idyll. Then, in one cataclysmic season, it all falls apart, beginning with a killing that might have been prevented if only the parents hadn't been so committed to a you-choose-your-feelings worldview that they dismissed the signs of mental illness in one of the kids. ""It's possible that we have all been raised in a way that hurt us,"" Abigail says in the show. ""And maybe hurt us so badly that we will hurt other people."" Like Abigail, the character she plays in ""The Lucky Ones,"" Ms. Bengson grew up in an extended hippie family that revolved around a school. In reality, though, the person in her clan who killed someone was not a blood relative but rather a person she had been raised to consider an older sibling -- someone she loved and admired, who ""wrote strange and beautiful music,"" who claimed to hear voices and did as they instructed. This is the person, no longer institutionalized, whose life Ms. Bengson is most fearful of harming with ""The Lucky Ones,"" an ensemble piece in which a cascade of events results in the dissolution of her family, including her parents' marriage.

A large-scale show with a chorus, it's intended as the second part of a trilogy that will continue with a musical about Mr. Bengson's early life. Critical reception of ""The Lucky Ones"" has been mixed, with Jesse Green of The New York Times calling it ""a gawky, powerful work in progress,"" while Sandy MacDonald, in Time Out New York, found it ""harrowing."" Ms. Bengson is sure of her right to tell such a story onstage because it is a fundamental trauma of her past, overlapping though it does with other people's pain and struggles. Yet the acceptability of drawing bystanders into one's own art is one of the great ethical debates in any kind of autobiography. That's true even when you change names and details, and create what Mr. Bengson called ""the novel-myth version"" of the story.

""Is it possible to tell the truth kindly?"" Ms. Bengson said. ""I don't know. But it's what I'm trying to do."" ""One of my sisters, she said, 'Don't let your fear get in the way of the truth of this,'"" Ms. Bengson added. ""I know that in taking this on, I can't be meek, I can't glaze over, I can't allow fear or denial to be the story of our family, because that was toxic, too."" Ars Nova, which also co-produced ""Sundown, Yellow Moon,"" a Rachel Bonds play with music by the Bengsons, has an estimable record with nontraditional musicals that includes birthing ""Natasha, Pierre & the Great Comet of 1812."" It was the company that matched Ms. Gancher with the Bengsons several years ago. To whatever degree ""The Lucky Ones"" is fictionalized, she finds it ""really lovely to be working on a true story.""

""I spend so much of my life making up characters or brainstorming situations or coming up with scenarios,"" Ms. Gancher said. ""The beauty part of this is that any question that I can think of to ask, there's an answer to, and the answer is always weirder and more interesting and more surprising and sort of brighter than anything that I could make up."" And she has a deep affection for the Bengsons. ""They're people with a lot of pain and a lot of damage,"" she said, ""but also a lot of strength and a lot of magic."" They are also so intertwined, personally and professionally, that they share a bio in the program for ""The Lucky Ones."" ""Is that gross?"" Ms. Bengson asked recently, in the tone of someone checking to make sure she doesn't have lipstick on her teeth. ""I recognize it's a little codependent."" Mr. Bengson, 34, cracked up at this, seated beside her in the apartment in Alphabet City where they stayed through early previews, to be close to the theater. Ms. Bengson says that she and her husband are both ""profoundly introverted,"" but you wouldn't know it from talking with them. He seems gentle, diffident but steely underneath, while there's a sparkle to her, and a healthy dash of punk spicing her earth-mother serenity. Louie, their blond-ringleted toddler, is a year and a half old, and Ms. Bengson throws up her hands at the challenge of not swearing in front of him. ""He's going to be a pirate by 5,"" she said, and her husband laughed again. ""But I can't stop. So, you're welcome, Louie.""

The Bengsons married 10 years ago, three weeks after their first date. Four years ago, shortly after they got the commission from Ars Nova that would result in ""The Lucky Ones,"" Ms. Bengson had a miscarriage -- an event that ""rocked us very deeply,"" she said, and ""set us on this path of wanting to write about family and trauma."" Part of that was an awareness, new to Mr. Bengson, of what a fragile thing a family can be. Part of it was a wish to examine how to go about making a family -- thoughtfully, unconventionally, as their own parents did -- even while aware of the unintended harm that parents can cause children in the process.

At least at the start, they also nursed the naive wish to repair what had been broken in Ms. Bengson's adolescence -- ""to Parent Trap the family,"" as Mr. Bengson put it. ""Sometimes there are wounds so deep that they never all the way heal,"" he said. ""And I really hoped that wasn't so."" Some people in the family Ms. Bengson grew up in don't talk to one another anymore, but for the musical the Bengsons interviewed all of them -- including the older sibling, so-called, who committed the crime. Those interviews became part of the piece. Primarily for ethical reasons, Ms. Bengson said, they did not contact relatives of the person who was killed. In her own family, opinion about the existence of the show is divided -- some of those depicted vehemently in favor, some opposed. Some have come to see it. The Bengsons' nightmare scenario is to have family drama break out in the audience, where they would have to witness it from the stage.

A few performances deeper into previews, after they had moved back home to Queens, Ms. Bengson sat at their blond-wood kitchen table, a plastic bag of old cassette tapes in front of her. Some of those tapes, she said, have been to prison and back -- cassettes on which her budding-songwriter self set down in music the fraught emotions she couldn't speak. Her older sibling, so-called, would respond with feedback on her craftsmanship that helped to shape her as an artist. ""I'd be like, 'Hey, it's Friday,' talking about nothing, and then I'd sing this heavy piece of music, talking about everything,"" she said, and she realized that's not so different from what she's doing with the show itself. ""I'm like, here I am, sending tapes to them, 20 years later."" By ""them,"" she means her family. A half-hour into an emotionally delicate interview, there was a soft knock on the front door: Ms. Gancher, bringing over some eggs in the shell. ""Thank you,"" Ms. Bengson said from the kitchen. ""I'll eat those eggs. I love you so much!"" ""I love you, too,"" Ms. Gancher said, and exited. A while later, this cameo struck Ms. Bengson as curious. ""I wonder if she really wanted to give me eggs, or if she just wanted to make sure I was O.K."" Either way, the closest Ms. Bengson has felt to how she did before her family cracked apart is with the artistic family behind ""The Lucky Ones,"" a show that allows her to spend time again in her childhood Eden, if only in her imagination.

But she thinks of Eden now as a place you have to outgrow, accepting the complexity of life and the presence of darkness -- without fixating on the darkness. ""The task, I think, of storytelling,"" she said, ""is the reintegration of the dark and the light -- going back and saying, 'Yes, this darkness is here and it's true.' And, 'There was light on us once, and there will be again.'""","The Bengsons are a folk-rock duo adapting their personal stories for the stage.

Opinion,Trump Got His Wish. Mexico Is Now the Wall.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/07/opinion/international-world/mexico-migrants.html,"Mexico is now the wall. President Trump got his wish. The heart-wrenching images documenting a recent confrontation in the state of Chiapas, near the border with Guatemala, are evidence of this. Dozens of Mexican National Guard troops equipped with helmets, batons and transparent shields coalesced on the highway connecting the Mexican cities of Ciudad Hidalgo and Tapachula to stop a caravan of migrants heading to the United States from Central America. The guardsmen used pepper spray on the caravan, which as of mid-January included about 4,000 people, many of them women and children. In the end, hundreds were detained, sent back to Guatemala or deported to Honduras. A spokeswoman for the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights condemned the actions of the National Guard, saying that the use of force to stop and disperse immigrants should be avoided. Mexico has effectively turned into an extension of Mr. Trump's immigration police beyond American territory. And this is the case on multiple fronts: On the southern border with Guatemala, they prevent Central American migrants from coming into Mexico; on the northern one, they block those seeking entry to the United States from leaving. The decision of Mexico's President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, also known as AMLO, to follow this approach is misguided. He should let migrants continue their journey north. Under the Migrant Protection Protocols program, which the Trump administration introduced in January 2019, asylum seekers who attempt to enter the United States at the U.S.-Mexico border may be required to stay in Mexico while the authorities make a decision regarding their case. As of November 2019, over 56,000 people had been sent back to Mexico to wait for the outcome of their applications, according to Human Rights Watch.

This is a radical change in immigration policy for the United States. In the past, Central American asylum seekers were allowed to remain on American soil while waiting for their cases to be processed. Central American immigration has always been a source of frustration for the United States. But the most powerful country in the world holds a certain degree of responsibility for what goes on in its hemisphere, and it is perfectly capable of accepting the most vulnerable people on the continent. It has done it before, and can still do it. So when did the United States' problem become Mexico's problem? Everything changed because of Donald Trump. By mid-2019, a number of Central American caravans were traveling across Mexico. The president, comparing them to an invasion, warned Mexico that they should do something to stop them, and that he would slap tariffs on all Mexican imports if it didn't. ""Their right to make a living, to not be abused, to be protected, helped, and supported should be safeguarded,"" Mr. Lopez Obrador, then president-elect, said in October 2018 of the Central American migrants heading north. Unfortunately, he has since backtracked, pulling back on his promises to the migrants. When a journalist asked him during one of his daily news conferences about the harassment and intimidation of Central American migrants in southern Mexico, AMLO refused to take the victims' side. And Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, acting deputy secretary of Homeland Security, said that the Trump administration had seen more cooperation from Mexico ""than anyone thought was possible.""

Mr. Cuccinelli is right. Over a year ago, few would have thought that a leftist president like AMLO (author of a critical book titled ""Oye, Trump"" and defender of Central Americans crossing Mexico) would suddenly become Mr. Trump's main ally in immigration matters. Mr. Lopez Obrador has said that he favors a ""peace and love"" policy toward the United States and will avoid confrontation with Mr. Trump. There's nothing wrong with wanting a good relationship with a powerful neighbor who also happens to be your main trade partner. But we should also remember that Mexico has been exporting immigrants to the United States for decades. Millions of us live on American soil. That's why I am surprised by the indifference shown by so many Mexicans over the abuses of the National Guard and the vicious attacks on social media aimed at Central Americans. Those xenophobic comments remind me of those I have been hearing for decades here in the United States, and of the appalling mistreatment of Mexican immigrants in recent years. Such abuses should not be forgotten or used to justify a similar treatment of migrants in Mexico. Northward migration is hardly a new phenomenon. For decades it has provided the United States with a much-needed labor force, and the migrants and refugees who put everything on the line to make the journey with an opportunity to improve their lives. I am fully aware that the American immigration system is far from perfect. It is in dire need of a complete makeover. But Mexico shouldn't be an extension of the Border Patrol. That makes things worse for everybody. What should Mexico be doing with migrants from Central America? Just let them go through and protect them as they do so, instead of repressing them. They are fleeing extreme poverty and gang violence. Their only hope is to get to the United States. The Trump administration, not the Lopez Obrador administration, should be receiving them and deciding whether they should be granted political asylum.

Media,"Mobile Apps Are Musts for Most Brands, as Long as Users Like Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/17/business/media/mobile-apps-advertising.html,"Mobile Apps Are Musts for Most Brands, as Long as Users Like Them

Jared Guynes has hundreds of apps on his mobile phone. So when Mr. Guynes, a 34-year-old from Rockwall, Tex., took his family to Chili's Grill & Bar and saw an ad offering free chips and salsa if he downloaded the restaurant's app, he didn't hesitate. Then, within minutes of leaving the restaurant last month, he received a flurry of push notifications: one offering another discount, one asking him to take a survey and a third asking to add his location. ""I thought, chill out Chili's,"" said Mr. Guynes, who said he was considering deleting the app. ""Let me get home and digest the food."" (Chili's did not respond to a request for comment.) The brand app is no longer just a gimmick to assuage smartphone-addicted millennials. It's considered a crucial part of a company's financial strategy. Shoppers in the United States were expected to make $118 billion in retail purchases through their smartphones in 2018, up from $13.4 billion in 2013, according to Forrester Analytics.

""If you're a brand and you don't have an app strategy or you aren't investing in your app development, then its going to be really hard for you to engage and monetize the fastest growing population, which are mobile shoppers,"" said Jon Hudson, vice president of customer solutions and innovation at Criteo, a digital marketing and technology firm. But as more companies bombard shoppers with emails, fliers and in-store ads that push them to download their brand apps, people are getting savvier -- and less forgiving if they feel an app's performance is subpar. There is little hesitation about dumping a brand app that is slow, crashes, has a poor layout, doesn't offer exclusive sales or promotions, or pushes too many notifications. A recent study by the digital product developer WillowTree Inc., showed almost half of those surveyed found 50 percent or fewer of the brand apps to be useful after downloading them. And about 22 percent had deleted more than half of their brand apps. Apps can be valuable tools for companies. They can track a customer's interests by seeing the person's browsing and buying activity, and then use the data to customize ads, discounts and promotions to keep the customer coming back. Many brands are even using machine learning or artificial intelligence to fine-tune their promotions.

To entice people to download an app, companies often offer one-time discounts, entry into a sweepstakes giveaway, or registration into a warranty program. But getting people to come back requires more.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. More than 60 percent of the people in the WillowTree survey said they wanted exclusive access to sales, limited edition products, and events, and to be rewarded with loyalty points or other perks for making a purchase through the app. And navigating the app must be simple. Panera Bread's app has been a hit, with more than 5 million downloads and 1.5 million people opening the app each month. The app makes it fast and easy for people to place orders, track food deliveries in real-time, and get MyPanera loyalty rewards when they place orders through the app, said Blaine Hurst, the company's chief executive. It also offers other features, like its nutritional calculator which tallies up calories, fat and other metrics as the person custom builds a sandwich. Panera expects to receive $250 million in sales through its app this year. Giving customers a reason to come back to the app on a daily or weekly basis is critical to its success. ""If the app isn't really bringing an experience or providing constantly-changing data or some sort of loyalty, users aren't going to be driven to the app,"" said Eric MacKenzie, the vice president of technology at the digital marketing agency R2i. Regal Cinemas overhauled its app in January 2016 to allow customers to buy tickets directly through the app instead of redirecting customers to the Fandango site. This made it faster and easier to buy tickets and led to a surge in people joining Regal's loyalty program. It sends notifications about new movies, contests or even free studio screenings based on a person's past purchases. A superhero buff, for instance, most likely received notifications when tickets for ""Deadpool 2"" went on sale, said Ken Thewes, Regal's chief marketing officer. Regal frequently adds perks, like the augmented reality feature it recently introduced. More than 9 million people have downloaded the app. The Walgreens app has been downloaded more than 50 million times and has 5 million people actively using it each month. Users come to the app for its discount coupons as well as helpful pharmacy features, such as daily pill reminders, notifications for prescription refills, the ability to speak with pharmacists through Pharmacy Chat, and loyalty rewards points for those who use the app to track walking, cycling, weight management, and other activities, said Adam Holyk, chief marketing officer at Walgreens.","Apps have become a critical part of companies' financial strategies, but people are getting savvier about them and less forgiving if they think their performance is subpar.",4e8d4f40-485d-5cc4-b8c8-296c0adbd7ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/18/business/18ADCO/18ADCO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e9ea6212dcb5f9924095cb939145b89cfd064c0b647d5c6900cd052feedea30e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Regal Cinemas said that more than 9 million people have downloaded its app, which, among other things, allows them to purchase movie tickets.",4e8d4f40-485d-5cc4-b8c8-296c0adbd7ac,N24News/imgs/4e8d4f40-485d-5cc4-b8c8-296c0adbd7ac.jpg,16
Style,Sandra Lee Has Her Own Message for America,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/sandra-lee-cooking-coronavirus.html,"Sandra Lee was horrified by the contents of my pantry. ""Girl, you're in trouble,"" she said, after demanding that I send her photos of every shelf. ""What I love the most is how many beans you have,"" she said. (I'm allergic, which is probably why they're still there.) But Ms. Lee, the former Food Network personality and cookbook author, is the queen of making something out of nothing, and assured me she would find a way out of my cupboard quandary. After all, she built a brand on ""semi-homemade"" recipes that rely on affordable, store-bought products -- the same ones we are now dusting off and defrosting in the face of a global pandemic. Ms. Lee, 53, recalled a time when she and her former partner, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, were watching football at their home in Westchester County during a snowstorm. There was nothing in the fridge, so she insisted they go out. ""He looked at me and he said, 'You're Sandra Lee. Just go whip something up,'"" she said. She made garlic knots.

""You know, nobody has a daily routine right now,"" Ms. Lee said. ""I get up and I see what the latest news is. Of course I watch Andrew live"" -- on the governor's daily coronavirus briefings, which have drawn a captive audience -- ""and then share with him my thoughts."" She said she and Mr. Cuomo still communicate nearly every day. (The governor was unavailable for comment. In a statement sent through his office shortly after publication, a spokesperson said: ""The Governor wishes her well in her next endeavor and we're sure it will be a success."") Ms. Lee's companion at home is a majestic white cockatoo named Phoenix, a gift from Mr. Cuomo when they were still a couple. ""He's getting bored,"" she said of the bird. His main preoccupation these days has been chewing on wooden clothespins. Humans, at least, can cook to pass the time, and Ms. Lee would like to show them how. Her new series is called ""Top Shelf,"" which, to be clear, isn't about fancy ingredients. ""Nobody's eating Wagyu,"" she said. Rather, it's that stuff some Americans may have forgotten about in their pantries, practically unreachable, waiting for the end times that seemed to arrive all at once just weeks ago.

In a sense, Ms. Lee is the perfect guide for this moment. She will change the way you think about a package of $2 Peeps (they can be used on cakes, to garnish cocktails or hidden in eggs in the garden), explain that if you separate two-ply toilet paper into single ply it lasts twice as long and pour you a heavy vodka and fresh grapefruit when it's all over, which is what she was drinking during one of our calls. Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.

* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. ""She loves to problem-solve, so she's a great person to call when the stuff hits the fan,"" her longtime friend Dr. Rosemarie Ingleton, a dermatologist in Manhattan, said over the phone this week. Sandra Lee grew up on food stamps, bouncing between homes after her mother dropped her and a younger sister off at her grandmother's house when Sandra was 2 and didn't return for several years. She learned to be creative with cooking in part to stretch her family's welfare checks and help care for three more siblings who arrived. ""We made simple bargain cuisine, not because we wanted to, but because we had to,"" she wrote in her 2007 memoir, ""Made From Scratch."" Eventually, Ms. Lee turned that thriftiness into a business: first with a curtain line started in the bedroom of her aunt and uncle's house and later with a QVC show, and eventually, a cooking empire.

Her first show on Food Network, ""Semi-Homemade Cooking,"" ran for 15 seasons, showcasing recipes that were accessible, attainable and affordable, using 70 percent store-bought ingredients and 30 percent homemade. When the recession hit, in 2008, Ms. Lee introduced a second show, ""Money Saving Meals,"" which taught parents how to feed a family of four for $4. (Leftovers were called ""round two"" recipes.) ""I mean, the beautiful thing about being raised Jehovah's Witness is always in the back of your mind, Armageddon is coming,"" Ms. Lee said of her childhood, in which her mother became a follower of the millenarian Christian movement. ""So your pantry's always stocked.""

""She and Andrew accomplished a lot together,"" said a sister, Kimber Lee, noting that she had been an advocate for marriage equality and the legalization of medical marijuana. In 2015, Ms. Lee was diagnosed with breast cancer and opted for a double mastectomy. She chronicled the experience in the 2018 documentary ""Rx: Early Detection, A Cancer Journey With Sandra Lee,"" and became an outspoken proponent of early cancer screening. (She said that she remains, thankfully, cancer-free.) Ms. Lee and Mr. Cuomo announced their split in September, after 14 years together, but remain close. (""He's still my guy,"" she said. ""Neither one of us, well as far as I know, has had a date."") She has a good relationship with his daughters, and has been directing prospective donors of P.P.E. and hand sanitizer to 25-year-old Cara, who is helping her father with relief coordination. ""They're my family, and they always will be my family,"" Ms. Lee said. ""We share a home, we share children, we share friendship,"" she said of Mr. Cuomo. ""I will protect him and be there for him until the day I die."" Ms. Lee was long Mr. Cuomo's defender when New Yorkers on both sides of the political aisle were critical of his record. But these days, many have warmed to him as a leader, and in sometimes surprising ways. Last week a theory spread across the internet about a photo of the governor in which ... something could be discerned beneath his white polo shirt. ""A nipple ring? What did you just say?"" Ms. Lee said, eyes wide. Later she appeared in a video on Facebook alluding to ""nonsense"" online and telling body-shamers to ""knock it off!""

There have, and always will be, Sandra Lee detractors, including those who have scoffed at her use of artificial ingredients as well as her particular combinations of them. ""It is difficult to understand how a responsible author could choose a tasteless, industrial cheese like Velveeta to prepare what she calls 'gourmet-tasting' food,"" wrote the former New York Times food writer Amanda Hesser as Ms. Lee prepared to release her second cookbook. Anthony Bourdain famously called her ""Kwanzaa cake,"" which called for angel food cake, vanilla frosting, popcorn and corn nuts, a ""crime against humanity."" ""I'm not sure that some of the food purists are in touch with what really goes on in American households,"" Ms. Lee told The Times in 2012.

These days, Ina Garten is making oversize quarantine cocktails. Food Network is offering quarantine recipes, and Americans are flocking to familiar processed foods, like SpaghettiOs, Spam and Cheetos. Even Mr. Cuomo is delivering lengthy monologues about the comfort of spaghetti and meatballs. ""I think there's been an immediate shift for all of us in what we think of as 'enough,'"" said Samin Nosrat, the food writer and Netflix host, who recently created a podcast about how to cook with what's in your pantry. Ms. Nosrat, the author of ""Salt Fat Acid Heat"" (and an occasional New York Times contributor), said she has noticed herself become much more conscientious about rationing, and less snobby about, say, which brand of canned tomatoes she chooses. ""I'm first to admit, I always denigrated that style of cooking,"" she said of Ms. Lee's brand of prepackaged goods. ""But I have to say, doing everything from scratch in these circumstances is bananas."" Ms. Lee said that, right now, food is about survival, not luxury. ""I think you just have to figure out how to do with what you have and how to make it the best you can,"" she said. ""You have to see what's there, not what's not there."" In her own home, what's there is cans of cream of celery, cream of mushroom, cream of potato: ""great bases for anything you want and they all last forever,"" she said.

There is also popcorn, nuts, stacks on stacks of tomato sauces, a variety of canned soups. ""I like chicken noodle soup just because I like it, and I like it with saltines, especially when I don't feel well,"" she said, pointing to the saltines. There are artichokes. ""My favorite, my favorite thing,"" she said. Pasta, vegetable stock, Bisquick, Red Lobster brand cheddar biscuit mix. ""I only have that because my aunt loves it,"" she said. And she is well-stocked for Easter, with chocolate bunnies, toy bunnies, marshmallow bunnies, bunny cookies, jelly beans, licorice, fresh-cut lilies, and of course a whole ham, which she plans to roast for dinner. The ham leftovers, she said, she will make into a ""decadent, cheesy casserole"" -- a perfect round two recipe.","The former ""first girlfriend"" of New York wants to teach the homebound how to subsist on affordable staples.",b6fad8e3-8e6d-5347-8a9b-1c289ea174ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/11/fashion/11SANDRALEE1/11SANDRALEE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fdba8b5381856f59bd04cb72f7166a34599e3225b74ff4a31f96bdb859c2e673&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sandra Lee and Phoenix, her pet cockatoo.",b6fad8e3-8e6d-5347-8a9b-1c289ea174ab,N24News/imgs/b6fad8e3-8e6d-5347-8a9b-1c289ea174ab.jpg,15
Science,Tales of African-American History Found in DNA,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/28/science/african-american-dna.html,"The history of African-Americans has been shaped in part by two great journeys. The first brought hundreds of thousands of Africans to the southern United States as slaves. The second, the Great Migration, began around 1910 and sent six million African-Americans from the South to New York, Chicago and other cities across the country. In a study published on Friday, a team of geneticists sought evidence for this history in the DNA of living African-Americans. The findings, published in PLOS Genetics, provide a map of African-American genetic diversity, shedding light on both their history and their health. Buried in DNA, the researchers found the marks of slavery's cruelties, including further evidence that white slave owners routinely fathered children with women held as slaves. And there are signs of the migration that led their descendants away from such oppression: Genetically related African-Americans are distributed closely along the routes they took to leave the South, the scientists discovered.

The importance of that finding is not just historical, said Dr. Esteban G. Burchard, a physician and scientist at the University of California, San Francisco, who was not involved in the study. A detailed map of genetic variations in African-Americans will help show how genes influence their risk for various diseases. ""This has tremendous medical relevance,"" he said. Until recently, most research into the link between genes and disease has focused on people of European descent. ""We're missing out on a lot of biology and diversity,"" said Simon Gravel, a geneticist at McGill University in Montreal. The history of African-Americans poses special challenges for geneticists. During the slave trade, their ancestors were captured from genetically diverse populations across a portion of West Africa. Adding to the complexity is the fact that living African-Americans also may trace some of their ancestry to Europeans and Native Americans. In the new study, Dr. Gravel and his colleagues analyzed the DNA of 3,726 African-Americans who participated in three separate medical studies.

The scientists were able to pinpoint stretches of DNA in the subjects that originated on different continents. According to their calculations, the ancestors of the average African-American today were 82.1 percent African, 16.7 percent European and 1.2 percent Native American. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues also estimated when those genes were introduced. When two parents from different ethnic backgrounds have a family, their children share long stretches of identical DNA. Over the generations, the stretches get smaller. The lengths serve as a kind of genealogical clock. Most of the Native American DNA identified by Dr. Gravel and his colleagues in African-Americans occurs now in tiny chunks. The scientists concluded that most of the mingling between Africans and Native Americans took place soon after the first slaves arrived in the American colonies in the early 1600s. The European DNA in African-Americans, on the other hand, occurs in slightly longer chunks, indicating a more recent origin. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues estimate that its introduction dates to the decades before the Civil War. The scientists gave some attention to the X chromosome in particular because of its role in sex determination. One X chromosome is inherited from mothers; fathers may contribute a Y or X. The researchers observed that the X chromosome of African-Americans has a greater African ancestry than other chromosomes. Dr. Gravel and his colleagues believe this variation is explained by European men and African women producing children -- in other words, slave owners raping the women they held captive. The databases that Dr. Gravel and his colleagues studied also included information about where the subjects now live. The scientists used this information to help trace the movements of African-Americans through the United States.

They found very strong genetic connections between African-Americans in the Deep South and those in the Northeast and Midwest. The genetic similarities in African-Americans tend to cluster along the very train lines that their forebears took as they left the Jim Crow South: the Illinois Central to Chicago, for example, and the Atlantic Coast line up the East Coast. The scientists were intrigued to find that European Americans who live in the South now are more closely related to African-Americans in the North or West than to present-day African-Americans in the South. Dr. Gravel has proposed a surprising explanation: ""The first people to migrate out of the South were the ones with the most European ancestry,"" he said. Alondra Nelson, the dean of social science at Columbia University and the author of ""The Social Life of DNA: Race, Reparations, and Reconciliation after the Genome"" said she did not think that result contributed much to understanding who left the South or why. In the study, she noted, the researchers found just 1 percent more European ancestry in the African Americans who left the South. Dr. Nelson noted that historians are increasingly collaborating on genetic studies like these. But the new study does not include a historian among its authors.",Geneticists have studied clues in the DNA of African-Americans about the history of slavery and the Great Migration.,cf0e2399-e76b-5bca-b36d-02c12bcbd1a4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/28/science/28ZIMMER/28ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=618e2487fd7441d9e40301e28332e20e9211b1cbdbf3fbb5472c5536806eb45d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"African American men, women and children, who took part in The Great Migration in Chicago in 1918.",cf0e2399-e76b-5bca-b36d-02c12bcbd1a4,N24News/imgs/cf0e2399-e76b-5bca-b36d-02c12bcbd1a4.jpg,2
Real Estate,"House Hunting in Turks and Caicos: A Villa on the Beach for $795,000",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/realestate/house-hunting-in-turks-and-caicos-a-villa-on-the-beach-for-795000.html,"House Hunting in Turks and Caicos: A Villa on the Beach for $795,000

This three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom house reaches into the turquoise waters of Chalk Sound on the southern side of Providenciales, the most developed island in the Turks and Caicos archipelago. Known as Owl's Nest, the half-acre property is about 10 miles west of Grace Bay, a popular resort and beach area. Built in 1992 and renovated two years ago, the two-story, 3,538-square-foot, cedar-frame house has hurricane-rated windows and doors, as well as a 100-foot-long boardwalk that leads to a dock and sun deck. The house enjoys ""benefits from the reduced setbacks that have been grandfathered in,"" said Sean O'Neill, managing director of Caribbean development and operations for the Agency, which has the listing. ""As a result, the property sits right on the Sound.""

A spiral staircase divides the upstairs living and sleeping areas. The living room has a vaulted ceiling and several doors out to the deck. At the other end is the master bedroom, also with doors leading outside. A step-up tub with an aqua-mosaic-tile surround and an adjoining shower are open to the bedroom, with a separate commode and vanity. The second bedroom is also en suite. The third bedroom, a converted den, has twin bunk beds. The house is being sold furnished. Each room has a ceiling fan. ""The house was built and designed to make the most of the natural air,"" Mr. O'Neill said, with prevailing winds from the southeast cooling the interiors. Downstairs, the fully equipped eat-in kitchen has a wood-laminate center island with a double sink and breakfast bar. There is also a powder room, a laundry room and storage. Two sets of sliding doors open from the kitchen to a covered travertine patio.

The market is booming in Turks and Caicos, a British Overseas Territory in the Atlantic Ocean with about 50,000 residents. The archipelago has become ""a strong region for investment in second and third homes over the last few years,"" Mr. O'Neill said. ""Building codes, convenient air-travel options from the United States and Canada, and use of the U.S. dollar have proven key to our recent success."" Listing prices across the islands range from $140,000 for an acre of ocean-view land to $18.8 million for a single-family house, he said, while condos range from about $155,000 to $5.5 million. Although the number of sales slipped from 359 in 2018 to 344 in 2019, gross sales prices rose from $250 million to $334 million year over year, according to data from the Turks and Caicos Real Estate Association and Multiple Listing Service. The average sales price of $970,429 in 2019 was a 34 percent jump from the average of $722,039 in 2018.

Joe Zahm, the president of Turks and Caicos Sotheby's International Realty, said 2019 was ""a record-shattering year"" for prices. ""It has been a steady trend upward, especially in new developments that closed,"" Mr. Zahm said, noting that sales of a few trophy listings, including Bruce Willis's estate for $27 million and Prince's former estate for $10.8 million, affected 2019 totals. Turks and Caicos has ""captured the imagination of a well-heeled customer,"" said Mark Durliat, a founder and the chief executive of Grace Bay Resorts, adding that many luxury buyers are attracted to the islands' two fixed-base operators for private jets. ""We are seeing some very substantial activity we didn't have before.""

In some ways, the islands' status as ""a real global luxury brand"" was ""accelerated by Irma,"" the 2017 hurricane that caused extensive damage, Mr. Zahm said, because the islands recovered faster than some of their Caribbean neighbors. Thanks to building codes that include modern technologies, hurricane-proof windows and solid concrete buildings, ""90 percent of our real estate survived, most of it unscathed,"" said Robert Greenwood, a partner at Regency-Christie's International Real Estate and a former president of Turks and Caicos Real Estate Association. ""That also goes toward people's increasing desire for the Turks."" Stronger dollar-wise than it was before 2008, the Turks and Caicos market has also been helped by a robust United States economy. Still, the average time a home spends on the market is a little more than a year, with properties priced over $1 million lingering more than two years.

""Because a lot of the properties for sale are also income-generating rental properties, the motivation to sell is not really there,"" Mr. O'Neill said. ""They are willing to entertain offers if the right number comes along."" He added: ""With the advent of VRBO and Airbnb, the day of the holiday home is gone."" While single-family homes have traditionally dominated the market, inroads are being made by resort-linked villas and villa clusters, gated enclaves with handfuls of homes that share amenities like gyms, beach service and a management company that facilitates rentals.

At the Villas at Turquoise Banks, a new cluster community of homes priced under $5 million on Long Bay Beach, the three- and four-bedrooms come with solar panels, power walls and a Model 3 Tesla. ""Condos remain hot, but there is an evolution of baby boomers,"" Mr. Greenwood said. ""They want more villas. Privacy is the new luxury."" At the 14-acre Rock House resort, on the northern coast, prices range from $700,000 for a studio to $1.9 million for a 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom, three-bathroom penthouse, Mr. Durliat said. Amenities include a spa and beach club, plus ferry service to Grace Bay Club's main resort. Who Buys in Turks and Caicos Most buyers are from eastern North America, mainly Toronto, Montreal, Boston, New York, the Carolinas, Atlanta and Florida, agents said. The number of buyers from Houston and Chicago spiked with new air service. Flights from London Gatwick connect twice a week in Antigua. ""Because of private planes, buyer demographics are broader than our feeder markets,"" Mr. Zahm said. ""Texas has discovered us in summer to beat the heat. We do surprising business from California and western and eastern Canada.""","With its strong building codes, convenient air-travel and use of the American dollar, the Caribbean archipelago is thriving as a destination for buyers and renters.",a3758412-0d25-545a-8a33-5bdc0aa3ed22,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/22/realestate/22IHH-Turks-slide-QMV0/22IHH-Turks-slide-QMV0-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fae5468eac961b1df875e45b6942290461017cc5b520a21c0df5e1c6fa0b6d4e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A 100-foot boardwalk leads from the house to a sun deck on Chalk Sound.,a3758412-0d25-545a-8a33-5bdc0aa3ed22,N24News/imgs/a3758412-0d25-545a-8a33-5bdc0aa3ed22.jpg,7
Your Money,Dealing With a Client Who Calls and Calls and ...,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/your-money/what-to-do-about-the-troublesome-client.html,"A LOT of us are self-employed these days -- whether by choice or necessity -- and eager to attract as many clients as possible. And that sometimes means agreeing to work with people who are, to put it mildly, challenging. It's tough to turn down business, especially when you're trying to build up a reputation and a bank account. But difficult customers can cost more than they're worth in time, stress and even cash if they don't pay their bills or use the precious time that could be devoted to building a larger client base. I've thought about this a lot recently in trying to decide whether to take on a job to help write a book. The offer is from someone I don't really know and who lives in another country, but the pay seems good and the work interesting. This could turn out to be a great gig or a quagmire of time and sanity. So I posed the question of problem clients, and what to do about them, to friends and on various Web sites that cater to the rising number of freelancers. According to the Freelancers Union, a membership organization that provides advocacy, education and services such as insurance, about 42 million Americans are ""independent workers."" That's one-third of the work force.

The consensus among those who responded? Don't ignore warning signs, even if you really want the work. ""Many years ago when I started my practice I needed clients and I did not have any, so I took anyone with a pulse and money. I totally ignored their bad attitudes,"" Jay Malik, a tax strategist and wealth manager specializing in doctors, said in an e-mail. He soon realized, however, that if he kept doing that he would spend so much time on the demanding clients that he couldn't expand his practice -- and he would be miserable. ""So I stopped signing up the bad ones,"" he wrote. ""The mere fact of knowing that I could say no to problem clients helped me psychologically and boosted my self-esteem."" Sometimes it is just a niggling sense that something is off and this person may be tough to work with. Sometimes it's more.

""I had a call from a client who spent an hour telling me about personal problems and my gut was saying this was going to turn into a fiasco if I took her on,"" said Amy, a Web designer who asked that her last name not be used as she is still wary of stirring up trouble with this particular former customer. ""I am a people-pleaser, though, and I tend to want to help, so I took the job on anyway,"" she said. ""Things started out O.K., but slowly started to dissolve until ultimately I had to break up with the client."" And at that point, she said, the hours she had put in for this customer far exceeded what had been paid for. All agreed that bad clients were not worth it. So how to spot them? One red flag is if they have unrealistic expectations. For example, Wes McDowell, who owns The Deep End, a graphic design firm, said he probably would not take on a client who told him he had worked with several other designers and wasn't satisfied with any. ""I had one client who said he went to five designers,"" he said. ""I made him show me the previous work, which was fine. I took the project, but after Round 1, he pulled the plug."" Other signs? Rudeness. Hostility or outrage at your prices (it is all right to negotiate cost, but in a professional manner). Disrespect for your work. Having no idea what they want.

""I look for 'warning words' in the discovery interview,"" Emily Worden, a freelance copywriter, wrote in an e-mail. ""Whenever someone tells me, 'I dabble in writing myself' or 'This just needs some polishing up' alarm bells start ringing. Why? Someone who 'dabbles in writing' thinks they could do a great job themselves and they'll micromanage you or worse, not pay what you're worth. Also, any time clients downplay the amount of work required for a project, double or triple the estimated time. They don't know how much work 'polishing up' takes and you need to charge accordingly."" Of course, what may be right for one person may not be for another. Some people are willing to be available day and night. Others, not so much. ""I find anyone who reaches out trying to hire me at 10 o'clock at night or later, or on the weekend -- I'm automatically going to pass,"" Carol Tice, a business journalist and author of ""The Pocket Small Business Owner's Guide to Starting Your Business on a Shoestring,"" wrote in an e-mail. ""These are dysfunctional people who work 24/7 -- and will want you to be available at all hours. Requests for my I.M. address so they can ding me all the time also makes me pass,"" she added. ""I did have one client like this who I took because she was a contractor for a Fortune 500 in my town that I wanted to work for. But it proved my rule, she was a nightmare!"" Kim Laudati, who owns her own skin care salon in Manhattan, said she would not treat clients who expected her to work miracles. ""People will come in and request that I take off 10 years immediately,"" she said. ""Even heavy-duty laser treatment won't do that."" Putting in protective clauses in contracts can help in damage control, such as limiting the number of times a customer can come back to you for additional work without paying more.

Mr. McDowell, who also published an e-book called ""Get Graphic Design Clients,"" said his contract stipulates that he will do three rounds of revision for a client, and he makes it very clear in his e-mails which revision he is on so there are no misunderstandings. ""In the subject line, I say, 'Logo concept, Round 2,' "" he said. A sound contract is not only good practice, but will also drive away clients you probably would not want. ""When I first started my company, our contracts were weak and enabled clients to walk all over us if they were so inclined,"" wrote Kari DePhillips, co-owner of the Content Factory, a digital public relations firm. ""Now our contracts are much stronger."" She asks for a portion of her fee before she starts the work, for example. ""If they won't pay at least 50 percent up front, chances are good that they won't want to pay after the project is completed."" A client of Ms. DePhillips once lured away one of her best coordinators, so she also has inserted a ""no poaching clause,"" in all contracts. There is an additional $20,000 fee if a client hires a member of her company within six months of the end of the contract. ""You have to trust your own authority -- know what you want from a client and what you're worth,"" said Sara Horowitz, founder of the Freelancers Union. ""Do your homework. Know the industry rate. Think about how this gig fits in with your whole portfolio -- is it a one-off or maybe the start of a long relationship? Trust yourself to build a diverse roster of clients that works for you long term, not just today."" It's not always easy to ""fire"" a client or even let a potential one know you don't want to work with her. The best advice is to be kind but direct.

""No matter how unrealistic or rude, they are obviously coming from a place of need,"" Ms. Laudati said. Sometimes she will refer such clients to a competitor who, she said, is more willing than she is to take on such customers. That seems to be a common practice. So is the catchall phrase ""This probably isn't a good fit."" Shaun Eli, a comedian and executive director of the Ivy League of Comedy, which provides comedians for events, said if it was clear a client would be difficult, ""I tack on another $500 to the cost of the show. Because usually their issues show through long before I have enough information to quote them a price. Sometimes it's enough to discourage them. Sometimes not. But then when they're annoying, contradictory or argumentative, I can smile because at least I'm being paid to put up with their issues."" I'm still not sure what to do about the prospective book client, but I'm certainly going to carefully consider the potential downsides. No one needs more crazy and demanding people in their lives -- after all, isn't that what family is for?",A constant problem for freelancers and small-business owners is deciding whether to turn down business from a demanding customer.,80038669-0da0-53dc-b5eb-5707c8c51656,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/19/business/Shortcuts/Shortcuts-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=533&w=600&s=364cceb3d003ebb44e5db7fc17345ddebf76e661db1b8293c89269d455366eeb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Shaun Eli, executive director of the Ivy League of Comedy, said that when a potential client seems argumentative he adds $500 to the cost of the show.",80038669-0da0-53dc-b5eb-5707c8c51656,N24News/imgs/80038669-0da0-53dc-b5eb-5707c8c51656.jpg,21
Global Business,Rules to Ban Menthol and Slim Cigarettes Divide Europeans,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/business/global/tobacco-creates-new-east-west-divide-in-europe.html,"LONDON -- New rules to be discussed by European Union ministers on Friday would ban menthol and slim cigarettes, a move intended to improve the health of Europeans but one that has divided it broadly along cold war lines. Led by Poland, which also happens to be one of Europe's biggest tobacco producers, a bloc of former Communist countries is fighting a rear-guard action against the measures, hoping at least to save slim cigarettes, which are popular with many smokers, often women. The concern of the rule drafters is that slim cigarettes add an allure that attracts young women to smoking and that menthol cigarettes make it easier for young people of both sexes to start, and be hooked on, smoking. But Poland stands to lose tobacco industry jobs from the proposed law. Some Polish politicians also worry about seeming highhanded to their sizable number of smokers, an estimated one-third of the population.

""It's about freedom, to a large extent,"" said Roza Grafin von Thun und Hohenstein, a center-right Polish member of the European Parliament, who is known as Roza Thun. Ms. Thun said she supported the health impulses behind the draft legislation, but after listening to objections from voters at a meeting in Krakow she decided the rules should be relaxed. ""People said, 'When are you going to prohibit us from drinking wine or vodka, or stop us using white sugar? Maybe you will also tell us to go to bed early because going to bed late is also unhealthy.' "" The proposed rules would also require that pictures of smoking-related medical problems and written health warnings cover 75 percent of the front and the back of cigarette packs. This provision, though, may be scaled back after haggling among the European health ministers who will be debating the rules in Brussels. Any new regulations would require the approval of the European Parliament before becoming law. Tobacco has been a troublesome issue for the European Union's executive arm, the European Commission, which has run public health campaigns to cut smoking but only recently removed direct agricultural subsidies for growing tobacco.

""Approximately 700,000 Europeans die every single year of tobacco-related causes,"" Ireland's health minister, James Reilly, said in a speech this year. ""Smoking is the largest avoidable health risk in Europe, causing more problems than alcohol, drug abuse and obesity.""
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday.
* The high cost of gas is forcing families to cut back on activities and essentials.
* Clearview AI does well in another round of facial recognition accuracy tests. The public health care cost attached to smoking in Europe is an estimated 25.3 billion euros ($33.4 billion) each year, Mr. Reilly said. He cited recent studies showing that 70 percent of smokers in Europe began their habit before age 18. A particular worry behind the proposal is that thinner or menthol-flavored cigarettes look and taste less harmful than others, giving people a misleading impression that they are safer. In Poland, menthol cigarettes make up 18 percent of cigarette consumption, with slim cigarettes adding an additional 14 percent, according to the Polish government. ""I think we should not be too dogmatic,"" Ms. Thun said. ""We are dealing with human beings, their addictions and their habit. We should help the younger generation not to smoke, but I think we won't achieve anything with a hard line."" Przemyslaw Noworyta, director of the association that represents Polish tobacco growers, said the industry supported 60,000 jobs, many in areas with little alternative employment. Only Italy grows more tobacco in Europe than Poland.",Proposed rules would ban menthol and slim cigarettes to improve the Continent's health but could also divide it broadly along cold-war lines.,c24f6607-ac1f-5c93-ac61-4a40cd0dfbf4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/21/business/21tobacco/21tobacco-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=596&w=600&s=61f1852b04198fbb7b089c466b98f85b879e77e0b7bcce90497c501232bddff7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Women smoking in Warsaw.

Technology,Turning Phone Videos Into GIFs,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/technology/personaltech/how-to-turn-phone-videos-into-gifs.html,"Q. How can I make one of those looping GIFs from a video clip on my phone? A. If you have a short video on your phone that you would like to transform into an animated GIF, using an app to edit and convert the file is one way to do so. Browse your phone's app store to see what is available. Many GIF-making tools list themselves as free products, but you usually have to pay a few dollars as an in-app purchase if you want to work without advertisements on the screen or remove the app developer's watermark from your finished creation.

Once you have selected and installed a GIF-making app on your phone, you typically start the process by opening the new app, pointing it to your phone's photo album and selecting the video clip you want to convert to an animated GIF. Depending on the app you are using, you may have the chance to trim the clip down to just a few important seconds of action or to indicate how many times you want the animation to repeat (or ""loop"") when played. Some apps also provide options to set image quality and file size when you export the finished GIF. Lower-quality files tend to work better for mobile messaging because they upload more quickly and eat through less of your data plan.

You can also make video loops or animated GIFs from iOS Live Photos and through tools offered in social media apps such as Instagram, Snapchat and Tumblr. Over the past several years, animated GIFs have become increasingly popular around the world as a way to share a reaction or an important moment, especially in text messages, on social media and in chat apps. The looping, soundless GIF files work on just about any platform, and libraries of the files have been built into some third-party keyboards and other apps for quick access when texting. Several websites, including EzGif, also offer to convert video clips into animated GIFs, but you need to be comfortable uploading a personal file to a public web page. Giphy, a popular GIF repository, also hosts its own online conversion page, and even has its own studio to professionally create new material for clients. Tenor is another GIF collection site, if you are looking for premade creations. Personal Tech invites questions about computer-based technology to techtip@nytimes.com.

Style,Ellen Pao Is Not Done Fighting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/08/style/ellen-pao-gender-discrimination-silicon-valley-reset.html,"Every day, Ellen Pao receives written messages of support from all over: to her office, through her lawyers, over email, on LinkedIn, in postcards she keeps in a small wooden box on her desk. ""Thank you for paving the way for women to come forward,"" writes someone in Florida. ""Thank you for putting Silicon Valley on notice,"" reads another message. ""You were a pioneer."" ""I believe O'Reilly would still have a job except for steps taken by you and so many others."" She has heard from AJ Vandermeyden, the former Tesla engineer who is suing for gender discrimination; Susan Fowler, whose blog post about her time at Uber toppled its C.E.O.; Niniane Wang, whose story of sexual harassment at the hands of a prominent investor led to his and a number of other resignations. And then there are those who collar her at school drop-off or in stairwells with their own tales of corporate horrors. ""Sometimes people just want you to tell them they'll get through it,"" Ms. Pao said. ""Sometimes they want specific advice. Sometimes it's hard -- our connection is through something so unpleasant. But you've been through something that really binds you.""

Ms. Pao, 47, was the junior venture capital partner and former interim C.E.O. of Reddit who, in 2012, filed a gender discrimination suit against her employer at the time, the powerful venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers. In a case that captivated Silicon Valley, she accused her bosses of not promoting her because of her gender and retaliating against her for complaining. She turned down a seven-figure settlement to testify in a jury trial, seeking $16 million in lost wages and tens of millions in punitive damages. Ms. Pao lost. But in the process she gave many women in corporate America a crash course in gender discrimination (the subtle kind). ""I think in many ways it was an affirmation: that these aren't outliers, this is a very real problem,"" said the law professor Anita Hill, whose testimony against Clarence Thomas taught an early-1990s world what ""sexual harassment"" meant -- in turn prompting a flood of complaints to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. ""I called it at the time a 'gender-bias training for the nation,'"" said Joan C. Williams, who is a legal scholar and professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law and the founder of the center for WorkLife Law there. ""But I'm not sure the nation was paying that much attention, unfortunately."" Ms. Pao hopes they're paying attention now. This month, she is releasing a book, ""Reset,"" chronicling the details of her lawsuit and its aftermath, which, she writes, ""almost ended my career in tech, cost me half a million dollars, and launched a thousand hit pieces on me and on my family."" It follows her time at Kleiner Perkins, from early days as chief of staff to John Doerr, a partner; the tangled affair with a married colleague she said harassed and retaliated against her; to the trial and what happened after, including the Reddit stint and her time now as an evangelist for corporate diversity and the co-founder and C.E.O. of a nonprofit called Project Include.

It is also the story of what led her, the daughter of Chinese immigrants to New Jersey, to this particular place. Ms. Pao is the middle of three girls, an introverted high achiever who got perfect scores on almost all her tests. Her mother, one of the first women to receive a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania, taught her to code: a skill Ms. Pao is now passing down to her own daughter, who is in elementary school. She majored in electrical engineering at Princeton, where her father, a math professor, had received his Ph.D., and then got degrees in law and business from Harvard. ""My family, except for my younger sister who was the indulged baby of the family, is generally very stoic,"" she writes. Ms. Pao today may speak of social justice, intersectional feminism, the difference between ""equality"" and ""equity,"" and the moral responsibility she felt to speak up (""I had the money and the conviction,"" she said). But she was a belated activist. In the book, she describes declining to join a sit-in at law school protesting professors' claims that African-Americans and women were not qualified to teach, because she didn't feel comfortable ""taking a side publicly."" Then came her first job out of law school: the male partner who'd brush up against female employees in the hallway, whom she tried to ignore; a female lawyer sent home for wearing pants; after-work trips to the strip club Scores.

""At the time, I tried not to think much about those incidents, hoping that just working hard and keeping my head down would help me push past and ignore them,"" she writes. By her own account, Ms. Pao was a rule follower. She chose not to hire a publicist during the trial and willingly turned over hundreds of thousands of emails to the opposing counsel, which she now regrets. She goes to church on Sundays, doesn't drink, and is extremely hesitant to talk about her personal life. Believing in meritocracy, she thought she could power through any inequity by working twice as hard. ""I had faith in the system,"" she writes. But Ms. Pao told of being excluded from meetings, undermined in front of clients, and among a group of women not invited to a company ski trip and a dinner with Al Gore because, as a senior partner put it, they would ""kill the buzz."" On another trip, trying valiantly to ""lean in,"" she joined a group of senior staffers at the front of a private jet, only to be subjected to talk about pornography and preferences in type of ""girls."" (Kleiner Perkins ""vigorously"" denied that any discrimination had occurred.) In written evaluations and performance reviews Ms. Pao was given high ratings, yet she was passed over for a senior-level promotion. She was criticized both for being too passive but also too pushy; for not speaking up enough but also being too opinionated.

""Everything was conflicting: You talk too much/not enough. You're too data-oriented/you don't bring enough information,"" Ms. Pao said, sitting in the shade of a roof deck at the Kapor Center, a social-impact fund where she is an investor and head of inclusion and diversity. She was sipping a glass of hot water. ""There was no consistency, and it was just baffling to me. How do I improve?"" Much of the behavior she experienced was inappropriate. But could it be proven illegal in court? Unclear. This wasn't overt pay discrimination or being barred from certain jobs because of her gender, the stuff of Title VII lawsuits of the 1970s or episodes of ""Mad Men."" This was a subtler sexism, the kind that ""day by day, water cooler comment by water cooler comment, microaggression by microaggression"" ate away at you, she writes. It was harder to document, to explain and ultimately to prove, but, she argues, just as damaging. ""Taken all together, these seemingly minor moments, these 1,000 paper cuts, create an unwelcome, subtly hostile culture,"" she writes. She sent a letter to her bosses outlining her complaints. They brought in a private investigator, who found no wrongdoing by the company. And so Ms. Pao sued, retaining the services of a lawyer who had won a $7 million sexual harassment case against a powerful Silicon Valley law firm in the 1990s. For five months, she also continued going to work. ""People can argue and do about the merits of the trial, but nobody can argue with her unflappable mental strength,"" said Ms. Wang, the founder and C.E.O. of Evertoon. Public support was sparse at first. At least one female founder told Newsweek the case was ""ridiculous"" and that she hoped Ms. Pao didn't ""get a dime,"" while in The New York Times, David Kaplan, the author of a book called ""The Silicon Boys,"" was quoted saying he was ""skeptical"" of the claims. Some worried the case would have a chilling effect on companies hiring women at all.

""I was toxic to people for a long time,"" Ms. Pao said. No court case is simple. But for those who hoped hers would serve as a watershed moment for Silicon Valley, Ms. Pao's was viewed as particularly complex. She was not particularly well-known. She declined to speak to the press. Female representation at Kleiner Perkins was bad (women made up 20 percent of investors, Mr. Doerr testified), but it was still better than the industry average of 6 percent. And then there was the matter of her private life, deemed irrelevant by the judge but nevertheless a subject of national news: specifically her marriage, to the hedge fund manager Alphonse Fletcher Jr., known as Buddy, who had previously been in a long-term relationship with a man, had sued two companies for racial discrimination and twice been accused of sexual harassment. He had recently filed a claim for bankruptcy. ""This is the right issue and the right time, but the wrong case,"" the defense would say repeatedly, led by a female lawyer, Lynn Hermle. But at the crux may have been the fact that her claims, to many women, almost seemed ordinary. The kind of stuff they put up with every day. Sarah Lacy, the founder and editor in chief of the tech website Pando, said: ""This wasn't a clear smoking gun -- and for this to be the big Silicon Valley trial over gender, she was hard to rally around.""

Ms. Lacy said she remembered thinking at the time that if Ms. Pao had a case, then so did every woman in America. ""I think ultimately the same thing that hurt her made women all look at their own lives very differently, and say, 'O.K., this is not acceptable. This should not be a part of doing business.'"" Before the verdict came in, the Yahoo president, Sue Decker, would write about how she had obsessively followed the case, even taking her daughters out of school for the closing arguments. A group of tech workers pooled their money to place a full-page ad in a Palo Alto newspaper that read, ""Thanks Ellen."" Ms. Pao may not be a natural leader. ""It's not my personality,"" she said, recounting going to see Steve Jobs speak and watching him be swarmed by people afterward. ""I remember thinking, 'Oh my god, I don't ever want that job.'"" Yet to a certain cohort she has become one, or at least a kind of mentor. Earlier this year, she appeared on stage with Anita Hill at a sold-out event in San Francisco. The Uber C.E.O. Travis Kalanick had not yet been fired, but he would be soon after; that week, the University of California, -Berkeley had announced it would pay $1.7 million to a woman who accused its former law school dean of sexual harassment and Bill O'Reilly had been fired from Fox News. Since then, dozens of women in Silicon Valley have come forward, speaking out about discrimination and harassment. Men have apologized, shot back, stepped down, created ""decency pledges,"" written manifestoes, been fired for manifestoes. The outcomes are different, but what founder after founder, lawyer after lawyer, academic after academic, keeps saying is the same: None of that would have been possible without Ellen Pao.

""I've been here since 1999,"" said Ms. Lacy. ""There is no one -- man, woman, founder, V.C., the most aggressive feminist, no one -- who would have thought a male V.C. would get fired for propositioning a woman. It's just a radical change."" Near Ms. Pao's office in Oakland, the street sign on the corner -- Broadway -- has been spray painted to read ""Bro Way."" On her way back from lunch, Ms. Pao laughed and snapped a photo. Later, she pulled up an email from a woman named Gesche Haas, an entrepreneur who had spoken publicly about being propositioned by an investor and emailed Ms. Pao to offer her support during the trial. ""There is this saying that all positive comments we receive we deflect like Teflon while negative comments we hang on to like Velcro,"" Ms. Haas wrote. ""Realizing that we do this helped me focus on the people that deserved my energy."" Ms. Pao has thought about these words more than once. ""It takes a village,"" she said.

Movies,"Now That Studio Ghibli Is Streaming on HBO Max, Where Do You Start?",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/16/movies/studio-ghibli-hbo-max.html,"Now That Studio Ghibli Is Streaming on HBO Max, Where Do You Start?

For decades, Studio Ghibli has broken mold after mold of what we expect films for kids to be. The Japanese animation house -- founded by the filmmakers Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata and Toshio Suzuki -- has spent 35 years telling winding, complex stories that stretch the bounds of what animation can do. In one, a treacherous battle rages between humans and the deities of a forest fighting to maintain the balance of nature. Another tale pits sorcerers against each other and questions the supernatural ethics of using magic in warfare. And one story opens up a transcendent and terrifying spirit world, in a work heralded by New York Times critics as one of the best films of the 21st century.

But Studio Ghibli has also, with impeccable consistency, struck a rare balance that most family-oriented movies struggle to achieve. These are undoubtedly children's movies -- but they also have a loyal following of adult fans, who devour their favorites over and over again. Now 21 of the studio's classics and lesser-known favorites are finding a new audience via HBO Max, the first time the films have been licensed to an American streaming platform. But if you haven't been stockpiling the DVDs for years, navigating such a hefty, wide-ranging catalog can be difficult. We're hoping to make that easier with a few starting points.

Taking in 21 of these movies can certainly feel overwhelming. So if you must pick only one, there's no debate: Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is essential viewing. The story, about a young girl who stumbles into a dark spirit world, goes beyond the imaginative limits of just about every other animated film, from Studio Ghibli or anyone else. The hero, Chihiro, spends much of the tale looking for a way out -- but by the end, you'll wish you could both stay just a little bit longer. It is filled with fantastical creatures, strange demons and a powerful sorceress looming over them all. ""Spirited Away"" is one of Miyazaki's most thrilling films, and by far his most immersive.

After that, try: ""Howl's Moving Castle"" (2004). There is a witch, a curse and a love story, but that's where the similarities between this Miyazaki film and all other fantasy stories end. The curse in question is on Sophie, a shy young hatmaker turned into a feeble, elderly woman. In her quest to break the spell and get back to her normal self, she joins an odd troop of characters -- including Howl, a powerful, shape-shifting wizard himself -- traveling in a roving steampunkish home. The whole adventure is enchanting, and even if you're not in the mood for fantasy, Billy Crystal's excellent performance as the English-language version's easily incensed fire demon, Calcifer, is reason enough to watch.

This Miyazaki film has one of Studio Ghibli's most lovable (human) characters in its young hero, Kiki -- an adolescent witch who leaves home, as all witches do at her age, to complete her magic training in a new town. With a bright red radio and talking black cat, Jiji, in tow, she starts a delivery service to sharpen her broom-flying skills and meets a delightful array of new friends along the way. Even with the magic elements, the story is less eccentric by Ghibli standards, with fewer vibrant spirits to digest. But the film is still a superb adventure, and one that is beautifully animated: The opening scene, of Kiki lying in the sun with her radio as the grass sways in the wind, is one of the studio's most breathtaking visuals.

After that, try: ""The Secret World of Arrietty"" (2010). That titular secret world is close by: Arrietty is no taller than a leaf, and her equally diminutive family lives under the floorboards of an old family home. The Borrowers, as they call themselves -- Hiromasa Yonebayashi's film is based on the children's novel by that name -- take only what they need from the human ""beans"" a few inches above them, one sugar cube or tissue at a time. Arrietty, turning 14, is impatient to go on borrowing adventures of her own, but her family's way of life is put at risk when a human boy with a keen eye moves in above. Like ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" the world that Yonebayashi builds is lovely on its own, but the real charm comes from watching the restless Arrietty come into her own.

""Totoro"" is one of Miyazaki's earliest films, and also one of his best. The touching story focuses on the sisters Satsuki and Mei, and the extraordinary characters they befriend outside their new home. Having two young protagonists (along with their massive, fluffy allies) makes this a great way to introduce small children to Studio Ghibli. But be warned: This one will just as easily suck in the adults.

After that, try: ""Ponyo"" (2008). Much like ""My Neighbor Totoro,"" this bright, colorful Miyazaki film focuses on younger characters, so it is another good entry point for children. Ponyo, a small, vaguely humanoid goldfish, has a brief yet delightful friendship with a 5-year-old boy, Sosuke, before returning to the sea. The encounter leaves an impact, and Ponyo, now with legs of her own, finds a way back to her friend, dancing atop waves of massive fish in a stunning sequence. It is one of Miyazaki's most joyous, bubbly works, and one that adults will find equally enthralling. (The cast is also wildly star-packed, including Matt Damon, Cate Blanchett, Tina Fey, Cloris Leachman, Liam Neeson, Lily Tomlin and Betty White.)

This is one of Miyazaki's greatest stories -- but it can, like any good supernatural battle for the soul of a forest, get a bit bloody. Princess Mononoke is not a name but rather a description of San, a human girl raised by wolves. She and the warrior prince Ashitaka become entangled in a bitter war between the animal gods of the forest and the humans using up its resources. This film is widely considered to be one of Studio Ghibli's essential classics for the intricacies of its story and the excellent animation, but go in knowing that it is much darker than its other works.

After that, try: ""Castle in the Sky"" (1986). There are no slow moments in ""Castle in the Sky."" The story is gripping from the start: Packed in the first few minutes alone are a kidnapping attempt, an attack from a crew of lovable airborne pirates and a girl magically floating down from the sky. From there, the film follows the quest of that girl, Sheeta, and her courageous new friend, Pazu, as they try to find a mythical levitating kingdom hidden in the clouds. Another perk: Mark Hamill.","If you're new to the riches of the Japanese animation studio, our guide can help you sort through its wonderfully deep catalog.",7ff8cc5f-96c5-548d-b9b4-bdbbd503c836,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/arts/19GHIBLI11/19GHIBLI11-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9a5b889c323a14b2a8650d2d048d842794a8c9cab1210d779e3e1918eb0a66e8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from top left, scenes from ""When Marnie Was There,"" ""Kiki's Delivery Service,"" ""Ponyo"" and ""Howl's Moving Castle.""",7ff8cc5f-96c5-548d-b9b4-bdbbd503c836,N24News/imgs/7ff8cc5f-96c5-548d-b9b4-bdbbd503c836.jpg,5
Technology,Instagram Is Changing Its Algorithm. Here's How.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/technology/instagram-algorithm-change.html,"Instagram is changing its algorithm to make things a little more timely.

Users are now likely to see newer posts higher up, the image-sharing app said in a statement on Thursday, adding that its feeds will ""feel more fresh."" Instagram's algorithm, in other words, won't be meddling quite as much. More images and videos will be allowed to bubble up as they come.

The company also said it was testing a ""New Posts"" button so that users can refresh their feeds when they want to, rather than automatically being transported to the top in the middle of browsing.

The changes are in response to user feedback. They appear to address some common gripes, like how certain posts can keep appearing on your screen for days and days and days, or how your feed can begin to feel skewed in favor of the same old friends you habitually double-tap.

""We did this via a number of changes, including an adjustment so that very old content does not get bumped up higher in feed,"" said Gabe Madway, Instagram's spokesman.","The changes appear to address some common gripes, like how some posts can keep appearing on your feed seemingly for days.",693e42da-0096-5458-8999-67aeecb0d1c8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/23/us/23xp-instagram/merlin_135829371_ce92caee-76b8-4b69-87d0-a2514b0606f3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=34f5b06d3f96dcf3aabee51e204902ec96268efc5a031967ca1011a3cf9dc6ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Instagram's feed ranking is ""constantly adapting and improving based on new data,"" a company spokesman said.",693e42da-0096-5458-8999-67aeecb0d1c8,N24News/imgs/693e42da-0096-5458-8999-67aeecb0d1c8.jpg,20

* None  

HARDING TOWNSHIP, N.J. -- Shy recessive types can appreciate art at a safe remove from the action, but collectors usually need to get off the sofa to capture the object of desire. The practice rewards moxie. Sandy and Louis Grotta, who have been collecting almost as long as they have been married -- 64 years -- possess that quality in abundance, having filled their home with some 300 pieces of crafts and jewelry. In the late 1950s, they happened to go to the Museum of Contemporary Crafts after a visit to the Museum of Modern Art, and lightning struck. ""I fell in love with these woodworkers,"" Mrs. Grotta, 85, said of the acclaimed husband-and-wife artisans Edgar and Joyce Anderson. ""I came home and I got rid of all my furniture."" It set Mrs. Grotta on a path as an interior designer, and she and her husband began remaking their life to incorporate works by the Andersons; the ceramist Toshiko Takaezu (a particular favorite represented by blue-inflected pieces in the living room as well as in an upstairs bathroom); the textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen, the jeweler and sculptor Wendy Ramshaw; the textile artist Sheila Hicks; and dozens more. Various ceramic forms, small moonpots and rattles by Toshiko Takaezu, late 1990s. In the late 1980s, they moved into their current home, designed by Richard Meier, a lifelong friend of Mr. Grotta's who created it as a showplace, to their specifications. The aesthetic is one of earthy objects set against the stark white geometry of the architecture. As Mrs. Grotta put it, ""I like texture."" Pieces from the American craft movement dominate, but the collection ranges across the globe, too. Nor has Mr. Grotta, 86, been a slouch in seeking out art. Now retired, when he was working for Paige Electric (eventually becoming its president), he traveled the country for business. ""I'd have lunch or dinner with the customer, and the rest of my time was free,"" he said. ""And so I'd go see the dealers and the craft-makers."" He added that the couple's modus operandi is to follow their instinct and not worry about research: ""We look and say, 'That's the one.'"" A book on their trove, ""The Grotta Home by Richard Meier: A Marriage of Architecture and Craft,"" was recently published, with photographs by their son, Tom, a dealer in fiber arts. The Grottas talked recently about how they accumulated their collection and why. These are edited excerpts from the conversation.

GROTTA That's one of the things that made this work. If we could've bought Picasso, we would've bought that. But it's always been affordable. And don't forget, we thought of collecting as just doing our house. It's home improvement. MRS. GROTTA The first priority was to decorate our kids' bedrooms, because we knew they were going to go on and leave the house, and we wanted them to develop good taste before they left. Seems like it worked. How did you think about arranging it all? MR. GROTTA When the pieces all have the same vocabulary, you can move something from room to room, and as long the scale's right, it'll work. And things tell you if they don't belong. We've given a lot of thought to having a foreground, middle ground and background, too. If we had Mount Fuji outside, then we'd be perfect.

GROTTA Well, a month ago, Eva Eisler [the Czech jewelry designer] walked into the house with a ring ... MRS. GROTTA I said, ""I want that."" And I bought it. MRS. GROTTA If I like something. MR. GROTTA Years ago, Sandy fell down in London and she wound up in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. She was in pain. Wendy [Ramshaw] came to see her in the hospital, and she had this necklace on.

Health,Trump's F.D.A. Nominee Sidesteps Questions About Banning Flavored Vaping Products,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/health/vaping-trump-fda-hahn.html,"President Trump's nominee for Food and Drug Administration commissioner, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, declined to answer questions from senators in both parties about whether he would push for a ban on flavored vaping products at a confirmation hearing Wednesday. The questions placed Dr. Hahn, a cancer executive without any Washington or governing experience, at the center of a political battle over the surge in teen vaping and the emergence of mysterious vaping-related illnesses that have killed at least 44 people and sickened more than 2,000. Most of the lung injuries reported in recent months have been attributed to THC-related products. The Trump administration has recently retreated from a promise in September that it would ban most flavored e-cigarette products, citing concerns about the effects on businesses and repercussions from voters.

Dr. Hahn, who is the chief medical executive of the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, said he had not discussed the issue with Mr. Trump. He added that the decision on flavor restrictions would not come under his purview because it was already under final review by the White House. But he also noted his training as a lung cancer doctor, and said at the hearing, ""I think this is an important, urgent crisis in this country,"" adding that he did not want to see another generation of teenagers become addicted to tobacco and nicotine. ""I believe that we need to take aggressive action to stop that.""

Several states and municipalities have tried to outlaw flavored e-cigarettes and are now facing court challenges from the vaping industry. On Tuesday, the American Medical Association called for a far-reaching ban on all vaping products, as two more states sued Juul, the nation's largest seller of e-cigarettes, over its marketing practices. The questions about e-cigarettes, by members of the Senate's Committee on Health, Education Labor and Pensions, highlighted how carefully Dr. Hahn would need to navigate a range of sensitive issues if he were confirmed to lead the F. D.A., a sprawling agency with oversight of everything from tobacco and e-cigarettes to food safety and the approval of drugs and medical devices. At the hearing, Senator Mitt Romney, Republican of Utah, described the questions about e-cigarettes as a ""canary in the coal mine"" that would demonstrate how Dr. Hahn would respond to political pressure and corporate influence . ""How you will deal with this issue is a pretty good test case for how you will deal with these issues on an ongoing basis,"" he said. Dr. Hahn sought to portray himself as a committed cancer researcher and medical doctor who would bring the values of those professions to his tenure as F.D.A. commissioner. ""Patients need to come first, and the decisions that we make need to be guided by science and data, congruent with the law,"" he said.

If he is confirmed by the Senate, Dr. Hahn would fill the vacancy left by Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who stepped down as commissioner in April . On Tuesday, five former commissioners, including Dr. Gottlieb, endorsed Dr. Hahn. Dr. Hahn's views on how vaping products should be regulated would occur at a critical juncture, as e-cigarette companies begin submitting evidence ahead of a May deadline to show that their products do more good than harm. He will have to balance public outcry over teen vaping use with intense lobbying by e-cigarette manufacturers and vape shops that argue their products provide an alternative to traditional cigarettes and their users make up a potent voting bloc. The federal government has repeatedly weakened or delayed efforts to rein in vaping products over the past decade. In 2016, the Obama administration backtracked on a proposed ban on flavored e-cigarettes, and in 2017, Dr. Gottlieb extended a key deadline for vaping manufacturers to provide evidence about their products' effects on public health. If he is confirmed, Dr. Hahn has said he would divest his interests in dozens of companies that do business with the F.D.A., from Coca-Cola and Starbucks to technology companies, like Alphabet, the parent company of Google, which is developing health care products. He also said he would resign his positions at institutions like M.D. Anderson, the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center and the University of Pennsylvania. He said he also would recuse himself from discussions involving those institutions for a year after his resignations. The committee chairman, Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, said a vote by the committee on Dr. Hahn's nomination is expected in early December.","The nominee, Dr. Stephen M. Hahn, said the decision to restrict flavors would not be his, if confirmed, because it was already under final review by the White House.",73ce006e-d895-51fe-81ef-0af216d2377c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/20/science/20FDA1/20FDA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c7af2b33305e627474d12afad7a92e805daba53e968ca3f27edd84a5e433e11d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Pro-vaping demonstrators outside the White House earlier this month.

Opinion,Trump Kills Iran's Most Overrated Warrior,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/opinion/iran-general-soleimani.html,"One day they may name a street after President Trump in Tehran. Why? Because Trump just ordered the assassination of possibly the dumbest man in Iran and the most overrated strategist in the Middle East: Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. Think of the miscalculations this guy made. In 2015, the United States and the major European powers agreed to lift virtually all their sanctions on Iran, many dating back to 1979, in return for Iran halting its nuclear weapons program for a mere 15 years, but still maintaining the right to have a peaceful nuclear program. It was a great deal for Iran. Its economy grew by over 12 percent the next year. And what did Suleimani do with that windfall? He and Iran's supreme leader launched an aggressive regional imperial project that made Iran and its proxies the de facto controlling power in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sana. This freaked out U.S. allies in the Sunni Arab world and Israel -- and they pressed the Trump administration to respond. Trump himself was eager to tear up any treaty forged by President Obama, so he exited the nuclear deal and imposed oil sanctions on Iran that have now shrunk the Iranian economy by almost 10 percent and sent unemployment over 16 percent. All that for the pleasure of saying that Tehran can call the shots in Beirut, Damascus, Baghdad and Sana. What exactly was second prize?

With the Tehran regime severely deprived of funds, the ayatollahs had to raise gasoline prices at home, triggering massive domestic protests. That required a harsh crackdown by Iran's clerics against their own people that left thousands jailed and killed, further weakening the legitimacy of the regime. Then Mr. ""Military Genius"" Suleimani decided that, having propped up the regime of President Bashar al-Assad in Syria, and helping to kill 500,000 Syrians in the process, he would overreach again and try to put direct pressure on Israel. He would do this by trying to transfer precision-guided rockets from Iran to Iranian proxy forces in Lebanon and Syria. Alas, Suleimani discovered that fighting Israel -- specifically, its combined air force, special forces, intelligence and cyber -- is not like fighting the Nusra front or the Islamic State. The Israelis hit back hard, sending a whole bunch of Iranians home from Syria in caskets and hammering their proxies as far away as Western Iraq. Indeed, Israeli intelligence had so penetrated Suleimani's Quds Force and its proxies that Suleimani would land a plane with precision munitions in Syria at 5 p.m., and the Israeli air force would blow it up by 5:30 p.m. Suleimani's men were like fish in a barrel. If Iran had a free press and a real parliament, he would have been fired for colossal mismanagement. But it gets better, or actually worse, for Suleimani. Many of his obituaries say that he led the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq, in tacit alliance with America. Well, that's true. But what they omit is that Suleimani's, and Iran's, overreaching in Iraq helped to produce the Islamic State in the first place.

It was Suleimani and his Quds Force pals who pushed Iraq's Shiite prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, to push Sunnis out of the Iraqi government and army, stop paying salaries to Sunni soldiers, kill and arrest large numbers of peaceful Sunni protesters and generally turn Iraq into a Shiite-dominated sectarian state. The Islamic State was the counterreaction. Finally, it was Suleimani's project of making Iran the imperial power in the Middle East that turned Iran into the most hated power in the Middle East for many of the young, rising pro-democracy forces -- both Sunnis and Shiites -- in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq. As the Iranian-American scholar Ray Takeyh pointed out in a wise essay in Politico, in recent years ""Soleimani began expanding Iran's imperial frontiers. For the first time in its history, Iran became a true regional power, stretching its influence from the banks of the Mediterranean to the Persian Gulf. Soleimani understood that Persians would not be willing to die in distant battlefields for the sake of Arabs, so he focused on recruiting Arabs and Afghans as an auxiliary force. He often boasted that he could create a militia in little time and deploy it against Iran's various enemies."" It was precisely those Suleimani proxies -- Hezbollah in Lebanon and Syria, the Popular Mobilization Forces in Iraq, and the Houthis in Yemen -- that created pro-Iranian Shiite states-within-states in all of these countries. And it was precisely these states-within-states that helped to prevent any of these countries from cohering, fostered massive corruption and kept these countries from developing infrastructure -- schools, roads, electricity. And therefore it was Suleimani and his proxies -- his ""kingmakers"" in Lebanon, Syria and Iraq -- who increasingly came to be seen, and hated, as imperial powers in the region, even more so than Trump's America. This triggered popular, authentic, bottom-up democracy movements in Lebanon and Iraq that involved Sunnis and Shiites locking arms together to demand noncorrupt, nonsectarian democratic governance. On Nov. 27, Iraqi Shiites -- yes, Iraqi Shiites -- burned down the Iranian consulate in Najaf, Iraq, removing the Iranian flag from the building and putting an Iraqi flag in its place. That was after Iraqi Shiites, in September 2018, set the Iranian consulate in Basra ablaze, shouting condemnations of Iran's interference in Iraqi politics. The whole ""protest"" against the United States Embassy compound in Baghdad last week was almost certainly a Suleimani-staged operation to make it look as if Iraqis wanted America out when in fact it was the other way around. The protesters were paid pro-Iranian militiamen. No one in Baghdad was fooled by this.

In a way, it's what got Suleimani killed. He so wanted to cover his failures in Iraq he decided to start provoking the Americans there by shelling their forces, hoping they would overreact, kill Iraqis and turn them against the United States. Trump, rather than taking the bait, killed Suleimani instead. I have no idea whether this was wise or what will be the long-term implications. But here are two things I do know about the Middle East. First, often in the Middle East the opposite of ""bad"" is not ""good."" The opposite of bad often turns out to be ""disorder."" Just because you take out a really bad actor like Suleimani doesn't mean a good actor, or a good change in policy, comes in his wake. Suleimani is part of a system called the Islamic Revolution in Iran. That revolution has managed to use oil money and violence to stay in power since 1979 -- and that is Iran's tragedy, a tragedy that the death of one Iranian general will not change. Today's Iran is the heir to a great civilization and the home of an enormously talented people and significant culture. Wherever Iranians go in the world today, they thrive as scientists, doctors, artists, writers and filmmakers -- except in the Islamic Republic of Iran, whose most famous exports are suicide bombing, cyberterrorism and proxy militia leaders. The very fact that Suleimani was probably the most famous Iranian in the region speaks to the utter emptiness of this regime, and how it has wasted the lives of two generations of Iranians by looking for dignity in all the wrong places and in all the wrong ways. The other thing I know is that in the Middle East all important politics happens the morning after the morning after. Yes, in the coming days there will be noisy protests in Iran, the burning of American flags and much crying for the ""martyr."" The morning after the morning after? There will be a thousand quiet conversations inside Iran that won't get reported. They will be about the travesty that is their own government and how it has squandered so much of Iran's wealth and talent on an imperial project that has made Iran hated in the Middle East. And yes, the morning after, America's Sunni Arab allies will quietly celebrate Suleimani's death, but we must never forget that it is the dysfunction of many of the Sunni Arab regimes -- their lack of freedom, modern education and women's empowerment -- that made them so weak that Iran was able to take them over from the inside with its proxies.","Suleimani pushed his country to build an empire, but drove it into the ground instead.",118137eb-e5bd-5c94-81c3-62216c106962,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/03/opinion/03friedman/03friedman-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=cbdf90f9f176423656280ec24e63859e38e22d2a6385c99ad1568583889c25b4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A portrait of Maj.

Food,What to Cook This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/03/dining/what-to-cook-this-weekend.html,"Good morning. There's a little convenience store attached to the gas station down the street from where I stay and, if you get there early enough, just after the sun makes its appearance in the eastern sky, it's possible to obtain one of the six or seven egg sandwiches the cashier makes every morning before unlocking the door. They sit on a shelf by the register, in front of a new plexiglass shield, hot in their foil jackets, soft and salty within, a $4 treat on a day that won't yield many of them.

I think of these sandwiches in the way people used to think of off-menu secret burgers or fried chicken sandwiches or bowls of pho at luxe restaurants in Manhattan, available only at certain times, in extremely limited numbers, for those in the know. The cashier does good work on the electric griddle in the back of the store. There's a thrill to securing one of her sandwiches, which tastes all the more delicious for the difficulty in obtaining it.

Lately, I've been making them at home, myself, a no-recipe breakfast recipe worth trying out: warmed but untoasted Kaiser rolls spread with salted butter, with an egg over easy, a few slices of cheese, a spray of black pepper and a dab of ketchup. I wrap the sandwich in foil while I'm making tea and reading the front page of the newspaper. By the time I'm ready to turn to the jumps of the stories, the thing has come together into a steaming warm whole, a perfect sandwich for one of those days you want to start with a savory balm.

On other days, though, and perhaps especially on the weekend, what I crave is sweet. Dorie Greenspan has a fantastic new recipe right in that lane, for a big, flaky blueberry scone she learned from the restaurateur Joanne Chang, to delight the senses and concentrate the mind.",Brighten your weekend morning with Joanne Chang's blueberry scones.,5f068c6d-cbc5-51d4-99fd-8fa7f6d9d79c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/24/dining/24BERRYBUCKLE/24BERRYBUCKLE-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3040cdbe6c7a6bb5b8e211b83e05198a610a4df1aee7c0f1ad1b6046eb349fcb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Summer berry buckle.,5f068c6d-cbc5-51d4-99fd-8fa7f6d9d79c,N24News/imgs/5f068c6d-cbc5-51d4-99fd-8fa7f6d9d79c.jpg,17
Dance,Down the Rabbit Hole With an Off-Kilter Thom Yorke,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/17/arts/dance/thom-yorke-anima-dance.html,"""Anima,"" the new solo album by Thom Yorke of Radiohead, has artistic tentacles. Its arrival coincides with a short film and within that, a dance -- elusive, dreamlike and worthy of its leading man: a singer who knows how to move. The film's choreography, set to three songs from ""Anima,"" begins normally enough as subway commuters collectively begin to nod off. Hands catch drooping heads in last-minute saves. Soon enough, their bodies form a collective as they execute an eerie, eccentric pattern of gestures, transforming them from humans into corporeal machinery. Later, references flash by: to Buster Keaton, Mary Poppins, the film ""Metropolis."" Yet this Netflix production is a love story with Mr. Yorke, its lithe oddball hero, in pursuit of a soulful, dark-haired woman he spotted on the train. (She is Dajana Roncione, an Italian actress and Mr. Yorke's real-life partner.) When the commuters exit, she follows suit, leaving her lunchbox behind. With the off-kilter grace of Keaton, Mr. Yorke is on a mission: to retrieve the object, which hints at Mary Poppins's carpetbag as well as her strange world of enchantment, and find her. ""It's this idea of Alice following the rabbit,"" said Damien Jalet, the film's choreographer. ""Or finding the loved one in this labyrinth.""

""Anima"" is directed by Paul Thomas Anderson, but there is another, more understated, collaboration at work here: the one between choreographer and dancer. Mr. Yorke, who has long demonstrated an intuitive feel for movement, met Mr. Jalet, on the dance-heavy horror film ""Suspiria."" (Mr. Yorke composed the score, Mr. Jalet was its choreographer.) Mr. Jalet said Mr. Yorke contacted him in December about taking part in a project that would be something more than a standard music video. ""I know that Thom loves dance as a language,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""I think we were looking for something that would be a bit awkward -- in French, we say decale, which is a bit off track.""

The result is a dystopian fairy tale, culminating in a pas de deux to the song ""Dawn Chorus,"" in which the faces and hands of Mr. Yorke and Ms. Roncione are distilled into a dreamy kaleidoscope. It's a glimpse into a private world of reverie until, in the space of little more than a breath, Mr. York is left alone in the frame. Was it all a dream? Mr. Yorke has worked with the dance world before. With Radiohead, he composed half of the score for Merce Cunningham's ""Split Sides"" (2003). (Sigur Ros created the other half.) And, memorably, in the 2011 video for the Radiohead song ""Lotus Flower"" he performed a solo choreographed by the British choreographer Wayne McGregor.

That black-and-white video shows Mr. Yorke, gangly and loose, twitching his body to and against the beat as jittery shapes overtake his body. He has the predatory grace of a serpent. But ""Anima,"" which Mr. Jalet said was Mr. Yorke's most extensive experience with dance, was a stretch. ""He had to work with a partner,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""And he had to fit within a group of people. It's more than promoting the album -- it's something that will have a life of its own."" One group scene element was inspired by ""Skid,"" a previous work by Mr. Jalet in which he explored gravity with a tilted platform. ""That was the thing I was the most nervous of because it's a lot of counting and it's quick,"" he said. ""To get used to the slope can be intimidating."" But Mr. Yorke was more than game. ""It was incredible to see Thom learning all of this in two hours and just nailing it,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""And not only that, but being funny and awkward.""

Throughout the film, Mr. Jalet experiments with gravity and shifting perspectives. The opening train scene, set to ""Not the News,"" was inspired his memories of visiting Japan. ""The metro is safe there, and people are pretty overworked so when they go back home, there is this moment when they start falling asleep,"" he said. ""In Japan, nobody touches each other and then suddenly you start seeing people tilting. I've always felt it was such a beautiful physical manifestation of the unconscious."" Such disconnection between the body and the head is somehow the key ingredient of ""Anima,"" the dance -- letting go of the mind in order to succumb to a dream. The choreography's final moments are ambiguous and surreal: Ms. Roncione and Mr. Yorke press foreheads. Slowly their hands drift apart. And it ends as it began: with Mr. Yorke nodding off. ""It's like it's a cycle,"" Mr. Jalet said. ""It could all start back again from the moment he finds himself at the beginning in the train.""","The dance in the short film for ""Anima"" is worthy of a singer who has long demonstrated an intuitive feel for movement.",2ad67457-f274-55a2-a24c-9c175d3d964a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/17/arts/17anima-video/17anima-video-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=7c1a3850409ffab06cd0efb9f0892cf420de0e58ed105c27e2b8d24e49db51f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""Anima.""",2ad67457-f274-55a2-a24c-9c175d3d964a,N24News/imgs/2ad67457-f274-55a2-a24c-9c175d3d964a.jpg,6
Science,"Poachers Are Invading Botswana, Last Refuge of African Elephants",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/01/science/elephants-poaching-botswana.html,"A dead elephant inspected by a soldier in Chobe, northern Botswana, in September. Poachers, mostly from Zambia, now are operating in Botswana, conservationists report.





The news had international repercussions. Botswana had been one of the last great elephant refuges, largely spared the poaching crisis that has swept through much of Africa over the past decade. The country is home to some 126,000 savanna elephants, about a third of Africa's remaining population -- plentiful enough that they are increasingly in conflict with villagers in the northern part of the country.

Following the announcement in September, Botswana's ministry of the environment denied that there was a poaching crisis of any sort, and in May the government lifted a ban on trophy hunting that had been in place for five years, provoking worldwide condemnation. Even some scientists wondered whether the illegal ivory trade really had found its way to Botswana. Now, the researchers have published data in the journal Current Biology that seems to confirm their initial findings. Based on aerial surveys and field visits, the authors report that fresh elephant carcasses in Botswana increased by nearly 600 percent from 2014 to 2018. Samuel Wasser, a conservation biologist at the University of Washington in Seattle who was not involved in the research, said that ""there's no question"" about the authors' findings. ""The work was exceptional in every way,"" he said. ""There were so many features they carefully and meticulously documented. And they also looked at alternative hypotheses, and none were supported by data.""

Such careful documentation of poaching is sorely needed across Africa, Dr. Wasser added: ""This is an example of how to do it right, and hopefully others will learn from it."" Reached by phone, Cyril Taolo, director of research at Botswana's Department of Wildlife and National Parks, said that he and his colleagues ""are still interrogating this paper and coming up with a response"" to the concerns raised by the conservationists. The survey was led by Michael Chase, founder and director of Elephants Without Borders, a nonprofit conservation organization based in Kasane, Botswana. Squeezed into a fixed-wing Cessna, Dr. Chase and his colleagues crisscrossed 36,300 square miles of habitat, counting and photographing all living and dead elephants they spotted 300 feet below. They recorded 156 carcasses they believed to be poached, clustered at five hot spots. One criticism of the earlier report had been that an elephant's cause of death is impossible to determine from the air. Scott Schlossberg, a data analyst at Elephants Without Borders and co-author of paper, disagreed: ""When an elephant's face has been chopped off, you can often see that from the plane."" But to assuage such concerns, he and his colleagues used a helicopter to make field visits to 148 carcasses. About half were fresh, the rest at least a year old.

The findings revealed a 593 percent increase in the number of freshly killed carcasses, compared to survey results from 2014. Extrapolating the numbers, the researchers estimated that a minimum of 385 elephants had been poached in Botswana between 2017 and 2018. ""Those scientists and colleagues who cast doubt on our initial findings I hope now find that the science and evidence that we describe in our paper is indeed convincing,"" Dr. Chase said. The results of this ""state of the art"" study speak for themselves, putting to rest any doubt that Botswana has a poaching problem, said Keith Lindsay, a collaborating researcher at the Amboseli Trust for Elephants, a nonprofit research group in Kenya, who was not involved in the study. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] ""The few people who did speak against Mike's original results were researchers who have a history working in Botswana and who want to be seen as supporting the government,"" Dr. Lindsay said. ""My own interpretation is that they wanted to support their future position in Botswana."" While 400 elephants killed out of a population of 126,000 does not sound like a lot, the study authors warn that the situation could quickly escalate. Small increases in poaching -- similar to the rates now being seen in Botswana -- have preceded dramatic elephant declines in other places.","New data leave little doubt that the illegal ivory trade has reached the country, scientists say.",4534f3de-e914-5534-8b8d-46acd949fd8d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/01/science/01SCI-BOTSWANAELEPHANTS3/01SCI-BOTSWANAELEPHANTS3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=47b6bdf63032d678ecf3d214b481ff82ebb141dd74410313f96ac84c58fd6199&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Elephants in Chobe National Park in northern Botswana.,4534f3de-e914-5534-8b8d-46acd949fd8d,N24News/imgs/4534f3de-e914-5534-8b8d-46acd949fd8d.jpg,2
Health,'The Drug Became His Friend': Pandemic Drives Hike in Opioid Deaths,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/29/health/coronavirus-opioids-addiction.html,"BARRE, Vermont -- On the first Friday in June, Jefrey Cameron, 29, left his home around midnight to buy heroin. He had been struggling with addiction for seven years but had seemingly turned a corner, holding down a job that he loved at Basil's Pizzeria, driving his teenage sister to the mall to go shopping and sharing a home with his grandmother. But then the coronavirus pandemic hit. When he returned home that night and tried the product, it was so potent that he fell and hit his head in the bathroom. Mr. Cameron texted a friend soon after, saying that he had messed up and would go to a 12-step meeting with a friend that weekend. ""I promise I'm good and I can't get in any more trouble tonight,"" he wrote. ""Sweet dreams, if you wake up before you hear from me definitely call me. The sooner I get up and into town the better."" When Mr. Cameron woke up, he used the rest of the powder -- largely fentanyl, not heroin, his family would later learn -- from a small bag with a bunny stamped on it. Less than five hours after he sent the text, his grandmother found him dead. In the six months since Covid-19 brought the nation to a standstill, the opioid epidemic has taken a sharp turn for the worse. More than 40 states have recorded increases in opioid-related deaths since the pandemic began, according to the American Medical Association. In Arkansas, the use of Narcan, an overdose-reversing drug, has tripled. Jacksonville, Fla., has seen a 40 percent increase in overdose-related calls. In March alone, York County in Pennsylvania recorded three times more overdose deaths than normal.

When Vermont shut down in March, so did Mr. Cameron's job, which provided his biggest support network. He was lonely and had money to spare: the $600 per week he received in extra unemployment benefits from the federal government was more than he earned from his job. ""Jefrey hated being alone. And the last couple of weeks, he was,"" said Ms. Reil, who is 47. His grandmother had gone to Atlanta to visit her other children and had delayed flying home for fear of catching Covid-19. In her absence, Mr. Cameron started keeping the television tuned to her favorite channel, blaring Western movies and ""Bonanza"" reruns. ""He was home alone a lot more,"" Ms. Reil said. ""And I think the drug became his friend."" Mr. Cameron had stopped taking Suboxone, a medication that helps suppress the cravings and withdrawal symptoms that plague people addicted to opioids, last fall; it has been found to sharply reduce the risk of dying from an overdose, but he had grown tired of taking it after three years, his mother said.

Opioid addiction has been a scourge in Vermont for more than two decades. When dealers and illegal drug organizations realized they could charge more for narcotics here than they could in nearby cities such as Boston, New York or Montreal, the market was flooded. As the painkillers that many young Vermonters became addicted to in the early 2000s grew harder to get starting about a decade ago, heroin moved in. Then came fentanyl, which is far more potent and has driven up deaths in almost every corner of the country. Last year, after aggressive efforts to expand access to treatment, Vermont saw its first decrease in opioid-related deaths since 2014; that year, then-Gov. Peter Shumlin devoted his entire State of the State Message to what he called ""a full-blown heroin crisis"" gripping Vermont. But Vermont saw 82 opioid overdoses through July of this year, up from 60 during the same period last year.

But in order to be admitted, patients have to test negative for Covid-19 -- a potentially deadly setback for some who are unable or unwilling to wait several days for results. Far more common than inpatient addiction care is treatment with three medications that help suppress the cravings and withdrawal symptoms that plague people addicted to opioids. Vermont has gone further than most states in expanding access to medication-assisted treatment, as it is known; at least 8,960 residents -- about 1.5 percent of the state's population -- were taking one of the three medications, buprenorphine, methadone and naltrexone, during the first quarter of this year. Once the pandemic began, the federal government tried to make it easier for patients to stay on these medications while doctors' offices and clinics were generally closed and people were being asked to stay home. Nik Rowley, 37, has been taking a daily dose of Suboxone -- a brand name for buprenorphine -- for about eight years.

Mr. Rowley was getting back on his feet after being hospitalized for pneumonia when the pandemic hit. With nowhere else to go, he found housing in a hotel through a state-funded program to keep residents off the streets. The extra supply of medication helped him avoid drugs, but in his hotel room, he relapsed on alcohol. ""I had a few beers at the hotel because you're stuck in a room all by yourself,"" he said. ""You have nothing to do. So all you do is sit there and ruminate and your depression gets worse."" Brattleboro has several hotels that the state helped convert into temporary housing units for homeless and other at-risk people. Groundworks, a year-round housing service in Windham County, typically places 33 people in hotels during the winter months; in the spring, the number swelled to 150. Many of the recent lethal overdoses in the town have taken place at those hotels. ""We immediately saw a skyrocket in the amount of substances that people were using,"" says Rhianna Kendrick, director of operations for Groundworks.

When he got housed at a hotel in late March he was using less than a bag of heroin a day, but his use has gone up. Despite efforts to stop -- he briefly tried medication-assisted treatment -- he accidentally overdosed twice in July. ""I am not honoring some of the parts of myself that have so much potential,"" Mr. Luoma wrote in a text message that month. Understand the Opioid Crisis During the Pandemic The first months. As Covid-19 brought the U.S. to a standstill, the opioid epidemic took a sharp turn for the worse. More than 40 states recorded increases in opioid-related deaths in the first six months of the pandemic. A reversal of progress. Despite modest gains against addiction -- including a slight dip in deaths in 2018 -- fatal overdoses were rising even before Covid arrived. But the pandemic unquestionably exacerbated the trend. An unprecedented spike. U.S. overdose deaths rose nearly 30 percent in 2020 to 93,000, then the largest single-year increase recorded. Deaths peaked nationally in the spring amid the most severe period of shutdowns. Fueled by fentanyl. The rise in deaths was fueled by increased use of fentanyl, a cheap and readily available drug that is 100 times as powerful as morphine. It is often added surreptitiously as a substitute to other drugs. A grim threshold. Overdose deaths in the U.S. exceeded 100,000 for the first time in the yearlong period ending in April 2021. The figure is more than the death toll of car accidents and guns combined. ""Last night I almost died again,"" he wrote. ""I may have to wait 2-3 weeks to get into rehab. I'm fortunate to have the folks from Groundworks willing to find ways to help me through this waiting period, but the nagging urge, the beast inside that sits waiting for a moment of weakness could kill me before I am able to get in."" Not all drug-related deaths during the pandemic have been from overdoses. Jessie-Mae DeCosta, 32, died from sepsis, an infection she got from injecting drugs. ""Covid kind of sealed Jessie's fate,"" said her mother, LaNell DeCosta, 62, of Bristol, Vt.

The Reil family decided to wait over a month after Mr. Cameron died to hold a service. On a bright and humid afternoon in July, more than 80 friends and family members came together at St. Sylvester's Catholic Cemetery in Barre to mourn him. ""Our hearts break, our heads shake at the injustice of yet another young life extinguished by the disease of addiction,"" Pastor Rachel Fraumann said after beginning her service with a strong warning for mourners to stay as distant from one another as possible. ""I don't want to do a bunch of funerals on the heels of this one."" Tara Reil and her four surviving children sat in white folding chairs with masks, tissues and water bottles handy. Two of Mr. Cameron's brothers had flown in from out of state, taking leave from their posts in the Marine Corps and Navy. Six family members spoke, including Mr. Cameron's stepfather, Terry Reil. ""Let Jef's purpose empower you to make a difference in yours or someone else's life,"" he said, ""to do good things in this world or just let someone you know, know you care about them.""","In the months since the pandemic took hold in the U.S., the opioid epidemic has taken a sharp turn for the worse.

Science,"Under Pressure, F.D.A. Adds Measures on Opioid Abuse",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/05/health/under-pressure-fda-adds-measures-on-opioid-abuse.html,"Under pressure from Congress to take action amid a worsening opioid epidemic, the Food and Drug Administration on Thursday announced several measures aimed at dealing with abuse.

Dr. Robert Califf, the acting commissioner and nominee to run the agency, announced the measures in a phone conference with reporters. He said the steps were an attempt by the agency to toughen its response to the crisis, in which tens of thousands of Americans were addicted to the prescription painkillers and were dying of overdoses. He said the actions were part of a broader government effort: Earlier this week, the Obama administration said it would ask Congress to spend an additional $1.1 billion next year on the problem, which would help increase badly needed treatment facilities.

""It has reached a point where we felt we had to step back and take a careful look at everything and see what we could do,"" Dr. Califf said. ""We thought we could do more.""

The decrees include convening an expert panel before approving some new opioids, strengthening requirements to study a drug after it has come to market, and increasing access to training on pain management for doctors and other prescribers.","Dr. Robert Califf, the acting commissioner, acknowledged the broader concern from Congress as the agency had come under fire for continuing to approve opioids.",2aff9a24-24c9-5562-9899-8f75556e51e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/05/us/05fda/05fda-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=3e4997f2a5aea764cbec51b7cd4bb1ea38e1b22dcab9eaa3e4ec93fa8f7e0192&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Robert Califf, the acting commissioner and nominee to lead the F.D.A., announced new measures aimed at reducing opioid abuse.",2aff9a24-24c9-5562-9899-8f75556e51e1,N24News/imgs/2aff9a24-24c9-5562-9899-8f75556e51e1.jpg,2

The Churchills, Roosevelts, and Harrimans: A Story of Family, Love, and War 

By Catherine Grace Katz In the opening weeks of 1945, with their armies racing to Berlin, the three Allied leaders recognized that the war had reached a critical juncture and called for another strategy session to resolve difficult questions about the defeat of Germany and the future organization of Europe. Weary and coping increasingly with the frailties of age, Britain's prime minister, Winston Churchill, dreaded the prospect of traveling all the way to the Crimea, as far west as Stalin was willing to go. He harbored grave concerns about holding the meeting on the Black Sea coast, and complained that if the planners had been given 10 years to research a possible rendezvous site, they could not have found a more inconvenient venue. But eager to secure Soviet cooperation to guarantee victory in the Pacific, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, despite his own deteriorating health, accepted Stalin's proposal for a summit in Yalta. Churchill, who had suffered a serious bout of pneumonia on the way home from the last meeting of the ""Big Three,"" in Tehran, grudgingly agreed to make the arduous journey, but warned his daughter, Sarah, that this time he knew he was ""in for something."" According to ""The Daughters of Yalta,"" Catherine Grace Katz's detailed behind-the-scenes account of the conference, Churchill's trip did not get off to a promising start. Between the blizzard that chased them east and his percolating anxiety, by the time Churchill arrived at Malta on Jan. 30 for a preliminary huddle with Roosevelt, he was feverish and filled with trepidation about the upcoming negotiations. He was also sweating the state of the British-American friendship, which was not as close as it had been in the early days of the war. It was essential that he find a way to settle Britain's differences with America, or it would portend badly for postwar cooperation. As he paced and fretted, it fell to 30-year-old Sarah, a former actress who had enlisted in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force, to take on the delicate role of supporting Winston that her mother, Clementine, had gratefully ceded. Sarah could manage her mercurial father, ease his worries and temper the linguistic torrents when he vented his spleen. Eager to redeem herself in his eyes now that she had forsaken her stage career and her much older husband, from both of which Churchill had tried to dissuade her, she wanted nothing more than to be allowed to serve as his chosen ""second mate.""

Roosevelt, filled with his own misgivings about the 6,000-mile trek, decided to ask his timid 38-year-old daughter, Anna, a mother of three, to be his aide-de-camp at Yalta. Suffering from congestive heart failure, the president struggled to conceal his weakened condition, though his pallor and hollow cheeks were obviously those of a very sick man. Anna, who had long wished to be closer to her father, had begged to accompany him in the past, but he had always spurned her in favor of one of his sons. Desperate for affirmation, she seized the opportunity to be by his side at the conference, sensing it might be her last chance to prove her worth to him. In 1944, after her husband joined the Army, she had moved back to the White House and quickly ingratiated herself, frequently standing in as surrogate first lady when her mother, Eleanor, was away, and eventually displacing his special adviser Harry Hopkins, who was battling cancer, as the president's closest confidante and fiercest protector. Roosevelt, Katz writes, had his own rationale for preferring his quiet daughter to his wife or usual advisers: ""F.D.R. was able to thoroughly relax in Anna's presence because he felt that, as a woman, she had 'no ax to grind.' ... She existed to serve her family, especially the men, and to keep them tranquil and content."" Katz spares little sympathy for Eleanor, who reportedly had never been a nurturing person, and for all her good intentions did not help alleviate his stress. ""Could he be blamed for trying to ensure that a grueling trip be as peaceful as possible?""

""The Daughters of Yalta"" is Katz's first book, and she skillfully marshals diaries, letters, oral histories and memoirs to support her thesis that the pressures of wartime had warped normal familial bonds, so that the Western leaders' relationships with their daughters had become more like those between business partners than between parent and child. Loyalty and discretion were prized above all. The busy American ambassador to the Soviet Union, W. Averell Harriman, happily deputized his 27-year-old daughter, Kathleen, to serve as his hostess and chief protocol officer, relying on her to supervise the final arrangements before the battalion-size American delegation arrived at Yalta, and to engage in a little ""soft diplomacy"" on his behalf. (His second wife, Marie, pleaded poor eyesight and remained ensconced at home in New York.) As the younger daughter of the fourth richest man in America, Kathy was accustomed to taking charge -- from an early age she had helped manage her father's Sun Valley resort -- but nothing could have prepared her for the task of turning the ransacked 116-room Livadia Palace, the former summer home of the dead czar, into a suitable headquarters for the handicapped president and his entourage. The glamour of the imperial setting belied the mundane job of coping with the myriad housekeeping and hospitality problems, from an acute shortage of bathrooms and infestation of lice and bedbugs to something as trivial as a mistyped place card, which could offend a delegate's ego and have unforeseen consequences. In Katz's telling, these are daughters Lear would envy -- their devotion to their fathers seemingly knew no end. When assigned to the Soviet Embassy in the autumn of 1943, Harriman wrote to Kathy from Washington and asked her to break off his affair with Churchill's insatiable daughter-in-law, Pamela, who was all of 21 and unhappily married to his alcoholic son, Randolph. ""Help Pam straighten herself out -- poor child,"" he instructed, then advised her to burn the note or lock it away. No fool, Kathy did as she was told and kept her mouth shut. There was, Katz says, an element of self-interest. ""She looked at the situation with pragmatic, transactional detachment -- an ability she no doubt inherited from Averell."" If she did not keep his secret, she risked being sent home. Covering for her father's affair was a convenient way to earn his trust, and a ticket to Moscow.

Roosevelt similarly enlisted his daughter to help hide renewed visits from his former mistress, Lucy Mercer, despite knowing how much this betrayal would wound her mother. Anna placated her ailing father, and shared the burden of guilt. ""As the vault for his secrets,"" Katz writes, ""Anna had made herself indispensable."" Light on political drama, this entertaining history is nevertheless packed with vivid personalities, jockeying aides and insider observations about a pivotal moment in history. Barred from the plenary sessions and meetings, the ""Little Three,"" as Sarah, Anna and Kathy were dubbed, had access only to ""droppings,"" and had to glean the progress of the talks from the faces of the dignitaries as they emerged for dinner. Midway through the conference, the pickings begin to seem increasingly lean, much to the frustration of the women -- and the reader. More important, all three daughters, distracted by sightseeing excursions, underestimated Roosevelt's reserves of strength and gamesmanship in the high-stakes negotiations. He effectively played up to Stalin by distancing himself from Churchill and concealed the atom bomb from the Soviets, all the while trying to win their participation in a new global security organization that he believed was vital to preserving long-term peace. When the Soviet dictator raised his glass to the ladies who graced the final gathering, it struck me as an empty gesture. By the time the last banquet table was cleared, I could not help wondering what three such intelligent, enterprising young women might have achieved had they been allowed to do more than babysit for their famous fathers.","""The Daughters of Yalta,"" by Catherine Grace Katz, recounts the events of the 1945 conference from the perspective of three daughters of Allied leaders who proved themselves indispensable.",0743b9c3-23e6-5a1c-beb3-7ad9a9546919,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/books/review/06Conant/29Conant-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=6bee29536cbfff466e575ff6a1240dae0aa06d07a70411f3960195dfef38b469&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Franklin D.

Technology,Can You Run Android on an iPad?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/technology/personaltech/can-you-run-android-on-an-ipad.html,"Q. I prefer Android and PC applications, but want to run Android on an iPad. I have a Kindle Fire, but I want the true Android environment, and the 10-inch Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 model is too expensive. However, I keep seeing reports that Google Drive, Photos, Docs and other Android apps work fine on iPads. Is that true? Or would I just be miserable?

A. By default, iPads run Apple's iOS operating system, which is a different software platform from Google's own Android operating system, and apps specifically written to run in Android do not work on iOS. Tech enthusiasts have experimented with ways to erase the iOS system from Apple's hardware and manually install a version of Android themselves (and shared the knowledge around the web), but some methods can be tricky and risk damaging your device and voiding your warranty.","If you like Android software and Apple hardware, you can usually find iPad versions of all your favorite Google apps to install.",282dd562-dab6-5860-923c-55b82a8f1005,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/28/technology/personaltech/28techtipwebART/28techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=524&w=1001&s=5e4048fea0bf7e2527cff00c21813c058dac9e9c8819be5ada8d0f64de562258&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"If you can't afford the high-end Android tablet you want, you can get a cheaper one or run many of Google's mobile apps on an iPad after you download them from Apple's App Store.",282dd562-dab6-5860-923c-55b82a8f1005,N24News/imgs/282dd562-dab6-5860-923c-55b82a8f1005.jpg,20
Art & Design,Forest in a Soccer Stadium Outrages Austria's Far Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/24/arts/design/forest-stadium-austria-klagenfurt.html,"""For Forest,"" an installation of 299 trees in the Worthersee stadium in Klagenfurt, Austria.





The curator Klaus Littmann expected complaints when he installed 299 trees -- some up to 50 feet tall -- in a soccer stadium in Austria . In a telephone interview, Mr. Littmann said he wanted people who saw the forest to think about humanity's impact on the environment in places like the Amazon. One day, he added, seeing trees could be a rare spectacle, like going to a soccer match or looking at animals in a zoo.

""But I didn't think this would happen,"" Mr. Littman said about what came next. ""People are using it for political warfare."" Mr. Littmann's project, ""For Forest,"" opened in Klagenfurt, a small city in the southern state of Carinthia, on Sept. 8, as Austria was gearing up for national elections, scheduled for this Sunday. Now, the forest in a stadium has become the surprising focus for a political flap in an area that was once a stronghold of the far-right Freedom Party. Opponents say ""For Forest"" wastes taxpayers' money. ( Mr. Littmann said it has been privately financed, but the regional government said state-funded institutions had spent part of their budgets on related events.) It's also been attacked for using foreign trees, instead of local ones from Carinthia, and for preventing a local soccer team using the stadium for important matches. Mr. Littmann said he had been sworn at in public meetings, and was once pushed in the street and told to go home to Switzerland, where he lives.

But the main public opposition to the project has come from the larger Freedom Party, which has a strong base in Carinthia, and whose former leader Jorg Haider was once the state's governor. Mr. Haider, who died in a car accident in 2008, was a flamboyant and media-savvy leader who brought anti-immigrant and anti-European Union views into the mainstream in Austria. The stakes are high for the Freedom Party in Sunday's election. Support in Carinthia, its former bastion, has slumped; in regional elections in 2018, it secured less than a quarter of the vote. Austria's last coalition government was brought down in May after a video emerged showing Heinz-Christian Strache, the party's current leader and the country's vice chancellor at the time, promising government contracts in exchange for financial support from a woman he thought was a wealthy Russian. Peter Kaiser, Carinthia's current governor and a member of the center-left Social Democratic Party, said in a telephone interview that he did not think the attacks on the project had been successful. ""Day by day, we've seen between 3,000 and 7,000 spectators,"" at the stadium, he said. The protesters, he added, were ""just attacking it and hoping people who have an opposition to the climate situation, have an opposition to green policy, have an opposition to art, vote for them."" Gernot Darmann, the Freedom Party's chairman in Carinthia, denied the party opposed the installation because of its environmental message. In fact, he said in an email, ""The project leaves a devastating ecological footprint,"" because the trees were imported.

""Such a project would have more meaning in large industrial cities with bad air, and in countries where the forest is being over-exploited or destroyed,"" he said. More than 60 percent of land in Carinthia is covered by woods, according to Austria's Federal Office for Forests . Mr. Littmann said transporting the trees had released up to 55 tonnes of carbon dioxide . That is roughly equivalent to the emissions a passenger would create by taking 25 return flights from New York to Vienna. The idea for the project went back about 30 years, Mr. Littmann said, to when he saw a drawing by Max Peintner, an Austrian artist, called ""The Unending Attraction of Nature."" It shows a dense forest in the middle of a sports stadium, with spectators gawping at it from bleachers. ""I was completely fascinated by the image,"" Mr. Littmann said. The curator tried to turn the drawing into reality first in Switzerland, France and Germany, he said, but none of the soccer teams he approached would let their stadiums be used. He succeeded in Klagenfurt because the soccer team there was ""so bad"" at the time that it could not fill the stadium's 30,000 seats, he added, so local authorities were happy to let him use it.

The furor around ""For Forest"" is likely to die away as soon as the election is held, Mr. Littmann said. But views on its success as an artwork will likely linger longer. Almuth Spiegler, the art critic for the Austrian daily Die Presse, said in a telephone interview that she loved Peintner's original drawing: The trees in it had a threatening air to them, she said, and reminded her of a wild animal, caged. But, she said, the installation did not have the same impact. ""It's quite a banal metaphor for climate change ,"" she said, though she added that she kept thinking about it for hours after she saw it, and that it made her look afresh at other trees. Mr. Darmann of the Freedom Party said he did not think the debate would have much impact on the election. He had not actually visited ""For Forest,"" he said, and would not let his son visit either. Instead, he had an alternative idea for an outing, he added: ""In the near future I will take my son for a walk in a beautiful broad-leafed forest in Carinthia.""",An art installation meant to make people think about the environment has become a political target as elections approach.,6f6a62be-da6d-54c4-bc51-91ce0f1e2549,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/24/arts/24austria-forest1/24austria-forest1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=7abc4321627a35da1310cc210af0684c2703e53cd73e7cf50c03bce676b3f317&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""For Forest,"" an installation of 299 trees in the Wörthersee stadium in Klagenfurt, Austria.",6f6a62be-da6d-54c4-bc51-91ce0f1e2549,N24News/imgs/6f6a62be-da6d-54c4-bc51-91ce0f1e2549.jpg,14
Technology,Trump Tried to Protect Qualcomm. Now His Trade War May Be Hurting It.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/technology/qualcomm-nxp-trade-war.html,"Trump Tried to Protect Qualcomm. Now His Trade War May Be Hurting It.

SAN DIEGO -- Steve Mollenkopf, the chief executive of Qualcomm, has been waiting for a phone call with news from China. It has been a long wait. His company, which makes chips that help mobile phones communicate, has been on extended hold while the Chinese authorities review a deal that Qualcomm struck 20 months ago to buy another chip maker, NXP Semiconductors. Mr. Mollenkopf said Qualcomm had done all it could to persuade Beijing to approve the $44 billion transaction, which the companies have said will be terminated next Wednesday without regulatory consent. But both the acquisition and Qualcomm have now become entangled in the trade war raging between the United States and China. China's prolonged review of the deal for NXP is widely seen by analysts and trade experts as part of Beijing's retaliation for President Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods. ""We want to see it get done,"" Mr. Mollenkopf, 49, said in an interview at Qualcomm's headquarters in San Diego. When asked if his company was caught in the trade war, he said, ""That's probably accurate.""

The situation, which may be a sign of what is to come for other multinationals that also have interests dependent on China, is laced with irony. In March, Mr. Trump moved to protect Qualcomm when his administration blocked a $117 billion hostile takeover bid for the company by another chip maker, Broadcom. At the time, Mr. Trump said the deal would ""impair the national security of the United States"" after a government committee found that Broadcom would most likely reduce vital Qualcomm wireless research to the benefit of Chinese companies. Now Mr. Trump may end up hurting the company that he sought to shield, in an unintended consequence of the mounting trade hostilities that his administration has spearheaded. Mr. Mollenkopf and others have said buying NXP, a Dutch chip maker, is important to helping Qualcomm move more quickly into technology for cars and other new markets. A White House spokeswoman did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Mollenkopf appeared resigned to Qualcomm's lack of options with China's review. ""We can only influence so much,"" he said. But the chief executive, a company veteran who took the top job in 2014, also struck an optimistic tone, arguing that Qualcomm can prosper without NXP because ""we have a good technology road map."" ""That technology road map is going to be valuable regardless of whatever the outcome is with NXP,"" Mr. Mollenkopf said.

The heart of that road map is 5G, industry shorthand for a next generation of ultrafast global cellular networks that Qualcomm has been helping to develop. Mr. Mollenkopf predicts 5G will take his company beyond its stronghold in smartphones. And since signing the deal for NXP, Qualcomm has made progress on its own in diversifying its business by selling more chips into cars, he added, with its backlog of chip orders from the auto industry recently totaling $4 billion. In addition, Mr. Mollenkopf said, if the NXP deal does not go through, Qualcomm plans a stock buyback of $20 billion to $30 billion to help lift its stock price. Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Sanford Bernstein, said Qualcomm's political stalemate with China and the question of whether the company could integrate NXP effectively had led some investors to prefer a buyback. ""People just want certainty, one way or another,"" he said. The fallout from the trade war is the latest challenge for Mr. Mollenkopf, who has been on the hot seat for much of his tenure as chief executive. Qualcomm has been hurt by slower sales of smartphones, while an unusual business model that combines patent licensing with chip sales has prompted antitrust squabbles on three continents.

More recently, after the Trump administration blocked the Broadcom bid, White House actions have been problematic for Qualcomm. In April, the administration issued an order preventing American companies from selling components to China's ZTE after finding that ZTE violated United States sanctions involving North Korea and Iran. ZTE is a major Qualcomm customer. Mr. Trump later softened his stance toward ZTE, which agreed to changes. The Commerce Department removed ZTE from a list of proscribed customers on Friday, enabling Qualcomm to resume selling chips to the Chinese company. It's unclear if China might now relent on NXP, or keep withholding approval of the deal to push back against the Trump administration's trade tariffs. ""One weapon is obviously the Qualcomm weapon,"" said Robert Atkinson, president of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank. China's antitrust authority, the State Administration for Market Regulation, did not respond to a faxed request for comment. The country would be the ninth jurisdiction to complete a customary antitrust review of Qualcomm's NXP deal; eight others, including the United States, have approved it. An NXP spokeswoman referred to recent remarks by Richard Clemmer, the company's chief executive, who said the chip maker continued to believe in the Qualcomm transaction. Mr. Mollenkopf embarked on the NXP deal nearly two years ago to reduce Qualcomm's dependence on the maturing mobile phone market. While Qualcomm primarily makes mobile chips and earns most of its profit from royalty payments from handset makers, NXP sells more than 14,000 different chips that are widely used in cars, mobile payments and other applications. The deal, announced in October 2016, seemed ambitious from the start. NXP has nearly as many employees as Qualcomm -- about 30,000 -- and a tradition of operating factories, which still make some of its products. Qualcomm has always relied on other companies to make the chips it designs.

Regulatory approval was expected to take time, with the companies predicting they would not be able to close the deal until the end of 2017. But the review has dragged on even longer. In Europe and South Korea, where Qualcomm has faced antitrust challenges from regulators, the authorities won concessions to make sure the company would not unfairly exploit patents on a payment technology called near-field communications it would acquire by buying NXP. China presented special issues. The country's regulatory authorities have taken an activist stance on antitrust reviews in the past few years. Qualcomm gets more than half of its revenue from the country, but its relations with customers and Beijing have not always been smooth. China's antitrust authority previously investigated Qualcomm and found in 2015 that its patent-licensing practices violated antimonopoly laws. Qualcomm agreed to pay a settlement of $975 million. Mr. Mollenkopf, who rose through Qualcomm's engineering ranks and helped lead chip development efforts, said the company had endured a turbulent period. But one thing is certain, he said: There will be no extension of the NXP deal deadline beyond next Wednesday, when Qualcomm reports quarterly earnings. ""We think NXP is a great deal for us,"" Mr. Mollenkopf said. ""If it doesn't get done, we also have means to create value in different ways.""","Qualcomm's chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf, needs Beijing's regulatory approval to buy another chip maker, NXP.

Style,"Why Justin Bieber, Chris Pratt and Offset Like to 'Double-Wrist'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/06/style/justin-bieber-offset-double-watch.html,"What fashion flourish is shared by Justin Bieber, Fidel Castro, Princess Diana and Drake? If you guessed ""double-wristing,"" the totally gratuitous but weirdly enduring practice of wearing two wristwatches at once, you're possibly guilty of the extraneous practice yourself. The head-scratching look, once favored by Hollywood's horological two-timers like Marlon Brando and Johnny Depp, has become picked up by a new generation of celebrities looking to double down on bling. It also appeals to techie watch aficionados who sport Apple watches but can't quit their Rolexes. Chris Pratt appeared on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" last March to promote ""The Kid,"" a gunslinging Western film, wearing a brawny and elegant Cartier watch on each wrist -- an action hero fashion gesture equivalent to flexing both biceps at once.

The look has been creeping into hip-hop circles for years, with Drake double-wristing Rolexes in his video for ""The Motto,"" from 2012, and the likes of Tyga and Gucci Mane experimenting with the look (Kanye West may or may not have endorsed the practice by rapping, ""That's why you always see me with at least one of my watches /Rollies and Pashas done drove me crazy,"" in ""All Falls Down"" from 2004).

Offset, the Migos rapper, often shows up at parties and fashion tents wearing, say, diamond-encrusted timepieces by Patek-Philippe and Audemars Piguet on each wrist. Why? Because he can, obviously. And also, perhaps, because he needs to keep up with his camera-magnet wife, Cardi B. Some Generation Z celebrities are taking the plunge, too. Billie Eilish, the teenage troubadour, has flashed two gold watches on the same wrist, upping the stakes in the rebel rocker tradition of wrist candy forged by bracelet-loving music artists like Keith Richards and Lil Wayne. In a sense, double-wristing speaks to the rising status of watches. Celebrity collectors like John Mayer, Ellen DeGeneres and LeBron James have made the five- or six-figure watch de rigueur on the red carpet, to the point where other celebrities feel the need to wear two statement watches to get noticed.

But there may be a practical reason, too. Diego Maradona, the Argentine soccer luminary, reportedly wears two watches (often a big-ticket Rolex and Hublot) when traveling: he sets one to his native time zone, the other to local time. It's the same reason cited by Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf. During the Gulf War, he set a Rolex on his left wrist to Saudi Arabian time and the Seiko on his right to Washington time. Likewise Fidel Castro, during his 1963 visit to the Soviet Union to meet Nikita S. Khrushchev, accessorized his fatigues with two Rolexes, which some observers believe were set to Havana and Moscow time. But maybe that is not the whole story. It doesn't take an evolutionary psychologist to see that men who double up on He-Man-esque accessories are making a not-so-subtle display of alpha male power.

That may explain why Adrian Broner, an American boxer who adopted the nickname About Billions, wore a pair of bejeweled timepieces at a news conference with Manny Pacquiao before their fight in Las Vegas last January. Sure, the baller overtones are less pronounced when one of the watches is an Apple Watch. Even so, the popularity of the smartwatch, as well as activity trackers like the Fitbit, has given double-wristing a noticeable boost, allowing watch geeks (including editors at the watch site Hodinkee) the opportunity to remain both stylish and connected.

""It can actually feel a bit transgressive,"" wrote Jack Forster, the site's editor in chief, in a post on the ""two-wrist tango"" in August. ""You are actually violating some taboo of which you were not previously aware,"" he added, ""because there had never been any particular reason to violate it before."" Mr. Forster has a point. No matter how elegant or wired the timepieces in question, it is a rebel move. Double-wristing is by definition a violation of style norms, in the same spirit as the dandies of 18th century England, who wore two pocket watches as way to elevate themselves from the dowdy masses. A poem from 1777, ""Receipt to Make a Modern Fop,"" included in its prescription: ""A lofty cane, a sword with silver hilt, a ring, two watches, and a snuff-box gilt."" In more modern times, it is a look that says, ""I break the rules because there are no rules."" Hunter S. Thompson, who was something of a fop himself with his safari jackets and cigarette holders, liked to double down on head-turning timepieces, including a so-called Rolex GMT-Master II with a red and black bezel known as the ""Coke.""",One fancy watch isn't enough for young Hollywood and watch geeks.,44225dbe-475f-5788-8196-f968c5be35a8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/07/fashion/31doublewristing-chris-pratt/31doublewristing-chris-pratt-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0e2bc72965a1b66c24831a80a08071016a02a2596a16ae3021911b496d4111be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Chris Pratt double-timing on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!""",44225dbe-475f-5788-8196-f968c5be35a8,N24News/imgs/44225dbe-475f-5788-8196-f968c5be35a8.jpg,15
Fashion & Style,From No Clothes to Almost No Clothes at Palomo Spain,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/fashion/paris-palomo-spain-casey-spooner.html,"From No Clothes to Almost No Clothes at Palomo Spain

PARIS -- ""Nude is my work look,"" Casey Spooner (Instagram @caseyspooner) said on a rainy evening, as he was ushered out of the chill and up the stairs of an 18th-century building on the elegant Place des Vosges. Mr. Spooner was on hand to see the Palomo Spain show, which opens men's fashion week here, and he was dressed head-to-toe for the occasion in one of the more subdued creations of its designer, Alejandro Gomez Palomo. ""Tonight, I'm going for Giorgio Sant'Angelo,"" the frontman of the performance troupe Fischerspooner added, referring to the flamboyant and award-winning Italian-Argentinian designer who died in 1989 of AIDS. And, in fact, his brashly patterned jumpsuit with its Cossack collar and matching kerchief headwrap was just the sort of thing Mr. Sant'Angelo might have worn for a coked-out revel at Studio 54.

""Her look was originally supposed to be mine,"" Mr. Spooner said, referring to his friend Jason Dardo, better known as Violet Chachki (Instagram @violetchachki), the drag burlesque performer who vanquished the competition in the seventh season of ""RuPaul's Drag Race."" Mr. Spooner meant the one-shouldered psychedelic pantsuit Ms. Chachki was wearing, an outfit that, as it turned out, didn't fit him.

""I'm a big girl,"" said the muscular Mr. Spooner, who has transformed himself for his coming tour into a contemporary version of the '70s gay porn star Peter Berlin. And he was not kidding about his work look. For a performance at Brooklyn Steel last fall and in various videos associated with ""SIR,"" the new Fischerspooner release, the performance artist, singer and all-around provocateur disported himself in every conceivable manner of shredded, studded, body-revealing raunch-wear that the Tony-award winning designer Jeff Mahshie could devise. When, that is, Mr. Spooner was wearing any clothes at all.

Mr. Spooner had been at the men's shows in Milan and returned on Tuesday to Paris, where he has taken up residence. Here on a visit a month ago, he missed his flight home to New York and impulsively decided to remain. ""It's time to be an expat and set up the next bohemian paradise compound where we can gather and conspire,"" he informed his followers on Instagram, where he is often pictured wearing little besides a huge fur coat that looks like Chewbacca's pelt.

""I had no clothes when I arrived"" in Europe, Mr. Spooner added plaintively on Tuesday, though Ms. Chachki was having none of it. ""She says that to everyone,"" the drag performer said, lowering the frames of her pink retro-Futurist sunglasses to throw Mr. Spooner some shade. ""Now everyone gives her looks. She's a total looks-whore."" If Mr. Gomez Palomo was among those designers who quickly came to Mr. Spooner's sartorial assistance, he was in good company. Miuccia Prada and others in Milan generously sent clothes to keep the performer from going naked to assorted fashion-show front rows.

Yet Palomo Spain may be the best fit of all, since the label designed by Mr. Gomez has, in less than two years, made a singular mark on the industry with designs that don't test gender binaries so much as flout their existence. True to form, in a presentation titled ""Hunting"" and shown under black lights in a friend's apartment hung with a huge Gilbert & George work and decorated to look like a forest, the Spanish designer sent out a giddy assortment of his frilly, sometimes feminine, often historicist, always ornamented and minimally concealing designs for brocade chaps, opera cloaks, sleeveless jerkins with shoulder ruffles, peekaboo lace surplices, trailing gowns (yes, for men), velvet lounge suits, tunics resembling chain mail, marabou-trimmed tabarro capes and ruched velvet bloomers from which the models' skinny hairy legs protruded obscenely.","The performer Casey Spooner spent part of the men's wear show lamenting his lack of wardrobe before Alejandro Gómez Palomo, Miuccia Prada and others stepped in.",508003cf-2b63-53be-9c3e-0d3c14dda235,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/17/fashion/17palomo-1/17palomo-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=4fd97377ee90dcc7e996818f0e6e35921ca23161ef2388846dabddfd7c5454d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Palomo Spain, fall 2018.",508003cf-2b63-53be-9c3e-0d3c14dda235,N24News/imgs/508003cf-2b63-53be-9c3e-0d3c14dda235.jpg,19

After slowing sales amid fears of terrorist attacks, unpredictable stock markets and currency fluctuations that kept many tourists away from cities including Paris, the market will return to growth in 2017, according to the Bain report, the Worldwide Luxury Market Monitor, which was released on Monday. The report estimates a global personal luxury goods market of 254 billion euros to EUR259 billion ($284 billion to $289 billion) in 2017, assuming constant exchange rates, up 2 percent to 4 percent from EUR249 billion last year.

""It is a sad state of affairs, but people are becoming more accustomed to uncertainty being part of their lives,"" said Claudia D'Arpizio, a partner at Bain who specializes in the luxury and fashion industries. ""The impact of events like terror attacks are becoming less strong on the luxury market.""

The stronger forecast for 2017 stems from three factors, Ms. D'Arpizio said: a resurgence in Chinese consumer spending, both at home and abroad; a return of tourism confidence in Europe; and efforts by luxury brands to identify and respond to the tastes of specific groups of consumers, particularly millennials.","The sector is expected to benefit from Chinese consumer spending, a return of tourism confidence in Europe and efforts by luxury brands to cater to millennials.",ed6278b9-2703-51d7-a6b5-e424126b17a2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/29/fashion/29Bainluxury/29Bainluxury-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d741e2cf6677639f2cdaf88da793963c50b16fcf72154d0d055b3f91192fc0d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A luxury shopping mall in Milan.

Books,7 Takeaways From Mary Trump's Book About Her Uncle Donald,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review/mary-trump-book-takeaways.html,"In the prologue of ""Too Much and Never Enough,"" Mary Trump writes: ""The media failed to notice that not one member of Donald's family, apart from his children, his son-in-law and his current wife, said a word in support of him during the entire campaign."" That doesn't mean they had no opinions. The daughter of the president's older brother, Freddy, who died in 1981, now shares some of hers -- not just by airing the family's dirty laundry, but by washing and folding it, too. (Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist whose diagnoses for her uncle are as varied and extensive as the fast food buffet he offered the Clemson Tigers when they visited the White House in 2019.)

[ Read Jennifer Szalai's review of ""Too Much and Never Enough."" ]

Here are seven insights gleaned from reading the first niece.

Nothing Donald Trump said during his campaign deviated from Mary Trump's expectations of him.

""I was reminded of every family meal I'd ever attended during which Donald had talked about all of the women he considered ugly fat slobs or the men, usually more accomplished or powerful, he called losers,"" she writes. ""That kind of casual dehumanization of people was commonplace at the Trump dinner table.""

The author declined an invitation to an election night party in New York City.

Her reason: ""I wouldn't be able to contain my euphoria when Clinton's victory was announced, and I didn't want to be rude."" In the months following her uncle's inauguration, ""the smallest thing -- seeing Donald's face or hearing my own name, both of which happened dozens of times a day -- took me back to the time when my father had withered and died beneath the cruelty and contempt of my grandfather. I had lost him when he was only 42 and I was 16. The horror of Donald's cruelty was being magnified by the fact that his acts were now official U.S. policy, affecting millions of people.""","Growing up Trump wasn't easy. There were feuds, grudges and spanking with a wooden spoon. Now, there's the burden of the name.",e8b16275-4733-5e86-aaee-6637dda7d6aa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/14/books/review/14Egan/14Egan-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bb82269fd1183bb4bdb96fff94c30a01bd57618445cff35bb3a796e2c64763e0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Donald Trump and his mother, Mary, at his 50th birthday party at Trump Tower in 1996.",e8b16275-4733-5e86-aaee-6637dda7d6aa,N24News/imgs/e8b16275-4733-5e86-aaee-6637dda7d6aa.jpg,13
Books,Books for Budding Art Lovers,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/books/review/flying-paintings-the-zhou-brothers-a-story-of-revolution-and-art.html,"FLYING PAINTINGS: The Zhou Brothers: A Story of Revolution and Art (Candlewick Press, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 5 to 9) takes us all the way from Wuming, China, during the Cultural Revolution, to the South Side of Chicago during Reaganomics; from childhood to adulthood, and from obscurity to world renown, in the lives of the Zhou brothers, DaHuang and ShanZuo, celebrated contemporary artists who have worked collaboratively since 1973. Their body of work includes large-scale paintings on canvas that are the result of a process not unlike a dance performance, and sculptural work ranging from small maquettes to large installations. The title of the book is based on childhood stories told by their grandmother of paintings that flew through the air and landed on mountain cliffs.

The skillful pacing and careful choice of words in this book will appeal to children in the same way that a soul-stirring melody sung by a loving parent can bring a baby to tears. And yet the writing is not sentimental in the least. Cherished relatives are dispatched from this world with economy: ""Four years passed. Beloved Po Po died."" A refrain that marks each milestone in the brothers' lives is the matter-of-fact observation that the world, and just about everything in it, is both ""beautiful and terrible"" at the same time. There is no attempt in this book, whose illustrations were painted by the Zhous themselves, to paper over how difficult it has been for the siblings to work shoulder to shoulder over the decades. ""How dare you destroy my work?"" one says to the other during a confrontation. At its core, the book is about staring down adversity with passion and humility. We are reminded that though the act of weathering life's many ups and downs is difficult, it is mostly worth the trouble.

At the time, glassmaking was considered the exclusive domain of men, but Marietta was desperate to learn. Taunted and chased away by her brothers, she took the heat and returned every day until her father finally relented. For a story that begins with the sentence ""Marietta loved to watch the sun,"" A THOUSAND GLASS FLOWERS: Marietta Barovier and the Invention of the Rosetta Bead (Atheneum Books for Young Readers, 48 pp., $17.99; ages 4 to 8) is a fanciful, if not blindingly brilliant, tale of Marietta's culture and exploits. By contrast, Evan Turk's illustrations are brilliant. Though books are only ink on paper, this art manages to conjure the heat of the furnace and the ethereal delicacy of Murano glass.

Lotte Reiniger was a pioneer in the fields of film and animation technology. She invented the multiplane camera in 1923 and used it to create one of the first feature-length animated films in 1926. Using silhouette animation, ""The Adventures of Prince Achmed"" is a lovingly crafted masterwork of avant-garde art that has stood the test of time. Most cinephiles agree that Disney owes Reiniger a debt of gratitude. Told in rhyming verse, LOTTE'S MAGICAL PAPER PUPPETS: The Woman Behind the First Animated Feature Film (Page Street Kids, 40 pp., $18.99; ages 7 to 10) traces the main events and artistic achievements in Reiniger's life. Having focused her talents on silhouette paper cutting since 2008, the greeting card entrepreneur and illustrator Kathryn Carr was a perfect choice for this book. She manages to walk the difficult high-wire act of honoring Reiniger's oeuvre while remaining true to her own work. On the other hand, choosing to tackle the biography of a life well lived in rhyming verse is more of a self-imposed walk on the wire. And despite a few stumbles -- according to my tin ear -- Brooke Hartman sort of pulls it off.

MODERN ART EXPLORER: Discover the Stories Behind Artworks by Matisse, Kahlo and More (Thames & Hudson, 96 pp., $19.95; ages 9 to 12) achieves a different type of feat: pulling together an overview of the Centre Pompidou's vast collection of more than a century of modern art, made between the 1860s and the late 1960s, for an audience of children and adults. Without doubt, it is a very good thing that there are bright lights out there like Alice Harman, the book's inventive writer (""Can you believe it? Someone's dumped a pile of junk in the middle of this art gallery. Unbelievable. Excuse me, security, can we get this removed?""), and Serge Bloch, the book's veteran illustrator, known across the globe for transforming a fried egg into a nose (or was it the other way around?), who here replaces Duchamp's ""Chocolate Grinder"" with a common meat grinder. The gendarmerie have been notified!

DRAWING ON WALLS: A Story of Keith Haring (Enchanted Lion, 64 pp., $18.95; ages 6 to 14) is a tender and beautifully written biography of Haring's short life. Matthew Burgess, the book's talented writer, set out to tell Haring's tale without embellishment, sugarcoating or regret. The result is a joyful celebration of Haring's world. In finding a way to address the artist's homosexuality and AIDS diagnosis, Burgess took inspiration from comments Haring made in an interview some 30 years ago with Rolling Stone about the pitfalls of not being honest: ""It gives so much fuel to the people who are telling you that it's wrong to be who you are. There are so few people who are good openly gay role models or just good people who are respected who are open about their sexuality. Now there has to be openness about all these issues."" Josh Cochran, the book's illustrator, who pays tribute to Haring in his own unique style, was similarly inspired by a mural of Haring's he walked by almost every day while in design school: ""The casual fat lines crisscrossing, the vivid washes of color, even the accidental drips are simultaneously effortless and brilliant. ... Drawing as stream-of-consciousness poetry is something that I absorbed in large part from Keith."" So, did this investigation answer the opening question? Are the people responsible for creating these five books sane and sensible?","New picture books explore the life of Keith Haring, the collection of the Centre Pompidou in Paris, the work of the Zhou brothers and much more.",c76f9857-b8ff-57a4-bb4d-6642ebbb97ee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/06/books/review/06Viva_Image1/06Viva_Image1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=15d498406bfa65a676eb9e895f5ec4d0c42a72acf6d411297c4ea643305fdc87&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From ""Drawing on Walls: A Story of Keith Haring.""

Style,"At Tiffany, Something New Inside the Blue Box",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/16/style/at-tiffany-something-new-inside-the-blue-box.html,"Back in February at the Academy Awards, the Australian actress Cate Blanchett made her usual regal turn on the red carpet, a vision of cool beauty in a silk velvet sheath. The dress, designed by John Galliano for Maison Margiela, was so conspicuous for its lack of frippery it might have easily been interpreted as an emblem of Mr. Galliano's continuing public chastening. The point was not the dress, however. The dress was just a foil for what was draped about Ms. Blanchett's milky throat. To call the jeweled bib she wore that evening a ""statement"" necklace, as many did, was a bald understatement. Five hundred carats of turquoise beads undulated on its surface, held in place with diamond-capped pins. Beneath them lay a platinum armature to which were affixed 400 additional carats of stones -- turquoise cabochon, faceted diamonds, aquamarines all contrived to imitate the effect of sunlight refracted through water. Whether the 36.6 million Oscars viewers were aware of this subtlety, the scene-stealing bib had the commercially desirable effect of making the million-dollar gems on other entertainers look like so much borrowed ice.

The frenzy of social media ""likes"" and ""favorites"" flew so fast that evening that, seemingly before the telecast had drawn to a merciful conclusion, a Chinese manufacturer had already gone into production with a knockoff of the $400,000 jewel, some bright light at Us Weekly hatched plans to sponsor a reader contest offering as a prize a $75 faux turquoise collar inspired Ms. Blanchett's necklace, and it became very clear to a lot of people that -- for the first time in a long while -- Tiffany & Company had stolen the show. ""You have a company that's 177 years old and still here,"" Stellene Volandes, executive style director of Town & Country, recently said of the company. ""A piece like the one Francesca designed is modern but also recognizes Tiffany's heritage and that much of the company's future lies in what's been done in the past."" She was referring to Francesca Amfitheatrof, little known outside the industry and a stealth force within it, not only the first woman in the history of Tiffany & Company to be named design director but also one of only a handful of trained jewelers ever to hold that job.

Still, ""If you really think of Tiffany & Company in the last couple of decades, there's not been very much new or creative,"" said Daniela Mascetti, a senior specialist in jewelry for Sotheby's in Geneva. ""They have a legacy to respect but at the same time need to come up with new ideas to bring Tiffany to the forefront again."" With the unveiling early this month of her first Blue Book -- a catalog displaying 230 examples of so-called ""high jewelry"" -- Ms. Amfitheatrof makes strides in that direction, showcasing a series of one-of-a-kind pieces, like the Blanchett necklace, that stand as an artistic statement of intent. First published in 1845 as a ""Catalogue of Useful and Fancy Articles,"" the Blue Book catalog long ago abandoned any illusion of utility -- unless, that is, one's idea of a necessity runs to $100,000 tanzanite and platinum rings. (Whether or how much Ms. Blanchett was paid to wear the Amfitheatrof design to the Oscars is a matter of some conjecture. It is well known that many entertainers are richly remunerated for their red carpet loyalty. Asked whether Ms. Blanchett was one such star, a Tiffany & Company spokeswoman replied, ""Cate Blanchett is a friend of Tiffany's."") While wealthy clients queue up each year for the Blue Book rarities produced at Tiffany's specialized workshops above the landmark Fifth Avenue store, the catalog's real purpose is to increase the luster of a luxury brand in an increasingly competitive market and deflect attention from the fact that Tiffany's bottom line is built on far more prosaic stuff. Even in boom times, a limited number of clients exist for a $400,000 necklace. Yet come June, high school graduates by the thousands are likely to open a trademark Tiffany & Company robin's egg blue box and find inside one of the jeweler's classic best sellers, Elsa Peretti's silver heart on a chain -- priced $200. More than one year in the making, the objects in ""The Art of the Sea"" collection are a reflection of Ms. Amfitheatrof's lifelong obsession with water, the element in which she has always felt most at ease, and one she has drawn on time and again as a metaphorical force. ""I've always had a huge draw to the ocean, just massive,"" Ms. Amfitheatrof said in early February at the annual American Gem Trade Association fair in Tucson. There, for several days, dealers from all over the world congregated with their precious wares. ""Whether it's off Patmos in Greece or in Wellfleet, the minute I'm in the water, I'm so affected by it my heartbeat changes,"" she said.

As gem dealers unlocked safes to display treasures like an 8.25-carat Mozambican ruby or a pinkish padparadscha sapphire, Ms. Amfitheatrof cannily studied and rated each in turn. Cradling the stones between the ring and index fingers of her downturned hand, she noted that while some seemed nearly radioactive in their brilliance, others were duller than beach glass. ""I don't think about the value of the materials all that much,"" she said. And it is true that in her work she tends to treat precious and base materials alike, oxidizing gold to blacken it, pairing relatively worthless minerals like rock crystal with platinum, setting semiprecious gems like opals in diamond-studded bracelets. ""I mean, sometimes, when I hear the numbers it's like, 'Holy cow,' "" Ms. Amfitheatrof added in the accent of the English schools where she received a substantial part of her education. ""But in general I try not to be intimidated and just focus on the design."" In this she draws inspiration from two designers who have served as collaborators and mentors across her decades-long career. ""Whenever I get into a pickle in design, or anything, really, I think, 'What would Karl do?' "" Ms. Amfitheatrof said not long ago at the Tiffany & Company Fifth Avenue workrooms, referring to Karl Lagerfeld, her onetime boss at Chanel. ""Karl always says: 'Just say yes, darling. And then do whatever you want.' "" Another good friend, the designer Alexander McQueen, frequently goaded Ms. Amfitheatrof to flout convention, to stretch the parameters of taste. ""Whenever I face a problem in the studio, I hear Lee in my ear,"" Ms. Amfitheatrof said, referring to Mr. McQueen by his familiar first name. ""It's him saying: 'Push it, Francesca. Push it! Do more!' ""

Daughter of an American journalist and an Italian publicist, Ms. Amfitheatrof, 44, was born in Tokyo, where her father was then posted as the Time bureau chief. Though a United States citizen, she spent a nomadic childhood attending schools in England and Italy, where her paternal grandparents (her grandfather was the Hollywood composer Daniele Amfitheatrof) moved to help raise her and a sister during their father's stint as the Moscow bureau chief for Time. Ms. Amfitheatrof's decision to bypass an Ivy League education in favor of art school was no less shocking to her parents than was her decision to major in, of all things, jewelry design. ""My father wanted me to go to Harvard,"" she said. ""I got the application and secretly threw it out."" Instead, she went first to the Chelsea School of Arts, later Central Saint Martins and the Royal College of Art in London, where upon graduation she almost immediately began working as a designer of everything from furniture to jewelry to buttons for a roster of storied labels: Marni, Fendi, Wedgwood, Alessi, Asprey & Garrard.

Underscoring that notion, Mr. Solca noted in an email a pressing need for Tiffany & Company ""to upgrade its perception in the U.S. and come up with stronger and more consistent merchandising."" Central to that goal, of course, is preserving Tiffany's status as an iconic American brand while adapting to the new realities of a global marketplace. Nearly a quarter of Tiffany's overall revenues came from the Asia-Pacific region in 2014. ""Francesca has a very clear aesthetic, and you saw that in the first collection of Tiffany T bangles, all pure form and line,"" said Ms. Volandes, of Town & Country. Both, as it happens, were attributes prized by Charles Lewis Tiffany, who helped found a store that sold stationery and fancy goods in 1837 with a $1,000 grubstake from his father. ""Charles Lewis Tiffany always attributed the company's success to one thing,"" John Loring, the company's design director emeritus, said recently by telephone from Florida. ""Simplicity."" With the Blue Book collection, Ms. Amfitheatrof makes clear her broader artistic ambitions are perhaps less aligned with ideals of simplicity as espoused by signature Tiffany minimalists like Ms. Peretti than perhaps with the aesthetic of Jean Schlumberger, a man experts consider to have been one of the greatest jewelers of the 20th century, and who designed for the company from 1956 until his retirement in the 1970s. While just two pieces in the Blue Book collection derive directly from Schlumberger designs, the entire suite seems infused with his exploratory spirit, instinctive feel for organic forms and wit. ""You know, I'm particularly interested in the process of thinking through art and design,"" Ms. Amfitheatrof said recently. ""I want to apply process and experimentation to the creation of jewelry, not concepts and themes. I'm not thinking, 'Who is the woman this jewel is designed for?' It's a bit more of a cerebral path, a constant search for ways to push the edges out.""","Francesca Amfitheatrof, Tiffany & Company's design director, is restoring artistic luster to the storied jeweler with pieces like the statement necklace that Cate Blanchett wore to the Academy Awards.",bc9d294a-d708-5de0-bf18-28df98cac596,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/16/fashion/16TIFFANYJP3/16TIFFANYJP3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4754a85e592235ed02c820b8ed0aca3cd033cc42766bb8f685271349cb786be5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Cate Blanchett in the Tiffany & Company necklace designed by Ms. Amfitheatrof at the Academy Awards in February.,bc9d294a-d708-5de0-bf18-28df98cac596,N24News/imgs/bc9d294a-d708-5de0-bf18-28df98cac596.jpg,15
Style,The Shaky Moral Compass of Silicon Valley,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/07/style/the-shaky-moral-compass-of-silicon-valley.html,"When I lived in Silicon Valley, I was struck by not just the region's income disparity, but also by the lack of compassion that wealthy tech workers sometimes displayed toward the poor. I would overhear tech employees complain about the homeless in degrading ways -- at coffee shops, bars and in parks. Sometimes their disgust spread online. One notorious example took place in 2013, when Greg Gopman, then the chief executive of AngelHack, a code start-up, lamented on Facebook, ""why the heart of our city has to be overrun by crazy, homeless, drug dealers, dropouts, and trash I have no clue."" (He later deleted the post.) This is not exactly in keeping with the Valley's self-designated catchphrase: ""We're making the world a better place."" Homelessness is everywhere in the Valley. Consider the proximity of the Jungle, an encampment in San Jose, Calif., where 350 homeless people lived in tents and shacks. The Jungle sat like the backdrop for a dystopian sci-fi novel in the shadow of Apple, Google and other tech giants until it was shut down last year after pressure from neighbors and water-quality regulators. Or consider how a 24-hour bus route in Palo Alto becomes an impromptu homeless shelter at night.

The wayward moral compass of the Valley also manifests itself in the bizarrely frivolous things that some tech execs pursue: an Uber for private jets, a social network for the 1 percent and a dating app only for rich men. Sure, every city has its homeless problems (Los Angeles's Skid Row sits a few miles away from Beverly Hills), but Silicon Valley is supposed to be different, making the world a better ... you get the point. Paul K. Piff, a professor of psychology and social behavior at the University of California, Irvine, believes all the money sloshing around the Valley could make some tech executives unaware of their surroundings. He has conducted several social experiments that consistently show that when people gain access to money, their empathy toward the less fortunate falls and, at the same time, their sense of entitlement and self-interest rises. ""With money comes a decreased level of compassion towards other people and an increased focus on yourself,"" Dr. Piff said. ""It isn't that it is making people bad. It just makes them more internally focused."" In one study, Dr. Piff rigged a two-person game of Monopoly to ensure that one participant had the upper hand. Before long, the person who started to win began displaying mean tendencies toward the loser. In another study, Dr. Piff found that poor people gave away more money to people in need than the rich do.

Other researchers have found that just thinking about money can have a similar effect. Kathleen D. Vohs, a professor of marketing at the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota, conducted an experiment in which two groups sat in front of a computer screen saver. One group saw fish swim by, the other saw money. ""The group that sees the money will be self-concerned, they'll use the word 'I' and 'me' more, and they are really worried about what they'll get out of the situation,"" Dr. Vohs said. ""They are also not very good interpersonally; they are not helpful, not kind, not empathetic."" All this, she added, can happen just by thinking about money. While Dr. Vohs's and Dr. Piff's social experiments are mostly lab-based, and can be applied to anyone with money, they can be illustrative of the way many tech workers live, and why some may be oblivious to the plight of those around them. Silicon Valley has been called the greatest creation of wealth in history. A report last year found that the average tech worker's pay in San Mateo County, home to East Palo Alto and Menlo Park, is $291,497 a year. Even the interns in tech are rich, with some making $75,000 a year, more than the median household income in the United States. Moreover, those who are not superrich often live as if they are. Employees at large tech companies commute in free first-class buses and work on campuses filled with numerous perks like free sushi, massages and yoga classes. This is not to say that everybody in the Valley lacks compassion. There are plenty of tech workers who volunteer (and don't advertise their good deeds on Facebook). Mr. Gopman, who once compared the homeless to ""trash,"" has become an advocate for people in need, he said in an interview, and recently started a nonprofit to tackle San Francisco's homeless crisis.

Big-name tech executives are involved in the effort, too. Ron Conway, a highly influential investor, has focused some of his philanthropy on homelessness. And Marc Benioff, the chief executive of Salesforce, has been very vocal about getting fellow techies to adopt a ""pay as you go"" model for charitable giving, rather than a ""pay at the end"" model, after retirement. (He has given away well over $150 million.) ""There is now a huge hunger and desire on the part of employees at many of the start-ups I work with to want to do something -- to try and give back -- but there is a lack of understanding about what is it they can do,"" said James Higa, a former executive at Apple and now the executive director at Philanthropic Ventures Foundation, a nonprofit in the Bay Area. He added that thinking about how to give back, and solving intractable problems like homelessness, can be a lot more difficult than coming up with a good idea for a start-up. Especially a start-up that is ""making the world a better place.""","Silicon Valley creates wealth at a staggering clip, but many of its companies' and executives' philanthropy has not kept pace.",c327fc03-f5ff-5479-b43a-763b1b622274,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/07/fashion/07DISRUPTIONS/07DISRUPTIONS-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=672cbc6fbd5260ab820a28767663659bba313d95fad26da239bbb91f16cffa46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Jungle, a homeless encampment of tents and shacks in San Jose, Calif., was cleared in December of last year.",c327fc03-f5ff-5479-b43a-763b1b622274,N24News/imgs/c327fc03-f5ff-5479-b43a-763b1b622274.jpg,15
Automobiles,"Once a Hit With Campers, Now Working With Pampers",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/automobiles/once-a-hit-with-campers-now-working-with-pampers.html,"You can take the S.U.V. out of the country. Apparently, you can also take the country out of the S.U.V. The rise of the citified crossover has helped to close the barn door on sport utilities that built a reputation on rugged backcountry virtues. Whole swaths of manly-men trucks have vanished, from Hummers and Chevy TrailBlazers to Isuzu Troopers and Mitsubishi Monteros. Even 4-wheeling nameplates that once ruled the suburban commuter trails, like the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand Cherokee, have been forced to adapt or die, becoming so carlike and digitized that owners of the originals would barely recognize the latest generations. For brands that offer a choice between pure crossovers and more traditional S.U.V.'s, the identity crisis is particularly acute. As Americans vote for all-wheel-drive crossovers with not a whit of off-road pretensions -- the Toyota Highlander and Nissan Murano come to mind -- it's harder to find fulfilling roles for a hard-core Toyota 4Runner or Nissan Pathfinder.

Rather than retire the grizzled warriors, some automakers continue to soften and compromise them, sometimes to dubious effect: the 4Runner is a pale shadow of its rebellious self of the 1980s and '90s. The Pathfinder fares better, but tiptoes down the same bumpy road: it can't get too fancy-pants and reject its country roots, or its small-town, dirt-road buds -- the ones who grew up with it and know it best -- would accuse it of selling out. On the other hand, the Nissan has to grow up and take on three-row family duties or it's not going to have a job anymore. The result is a Pathfinder that, like the latest Explorer, throws a few bones at 4-wheeling fans even as it winks at the real target: moms and dads obsessed with numbers, counting two kids (at least), three rows, seven seats and as many miles per gallon as possible. Oh, and please don't let it look like a minivan. The Pathfinder avoids the minivan styling curse, but what's left hardly seems a bragging point. The Nissan seems to wear its existential conflict on its sleeve: what am I, and why am I here? The front is barrel-chested, with a black mesh grille that looks eager to suck up mud and win points with papa. From there, the Nissan goes as soft as spoiled fruit, with a falling roofline and awkward bulges to distract you from its suburban banality. It's more evidence that Nissan designers seem lost of late, the 370Z and Juke aside.

By switching to a car-type unibody platform, the Pathfinder sheds about 500 pounds, weighing about 4,300 total. And that's despite a growth spurt of about 4.5 inches in length and four in width, with a three-inch lower roofline. The Pathfinder also adopts a powertrain that's more car than truck: Nissan's workhorse 3.5-liter V-6 -- here with 260 horsepower and 240 pound-feet of torque -- linked to a fuel-saving variable automatic transmission. That engine replaces a 4-liter V-6 that made 6 more horses and 48 more pound-feet, but was cruder and thirstier. The slimmer Pathfinder manages 20 m.p.g. in town and 26 on the highway with 2-wheel drive, or 19/25 m.p.g. with 4-wheel drive. (Nissan's ""best in class"" fuel mileage claim overlooks the same-size Ford Explorer, which gets 20/28 m.p.g. with the EcoBoost turbo 4-cylinder.) Over a three-hour highway run in the Pathfinder, I achieved 24 m.p.g. I was suspicious of how smoothly a continuously variable transmission, which eliminates the conventional stepped gears, would mate to an S.U.V. But the Pathfinder's throttle is well matched to the C.V.T., allowing feathery inputs to keep pace with traffic without making the engine rev obtrusively. While Nissan's C.V.T.'s are among the industry's smoothest, summoning a burst of acceleration results in an engine surge to high r.p.m., amplifying the somewhat coarse sound of the V-6. The interior feels traditional and utilitarian, with a bluff dashboard and more knock-knock hard plastic than in some competitors. But the amenities are all here once you move up from the basic rear-drive Pathfinder S ($29,495). The gauges and center navigation screen are large and readable; the controls are mostly straightforward. The faux wood and metal finishes of my Platinum test model looked solid. That range-topping Platinum 4WD version starts at $41,995 and rose to $43,850 for the well-optioned test truck.

Nissan's vexing weather alerts were in full effect, a synthetic female voice warning me ad nauseum of supposed flood risks in neighboring New Jersey even when there wasn't a cloud in the sky. The Nissan's strong suit is interior space, despite a third row seat that's typical of this class: The lankier your body, the more you'll complain about the coach seating. The third row does recline slightly, helping matters. Fight for the second row, and the reward is outstanding legroom, aided by 5.5 inches of fore-and-aft sliding for the split seats. Flip a lever in that second row, and the seatback and cushion slide forward and sandwich in an efficient clamshell arrangement. That opens up easy third-row access, even when a child seat is strapped into the folding second row. And the seats return to their original position without excessive wrestling. As with the Explorer, there's no low-range setting for serious off-roading. But a three-mode console knob lets drivers select full-time 2-wheel-drive to save fuel; pick an automatic mode that engages 4-wheel traction when the wheels slip; or lock the system into full-time all-wheel drive. Hill Start Assist, which is standard, holds the vehicle steady on steep grades. On the road, the Nissan feels steady and workmanlike, more truckish than some car-based crossovers. The steering has pleasing heft, but there's body lean in swift corners and some structural shimmy over rough roads. The Explorer's superior body control makes it seem to shrink around the driver; the Nissan never lets you forget you're pushing a relatively big rig. In the old days, you didn't necessarily need a family to want a Pathfinder, a 4Runner or, before those, the Jeep Wagoneer. Their outdoorsy nature and scouting skills appealed even to singles who knew their way around a campsite. This Pathfinder is different. Sure, it will navigate a rutted dirt road or deep snow. But I can't imagine anyone without children having the slightest inclination to own one. If you're into real off-roading, buy a Jeep Wrangler. Place the Pathfinder on the growing list of one-time mudders that had to scrub up to survive.","The Nissan Pathfinder throws a few bones at 4-wheeling fans, but its real target is parents who want three rows, seven seats and as many miles per gallon as possible.",87502ce0-1a71-5a54-827b-85df3eb227f4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/26/automobiles/Wheel/Wheel-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=345&w=600&s=616c68a3848328a1443cce68e9c2b71f92b55bb14ab52c3332a894dac36e7fcc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"CIVILIZATION BOUND The larger, lighter and less trucklike 2013 Pathfinder is looking for a new line of work.",87502ce0-1a71-5a54-827b-85df3eb227f4,N24News/imgs/87502ce0-1a71-5a54-827b-85df3eb227f4.jpg,23
Media,Disney Cuts Ties With ABC News Executive Over 'Racially Insensitive' Remarks,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/business/media/disney-abc-news-barbara-fedida.html,"The Walt Disney Company said in an internal memo on Monday that it had cut ties with a top ABC News executive after an investigation backed complaints that she had made racist remarks in the workplace.

The executive, Barbara Fedida, 52, had worked at ABC for most of her roughly two-decade career, save for a five-year stint as the head of talent development at CBS News from 2006 to 2011. As the senior vice president of talent relations and business affairs at ABC News, she had a hand in selecting on-air talent for programs like ""Good Morning America,"" ""ABC World News Tonight With David Muir"" and ""Nightline.""

Last month HuffPost reported that Ms. Fedida had made insensitive statements, including racist comments, at work. During a salary negotiation with the ""Good Morning America"" anchor Robin Roberts, who is Black, Ms. Fedida said the company was not asking her to ""pick cotton,"" according to the article.

Disney, the owner of ABC, put Ms. Fedida on administrative leave soon after the article was published and hired the law firm Proskauer Rose to conduct an investigation. On Monday, Peter Rice, the chairman of Walt Disney Television, informed the staff of her departure in a memo that was reviewed by The New York Times.","The executive, Barbara Fedida, has left the company after an investigation supported complaints about her workplace comments.",cbb20c59-baf3-5b27-b2f4-b79c41b56d01,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/21/business/21abcnews-fedida-01/21abcnews-fedida-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=03615156bdbdd12c4aa9f88258bc45ffbc89e6eb7aa6e995f9aa98fb044092d7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Barbara Fedida, a top news executive, worked in network television for roughly two decades before her departure from ABC News.",cbb20c59-baf3-5b27-b2f4-b79c41b56d01,N24News/imgs/cbb20c59-baf3-5b27-b2f4-b79c41b56d01.jpg,16
Technology,Zoom Executive Accused of Disrupting Calls at China's Behest,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/18/technology/zoom-tiananmen-square.html,"In a novel case, federal prosecutors on Friday brought criminal charges against an executive at Zoom, the videoconferencing company, accusing him of engaging in a conspiracy to disrupt and censor video meetings commemorating one of the most politically sensitive events in China. Prosecutors said the executive, Xinjiang Jin, who is based in China, fabricated reasons to suspend accounts of people in New York who were hosting memorials on the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre and coordinated with Chinese officials to identify potentially problematic meetings. He is accused of working with others to log into the video meetings under aliases using profile pictures that related to terrorism or child pornography. Afterward, Mr. Jin would report the meetings for violating terms of service, prosecutors said. At least four meetings commemorating the massacre this year -- largely attended by U.S.-based users -- were terminated as a result of Mr. Jin's actions, according to prosecutors.

Mr. Jin, who is also known as Julien Jin, acted as the liaison between Zoom and Chinese government authorities, prosecutors said. He is identified in the criminal complaint only as an employee of a U.S. telecommunications company. Zoom confirmed on Friday that it was the company. Mr. Jin has not been arrested and is at large in China, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States.

The case represented an unusually sharp warning by law enforcement officials to American technology companies that operate in China, which often find themselves caught between the principles of free speech and the demands of China's censorship machine. ""Americans should understand that the Chinese government will not hesitate to exploit companies operating in China to further their international agenda, including repression of free speech,"" Christopher Wray, director of the F.B.I., said in a statement.

A spokesman for Zoom said on Friday that Mr. Jin violated its policies by attempting to circumvent internal controls. Mr. Jin has been fired, and other Zoom employees have been placed on administrative leave pending the completion of an internal investigation. In a lengthy statement, the company said it has since provided end-to-end encryption for all users and restricted access for China-based employees to Zoom's global network. The company has its headquarters in San Jose, Calif., and has hundreds of employees in China. Charging a China-based employee working for an American company is an aggressive rebuke against China, which requires tech companies that operate there to monitor user activity in order to censor politically sensitive topics. Seth DuCharme, the acting U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, whose office brought the case, said the allegations exposed the security vulnerabilities of American tech companies that engage in the ""Faustian bargain"" of operating in China.

The U.S. attorney's office in Brooklyn has been particularly active in bringing cases that have angered the Chinese government, including a criminal case against Huawei, the Chinese telecommunications giant, and charges against eight people accused of conspiring on behalf of China to harass political dissidents in the United States to return home. Mr. Jin was charged with conspiracy to commit interstate harassment and illegal conspiracy to transfer means of identification. A lawyer for Mr. Jin could not be identified. The case is also a black eye for Zoom, raising fresh questions about the company's security at a time when its software is heavily relied on for work, school, health care and more.

Mr. Jin asked co-workers for user data from American servers, which he did not have direct access to, prosecutors said. It was not clear how much access Chinese government officials have obtained to the account information of Zoom users in the United States. The spokesman for Zoom said the company's internal investigation revealed that Mr. Jin shared individual user data with Chinese authorities. He shared the data for ""fewer than 10 individual users"" who were based outside China, the company said. The criminal complaint portrayed a relentless effort by Mr. Jin and others to stop video meetings commemorating the anniversary of the massacre, on June 4. In the weeks before the anniversary, Mr. Jin warned a co-worker in the United States that Chinese officials were tracking Zoom users and emphasized the need to keep secret demands by the Chinese government for censorship, according to the criminal complaint. ""They request that we cannot disclose it,"" Mr. Jin wrote. ""Otherwise it will greatly impact our country's reputation."" Mr. Jin told the colleague that if the Tiananmen Square issue was poorly handled, China could block the company's servers, according to prosecutors. In another instance, Chinese government officials notified Mr. Jin of a planned American-based Tiananmen Square memorial and provided him with the meeting number of the video call, which Mr. Jin was then able to terminate, prosecutors said. It was not clear how officials obtained the meeting number, as it had not been publicized, according to prosecutors.",U.S. prosecutors have charged a company executive based in China with conspiring to terminate online meetings about the Tiananmen Square massacre.,ea0bb48f-bd03-56c3-b759-44b7b440711f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/18/business/18chinazoom/18chinazoom-facebookJumbo.jpg,The federal case is a fresh black eye for a company that has seen demand for its services skyrocket during the pandemic.,ea0bb48f-bd03-56c3-b759-44b7b440711f,N24News/imgs/ea0bb48f-bd03-56c3-b759-44b7b440711f.jpg,20

On Wednesday, the Trump administration said it would ban the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes after almost 500 cases of vaping-related respiratory illnesses were reported this summer.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump referred to Mr. Bolton as a ""tough guy; so tough, he got us into Iraq."" But he said that despite their disagreements, he wished Mr. Bolton well.

""Sounds like a real dope. Who hired that guy? I mean, whoever did that must be an idiot."" -- JIMMY KIMMEL ""If you knew all that, then why did you hire him in the first place?

Food,"By Praising Trump, Goya President Angers His Core Latino Market",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/10/dining/goya-foods-trump.html,"When Lina Baez-Rosario moved to the United States as a young girl, she missed her home in the Dominican Republic. Her parents made sure to cook with familiar flavors, to keep memories alive. As an adult, the 42-year-old special education kindergarten teacher, who lives in the Inwood area of Manhattan, found those same tastes through the same Goya Foods products. ""Goya is the one product that I know that my family used, that my mom still uses,"" Ms. Baez-Rosario said, ""because it's the one that resembles home to them."" On Thursday, though, she decided she would not be buying Goya products again after the company's president, Robert Unanue, praised President Trump during a visit to the White House.

Mr. Unanue compared the president to his grandfather, an immigrant from Spain who founded the food company in 1936. ""We're all truly blessed at the same time to have a leader like President Trump,"" Mr. Unanue said. After Mr. Unanue's comments, consumers have been dumping out ingredients and calling for a boycott on social media with the hashtags #BoycottGoya, #GoyaFoods and #Goyaway. Prominent Latino politicians like Julian Castro, the former presidential candidate and secretary of housing and urban development, and Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighed in as well.

""If we are the main source of income, if you are targeting us and you are marketing toward us, then your responsibility is to every Latino person, at least in the United States,"" Ms. Baez-Rosario said. In an era of activist shopping, when consumers are ever more vocal about tying their purchasing power to their politics, Mr. Unanue's comments run the risk of alienating his company's core market.

""There are people out there that say they support the immigrant community, but at the end, money is stronger,"" said Gonzalo Guzman, 38, the head chef and a partner at Nopalito, a Mexican restaurant in San Francisco. ""At the end, it's always that. It's always money."" A Goya representative did not reply to specific questions about the controversy. But in a news release, the company pointed out that it has donated 1 million cans of chickpeas and 1 million pounds of other products to food banks across the nation. ""We are committed to our country and the need to give back because it is the right thing to do,"" said Mr. Unanue in the release. Goya is the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the United States, and millions of Latinos have grown up with Goya beans and spice blends, tasting their childhoods in the adobo and sazon. But even so, the multibillion-dollar company, headquartered in New Jersey, can seem as corporate and faceless as any multinational food outfit. ""It's really not a for-us by-us product,"" said Yadira Garcia, 36, a founder and the executive chef of Happy Healthy Latina, which uses culturally relevant cooking and gardening to help underserved communities eat healthier. ""It's just marketed to us like it is."" ""You can't just tell a part of our story and exalt a part of our story, and also profit off our pain and our joys, but not really truly be inclusive in our community,"" Ms. Garcia continued, before criticizing the company's leadership for a lack of diversity. ""You can take our money, but we don't have a seat at their table."" Mr. Unanue visited the White House on Thursday to celebrate the president's signing of an executive order intending to improve Hispanic Americans' access to educational and economic opportunities. And on Friday, Mr. Unanue stood by his words during an appearance on the television program ""Fox & Friends.""

""I'm not apologizing for saying -- and especially when you're called by the president of the United States -- you're going to say, 'No, I'm sorry, I'm busy. No thank you'?"" he said. ""I didn't say that to the Obamas, and I didn't say that to President Trump."" On Friday evening, President Trump tweeted his support of Goya, after a day of #BuyGoya tweets from his supporters fighting back against the boycott.

The prominent chef Jose Andres said that Mr. Unanue could have met with the president and taken a more moderate tone, instead of sparking the all-out social media war that has raged since Thursday afternoon. ""You can go and say: 'Thank you for supporting the Latino community,'"" Mr. Andres said in an interview. ""But then to go and say you are a great leader? A great leader for whom?"" Mr. Andres said he respects the Unanue family, and has worked with them in Puerto Rico in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, but called the praise of President Trump ""over the top."" ""Really? Four months before elections? When he wants to send 1 million DACA children back to their countries?"" said Mr. Andres, referring to the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. ""When he is caging children? When he is allowing militias to patrol the border?""","Robert Unanue said the country was ""blessed"" to have the president's leadership. Now, amid calls for a boycott, the largest Hispanic-owned food company in the U.S. is facing dismay from chefs and home cooks.",dab5745f-2477-56bb-8b62-0cb581554f35,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/13/dining/10JPgoya-chefs-print/10goya2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f012558885abfe9cdf288c6b5eccc5f221c3ebb010f91dea395d17bd8bb75825&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Unanue, the president of Goya Foods, praised President Trump at the White House on Thursday.",dab5745f-2477-56bb-8b62-0cb581554f35,N24News/imgs/dab5745f-2477-56bb-8b62-0cb581554f35.jpg,17
Your Money,6 Tips for Avoiding the Worst Student Loan Repayment Traps,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/20/your-money/6-tips-for-avoiding-the-worst-student-loan-repayment-traps.html,"Whether or not you believe the allegations, the jaw-dropping dossier of sins that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accuses the nation's largest student loan servicer of committing is useful for two crucial reasons. First, it's a reminder of just how much can go wrong when we force inexperienced young adults, especially, to navigate a complex financial services offering. We shouldn't be surprised, but we should be ashamed: Elected representatives cut support for higher education; sticker prices rose; teenagers and others applied for admission, signed up for debt and, in many cases, finished their degrees. Then came the bombardment of confusing loan and repayment options. Nobody stitched this crazy quilt on purpose, but most clear-thinking humans who approach the system for the first time conclude that we are insane for allowing it to evolve this way. Second, the bureau's complaint offers a road map of sorts. For every major infraction that it accuses Navient, the servicer in question, of committing, there is at least one defensive move that borrowers can make to sniff out problems or keep them from happening in the first place.

Let's take them in order: KNOW YOUR LOANS Staying out of trouble with a student loan servicer starts with two questions: How much do you owe, and to whom? Answering those questions is confusing to newcomers for a couple of reasons. First, the servicer of the loan -- the entity that collects payments and takes requests for any adjustments -- is often not the original lender. You can usually answer both questions at once for federal loans (those that come from the Education Department) through the National Student Loan Data System, where you'll need to set up an online account. Sorting out your private loans (those that come from banks and other similar entities) can be harder. Check copies of your credit report from the three major credit bureaus via annualcreditreport.com if you think you may have lost track of a loan, as lenders will almost always report the existence of the loan to the bureaus. INCOME-DRIVEN PAYMENTS If you've got federal loans, you may be eligible for a payment plan that allows you to submit information on your income and family size and then reduce monthly payments to amounts that are affordable. Sometimes you don't have to make any payments at all. Not everyone knows that these programs exist. Savvy lawyers with big loans often do, but plenty of destitute people do not. And, the consumer bureau argues, Navient didn't do a good enough job of explaining to borrowers that they might be eligible.

So all borrowers ought to educate themselves on the topic, just in case. And parents may want to check in with their college seniors and recent graduates, too. The Education Department's repayment estimator tool can tell you whether you're eligible. Elsewhere on the department's website is a list of all the income-driven plans and some frequently asked questions. You'll need your loan servicer's cooperation to enroll in an income-driven plan, and you may have questions for that servicer before you start. Here, Rohit Chopra offers a true pro tip: Don't call. Instead, send your questions through your servicer's messaging system. ""This gives you a paper trail,"" said Mr. Chopra, who was the student loan ombudsman for the consumer agency before leaving for the Education Department and, later, the Consumer Federation of America, where he is now a senior fellow. Servicers often evaluate call center employees by how quickly they can get borrowers off the phone. When customers send messages, however, they often get standardized responses that are accurate because someone senior has vetted them. STAY ENROLLED Signing up for an income-driven plan isn't enough. You have to requalify each year with updated financial information, and the consumer bureau accused Navient of not properly informing borrowers of this fact or of the deadlines. As a result, many borrowers saw their payments jump, leading to budget chaos and a cascade of late payments and additional interest.

Don't count on your servicer to inform you in large capital letters that THIS DEADLINE WILL COME EVERY YEAR. And don't count on yourself to remember, either. Put it on your calendar for the month before your deadline and the week before your deadline, and on your spouse's calendar, too, if you're married. Tim Ranzetta, a financial literacy educator and advocate who once ran a business analyzing student lending data, also suggests using the FutureMe site to send yourself reminder emails that will arrive on the right days. Yes, this should all be automated. There is bipartisan support for making it more so. So cross your fingers, but set up a flurry of redundant reminders in the meantime.

NO FORBEARANCE (IF POSSIBLE) If you run into trouble repaying your loan and you call your servicer to beg for help, it may offer you something called forbearance, which allows you to reduce or eliminate payments for a period of time. The interest, however, keeps adding up. The consumer agency charged Navient with steering borrowers into forbearance when they may have had other, better options, including income-driven repayment plans. Why would it do that? Mr. Ranzetta believes that it may have something to do with how lenders pay servicers and whether the right incentives were in place to give the very best advice. He blogged about it in 2009 and 2010. The bureau, which also nodded to that possibility in its complaint -- and noted how much more time it can take to service borrowers who need hand-holding for income-driven repayment plans -- believes that Navient may have cost consumers up to $4 billion in interest after putting people in multiple consecutive forbearances. In a statement on its website, Navient said that it collects 60 percent less in compensation for borrowers it services who are in forbearance. It also disputed many other aspects of the bureau's complaint. If you have a private loan, your servicer probably doesn't have any income-driven plans. But there still may be other options short of forbearance, like extending the term of a loan to lower payments. Here again, Mr. Chopra believes that you'll have more success getting a list of all available possibilities if you make your inquiry in writing. Back when he was still at the consumer bureau, he posted a sample letter on its site for consumers to use. DROPPING A CO-SIGNER Perhaps you had an older, more creditworthy relative co-sign your loan to qualify for a lower interest rate. And maybe you're earning more as you get older, so you want to release that person from the legal obligation of repaying the loan if you can't do it yourself. Servicers will often allow this if you make on-time payments for a certain number of consecutive months. But, according to the consumer agency, Navient punished borrowers who had prepaid their loans and then skipped payments in subsequent months (with the company's permission) by resetting the clock to zero on their consecutive monthly payment count. ""It's appalling,"" said Lauren Asher, president of the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success.

This gets to a larger, pervasive challenge that exists across lending land: How can you be absolutely sure that a bank or a servicer is crediting your payments exactly as you intend? Mr. Chopra suggests using the servicer's own online interface, preferably with auto-debit if you're sure you won't bounce payments for lack of bank funds. That way, you can set things as you wish, check that it's working for a few months and not have to write checks or push buttons in later months. You may get an interest rate discount for using auto-debit, too. Don't use your bank's bill pay system, Mr. Chopra added, since the servicer may ignore any instructions you write on the check or in an attached memo. And if you just send a check through the mail yourself with nothing else in the envelope, beware. He said that in some big processing facilities, envelopes end up on conveyors that weigh them. If they sense there is nothing inside but a check, the envelope may undergo automatic processing where your instructions will be, you guessed it, ignored. CHECK YOUR CREDIT (AGAIN) You can get a free copy of your credit report each year from the three major credit bureaus. One way to check up on your servicer is to grab a report every four months and then look for any late payments or other signs that things are amiss. The consumer bureau also accused Navient of potentially tarnishing the credit of disabled veterans and others who had received legal discharges of their loans. If this all feels like yet another multi-item checklist for your checklist of multi-item checklists from all over your financial life, well, it is. I'm sorry. And the financial services industry isn't, for the most part. Any of the consumer bureau's complaints sound familiar? If so, file a complaint with the bureau. Do it while you still can, since there's a chance that our newly empowered elected officials will attempt to fire the bureau's director, or strip the bureau of its power at the very least. ""This is a reminder why it is so important that there is an independent consumer watchdog in Washington,"" Ms. Asher said.","The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau accused Navient, the nation's largest student loan servicer, of much wrongdoing.

Opinion,"What the Country Needs, on DACA and So Much More",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/opinion/supreme-court-daca.html,"My parents and I struggled daily to balance the weighty risk of deportation against our need for food, clothing and medical care -- so much so that my mother was ill for nearly a year before we dared to have her see a real doctor, and then only because I found her rolling in bed, incoherent from pain. Just the act of walking through school doors demanded faith in government. As someone who lived in this country as an undocumented child, I have the fear of deportation etched in my bones. Even to this day, the most terrifying act is revealing my illegal history.

When they submitted their DACA applications, the 700,000 recipients made the courageous, conscious decision to hang their lives on the good word of our government. But shortly after taking office, President Trump rescinded Mr. Obama's policy. Impervious to the Dreamers' substantial reliance on DACA, Mr. Trump and his administration allowed just a six month grace period before protections were to end.

Arguing before the Supreme Court, the solicitor general claimed that the president was entitled to execute that abrupt about-face. What's more, he claimed that the executive decision could not be reviewed by any court. And, as any lawyer would, the solicitor general was quick to point out that the claim about President Trump's expansive executive powers (as opposed to President Obama's limited ones) was confined to immigration law alone.

Our nation's history shows that immigration law is a political litmus test. But for Thursday's decision, undocumented immigrants would have been the latest to suffer from our national instability, though they would have been far from the last. Perhaps in the face of the truths our nation has been forced to reckon with in the past few weeks, our highest court has refused to allow our executive branch to perform its about-face without an adequate accounting of the significant reliance placed on the law not just by the Dreamers but also by the citizens who love them, employ them and rely on them.

Before we left China, my parents and I were at the whim of our government -- sacrificial pawns in our leaders' games of political chess. For all his emphatic, continuing denunciations of the Chinese government, President Trump has spent a great deal of his presidency emulating its practices. His reactions to the recent Black Lives Matter protests have eerie parallels to the Chinese government's reactions to the civil unrest in Hong Kong.","Dreamers, and all Americans, deserve more stability than they are getting under Donald Trump.",d597cdd8-5fba-5298-aa06-16289fe3b121,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/18/opinion/18wangWeb/18wangWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7f2266c4d8c2176c642ac7b5cc350d56191107b162171a5a4bc74b92dc23a92b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Demonstrators gathered at the Capitol in 2018 in support of so-called Dreamers.,d597cdd8-5fba-5298-aa06-16289fe3b121,N24News/imgs/d597cdd8-5fba-5298-aa06-16289fe3b121.jpg,11
Theater,"Review: 'Tin Cat Shoes,' a Commentary on the Silliness of the System",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/theater/tin-cat-shoes-review.html,"To your cherished list of warm-weather city pleasures -- handmade Italian ices, sidewalk breezes on bare limbs, dumb movies in air-conditioned theaters -- you should think about adding Summerworks. Now 23 years old, this staple of the East Village culturescape, which has initiated its latest season with a mind-frisking comedy called ""Tin Cat Shoes,"" provides entertainment that feels custom-made for a ""school's out"" state of mind.

For starters, its ticket prices are cheap ($25). But the shows it puts on, under the banner of Clubbed Thumb productions, always look inventively stylish, rather like the luminous young things of the neighborhood who assemble thrift-shop rags into passable imitations of couture. The casts regularly include quirky familiar faces you just know you've seen before, whether on Broadway or ""Law & Order.""

As for those of you who like to imagine you're at the vanguard of all things artistic, Summerworks allows you to say you knew certain rising playwrights before your friends did. Samuel D. Hunter (""The Whale""), Clare Barron (the current ""Dance Nation""), Anne Washburn (""Mr. Burns"") and Sarah DeLappe (""The Wolves"") have all worked with Clubbed Thumb.

But if you just want to chill out with a buzz on, Summerworks is good for that, too. Its productions are usually short and intermission-free, and it specializes in funny, agreeably unhinged shows that often don't make a lot of sense until you think about them afterward. Watching these productions, you are advised to drift with the bubbly flow as you wonder what on earth was in that drink you had earlier.","This initial, mind-frisking comedy from Clubbed Thumb's Summerworks festival is a reminder of the particular pleasures of warm-weather goofiness.",09623be7-c2dd-5334-87bb-5d5d987a99a8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/23/arts/23tincatshoes/23tincatshoes-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f516cf803b2c9139542b5abb5967bd474bb6aa8f2a4ae0e951d7d0e21a104a27&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, foreground, Emily Cass McDonnell, Donnetta Lavinia Grays and Pete Simpson, with Kyle Beltran, top center, as shoe-store employees (on a company outing) in ""Tin Cat Shoes"" at the Wild Project.",09623be7-c2dd-5334-87bb-5d5d987a99a8,N24News/imgs/09623be7-c2dd-5334-87bb-5d5d987a99a8.jpg,10
Sports,Australia and New Zealand Will Host 2023 Women's World Cup,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/sports/soccer/womens-world-cup-2023.html,"Australia and New Zealand will serve as co-hosts for the 2023 Women's World Cup, FIFA announced Thursday, sending one of its two biggest tournaments -- and its first 32-team women's championship -- to two nations that have embraced the women's game. FIFA, world soccer's governing body, announced its decision after its governing council held a vote by videoconference. It also announced that the council had approved $1 billion in investment in women's soccer over the next four years, funding that could prove vital in developing enough competitive national teams to fill the 32-team field. ""We've been given a treasure,"" said Johanna Wood, a member of the FIFA Council from New Zealand, who recused herself from the vote. ""We will look after the treasure and work toward making women's football more front and center on the world stage.""

FIFA's president, Gianni Infantino, said he was surprised by bloc votes in the bidding process. He said that the technical reports must have an impact on the final decision taken by voters, and that he had based his own vote on their conclusions. Infantino also suggested the decision on future hosts would be taken out of the hands of the council and decided by FIFA's member associations at its annual congress, a change that has already occurred for the choice of the host of the men's World Cup. ""There's no reason to treat men and women differently,"" Infantino said. The joint bid from Australia and New Zealand, the first from two countries from two separate confederations, had been considered the leading contender to land the tournament for months. Several other contenders had dropped out earlier in the process. By Thursday, its only remaining competition was a bid from Colombia. The winning plan proposed using 13 stadiums in 12 cities -- seven in Australia and five in New Zealand. Two of the stadiums would be in Sydney, including the 70,000-seat facility built for the 2000 Summer Olympics.

Australia and New Zealand will be looking to benefit from home-field advantage. The Matildas, as Australia's team is known, have competed in every Women's World Cup since 1995, and the team features perhaps the world's best player in Chelsea striker Sam Kerr. But Australia has never advanced past the quarterfinals in the World Cup, and exited at France 2019 -- despite high hopes -- after losing a penalty-kick shootout to Norway in the round of 16.

New Zealand has also become a fixture in the World Cup, with four consecutive appearances. The Football Ferns are the dominant power in their FIFA confederation, and have players competing in some of the world's best professional leagues. But New Zealand's isolation and the scattering of its top players to other parts of the globe have kept it from rising into women's soccer's top tier. FIFA evaluators had rated the Australia-New Zealand bid the highest, noting not only the infrastructure the countries have in place, but also that the bid would ""present the most commercially favorable proposition,"" which is important in any FIFA discussion. Colombia's bid would require significant infrastructure investment, those same evaluators warned, and ""it is not clear if this level of investment will be available."" Colombia and South American soccer's regional governing body lodged a complaint about the technical assessment, saying it had ""erroneous and discriminatory conclusions."" Initially, the winners had expected to face a much bigger field. FIFA, flush with the success of last year's Women's World Cup in France, which was won by the United States, announced last August that a record 10 federations had expressed interest in hosting the 2023 event. One had done so accidentally, it turned out, and several others eventually decided not to submit formal bids.

Only three bids, in fact, advanced to the evaluation phase, and Japan's announcement on Monday that it was withdrawing, after scoring higher than Colombia in the evaluations, made FIFA's decision that much easier. Still, the heightened interest in even considering hosting was encouraging for FIFA. After seeing more than 1.1 million fans attend the most recent edition in France, Infantino needed less than a month to gather the support he needed to expand the event to 32 teams from 24 in time for 2023. As recently as 2011, the field was half as large, with 16 teams. Infantino said FIFA would study the possibility of turning the Women's World Cup into a biennial event rather than stage it every four years, as is customary. Such a move, he said, would boost interest in the women's game but also expand the number of hosts, and allow FIFA to take it to places where it has not been, like South America and Africa. While FIFA often picks the men's World Cup host at least one cycle in advance -- the next host country, Qatar, in 2022, will have had a dozen years to prepare -- it emerged from last year's women's championship with more enthusiasm than concrete plans. Countries were eventually given until Sept. 2 to confirm their intention to bid. Completed bid books had to be submitted by Dec. 13, narrowing the field further, and FIFA then conducted official inspections early this year. The pandemic delayed a vote scheduled for May until Thursday. That means the winners will have just over three years to prepare.","The joint hosting arrangement would be the first for women's soccer's biggest championship, which will expand to 32 teams for the event.",2b9dce3b-625b-51af-8a3e-f404001bfb92,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/sports/25worldcup3/25worldcup3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2996247b0ddb01526330aa7144e3505b35ce8dd3193bb293ecf0eac73eaeb5fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The careful spacing at Australia's socially distant watch party collapsed as soon as the decision was announced.,2b9dce3b-625b-51af-8a3e-f404001bfb92,N24News/imgs/2b9dce3b-625b-51af-8a3e-f404001bfb92.jpg,9
Dance,"Review: David Byrne and Color Guard Blend Dance, Music and Athleticism",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/29/arts/dance/review-david-byrne-and-color-guard-blend-dance-music-and-athleticism.html,"There were also perplexing storytelling numbers. The team Field of View, from West Chester, Pa., and St. Vincent collaborated on ""Lunatic,"" which was set in a mental hospital. The performers stumbled around, amid saber tosses, trying to look deranged. Mechanicsburg Area Senior High School, from Pennsylvania, and the singer-songwriter How to Dress Well presented ""Every 40 Seconds,"" a reference -- as ropes and disappearing performers indicated -- to child abduction. Social commentary is part of contemporary color guard, but these numbers were deflating for all the wrong reasons. What was the original music? Would it have made for a better fit?

Despite the unevenness, the program couldn't suppress the team spirit, where emotional dancing is the norm and bent knees are forgiven. Through interviews, Ira Glass and Nico Muhly, in a collaboration with Alter Ego, from Trumbull, Conn., brought us into the minds of the performers by creating a soundtrack of their inner dialogue while they executed moves. (Mr. Glass used the same tactic in a production with the choreographer Monica Bill Barnes; it worked well then and now.)

Art & Design,"'The Sky Is a Great Space,' and It's the Limit for Marisa Merz",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/26/arts/design/the-sky-is-a-great-space-and-its-the-limit-for-marisa-merz.html,"The Met Breuer's fascinating and tenacious survey of the Italian artist Marisa Merz reveals her at 90 to be the queen of Arte Povera, the postwar Italian movement that favored sculptures and installations fashioned from humble, often discarded materials. And she's nobody's consort. ""Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space"" explores a 50-year career, belatedly lifting Ms. Merz from the edges of this all-male trend -- whose advocates did not always include her in its first, reputation-building exhibitions in the late 1960s and early '70s -- to its throne.

The assembled works suggest that Ms. Merz's relationship to Arte Povera is similar to the American painter Lee Krasner's connection to Abstract Expressionism. They were both marginalized for being women, a condition intensified by being married to one of the movement's most prominent members. (Ms. Merz's spouse, Mario Merz, who died in 2003, was especially competitive and demanding. She devoted a great deal of time to his career, and he did not reciprocate.)

The difference is that Ms. Merz's work is actually better than her husband's. Krasner, whose achievement includes some great paintings and certainly deserves more attention than it initially received, will always be in Jackson Pollock's shadow, like most other Abstract Expressionists. This exhibition proposes that -- with a few notable exceptions, including Jannis Kounellis and Alighiero Boetti -- Arte Povera may turn out to dwell largely in Ms. Merz's shadow.

Ms. Merz, who continues to work in her Turin studio, has remained truer to the movement's vow of poverty, opting for copper wire, paraffin, scraps of wood and cardboard throughout her career (although she does have a penchant for gold leaf). She seldom resorts to outside fabrication, with its aura of expense, except for the plain iron pedestals that hold many of her small heads of unfired clay. Otherwise, she prefers to keep her hand in, making everything herself. Another boon is her devotion to drawing, which wends through her habitual mixing of mediums, giving this exhibition a sense of fullness and intimacy that few in her cohort can muster. The show looks great, the first completely confident effort in the Marcel Breuer landmark since the Met took it over from the Whitney Museum barely a year ago. On view are more than 100 works, including a few often-delicate installation pieces that represent the large sprawling ones (mostly lost) that dominated the early years of her career.

The exhibition was initiated by Connie Butler and the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles, where she is chief curator, and organized jointly with the Met and Ian Alteveer, its curator in the department of modern and contemporary art. It reveals an artist unafraid of incorporating crafts into her work and unintimidated either by scale or personal emotion.

The show opens with a series of immense hanging sculptures made in 1966 in her Turin kitchen (soon to overtake the family's apartment). They are fashioned from thin sheets of shiny aluminum that she more or less treats as fabric, cutting them into fringelike strips, arranging them in poufs, flounces or swags that can suggest fancy ball gowns hung up for the night, while also conjuring automobiles and assembly lines. Some are spray painted with green and red flowers that evoke Andy Warhol. The most impressive is a large piece hugging the ceiling like a heavy silver cloud, dangling immense blooms and stamen in a startling synthesis (to American eyes) of John Chamberlain, Lynda Benglis and Dale Chihuly.

The domestic-industrial duality continues on a smaller scale in the exhibition's largest gallery, where many pieces, dating from late 1960s and 1970s, incorporate little squares and triangles Ms. Merz knitted from copper wire. Delicate and gleaming, these are nailed to walls, evoking boxy little stars, or to found objects (an ancient door, a stool) forming quilt-like patterns and padding. Small sculptures knitted from either wire or nylon thread resemble primitive slippers, bowls or toy boats that might have been excavated from an archaeological site. Ms. Merz also made ""Bea,"" knitting her daughter's name in soft, cloudlike letters that have a touching vulnerability, their knitting needles still attached.

By the late 1970s, Ms. Merz was turning more and more to the female face in paintings, drawings and many of the small heads of unfired clay. But the wire is a continuing presence, an undercurrent of refinement but also protection. Sometimes it stretches across paintings like rays of light. And many of the smaller drawings have filigree patterns that almost seem knitted. Some sculpted heads, and even a few paintings, wear squares of knitted wire that could be a veil or armor befitting Joan of Arc, while others are often exquisitely blushed with layers of pastel, paint and paraffin. These faces often tilt upward as if seeking a higher spirit. Several grouped on a large plane of paraffin might almost be mourners at the base of the cross. It is in the two-dimensional works that another of Ms. Merz's strengths emerges: She has no anxiety about showing her influences, and she is known for leaving many works undated, which indicates a striking indifference to the rankings and lineages of art history. She pillages but also suavely synthesizes art's eternal images of women from the Renaissance to Futurism and beyond: from Madonnas, angels and queens to warriors. In the case of several large, especially powerful drawings in graphite, faces seem to emerge from the arches and buttresses of complex Piranesian structures. And there appear to be popular sources, too -- fashion illustration and screen-goddess publicity shots -- for the big dreamy eyes and full lips that compete with the scabrous surfaces. This is most powerfully apparent in a large, square pastel on paper of deep blue dotted with coins, pushpins and layered paraffin: A gorgeous face floats forward as if from a dream. Ms. Merz's women are often beautiful, if not regal, but her mixes of materials and objects always look provisional; the works almost inevitably refuse to look finished. They evince an artist set on exacting what might be characterized as one woman's revenge on the male gaze while refusing to settle on what, physically, beauty in art should be. This tension leaves us with an unforgettable inspiration: Ms. Merz celebrating her gender with a restless, resolute fierceness.","This exhibition at the Met Breuer explores a 50-year career, belatedly lifting Ms. Merz from the fringes of Arte Povera to its throne.",265545d1-1037-5bfb-847f-340883a02549,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/27/arts/27MERZ1/27MERZ1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=70badeae4c1c11a6c2a94af280676d184f2c32cc727f46fcafb3112896ea81b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Two untitled sculptures and a 1984 painting by Marisa Merz on view at the Met Breuer in the exhibition ""Marisa Merz: The Sky Is a Great Space.""",265545d1-1037-5bfb-847f-340883a02549,N24News/imgs/265545d1-1037-5bfb-847f-340883a02549.jpg,14
Theater,The Secret Life of Sven,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/26/theater/frozen-sven-reindeer-broadway.html,"Sven almost didn't make it to Broadway. When Disney decided to adapt its megahit animated film ""Frozen"" for the stage, the creative team seriously considered killing off the reticent reindeer (a fate that did befall the marauding ice monster Marshmallow as well as the menacing pack of wolves). ""We were going to not have Sven in the show,"" said Thomas Schumacher, the president of Disney Theatrical Productions, ""because we were afraid it would just occupy space onstage and be distracting."" But the company invited its longtime puppetry collaborator, Michael Curry (""The Lion King""), to experiment with ways the shaggy creature might be represented onstage. He tested two-performer pantomime before deciding to fashion a full-scale figure that could wordlessly engage with the unfolding plot -- that could act -- when brought to life by a single actor within.

Sven's head is molded out of carbon-fiber composite, his body is shaped foam covered with braided raw silk, and his hooves are rubber-coated foam sculpture mounted around aluminum and stainless-steel orthopedic braces. Underneath, the performer wears a full-body wicking suit, a carbon-fiber head mount held in place by a soft urethane skin, knee and elbow pads, biking gloves, and a mouth guard. Sven is a slightly larger than life eight and a half feet long, and his frame weighs about 14 pounds. There is a screen hidden in the animal's neck, allowing the actor to see, although his field of vision is sharply limited -- so much so that Sven has the de facto right of way onstage. The reindeer's predominant coloring is a tan-like hue called raw sienna, but he also has a bit of pink (to warm him up visually), some red and blue highlights (the colors of the Norwegian flag) and flecks of green (moss). Up close, there are some touches a theatergoer would never see -- hoof carvings, for example, that echo Scandinavian design patterns in the set.

""He is a compromise between the caricature of the animated feature, a real reindeer and what I know would look human in a way,"" Mr. Curry said. ""When you look at his mug, we did some things to the orbits of the eyes and the cheekbones and the mouth that really make the audience relate to the human quality.""

The role was originated by Andrew Pirozzi, an actor who has been dancing (starting with ballet and tap) since he was 4, and who had learned tumbling and hand balancing by studying at a circus school and performing with an acrobatic team. Sven is onstage for about 40 minutes of the show, and the role is physically taxing -- the performer inside is on all fours, essentially planking for up to seven minutes at a time, with 11-inch stilts attached to his hands, and five-inch metal shanks attached to his feet. Sven's head pivots by a linkage system connected to the performer's head and body; the weight of his head is cantilevered away from the performer's neck by a custom orthopedic back brace. A cable connects the performer's right hand to Sven's eyes, to make the animal blink; another connects his left hand to Sven's ears, which generally swing freely but can also be rotated or pulled back to express excitement or happiness. The mouth moves only when another character (Kristoff or Anna) rubs his throat. Mr. Pirozzi was the only Sven during last summer's pre-Broadway run at the Denver Center for the Performing Arts. But once the mechanics of the role became fully clear, Disney decided it was too much for one actor to do eight times a week, so on Broadway Mr. Pirozzi is Sven at six performances , and Adam Jepsen, an actor who was once a competitive gymnast, does the other two. (The goal is that neither actor does it more than once a day.) ""We spend a lot of time in the gym, with stabilizer exercises and shoulder exercises, strengthening really small muscles that I didn't know existed,"" Mr. Jepsen said.

Mr. Curry, who has studied animal anatomy, and Mr. Pirozzi, who simply loves animals, each spent hours watching YouTube videos of migrating reindeer, trying to understand how they move. ""It turns out they're really gangly, just like our guy -- they're not graceful,"" Mr. Curry said. They worked with a movement consultant, Lorenzo Pisoni, to figure out how the animal would behave. Mr. Pirozzi also spent a lot of time lying on the floor with his dog -- Bella, a Great Dane-pit bull mix -- observing how she responded to being addressed, as well as where her gaze went in moments of silence. One more thing: ""I actually trained with my daughters on my back,"" he said. ""I can do all the planking and the lifts, but I needed the agility on stilts, so Disney let me take those home, and my kids knew every time I was rehearsing I could give them a ride. They're 7 and 8, so the perfect ages -- like a little Anna and Elsa.""","How a onetime acrobat and a ""Lion King"" puppet designer brought a speechless reindeer to life in Disney's stage adaptation of ""Frozen"" on Broadway.",647dc077-1e0d-52fb-bed3-3beb9be0dfb7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/24/arts/24sven7/24sven7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6bc805a72759dca56b7fc14037b53c1028aa32ded4d57346c21a6d1d0c028d55&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. Pirozzi, who originated the role of the reticent reindeer in Denver, getting some love from Sven, played here by Mr. Jepsen.

Opinion,'Your Dad's Not Feeling Well',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/opinion/sunday/your-dads-not-feeling-well.html,"I was in Brooklyn on a Zoom meeting in mid-March, when I saw my mom's name come up on my cellphone. ""Your dad's not feeling well,"" she said.

I rushed to our home in the East Village to meet my parents. For the second time in a week, my dad, Jose, was admitted to the hospital. The following day we were told that he had tested positive for Covid-19. My mother, Rosa, was worried that we'd get sick too. So she ripped sheets off his bed, and washed them along with the clothes he had worn.

About two weeks after Dad was admitted, his doctor called and told us that he might not make it past the weekend. I felt the color drain from my face. My mom's knees buckled, and I held her as she sobbed inconsolably. All we could do was wait. I felt so hopeless.","When he got sick with Covid-19, it opened a window for me to get to know him better.",c372219c-264e-5384-950f-5fe8c3700a25,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/06/sunday-review/04exposures-rodriguez-slide-0OFN/04exposures-rodriguez-slide-0OFN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0f4bba64898a755fe8c2e9daea1ae91b690e75b15505cd18c79cd1d366401d95&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jose, the author&rsquo;s father on a facetime call in April.",c372219c-264e-5384-950f-5fe8c3700a25,N24News/imgs/c372219c-264e-5384-950f-5fe8c3700a25.jpg,11

Food,Chefs Struggle Over Whether to Serve Up Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/dining/chefs-politics-immigration.html,"Meredith Coulson is trying to decide whether to hang up a sign declaring that the White Gull Inn in Fish Creek, Wis., is a sanctuary restaurant. Her family's lodge, which opened 121 years ago on the shores of Green Bay, is known for its cherry-stuffed French toast and whitefish boils. She is not sure she wants it to also be known for its politics. Sanctuary restaurants are not like sanctuary cities, which have laws to protect undocumented immigrants. Joining the sanctuary restaurant movement doesn't mean much more than taking a pledge to prohibit harassment based on factors like religion, sexual orientation or immigration status. Although the Mexican members of her staff are legal immigrants, she said, they fear that if they travel home they may be detained -- or worse.

On the other hand, she doesn't want to alienate customers. ""Fairness and equality don't seem like they should be political,"" she said. ""But in the current climate, people who voted for Trump might feel personally attacked."" Like many restaurant owners and chefs, Ms. Coulson is navigating new waters in a country divided. Among other hard-line stands, President Trump has vowed to impose tariffs on Mexican imports, and he has endorsed more aggressive deportation of people unauthorized to be in the United States -- moves that could hurt the kind of food chefs cook, the people they hire to cook it and their bottom line. As a result, many chefs who have never considered mixing politics with business are wondering if now is the time to start.

""I realize I wasn't using my voice as much as I thought I was or maybe as much as I should,"" said Kwame Williams, who, along with his sisters, runs the Jamaican restaurant Vital Dining in Montclair, N.J., and FreeTown Cafe in Newark. Mr. Williams was one of 15 chefs who met this week at Serenbe, a farming and residential community south of Atlanta, as part of the James Beard Foundation's boot camps, which train chefs to shape food policy. Interest in the boot camps has grown since the election. The waiting list has topped 800 for the seminars, which began five years ago and accommodate only 15 chefs at a time. The foundation plans to offer three this year. The boot camps dissect issues, not politicians. ""They have been declared a Trump-free zone, because chefs are not monolithic,"" said Katherine Miller, the group's senior director of food policy advocacy.

Similarly, registration for the National Restaurant Association's public affairs conference in Washington this month is over 500, a record for the industry group, said Sarah Dolan, its media relations director. Politics even seeped into the recent South Beach Wine and Food Festival, five days of cooking and drinking in Miami Beach that some people call ""spring break for chefs."" Organizers staged a tribute dinner for Jose Andres, the Spanish-born chef who has become a charismatic leader of the restaurant industry's battle over immigration. Mr. Andres has been locked in a legal battle with Mr. Trump since the chef pulled out of a deal to open a restaurant in the new Trump International Hotel in Washington, citing disparaging remarks about Mexican immigrants that the president made during his campaign.

For the first time, the South Beach festival held a panel titled ""Politics Do Belong at the Dinner Table,"" in which immigration dominated the discussion. One panelist, the chef and TV personality Andrew Zimmern, said he had received calls from employees in his production company asking if he could hide immigrants in his unused cabin in Minnesota. People are very fearful, he said, and may soon start leaving the country to avoid being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers. ""This is going to hit Americans in their pocketbooks,"" Mr. Zimmern said, ""and start changing the tone of discourse in Washington very, very, very quickly."" Farms and restaurants rely on a substantial number of the estimated eight million unauthorized immigrants working in the United States. The Pew Research Center estimates 12 percent of restaurant workers are undocumented. The Economic Policy Institute puts the figure closer to 16 percent.

As many as 45 percent of restaurant workers in large cities like New York, Chicago and Los Angeles are undocumented, said Saru Jayaraman, the lawyer who helped start Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, the group behind the sanctuary restaurant movement, which offers training for business owners and information for workers on what to do during an immigration raid. Many chefs admit that some of their workers are probably undocumented but have used fake Social Security numbers to get on the payroll. In some states, private businesses of a certain size, including restaurants, are required to use a federal system called E-Verify to check the numbers, but some opt out, preferring to take a chance on a fine. Although there is scant evidence that ICE officers have conducted wholesale raids on restaurants, chefs worry that they might start. A bigger concern, though, is that employees and their families may be scooped up outside work and deported.

Chefs in Northern California have set up a phone tree to warn one another if restaurants start getting raided. Undocumented workers at a popular barbecue restaurant in Chapel Hill, N.C., have stopped driving, relying instead on fellow employees with proper documentation to get them to work. At a well-known restaurant nearby, a chef who asked that his name not be used so he would not become an enforcement target arranged last week to take over guardianship for 13 of his staff members' children in case their parents are deported. Immigration is one issue that unites many chefs on either side of the political divide, said Michel Nischan, a registered Republican who in 2007 helped start Wholesome Wave, which began a program that doubles the value of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits at farmers' markets. He also helped start the Beard Foundation policy boot camps. Jose Andres at a food and wine festival in Miami Beach. ""Frankly, the conservative chefs and the liberal chefs come down on the same place,"" Mr. Nischan said. ""It would be bad for business."" Edward Lee, a chef who owns three restaurants in Louisville, Ky., and Washington, said the issue went beyond business. Younger chefs in particular have grown up with a heightened awareness of civic responsibility. ""You don't really have a choice to be idle or neutral,"" he said. ""To me, politics has always been a means to an end of improving the community we live in, so I use my restaurants as a tool to do just that."" Mr. Lee donates to the local police department and to Christian charities. He supports a program to train young people from disadvantaged neighborhoods to cook, and another that offers services for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender youths. Recently, he bought 100 copies of the book ""Why We March,"" which raises money for Planned Parenthood. He is giving them away at his restaurant 610 Magnolia.

For years, chefs have been hosting fund-raisers, cooking for charities and starting foundations. Mostly, their causes have been connected to food and farming issues. But over time, chefs began inserting themselves more directly into issues of governance, learning enough about the farm bill and nutrition policy to lobby local and national lawmakers. The political role for chefs grew stronger in 2010, when Michelle Obama invited more than 500 to the White House, asking that they lobby Congress to pass a stronger school nutrition bill and adopt a school in their communities in need of better lunches or a garden. Two years later, Tom Colicchio helped start Food Policy Action, the first chef-led political group to attend both national party conventions last year with the aim of making food policy a higher priority for lawmakers. Even chefs wanting nothing to do with politics or policy find themselves having to figure out where they stand on an increasing number of restaurant-related issues, including foie gras, calorie counts and concealed weapons.

Other chefs have decided the best approach is to engage with customers with a differing stance. For Mary Lyski, declaring Double Comfort, her Southern restaurant in Columbus, Ohio, a sanctuary restaurant was no stretch: The restaurant already donates all of its profits to local food pantries. But it was a problem for some customers, including a Trump supporter. ""He felt he was being discriminated against by liberals, and I can't blame him,"" she said. ""Everyone is so vocal and so mad right now."" Through a series of emails, they came to a resolution. He ended his last email, Ms. Lyski said, by asking: ""Will there still be a seat at the table for me? I promise not to wear anything Trump.""","Since the election, many restaurateurs have taken a stand on tough issues, especially immigration. But others are torn.",a055bbcd-9e1f-51f2-9e84-e4867d0c9071,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/15/dining/15Foodpol1/15Foodpol1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9930b80de8d605a34478f6633710e30345beb07c00c95efd94addf7e53efec69&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A group of chefs gather at Serenbe, a farming and residential community south of Atlanta, the James Beard Foundation's Chefs Boot Camp for Policy and Change.",a055bbcd-9e1f-51f2-9e84-e4867d0c9071,N24News/imgs/a055bbcd-9e1f-51f2-9e84-e4867d0c9071.jpg,17
Sports,"After an Overhaul, U.S. Women Shift to Sweating the Small Stuff",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/27/sports/uswnt-japan-shebelieves.html,"CHESTER, Pa. -- Jill Ellis has had three years to tinker. She knew better than anyone how quickly this summer's Women's World Cup would arrive, so Ellis, the United States women's national team coach, started remaking her squad almost as soon as it crashed out of the 2016 Rio Olympics. She tinkered while her star forward signed a contract to play in France for half a season, and she tinkered when her captain signed a similar deal to join a club in England. She tinkered by bringing in new players and by dropping old ones. She tested new formations and tweaked more familiar ones, and engaged in experiments prompted by injuries, player availability and even curiosity. But Ellis said Tuesday that she is done tinkering. The players -- with at least one notable exception -- who are in camp for the three-game She Believes Cup, which they started with a disappointing (at least defensively) 2-2 draw against Japan on Wednesday, will form the core of the group Ellis will take to defend the United States' world championship at the World Cup in France. There are, of course, familiar names -- Alex Morgan, Megan Rapinoe, Julie Ertz, Tobin Heath -- in camp. But fans who haven't followed the team since it won its World Cup title in Canada will soon come to know several new ones, too: Rose Lavelle, Jessica McDonald, Sam Mewis, Tierna Davidson. And for the first time since 2005, the United States will enter a major tournament without Hope Solo in goal.

But 100 days before the World Cup opens -- a milestone that arrived on Wednesday -- Ellis and her players said this week that their biggest questions already had been asked and answered. ""You've kind of built the skeleton,"" Ellis said. ""Now we're working on the nervous system."" The process has not always been pleasant. Lloyd, the star of the 2015 World Cup victory, has been eased into a supporting role, and players like Lindsey Horan and Crystal Dunn -- who were not part of the 2015 team -- have become nearly irreplaceable. Blessed with a wealth of speed and attacking options, Ellis toyed with a three-defender system early in the process to see if a relentless focus on getting forward would enjoy adequate cover if the ball was turned over. Spoiler: It didn't, so she adjusted again. ""I would say that it was uncomfortable,"" defender Becky Sauerbrunn said of working through the evolution in real time. ""And she was very honest with us and was saying she wants it to be uncomfortable."" ""She said she was going to throw people into formations and into games that maybe they weren't prepared for,"" Sauerbrunn added. ""And she wanted to see how they reacted, because in a World Cup you never know what you're going to face, and you're going to have to be able to take those challenges on and still perform well. And so I feel very strong having gone through that process."" The focus now is on polishing partnerships and connections, the ""nervous system"" connecting players on the field that Ellis mentioned Tuesday. Those connections were clearly lacking at times on Wednesday night, particularly in a makeshift back line that was missing the leadership and direction of an absent Sauerbrunn.

""We definitely talk about relationships a lot -- who you're playing with on the sides of the field, who you're playing with in the middle of the field, and your relationships with them,"" Mewis said. ""And the coaches have definitely mentioned to us that not only are they looking at individual players, they're looking at how those players interact with the players around them."" Health issues have complicated some of those decisions. Horan, a fixture in the American midfield, will miss the She Believes Cup with a quad injury. The 20-year-old Davidson (broken ankle) and the 30-year-old Kelley O'Hara (ankle surgery) are still working their way back into top form. One of the players hoping to contend for a place in the midfield with Horan out, Danielle Colaprico, was ruled out herself this week because of a recurrence of a groin injury. Emily Fox, a young defender who had seemingly fallen out of the picture after a poor performance at left back against France in January, replaced Colaprico on the roster -- but there are no guarantees Fox will go to the World Cup. ""The door's not closed for anybody,"" Ellis said, though she acknowledged the time had long passed when she could afford to give a player on the fringes of the team an extended look. ""It's not just giving players time to give them time,"" Ellis added. ""It's making sure we're accomplishing something in that."" The team's next few opponents were chosen for specific challenges: The Americans play a technical team, Japan, on Wednesday, and then face more physical sides in England (Saturday) and Brazil (Tuesday). Ellis said she would not show all her cards in these matches, or the ones that follow, and she did not expect her opponents to reveal themselves, either. ""So for us, then, the focus is on ourselves,"" she said. ""What can we do? And how good can we get?"" In that mind-set, even setbacks, or mistakes, can be instructive, if a team is willing to acknowledge them. ""Any holes will get exposed now,"" Mewis said. ""And we'd rather solve any problems now.""","With 100 days left until the Women's World Cup, the United States says it has solved many of its big questions. But that doesn't mean there won't be more.",802ddaed-3a8e-54b1-b52f-d20cf4ac50e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/28/sports/28ussoccerearly/28ussoccerearly-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=1b4d377902eddccbfeccf32815dc0376acb08c5e7a903cc0541bd3f7c45de2ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julie Ertz, front, and Crystal Dunn during a victory against Spain in January.",802ddaed-3a8e-54b1-b52f-d20cf4ac50e1,N24News/imgs/802ddaed-3a8e-54b1-b52f-d20cf4ac50e1.jpg,9
Sports,Baylor's Handling of Rape Cases Still Follows Ken Starr,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/19/sports/starr-baylor.html,"In August 2015, Ken Starr, then president of Baylor University, issued a bold pronouncement to students and faculty. ""By God's grace,"" he wrote, ""we are living in a golden era at Baylor."" Less than a year later, the university's regents voted to remove Mr. Starr after six years on the job, saying he failed to act as charges of sexual assault upended the football team and swept the nation's largest Baptist university, a place where biblical verse is carved into the sidewalks. Mr. Starr, 73, has held many high-profile national posts, including solicitor general and independent counsel. Now he will work on the legal team defending President Trump in his impeachment trial. But his tenure as president of Baylor and its 14,000 students registers as a dark chapter in his career. Young women and several former officials said in interviews that Mr. Starr ignored the women's cries for help and that he and other top officials at Baylor failed in their responsibility to shield the women from sexual harm. Three years ago, 15 current and former female students filed a lawsuit against Baylor, saying they had been raped or assaulted by fellow students, one of whom was a football player. Their case has unearthed piles of unsightly evidence of official inaction.

""Starr presided over Baylor at a time when hundreds of young women were assaulted and Baylor's policy was indifference at best,"" said Jim Dunnam, who is a Baylor Law School graduate and former leader of the statehouse Democrats and who, as a lawyer for the plaintiffs, has taken testimony under oath from regents and former university officials. Mr. Starr did not respond to messages seeking comment. A prodigious fund-raiser, Mr. Starr focused less on managing the day-to-day operations of the university in Waco, Texas. In ""Bear Country,"" his retrospective book on his time at Baylor, he compared himself to Ronald Reagan, who might come up light on numbers or specifics of a policy but had a firm commitment to first principles. Mr. Starr also described himself as a ""transparency and sunshine guy,"" referring to his belief that problems should be tackled openly, and said he focused on sexual violence from the moment of his arrival on campus in 2010. But Mr. Starr faced many complications in his time at Baylor. The university existed within a hermetic world of denial about sex, according to current and former officials there. Sex outside of marriage and with gay partners was prohibited and cause for expulsion. Drinking, too, was forbidden.

Shortly after his arrival and before trouble erupted with the football team, Mr. Starr hired a consulting firm, Margolis Healy, that specializes in campus security to scrutinize Baylor's handling of sexual assaults, which were occurring at a disturbing rate. He said in an interview with The Texas Tribune that this report found the university was complying with Title IX. And he added that sexual assault was not ""endemic"" to the university. But a copy of this still-confidential report reviewed by The New York Times contradicts Mr. Starr's claims. The often devastating text revealed that Baylor was not complying with the demands of Title IX, the code of the civil rights law that governs education. The Margolis Healy consultants found Baylor officials had ignored federal regulations and heaped Title IX responsibilities on officials who already had full-time jobs. Deans and department chairs and counselors lacked required training in how to handle dating violence, and the report found a single ""overwhelmed"" investigator who could not ""realistically"" comply with federal law. The university's sexual misconduct policy did not define sexual consent and focused instead on the woman's behavior in igniting problems. The Baylor and Waco police neglected to share information and ""underreported sexual assaults."" Administrators, the report stated, resisted addressing ""sex and alcohol in any way."" The report found that Baylor had sidestepped scandal ""based to a certain extent on luck."" Shortly after Mr. Starr received this report, university officials hired the school's first full-time Title IX coordinator, Patty Crawford. In an interview, Ms. Crawford, who worked at Baylor for nearly two years, described a university run like a country store on questions of sexual assault. Regents often interfered with investigations and some faculty sulked when asked to take training.

""When I got there, Baylor, a school older than the state of Texas, did not have a single Title IX file,"" she said. ""There is a group of faculty and administrators who are working very hard to get across that Title IX and diversity initiative are not biblical."" She eventually quit in disgust, but only after she established protocols and tabulated 417 allegations of sexual assault and harassment over several years, 90 percent of which had nothing to do with athletics. ""It was utterly overwhelming,"" she said. ""And football was definitely not the worst."" She said that Mr. Starr was not among those who bridled at a federal role and that he said he wanted the school to comply with laws. But he did not shy from asserting the school's religious injunctions. He emphasized after he left Baylor that the university's prohibitions against premarital and gay sex were ""Orthodox Christian doctrine"" and ""those are our values and we do not apologize."" Baylor is one of many religion-based universities in the United States that navigate such waters, some quite successfully. The practical effect of Baylor's acceptance of federal regulations, however, proved problematic. Three past and present female students who said they were raped by fellow students all describe a story of abandonment by officials during that time. One of these women was a nursing student from small-town Texas come to a handsome Christian campus with grand lawns and overarching oaks. Horror came her way freshman year when, she said, she was raped. She went to a university doctor and told him: I have been assaulted and I need an H.I.V. test. ""He said, 'O.K., let's draw your blood.' He did not ask if I had reported this and asked nothing about it,"" she recalled. She asked a Baylor lawyer if by reporting her assault she risked expulsion for premarital sex. Maybe, she said he advised, you should remain silent and concentrate on your work. A top student, her grades plummeted. She went to her professors and said she was raped and asked for a second chance. She said they replied: ""Nurses need to be professional and you need to keep your personal life separate from your schooling and professional life.""

Finally, after several football players were prosecuted for assaulting fellow students, Mr. Starr decided in 2014 to hire a Philadelphia law firm, Pepper Hamilton, to investigate. This time, though, the move would end in his removal. Once Mr. Starr and the football coach Art Briles were out the door, Baylor's regents ordered that law firm not to write a report of its findings. Mr. Starr publicly disagreed and called on Baylor to release a report and publicly reckon with the sweep of the scandal, even if it reflected harshly on him. ""It was contemplated there would be a report,"" Mr. Starr told The Texas Tribune in a long interview two months after his removal. ""I've been very clear that we need all of the facts."" He argued -- and testimony would later support his view -- that Baylor unduly tarred its football team, though one former player is serving a lengthy sentence. Another had his conviction overturned, a decision being reviewed on appeal. Baylor has acknowledged it had problems in the past, but in an interview in the fall of 2018, Linda Livingstone, Baylor's current president, said her university was reborn after the sexual assault scandals that ended with Mr. Starr's dismissal. ""We are a Christian research institution,"" she said. ""We recognize that there is a lot of work to do to rebuild trust."" In November 2016, after his firing, Mr. Starr sat for an interview with the television station KWTX. Its reporter asked Mr. Starr about an email that a woman who said she was raped had sent to him. It bore the subject line: ""I was raped at Baylor.""","At Baylor, Mr. Starr correctly surmised that the university's sexual assault crisis stretched far beyond the football team. What he did, or did not do, about that cost him his job.",e3b30334-d580-5fae-bc3b-af9c21b1af42,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/19/sports/19starrbaylor2/19starrbaylor2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0666dd23e65a593639ca3ca1b9c61214c8a1a644e61c0399e19fe654004f5235&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ken Starr was Baylor University's president from 2010 to 2016,e3b30334-d580-5fae-bc3b-af9c21b1af42,N24News/imgs/e3b30334-d580-5fae-bc3b-af9c21b1af42.jpg,9
Fashion & Style,Fighting Frizz? Then You Should've Put a Shower Cap on It,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/fashion/straightened-hair-frizz-shower-caps-drybar.html,"Aly Walansky doesn't care how ridiculous she may look.

When she is running errands or heading to meetings and it begins to rain, she will reach into her purse, pull out her shower cap and place it over what she describes as her ""coarse, Jewish Eastern European, curly"" hair.

Ms. Walansky spends about $30 a week on blowouts and $400 a year on treatments that keep her hair sleek and smooth. So, even if it's just really humid out, she will wear a shower cap.

""I'd much rather embarrass whomever I'm with than arrive where I'm going with bad hair,"" said Ms. Walansky, a 35-year-old writer who lives in Brooklyn. ""Blowouts are expensive.""

Hair-straightening processing like keratin treatments and blow-dry salons are highly popular among women with all types of hair, and this is a summer that at least feels even hotter and more humid than usual. So shower caps and other impermeable head coverings that shield follicles from frizz-inducing elements are coming out of the shower, appearing in social-media selfies and sometimes even on the streets.","In an effort to protect their straightened hair, some women are bringing shower caps out of the shower, even wearing them on the street.",7732be81-1a14-5fc7-bf3f-d83dfac63d0a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/18/fashion/18SHOWERCAPS1/18SHOWERCAPS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=1b249b61c2342b9db22f37919416f44347ace7dd11ae310ee116dbf4688201cd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Aly Walansky in her neighborhood of Park Slope, Brooklyn.",7732be81-1a14-5fc7-bf3f-d83dfac63d0a,N24News/imgs/7732be81-1a14-5fc7-bf3f-d83dfac63d0a.jpg,19

Fashion & Style,"Hillary, Me and the Digital Divide",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/fashion/hillary-clinton-personal-technology.html,"On Dec. 23, 2009, Hillary Clinton, who was then secretary of state, sent an email on her private server to her aide Huma Abedin asking how to switch her home phone to fax mode. In the long chain that followed, Ms. Abedin explained, more than once: ""Just pick up phone and hang it up. And leave it hung up."" The former first lady and current presidential candidate is also like a lot of other men and women who were adults when personal computers came into use, and who to this day cannot scan, iChat, use Spotify or hook up their Roku, and would prefer not to let the world -- or their younger colleagues -- in on their tech inadequacy. It's the kind of admission of age-based incompetence best shared with only the closest advisers. That's the number reporters here at The New York Times call when they are having trouble with the paper's secure server; technicians are available 24/7 to help people who can't remember their password, don't understand iCloud or don't know how to get past the locked-key icon that blocks intruders from getting in. I know them by name, and they sigh when they hear mine. Unlike Bernie Sanders, the Trump campaign is not sick and tired of hearing about Mrs. Clinton's emails. Yet oddly, in all the failings hurled at Mrs. Clinton at the Republican National Convention during the past week -- venality, murder and reckless disregard for national security -- there was no mention of her internet ignorance.

Even Donald J. Trump's 22-year-old daughter, Tiffany, didn't try to court her millennial peers by painting her father's opponent as a technoramus. Obviously, internet aversion was not the primary reason Mrs. Clinton had a private server installed in her house in Chappaqua, N.Y., rather than relying on the State Department system. Mrs. Clinton's own emails made it clear she was far more obsessed with shielding herself from prying reporters and Republicans than enemy hackers. When a State Department deputy chief of staff for operations suggested in a 2010 email that she use the government system to avoid spam, she declined, writing, ""I don't want any risk of the personal being accessible."" But it could be that one of the personal secrets she was hiding was her discomfort with the digital revolution. On July 24, 2010, Mrs. Clinton had trouble using her iPad. ""I don't know if I have WIFI,"" she wrote in an email to another close aide. ""How do I find out?""

On Oct. 7, 2012, Mrs. Clinton emailed that aide: ""Do you know what channel on the TV in DC is the program listing? And, specifically, what channel number is Showtime?"" She added, ""Because I want to watch 'Homeland.'"" Mrs. Clinton is not known for excessive humility or self-deprecation, so there is something almost touching about what she wrote in the subject line of the Showtime email: ""stupid question."" And there were signs Mrs. Clinton wanted to improve. She asked her former chief of staff, Cheryl Mills, to lend her a book called ""Send: Why People Email So Badly and How to Do It Better.""

 Nick Merrill, a Clinton spokesman, confirmed that on the road, Mrs. Clinton still uses a BlackBerry, even though the company announced this month that it was discontinuing the classic version with a physical keyboard and trackpad. ""Sometimes it can be very tough to let go,"" Ralph Pini, BlackBerry's chief operating officer, wrote in a company blog post. Mr. Merrill did not allow that his boss might be technologically challenged. He noted that, among other things, she sometimes uses Spotify. Tech consultants are careful not to use the word ""stupid"" when instructing baby boomers. Some even avoid the word ""easy."" Tariq Fayad, 27, a programmer and app designer in New York, said he no longer says a task is easy. ""Because,"" he explained, ""sometimes it's hard to teach."" He said he had learned to keep his instructions simple, especially with his parents. ""I don't tell my dad to swipe,"" he said, ""I say, 'Put your finger on the screen and move it across really quickly.'"" Mr. Fayad gives his relatives free lessons. On the other hand, he is still on the family phone plan in Texas.

Once the server scandal erupted and investigations began, it was tricky for Mrs. Clinton's aides to explain to outsiders what they were up against. Their private emails said it all. ""I talked to Cheryl about this,"" Lewis Lukens, a former high-level State Department official, wrote to a colleague who didn't understand why the secretary of state didn't check her emails on her office computer. ""She says the problem is HRC does not know how to use a computer to do email, only BB."" There are plenty of people who remember hot pants and Nixon's wage and price controls and who clung to their BlackBerries at any cost. Amanda Urban, the renowned literary agent, was so attached to hers that when her company, ICM Partners, stopped supporting the BlackBerry in 2014, she bought a $100 BlackBerry keyboard to fit on her iPhone. She then had to travel with two chargers and extra battery packs. ""My entire handbag was given over to the care and maintenance of my BB,"" Ms. Urban said. ""Frankly, I was relieved when ICM confiscated it -- which is what they did. It was a Monday-morning intervention -- no other way to describe it."" Ms. Urban adjusted to the iPhone, but she still mourns her first device. ""The BB was far superior to do email on, and that is what Hillary has to think, too."" For my personal devices, I rely on Kai Lui, a whiz technology consultant who makes house calls. I called Kai for this article and explained that I sympathized with Mrs. Clinton because when people say I am not tech-savvy, that hurts my feelings. He waited a beat and replied, ""You're tech-savvy enough, Alessandra.""","As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton struggled to fax, send emails from a computer or find Showtime on her television.

Art & Design,On the Hunt for Artistic Gems at Frieze,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/arts/design/review-frieze-new-york.html,"""Shady,"" an outdoor installation by Kapwani Kiwanga, a Paris-based artist and the winner of the Frieze artist award. The installation is on view through Sunday at Frieze New York on Randalls Island.

Art fairs are in the uncomfortable position of being the bane of the art world's existence and among its primary staffs of life. In the face of this contradiction, Frieze New York, on view through Sunday on Randalls Island in an improved tent structure, is arguably the most resourceful. It has lost some of its sheen and a few clients to Tefaf, the Dutch fair now in its second year at the Park Avenue Armory. Frieze's response to Tefaf -- whether by choice or circumstance -- seems to have been to skew younger and a bit squarer.

This year, nearly 40 of Frieze's more than 190 participants are first timers -- a turnover that the fair says is normal. Nonetheless, some of the newcomers are galleries that Frieze would probably not have considered in previous years; but here they are, putting their best feet forward. The result is a fair that feels less groomed, more democratic and global -- something of a relief -- especially in its lively Spotlight section, where dealers have devoted solo shows to neglected postwar artists from around the world. It also has more ups and downs. There's plenty good to look at; you just have to seek it out.

Facing the North entrance, 303 Gallery has orchestrated a scruffy yet white-on-white presentation centering on ""Blind Spot,"" a stack of sparsely graffitied cubes by Eva Rothschild. Tracey Emin has some new paintings at Xavier Hufkens that blend Cy Twombly, Julian Schnabel and Georg Baselitz, but are actually startlingly good. David Zwirner has devoted half his space to a beautiful selection of Josh Smith's paintings of Death in colorful robes suggest something livelier. Gavin Brown's enterprise has a stark presentation of photographs taken or found (and usually manipulated) and then arranged in six big framed gangs by the great filmmaker Arthur Jafa. Presented on a single wall overlooking a noticeably empty gray-surfaced floor, they form a kind of diary and include images of art (van Gogh, Cady Noland), well-known figures (Marilyn Monroe, Martin Luther King Jr.) and terrorist acts. They meditate on contemporary life, but especially black life. Their virtually omnivorous range indicates, as I overheard someone remark, ""a mind on fire.""

Solo shows definitely have the edge this year, although a drawing survey at Canada, selected by the artist Jason Fox, may entice, and a major Bruce Nauman sculpture is great to see at Hauser & Wirth, despite overwhelming the rest of the display. Most of them contain one gem or another. Want to see a new fiery view of nature by the talented painter Shara Hughes? Try Rachel Uffner's booth. A sublime sculpture made mostly of wire, wool and air by the extraordinary Sonia Gomes? Head to Mendes Wood DM. A big found kilim textile embroidered with river-like currents of silver and gold thread by Raqs Media Collective? Follow the money to the Frith Street Gallery.

The new design allows the categories to be more concentrated, which could be more actively exploited. The unity of the Spotlight section, for example, is thrilling. You are surrounded by galleries presenting solos of little-known or underappreciated postwar artists, like a seminar in the flesh. Ryan Lee Gallery is presenting unfamiliar 1960s figurative paintings in saturated color by Emma Amos, which instantly links with Faith Ringgold and Bob Thompson's works from that same era. At Weiss Berlin, four beautiful soft-edged abstractions made since 1980 by Edward Clark. In a compact show at Lyles & King, ""Unseen Dick Paintings (1988-1993),"" demonstrates that the early work of Mira Schor continues to shock. At Partners & Mucciaccia, Carla Accardi's vine-like abstractions from the 1950s lay the groundwork for her Arte Povera installations, while the pale abstractions of Helen Lundberg at Cristin Tierney gallery include one that resembles a variation on Superman's logo. And Jhaveri Contemporary from Mumbai, will introduce you to the luscious semi-abstract figurative paintings of Mohan Samant (1924-2004), whose motifs are sometimes reinforced by delicate bent wires that float above the canvas, resembling drawing in ink. If it's older material that moves you, Donald Ellis's devastating display of North Plains Indian ledger drawings is arguably the fair's best show, and near the Spotlight section.

Frieze, which originated in London, has energetically pursued what seems to be the main art-fair defense, which is to add enough bells and whistles to look as little like an art fair as possible. Maybe even act like a temporary museum. It has an active program of lectures and panels as well as an education program and docents, and great food. This year it inaugurates an Artist Award, sponsored by the Luma Foundation and chosen by a jury from open-call submissions. The winner is Kapwani Kiwanga, a Paris-based artist whose outdoor installation, titled ""Shady,"" is made of large swathes of colored semi-transparent agriculture fabric layered on steel frames. It conjures a confusing set of associations, including barriers, escape routes, makeshift shelters, stage sets and Minimal art. Also new this year is ""Live,"" a series of performances taking place in various booths and spaces. As if this weren't enough, Frieze has established its first themed exhibition, a tribute to Hudson (1950-2014), the visionary art dealer whose gallery, Feature, gave first shows to some of the art world's current best sellers, including Takashi Murakami, Charles Ray and Raymond Pettibon. This is more than a little ironic, since Hudson rarely participated in art fairs. In addition, Feature was one of the great feeder galleries of the late-20th century: The kind of place whose discovery of new talent has long been essential to the operation of the big galleries that are in turn essential to the fairs. And also the kind of place that rising rents -- not to mention art fairs themselves -- threaten to put out of business.

It needs to be said that 190 booths feels too big for Frieze, making it a little too much like the Armory Show. Tefaf by comparison has just over 90 participants. But it is equally worth pointing out that the five separate structures of Frieze's new design have built into them the option to downsize, something that all art fairs should consider.","Frieze New York is skewing younger and a bit squarer.
