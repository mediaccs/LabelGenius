Global Business,Banks Build Contingency for Breakup of the Euro,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/26/business/global/banks-fear-breakup-of-the-euro-zone.html,"PARIS -- For the growing chorus of observers who fear that a breakup of the euro zone might be at hand, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany has a pointed rebuke: It's never going to happen. But some banks are no longer so sure, especially as the sovereign debt crisis threatened to ensnare Germany itself this week, when investors began to question the nation's stature as Europe's main pillar of stability. On Friday, Standard & Poor's downgraded Belgium's credit standing to AA from AA+, saying it might not be able to cut its towering debt load any time soon. Ratings agencies this week cautioned that France could lose its AAA rating if the crisis grew. On Thursday, agencies lowered the ratings of Portugal and Hungary to junk. While European leaders still say there is no need to draw up a Plan B, some of the world's biggest banks, and their supervisors, are doing just that.

""We cannot be, and are not, complacent on this front,"" Andrew Bailey, a regulator at Britain's Financial Services Authority, said this week. ""We must not ignore the prospect of a disorderly departure of some countries from the euro zone,"" he said. Banks including Merrill Lynch, Barclays Capital and Nomura issued a cascade of reports this week examining the likelihood of a breakup of the euro zone. ""The euro zone financial crisis has entered a far more dangerous phase,"" analysts at Nomura wrote on Friday. Unless the European Central Bank steps in to help where politicians have failed, ""a euro breakup now appears probable rather than possible,"" the bank said. Major British financial institutions, like the Royal Bank of Scotland, are drawing up contingency plans in case the unthinkable veers toward reality, bank supervisors said Thursday. United States regulators have been pushing American banks like Citigroup and others to reduce their exposure to the euro zone. In Asia, authorities in Hong Kong have stepped up their monitoring of the international exposure of foreign and local banks in light of the European crisis. But banks in big euro zone countries that have only recently been infected by the crisis do not seem to be nearly as flustered. Banks in France and Italy in particular are not creating backup plans, bankers say, for the simple reason that they have concluded it is impossible for the euro to break up. Although banks like BNP Paribas, Societe Generale, UniCredit and others recently dumped tens of billions of euros worth of European sovereign debt, the thinking is that there is little reason to do more.

""While in the United States there is clearly a view that Europe can break up, here, we believe Europe must remain as it is,"" said one French banker, summing up the thinking at French banks. ""So no one is saying, 'We need a fallback,' "" said the banker, who was not authorized to speak publicly. When Intesa Sanpaolo, Italy's second-largest bank, evaluated different situations in preparation for its 2011-13 strategic plan last March, none were based on the possible breakup of the euro, and ""even though the situation has evolved, we haven't revised our scenario to take that into consideration,"" said Andrea Beltratti, chairman of the bank's management board. Mr. Beltratti said that banks would be the first bellwether of trouble in the case of growing jitters about the euro, and that Intesa Sanpaolo had been ""very careful"" from the point of view of liquidity and capital. In late spring, the bank raised its capital by five billion euros, one of the largest increases in Europe. Mr. Beltratti said that Italy, like the European Union, could adopt a series of policy measures that could keep the breakup of the euro at bay. ""I certainly felt more confident a few months ago, but still feel optimistic,"" he said. European leaders this week said they were more determined than ever to keep the single currency alive -- especially with major elections looming in France next year and in Germany in 2013. If anything, Mrs. Merkel said she would redouble her efforts to push the union toward greater fiscal and political unity. That task is seen as slightly easier now that the crisis has evicted weak leaders from troubled euro zone countries like Italy and Spain. But it remained an uphill battle as Mrs. Merkel continued this week to oppose the creation of bonds that would be backed by the euro zone. Politically, even the idea of a breakaway Greece is increasingly considered anathema. Despite expectations that Greece -- and the banks that lent to it -- may receive European taxpayer bailouts for up to nine years, officials fear its exit could open a Pandora's box of horrors, such as a second Lehman-like event, or even the exit of other countries from the euro union.

Europe's common currency union was formed more than a decade ago and now includes 17 European Union members, creating a powerful economic bloc aimed at cementing stability on the Continent. It ushered in years of prosperity for its members, especially Germany, as interest rates declined and money flooded into the union -- until the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy sent global credit markets into chaos three years ago and the financial crisis took on new life with the near-default of Greece last year. The creation of the euro zone meant countless interlocking contracts and assets among the countries, but no mechanism for a country to leave the union. But as the crisis leaps to Europe's wealthier north, banks have been increasing their preparedness for any outcome. For instance, while it would certainly be legally, financially and politically complicated for Greece to quit the euro zone, some banks are nonetheless tallying how euros would be converted to drachmas, how contracts would be executed and whether the event would cause credit markets to seize up worldwide. The Royal Bank of Scotland is one of many banks testing its capacity to deal with a euro breakup. ""We do lots of stress-test analyses of what happens if the euro breaks apart or if certain things happen, countries expelled from the euro,"" said Bruce van Saun, RBS's group finance director. But, he added: ""I don't want to make it more dramatic than it is."" Certain businesses are taking similar precautions. The giant German tourism operator TUI recently caused a stir in Greece when it sent letters to Greek hoteliers demanding that contracts be renegotiated in drachmas to protect against losses if Greece were to exit the euro. TUI took the action just days after Mrs. Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France acknowledged at a meeting earlier this month of G-20 leaders in Cannes, France, that Greece could well leave the monetary union. On Thursday, Greece's central bank warned that if the country failed to improve its finances quickly, the question would become ""whether the country is to remain within the euro area."" In a survey published Wednesday of nearly 1,000 of its clients, Barclays Capital said nearly half expected at least one country to leave the euro zone; 35 percent expect the breakup to be limited to Greece, and one in 20 expect all countries on Europe's periphery to exit next year. Some banks are now looking well beyond just one country. On Friday, Merrill Lynch became the latest to issue a report exploring what would happen if countries were to exit the euro and revert to their old currencies. If Spain, Italy, Portugal and France were to start printing their old money again today, their currencies would most likely weaken against the dollar, reflecting the relative weakness of their economies, Merrill Lynch calculated.",European leaders say there's no reason to prepare for the unthinkable: the breakup of the euro zone. But some big banks are no longer so sure.,2dcbd113-69c9-5008-9dfa-2ab42556146a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/26/business/Euro/Euro-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=350&w=600&s=cda060a18300f34122678bca60f0d86d7e1cd57cd8c700eeca8d02e8577c725d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and the nation's finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble.",2dcbd113-69c9-5008-9dfa-2ab42556146a,N24News/imgs/2dcbd113-69c9-5008-9dfa-2ab42556146a.jpg,24
Movies,"As Hollywood Embraces Diversity, Jobs for Female Directors Remain Sparse",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/14/movies/hollywood-female-directors.html,"Two weeks ago, the big movie studios showcased their 2019 lineups for multiplex executives in a series of elaborate marketing presentations in Las Vegas. It's an annual ritual: Here are the potential hits we will deliver. For the first time, the importance of onscreen diversity came across as more than lip service. Paramount presented a family adventure (""Dora the Lost City of Gold"") with a predominantly Latino cast, while Warner Bros. promoted a ""Shaft"" sequel starring Samuel L. Jackson and Regina Hall. Universal touted a comedy starring black women (""Little""), an animated movie about a Chinese girl's quest (""Abominable"") and a summer musical (""Yesterday"") with an actor of Indian descent playing the lead. But look a little closer at the movies on studio rosters -- and who is directing them -- and Hollywood's inclusion narrative falls apart by one crucial measure. Even after years of being called to task for sidelining female filmmakers, studios as a whole continue to rely overwhelmingly on men to lead productions. Studios have multiple explanations (some would say excuses), but one big reason involves a lack of economic pressure. Moviegoers have been responding favorably to diverse casting and stories (""Us,"" ""Crazy Rich Asians,"" ""Black Panther""), prompting studios to serve up more. Fewer ticket-buying decisions are made based on the gender of the filmmaker, however.

That most studios employ few female directors would not surprise anyone who has been paying attention to the research from academics like Stacy L. Smith at the University of Southern California. But most reports on Hollywood hiring offer a rearview portrait; compiling comprehensive data requires a lag. So the of-the-moment snapshot provided by the recent studio presentations is striking. During its session on April 3 at CinemaCon, a convention staged by the National Association of Theater Owners, Disney unveiled a 19-film slate for the rest of 2019, including a batch of movies from the newly acquired 20th Century Fox. Two of the 19 come from women: Jennifer Lee co-directed ""Frozen II"" and Roxann Dawson directed ""Breakthrough,"" a faith-based drama. Warner Bros. has 15 films, three of which have a woman behind the camera. (The next one is ""The Sun Is Also a Star,"" a romance from Ry-Russo-Young, which Warner will release on May 17.) Paramount currently plans to release seven movies by the end of the year; ""The Rhythm Section,"" a thriller, is the only one directed by a woman. (That would be Reed Morano, best known as a cinematographer.)

Universal Studios has 15 movies with release dates through December. Four come from women, including ""Little,"" which arrived over the weekend and was directed by Tina Gordon, and ""Queen & Slim,"" a November drama directed by Melina Matsoukas. Sony Pictures opted not to make a presentation at CinemaCon. The studio has 13 movies on the remainder of its 2019 schedule. Women are directing three of them: ""Charlie's Angels"" (Elizabeth Banks); ""A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood"" (Marielle Heller); and ""Little Women"" (Greta Gerwig). Disney, Warner, Universal and Sony declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. Paramount said in a statement, ""We recognize that, as an industry, we need to afford more opportunities to female film directors, and at Paramount we have publicly committed to doing a better job."" Paramount added that, under an initiative announced in February, all of the studio's film and television projects must submit a ""diversity and inclusion plan"" before greenlight. Paramount is also participating in a Time's Up-backed effort to boost opportunities for female directors.

The only studio executive who agreed to be interviewed for this article was Adam Fogelson, the chairman of STXfilms Motion Picture Group, a five-year-old operation. Much of its output involves female-focused movies like the Amy Schumer vehicle ""I Feel Pretty,"" directed by Abby Kohn and Marc Silverstein. ""We're proud of our track record of making films for, with and by women,"" Mr. Fogelson said. ""We see it as an important competitive edge."" He added, however, ""As a husband, a father and a human being in the world, I'm eager for the industry to collectively do better on this front.""

STX currently has six films headed to theaters by the end of the year, two of which have female directors. The first is ""Poms,"" a comedy from Zara Hayes that arrives on May 10. But Mr. Fogelson said a few months' worth of films did not give a sufficient assessment. By his calculation, 18 percent of all STX movies, past and present, have been (or are being) directed by women -- and 14 percent have a woman as lead actor, director, producer and writer. Widening the aperture makes the picture more positive for every studio. Disney recently released ""Captain Marvel,"" with Anna Boden as a director; in the works are two more Marvel films from women (""Black Widow"" and ""The Eternals""). Warner will release a pair of female-led superhero movies of its own in 2020 -- ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" from Patty Jenkins, and ""Birds of Prey,"" from Cathy Yan. At least 10 films with female directors are in development at Paramount, including a new ""Star Trek."" The higher the financial risk, though, the less confidence decision makers have in hiring women. So, major studio films remain the slowest to embrace opportunity parity. Ms. Schulman, who is a former president of the advocacy group Women in Film, also pointed to the misconception that women are best at directing personal stories about women and romance, excluding them from opportunities to direct genres associated with men, like action, adventure, espionage, broad comedy, horror, sci-fi and others. Martha Lauzen, the executive director of the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film and a professor at San Diego State University, cited research showing that women accounted for 8 percent of directors working on the top 250-grossing movies of 2018, down one percentage point from 1998. ""We have not seen any meaningful increase,"" she said, ""in the percentage of women film directors over the last 20 years.""","After years of being called to task for sidelining female filmmakers, studios as a whole continue to rely overwhelmingly on men to lead productions.",b7d17879-d926-5edc-a258-11623f5886ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/arts/14directors-promo/14directors-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d76a03b0197de36f3728dece25fe11dfeb8f4cb9b3d8267d0342cdf2094c1c0e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from top left, Greta Gerwig, Melina Matsoukas, Jennifer Lee, Tina Gordon, Elizabeth Banks and Roxann Dawson.

Economy,Trump Moves to Ease the Firing of Federal Workers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/25/business/economy/trump-federal-workers.html,"Seizing on a longtime ambition of many Republicans, President Trump on Friday overhauled rules affecting at least two million federal workers, making it easier to fire them and rolling back the workplace role of their unions. Mr. Trump, furthering a goal cited in his State of the Union address this year, signed a series of executive orders affecting disciplinary procedures and contract negotiations and limiting the conduct of union business on government time. Andrew Bremberg, the head of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said the president was ""fulfilling his promise to promote more efficient government by reforming our Civil Service rules."" Past administrations of both parties have argued that Civil Service rules are in need of modernization, but Mr. Trump zeroed in on aspects that create sharp partisan divisions. And the action follows growing acrimony between his supporters and the federal bureaucracy that they portray as the deep state.

Unions representing government workers were quick to denounce the actions. ""This is more than union busting -- it's democracy busting,"" J. David Cox Sr., national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest federal employee union, said in a statement. ""These executive orders are a direct assault on the legal rights and protections that Congress has specifically guaranteed."" The executive orders come after a series of prominent Republican victories against public employee unions in recent years at the state level and a rollback of Obama-era policies favorable to labor at the federal level. In the coming weeks, the Supreme Court will rule on a case, propelled by years of conservative philanthropy, that could end mandatory fees for public-sector unions in more than 20 states, dealing a body blow to union coffers. The Trump administration portrayed its new rules as a needed remedy to make a sclerotic work force more efficient and responsive, but Newt Gingrich, who has been an informal adviser to the White House on Civil Service issues, has given a different explanation in the past. In an interview last year, when the administration was considering action, Mr. Gingrich, a former House speaker, said that a major impetus was the federal bureaucracy's ideological opposition to the Trump agenda.

""When you learned that 97 percent of Justice Department donations went to Hillary Clinton, 99 percent of State Department donations went to Hillary, there are some reasons to believe a substantial number of people don't want Trump to succeed,"" Mr. Gingrich said. ""Should the elected president of the United States have the ability to control the bureaucracy that actively opposed him?"" Federal employees' unions have typically been active on behalf of Democratic presidential nominees. Mr. Cox's union announced its endorsement of Mrs. Clinton in the 2016 campaign almost a year before the general election and had previously endorsed Barack Obama. Mr. Trump signed three executive orders. The first makes it easier to fire and discipline federal employees, which a senior administration official, who declined to be named on a call with reporters, argued had become a much too lengthy and difficult process. The administration said that it frequently took six months to a year to dismiss a poorly performing employee, followed by an appeals period averaging eight months. To streamline the process, the official said, the executive order will give poor performers only 30 days to demonstrate improvement, rather than the current limit of up to 120 days, depending on the agency.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The official said the administration would also make performance a more important factor than seniority when agencies undertake layoffs. The second executive order directs federal agencies to renegotiate contracts with unions representing government employees so as to reduce waste. The anonymous administration official expressed hope that, for example, agencies could stop having to pay expenses on both sides when unions undertake appeals on behalf of fired workers. Richard Loeb, a senior policy counsel for the American Federation of Government Employees, said appeals were typically handled by union lawyers not paid by the government.

The administration said it would also post union contracts online so that Americans could review its efforts to negotiate better deals with government workers. The third order aims to cut down on ""official time,"" in which government workers who have roles in the union, like helping colleagues file grievances, are allowed to perform those roles during normal working hours for which they draw their usual salary. (An analogous concept exists for private-sector unions.) The order limits official time to 25 percent of their hours during the year. Administration officials said a subset of federal employees had been able to spend as much as 100 percent of their duty hours on union business, and estimated savings of at least $100 million a year once the order is fully in effect. Mr. Bremberg, the White House domestic policy official, said the actions would make good on the president's call to ""empower every cabinet secretary with the authority to reward good workers and remove those that undermine the public trust or fail the American people."" The executive order making it easier to fire poor-performing workers was an effort to expand on legislation that Congress enacted last year aimed at the Department of Veterans Affairs, which became embroiled in a scandal in 2014 over the extremely long waits that veterans were enduring for health care. According to data collected by the American Federation of Government Employees, more than 1,600 workers have been removed under the provisions of the law passed last year, called the Department of Veterans Affairs Accountability and Whistleblower Protection Act. Among those removed were over 200 housekeeping aides, nearly 150 nursing assistants and nearly 100 food-service workers -- representing three of the top four positions with the most removals. Donald F. Kettl, a professor of public policy at the University of Texas at Austin who is based in Washington, said the number of low-level employees removed suggested the department was not using the legislation to make structural reforms that would improve veterans' access to care.","The president aims to peel back labor protections and curb the power of government unions, which assailed the actions.",d502fc44-5ac2-57d3-bf0e-8027df425df5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/26/business/26WORKER-3/merlin_137616186_fbdd85de-90a0-440f-9488-97af41e28081-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6a33fd48f7e0cc0a5dcccceaeb2b21d9e4a3aa238fe129e2875185e4ce088d79&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Department of Veterans Affairs in Washington.

Economy,Trump's Budget Math Grapples With Economic Reality,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/10/business/economy/trump-budget.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump's budget proposals have been defined by a belief that the economy will grow significantly faster than most economists anticipate. The latest version, released on Monday, is a brief departure: It concedes, for the first time, that the administration's past projections were too optimistic. Then it goes right back to forecasting 3 percent growth, for the better part of a decade. Mr. Trump's $4.8 trillion budget proposal is slightly larger than last year's $4.75 trillion request and calls for increased spending on the military, the border wall, infrastructure and other priorities, including extending the president's 2017 tax cuts. It also includes trillions of dollars of cuts to safety-net programs like Medicaid and discretionary spending programs outside of the military, like education and the environment. The White House makes the case that this is affordable and that the deficit will start to fall, dropping below $1 trillion in the 2021 fiscal year, and that the budget will be balanced by 2035. That projection relies on rosy assumptions about growth and the accumulation of new federal debt -- both areas where the administration's past predictions have proved to be overconfident. The new budget forecasts a growth rate for the United States economy of 2.8 percent this year -- or, by the metric the administration prefers to cite, a 3.1 percent rate. That is more than a half percentage point higher than forecasters at the Federal Reserve and the Congressional Budget Office predict.

It then predicts growth above 3 percent annually for the next several years if the administration's economic policies are enacted. The Fed, the budget office and others all see growth falling below 2 percent annually in that time. By 2030, the administration predicts the economy will be more than 15 percent larger than forecasters at the budget office do. Past administrations have also dressed up their budget forecasts with economic projections that proved far too good to be true. In its fiscal year 2011 budget, for example, the Obama administration predicted several years of growth topping 4 percent in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis -- a number it never came close to reaching even once. Trump officials had considered their projections to be a break from that trend, writing last year that they were the first administration on record ""to have experienced economic growth that meets or exceeds its own forecasts in each of its first two years in office."" That turned out to be wrong: In the middle of last year, the Commerce Department revised its accounting of the 2018 growth rate downward, to well below the rate Trump officials had forecast. Their predictions were similarly off in 2019. Robust economic growth rates are not the only area where the administration's renewed optimism appears in its latest budget. It has also revised down its estimate of the interest the federal government would pay to borrow money over the next decade, based largely on the assumption that the Fed, which began cutting rates in 2019, would raise them only modestly again over the next 10 years. The changes in rate assumptions reduce budget deficits by $1.5 trillion over the course of the decade, according to the administration's projections. Essentially, administration officials are contending that rising levels of debt in the United States will not drive up borrowing costs, as many conservative economists have long warned, at least for the next several years. They also believe, a rarity among economists, that a sustained stretch of 3 percent growth would not push the Fed to raise interest rates. Administration officials do not directly control Fed policy, but in a companion document to the budget, the officials wrote that federal borrowing costs would stay low ""as U.S. debt continues to be in high demand because it is a safe haven for savings amidst global turmoil.""

Such an investment wave never materialized. Capital spending growth turned negative for the last three quarters of 2019. Many forecasters believe that decline was trade related; the budget office, among others, is predicting a bounce-back in investment growth this year. But those forecasters also see growth slowing, over all, as the stimulus fades from Mr. Trump's deficit-swelling tax cuts in 2017 and spending increases he has signed each year in office. Partly as a result of those measures, and the administration's inability to interest Congress in any of its most aggressive proposals for cuts, the federal budget deficit was nearly twice as large last year as the administration projected in its first budget: It topped $1 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office predicts it will continue to grow, hitting $1.3 trillion in 2025 as growth slows to 1.5 percent. For that same year, the new Trump budget predicts that the deficit will be less than half the size -- and that growth will be just under 3 percent. A companion document to the budget includes an alternate forecast for the full decade -- with growth much closer to, but still higher than, independent economists' projections -- in the event that the administration's proposed extensions of tax cuts, continued deregulation, reductions in certain spending programs and other policy changes are not enacted. It notes one reason, in particular, that those efforts might not succeeded this year: ""2020 is an election year,"" the officials write, ""and there is the risk that this will distract from implementation of the necessary policies required for continued increases in prosperity.""",The budget predicts the economy will grow significantly faster than most economists anticipate.,df85a71b-a674-559d-ba18-e8ce3119148a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/10/us/politics/10dc-budgetmath/10dc-budgetmath-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d3627229d6c69a194b44f41b2fd437b0fafa1f3e80e751421ce23d8aac779ca6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump's proposed budget for the 2021 fiscal year was delivered to the Capitol on Monday morning.,df85a71b-a674-559d-ba18-e8ce3119148a,N24News/imgs/df85a71b-a674-559d-ba18-e8ce3119148a.jpg,8
Real Estate,A Sleek Office Building Rises Over Gritty Astor Place,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/realestate/commercial/51-astor-place-rises-over-east-village.html,"For decades, the jobs associated with Astor Place in the East Village usually involved selling Beat Generation paperbacks on a blanket on a sidewalk or, maybe, inking tattoos. But a developer is now betting that office workers would like to ply their trade along the short street, too. Continuing an effort to change the look and feel of the area, Edward J. Minskoff Equities in May will open 51 Astor Place, a 13-story, 430,000-square-foot building that takes up an entire block between Third and Fourth Avenues. Like some condo and school buildings that have sprung up here in the last decade, 51 Astor towers above the neighborhood of mostly low-slung former tenements. Its mirror-quality dark glass walls, which contrast with the colorful mosaics decorating lamp posts in the neighborhood, are also strikingly modernistic. But 51 Astor seems to be the first major office project to try to take advantage of the round-the-clock energy for which the East Village has long been known, and Minskoff Equities hopes that will lure technology companies to the building.

""You've got life down here, so it's safe at night when 25-year-olds leave work,"" said Edward Minskoff, the company's president, on a recent tour that began at a popular meeting place: ""Alamo,"" a cube-like sculpture that adorns a traffic island. In parts of Midtown Manhattan, where Mr. Minskoff also owns high-rises, the sidewalks can become too quiet after dark because of a lack of shops and people. ""It's nowhere's land up there,"" he said. While Mr. Minskoff may be a trailblazer, he benefited from the struggles of Cooper Union, which owns the land under 51 Astor and is across the street. A decade ago, the college, which offers full scholarships to its undergraduates but is considering charging tuition, decided to cash in on its valuable real estate holdings to ease regular budget deficits. Regardless of opposition, city officials in 2002 agreed to allow Cooper Union to commercially develop land, despite its being owned by a nonprofit. As a result, its engineering school at 51 Astor relocated to nearby 41 Cooper Square, a stylish new building by the architect Thom Mayne, and the land at 51 Astor was leased to Mr. Minskoff, who has paid $97 million to hold it for 99 years. The development cost of 51 Astor, which is designed by Fumihiko Maki, is $300 million, with Mr. Minskoff himself contributing $135 million. Because of the recession, he delayed the demolition of the 1950s buildings on the site by about a year and a half, before finally breaking ground in 2011. ""The market wasn't right,"" he said. The new building will feature a black-and-white granite lobby anchored by a 14-foot-tall red rabbit sculpture by Jeff Koons. Three storefronts will wrap around the ground floor, one of which will house a bank, Mr. Minskoff said. A school will occupy a second-floor space. And there will be a public plaza at Astor Place and Third Avenue.

In an unusual move, Mr. Minskoff built the building without having tenants lined up to fill it. He also plans to charge some of the highest rents in Manhattan, and whether the market is strong enough to support those prices remains unclear. The building is asking $88 a square foot for the lower 42,000-square-foot floors, and up to $115 a foot, for the upper 25,000-square-foot floors, which offer views of Brooklyn. Rents in Midtown South, the neighborhood of 51 Astor, tend to be much lower, although a handful of amenity-laden properties can command triple-digit rents. The average asking rent in the first quarter of 2013 was about $50 a foot, according to Avison Young, the commercial real estate firm. Even rents in the desirable Plaza District, around the Plaza Hotel, were only about $80 a foot in recent months, brokers say. Demand for the type of sweeping column-free floor spaces 51 Astor offers has so far seemed weak. The prime buildings in the neighborhood have a 13 percent vacancy rate, according to Avison Young, a rate that is far higher than in other Midtown South office submarkets, like Hudson Square, where it is 8 percent. Microsoft expressed early interest in the building, Mr. Minskoff said. But it has reportedly taken 20,000 square feet at another speculative building, 11 Times Square, for about $60 a foot. Other technology companies, including I.B.M., have toured the property, which is being marketed by Jones Lang LaSalle, but so far there have been no takers. Ultimately, 51 Astor might have to settle for $80 a foot, said Greg Kraut, an Avison Young principal who is not involved with the project, in order to compete with its chief rival in the area, 770 Broadway, which has large floor plans like 51 Astor and where rents are around $75 a foot. Owned by Vornado Realty Trust, 770 Broadway, a landmark full-block former annex of Wanamaker's department store, has offices for AOL, J. Crew and the VNU publishing company. From the floor-to-ceiling windows at 51 Astor, the Broadway building's terra-cotta lion's head details seem close enough to touch. Working against buildings like 770 Broadway and 51 Astor is that some tech companies do not need the huge berths they offer. The 5,000-square-foot spaces offered by Newmark Holdings in a line of its buildings along Astor Place between Broadway and Lafayette Street, for example, may be a better fit for start-ups. Direct Agents, a digital marketing company, recently signed a lease at 740 Broadway, says Brian Steinwurtzel, managing director of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, the management company; and Animoto, an online video company, took space at 440 Lafayette Street last year. Rents in those buildings, which are completely leased, are $40 a foot on lower floors, Mr. Steinwurtzel said.

""I think what's happened in the creative fields is that people want to work close to where they live,"" he said. They also don't want the neighborhood to be totally reinvented, which is partly why Newmark has decided to have Astor Place Hairstylists stay at 2 Astor Place, where it has offered cheap haircuts for decades. ""The neighborhood will always have a casual flavor."" Other changes may be inevitable. This spring, the city's Transportation Department will begin a long-planned project to close streets and expand parks in the area, according to a source close to the project, similar to what has occurred in Times Square. One target is the part of Astor Place between Lafayette Street and Cooper Square, in front of the wavy glass 21-story condo called Sculpture for Living, which the Related Companies developed in 2004 on a parking lot owned by Cooper Union. After closing to cars, the stretch of Astor Place there is slated to become a plaza with bike racks and black gum trees, according to renderings. What is less clear is the effect of gentrification on the area's shops, many of which are clustered on St. Marks Place between Third and Second Avenues. Windows there on a recent day displayed electric blue wigs and a pile of dozens of dolls at Search and Destroy, a punk rock clothing store. Nearby sat a man with a tattoo cobweb across his face, while teenagers panhandled and slurped energy drinks. Despite periodic attempts to change the mix of retail, the block seems proudly resistant to change, even while the rest of the East Village has become more upscale, says William Kelley, executive director of the Village Alliance, the business improvement district responsible for keeping the area clean. ""I think the office workers will bring a new audience,"" Mr. Kelley said. ""But I don't foresee any sweeping changes here for the next 100 years.""","Edward J.

Food,Eater Hires a San Francisco Restaurant Critic,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/20/dining/eater-restaurant-critic-san-francisco-rachel-levin.html,"Eater, the website devoted to food and restaurant news in nearly two dozen American cities, is expanding its footprint in San Francisco with its first dedicated restaurant critic there.

The website, which is owned by Vox Media, has hired Rachel Levin for the position. Ms. Levin is a freelance writer who has covered that city extensively and has also reported on food and restaurants for publications such as The New Yorker, Sunset and The New York Times. She will join Ryan Sutton, who reviews high-end restaurants in New York; Robert Sietsema, whose beat is New York's more affordable restaurants; and Bill Addison, the site's restaurant editor, who covers restaurants across the country.

In an email, Amanda Kludt, Eater's editor in chief, said that since Ms. Levin will be the only Eater reviewer in San Francisco, she is likely to concentrate on midrange and affordable restaurants. She will be ""hitting the very high and very low end only occasionally,"" Ms. Kludt said.

As for why Eater decided on San Francisco, a city awash in money from the technology industry, Ms. Kludt said it was chosen in part because of its dynamic restaurant scene, which includes affordable options and a number of high-end tasting-menu restaurants. ""The concentration of capital in the Bay Area continues to impact the area's restaurant scene in a way that's relevant to a national audience,"" she added, ""so any investment we can make in our coverage in the region is an important one."" Finally, she cited the fact that restaurant criticism in San Francisco has been in the same hands for decades, so Eater thought it would be a good idea to add a new voice.",Rachel Levin is likely to concentrate on midrange and affordable restaurants in a city awash in money from the technology industry.,443088ac-76bf-5d5e-b3eb-f6c0fa8a5c5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/20/dining/20EATER/20EATER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=e6dd1c6df2263fed6767da5c34e36a182350ca5cf832fa90017fff52b17eadc1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rachel Levin, Eater's first dedicated restaurant critic in San Francisco, is likely to concentrate on midrange and affordable places.",443088ac-76bf-5d5e-b3eb-f6c0fa8a5c5a,N24News/imgs/443088ac-76bf-5d5e-b3eb-f6c0fa8a5c5a.jpg,17
Music,The Bad Plus Greet the New Year With a New Lineup,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/arts/music/the-bad-plus-orrin-evans.html,"From left, Ethan Iverson, Reid Anderson and Dave King of the Bad Plus performing at the Village Vanguard last week, during Mr. Iverson's final run with the group.

The Bad Plus was nearing the end of its first set at the Village Vanguard on Saturday night when one spirited fan spoke up between songs. ""We'll miss you, Ian!"" he shouted to the pianist, Ethan Iverson, whose nearly 18-year tenure with this influential trio reached its end the following night. Mr. Iverson looked unmoved, then put his hands on the keyboard and got the next song going: ""1979 Semi-Finalist,"" a chugging old war horse by Mr. King. Mr. Iverson had been stoic all set, and now he seemed downright eager to get the job finished. He is leaving this collective after a period of what looked like outrageous regularity -- full of more than 100 concerts a year, and a steady stream of albums -- but was riddled with tension. The Bad Plus will continue without him. The bassist Reid Anderson and Mr. King have enlisted the pianist Orrin Evans, whose puckish flow differs from Mr. Iverson's approach. Later this month they will release ""Never Stop II,"" the first album featuring the new lineup; it finds the group slimming its sound somewhat, and tightening its shapes.

For a time in the mid-aughts, the Bad Plus was the most important and inimitable act in improvised music, driven by the breakout success of its rollicking cover of Nirvana's ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"" and the untempered provocation of its 2003 major-label debut, ""These Are the Vistas."" There have hardly been any jazz ensembles with a stronger collective identity, or more longevity. Perhaps only the Modern Jazz Quartet outstrips them. Like that quartet -- and the Art Ensemble of Chicago, in other territory -- the Bad Plus developed a devoted following, while reflecting a cultural moment.

The music was jolting and idiosyncratic and kind of maddening, in that it didn't directly resemble any particular influence. Where was this coming from? It didn't sound like the new-thing jazz of the 1960s, or glam rock, or a film soundtrack, or 19th-century Impressionism, though that was all source material. This became especially striking on its covers of pop and rock tunes like ""Teen Spirit"" and Black Sabbath's ""Iron Man."" The band didn't use jazz rhythms or cocktail harmonies, but it didn't just scale down the original songs either. There are no covers on ""Never Stop II,"" which is not surprising; the Bad Plus has made albums of entirely original music before. (""Never Stop,"" from 2010, was its first.) More notable is Mr. Evans's effect on his new comrades' compositions. The group's first five records (through ""Prog,"" in 2007) found Mr. Iverson in constant tension with his band mates, creating dizzy urgency. His playing is crisp and vertical and grandiose; he often seemed to be headed toward some big argument about finality, or totalistic power. In many of the band's most exciting moments, that symphonic style -- drawn from both Keith Jarrett and Benjamin Britten -- scoured hard against the restless surge of Mr. King's drumming, which mixed busted Afro-Cuban rhythms with kinky rock shuffles. Mr. Anderson, with a big bass sound and a narrative impulse, synced up closely with Mr. King, giving Mr. Iverson a thick cushion. But over the past 10 years, the group's approach became rather fixed, and the tension relented, even as the Bad Plus often introduced new collaborators. On albums like ""Made Possible"" (2012) and ""Inevitable Western"" (2014), lullaby-like melodies sometimes felt too easy to get along with. Perhaps the three musicians knew too well what to expect from each other -- or as good will dissipated, so did the willingness to inspirit each other.

On ""Never Stop II,"" the formula scrambles a bit. Mr. Evans is a more fluid pianist than Mr. Iverson, and he aligns more easily with postbop's mainstream language. What does that do to a band that has always tried to define its own idiom? Many of the tunes on the new album -- recorded in September, after just a few rehearsals -- open up into bustling piano solos, something that's not typical of the old Bad Plus. Even on Mr. Anderson's ""Hurricane Birds,"" when Mr. Evans improvises in punched notes and unlinked phrases, a springy groove takes hold. On tunes like Mr. Evans's ""Boffadem"" and Mr. Anderson's ""Safe Passage,"" the pianist's thick and decisive left-hand chords nod toward an established language. It's an exhilarating document, and the first album the Bad Plus has recorded without first road-testing the songs. Mr. Evans is excited to air out the material on a tour starting this month in St. Louis. ""It's a piano-bass-drums trio, it's not a piano trio,"" he said. ""The goal is to try to find your space within that."" When Mr. Iverson informed Mr. Anderson and Mr. King in November 2016 that he wanted to leave, Mr. Evans was their first choice for a replacement. ""We've known each other a long time and played together a lot, and he's a friend,"" said Mr. Anderson, who met Mr. Evans when he was a teenager. ""He also has the right combination, I think: He's a brilliant pianist, but he also has the right irrationality quotient in his playing."" Mr. Iverson had been unhappy in the group for a while. A friendship with Mr. Anderson that began in the mid-1990s went sour years ago, and their tours became uncomfortable. One sticking point was Mr. Iverson's desire to pursue outside projects, and his diminishing enthusiasm for the Bad Plus.

""I was getting to the point where I was bummed to go on the road, just for personal reasons, internally in the band,"" Mr. Iverson said. Mr. King put it simply: ""Ethan has agendas, and Reid and I actually have an agenda for the Bad Plus. That's the difference."" Mr. Iverson runs the blog Do the Math, posting interviews and musical analysis, and sometimes courting controversy. On Jan. 1, he unveiled dothegignyc.com, a home for live reviews and calendar listings of New York jazz, compiled by fellow musicians. He contributes to The New Yorker's website, and is working on a book proposal.

He also plays in the famed drummer Billy Hart's quartet. In October he helped organize the Monk@100 festival in Durham, N.C. He is writing a piano concerto. And he'll soon tour with the Mark Morris Dance Group, where he once was musical director, in a Beatles-themed performance titled ""Pepperland."" And what about the career of Mr. Evans, whose already-scarce free time is basically gone? At 42, he's long been known as one of the most vital figures in straight-ahead jazz -- and an ambassador for the musical treasures of Philadelphia, his hometown. He stays busy: with his Captain Black Big Band, his small and midsize groups, side-musician work, and in the trio Tarbaby (something like an Afrocentric double for the Bad Plus).","A new pianist, Orrin Evans, brings a different sound to the influential jazz group, which has ""Never Stop II"" due out next week.",d7ad2cdb-ea7c-5ee4-87d1-3764bd90f0f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/04/arts/04badplus1/04badplus1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6c3716297f72cb183fe8e0b883a6c406677330e8608945b7fff72330bd9a2588&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Ethan Iverson, Reid Anderson and Dave King of the Bad Plus performing at the Village Vanguard last week, during Mr. Iverson&rsquo;s final run with the group.",d7ad2cdb-ea7c-5ee4-87d1-3764bd90f0f0,N24News/imgs/d7ad2cdb-ea7c-5ee4-87d1-3764bd90f0f0.jpg,12
Opinion,How Moderates Failed Black America,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/opinion/black-america-education.html,"We Americans believe in education. We tend to assume that if you help a young person get a good education and the right skills, then she'll be able to make her way in American society. Opportunity will be bountiful. Social harmony will reign. This formula has not worked for many African-Americans. Over generations, great gains have been made in improving black students' education. In 1968, just 54 percent of young black adults had a high school diploma. Today, 92 percent do. In 1968, about 9 percent of young African-American adults had completed college. Today, roughly 23 percent have. And yet these gains have not led to the kind of progress that those of us who preach the gospel of the American dream would have predicted and that all young people are entitled to. The median income for a white head of household with a college degree is $106,600. The median income for a comparable black college graduate is only $82,300. As my colleagues on the editorial page noted in 2017, black college graduates earned about 21 percent less per hour than white college graduates. Over all, black families earn $57.30 for every $100 white families earn. These pay gaps have been widening since 1979, not shrinking.

If the income gaps are bad, the wealth gaps are horrendous. In 2020, the wealth gap between white and black families is as wide as it was in 1968. Ray Boshara of the St. Louis Fed pointed out that between 1992 and 2013, college-educated whites saw the value of their assets soar by 86 percent, while their black counterparts saw theirs fall by 55 percent. College-educated blacks tend to have higher student loan burdens. When a young white adult wants to buy a home, his parents will often help him out. When a young black man is at that stage, he's more likely to be sending money to his parents to help them out. It turns out that increasing educational opportunities does not by itself reduce income disparities. Nor does it reduce social disparities. Minority students who graduated college were supposed to enter a less racist America. They have not. Seventeen percent of college-educated blacks say they face discrimination ""regularly,"" compared with 9 percent of high school-educated blacks. Half of all black Americans with at least some college said they've feared for their personal safety because of their race, compared with roughly a third of those with less education. Integrated colleges try to create welcoming homes for minority students, and they try to prepare them for adulthood. It's not entirely working. Fifty-five percent of the black graduates of historically black colleges and universities strongly agree that their school prepared them well for life. Only 29 percent of black graduates of non-H.B.C.U. schools feel that way. About half of black H.B.C.U. graduates say their college was ""the perfect school"" for them. Only 34 percent of black non-H.B.C.U. alumni say the same. The gospel of the American dream teaches that as people make it in America they will feel more accepted by America, more at home in America. This is not happening for many African-Americans.

Perhaps you saw Chris Lebron's Times Op-Ed this week. Lebron has taught at the University of Virginia and Yale and now teaches philosophy at Johns Hopkins. A great American success story. But Lebron writes about how unsafe he feels. ""I almost never attend casual faculty functions. I don't go out for drinks. I don't entertain for dinner parties and I don't seek to ingratiate myself into the lives of my white colleagues. ... It's already hard enough to breath in America. Every day you feel like you're living with a knee on your neck."" This profound alienation is not unusual, especially within the upper echelons of American society. Read Critical Race Theory, which started at elite law schools. Read Ta-Nehisi Coates, the most celebrated American writer right now. Read Ibram X. Kendi, one of the best-selling authors right now, who has lost faith in the way schooling is done. He calls Barack Obama's Race to the Top program a racist extension of previous efforts that discriminated against black students. Or read ""Afropessimism,"" by Frank B. Wilderson III, of UC Irvine, who argues that anti-black violence is intrinsic to world history: ""Blacks are not going to be genocided like Native Americans. We are being genocided, but genocided and regenerated because the spectacle of Black death is essential to the mental health of the world."" Many conservatives and moderates say these ideas come from campus culture. People read Foucault and develop an alienated view of the world. The blunt facts, however, suggest that, overstated or not, these writers are responding to something real in the world, something real in the world both of the less educated and of the highly educated. People are responding to the failure of the mainstream, moderate, progressive formula for how to create a more equal pluralist America. I'm a moderate guy, but the evidence doesn't support moderation when it comes to racial equity. Better schooling is essential to creating a fair and equal America. But it is not nearly enough.

Economy,U.S. Growth Halted as Federal Spending Fell in 4th Quarter,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/business/economy/us-economy-unexpectedly-contracted-in-fourth-quarter.html,"The federal government helped bring the economic recovery to a virtual halt late last year as cuts in military spending and other factors overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's expanded campaign to stimulate growth. Disappointing data released Wednesday underscore how tighter fiscal policy may continue to weigh on growth in the future as government spending, which increased steadily in recent decades and expanded hugely during the recession, plays a diminished role in the United States economy. Significant federal spending cuts are scheduled to take effect March 1, and most Americans are also now paying higher payroll taxes with the expiration of a temporary cut in early January. The economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last three months of 2012, the worst quarter since the economy crawled out of the last recession, hampered by the lower military spending, fewer exports and smaller business stockpiles, preliminary government figures indicated on Wednesday. The Fed, in a separate appraisal, said economic activity ""paused in recent months.""

Still, economists said the seemingly bleak gross domestic product report was not a sign that another recession was looming. The preliminary data showed relatively strong spending by consumers and businesses, even as military spending posted its sharpest quarterly drop in 40 years. Forecasters expect that growth this year will rebound to a still-anemic 1.5 percent, a little lower than the pace it has managed over the last three years. ""This is the tip of the iceberg on fiscal austerity from Washington,"" said Ethan Harris, co-head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""It was exaggerated this quarter by the unusually large drop in defense spending, but that and higher taxes will start hurting"" in the coming months. The drop in American exports stemmed in part from a decline in economic growth in Europe, where governments have also been cutting spending in a bid to balance budgets. The parallel contractions are likely to provide fodder for economists who argue that austerity efforts have gone too far in many developed economies. The surprisingly weak numbers could also force politicians to limit the cuts that are scheduled to take effect if Congress fails to produce a budget bargain in the coming weeks and strengthen the argument that deficit reduction is a lesser concern than job creation.

""Our economy is facing a major headwind, and that's Republicans in Congress,"" said the White House spokesman Jay Carney. Republicans said the White House was not advancing concrete plans for creating new jobs and stimulating the economy. ""The bad GDP news makes it even more unbelievable that Obama has been ignoring job growth in his 2nd term agenda,"" Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, posted on Twitter.

The Fed said Wednesday that it would continue its efforts to revive growth by holding short-term interest rates near zero and increasing its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion a month. Those policies aim to reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.

* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. ""The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline,"" the Fed said in a statement. Unemployment has not declined since the Fed started its latest round of purchases in September. The rate was 7.8 percent in December, the same as three months earlier. The government will report the rate for January on Friday.

Although economists expected output to decline substantially from the 3.1 percent annual growth rate recorded in the third quarter, the negative G.D.P. number still caught Wall Street off-guard. It was the weakest economic report since the second quarter of 2009, although revisions in February and March could alter the figure. ""I'm a little surprised,"" said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan. Like some other observers, Mr. Feroli said there were hints the economy was performing slightly better than the headline number suggested. The 22.2 percent drop in military spending, along with the drop in inventories and exports, outweighed more positive indicators in the private sector, he said. For example, residential investment jumped 15.3 percent, a sign that the housing sector continued to recover. Similarly, investment in equipment and software by businesses rose 12.4 percent, an indicator that companies were still spending. For the entire year, the economy grew by 2.2 percent, a slight improvement from the 1.8 percent annual rate in 2011. Despite the unexpected contraction, investors reacted mildly to the news, with the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index falling less than half a percent. If it were not for the drop in total government spending, the economy would have expanded at an annual rate of 1.2 percent in the fourth quarter, said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist at IHS Global Insight. Alan Krueger, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, wrote in a blog post that ""a likely explanation"" for the plunge in military spending was concern among contractors about the automatic spending cuts, which were set to take effect on Jan. 1 but were rescheduled for March 1. The decline in federal spending follows an earlier drop in state and local spending, which fell by 3.4 percent in 2011 and 1.3 percent in 2012.",The government played a role in slowing the economic recovery as cuts in military spending and other factors overwhelmed the Federal Reserve's expanded campaign to spur growth.,a1759d14-c0df-5bb3-8434-96ea45aa3e89,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/01/31/business/Econ/Econ-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=368&w=600&s=9208f20234c1e3400f540b812ebb1fd08e2ef0b1ad1a821e13aebc9fd0a1e8db&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Military spending dropped 22.5 percent in the fourth quarter, when automatic spending cuts loomed.

Dance,Flashes of Red Break Through in a Brooding Spanish Landscape,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/11/arts/dance/eva-yerbabuena-stars-in-flamenco-festival.html,"The most prestigious performer in New York's Flamenco Festival 2014 has been Eva Yerbabuena, who presented two programs, ""!Ay!"" and ""Lluvia,"" at City Center this weekend. (The festival continues, but at other New York locations, through March 24.) At the end of ""Lluvia,"" as she danced her long, rich and complex ""Llanto"" solea, she proved herself one of the world's great dancers. Not a moment too soon: All of her first program (""!Ay!,"" on Saturday evening) had been horrid -- and the first sections of ""Lluvia"" (on Sunday night) had been worse.

Though it was always apparent that Ms. Yerbabuena was a mistress of the flamenco genre, she spent most of the time exaggerating, perverting or parodying it. Mainly she used it for a prizewinning display of anguish: If suffering were a category in the Olympics, she would take top honors. But it's ludicrous for an important dancer to spend large parts of her recitals with her face and torso slumped on a table, as Ms. Yerbabuena did on both evenings. At no point in ""!Ay!"" or the first half of ""Lluvia"" could we feel dance as music making. Instead the emphasis was all Expressionistic, all labored and all tiresome.

It's remarkable that, when Ms. Yerbabuena dropped Expressionism and became musically complex in ""Llanto,"" she also became a far more seriously expressive artist. The long train of her black dress became part of the force of gravity against which she worked. Just to see her gently lean this way or that, as if rooted to the spot but still moving, became exciting, and the opening of her arms, the circling of her hands were all glorious. Then, lifting her skirts and letting her feet thunder and drill (the fullness and force of her heel action is exceptional), she showed all the uncrushable defiance of flamenco.

These, however, were only a few features of ""Llanto.""

Economy,"Jobs Data Show Steady Gains, but Stagnant Wages Temper Optimism",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/08/business/jobs-numbers-for-october-2014-reported-by-labor-department.html,"Only days after many voters complained of worsening economic prospects, the new employment report from the government on Friday provided fresh evidence that the economy was actually getting better, with a sizable jump in the number of people saying they found a job last month. The Labor Department estimated that employers added 214,000 jobs in October, and the official unemployment rate dropped to 5.8 percent, down sharply from 7.2 percent a year ago. The increase in payrolls -- combined with a revision that added 31,000 jobs to previous reports from August and September -- put the average monthly job gain for the last six months at about 235,000. That pace, several analysts said, indicated that the economy was gathering momentum. But the report also found that wages were rising only slightly faster than the rate of inflation, fueling the debate over just how strong the labor market really is. Over the last 12 months, wages are up just 2 percent, which helps explain much of the disconnect between increasingly cheery assessments from many economists and the public's continuing discontent.

Many economists nonetheless found plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the future. The number of people walking away from the labor market has halted, while the average number of hours worked ticked up. And a survey of households, though generally considered less reliable than figures gathered from employers, found that more than 683,000 people had been hired into a new job last month. ""Labor force participation actually rose"" to 62.8 percent, said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at the Northern Trust Company, who noted that the drop in unemployment was not simply a result of people dropping out of the work force. A broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged job seekers or those stuck with only part-time work dropped to 11.5 percent, down more than 2 percentage points from the seasonally adjusted figure from a year ago. The headway on jobs can be seen as validation of the Federal Reserve's decision to end its bond-buying campaign last month, while the lack of wage growth is likely to add caution to the Fed's considerations over when to raise interest rates next year.

""I'm not thinking we're behind the curve,"" Loretta J. Mester, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, told CNBC on Friday, meaning that the latest jobs numbers had not convinced her that the Fed should move more quickly. Some analysts counseled patience on the wage front, predicting that the strengthening job market would soon translate into tangible increases. ""We think this is a very strong report,"" said Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays. ""We will see wage gains going forward. They just didn't show up in this report.""

Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics, said the Labor Department's figures might not reveal all the progress that has been made. ""The employment cost index is a much more comprehensive measure of wage growth, on which the Fed has traditionally put more weight,"" he noted, concluding that ""it shows a very clear acceleration in wage growth"" over the last six months. Perhaps, but as Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez pointed out, what people care about is their weekly paycheck. ""Wages are what matter to living standards,"" he said.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. Mr. Perez noted that workers had benefited from few of the gains in productivity in recent decades. ""Sweat equity isn't translating into financial equity, even while the C.E.O.s of those companies are reaping dramatic rewards,"" he said. ""That's the angst and frustration that I see across this country."" While the recovery from the recession is in its sixth year, stagnant wages and the wide gap between the rewards for those at the top of the income ladder and for ordinary workers have left many people disenchanted with their economic prospects.

Election Day exit polls found that 78 percent of those surveyed were very or somewhat worried about the future of the economy, while two-thirds said they believed the economy was getting worse. The lack of wage growth, particularly at the bottom, helps explain why ballot measures aimed at increasing the minimum wage in Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska, Illinois and South Dakota all passed despite widespread losses in those states among Democrats who supported such measures. ""It may seem counterintuitive that wages and salaries are growing the slowest in industries where jobs are growing the fastest,"" LaVaughn M. Henry noted in an analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's Cincinnati Branch, ""but it actually is not."" Because many of the new jobs in the leisure, hospitality and retail industries require little training or credentials, he explained, there is little pressure to raise wages.

Low-paying leisure and hospitality jobs accounted for nearly one in eight new jobs created in the past year, economists at IHS Global Insight noted, while many of the newly reported hires were teenagers. There were also racial disparities in the job gains, with whites experiencing an unemployment rate of 4.8 percent compared with 10.9 percent for blacks and 6.8 percent for Hispanics. The persistent problem of long-term unemployment showed no signs of improvement this month, with 2.9 million people out of work for 27 weeks or more. This group accounts for about a third of those without jobs. Even the gloomiest assessments, however, acknowledged that no matter how tepid one might think the recovery is, the United States is still far outpacing Europe. Six years after a debt crisis hit the continent, unemployment in the European Union has edged down only slightly to 11.5 percent from a peak of 12 percent last year. It is nowhere near returning to precrisis levels of around 7 percent.","While the report was upbeat, with a survey finding a big increase in the number of people who found a job last month, wage growth continued to drag.",a25d704c-148f-5a8e-bcb0-47376df3cfec,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/08/business/Jobs/Jobs-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=392&w=600&s=16d2a6ad511635482c0187bbf86b7f0c75f5a4d7fa00e42aac7c4a74e9e98923&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A health-care career fair in Denver last month.

Opinion,When Innovation Looks Like Dancing Dinosaurs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/opinion/coronavirus-business-new-york.html,"Mr. Winter is a staff photographer on assignment in Opinion. Ms. Lockwood is a fellow in the Times Opinion section.





The hotel lobby is open daily from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m., and on Sundays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Access to the store is limited to six people at a time, and everyone has to use hand sanitizer when they enter and exit. People can only touch the food that they are going to buy. Customers bag their own items. No one shakes hands. At first, standing six feet apart in the improvised grocery store was awkward. ""Now it's just normal,"" Ms. Broderick said. Hank Faber lives in a townhouse on the resort property and walks to the new grocery store to buy milk, eggs, produce and frozen meals. Mr. Faber was formerly relying on Meals on Wheels, but has transitioned to shopping at Greek Peak for food. Mr. Faber is legally blind, and his only complaint about the store is that the lighting is low. ""They usually help me pick out the stuff I need,"" he said.

Ayden Wilber, the resort's director of operations, had the idea to take its new food delivery service one step further. Greek Peak is ""not as well known for delivery, so we were trying to come up with a way to make ourselves a little bit unique,"" he said. While perusing Amazon, Mr. Wilber found and ordered two inflatable dinosaur costumes: one for himself and one for Sean O'Brien, a banquet chef. The costumes arrived on March 25. The next day, the two men delivered pizzas to a family in the dino suits while dancing to ""Uptown Funk"" by Bruno Mars. One of the employees filmed the delivery and posted it to Facebook. ""This for making people's day with a little extra Love!!! I mean BIG extra LOVE,"" one person commented. ""Great job guys, you made my day,"" another added. Soon, they were getting more delivery calls than they could manage. ""I didn't expect the video to go so viral,"" Mr. Wilber said.

The process is quick -- Mr. Wilber and Mr. O'Brien shuffle out of the van, maintaining a six-foot distance from customers. They wear gloves on their hands. One of the dinosaurs unzips the pizza from the bag that keeps it warm and leaves it on the ground at a safe distance. Then, they dance back into the van. ""I don't have very good dance skills so I sort of followed Ayden as much as I could,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""It's funny because if you have a long driveway you can sort of get into the character and dance a little bit."" Short driveways are more difficult, he explains. It's harder to build the anticipation. Their goal is to ""make people laugh and lighten the mood,"" Mr. O'Brien said. ""Ironically, I'm a relatively shy person so getting inside it is a task in itself, but then the realization that no one knows who you are is a little more comforting.""

Angela Gellatly of Cortland received a delivery on April 1 for her family: two pizzas, fried calamari, a salad and mozzarella sticks. She had been to the indoor water park at Hope Lake Lodge, and saw the video of the dinosaur delivery on Facebook. ""We're bored,"" Ms. Gellatly said. ""I think it's genius what they did."" Her family had decided to avoid takeout because of fears about contamination, but they broke that resolve for the dinosaurs. The delivery was an April Fool's joke for her 6-year-old daughter. ""I think that more people should follow their lead,"" Ms. Gellatly said. ""Any kind of entertainment and joy and happiness that we can have right now, I think we have to seize the moment.""

Science,"Saturn With No Rings? It Could Happen, and Sooner Than Astronomers Expected",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/science/saturn-rings-vanish.html,"Saturn With No Rings? It Could Happen, and Sooner Than Astronomers Expected 
* None  An animation depicting what Saturn's rings might look in the next 100 to 300 million years, before they vanish.

Saturn's icy rings are among the most iconic features in the solar system. But they're raining so much water onto the planet that in 300 million years they could rain themselves nearly out of existence, leaving Saturn startlingly ringless. ""What we're seeing is something on the order of about a ton and a half per second,"" said James O'Donoghue of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Md., who reports the conclusions Monday in the journal Icarus. ""The rings of Saturn haven't been around forever,"" he said. ""And they're going to disappear someday."" It's difficult to imagine a solar system without Saturn's rings, but it turns out they are an ephemeral, if majestic, phenomenon. Scientists have long debated the age and expected life span of the rings, and last year, some published findings suggesting that they are not ancient relics from the birth of the solar system, 4.5 billion years ago. Instead, they were fastened onto Saturn within the last few hundred million years -- during the time of the dinosaurs. And now, multiple lines of evidence are converging to suggest that the rings come with an expiration date. ""Saturn's rings appear to be young,"" said Linda Spilker of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., project scientist for the Cassini mission that studied Saturn, who was not involved in the study. ""Maybe we're just in that interesting, lucky period where we get to see Saturn's rings to the level that we see them."" [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] Stretching some 175,000 miles across, Saturn's bangles easily outshine the dark, fragmented rings feebly encircling Jupiter, Uranus and Neptune. In fact, without its icy accouterments, Saturn would look boring and beige compared to some of the other gas giants. Dr. O'Donoghue and his colleagues suggest the rings could wither away in the near future, on the relative scale of solar system time. Earlier this year, the team took a close look at measurements of a charged molecule found in the upper reaches of Saturn's yellowish atmosphere, using the Keck II Telescope in Hawaii in 2011. The molecule, H3+, is made up of three hydrogen atoms (minus an electron). It is created in abundance when minuscule, charged particles escape Saturn's C-ring, spiral into the planet along magnetic field lines and collide with atmospheric atoms in what is called ring rain. After measuring the amount of H3+ in Saturn's upper atmosphere, Dr. O'Donoghue and his team concluded that as much as 4,400 pounds of water are falling onto Saturn each second. Assuming a constant rate of ring rain -- which Dr. Spilker said is a substantial unknown -- the team calculated that Saturn's rings could mostly shed themselves into oblivion within 300 million years. ""It's not out of the question, I would say, that the rings might degrade on this kind of time scale,"" said Jeff Cuzzi of NASA's Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, Calif., who was not involved in the research. But, he added, ""it doesn't mean that if you come back, there would just be nothing there."" The rate at which the rings might waste away depends not only on how much material is still in the rings, but on other physical forces, Saturn's shifting seasons and the way in which ring material is replenished. NASA's Cassini spacecraft burned up in Saturn's atmosphere on Friday, after 20 years in space. Recent research using data from the Cassini spacecraft, which winged its way among Saturn and its moons for more than a decade, support the group's ring rain estimate. Before Cassini took a fiery, fatal plunge into Saturn in September 2017, it completed a daring series of loops between the planet and its rings. The spacecraft took a census of the particles it encountered that were falling toward the planet; the amount of ring rain Cassini caught is ""completely consistent"" with Dr. O'Donoghue's measurements, Dr. Spilker said. But Cassini also found that a colossal amount of organic molecules and water ice (on the order of 22,000 pounds per second) are falling onto the planet's Equator through a different, potentially transient process that could help hasten the rings' demise. That could mean the rings might disappear even sooner, in less than 100 million years, Dr. O'Donoghue said. Although Dr. Cuzzi is skeptical of the time frame in the new study, he agreed it is likely that the rings will gracefully degrade as the solar system matures. ""I don't think it's unreasonable, with all these numbers being so high, that we have to seriously consider that the rings won't be around forever,"" he said.","The ""ring rain"" that falls into the gas giant is so abundant that the icy bands could disappear in 300 million years, or even sooner.",703c70e7-99ad-5ee4-96ea-1eecad21d377,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/18/science/18TB-SATURN1/18TB-SATURN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=514f4e02a123ad9ddb9347a90be913ed46266f2355b6db4ca7e8bba14ad6583e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Saturn's shadow cast on its rings, which scientists say were only formed a few hundred million years ago.",703c70e7-99ad-5ee4-96ea-1eecad21d377,N24News/imgs/703c70e7-99ad-5ee4-96ea-1eecad21d377.jpg,2

Sports,Patriots Owner Robert Kraft Faces Biggest Test of His Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/04/sports/robert-kraft.html,"Two Fridays ago, Robert K. Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots, was in Los Angeles, one of his homes away from home. He started the day at Nate and Al's, the Beverly Hills delicatessen where he occasionally dines with friends, including Larry King and Steve Tisch, the co-owner of the Giants. Later that day, he was supposed to play golf with Al Michaels, the longtime host of ""Sunday Night Football."" Kraft never made it to the first tee at the Bel-Air Country Club. During the morning he received word that the police 2,600 miles away in Florida were charging him with two counts of soliciting a prostitute at a massage parlor in Jupiter. Since then, authorities have revealed that Kraft is one of hundreds of men facing solicitation charges as part of a case that also encompasses suspected human trafficking in South Florida. [Read more: Behind Illicit Massage Parlors Lie a Vast Crime Network and Modern Indentured Servitude] Suddenly, Kraft's off-season, and perhaps his status as one of the most influential N.F.L. owners, had been turned upside down.

It is telling that he received the news while in Los Angeles, the capital of the entertainment industry. In the quarter-century since he bought the Patriots, Kraft has been at the center of countless business decisions affecting the league, from labor agreements to franchise sales to the commissioner's compensation. But Kraft has also left his mark by forming friendships with the leaders of the media companies that pay billions of dollars to televise N.F.L. games. Those contracts account for about half of the N.F.L.'s estimated $14 billion annual revenue. As the chairman of the league's media committee, Kraft has become the N.F.L.'s seemingly indispensable owner, as anyone who holds that position usually is, and he has been expert at getting networks like CBS and Fox to pay previously unimaginable rights fees, and making them feel as if they were lucky to do so. ""He is a clever negotiator,"" said David Hill, the former chairman of Fox Sports. ""He could look at what the broadcaster needed and gauge what they felt they could pay but still leave something on the table so you don't feel like you were gouged.""

On Feb. 25, Kraft pleaded not guilty to the misdemeanor charges. A date in court, where he is likely to be represented by his lawyer, is scheduled for March 27.

He has admitted to meddling in football decisions and alienating his coaches in his early years of owning the Patriots. In 2008, he apologized after his team was fined $250,000 and lost a first-round draft pick because of allegations in 2007 that the Patriots videotaped their opponent's offensive or defensive signals. Coach Bill Belichick was fined $500,000. In 2013, Kraft claimed he was ""duped"" by Aaron Hernandez, the Patriots tight end who was convicted of murder and later killed himself in prison. In ownership circles, Kraft is known to act as a kind of shadow commissioner, forming close relationships with sponsors, vendors, media companies and even the N.F.L. Players Association, and pursuing back-channel communications that can sometimes circumvent his fellow owners and league officials. His influence, though, has limits. Many owners tolerate Kraft's freelancing because he gets results and tries to keep other owners in the loop. But their tolerance runs thin when his team is accused of wrongdoing, as happened in the Spygate scandal and in 2015, when the Patriots were accused of deflating footballs before the A.F.C. championship game. In those cases, owners were not unhappy when the commissioner penalized the team. Numerous former and current league executives and Kraft's ownership brethren declined to comment on the record for this article, as did Kraft. Even privately, many of them were reluctant to criticize him for the solicitation charges, which they consider a personal matter. It is possible, though, that the arrest could diminish Kraft's standing among the owners just as his skill sets and relationships are needed.

The league's television contracts are up for renewal in two years, and the N.F.L. would like new players like Amazon to jump into the fray. Negotiations are likely to be complicated as the league and networks figure out how to value rights for streaming and other new technology. Kraft lost a major ally in Leslie Moonves, his longtime friend, who was forced to step down as chief executive of CBS in September after more than a dozen women accused him of sexual misconduct.

If Kraft is concerned about his own allegations, he is not showing it. While he has not spoken publicly about the charges, which the police said stem from video recordings of him, Kraft has been seen in public, including at a pre-Oscars brunch on Feb. 23 where he was photographed with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and chief executive. When Kraft returned to Boston the next day, he was spotted hugging Patriots quarterback Tom Brady after they got off a private jet. Amid the solicitation case in Florida, it is unclear how involved Kraft will be in league business in the coming months. The N.F.L. is preparing not only for talks with television networks but also for negotiations with the players' union, whose contract expires at the end of next season. Kraft also sits on the finance and compensation committees, and the management council, which represents the league in labor talks. Kraft can be an affable but cunning negotiator, and both his business and people skills were hard to miss in 2011 during negotiations over the collective bargaining agreement. Several owners pushed the league to take a hard line and exploit their leverage over the players' union after a court ruling in their favor, but Kraft was among a contingent of owners leading negotiations in Washington who saw an opening to push the talks across the finish line. While Kraft shuttled back and forth to Boston, where his wife, Myra, was dying of ovarian cancer, he maintained a direct line of communication with leaders of the players' union. After the two sides reached a deal, Jeff Saturday, a member of the union's executive committee, thanked Kraft. ""Without him, this deal does not get done,"" he said at the time. ESPN, where Saturday works, said he was not available for an interview. But nearly all of Kraft's associates contacted for this article said Kraft was a careful listener who asked questions and had a knack for proposing solutions. While he does have a temper, they said, he rarely loses it.","He operates as a kind of shadow commissioner, but it is possible that his solicitation arrest could diminish Kraft's standing among the owners.",17b9a4d8-0628-5414-9b40-f7a95613a051,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/04/sports/04kraft1-print/04kraft1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=df5a453d61faf877e7af46d5d9650213243e9ee0bf0c12c0819d28e65d051b6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft, right, faces two misdemeanor charges of soliciting prostitution at a massage parlor in Florida.",17b9a4d8-0628-5414-9b40-f7a95613a051,N24News/imgs/17b9a4d8-0628-5414-9b40-f7a95613a051.jpg,9
Media,'Morally Impossible': Some Advertisers Take a Timeout From Facebook,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/business/media/facebook-advertisers-trump-zuckerberg.html,"Nima Gardideh, the co-founder of a digital advertising agency, has encouraged his clients to hold back millions in advertising dollars from Facebook. It struck him as ""borderline tone-deaf"" to run ads on social media platforms when they were being used to organize protests against racism and police brutality, he said. And the money spent on ads might have been wasted, since the usual concerns of consumers seemed not to amount to much at a historic moment. But there was something else weighing on his mind: Facebook's hands-off attitude toward President Trump's aggressive, misleading posts. ""We harshly disagree with how Facebook has approached this,"" said Mr. Gardideh, the co-founder of Pearmill, a New York marketing agency with a dozen clients, mostly tech start-ups. ""For the past couple of years, this problem has become bigger and bigger. These massive platforms have to care about free speech issues to some extent, but Facebook is on the extreme end of not caring.""

Unlike Twitter and Snap, which have toughened their stances against Mr. Trump's online statements that contain misinformation or promote violence, Facebook has held firm on its decision to leave his posts alone. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has defended the policy, despite the resignations of some staff members and public criticism from current and former employees. In recent days, many companies have cautiously returned to advertising, after having pulled back during the height of the pandemic in the United States. But some have decided not to advertise on Facebook, now that it has become clear that Mr. Zuckerberg will give the president a wide berth. ""I think this is Facebook's time of reckoning,"" said Dave Morgan, the chief executive of Simulmedia, a company that works with advertisers on targeted television advertising. ""It may not be immediate or dramatic, but advertisers have given Facebook a lot of passes and now we are hearing they are saying it will be harder to stand back."" In late May, the social media companies' dealings with the president diverged. Twitter started fact-checking Mr. Trump, and posted an addendum to a tweet that called for military action against participants in a protest whom Mr. Trump had described as ""THUGS."" ""This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules about glorifying violence,"" the company said in a note attached to Mr. Trump's statement.

Last week, Braze, a software company in New York, withdrew a Facebook ad campaign it had planned later this summer valued at around $60,000. Its chief marketing officer, Sara Spivey, said Facebook's decision to leave presidential statements untouched factored into the decision. ""Facebook is the biggest publishing platform arguably in the world, so of course we want to be on it,"" Ms. Spivey said. ""But the bigger question is Facebook's responsibility to make its platform safe and if we want to be associated with it."" Abe Kasbo, the head of the marketing agency Verasoni Worldwide in Fairfield, N.J., said his agency ceased all Facebook ads soon after Mr. Zuckerberg's comments defending Mr. Trump's posts. Verasoni, a small agency representing regional banks and retailers, said it stopped its $6,000 monthly budget on Facebook ads. ""The amplification of divisive speech and the lack of responsibility that Facebook is taking as a platform forced this,"" Mr. Kasbo said. Ms. Everson, the Facebook executive who deals with marketers, said she had never worked more closely with Mr. Zuckerberg than she has in the past week. She acknowledged that the company's decision on Mr. Trump's social-media statements ""is not a decision that everyone agrees is a perfect decision."" On Friday night, she sent a personal note to top advertisers, attached to a long public post from Mr. Zuckerberg that promised to review some of Facebook's policies.

Education,Forget Goofing Around: Recess Has a New Boss,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/15/education/15recess.html,"NEWARK -- At Broadway Elementary School here, there is no more sitting around after lunch. No more goofing off with friends. No more doing nothing. Instead there is Brandi Parker, a $14-an-hour recess coach with a whistle around her neck, corralling children behind bright orange cones to play organized games. There she was the other day, breaking up a renegade game of hopscotch and overruling stragglers' lame excuses. They were bored. They had tired feet. They were no good at running. ""Why do I have to go through this every day with you?"" replied Ms. Parker, waving her back in line. ""There's no choice.""

Broadway Elementary brought in Ms. Parker in January out of exasperation with students who, left to their own devices, used to run into one another, squabble over balls and jump-ropes or monopolize the blacktop while exiling their classmates to the sidelines. Since she started, disciplinary referrals at recess have dropped by three-quarters, to an average of three a week. And injuries are no longer a daily occurrence. ""Before, I was seeing nosebleeds, busted lips, and students being a danger to themselves and others,"" said Alejandro Echevarria, the principal. ""Now, Coach Brandi does miracles with 20 cones and three handballs."" The school is one of a growing number across the country that are reining in recess to curb bullying and behavior problems, foster social skills and address concerns over obesity. They also hope to show children that there is good old-fashioned fun to be had without iPods and video games. Playworks, a California-based nonprofit organization that hired Ms. Parker to run the recess program at Broadway Elementary, began a major expansion in 2008 with an $18 million grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. It has placed recess coaches in 170 schools in low-income areas of nine cities, including Boston, Washington and Los Angeles, and of Silicon Valley. Playworks schools are not the only ones with organized recess games. In Florida, Broward County's 140 elementary schools swapped recess for 30 minutes of teacher-supervised physical activities in 2007. Last year in Kearney, Neb., the district had a university professor and five students teach recess games and draw in students who tended to stand against the fence.

Although many school officials and parents like the organized activity, its critics say it takes away the only time that children have to unwind. In Wyckoff, N.J., an upper-middle-class township in Bergen County with a population of 17,000, hundreds of people signed a petition in protest after the district replaced recess in 2007 with a ""midday fitness"" program. ""I just can't imagine going through the entire day without a break, whether you're an adult or a child,"" said Maria Costa, a Wyckoff mother of three who said that every day her daughter came home feeling stress after rushing through lunch to run laps. ""It's just not natural."" Recess has since been restored in Wyckoff's middle school, and on alternating days in elementary schools. Dr. Romina M. Barros, an assistant clinical professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx who was an author of a widely cited study on the benefits of recess, published last year in the journal Pediatrics, says that children still benefit most from recess when they are let alone to daydream, solve problems, use their imagination to invent their own games and ""be free to do what they choose to do."" Structured recess, Dr. Barros said, simply transplants the rules of the classroom to the playground. ""You still have to pay attention,"" she said. ""You still have to follow rules. You don't have that time for your brain to relax.""

Adeola Whitney, executive director for Playworks in the Newark area, said that the recess coaches used a playbook with hundreds of games and gave students a say in what they do. ""It's not rigid in any way, and it certainly allows for their creativity,"" Ms. Whitney said. ""In some cases, we're teaching children how to play if they can't go to the park because it's drug-infested, or their parents can't afford to send them to activities."" Each school pays Playworks $23,500 a year to run a recess program -- Broadway Elementary is using a grant from Covanta Energy, which owns a waste-to-energy plant in Newark -- and the rest of the expenses for training, equipment, after-school activities and field trips are covered through the nonprofit's grants and donations. It is not just about fun and games. At University Heights Charter School in Newark, another of New Jersey's eight Playworks programs, students have learned to settle petty disputes, like who had the ball first or who pushed whom, not with fists but with the tried and true rock-paper-scissors. ""Recess used to end with bad feelings that would continue to play out in the first 20 minutes of class,"" said Misha Simmonds, the charter school's executive director. ""Instead of recess being a refreshing time, it took away from readiness to learn."" Ms. Parker, 28, the coach at Broadway Elementary, had worked as a counselor for troubled teenagers in a group home in Burlington, N.C. Besides her work at recess, she visits each class once a week to play games that teach lessons about cooperation, sportsmanship and respect. ""These are the things that matter in life: who you are as a human being at the core,"" she said. Broadway Elementary, with 367 students in kindergarten to fourth grade, rises above a rough-hewn industrial neighborhood in the North Ward. Nearly all the students are black or Hispanic, and poor enough to qualify for free or reduced-price lunches.

There are three 15-minute recesses, with more than 100 children at a time packed into a fenced-in basketball court equipped with nothing more than a pair of netless hoops. On a chilly morning, Ms. Parker shoveled snow off the blacktop so that the students could go outside after being cooped up in the cafeteria during recess in the previous week. She drew squares in blue and green chalk for a game called switch, a fast-paced version of musical chairs -- without the chairs. (She goes through a box of chalk a week.) Ms. Parker, who greets students with hugs and a cheerful ""hello-hello,"" keeps the rules simple so that they can focus on playing rather than on following directions. ""We're trying to get them to exert energy, to get it all out,"" she said. ""They can be as loud as they want. I never tell them to be quiet unless I'm telling them something."" Jose Salcedo, a fourth grader, volunteers as a junior coach, though he said that he and his friends sometimes missed the old recess, because ""nobody would tell us what to do."" Others, like Khizeeq Murphy, 10, say they look forward to playing different games every day. Before, Khizeeq said, he used to just run and dribble a basketball. Kazmir Payne, a second grader, wishes he could have his free time back, but his mother, Kizzy, appreciates the more regimented recess. ""It's better this way because that's how other kids get hurt, when you're horse-playing,"" she said. ""I think the more supervision, the better.""",A growing number of schools use a recess coach to curb behavior problems.,335b950b-e961-5528-b9cb-71fb8b134c6f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/03/15/nyregion/15recess_337-span/15recess_337-395-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=4049f12576e2d8487c45a50605738b45ec9b86de8a33e4038c8b0ccbdf6cfbc7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Children at the Broadway Elementary School in Newark played one of Coach Brandi Parker's games during recess.,335b950b-e961-5528-b9cb-71fb8b134c6f,N24News/imgs/335b950b-e961-5528-b9cb-71fb8b134c6f.jpg,22
Science,NASA's 'Worm' Logo Will Return to Space,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/nasa-logo-worm-spacex.html,"The ""worm"" logo was designed by Bruce Blackburn. He and his design firm partner, Richard Danne, overhauled the visual appearance for NASA in 1975.





It was designed for NASA in the 1970s, and it hasn't been back to space since the 1990s. But in 2020, it will head to orbit once more. It's a logo that a generation grew up with -- a minimalist twisting of red letters that is nicknamed after terrestrial invertebrates. NASA used it from 1975, when it was introduced as part of a cleaner visual redesign for the space agency, to 1992, when it was kicked to the side. But the familiar yet long unused modern symbol will be seen on the side of a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket when two NASA astronauts, Douglas G. Hurley and Robert L. Behnken, head to the International Space Station, a mission scheduled for the second half of May. They will be the first to launch to orbit from American soil since 2011, and the new old logo was dusted off to commemorate the milestone. In 1992, Daniel S. Goldin, then NASA's administrator, decided that the best way to excite people about the future was to harken to the agency's heady early days. He resurrected an earlier insignia with a different nickname -- ""the meatball.""

The meatball -- a blue circle filled with stars, a red swoosh that represents an airplane wing and a spacecraft orbiting the wing -- was NASA's logo during the agency's greatest accomplishments, including the Apollo moon landings, and NASA has used it for the last 28 years. The ""meatball"" logo being painted on the wing of the space shuttle Endeavor in 1998. The worm, however, was not forgotten, especially among members of Generation X such as Jim Bridenstine, the current NASA administrator. Mr. Bridenstine often points out that he is the first administrator to be born after the end of the Apollo program. ""I grew up in the '80s,"" Mr. Bridenstine said in an interview. ""In the '80s, the worm logo was the logo of NASA. I've always been kind of partial to it."" Five years ago, two graphic designers, Jesse Reed and Hamish Smyth, republished an official 1976 document, the ""National Aeronautics and Space Administration Graphics Standards Manual,"" which prescribed how the new logo should be used. The reissue is now in its fifth printing, with more than 30,000 copies sold.

""We had said among ourselves, 'How cool would it be if it actually came back one day?'"" Mr. Smyth said. ""It was kind of the fantasy. We never seriously thought it would happen."" Since 2017, use of the worm logo has been permitted on T-shirts and other souvenirs sold all over the world. ""We've just seen it come to rise in popular culture, in fashion in particular,"" Mr. Reed said. Since the retirement of the space shuttles in 2011, American astronauts have relied on Russia and its Soyuz rockets for transportation to orbit. But as SpaceX was getting close to the first launch of its Falcon 9 rocket and Crew Dragon capsule with astronauts aboard, Mr. Bridenstine thought, ""It would be a fitting tribute to that moment to bring back the worm as an inspiration to the nation."" The announcement of the worm revival was initially scheduled to go out April 1 when it might have been mistaken as an April Fool's joke. It was pushed back a day.

""What they were trying to represent in the '70s was cutting-edge technology,"" Mr. Smyth said. ""They got it so right that it still looks like cutting-edge technology even though it's close to 40 years later."" By coincidence, April 2 is the birthday of Richard Danne, the designer who directed the 1970s graphics reinvention.

""I was thrilled to see the announcement, especially since it arrived on my 86th birthday!"" Mr. Danne wrote via email. ""What a marvelous present here."" It was not a complete surprise. About a month ago, designers from SpaceX reached out to Mr. Reed and Mr. Smyth to find out the correct shade of red they should be using. The men put SpaceX in touch with Mr. Danne. ""Naturally I started putting two and two together,"" Mr. Danne said. In the manual, the color was defined as simply ""NASA Red."" Today, there is a universal color matching system defined by the Pantone company, and NASA Red is Pantone color number 179. For now, the worm will appear just on the one SpaceX rocket, and NASA is keeping the meatball as its primary icon. But Mr. Bridenstine said the worm could find a wider role at NASA. ""We're kind of working through it right now,"" he said. Mr. Bridenstine said he could imagine that a second spacecraft for taking NASA astronauts to the space station, the Starliner built by Boeing, might also sport the worm logo. ""We haven't gotten that far yet,"" he said. ""But I imagine when the Starliner launches, it would likely have the worm as well."" But the Starliner will not have its first crewed flight for a while. After a flawed test flight without astronauts in December, Boeing will repeat the uncrewed mission before launching astronauts, the Washington Post reported on Monday. The company later acknowledged the decision. Regardless of how NASA decides to mix and match two very different designs, fans of the worm are ecstatic that a beloved icon that had been tossed into the dust bins of graphic design indeed has a future.","The new old logo, dropped in the 1990s in favor of a more vintage brand, will adorn a SpaceX rocket that is to carry astronauts to the space station in May.",07cad5c2-bdd0-5466-921b-3ab20d82a436,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/science/06NASA1/06NASA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=00d151791796dcb386728b0bedd3cd0e2b9061766ce423a73a416fd68cc194b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The &ldquo;worm&rdquo; logo was designed by Bruce Blackburn.

Health,Top Sloan Kettering Cancer Doctor Resigns After Failing to Disclose Industry Ties,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/13/health/jose-baselga-cancer-memorial-sloan-kettering.html,"This article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization. Dr. Jose Baselga, the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, resigned on Thursday amid reports that he had failed to disclose millions of dollars in payments from health care companies in dozens of research articles. The revelations about Dr. Baselga's disclosure lapses, reported by The New York Times and ProPublica last weekend, have rocked Memorial Sloan Kettering, one of the nation's leading cancer centers, in recent days. Its top executives scrambled to contain the fallout, including urgent meetings of physician leaders and the executive committee of its board of directors. In his resignation letter released Thursday, Dr. Baselga, who also served as the physician-in-chief, said he feared that the matter would be a distraction from his role overseeing clinical care and that he had been ""extremely proud"" to work at Memorial Sloan Kettering.

""It is my hope that this situation will inspire a doubling down on transparency in our field,"" he said, adding that he hoped the medical community would work together to develop a more standardized system for reporting industry ties. In an email sent to the staff Thursday evening, Dr. Craig B. Thompson, the hospital's chief executive, said that Dr. Baselga had made ""numerous"" contributions to Memorial Sloan Kettering, patients and cancer treatment. Dr. Lisa DeAngelis, the chairwoman of the neurology department, will take over as acting physician-in-chief until Dr. Baselga's successor is hired. The resignation was effective immediately, and he will have no continuing role at the cancer center, although he will stay for two weeks to ease the transition, said Christine Hickey, a spokeswoman for the cancer center. Dr. Thompson echoed comments he made to the hospital staff on Sunday, saying that the cancer center had ""robust programs"" in place to manage employees' relationships to outside companies, but that ""we will remain diligent."" He added, ""There will be continued discussion and review of these matters in the coming weeks."" Dr. Baselga, a prominent figure in the world of cancer research, omitted his financial ties to companies like the Swiss drugmaker Roche and several small biotech start-ups in prestigious medical publications like The New England Journal of Medicine and The Lancet. He also failed to disclose any company affiliations in articles he published in the journal Cancer Discovery, for which he serves as one of two editors in chief.

All told, ProPublica and The Times found that Dr. Baselga had failed to report any industry ties in 60 percent of the nearly 180 papers he had published since 2013. That figure increased each year -- he did not disclose any relationships in 87 percent of the journal articles that he co-wrote last year. In an interview and later statement, Dr. Baselga said he planned to correct his conflict-of-interest disclosures in 17 journal articles, including in The New England Journal and The Lancet. But he contended that in dozens of other cases, no disclosure was required because the topics of the articles had little financial implication. He also said his failed disclosures were unintentional and should not reflect on the value of the research he conducted. Dr. Baselga and Memorial Sloan Kettering said that he had disclosed his industry relationships to the cancer center. Those journals, as well as professional societies like the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the American Association for Cancer Research, said they were conducting reviews of Dr. Baselga's disclosure practices after inquiries from The Times and ProPublica. Dr. Baselga was president of the A.A.C.R. in 2015 and 2016 and appears to have violated disclosure rules for reporting conflicts of interest during that period.

In his statement Thursday, Dr. Baselga said that he took full responsibility for his disclosures and that he had already submitted updates to medical journals ""and will continue to do so until the record is complete."" A spokeswoman for The New England Journal, Jennifer Zeis, said in an email Thursday that Dr. Baselga had submitted changes to his disclosures but that editors had questions for him before the articles could be corrected. A spokeswoman for the A.A.C.R. said that organization was continuing to review Dr. Baselga's disclosures.

Dr. Baselga, 59, is an expert in breast cancer research and played a key role in the development of Herceptin, which was developed by Genentech, a subsidiary of Roche. He came to Memorial Sloan Kettering in 2013 after serving as chief of hematology and oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. Before that he was a leader at the Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain. Medical journals and professional societies have imposed stricter rules about reporting relationships to industry after a series of scandals a decade ago in which prominent physicians failed to disclose payments from drug companies. But medical journals have said they don't routinely fact-check authors' disclosures, and much is left to the honor system. Ethicists say that outside relationships with companies can shape the way studies are designed and medications are prescribed to patients, allowing bias to influence medical practice. Reporting those ties allows the public, other scientists and doctors to evaluate the research and weigh potential conflicts. Jeffrey S. Flier, who was dean of the Harvard Medical School from 2007 to 2016, said medical leaders should be held to a higher standard. ""The higher you are in the organizational structure, the more important it is that you fulfill those obligations,"" he said. ""You're not just another faculty, you're also a faculty to whom other people look up and your reputation is tied to the institution's reputation."" That said, he added, relationships between academic faculty members and the health care industry are essential to developing new drugs. Dr. Baselga has extensive ties to a range of companies, including sitting on the board of the large pharmaceutical company Bristol-Myers Squibb and serving as a director of Varian Medical Systems, which sells radiation equipment and for whom Memorial Sloan Kettering is a client.","Dr. José Baselga, the cancer center's chief medical officer, stepped down days after a report that he had not reported millions of dollars as potential conflicts in dozens of research articles.",c5d8a24c-8e07-5117-a663-27df00e66bce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/14/health/14cancer-print/14cancer-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9bfe433d10ce3cbdf296704d6ad20085a4f4b777608591e03d8b204a02da6cf5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dr. Jos&eacute; Baselga stepped down as the chief medical officer of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.,c5d8a24c-8e07-5117-a663-27df00e66bce,N24News/imgs/c5d8a24c-8e07-5117-a663-27df00e66bce.jpg,1
Travel,"Savoring Costa Rica, Sip By Sip",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/travel/costa-rica-coffee-tours.html,"""Coffee,"" said Buzzy O'Keeffe, the owner of the renowned River Cafe, in Brooklyn, ""is the last thing a restaurant diner tastes -- so it better be good."" For Mr. O'Keeffe, it seems, it's never good enough. Every couple of weeks he assembles his chef and several staff members for a blind tasting of brews from around the world. Those that pass muster -- typically under 20 percent -- might find their way into the restaurant's ever changing house blend, which typically contains beans from Colombia, Brazil, Sumatra and Costa Rica. ""I have been searching for the perfect coffee since my thirties,"" said Mr. O'Keeffe, now in his discriminating seventies. ""I have found that even the perfect blend will vary from time to time, depending on the year's crop -- something like wine but not quite as fickle."" Last year, when I learned that he was planning a trip to coffee plantations in Costa Rica, I asked if I could tag along, a caffeinated cohort one might say.

On a balmy Sunday evening we arrived in San Jose, the country's sprawling capital. We drove 20 minutes to the town of Belen and the Costa Rica Marriott Hotel Hacienda Belen, a delightful Spanish colonial hotel with 299 rooms. On our first morning we enjoyed a typical Costa Rican breakfast. It commenced with spectacular fruits and the country's omnipresent national dish, called ""gallo pinto"" (spotted rooster). It's a simple but tasty combination of black beans, rice, onions and cilantro. Our gallo pinto was served with the customary scrambled eggs, tortillas and natilla, which is like sour cream but not as thick. And on the table was a small bottle of the popular condiment called Lizano, which is like a sweet-savory steak sauce.

Mr. O'Keeffe, tall, dapper, and scholarly looking, was interested in comparing freshly roasted Arabica coffee (Arabica beans are the highest quality; robusta beans are generally for the mass market) with what he purchases once the beans are exported to New York. (They should be very similar if delivered promptly and shielded from air and sunlight.) Our first destination was a coffee company outside of San Jose called Cafe Britt. It was founded in 1985 by Steve Aronson, an American now living in Costa Rica and a world authority on coffee whose career dates to the early 1970s as an apprentice taster in Manhattan's former coffee district, near the South Street Seaport. ""At that time all of the good Costa Rican coffee was exported, and the inferior stuff stayed here,"" Mr. Aronson explained. He wanted to change that. He launched the first gourmet coffee growing and roasting company in the country and began domestic distribution while at the same time building his export trade. Today Britt coffee is sold throughout much of Central and South America.

The company conducts hourlong tours of its half-acre educational plantation, followed by a discussion and a short film. Guests are taken through the steps of coffee bean processing from planting seedlings to harvesting what are called ""coffee cherries,"" large red pods that hold two coffee beans each. Newly planted coffee bushes require three to four years to produce cherries. Once removed the beans are dried, husked in a special machine, graded and packed for transport. Some operations, like Britt, roast their beans in house before shipping. At the end of our tour came a ""cupping,"" the professional term for coffee assessments. (The cupping is not part of the basic tour; there is a $20 supplement per person.) ""O.K., when we begin will the coffee still be hot?"" Mr. O'Keeffe inquired, sitting at a big round table holding about 20 half-filled ceramic cups. (He is a stickler for the proper coffee temperature at his restaurant.) As with wine, the temperature at which coffee is served at professional tastings alters its characteristics -- hot coffee releases more aromatics.

The coffee cups on the table contained brews from Arabica beans cultivated at different altitudes. Among them: Tarrazu, which thrives in the high mountains southwest of San Jose (typically characterized as medium-bodied and high in acid, with hints of chocolate); Tres Rios, east of the capital (also with ample acid and a full, smooth body); Central Valley (the high altitude region west of the capital and known for smooth and full bodied brews); and Orosi, to the southeast, said to be almost floral, although that eluded us amateurs. ""Stir the coffee, then place your nose so it's almost touching it. Sniff. Then lift the cup over your lip and slurp."" Expectoration optional. Mr. O'Keeffe tasted each brew methodically, returning to several for another slurp. He said that, for the most part, the differences were more subtle than he had expected. ""Being down here, I thought I'd be tasting peaches or something,"" he laughed. The Britt tour, about an hour, concludes with a Costa Rican buffet lunch.

The following morning we drove 5,000 feet above the lushly carpeted valley on the slopes of the irascible Poas Volcano, to the two-year-old Starbucks global agronomy complex and visitors' center called Hacienda Alsacia. I would go for the view alone. Situated on a 600-acre working plantation, it is where the company conducts farming research and development, creates programs to help small-scale coffee farmers around the world boost their income and educates the public about what Starbucks calls sustainable coffee. The hour-and-a-half tour is similar to that at Britt but a little longer and more hands on. It starts with demonstrations on how seedlings are planted and allowed to mature, and on how to dry beans by raking them over hot cement. At one point the tour guide asked for a volunteer to help dry the beans under a wilting sun. There were no takers. He drafted Mr. O'Keeffe, who stepped forward wearing the bemused expression of someone called onto the stage by a magician. Four round trips with the rake was enough. A cupping followed, and Mr. O'Keeffe noted that, not surprisingly, the darker the roast the more intensely acidic and flavorful the coffee. Think of Starbucks' sharp and heavily roasted -- some say over-roasted -- product.

Winding down the mountain we happened upon La Casona de Dona Julia, two large barnlike structures with a sign reading ""Comida Autenticamente Costarricense"" (Authentic Costa Rican Cuisine). We sat at a long picnic table and sipped chilled Imperial, a Costa Rican beer. Actually, by the time it arrived it was only half chilled. A word about dining in Costa Rica restaurants: Service is slow, really slow, take-a-walk-between-courses slow. The menu carried all of the country's greatest hits, starting with a platter with gallo pinto along with fried chorizo, chicharron (fried pork belly or pork rinds), tortillas, salchichon (a smoked sausage), refried beans, fried yuca, fried bananas, salad, and delicious chicken with a sprinkling of Lizano sauce. Another Costa Rican staple is called torta de queso, which is kind of a thick, round torte made of melted fresh cheese and ground corn. Every day, at 4 p.m., most Costa Ricans downshift the wheels of commerce to relax with a wedge of torta de queso and coffee. I was eager to sample the national dessert, tres leches, which is a sponge cake drizzled with three sweetened milks: evaporated, condensed and fresh. You find it everywhere. Except Dona Julia.

If you are looking for a little opulence with your Arabica, it can be found half an hour from the airport at Finca Rosa Blanca Coffee Plantation Resort. It is snuggled amid 30 undulating acres of coffee -- everything is assiduously eco-friendly and sustainable -- with 13 tropically themed rooms and two suites (doubles around $350 with tax). The daily two-and-a-half-hour coffee program, which is open to non-guests with reservations ($40 per person), is as much about rainforest ecology and preservation as what you sip at breakfast. Those of an avian bent can roam the heavily shaded 30-acre property to seek out some of the nearly 250 species of tropical birds. ""We're all about being green and sustainable,"" said the farm supervisor and head roaster, Carlos Sanchez. ""Even the hotel -- we built it with recyclable materials.""

Our final stop was in the town of Naranjo, another short hop from the city, at the Espiritu Santo Coffee Tour. The coffee itinerary -- by now I could moonlight as a tour guide -- in a 600-acre plantation is unveiled in seven stages, from planting to merchandising. It can be a long lesson, but the engaging guides sense when to pickup the pace. And not least, they are great with children. That night, over dinner at Bacchus Ristorante in San Jose, Mr. O'Keeffe reflected upon our four-day coffee trek. ""It was interesting to see firsthand how sensitive coffee is to the elements, and to the politics of where it is grown,"" he observed. ""Costa Rica has such an advantage being located here in this pretty much protected valley and in a peaceful, safe country."" Hurtling through so many cups of coffee in four days was educational, he noted, as coffee, like wine, is a moving target -- and the tasting never stops. This reminded Mr. O'Keeffe of a little story he sometimes pulls out of his wallet when in the presence of wine connoisseurs, about a television skit about wine tasting. ""One actor said 'I taste raspberries!' and another said 'I taste pears, peaches, cherries!' and so forth,"" he said. When it came to the final actor, ""He said, 'I taste crushed grapes.' It's like that with coffee tours."" Addresses in San Jose lack street numbers. It's all descriptive. The directions for one house included locating two barking dogs. The business address of our hotel, Costa Rica Marriott Hotel Hacienda Belen: ""700 meters from west of Firestone/Bridgestone (tire stores/auto repair shops)."" Rooms start at $180 a night. From a distance, Soda Tapia across from the popular La Sabana Park and the Museo de Arte Costarricense in San Jose looks like a place you would approach on roller skates, sort of a 1950s burger and fries drive-in with wraparound red-and-white awnings. ""Soda"" is the local term for a casual eatery and sandwich shop. Open late, Soda Tapia attracts a steady stream of well-nourished patrons and families, with a giant menu that includes delicious tropical fruit shakes. Sandwiches cost 2,500 to 3,800 colones, about $6; fruit shakes, 1,400 to 1,800 colones, about $3.",Coffee is one of the country's top exports.

Dance,"To Nudity, Physical and Emotional, a Dance Duo Now Adds Words",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/arts/dance/molly-lieber-eleanor-smith-body-comes-apart.html,"Molly Lieber, left, and Eleanor Smith have been making duets since 2006. Their new one, ""Body Comes Apart,"" opens at New York Live Arts this week.

The dance duets that Molly Lieber and Eleanor Smith have been creating for themselves since 2006 are intensely intimate. Moving together through positions of sculptural beauty that might make you think of Rodin or Degas, the two women seem to exist in a world shrunk down to two. Without overt shows of emotion -- but also not without tension -- they look unusually attuned to each other yet not entirely at ease. The sense of exposure has often been heightened by complete nudity, the sense of mystery deepened by their silence. That is, until the moment late in their 2017 piece ""Basketball"" when Ms. Smith, through clenched teeth, said: ""My name is Eleanor. Fifteen years ago, I was raped."" In their new work ""Body Comes Apart,"" there's a lot more where that came from. The duet, making its debut at New York Live Arts this week, explodes into speech immediately. Nudity is more conspicuous than ever, with the two women stripping down to bend over and spread their legs again and again. But the talking -- a mix of true stories and fiction -- is even more explicit this time, more obscene and clearer about the targets of its satirical contempt: the male gaze and the objectification of women.

This tone is new for the duo, yet Ms. Smith stressed that the content isn't. ""This is not our #MeToo piece,"" she said. For them, their work has always been feminist, always about female interiority, always intended to heal themselves and help others who have experienced sexual trauma. ""But we've been so misunderstood,"" Ms. Lieber said. It's not just a case of missed subtext, of a message not quite coming through. It's not even only about leering male viewers. Some female critics have accused the pair of catering to the male gaze, of arranging their naked or barely clothed bodies for a voyeur's pleasure. ""The hurdle that we're up against as artists is bigger than we thought,"" Ms. Lieber said. ""I would really love it if I never had to open my mouth. Speaking is not my creative means. I'm dying to stay in the body of this dancer who cannot speak and can look powerful doing things that are ambiguous. But it isn't enough. That's why we're talking."" Ms. Smith added that at the beginning of the partnership, she was wasn't yet prepared to tell her rape story. ""Now I'm 35,"" she said, ""and I've worked through a lot of things, and I feel ready to be explicit about putting that in my work. It feels empowering.""

That beginning was 13 years ago, when the two met as dancers in someone else's project. Both had an interest in choreography, so each made a solo for the other. Soon, they became fascinated by fully collaborative creation. ""There's not a sense of Molly makes a section and then Eleanor makes a section,"" Ms. Smith said. ""We're making everything together."" This strict ethos of consensus extended into a joint interview with them. Each was always checking to see that everything she said accorded with the other's point of view. Over the years, they've worked on ways of representing this relationship physically, ways of supporting each other's bodies so that neither is passive, neither dominant. By 2015, when their work ""Rude World"" had its premiere, they had perfected a technique for rolling together on the floor as a single organism. But something else was happening, too. As they improvised together in the studio, the discoveries were not just physical. ""Improvising with deep trust,"" Ms. Smith said, ""you open up freedom and space for each other, so things come up that wouldn't normally -- personal histories, including personal trauma."" They found that their method had created a new context, one that was not hers or hers but theirs. And when their experience of trauma entered into this context, they could feel it physically and intensely but also achieve distance from it and look at it as artists together.

""You can take it and put it back together and mix it up and all of a sudden it makes sense in a new way,"" Ms. Lieber said. For a long time, the product of that mixing up was abstract. At first, the nudity was for them, they said, so that they could listen to each other with more senses, feeling the minute shifts of position and energy skin to skin. And it made all the difference in the world that they were asking this of themselves, that it wasn't some other choreographer saying, ""Now you get naked.""

They wanted the audience to be able to see those subtle shifts as well. By clothing themselves and disrobing throughout a performance, the women hoped to make their audience think about the difference. In ""Body Comes Apart,"" though, both the nudity and the continual putting on and taking off of clothing have grown more overtly confrontational. They do what they did before, but the context has changed. ""Now the nudity is so pronounced that you can't not look at it,"" Ms. Lieber said. ""We're addressing all the insults that are put on us. We're asking for it."" This is made unmistakably clear by the talking, and by the humor. ""Body Comes Apart"" begins with Ms. Lieber leading a mock exercise class, teaching her female students how to feel sexy, how to work out in order to look good during the sex they'll be having later.","Speaking is not their creative medium, but Molly Lieber and Eleanor Smith realized that powerful movement ""isn't enough.""",31a12d5c-59e5-59c6-8ec4-a402bb5d399d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/06/arts/06LIEBER-SMITH-print4/05LIEBER-SMITH2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=50e49ec5eec5977d484cf5f3e518132cd7ffb3cc1b569a7bce8a8160abc0e3e3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Molly Lieber, left, and Eleanor Smith have been making duets since 2006.

Real Estate,House Hunting in Berlin: A Kaleidoscope of Style for $3.2 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/realestate/house-hunting-in-berlin-a-kaleidoscope-of-style-for-3-2-million.html,"This colorful four-bedroom, three-bath home is on the top floor of a four-story building in the residential Schoneberg neighborhood of Berlin. The owners created the 4,488-square-foot apartment by converting two commercial units in 2016 and 2017, according to Oleksandra Shrestkha, an agent with Engel & Volkers Berlin Mitte, which has the listing. The rest of the building is a mix of commercial units and short-term rentals. Each room was designed individually, awash in colors and patterns in a bold ""masquerade style,"" Ms. Shrestkha said. High-end, custom-made fabric wallpapers with varying kaleidoscopic designs cover the walls and ceilings. The floors are tiled, some smooth and glossy, others with tiny metallic mosaics -- often varying in the same room. Modern hanging light fixtures add to the fantasy effect.

The unit is reached by elevator. Inside the entrance, a bright, red-tiled hallway with red hanging globe lights leads left toward the main open-concept living area, or right to three bedrooms. The living area includes a living room, dining space and kitchen. The living room, decorated in gold metallic finishes, has a wall of windows on one side, a vegetated green wall, hanging geometric light fixtures and an electric fireplace. The dining area, decorated in shades of purple and pink, has an array of 16 lantern-style pendant lights hanging above an eight-seat dining table, as well as a television built into the wall. Behind the dining table, a large white cooking island with a tiled top has a sink, oven and cooktop. The high-gloss cabinetry, by SieMatic, is also white, while the ceiling above has a black-and-white dotted pattern. Four wine refrigerators are built into the wall of cabinets behind the island. Behind that wall is a pantry, Mr. Jahnsch said. Past the living area is the master suite, with feather-patterned wallpaper and a modern sectional sofa facing the built-in television. The cavernous spalike bathroom has ornate tiles with reflective geode patterns. A whirlpool soaking tub raised up on two tiers centers the room, and a 10-person sauna is along one wall. There is also a double shower, a glossy black double vanity, and underfloor heating.

The apartment has an alarm system, with panic buttons in several rooms, and a video surveillance camera in the hallway. The price includes 10 outdoor parking spaces and one indoor space in the building's underground garage. The Schoneberg district, in the center of Berlin, is known for its night life, diverse mix of residents, and creative spirit. This apartment is within walking distance of Tempelhofer Field, a former 953-acre airport campus that has been converted to a sprawling park, and Kaufhaus des Westens, the famous department store. Nollendorfplatz, long a center for gay and lesbian pride events, is about a 10-minute walk, Mr. Jahnsch said. An underground rail station is just outside the building. Berlin Tegel Airport is about 45 minutes by car. The long-awaited Berlin Brandenburg Airport, a new international airport delayed for nearly a decade by cost overruns and mismanagement, is slated to open this fall -- ""if a miracle happens,"" Mr. Jahnsch said jokingly. Thirty years after its reunification, the city of Berlin, with roughly 3.7 million residents, is experiencing some growing pains. Strong economic gains and population growth are combining to put pressure on an undersupplied housing market. As of the last quarter of 2019, Berlin ranked fourth among global cities with the strongest annual residential price growth, at 6.5 percent, according to Knight Frank's Prime Global Cities Index. Frankfurt, about 350 miles southwest, was first, at 10.3 percent year over year.

One of the guest bathrooms, with a suspended sink and a circular light fixture similar to the one in the kitchen. ""The trend has been up for the last 10 years,"" said Claire Locke, an account manager for Germany at Knight Frank's offices in London. ""We've seen huge growth."" Although there has been substantial new construction of both rental and ownership housing in the city, it hasn't been enough to keep up with demand from a rapidly expanding population, including an influx of refugees, Ms. Locke said. Berlin added about 250,000 new residents from 2012 to 2017, according to government figures. The resulting spike in rents, which has driven out many older and lower-income residents, prompted the city government to institute a five-year rent freeze in January. The freeze, which only applies to units built before 2014, is scheduled to take effect in March. Ms. Locke estimated that about 85 percent of households in Berlin are renters, making the pool of home buyers a distinct minority. ""Culturally, homeownership isn't a big priority in Germany,"" she said. ""Typically, people in Berlin will rent the same apartment for 10 or 15 years."" Now, however, the severe shortage of rental apartments is causing more locals to consider buying, said Peter Guthmann, the managing director at the Berlin-based Guthmann Real Estate. ""The pressure on the rental market is so big that the only chance to get an apartment is to buy one,"" Mr. Guthmann said, noting that the average asking price for an existing two-bedroom apartment in the city is about 320,000 euros (around $345,000). ""Otherwise, you will wait for a long time. So now we have more of a mix of buyers, Berliners as well as people from abroad.""

The up-and-coming Friedrichshain district, to the east of the city center, is popular with young professionals, thanks to its abundance of clubs, cafes and arts venues, Ms. Locke said. Older Germans looking to come to Berlin to downsize are more likely to buy in prestigious areas on the western side, such as Charlottenburg, she said. Although prices have been rising for some time, Berlin is still a relative bargain compared with other prime cities like London and New York, Ms. Locke said. This is attracting more Asian and Middle Eastern investors looking to diversify their holdings, she said. According to Knight Frank's Berlin Insight report for 2019, Europeans and Americans are the most plentiful foreign buyers, and typically purchase properties in the 300,000 to 700,000 euro range ($325,000 to $760,000). Mr. Jahnsch said Europeans and Americans often are looking for apartments in historic buildings, while Chinese buyers are often more interested in new construction. ""We are lucky we have the entire world coming to invest in Berlin,"" he said. There are no restrictions on foreign buyers in Germany. A notary handles the transaction and sees that the transfer is recorded in the land registry. Lawyers are not generally part of the process, Mr. Jahnsch said.","In the German capital, economic gains and population growth are combining to put pressure on an undersupplied housing market.",b611d15c-c183-5b87-b459-97566ce23604,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/19/realestate/19IHH-BERLIN-slide-7ASA/19IHH-BERLIN-slide-7ASA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=182554dc3b05c95f702dc5a33313c9e9e1e011416b23d1c529adcd21e7925c6f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"One of the bedrooms, done in reds and pinks with flower patterns, has a transparent shower and soaking tub at one end.",b611d15c-c183-5b87-b459-97566ce23604,N24News/imgs/b611d15c-c183-5b87-b459-97566ce23604.jpg,7
Global Business,Pressure for Action at Brussels Meeting,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/business/global/euro-zone-leaders-under-pressure-to-take-action.html,"FRANKFURT -- If the past is any guide, European Union leaders will leave their summit meeting this week waving promises to weave the euro zone more tightly together. They are likely to back a plan to finance infrastructure projects in stricken countries. But unless the usual expressions of resolve are bolstered by concrete action or at least a binding timetable, financial markets are likely to continue to penalize Spain and other troubled countries by pushing up their borrowing costs to levels that will eventually prove unaffordable. ""We know by experience that recent summits have generated expectations that were not met by decisions,"" Joaquin Almunia, vice president of the European Commission, said in Frankfurt last week. ""We at the European Commission hope that this time will be different."" The ideal outcome from the meeting in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, as a rising chorus of central bankers and foreign leaders has made clear, is deliberate movement toward a euro zone in which countries would backstop one another's banks and bonds, while at the same time policing one another's spending.

On Sunday, the Bank for International Settlements, a clearinghouse for central banks whose board includes the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, was the latest to urge euro zone leaders to establish a banking union, including stronger measures to guarantee deposits and prevent bank runs. The International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank have made similar pleas. European leaders are not blind to the dangers confronting the euro zone. Wolfgang Schauble, the German finance minister who is known as an advocate of a stronger European central government, said in an interview published Sunday that Germany may need to hold a referendum on a new constitution within several years, to make it easier for the country to cede budgetary authority. ""In some important political areas we need to transfer more jurisdiction to Brussels, so that not every decision can be blocked by any member state,"" Mr. Schauble told the magazine Der Spiegel. In another indication of the pressure that leaders feel, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany is scheduled to meet President Francois Hollande of France in Paris on the eve of the summit meeting. The two leaders are expected to try to build at least a working relationship, as Ms. Merkel had with Mr. Hollande's predecessor, Nicolas Sarkozy. The reason European leaders are not expected to do anything drastic is that they have not been able to find a way to break the fundamental deadlock between northern countries, led by Germany, and southern countries like Spain and Italy and their ally, France. Leaders like Mario Monti, the prime minister of Italy, want to co-opt Germany's stellar credit rating to lower their own borrowing costs. Ms. Merkel, backed by Germany's central bank and most of the German public, refuses to do that without also having much more say about how the Italians and others spend the money.

A meeting of leaders of the four largest countries in Rome on Friday suggested what might be expected from the full meeting this week. The leaders of Germany, France, Italy and Spain agreed to a 130 billion euro ($163 billion) growth pact, which mostly redirects existing funds. It would also create so-called project bonds, with the euro zone providing credit to private companies for infrastructure projects and job creation. While helpful, the plan, which is expected to be formalized at the meeting, does not address the underlying weaknesses in the architecture of the euro zone. ""The outcome of the summit,"" Commerzbank economists said in a note to clients, ""will only be to produce an economic stimulus program which will have at best a limited effect."" And so the euro zone continues to stumble toward what even normally restrained observers fear could be disaster. Spain's borrowing costs continued their steep climb last week and, without decisive action on a grand vision for the region, are bound to be punished in the week ahead.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. The days leading up to the summit meeting are likely to be tense, adding to the feeling that European leaders are running out of time. ""The very survival of the euro is under threat,"" Athanasios Orphanides, until the end of May a member of the governing council of the European Central Bank, said in Frankfurt last week. Greece's new government must in the days ahead satisfy voter expectations that it will be able to renegotiate the austerity imposed by international lenders.

Spain is expected to begin bargaining with European officials about the terms of a bailout of its banks, who need as much as 62 billion euros in fresh capital, according to audit reports last week. Spain illustrates the dysfunctional relationship between banks and governments and why a banking union is seen as urgently needed. After European leaders committed 100 billion euros, or $125 billion, to recapitalize Spanish banks this month, market relief lasted only a few hours. Investors realized that the Spanish government, whose size is dwarfed by the country's banks, was still liable for the cost of the bailout. The additional burden made Spain look even less creditworthy than before. A banking union would go a long way toward insulating countries from the woes of their banks, and vice versa, proponents say. While everyone agrees that it will take years to forge the euro zone into a unified entity with some of the federal aspects of the United States, elements of a banking union could be put into place quickly, said Mr. Orphanides, a former high-ranking economist at the Federal Reserve. For example, countries could agree to impose a levy on banks that would be used to create a central deposit guarantee fund -- a European Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The fund might reassure depositors and stop the slow-motion bank runs already under way in Greece and developing in Spain. ""Solutions exist if there is the political will to use them,"" Mr. Orphanides said at a conference at the University of Frankfurt. The deposit guarantee fund would be part of a banking union. Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, is expected to make a banking union the centerpiece of a vision for the euro zone he is drafting with three other leaders who, like him, have responsibilities that span national borders.

The other drafters are Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council; Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission; and Jean-Claude Juncker, head of the euro group of euro zone ministers. They plan to present their ideas to the European leaders in Brussels. But the political obstacles to a common deposit guarantee fund and other features of a banking union remain high. A banking union would require a European bank regulatory agency with real power. Political leaders continue to be reluctant to give up control of their own banks, which they can use to steer financing to pet projects. Germany remains wary of any plan that it would wind up paying the most for. The Bundesbank, Germany's powerful central bank, has expressed doubts whether a banking union is possible without much tighter political integration of the euro zone countries. ""For sure it is not a quick fix,"" Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, said in an interview. He added that it also would be important to keep an eye on whether such a plan raised constitutional issues. Germany's highest court has been wary of measures that commit German money without legislative approval. Germany also is unlikely to budge in its refusal to pool euro zone debt, at least until a fiscal union is in place that would allow euro zone countries to veto excess spending. Mr. Monti has proposed using European bailout funds to intervene in debt markets, to cap borrowing costs. But as far as German leaders were concerned, that idea was dead on arrival. The European leaders will want to leave Brussels having accomplished something. They may endorse the idea of putting the European Central Bank in charge of bank regulation, a step toward a banking union. They will probably ratify the growth pact that Mr. Monti, Ms. Merkel, Mr. Hollande and Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy of Spain agreed to on Friday. But the spending is not nearly large enough to solve the crisis, economists at Commerzbank said. That means that, this week anyway, European leaders are not likely to shake their reputation for doing too little, too late.","As central bankers and foreign leaders push for a more unified Euro zone banking system, little has changed in the positions of the four European Union leaders that would need to agree on a plan.",b51e949d-c1b9-5680-aab2-286c5fa0d9d3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/25/business/jpEURO/jpEURO-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=ab0d92c8e01fb39a820f017e50c8eaa28e707f9131bd17933586077eb89fff58&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"From left,  Mariano Rajoy of Spain, François Hollande of France, Angela Merkel of Germany and Mario Monti of Italy.",b51e949d-c1b9-5680-aab2-286c5fa0d9d3,N24News/imgs/b51e949d-c1b9-5680-aab2-286c5fa0d9d3.jpg,24
Travel,"Alone, Happily Alone, in the Tatra Mountains",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/21/travel/52-places-tatra-mountains-slovakia.html,"Our columnist, Sebastian Modak, is visiting each destination on our 52 Places to Go in 2019 list. He spent Easter Sunday in Plovdiv, Bulgaria, before visiting the Tatra Mountains in Slovakia. As any solo traveler knows, there's a fine line between loneliness and blissful solitude. On the 52 Places journey so far, I've relished making unexpected and sometimes profound connections with other people. I still text regularly with people I met in Puerto Rico, 15 stops and more than three months ago; everywhere I've gone so far, when I've put myself out there, I've received unbridled hospitality in return. So when I've found myself alone, like really alone, I've sometimes felt a purposelessness and a resulting sadness. Slovakia, though, had me leaning into solitude, and enjoying a sense of uninhibited joy that you just can't get from other people.

But all that really meant was that the crowds were thinner, the traffic on my drive across most of the country was sparse and while reveling in all the natural beauty that this small country has to offer, I was often left with my thoughts as my only company.

The drive to and around the Tatras is half the fun of the trip, where with quick detours you can catch stunning views of green valleys and tiny villages. For a lot of the trip, I used Google Maps' turn-by-turn directions more as suggestions and often made decisions based on what I could see on the horizon. There was no one around to tell me to do otherwise, after all.

A river valley separates the High Tatras, or Vysoke Tatry, from the Low Tatras, or Nizke Tatry. I based myself in the former -- where the majority of the ski resorts are -- which meant easy access to the best trailheads. But on your way in and out of the national park, it's worth driving through the lowlands to take in the full majesty of the High Tatras from afar.
* None On drives, opt for the smaller roads, which though slower, will take you through the foothills of the Tatras and villages that give glimpses of rural life. Try to make sure to hit Routes 18 and 66 at some point -- two of the most beautiful roads I've ever driven.
* None You can't really go wrong with any of the lodges or family-run guesthouses in Vysoke Tatry -- they're all relatively close to each other, and a train connects the villages if you want to leave the car at home. I opted for the Grand Hotel Praha, an Art Deco mansion in Tatranska Lomnica that was plenty comfortable and offered easy access to the best hiking trails and cable car trips.
* None If you're traveling to the mountains in the spring, bring layers. Weather can change suddenly and drastically -- I found myself changing outfits three times on a four-hour hike. On one day, it snowed for a full eight hours; by the next morning it had all melted and the sun was shining. The trails that crisscross the High Tatras are all well marked with distances and estimated times, so it's easy to choose your route based on your fitness level and ambition. Most importantly, I felt comfortable taking them on alone without getting hopelessly lost.

A must-visit detour, just around 30 miles southeast of the national park, is Spis Castle, a 12th-century complex on top of a steep hill. I had many epiphanies on my trip through Slovakia, with all the time alone driving or hiking lending itself to realizations about my own place in the world and the dizzying magnitude of this yearlong trip. But one of the most poignant moments I had came while standing on top of a watchtower at Spis, looking at the snow-capped mountains hazy on the horizon, and zeroing into the sense of gratitude I felt to be there.

Within the national park, I based myself in Tatranska Lomnica, one of a string of villages that runs along the mountain range. From the town, a series of three cable cars takes visitors all the way up to the top of Lomnicky Stit. At 8,643 feet, it's the second highest peak in the mountain range. Though a sudden shift in weather meant visibility was near zero when I ascended, it was still worth it for the overwhelming sense of smallness I felt, standing on the edge of the mountain and squinting into a white abyss.

I went from Bratislava up into the High Tatras, before descending to Kosice , the country's second largest city, and then returning to the capital. Kosice was a bit of a rude awakening from the overwhelming peace I felt hiking the Tatras alone: the city was a host of the Ice Hockey World Championship and the streets were filled with enthusiastic (read: very drunk) fans from all over the world. Even amid the noise, I found moments of silence, like when I wandered down narrow alleys in the storybook Old Town.",Empty hiking trails and winding roads suit the the 52 Places Traveler's mood in Slovakia.,9ddad38d-b922-5349-b186-1547e267f4d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/26/travel/21ptg-tatra2-promo/21ptg-tatra2-promo-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c89662cf55bb9f1a3c85e60a6df4bca7e8aca412566d3e6bfbd7747c48a46545&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The 12th-century Spis Castle, a Unesco World Heritage Site, sits on top of a hill, just southeast of the High Tatras.",9ddad38d-b922-5349-b186-1547e267f4d7,N24News/imgs/9ddad38d-b922-5349-b186-1547e267f4d7.jpg,4
Sports,Noose Found in Bubba Wallace's Garage,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/sports/bubba-wallace-noose-talladega.html,"""Today's despicable act of racism and hatred leaves me incredibly saddened and serves as a painful reminder of how much further we have to go as a society and how persistent we must be in the fight against racism,"" the driver, Darrell Wallace Jr., who is known as Bubba, said in a statement on Sunday evening.

In a statement on Monday morning, NASCAR said it had opened an investigation. ""We are angry and outraged, and cannot state strongly enough how seriously we take this heinous act,"" the organization said on Twitter. Jay E. Town, the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama, said in a statement on Monday that his office would review the matter alongside the F.B.I. and the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department to determine if any federal laws had been broken. ""Regardless of whether federal charges can be brought, this type of action has no place in our society,"" he said. Courtney Weber, a spokesperson for Richard Petty Motorsports, Wallace's team, declined to provide additional details about the episode and referred to the driver's statement.

The noose was found about two weeks after NASCAR announced it was banning the Confederate battle flag from its events and properties, spurred by the nationwide protests against racism and white supremacy after the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis while in police custody. In its announcement on June 10, NASCAR said that the flag's presence was ""contrary to our commitment to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all fans, our competitors and our industry."" Wallace had called for the flag's ban two days earlier. ""To you, it might seem like heritage, but others see hate,"" Wallace said after NASCAR announced its new policy. ""We need to come together and meet in the middle and say, 'You know what, if this bothers you, I don't mind taking it down.'"" ""No one should feel uncomfortable when they come to a NASCAR race,"" Wallace told Don Lemon of CNN. ""So it starts with Confederate flags. Get them out of here. They have no place for them."" That same week, Wallace and Richard Petty Motorsports revealed a new black paint scheme for his No. 43 Chevrolet, with the slogan ""#blacklivesmatter"" over the rear wheels. On the hood, a black fist and a white fist clasp in a grip above the slogan ""Compassion, Love, Understanding."" The noose episode is another troubling moment for NASCAR, a motor sports giant that has tried to distance itself from a past in which it had cultivated ties with segregationists and harbored racists and their tropes. George C. Wallace, the segregationist Alabama governor, played a crucial role in the development of the Talladega speedway, which opened in 1969 and is along Interstate 20 between Atlanta and Birmingham, Ala.

In the nearly 51 years since the inaugural competition at Talladega, the track has become known on the racing circuit as one of the most likely places to see a Confederate flag. And even though the city of Talladega, whose limits do not technically include the speedway, elected its first black mayor last year, East Alabama can still be rife with racism and its symbols. But in recent years, NASCAR, which has seen attendance and television ratings decline, has sought to step away from its history. In 2015, after a white supremacist killed nine black churchgoers in Charleston, S.C., officials at top tracks urged people not to fly the Confederate flag at competitions, and some of the sport's top drivers, like Dale Earnhardt Jr., spoke out about racism and their opposition to the battle flag.",NASCAR said it was investigating after the noose was found at the Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. The Justice Department and the F.B.I. were also reviewing the matter.,008676d5-264e-52d3-b87d-d94cb9ffb0da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/21/sports/21xp-bubbawallace1/21xp-bubbawallace1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9dc3c202b9e8666d6841ddaad35434d339dc5e79aaec5abce20fc807a87dcd16&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bubba Wallace before a NASCAR Cup Series race in Martinsville, Va., this month.",008676d5-264e-52d3-b87d-d94cb9ffb0da,N24News/imgs/008676d5-264e-52d3-b87d-d94cb9ffb0da.jpg,9

NEW YORK CITY BALLET This season may be the first under the new team of Jonathan Stafford (artistic director) and Wendy Whelan (associate artistic director), but they did not plan it. (It was organized by Mr. Stafford and Justin Peck, the company's artistic adviser, when they were part of the interim leadership team.) The fall lineup (Sept. 17-Oct. 13) includes premieres by Edwaard Liang and Lauren Lovette as part of the fall fashion gala. Mr. Liang , a former soloist with the company and now artistic director of BalletMet, is paired with the designer Anna Sui, while Ms. Lovette , a City Ballet principal, is working with Zac Posen. Along with George Balanchine's evening-length ""Jewels,"" the season welcomes Merce Cunningham's ""Summerspace,"" choreographed in 1958 and first performed by City Ballet in 1966. It's been nearly 20 years since the company danced it: What took so long? It's breathtaking. Also breathtaking is the perennial ""George Balanchine's The Nutcracker"" (Nov. 29-Jan. 5). David H. Koch Theater, Lincoln Center; nycballet.com. RUBBERBAND The Joyce Theater's fall season is the first organized by Aaron Mattocks, the new director of programming, and it will feature live music as part of every performance . The breadth of dance -- from tap and flamenco to modern and ballet -- signals a hopeful future for the Joyce. The season opens with Rubberband, a Canadian company led by Victor Quijada -- a former dancer with Twyla Tharp -- performing ""Ever So Slightly,"" a work for 10 with music by Jasper Gahunia. (The score will be mixed live onstage.) For this Joyce debut, the performers explore the natural reflexes we develop while dealing with the chaos of daily life. Sept. 17-22; joyce.org.

JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS The new season coincides with the opening of the REACH, the center's first expansion since 1971. It's an immersive learning center, a public incubator and a set of performance spaces -- as well as the backdrop for a festival running through Sept. 22. On Sept. 21, that festival includes a National Dance Day event with classes, outdoor performances, live music, film screenings and panel discussions. Later in the season, the Kennedy Center will host a Merce Cunningham celebration featuring Compagnie Centre National de Danse Contemporaine-Angers in ""Beach Birds"" and ""BIPED"" (Oct. 3-5).

Sept. 24-29; trishabrowncompany.org. AYODELE CASEL + ARTURO O'FARRILL The collaboration between this exceptional tap choreographer and dancer and the Grammy Award-winning Mr. O'Farrill has its base in Afro-Latin jazz culture. Their shared musical language ranges from modal jazz to stride piano to danzon to salsa and rhumba. Is it a dance or a music show? Mercifully, in this case, the playing field is level and a delight. One rule applies: Go. Sept. 24-29; joyce.org.

AMERICAN BALLET THEATER The company's fall season is always a feast of one-act ballets: Along with premieres from Twyla Tharp and Gemma Bond, there will be a program devoted to Herman Cornejo, who celebrates his 20th anniversary with Ballet Theater (Oct. 26). He will be featured in Ms. Tharp's latest work, set to Johannes Brahms's String Quintet No. 2 in G (Op. 111). Ms. Bond, a member of the company's corps de ballet, has chosen Benjamin Britten's Suite on English Folk Tunes for orchestra for her first work for the main company. Other ballets include the New York premiere of Jessica Lang's ""Let Me Sing Forevermore,"" a pas de deux set to a medley of songs recorded by Tony Bennett; and revivals of George Balanchine's ""Apollo"" and Clark Tippet's ""Some Assembly Required.""

PERFORMANCE SPACE NEW YORK The organization hosts Kia LaBeija's first large-scale performance work, ""Untitled, the Black Act,"" which takes inspiration from ""Das Triadische Ballett,"" Oskar Schlemmer's Bauhaus dance in three acts. In this commission, presented with Performa (see above), Ms. LaBeija reinterprets the final act, which delves into fantasy and mysticism (Nov. 7-9). And in December, Ray Ferreira, a blaqlatinx dance artist, presents ""to spiral seems to be the only option,"" in which she uses her body to connect to the spirits of those who leapt from slave ships traveling to North America and the Caribbean, and the underwater communities they could have formed (Dec. 19-21). performancespacenewyork.org

RASHAAD NEWSOME New York Live Arts and Philadelphia Photo Arts Center team up for Mr. Newsome's ""Black Magic,"" a holistic exploration of race, identity and oppression. It includes an exhibition at the photo arts center, an installation at New York Live Arts and performances there and at Icebox in Philadelphia. For the performance piece ""FIVE,"" local artists will join the cast for a multimedia work that explores, in part, the art of vogueing. Dancers will represent five elements of the style known as vogue femme: hands, catwalk, floor performance, spin dips and duckwalking. As each dancer takes the stage, an M.C., an operatic vocalist, a black gospel choir and five musicians will improvise. Nov. 8-9; newyorklivearts.org. CAMILLE A. BROWN & DANCERS This choreographer revisits her 2014 Bessie Award-winning ""Mr. TOL E. RAncE,"" the first installment of a trilogy exploring black identity.

SOLEDAD BARRIO & NOCHE FLAMENCA Ms. Barrio, a force of nature, returns to the Joyce with an array of distinct flamenco artists -- as incredible as she is, she isn't afraid to share the stage -- and an evening-length production of solos, duets and ensemble pieces. ""Entre Tu y Yo,"" or ""Between You and Me,"" begins with an exploration of the duet form and gradually builds to a fiery finale in which she, naturally, is the star: Ms. Barrio will perform a semi-improvised solo that explores themes of love, passion, jealousy and death. Nov. 19-Dec. 1; joyce.org. ""AND STILL YOU MUST SWING"" An all-star trio of tap dancers, led by Dormeshia -- she goes by her first name -- performs at the Joyce in a production that also features Derick K. Grant and Jason Samuels Smith. The piece explores the legacy of tap dance by honoring its jazz roots. Dormeshia is a breathtakingly musical dancer and one of the finest tap artists of the day. The evening also includes a special collaboration with Camille A. Brown. Dec. 3-8; joyce.org. ALVIN AILEY AMERICAN DANCE THEATER This ever-popular company returns to City Center with a newly appointed resident choreographer: Jamar Roberts. A veteran company member, Mr. Roberts presents the premiere of ""Ode,"" set to Don Pullen's jazz composition ""Suite (Sweet) Malcolm (Part 1 Memories and Gunshots)""; this work for six dancers takes a timely look at the fragility of life amid a wave of gun violence. In other new repertory, Donald Byrd takes inspiration from Ailey's theatrical roots and history of exploring social issues in ""Greenwood."" There are also company premieres by Aszure Barton (""Busk,"" an episodic look at performance) and Camille A. Brown (""City of Rain,"" a quiet work that pays homage to a lost friend), as well as new productions of dances by Judith Jamison (""Divining,"" from 1984) and Lar Lubovitch ( ""Fandango,"" which was created in 1990 and entered the Ailey repertory in 1995 ). The season also celebrates the career of Masazumi Chaya, who is retiring as associate artistic director after this season, and honors the Ailey School, which turns 50 this year. Dec. 4-Jan. 5; nycitycenter.org. PAM TANOWITZ + SIMONE DINNERSTEIN Collaborations that look good on paper can fall apart onstage, but the evening-length ""New Work for Goldberg Variations"" is stellar from start to finish. Ms. Tanowitz's rigorous, playful choreography blooms around Ms. Dinnerstein, who performs the Bach score at the piano onstage.

20 Make-Ahead Recipes That Will Save You on Thanksgiving Day

Inspired by West African stew, Yewande Komolafe's pumpkin soup has earthiness from peanut butter, brightness from ginger and heat from fresh chiles, all united by creamy coconut milk. DO AHEAD: Make it a few days in advance to enjoy as a simple Thanksgiving lunch while the main meal comes together, or serve small portions as a warming appetizer.

This five-star recipe brings fresh, assertive flavor to the Thanksgiving table and has enough texture to hold up overnight in the fridge. DO AHEAD: Assemble the vinaigrette ingredients in a small jar so you can simply shake before serving. Toss your sliced celery, apples and celery root with just enough vinaigrette to form a light coating, which will prevent them from oxidizing. Refrigerate both elements overnight, then assemble just before the big meal.

When it comes to carbs, some households swear by store-bought family favorites for simplicity, while those with avid bakers have freshly baked bread. These rolls from Erin Jeanne McDowell bridge that divide: The everything bagel topping makes them unique enough to justify the effort. (Just think of all the sandwich combinations you can craft with leftovers.) DO AHEAD: Bake them up to a day or two in advance. To reheat, simply wrap the rolls in a damp paper towel and microwave in 15-second bursts until steamy.

There are many strong opinions out there on whether or not mashed potatoes can be made in advance -- and conflicting methods on how to store them -- but nearly 2,000 readers have given this recipe five stars. Melissa Clark mashes hers with a generous amount of sour cream and butter, folds them into a baking dish and refrigerates them until mealtime. Her trick to keep them moist when reheating? Top -- and protect -- the creamy spuds with a crisp crust of cheesy bread crumbs before baking. DO AHEAD: Cook the potatoes, assemble the casserole, wrap tightly and store it in the refrigerator a day or two before Thanksgiving.

Millie Peartree's green bean casserole takes inspiration from the classic three-ingredient dish, but bumps up the flavor by adding roasted mushrooms and a Parmesan-based cream, with Cajun spices and nutmeg. This is not a dish of crisp-tender greens; they will be soft and creamy, and the topping will provide all the crunch you crave. DO AHEAD: Shorten the roasting time by a few minutes, prepare your sauce and stash both separately in the refrigerator up to a day ahead. Reheat them gently in a saucepan together, slip them into your baking dish, top with the cheesy bread crumbs and fried onions and broil until bubbly.",A little planning goes a long way to help a holiday meal come together easily.,3a05a4fa-7c8c-51ee-8cdb-b78e4d67ae92,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/dining/06apperex-gratin/06apperex-gratin-facebookJumbo.jpg,Melissa Clark's scalloped potato gratin.,3a05a4fa-7c8c-51ee-8cdb-b78e4d67ae92,N24News/imgs/3a05a4fa-7c8c-51ee-8cdb-b78e4d67ae92.jpg,17
Economy,"James D. Wolfensohn, Who Led the World Bank for 10 Years, Dies at 86",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/business/economy/james-d-wolfensohn-dead.html,"James D. Wolfensohn in 2004. He said he was ""throwing a grenade into an entrenched culture"" when he took over the World Bank in 1995.





James D. Wolfensohn, who escaped a financially pinched Australian childhood to become a top Wall Street deal maker and a two-term president of the World Bank, died on Wednesday at his home in Manhattan. He was 86. Mr. Wolfensohn was a force on Wall Street for years, helping to rescue the Chrysler Corporation while working for Salomon Brothers and running his own thriving boutique firm, before President Bill Clinton nominated him to lead the World Bank, the world's largest economic development institution. But he was more than a financier. He led fund-raising efforts as chairman of Carnegie Hall and headed a revival of the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. An accomplished cellist under the tutelage of the renowned Jacqueline du Pre, he performed at Carnegie Hall on his milestone birthdays. And as a university fencing champion, he was part of Australia's 1956 Olympic team, competing in front of his fellow Australians in Melbourne. But his main legacy was his stewardship of the World Bank, to which President Clinton nominated him in 1995 after he had given up his Australian citizenship 14 years earlier to qualify for the job, only to be passed over.

Arriving at the bank's Washington headquarters to begin his first five-year term, he found life there too comfortable and its staff members demoralized -- a professional malaise, he said, that had them denigrating the bank to their families and even to the news media. He immediately attacked the bank's ""complacency and insularity,"" as he put it. He found that the bank's emphasis on technocratic, market-based reforms was inhibiting its central mission: aiding the world's poorest countries. ""I was throwing a grenade into an entrenched culture,"" he wrote in his 2010 memoir, ""A Global Life: My Journey Among Rich and Poor, From Sydney to Wall Street to the World Bank."" A priority for Mr. Wolfensohn was to make field visits to poor nations less ceremonial than his predecessors had, and to listen to poor people themselves describe their governance, history and culture. He mounted a campaign against corruption in World Bank projects, breaking what he called ""a wall of silence"" on the subject. His efforts led to stepped-up audits and put the issue higher on the agendas of developing countries.

Another Wolfensohn initiative was to shift the bank's policy on debt incurred by its mostly impoverished African and South American client countries. Instead of insisting on repayment, he sought to write off much of the debt. ""How, I reasoned, could you have a lending business to borrowers of low credit and then pretend that you would be repaid 100 percent on every loan?"" he wrote. ""I thought that any system that relied on this logic was doomed."" Catching something of a popular wave, including support from Pope John Paul II (who cited the absolving of debt in Leviticus), World Bank directors in 1996 approved $500 million for a relief trust fund; three years later, they relaxed eligibility for faster and deeper debt relief. Mr. Wolfensohn said he was particularly proud of having installed a high-speed communications network linking affiliates in 80 countries, allowing interactive video conferencing and distance learning. ""Modest, he wasn't,"" declared Fauzia S. Rashid, a staff member who worked with him. James David Wolfensohn was born on Dec. 1, 1933, and grew up in Sydney, Australia, where his parents, Hyman and Dora Wolfensohn, had moved from London in 1928. The family, which included an older sister, Betty, was always in financial stress even though his father had at one time moved in the upper echelons of British society: He had met James Armand de Rothschild in the British Army and then served as his private secretary, before having a falling-out that the elder Mr. Wolfensohn never explained. The family's failure to establish itself in Australia weighed heavily on young James from about the age of 7, producing an obsession with monetary insecurity that carried long into his adult life.

As a child Mr. Wolfensohn""was always doing contingency planning in my head."" he recounted in his memoir. ""I remember thinking that if I could have just 10 pounds, my life would be safe. As I grew older I would do calculations on scraps of paper and work out how long I could live on 100 pounds if I only ate cheese and bread."" After early academic failures related to grade levels beyond his years -- he entered the University of Sydney at 16 -- Mr. Wolfensohn suddenly began to thrive under the intense mentorship of a renowned professor, Julius Stone, a friend of his father's. He graduated in 1954. During law school Mr. Wolfensohn obtained a clerkship with a top Sydney firm, Allen Allen & Hemsley, where a colleague introduced him to fencing. Preferring the epee to the saber despite not being tall and lean, he did well against world-class Italian and British competitors in the Melbourne Olympics before, by his account, becoming distracted and losing. ""The most exciting moment in his life was when he made the Olympics"" as a confidence-lacking ""colonial kid,"" his wife, Elaine Wolfensohn, put it in an interview for this obituary in January. ""It had an enormous impact on who he was, who he became."" With full legal credentials, Mr. Wolfensohn worked on a major antitrust case involving American companies and then decided to apply to Harvard Business School. He eventually flew to attend the school free of charge because of his service in the Royal Australian Air Force Reserve. While studying there he met Elaine Botwinick, a Wellesley senior who had grown up in Manhattan and New Rochelle, N.Y. They married in 1961 and had three children, Sara, Naomi and Adam.

Ms. Wolfensohn died in August at 83. An advocate for education and the arts, she was an adviser to many boards of directors, including those of American Friends of the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra and Teachers College at Columbia University. Thursday would have been the Wolfensohns' 59th wedding anniversary. Mr. Wolfensohn is survived by his children and by seven grandchildren. After a brief stint with a Swiss cement company, Mr. Wolfensohn returned to Australia to work for a number of banks, including J. Henry Schroder, which sent him to its headquarters in London and then to run its New York office. But when passed over in London for the chairmanship of Schroder, a blue-blood bastion -- he said the rejection had ""shattered"" his fragile sense of security -- he sought out Salomon Brothers. ""I was being thrown into the deep end of the toughest business in New York,"" he recounted. After his modest British salary, he said, the idea of earning $2 million to $3 million a year ""was both scary and exhilarating,"" because this was his first job without what he called a financial safety net.

Mr. Wolfensohn reorganized and built Salomon's corporate department and helped rescue the Chrysler Corporation through a huge government bailout in 1979 -- the largest in American history at the time. Some partners at the firm thought he had spent too much time on the Chrysler deal, however, and his relationship with Salomon soured. He left the firm after Robert S. McNamara, the head of the World Bank, told him that he had put Mr. Wolfensohn's name on a list of people who might succeed him. To qualify for the post, Mr. Wolfenson quickly became an American citizen, only to see the job go to Alden W. Clausen. (Mr. Wolfensohn later regained his Australian citizenship.) Seizing the chance to fulfill a lifelong dream of owning his own business, he opened James D. Wolfensohn Inc., a boutique Wall Street adviser that immediately thrived.

One prominent deal came after Louis V. Gerstner Jr., chief executive of IBM and a board member of The New York Times Company, called to ask if Mr. Wolfensohn would assist in The Times's purchase of The Boston Globe. ""I felt proud that he had picked us from among all the Wall Street firms, not because I had approached him but because of our reputation for skill and integrity,"" Mr. Wolfensohn wrote in his memoir. ""With the help of our distinguished neighbor and friend, Arthur ('Punch') Sulzberger, the chairman and publisher of The New York Times, and his immensely competent team, we made a successful transaction."" Twenty years later, however, in a period of downsizing, The Times sold The Globe and other New England media properties for $70 million, far below the $1.1 billion it had paid. Mr. Wolfensohn became chairman of Carnegie Hall in 1980 and helped raise about $60 million to renovate it after donating $1 million of his own. Ten years later he was invited to help rescue the financially ailing John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, also as chairman. As he wrote in his memoir, he found the Kennedy Center to be a ""white elephant"" badly in need of physical repairs and more energetic programming. He also worked for decades on behalf of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., and was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the American Philosophical Society. Mr. Wolfensohn was made an honorary officer of the Order of Australia in 1987 and received an honorary knighthood of the Order of the British Empire in 1995. At a dinner party one evening, Mr. Wolfensohn, who was 42 at the time, impulsively said that he had always wanted to learn to play the cello. Ms. du Pre had one delivered the next day and agreed to give him lessons on the condition that he would play a concert on his 50th birthday.

His last major undertaking was in the mid-2000s as a special envoy for a diplomatic group known as the Quartet -- made up of the United Nations, the United States, the Russian Federation and the European Union -- which was seeking an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal in which Israel would disengage from the Gaza Strip. If the deal were struck, he was to help coordinate revitalization efforts once the Palestinian authorities had taken over the area, the U.N. said at the time. ""The Middle East,"" Mr. Wolfensohn grimly observed, ""turned out to be my mission impossible.""","He was a force on Wall Street before taking the reins of the bank in 1995, then proceeded to shake it up.

Automobiles,"A Jaguar F-Type, Modified for Tour de France Duty",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/01/automobiles/a-jaguar-f-type-modified-for-tour-de-france-duty.html,"As with all of Sky's team cars, the F-Type was outfitted with a special electrical system to handle all of the radios used by the team to communicate with riders and receive directions from race officials. On the team's other cars, Mr. Nevinson said, Jaguar found that when the radios were connected to the main electrical system, interference and other odd problems emerged, such as windshield wipers turning on when voltages dropped. Unlike the other team cars, however, the F-Type didn't need special alternator cooling for the added electrical load.

During time trials, mechanics usually sit in a back seat with a tool kit hanging off the seat in front of them. Because those bags didn't fit in the F-Type, Jaguar modified a cargo net to act as a tool carrier.

The modified F-Type team car certainly stood out amid the sea of logo laden team station wagons on Saturday, which was presumably Jaguar's intent. The automaker supplied the team with cars in the hope that they would appear on television when mechanics leapt out to change flat tires, or while they were driving behind riders in small breakaways. Unusual for a car sponsor on the tour, Jaguar also sent a factory mechanic to support Sky, and Jaguar said it would do the same for the Spanish and Italian counterparts of the French bicycle race.

Sky's Jaguars -- in addition to the F-Type, there are 13 XF Sportbrake wagons and five XJ sedans -- are probably the most exotic of the 250 or so team cars supporting the tour. Skoda, Volkswagen's Czech subsidiary, which essentially builds restyled versions of older models from its parent company, supplies the Tour de France organization with its large fleet of cars to carry officials and sponsors. Several teams favor Skoda Superb, which is essentially a recycled Volkswagen Passat, and Octavia, an older version of the VW known as the Jetta SportWagen in the United States.

Along with the Mercedes-Benz E-Class and BMW 5 Series wagons, the long chain of cars that snaked behind the race was filled with a variety of wagons that would be unfamiliar to many people in North America, like the Citroen C5.

For periods in the tour's history, the race organizer required teams to use cars it supplied. When the race was revived after World War II, repainted and bike rack-equipped army surplus Jeeps did the job. In the 1950s, the team cars were Peugeot 203s with their roofs removed, handrails installed for team directors to hold on to while shouting orders at riders and trunk-mounted bike and wheel racks. From 1989 to 2003, the team vehicles in the tour came from Fiat, which also preceded the riders with a daily parade of its model range. Skoda, when it took over the following year, did not continue the practice.

The F-Type managed to meet everyone's expectations, but the time trial did not. When the car was being customized for tour duty, it was widely expected that Sky's Chris Froome, the defending champion, would be using the time trial to cap his second victory in the tour. But Froome quit early because of fractures from three crashes. The best performance supported by Sky's unusual car came from Danny Pate, an American who was 11th for the day and 153rd over all when the race ended on Sunday.",Jaguar sponsored the British Sky team in the Tour de France and modified one of its 550-horsepower F-Type coupes to serve as an unusual support car.,f7d3579c-51ce-57b4-a29a-400d3527d27c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/01/automobiles/01JAGUAR-image2/01JAGUAR-image2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=451&w=600&s=81024da3bd98410cddc969e755079118c24fffea499e8b8f8a4c3d304811c71a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Jaguar F-Type modified to provide support for Sky's Tour de France team.,f7d3579c-51ce-57b4-a29a-400d3527d27c,N24News/imgs/f7d3579c-51ce-57b4-a29a-400d3527d27c.jpg,23
Food,"Maison Pickle, Serving French Dip Sandwiches, Opens on the Upper West Side",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/dining/maison-pickle-nyc-restaurant.html,"MAISON PICKLE Jacob Hadjigeorgis is expanding his pickling of the Upper West Side. Five years ago, he established Jacob's Pickles, serving cured vegetables alongside beer and Southern comfort fare like biscuit sandwiches. Now, about a block away, his new place also serves pickles, but they take a back seat to several iterations of the French dip sandwich, a nearly 100-year-old Los Angeles classic made with roast beef on a hero roll, and pan juices (""au jus"") for dipping on the side. Cocktails, instead of beer, are suggested alongside. All of this is happening in the former Ouest space, a neighborhood favorite that closed in 2015. In fact, one of the chefs, Harold Villarosa, is a Ouest alum. (Glenroy Brown is the executive chef.) In addition to the sandwiches, there will be a more substantial menu than the one that draws a young crowd at Jacob's Pickles, with dishes like chicken livers on toast with gravy, clams casino with bone marrow, salads, steaks and flounder Rockefeller for two. The main dining room's leather banquettes are now straight, not curved. (Opens Saturday): 2315 Broadway (84th Street), 212-496-9100, maisonpickle.com.

BABETH'S FEAST The high-end purveyor of chef-prepared frozen food established on the Upper East Side in 2014 now has a branch with a difference. There is a counter at the entrance with six seats for breakfast, lunch and dinner, permitting customers to try before they buy. The idea is to tempt on the spot with dishes like beef bourguignon, fish curry or coq au vin, served with a side dish, $10.99: 309 Amsterdam Avenue (75th Street), 347-482-0369, babeths.com.

HANOI HOUSE A lengthy stop in Vietnam during a world trip inspired Sara Leveen and Ben Lowell, both of whom worked for Starr Restaurants, to open their first establishment, serving classics like pomelo salad, nem ran crab and pork rolls, Hanoi-style pho bac soup with beef and noodles, and platters of cha ca fish seasoned with turmeric and herbs. The chef, John Nguyen, whose background is Vietnamese and who also worked for Starr, has done some tweaking, creating a banh mi sandwich on brioche with uni. The room, with half the seats at the bar and at high-top tables, is accented with vintage finds. (Wednesday): 119 St. Marks Place (First Avenue), 212-995-5010, hanoihousenyc.com.

Dance,Can a Blind-Date Dance Lead to Love?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/29/arts/dance/flirty-dancing.html,"How would it feel to be hoisted into the air by a total stranger? One day this fall, Cy Sharp, a single mother and events manager living in Los Angeles, wrapped her mind -- and body -- around that question while she rehearsed with the choreographer Travis Wall. She was learning her half of a duet for ""Flirty Dancing,"" a dance-meets-dating reality show that brings couples together for wordless blind dates. Their very first meeting is a dance. ""I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, whoa -- what do you mean lift?'"" Ms. Sharp, 42, said in a recent phone interview, recalling that moment. ""I'm just meeting this person, and you're saying he's going to lift me?"" Taking physical risks for love is at the heart of ""Flirty Dancing,"" an unabashedly feel-good program that begins a six-episode season Sunday on Fox. Modified slightly for American audiences, the show is based on a British series of the same name, now in its second season on Channel 4. On both sides of the Atlantic, the general concept is the same: Without speaking, or even knowing each other's names, two strangers share a choreographed dance -- they learn their parts independently in advance -- and get to know each other through movement alone.

In a phone interview from Los Angeles, Mike Yurchuk, an executive producer of the Fox series, described the show as a throwback ""to an older time, where people would see you from across the room on a dance floor, ask you to dance, and the chemistry that you felt there could be the spark that created a romance."" But while ""Flirty Dancing"" seeks to restore some lost spontaneity to dating in an age of apps, it also thrives on an element missing from most dance on television: an emphasis on dancing not as an activity to be perfected and judged by professional standards, but as a form of meaningful connection between people. On ""Flirty Dancing,"" how dancing looks to an audience matters less than how it feels to the dancers themselves. Still, in the American version, there is an element of competition: One person searching for love dances with two potential matches -- a different duet with each -- and chooses one partner to see again. (The British version, more straightforward, pairs two people who can decide to show up for a second date, or not.) The actress and dancer Jenna Dewan serves as the host and an earnest matchmaker, standing by in the studio as contestants learn their routines and greeting them in the flushed, breathless moments after their dance dates. Mr. Yurchuk, who has worked on ""So You Think You Can Dance"" and other reality competition shows, said ""Flirty Dancing"" was inspired partly by the movie ""La La Land"" and the city-as-a-backdrop romance of its dance sequences. The duets take place at picturesque sites around Los Angeles, tailored to the architecture of each place, like the steps of the Hollywood Bowl or the lampposts of the ""Urban Light"" installation outside the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.

While the participants, who range in age from 21 to 68, might have some dance experience, they aren't professionals. It's up to the show's choreographers, who include Mr. Wall, Tyce Diorio, Kathryn Burns and other big names from the commercial dance industry, to get them feeling comfortable and confident in the span of just a few days. Ms. Sharp, featured in Episode 2, said that in addition to rehearsing with Mr. Wall, she practiced at home, with coaching from her 9-year-old daughter. ""That week when we were filming, I would wake up at 5 a.m. before my kids got up, and I would practice, and then when they woke up I would make them watch,"" she said. ""My daughter, she does competition dance, and she was like, 'Again, mommy, again!'""

Ms. Sharp came to the show not as a total dance novice, but with skills honed from her love of ""a good night out in the club,"" she said. Still, the choreography didn't come easily, particularly moves that required trust, like falling into her partner's arms -- or that big lift. ""We really, really, really spent a lot of time with those moments, because I had walls up,"" she said.

That's another factor setting ""Flirty Dancing"" apart from other dance reality shows: It reveals just how vulnerable dancers need to be, how the physical is psychological and vice versa. Mr. Wall, who worked on three episodes, said his job as a choreographer went beyond just teaching steps. ""You're teaching these people how to let go of their past and to embrace meeting someone new,"" he said. ""The amount of times that people broke down in my arms, crying about the things they thought about themselves, how afraid they are to try this, how afraid they are to let go -- this experience is life-changing for them, so you're playing therapist and dancer and choreographer all at the same time."" Mr. Wall added that working with men tended to be more challenging. ""It is very shocking to me how men just really do not know how to move their hips,"" he said. ""Like, they move as a board. So the first day is usually getting them to relax."" While Channel 4's ""Flirty Dancing"" has included gay couples -- like the guys in a delightful clip that recently went viral on Twitter -- the couples on the Fox series are all heterosexual, so far. Mr. Yurchuk attributed this to the ""limited run"" of the first season and said he hoped to feature same-sex couples in the future, if the series is renewed. So can a blind-date dance lead to love? Ms. Sharp declined to comment on whether she was still seeing the partner she chose. But she did note that since her ""Flirty Dancing"" adventure, she has observed a transformation in herself, whether going out dancing with friends or striding down the street. ""I have not danced the same since the show -- it opened me,"" she said. ""I find myself much freer, much lighter. I'm walking through the world a lot different.""","On the TV dating show ""Flirty Dancing,"" dance is not an activity to be perfected or judged but a meaningful way for people to connect.",762e002e-4842-5138-8b62-67c5fa7c4e92,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/arts/29flirty-dancing-1/29flirty-dancing-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a3d958dee334e0b211665f3cf421bb862efec5f84693fe29f07125db1fcb5f82&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from the first episode of &ldquo;Flirty Dancing,&rdquo; featuring Megan Hunt and Octavius Womack.",762e002e-4842-5138-8b62-67c5fa7c4e92,N24News/imgs/762e002e-4842-5138-8b62-67c5fa7c4e92.jpg,6
Books,A Long Visit to Weimar-Era Berlin Through an Epic Graphic Novel,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/30/books/review/jason-lutes-berlin.html,"Every 40 pages or so in Jason Lutes's BERLIN (Drawn + Quarterly, $49.95), a sequence appears that seems to hold the key to this massive graphic novel. In one of the earliest, a drawing instructor stands before a chalkboard, lecturing on the use of perspective. ""The observer's location is what really determines the placement of a vanishing point,"" he explains, and asks his students to consider the views out of three adjacent windows in the studio. ""Stand still in front of each and imagine it as a framed picture."" The same scene looks different depending on the observer's position. It's a metaphor, of course, for the book itself -- an opus of more than 500 pages set in the late 1920s in the titular city, teeming with journalists and junkmen, artists and runaways, fiery rabble-rousers and burnt-out cases from the First World War, perceiving the city with their own nervous systems. Lutes's labors are the stuff of legend. After the publication of his acclaimed debut, ""Jar of Fools"" (1994), Lutes -- an American who had never been to Germany -- had a eureka moment upon spotting a magazine ad for a book on Weimar Berlin. He would spend the next 22 years realizing his version of that world. ""Jar of Fools"" was both of the '90s and timeless, a slim fable of magicians on the lam in Seattle. The magic in ""Berlin"" is in the way Lutes conjures, out of old newspapers and photographs, a city so remote from him in space and time. He populates ""Berlin"" with characters of every age, social class, and political persuasion: Gudrun Braun, newly unemployed by the zeppelin factory and a mother of three, desperate to make ends meet; three generations of the Jewish Schwartz family, including David, a paperboy hawking the communist periodical A.I.Z.; and Pola Mosse, a nude artists' model who moonlights as a cabaret performer, singing cheeky paeans to modernity. At times Lutes bridges his characters' disparate story lines with dreams, fleeting thoughts and scraps of mass media. In this way ""Berlin"" invokes the polyphonic techniques found in such modernist works as ""Ulysses,"" ""U.S.A.,"" and most pertinent, Alfred Doblin's ""Berlin Alexanderplatz"" of 1929. Real-life figures such as Josephine Baker, Adolf Hitler and the jailed editor Carl von Ossietzky (a Nobel Peace Prize laureate) make cameos, mingling with Lutes's invented lives.

Our guides through this welter of voices and episodes are Kurt Severing, a grizzled journalist for Ossietzky's paper Die Weltbuhne, and Marthe Muller, a young woman escaping her stifling bourgeois upbringing in Koln to launch her sentimental education in the capital. The two meet on a train at the very start, and we know before they do that their lives are now linked. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

With a cigarette welded to his lips, the bespectacled Severing resembles a more dashing Barton Fink. He's witnessed how Germany, in defiance of the Treaty of Versailles, has been developing military aircraft. He's concerned yet politically uncommitted, trusting his own judgment ""over any decrees handed down from Munich or Moscow."" In a bravura passage, sitting at his desk listening to the clacking of typewriters up and down the street, Severing muses that he can ""pick out the coded signatures of men whose work I know: a cuckold theater critic, a dime novelist at play, a shut-in literary essayist, a freelance advertising writer."" He imagines that each page is like a stone, set against the river of time, perhaps one day reaching critical mass and diverting the course of history. But will it happen soon enough? Anyone who's watched 10 minutes of the news in the last two years will feel the tug of relevance in these pages, something Lutes couldn't have predicted back in the 1990s, when he began the series. Actual swastikas don't appear until late in the book; Lutes simply adorns the Nazi flags with white circles, an omission that's perversely effective, making us see the moment when people still might have thought fascism couldn't win. From its topical concerns to its appendix of historical notes, ""Berlin"" screams Important Graphic Novel. And it is: Lutes is incapable of drawing a lazy panel. His scrupulous style makes everything from the font of a store sign to a parlor wallpaper pattern worthy of study, and even his onomotopeia has the ring of genius: the ""takka tak tak"" of typewriter, the sudden ""AHOOGA!"" of a car horn on a busy street. But ""Berlin"" is an unpredictable, at times difficult read. Not all of the characters exist in three dimensions; occasionally the airtight aesthetic screams for something less objective. The dirty secret about graphic novels is how fast they read; it's rare for one to require more than a day or two to finish. (""I hated the lifetime of pain and struggle it took to create a thing that anyone could read in an hour,"" sighs the cartoonist in Matthew Klam's novel ""Who Is Rich?"") Strange as it sounds, one of the virtues of ""Berlin"" is how it resists completion. It took me weeks to get through, at times backtracking in order to clarify who was who, always returning at last to a greater appreciation of Lutes's vision and humanity. In the last pages, the book pitches suddenly, violently forward through time, as though to meet us -- an ending so electrifying that I gasped.

Such politeness is at odds with the anarchic rudeness of Schrauwen's books, which exist on the other side of the mirror from ""Berlin."" His latest, PARALLEL LIVES (Fantagraphics, $24.99), is a slim but potent volume of linked and mangled autofictions, with delirious color chords you only find in dreams. In the first of the new stories, ""O. Schrauwen"" offers an account of his abduction by ""'Grey Aliens' or 'Greys,'"" and the drawings are aptly monochrome. On the spacecraft, he's forced to watch a movie about the entirety of human history, and things slide toward gibbering insanity until Schrauwen concludes with a deadpan tribute to his art form. Also in this garden of unearthly delights: an app that ""allows you to experience life as a cartoon character in an animated world,"" a two-page story of 70 one-inch panels each, and a long final tale in which everything seems up for grabs, from sexuality and physics to the rules of storytelling itself. ""I'm relaying what is happening to me in the form of a first person narrative,"" says one interstellar explorer brightly. ""The audience, wherever, whoever, and whenever it is, will be captivated by my space adventure story."" What nerve! And yet it's true. He gives his name as Olivier Schrauwen.","Jason Lutes's ""Berlin,"" over two decades in the making, explores a society on the verge of collapse.

Fashion & Style,A Runway Show That Ditches the Runway and Isn't Really a Show,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/fashion/ansel-elgort-kate-mara-kandi-reign-rag-bone-film.html,"In September, in a cavernous warehouse on the water's edge of the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, the actress Kate Mara, dressed in all black, stood in front of several American Ballet Theater dancers. They were lined up, wearing red-and-white track pants, powder blue and white T-shirts, sneakers, matching denim tops and bottoms, and pointed stiletto boots (though not all at the same time). The choreographer Benjamin Millepied stood several feet in front of them, while, o ff to the side, Ansel Elgort observed. Along with performers specializing in parkour, hiplet and hip-hop, they had gathered for a one-day shoot of ""Why Can't We Get Along,"" a new short film from Rag & Bone.

It was directed by the production team of Aaron Duffy, who has worked with Google and Spotify, and Bob Partington, as well as Mr. Millepied, and was conceived with the help of Rag & Bone's chief executive and creative director, Marcus Wainwright, to take the place of his runway show. Instead of being shown to industry insiders during New York Fashion Week, it had its premiere on Thursday at the Metrograph and on YouTube, and will debut on Rag & Bone's website on Tuesday.

Mr. Wainwright has had little interest in the catwalk since late 2016. (Last February, as part of the new approach, Rag & Bone swapped a show for a portrait exhibition, featuring subjects including Mikhail Baryshnikov and Keri Russell, most of whom wore the fall 2017 collection.) ""It's the same thing every time,"" Mr. Wainwright said of runway shows. ""This is way more dangerous, way more inspiring, much more complicated. If I've got to spend three months organizing something, I'd rather it was this than a show."" ""This"" is a six-and-a-half-minute phantasmagoric vignette about shifting perspectives, set to an original track by Thom Yorke, best known as the lead singer of Radiohead. All the actors wear Rag & Bone's new collection, though it can be hard to see the clothes given how dizzying the visuals are, an effect achieved through the use of camera rigs that swing through the air, turn the landscape upside down and spin in circles. The rigs, some of which were flown in from England and some of which were built in New York, will be on view at an exhibition on Saturday, Feb. 10, at 107 Norfolk Street.

""There was no sense of, 'We have to tell this narrative,'"" Mr. Millepied said. ""We were creating a mood that worked with that score, that space, that dark mystery, and doing something that had a good structure and showed everybody off."" Mr. Wainwright said, ""The messaging here, seeing and not seeing things, is a reference to people living through their phones these days. This singular vision of seeing the world through a screen. Life's much more interesting than that. Life's much more than a two-dimensional screen."" This was not Rag & Bone's first foray into filmmaking. Along with more than two dozen other video projects, Rag & Bone Films has produced ""Hair,"" a comedic improvised short starring John Turturro and Bobby Cannavale that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival last year, and a 2015 noir-style film about a driver in New York, featuring Michael Pitt and Astrid Berges Frisbey. But the scale of talent and effort involved with the Greenpoint production was unprecedented for the company. The film's three biggest stars -- Mr. Elgort, Ms. Mara and the dancer Kandi Reign -- are celebrities. Mr. Elgort recently shifted away from his ""Fault in Our Stars"" teen fan base as the star of the film ""Babydriver,"" Ms. Mara is best known as the unrelenting journalist in ""House of Cards,"" and Ms. Reign has toured with Chance the Rapper and Young Thug, among others. Asked how Rag & Bone landed them, along with Mr. Millepied, Mr. Wainwright said: ""We're just really nice."" He added, ""You can pay somebody through the nose to do something they don't want to do, or you can come up with something incredibly inspiring that they do want to do, and that was our approach.""

For Mr. Wainwright, the effort and cost are worth it. ""These things need to be able to stand alone,"" he said. ""They're not fashion films, they're not styled as fashion films, they're not planned as fashion films. They're films we provide the wardrobe for."" The clothes are there, they're colorful and stylish, and they appear functional (and several ballet dancers said they were more comfortable in the shoes and clothes than they would be in their usual costumes). But they are by no means the focus. Mr. Wainwright is fine with that. ""It was never about the clothes,"" he said. ""Very few of the things we do are about the clothes.

Media,Washington Post Is Latest News Outlet Barred by Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/14/business/media/trump-kicks-phony-and-dishonest-washington-post-off-his-campaign.html,"Donald J. Trump on Monday said his campaign would revoke the press credentials of The Washington Post, effectively prohibiting journalists from one of the nation's largest newspapers from joining the traveling press corps of the presumptive Republican nominee.

Barring journalists is an almost unheard-of practice for a modern presidential candidate. The Post is the latest major news organization that Mr. Trump has barred from his rallies and events this year, following Politico, BuzzFeed News, The Huffington Post and others.

In a Facebook post on Monday, Mr. Trump accused The Post of ""incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting"" and deemed it ""phony and dishonest,"" although he has granted frequent interviews to the paper's editors and reporters in the past.

It was not immediately clear if Mr. Trump's announcement meant he would end all his communications with Post journalists. Mr. Trump has a propensity to attack the news media, but he is also a keen cultivator of journalists, and he has been known to criticize reporters, then meet with them cordially shortly afterward.","After The Post interpreted an insinuation made by the presumptive Republican candidate, Mr. Trump barred its reporters from his events.",bc7382c9-e502-5205-bf40-5ebcdb9d1385,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/14/business/14WASHPOST/14WASHPOST-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=99bf45513fc0ca9b3d3c1ac4db0f31a512667fc52cf739bbf44f0d6e64ea681d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"It was not immediately clear if Donald J.

Technology,PayPal Agrees to $2.2 Billion Deal for European Payments Start-Up iZettle,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/17/technology/paypal-izettle.html,"LONDON -- Seeking to extend its global reach, PayPal has reached a deal to buy iZettle, Europe's answer to the mobile payments company Square, for about $2.2 billion. The deal would be the company's biggest takeover -- and would underscore the arms race in the world of payments, especially as digital and mobile transactions are increasingly being adopted across the world. The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal. ""Small businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,"" said PayPal's chief executive, Dan Schulman.

The talks were earlier reported by Sky News. IZettle did not respond to a request for comment. The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google's purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft's acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game ""Minecraft""; and Apple's deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.

The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China. Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America. Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures. The purchase would boost PayPal's international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet.","The Silicon Valley digital payments company reached a deal for iZettle, which is Europe's answer to the mobile payments company Square.",655c3d8c-1bc2-5317-8d3a-3b02e3e4b5db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/business/18PAYPAL/18PAYPAL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7920dcf9cecdda14057aeeb8d0dacede95e36121f04825f004ea9c50c86319bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"IZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers, but it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans.",655c3d8c-1bc2-5317-8d3a-3b02e3e4b5db,N24News/imgs/655c3d8c-1bc2-5317-8d3a-3b02e3e4b5db.jpg,20
Music,Welcoming a Black Female Composer Into the Canon. Finally.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/arts/music/florence-price-arkansas-symphony-concerto.html,"In November 1943, the composer Florence Price wrote to Serge Koussevitzky, the music director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, asking him to consider performing her scores. ""Unfortunately the work of a woman composer is preconceived by many to be light, froth, lacking in depth, logic and virility,"" she said. ""Add to that the incident of race -- I have Colored blood in my veins -- and you will understand some of the difficulties that confront one in such a position."" It was her second letter to Koussevitzky; there is no evidence he ever replied to her. Price (1887-1953) was the first black woman to have her music played by a major American orchestra when the Chicago Symphony performed her Symphony in E Minor in 1933. She was a prominent member of the African-American intelligentsia, corresponding with W.E.B. Dubois and setting to music poems by Langston Hughes and Paul Laurence Dunbar.

But after her death, she swiftly faded into the background of a canon dominated by white men, and much of her work was thought to be lost until a trove of manuscripts was discovered in 2009, in what had been her summer home outside of Chicago. Among the pieces found were her two violin concertos, the first recording of which has been released this month by Albany Records, with Er-Gene Kahng as soloist and Ryan Cockerham conducting the Janacek Philharmonic.

""My first impression was that this was such gorgeous, accessible music,"" Ms. Kahng said in an interview. She will also give a live performance of the Violin Concerto No. 2 with the Arkansas Philharmonic Orchestra in Bentonville on Feb. 17. It was dedicated to the violinist Minnie Cedargreen Jernberg, who performed it, a decade after Price's death, at the dedication of an elementary school in Chicago named for Price, but it has never been played with an orchestra. (Full disclosure: Ms. Kahng and I are colleagues at the University of Arkansas's Department of Music.)

Born to a middle-class family in Little Rock, Ark. -- her father was the city's first black dentist, and the governor was said to have been his patient in secret -- Price later wrote that she traveled with her mother to England and France at the age of 5. She was a star when she attended the New England Conservatory, one of the rare private composition students of the school's president, the eminent composer George Whitefield Chadwick. Her mother, however, insisted she conceal her race. Price occupied the prestigious final position in her graduating class's recital, but the program lists her as hailing from ""Pueblo, Mexico.""

In 1893, the composer Antonin Dvorak proclaimed that an American art music should be built on African-American idioms. The musicologist Douglas Shadle has pointed out that, while white composers eagerly took up this directive -- arguably culminating in George Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" -- many largely forgotten African-American composers did as well, and often took exception to what they saw as white appropriation. Price was, Mr. Shadle said in an interview, ""really the culmination of the African-American intellectual stream that followed in Dvorak's footsteps."" She became well-known for her arrangements of spirituals; the great contralto Marian Anderson closed her historic 1939 concert at the Lincoln Memorial with Price's arrangement of ""My Soul's Been Anchored in De Lord.""

But Price did not only quote folk songs. Describing her Symphony No. 3 in a 1943 letter to the conductor Frederick Schwass -- her canvas began to broaden to the symphonic scale in the early 1930s -- Price wrote that ""it is intended to be Negroid in character and expression."" ""In it,"" she went on, ""no attempt, however, has been made to project Negro music solely in the purely traditional manner. None of the themes are adaptations or derivations of folk songs. The intention behind the writing of this work was a not too deliberate attempt to picture a cross-section of present-day Negro life and thought with its heritage of that which is past, paralleled or influenced by contacts of the present day.""

Marquese Carter, a doctoral student at Indiana University who specializes in Price's work, said in an interview that she ""uses the organizing material of spirituals. You may not hear direct quotation, but you will hear playing around with pentatonicism, playing around with call and response, some of these organizing principles that African-American scholars like Amiri Baraka have pointed out as indicative of black musical discourse."" ""Florence Price is a representation in music of what it means to be a black artist living within a white canon and trying to work within the classical realm,"" Mr. Carter added. ""How do we, through that, create a sound that sounds our culture, sounds our experience, sounds our embodied lives?"" The violin concertos offer an answer. The first, from 1939, sometimes sounds like a throwback, echoing Tchaikovsky's famous concerto for that instrument and demonstrating Price's thorough understanding of 19th-century harmony and orchestration. But the second, composed in a single movement in 1952 and long thought lost, is, while still highly lyrical, more concentrated and harmonically adventurous.

""Everything she was doing was musically mainstream but at the same time idiosyncratic,"" he said. ""Her music has kind of a luminous quality that strikes me as her own. Our understanding of American modernism of the 1930s and 1940s is not complete without Price's contribution."" Writing to a conductor in the '40s, Price described ""an accumulation of hundreds of unpublished and unsubmitted manuscripts."" She continued to compose up to her death; absent her tenacity and advocacy for her own music, her legacy was incompletely preserved and has had to be reconstructed piece by piece. But she was also meticulous, and the manuscripts that were discovered nine years ago, now in the University of Arkansas library with many of her other papers, are mostly complete and easily performed. The question is, who will perform them. Even by late last year, when challenged by a group of local musicians to diversify their programming, the Boston Symphony replied that, while it was working on the problem, audiences still wanted to hear ""specifically the universal masterworks composed between 1600 and the mid-1900s."" The orchestra had programmed music by Price some months prior, but only a string quartet in a community concert, not one of the larger symphonic pieces she created as her style matured. If American orchestras truly wish to diversify their programming -- the Chicago Symphony and Philadelphia Orchestra, to name just two important examples, recently announced seasons without music by a single female composer, living or dead -- Price is one of the many artists who deserves greater exposure. The Fort Smith Symphony in Arkansas is beginning a project to record her four symphonies for the Naxos label, based on editions prepared by the composer James Greeson, and in May will perform her First Symphony and (in a world premiere) the Fourth, another of the works unearthed in her summer house. ""While Price was quite proud of her accomplishments, she always felt like there was a limitation on the reception of her music, because of her race and because of her gender,"" Mr. Carter said. When she tried to find a publisher for her song ""Sympathy,"" set to a Dunbar poem that later inspired Maya Angelou, one told her it was just a little bit too chromatic. Mr. Carter speculates that Price identified with the caged bird in the poem. But, as we hear the soprano move into her upper register on the line ""But a plea, that upward to Heaven he flings/I know why the caged bird sings,"" we can also hear the full flowering Price has always deserved.","Florence Price, the first black woman to have her music played by a major American orchestra, is having a moment after a trove of her scores was rediscovered.",11567df8-bc02-505b-983d-97b5e6f77d18,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/11/arts/11PRICE-1/11PRICE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0b38eacb6e1b0e03ba0fb5fa1c70a0b6784e007f9f79e96c6ab3f58165319ab4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Florence Price (1887-1953) was the first black woman to have her music played by a major American orchestra.,11567df8-bc02-505b-983d-97b5e6f77d18,N24News/imgs/11567df8-bc02-505b-983d-97b5e6f77d18.jpg,12
Media,Gretchen Carlson of Fox News Files Harassment Suit Against Roger Ailes,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/07/business/media/gretchen-carlson-fox-news-roger-ailes-sexual-harassment-lawsuit.html,"Roger Ailes, the chairman of Fox News, was accused on Wednesday of forcing out a prominent female anchor after she refused his sexual advances and complained to him about persistent harassment in the newsroom, a startling accusation against perhaps the most powerful man in television news. In a lawsuit, the anchor, Gretchen Carlson, a longtime Fox employee who left the network last month, portrays Mr. Ailes as a loutish and serial sexual harasser, accusing him of ogling her in his office, calling her ""sexy,"" and describes a boys' club environment at the network. Her charges -- including the accusation that Mr. Ailes explicitly asked Ms. Carlson for a sexual relationship during a meeting in his office -- amounted to an almost unprecedented public attack on Mr. Ailes, a towering figure in media and Republican politics who typically enjoys absolute loyalty from his employees. Late Wednesday, the parent company of Fox News, 21st Century Fox, issued a measured statement, saying it had ""full confidence'' in Mr. Ailes, but had initiated an internal review of Ms. Carlson's charges. ""We take these matters seriously,"" the company said.

Mr. Ailes, in a separate statement, was far less temperate. ""Gretchen Carlson's allegations are false,"" he wrote. ""This is a retaliatory suit for the network's decision not to renew her contract,"" which he attributed to ratings he called ""disappointingly low.'' He added: ""This defamatory lawsuit is not only offensive, it is wholly without merit and will be defended vigorously.""

The suit arrives at a complex moment for Mr. Ailes, who is facing new challenges to the television empire that he has overseen, with near-total control and huge success, for two decades. While he retains the support of his corporate boss, Rupert Murdoch, Mr. Ailes, 76, has sometimes clashed with Mr. Murdoch's sons, James and Lachlan, who have ascended to the most senior leadership roles at the company.

And Fox News, while still enjoying high ratings, is facing renewed competition from CNN, which has been closing what was long an enormous gap in ratings between the networks. (In one important demographic, CNN has narrowed its deficit with Fox News to its slimmest figure in eight years.) The network has also been less of a dominant political force in this year's presidential election, with the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, publicly clashing with the network and some of its anchors, a sharp contrast from previous election cycles. Ms. Carlson, 50, filed her lawsuit in Superior Court in New Jersey, where Mr. Ailes maintains a residence. She contends that during a meeting last fall to discuss her concerns that she was being treated unfairly, Mr. Ailes told her: ""I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago and then you'd be good and better and I'd be good and better."" When she rebuffed him, the lawsuit claims, Mr. Ailes retaliated by reducing Ms. Carlson's salary, curtailing her on-air appearances and, to her surprise, declining to renew her contract last month.

* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. Ms. Carlson's suit, filed by the law firm Smith Mullin of Montclair, N.J., names Mr. Ailes as the sole defendant and seeks a variety of compensatory damages. Her lead lawyer, Nancy Erika Smith, said in an interview that Ms. Carlson's grievance was with Mr. Ailes personally, not the Fox network.

Mr. Ailes is known as a fierce public relations warrior who can be ruthless with enemies. Ms. Carlson can be self-deprecating on air, but she is working with a formidable team: Ms. Smith once brought a sexual harassment suit against a former acting governor of New Jersey, and Ms. Carlson's husband, Casey Close, is a powerful sports agent known for tenacious negotiating on behalf of clients like Derek Jeter. Ms. Smith, the lawyer, said that several women had contacted her saying they had similar experiences with Mr. Ailes, although she declined to name them. A 2014 biography of Mr. Ailes, by the journalist Gabriel Sherman, ""The Loudest Voice in the Room,'' recounted an episode in the 1980s, when Mr. Ailes was at NBC, involving a woman named Randi Harrison who said he offered her an extra $100 a week in salary in exchange for having sex with him ""whenever I want."" (Fox News denied the claim at the time; Ms. Harrison corroborated the account in a phone interview on Wednesday.) Ms. Carlson joined Fox News in 2005. In her suit, Ms. Carlson, who once walked off a Fox set as her co-anchors made jokes about women, portrays a culture at the network where casual sexism is tolerated, part of a broader Ailes news aesthetic of bombastic coverage and physically attractive talent. In 2009, Ms. Carlson contends, she complained to the network about her co-host on the popular ""Fox & Friends"" morning show, Steve Doocy, saying he belittled her on the set, openly mocked her among colleagues and once tried to shush her during a live broadcast by pulling down her arm. Mr. Ailes, the lawsuit states, responded by calling Ms. Carlson a ""man hater"" and saying ""she needed to learn to 'get along with the boys.' "" Ms. Carlson claims that because of her complaints, Mr. Ailes eventually reassigned her from ""Fox & Friends,"" in 2013, to a less prestigious slot. Until last month, Ms. Carlson was still hosting that program, ""The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson,"" which is broadcast at 2 p.m. on the network. The show had consistently won its time slot, averaging 1.1 million viewers in recent months. But it was the network's lowest-rated daytime program among a crucial advertising demographic, raising concerns at Fox News that it was losing ground to competition from CNN.","Gretchen Carlson said that after she refused sexual advances by Roger Ailes, the network chief, he curtailed her airtime and later declined to renew her contract.

Books,James Lee Burke: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/books/review/james-lee-burke-by-the-book.html," What books are on your nightstand? ""The Alchemist,"" by Paulo Coelho, and ""The Best American Mystery Stories of 2018."" Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how). My discovery of Somerset Maugham and John Steinbeck when I was 19. I learned an enormous amount from both of them. Maugham was a stylistic master at letting his characters tell stories within the story, getting around the problems inherent in a first-person point of view or third-person stream of consciousness narration. He was also extremely good at writing about the darker side of the British Empire without seeming to do so. John Steinbeck's greatest gift was his ability to tell an epic through the eyes of ordinary people. It's not coincidence that Woody Guthrie identified with Tom Joad and wrote a ballad in tribute to him and Steinbeck.

What's your favorite book of all time? ""The Sound and the Fury,"" by William Faulkner. There is no better text for a young writer, or for an old one. Which books got you hooked on crime fiction? I read ""The Amboy Dukes"" when I was 16. The author, Irving Shulman, also wrote the early treatment of ""Rebel Without a Cause."" Many representations of the 1950s are not authentic ones. Shulman got it right. It was a violent decade, Darwinian and cruel in many ways, defined by racial hatred in the North and lynchings in the South. Shulman's antecedent is James T. Farrell. I think both men were prescient about the problems we find ourselves in today. I like Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch. Michael was a crime reporter and knows his subject matter firsthand. Every detail about police work is correct. He also understands the criminal mind and pathological behavior. The prose is clean and crisp and never hyperbolic. When you read a Harry Bosch novel, you know you're in the hands of a pro. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

I think all good art involves a mysterious element. It might have been Hemingway who said that if he knew the end of a story, so would the reader. John Updike said a story should end in a way no one anticipates, but upon reaching the last sentence, the reader must feel that the story could not have ended in any other fashion. What kinds of stories are you drawn to? And what do you steer clear of? I love stories about the American West and the Beat generation and Woody Guthrie and Joe Hill and blowin' down that road with gamblers and midnight ramblers. I wish Jack Kerouac had lived to be a thousand years old. I can't take narcissistic stories that are not only cross-eyed boring but make me feel I'm being given a tour of an infected gland.

What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves? ""Jesse James,"" by T. J. Stiles, and a King James Bible from which I have been stealing material for almost six decades. Who is your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer? I think Charles Willeford's ""I Was Looking for a Street"" is one of the best books ever written about the Great Depression. He was a fine writer as well as a fine man. At the Battle of Arnhem he took his tank behind German lines and piled 23 grunts on it, and took them home. He received the Silver Star and the Croix de Guerre, and refused to talk about any of it. What kind of reader were you as a child? I loved the bookmobile. My favorite books were the Hardy Boys. When I was growing up, people did not have a lot of discretionary income, and on Thursday afternoons the arrival of the bookmobile on our dead-end street sent kids running down to the cul-de-sac to be first in line for Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys. In many ways it was a grand time to be around. The Hardy Boys. Can I sneak comics in here? Captain Marvel was unbeatable. What's the last book you recommended to a member of your family? The most recent book written by our daughter Alafair. She was reading ""Cool Hand Luke,"" by Donn Pearce, when she was 5 years old. She wrote her first short stories in the first grade. One was titled ""The Roller Rink Murder Case."" She's been at it unrelentingly ever since. What's the best book you ever received as a gift? ""Will in the World: How Shakespeare Became Shakespeare,"" by Stephen Greenblatt. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? ""New Hope for the Dead,"" by Charles Willeford. Charles used to call it his ""ultimate self-help book.""","The author, most recently, of the forthcoming Dave Robicheaux murder mystery ""The New Iberia Blues"" loves the Beat writers: ""I wish Jack Kerouac had lived to be a thousand years old.""",40f5b0c0-ddce-58dc-93b9-6162a51054b5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/30/books/review/30ByTheBook/30ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=80e185cd161070e9664e46d3d9b76ac6d72b88362d4e311e04e4b8104ab3e3a5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,James Lee Burke.,40f5b0c0-ddce-58dc-93b9-6162a51054b5,N24News/imgs/40f5b0c0-ddce-58dc-93b9-6162a51054b5.jpg,13
Opinion,Will the Coronavirus Cause a Recession?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/opinion/china-economy-coronavirus.html,"The rapid spread of the coronavirus is a tough blow for a world economy that seemed on the cusp of a modest revival. The extent of the damage, of course, depends on how soon and how effectively the outbreak is contained. Whatever the trajectory of the epidemic, this is a moment of serious reckoning for China's economy. Hard as it is to envision, the world's second-largest economy is coming to a near standstill. Infections and fatalities are mounting. Many of my acquaintances and friends in China tell me they are increasingly concerned about the government's ability to control the epidemic and its economic fallout. Big urban manufacturing and financial centers remain on at least partial lockdown, migrant laborers are unable to return to work, and factories are unable to get raw materials or ship their goods out reliably. Consumption has also been cut drastically, as people mostly stay indoors. Service industries such as tourism and restaurants are being hit especially hard. Companies in this sector, as well as small manufacturers, have been driving China's employment growth, but they tend to have little financial cushion. Beijing does have room to increase public spending, cut taxes and provide cheap credit to bolster growth. China's central bank has already taken measures to loosen monetary policy. Flooding the economy with cheap credit will increase risks to the banking system, which the government recognizes, but these are desperate times.

In any event, none of these measures will have much impact until commercial activity picks up. Moreover, China's traditional banking system has been much better at funneling credit to large, state-owned enterprises rather than to the struggling smaller private companies. China's sheer size, along with its roles as an engine of global economic growth and a dominant player in commodity markets, means that a hit to China will have significant ramifications all over the world. Oil prices have tumbled as China's growth prospects weaken and international travel, particularly to and from China, decreases. This episode will also add momentum to some changes in global supply chains that were already underway. Along with Chinese workers' rising wages and the prospects of further U.S.-China trade tensions, the epidemic is likely to cause multinational companies to reassess their supply chains and reduce their production footprints in China. The coronavirus epidemic might have only a limited immediate impact on the U.S. economy, but by creating further uncertainty and disrupting supply chains in Asia, it will add to the long list of factors likely to hold back U.S. and global growth in 2020. The temporary boost in business sentiment and investment that could have been expected from the U.S.-China trade deal last month is going to be offset by this new cloud of uncertainty over global trade. A worldwide recession is not yet on the cards but, at a minimum, the added uncertainty will restrain investment and productivity, which already looked anemic in all major economies. Another long-lasting impact is likely to be on Chinese citizens' confidence in their own government. The state and its people seem to have made an implicit bargain: good economic performance, higher living standards and the semblance of social stability in exchange for constraints on free expression, democratic rights and the free flow of information.

Yet even in an environment where it is accepted that the authorities will control what information is made public, the public grows skeptical about the competence of a government that systematically hides bad news. This issue is especially pertinent in the context of the Chinese government's initial attempts to play down the outbreak of swine flu last year. By the time the government admitted to the scale of the problem, China's pig herds had been decimated and pork prices had doubled. Now, coronavirus is spreading fast in a country that was already experiencing a slowdown from the swine flu and an outbreak of avian flu that could reduce chicken flocks. Trust in information provided by the government and its competence to manage these problems are under question, both domestically and abroad. The way the coronavirus epidemic is playing out might have lessons not just for China's government but perhaps for the United States as well. Once trust in the government and a free press are eroded by the government's desire to manipulate information, the costs can be great -- especially in difficult times, when that trust becomes crucial for maintaining confidence and stability. If history is any guide, the coronavirus will eventually come under control and the Chinese and world economies will get back on track, perhaps after a painful period. It is the effects on how people and businesses perceive their governments that might prove to be longer lasting.

Music,Boston Symphony Finds Accusations Against Charles Dutoit 'Credible',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/arts/music/boston-symphony-finds-accusations-against-charles-dutoit-credible.html,"The Boston Symphony announced Friday that four women who worked for the orchestra in the 1980s and 1990s had given its investigators credible accounts of sexual misconduct at the hands of Charles Dutoit, a frequent guest conductor.

The orchestra severed its ties with Mr. Dutoit in December, after The Associated Press reported accusations that he had sexually assaulted several women elsewhere. Boston opened an independent investigation into Mr. Dutoit after Fiona Allan, a prominent figure in British theater, accused him of having sexually assaulted her in 1997 when she was as an intern at Tanglewood, the orchestra's summer home in the Berkshires.

The orchestra said in a statement that its investigator had determined that Ms. Allan's accusations were credible. It said that the investigator had also spoken with three other women who ""credibly described incidents in the 1980s and 1990s in which they, too, were victims of sexual misconduct by Mr. Dutoit."" It did not provide any details about the other women.

Mr. Dutoit, 81, denied wrongdoing in December, issuing a statement in which he said that ""whilst informal physical contact is commonplace in the arts world as a mutual gesture of friendship, the serious accusations made involving coercion and forced physical contact have absolutely no basis in truth."" But major orchestras around the world cut ties with him, and in January he stepped down as principal conductor of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra in London nearly two years early.",An investigator looked into the cases of four women who worked for the orchestra in the 1980s and '90s and who accused Mr. Dutoit of sexual misconduct.,1e1b0712-1922-5def-a585-8ec79a8f64e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/03/arts/03dutoit-item/03dutoit-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a21fd7263553b4e6a741100edaab1de12115b768f72cb736912803da289bf3c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The conductor Charles Dutoit in 2017.

Science,'Listen to Evidence': March for Science Plans Washington Rally on Earth Day,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/01/science/march-for-science-washington-date.html,"Within a week of its creation, the March for Science campaign had attracted more than 1.3 million supporters across Facebook and Twitter, cementing itself as a voice for people who are concerned about the future of science under President Trump. Now, hoping to transform that viral success into something approaching the significance of the women's march last month, the campaign has scheduled its demonstration in Washington for Earth Day, April 22. ""Yes, this is a protest, but it's not a political protest,"" said Jonathan Berman, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio and a lead organizer of the march. ""The people making decisions are in Washington, and they are the people we are trying to reach with the message: You should listen to evidence."" Last week, Dr. Berman found himself in the middle of a social media movement. While browsing a Reddit discussion about how the new administration was handling science, he came across a comment that he interpreted as a call to arms: ""There needs to be a Scientists' March on Washington.""

""I thought someone should do that,"" Dr. Berman said, ""and I realized, I'm someone."" He proceeded to buy a web domain, design a logo and create a Twitter account for what was then called ""The Scientists' March on Washington."" Within three days, the idea had more than 700,000 supporters across its social media platforms. Other collaborators quickly joined Dr. Berman's efforts. Dr. Caroline Weinberg, a public health researcher and science writer in New York, was concerned by news reports about science at the Environmental Protection Agency. Inspired by the women's march and excited by the idea of scientists holding their own, she connected with Dr. Berman. They decided to organize a steering committee and draft a mission statement and diversity statement, but their efforts could hardly keep up with the thousands of volunteer requests and social media responses. ""While it was overwhelming, it was incredibly heartwarming that so many people were concerned with what's going on with science and this administration,"" Dr. Weinberg said. ""People were willing to donate their time and energy to this. They were just waiting for someone to set up a Twitter handle."" As the organizers address the logistical challenges of enlisting thousands of people to march on the National Mall, what they have proposed has received support from some leaders in the scientific community. ""I think it's terrific to have people standing up for science,"" said Rush D. Holt Jr., the chief executive of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, which has more than 120,000 members.

His sentiments were echoed by Christine McEntee, the chief executive of the American Geophysical Union, which has more than 60,000 members. ""This is showing that there is a large community of scientists and individuals who are supportive of science and are quite concerned about what they are hearing from this incoming administration and Congress,"" she said, ""and they want to raise their voice."" But the organizers of the march also face critical views. ""I think the average American will scratch their head and say: 'What are they marching for? What is the threat?'"" said William Happer, a physicist from Princeton University who met with Mr. Trump before his inauguration and who has been cited as a potential science adviser to the administration. Dr. Happer added that scientists could risk losing some of their public support with a large-scale protest. ""It's quite possible that this kind of public exercise could actually be bad for science -- it's like the toddler banging his spoon in the highchair,"" he said. ""It may not turn out to garner a lot of sympathy."" In the months ahead, the organizers of the march will have to contend with these and other views among scientists worrying about politicizing scientific inquiry. But Dr. Weinberg, one of the lead organizers, said she thought the public believed differently based on the response she has seen online. ""The overall tone of the current government seems to be trending in an anti-science direction,"" she said. ""That is why so many people were motivated to do something like march for science.""","Hoping to mirror the success of the women's march on Washington last month, the March for Science campaign is planning a demonstration in the capital on Earth Day, April 22.",066ab37f-26da-5ed1-9859-ff6f205b603f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/science/02march-a/02march-1485980066966-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=aba7bb99e8572595039ea108979586802c1135f332f25e77eaf8ac9a57454ff3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A women's march in Fairbanks, Alaska, last month.

Music,"Finally, a Debut for the Elbphilharmonie Hall in Hamburg",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/arts/music/elbphilharmonie-an-architectural-gift-to-gritty-hamburg-germany.html,"HAMBURG -- The escalator to the Elbphilharmonie moves at a snail's pace. That's by design. A visit to this striking new concert hall, built on top of a massive brick warehouse overlooking the harbor here, begins with a four-minute ride through a white tube sequined with thousands of reflective discs. The tube is curved, too, so the end isn't immediately visible. As you emerge onto an observation platform, a sweeping view of the Elbe River and the container port, bristling with cranes, suddenly reveals itself, a potent coup de theatre. [ An art critic weighs in on the look of the Elbphilharmonie ] The ride represents the final tease of a project that has tested this city's patience. Initial plans by the Swiss architectural firm Herzog & de Meuron were priced at 186 million euros (about $197 million), with the opening scheduled for 2010. After a succession of delays, revisions and legal disputes, the final bill for the city came to 798 million euros (about $843 million), leading to political debates and public protests. With the inaugural concert coming on Wednesday and featuring the NDR Symphony Orchestra, newly renamed the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchestra, the city hopes to prove both the cost and the wait were worth it.

""Suddenly everything is sold out,"" he said in a recent interview. Whether it's concerts by the city's resident ensembles, which also include the Hamburg State Philharmonic Orchestra and the Hamburger Symphoniker, or by visitors like the New York Philharmonic (which will perform here in April), contemporary chamber groups or jazz artists, Mr. Lieben-Seutter said that seats have been snapped up within hours of going on sale. In addition to Wednesday's concert, the opening festivities include concerts by the Chicago Symphony, under Riccardo Muti; recitals by Mitsuko Uchida and Brad Mehldau; and two performances by the German avant-garde rock band Einsturzende Neubauten (whose name translates, rather defiantly under the circumstances, as ""Collapsing New Buildings""). As he works to book the final free evenings between now and June, Mr. Lieben-Seutter has even resorted to offering tickets for ""blind dates,"" events of an unspecified genre featuring yet to be determined performers. Those, too, have sold out.

As the building's costs ballooned in 2010, Hamburg sued the construction company, and the Social Democrat opposition party in the city's senate called for an investigation into the budget increases. For several months, construction ceased altogether on parts of the hall because of repeatedly revised fire safety plans. Meanwhile, protesters in the streets and members of the city government questioned whether money was being poured into a prestige project reserved for an elite few. But while tickets to an event like this week's concert by the Chicago Symphony top out at 185 euros, the cheapest seats start at just 15 euros. And in the terraced auditorium of the Great Hall, no seat is farther than 100 feet from the conductor. Perhaps the most persuasive answer to worries about elitism is the observation deck, at the intersection of the old brick and new glass parts of the building. Free to the public and offering a 360-degree view, it has drawn half a million visitors since it opened in November.

Hamburg, an old trading city, is Germany's principal port and its second-biggest city. But in some areas it has punched below its weight: Its soccer team lags near the bottom of the Bundesliga, and few international tourists visit. In recent decades, Hamburg has marketed itself as Germany's capital of musicals, with fixtures like ""The Lion King,"" in German, presented in a theater that is reached by ferry. But the city's robust classical-music scene is still overshadowed by those of Berlin and Munich. The new hall is expected to change that by raising the standards of the ensembles that will play in its inspiring and, it is hoped, acoustically excellent interiors. And it will attract touring orchestras. The challenge remains to make the new building feel relevant to all the sectors of the city. Carsten Brosda, who heads Hamburg's culture department, said in an interview that educational outreach projects were a priority. ""Every schoolchild in Hamburg should visit the Elbphilharmonie at least once as part of their education,"" he said. The institution is also seeking to help integrate the refugees who have entered the city in great numbers over the past two years. In March the Elbphilharmonie will present a festival dedicated to Syrian music and culture that will bring together residents and new arrivals in projects including a community choir and creative workshops. Alan Gilbert, the New York Philharmonic's music director and a frequent guest conductor in Hamburg, said in a phone interview that the Elbphilharmonie's vision aligned perfectly with his own paradigm for successful 21st-century orchestras. ""It's about how they connect to the cities they serve,"" he said. ""And one condition for that is the existence of a perfectly appropriate physical space. What's going on there is related to what's potentially going to happen here in New York with the idea of redoing David Geffen Hall.""","Designed by Herzog & de Meuron atop a former cocoa warehouse, this concert hall in Germany gears up for its inaugural event on Wednesday.",223ddf28-170d-59a6-bce4-58d2a26b208a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/11/arts/11CONCERTHALL4/11CONCERTHALL4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7ca2b794294282c47e2cb6d8dc7508b22de0c077c18b3b61fd9659ed5b444684&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Elbphilharmonie in Hamburg.

Automobiles,Freeway Drones for a Futuristic Highway Patrol,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/25/automobiles/freeway-drones-for-a-futuristic-highway-patrol.html,"IT'S a future far from Ponch and Jon, the Los Angeles-based motorcycle officers of ""CHiPs,"" a TV series that rose to popularity in the 1970s. In this take on the California Highway Patrol of 2025, patrol cars and motorcycles would be replaced by computerized drones; chips take over CHiPs. Here, the highway patrol vehicles of the future will be mostly self-driving, if you accept the solutions offered by the entries in this year's Design Challenge, an annual competition organized in conjunction with the Los Angeles auto show. For the last nine years, the Design Challenge has invited automakers' advanced design studios to dream up proposals for sci-fi automotive futures tied to specific themes, including cars that weighed less than 1,000 pounds or that were destined for Hollywood roles. This year's competition asked designers to envision the highway patrol car of 2025. By coincidence or destiny, designers at several companies came up with concepts for robotic, autonomously driven vehicles on ground, water and air. These future police cruisers -- usually presented as story boards rather than actual vehicles -- recall today's Predator and Global Hawk drones, stars of the anti-insurgency efforts. They may give new meaning to those signs that read ""Speed limit enforced by aircraft.""

In the future, as the organizers outlined it, ""the vehicle should empower highway patrol officers to meet new demands and effectively both 'protect and serve' the public while considering not just enforcement needs but emission concerns, population growth and transportation infrastructure."" The world of 2025, the participants seem to agree, will be a place where traffic has grown exponentially, infrastructure has deteriorated, environmental constraints have increased -- and highway patrol budgets have been reduced.

As envisioned by Honda R&D Americas' advanced design studio in Pasadena, Calif., the future Honda CHP Drone Squad includes four-wheel Auto-Drones, like cars, and two-wheel Moto-Drones, like motorcycles. The proposal offers a future where the Auto-Drone functions as something of a command vehicle -- manned or unmanned -- that deploys Moto-Drones, even while on the move. The Moto-Drones could be rigged for a variety of different response or rescue tasks. While such vehicles might be decades from reality, the flexibility of this strategy could offer companies that built both types of vehicles an advantage in securing government contracts. At the BMW DesignworksUSA studio in Newbury Park, Calif., designers dreamed up the E-Patrol (Human-Drone Pursuit Vehicle). In this arrangement, the officer and drone would work in harmony, like today's officers and their K-9 partners. The BMW drone team would be able to deploy a flying drone, which resembles a high-tech Jet Ski cruise missile, or one of a pair of unicyclelike robotic vehicles to chase lawbreakers. And if the suspect doesn't pull over? In the E-Patrol vision, the BMW designers say, their drone would disable the vehicle with an electromagnetic impulse. The Subaru Highway Automated Response Concept vehicles, developed by Subaru Research and Development in Japan and designed specifically for Hawaii, are powered by renewable energy -- and they have aquatic capability. ""The cutting-edge SHARC patrol vehicles will provide an innovative, affordable and environmentally conscious solution for 24-hour highway monitoring,"" the designers say. The Volt Squad, dreamed up at General Motors' Advanced Design Center in North Hollywood, Calif., is a set of future patrol vehicles that would take advantage of the propulsion system engineered for the Chevrolet Volt. The squad is composed of three different types of vehicles that still contain human officers. Each type is specially designed to observe, pursue or engage -- the last term left menacingly undefined.

Judges for the Design Challenge include Tom Matano, director of the industrial design program at the Academy of Art University in San Francisco; Imre Molnar from the College for Creative Studies in Detroit; and Stewart Reed, chairman of the transportation design department at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena.

Art & Design,Gallerist Mary Boone Pleads Guilty to Filing False Tax Returns,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/arts/design/gallerist-mary-boone-pleads-guilty-to-filing-false-tax-returns.html,"Mary Boone in 2016. Lawyers for the art dealer cited the trauma of an impoverished childhood in a court filing that seeks to help her avoid prison for tax evasion.

Mary Boone, a veteran gallerist who has been a fixture in the New York art world for decades, pleaded guilty Wednesday to filing false federal income tax returns, law enforcement officials said. The Mary Boone Gallery's 2012 tax forms reported a false business loss for the previous year of about $52,000 although the gallery actually made a profit in 2011 of about $3.7 million, according to documents filed by the United States attorney's office. Ms. Boone used business funds to pay for more than $1.6 million in personal expenses, including remodeling a Manhattan apartment, and then falsely claimed those personal expenses as business deductions, prosecutors said. They added that she failed to report on her personal tax forms her profit from the gallery, instead using the bogus losses to offset what she had declared as her personal income. In a statement, Geoffrey S. Berman the United States attorney in Manhattan, described Ms. Boone as ""playing a shell game with bank accounts to hide her true assets,"" adding: ""As Boone has learned, tax laws are not abstract.""

The charges and guilty plea constituted a jarring and perhaps humbling turn of events for Ms. Boone, who over four decades running one of New York City's premier galleries has often courted attention and sometimes seemed to relish controversy. ""This is the worst day of my life,"" she wrote in an email message in response to an inquiry from The New York Times. ""I have learned from my mistake and I am working very hard to put it behind me."" Ms. Boone opened her gallery in SoHo in 1977 and rose to prominence while showing the work of artists like Julian Schnabel, David Salle, Jean-Michel Basquiat and Ross Bleckner. That male-dominated lineup drew criticism from some, including the Guerrilla Girls, an activist feminist art collective who plastered SoHo with posters denouncing Ms. Boone. In 1987, the Boone gallery began representing its first woman, Barbara Kruger. In 1999, Ms. Boone was arrested after the police were told that she was offering gallery visitors live ammunition as mementos of a one-man show by the sculptor Tom Sachs. The police seized the cartridges and a sculpture consisting of four shotguns and two pistols. After a night in jail, Ms. Boone appeared before a judge wearing a sleeveless orange dress and high-heels, and told reporters that her arrest was ""an outrageous attack"" on artists' rights. The charges against her were eventually dropped.

Then, in 2016, the actor Alec Baldwin sued Ms. Boone saying that she had deceived him by promising a painting, ""Sea and Mirror,"" by Mr. Bleckner, that had been sold at Sotheby's to a Los Angeles collector, but actually supplied him with another similar Bleckner painting, also called ""Sea and Mirror."" The case was settled last year with Ms. Boone paying Mr. Baldwin what was described at the time only as ""a seven-figure sum."" Over the years Ms. Boone, a flamboyant figure, whose assistants sometimes referred to her as ""Scary Spice,"" remained a constant in the ever-changing art world. In 1996 she moved her gallery from SoHo to Fifth Avenue and 57th Street. Four years later she opened a space in Chelsea. And she continued to champion the work of young painters and organize shows that drew respectful reviews. On Wednesday Ms. Boone pleaded guilty to two counts of filing a false federal income tax return, each of which carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison. She is scheduled to be sentenced in January. Prosecutors said that she agreed to pay restitution to the Internal Revenue Service in the amount of at least $3 million, which represents the additional tax due and owing as a result of her filing of false individual and corporate income tax returns for the calendar years 2009, 2010, and 2011.","Ms. Boone also used business funds to pay for more than $1.6 million in personal expenses, federal prosecutors said.",d85e95e9-28e0-59c1-be8a-ff4a15e38d74,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/arts/09boone/06boone-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=892668cd747e3ffbb61d1d6246978f9e56e9e0389e8974eb4656c6db386f3fb4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mary Boone in 2016.

Education,Mooresville's Shining Example (It's Not Just About the Laptops),https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/13/education/mooresville-school-district-a-laptop-success-story.html,"MOORESVILLE, N.C. -- Sixty educators from across the nation roamed the halls and ringed the rooms of East Mooresville Intermediate School, searching for the secret formula. They found it in Erin Holsinger's fifth-grade math class. There, a boy peering into his school-issued MacBook blitzed through fractions by himself, determined to reach sixth-grade work by winter. Three desks away, a girl was struggling with basic multiplication -- only 29 percent right, her screen said -- and Ms. Holsinger knelt beside her to assist. Curiosity was fed and embarrassment avoided, as teacher connected with student through emotion far more than Wi-Fi. ""This is not about the technology,"" Mark Edwards, superintendent of Mooresville Graded School District, would tell the visitors later over lunch. ""It's not about the box. It's about changing the culture of instruction -- preparing students for their future, not our past."" As debate continues over whether schools invest wisely in technology -- and whether it measurably improves student achievement -- Mooresville, a modest community about 20 miles north of Charlotte best known as home to several Nascar teams and drivers, has quietly emerged as the de facto national model of the digital school.

The district's graduation rate was 91 percent in 2011, up from 80 percent in 2008. On state tests in reading, math and science, an average of 88 percent of students across grades and subjects met proficiency standards, compared with 73 percent three years ago. Attendance is up, dropouts are down. Mooresville ranks 100th out of 115 districts in North Carolina in terms of dollars spent per student -- $7,415.89 a year -- but it is now third in test scores and second in graduation rates. ""Other districts are doing things, but what we see in Mooresville is the whole package: using the budget, innovating, using data, involvement with the community and leadership,"" said Karen Cator, a former Apple executive who is director of educational technology for the United States Department of Education. ""There are lessons to be learned."" Start with math lessons: each student's MacBook Air is leased from Apple for $215 a year, including warranty, for a total of $1 million; an additional $100,000 a year goes for software. Terry Haas, the district's chief financial officer, said the money was freed up through ""incredibly tough decisions.""

Sixty-five jobs were eliminated, including 37 teachers, which resulted in larger class sizes -- in middle schools, it is 30 instead of 18 -- but district officials say they can be more efficiently managed because of the technology. Some costly items had become obsolete (like computer labs), though getting rid of others tested the willingness of teachers to embrace the new day: who needs globes in the age of Google Earth? Families pay $50 a year to subsidize computer repairs, though the fee is waived for those who cannot afford it, about 18 percent of them. Similarly, the district has negotiated a deal so that those without broadband Internet access can buy it for $9.99 a month. Mr. Edwards said the technology had helped close racial performance gaps in a district where 27 percent of the students are minorities and 40 percent are poor enough to receive free or reduced-price lunches.

""Even in the downturn, we're a seller's market -- people want to buy homes here,"" said Kent Temple, a real estate agent in town. ""Families say, 'This is a chance for my child to compete with families that have more money than me.' Six years from now, you'll see how many from disadvantaged backgrounds go to college and make it."" Mooresville's laptops perform the same tasks as those in hundreds of other districts: they correct worksheets, assemble progress data for teachers, allow for compelling multimedia lessons, and let students work at their own pace or in groups, rather than all listening to one teacher. The difference, teachers and administrators here said, is that they value computers not for the newest content they can deliver, but for how they tap into the oldest of student emotions -- curiosity, boredom, embarrassment, angst -- and help educators deliver what only people can. Technology, here, is cold used to warm. Mooresville frequently tests students in various subjects to inform teachers where each needs help. Every quarter, department heads and principals present summary data to Mr. Edwards, who uses it to assess where teachers need improvement. Special emphasis goes to identifying students who are only a few correct answers away from passing state proficiency standards. They are then told how close they are and, Mr. Edwards said, ""You can, you can, you can."" Many classrooms have moved from lecture to lattice, where students collaborate in small groups with the teacher swooping in for consultation. Rather than tell her 11th-grade English students the definition of transcendentalism one recent day, Katheryn Higgins had them crowd-source their own -- quite Thoreauly, it turned out -- using Google Docs. Back in September, Ms. Higgins had the more outgoing students make presentations on the Declaration of Independence, while shy ones discussed it in an online chat room, which she monitored.

In math, students used individualized software modules, with teachers stopping by occasionally to answer questions. (""It's like having a personal tutor,"" said Ethan Jones, the fifth grader zooming toward sixth-grade material.) Teachers apportion their time based on the need of students, without the weaker ones having to struggle at the blackboard in front of the class; this dynamic has helped children with learning disabilities to participate and succeed in mainstream classes. ""There are students who might not have graduated five years ago who have graduated,"" said Melody Morrison, a case manager for Mooresville High School's special education programs. ""They're not just our kids anymore. They're everybody's kids -- all teachers throughout the school. The digital conversion has evened the playing field."" Many students adapted to the overhaul more easily than their teachers, some of whom resented having beloved tools -- scripted lectures, printed textbooks and a predictable flow through the curriculum -- vanish. The layoffs in 2009 and 2010, of about 10 percent of the district's teachers, helped weed out the most reluctant, Mr. Edwards said; others he was able to convince that the technology would actually allow for more personal and enjoyable interaction with students. ""You have to trust kids more than you've ever trusted them,"" he said. ""Your teachers have to be willing to give up control.""

Thomas Bertrand, superintendent of schools in Rochester, Ill., said he was struck by the ""culture of collaboration among staff and kids"" in Mooresville and would emphasize that as his district considered its own conversion. ""There's a tendency in teaching to try to control things, like a parent,"" said Scott Allen, a high school chemistry teacher in South Granville, N.C. ""But I learn best at my own pace, and you have to realize that students learn best at their own pace, too."" Mooresville still has some growing pains. In one ninth-grade social studies class, a video that easily could have been shown on a large screen instead went through the students' laptops, several of which balked, ""Unable to find proxy server."" One fourth grader, having to complete 10 multiplication questions in two minutes for the software to let her move on, simply consulted her times tables, making the lesson more about speed typing than mathematics. And those concerned about corporate encroachment on public schools would blanch at the number of Apple logos in the hallways, and at the district's unofficial slogan: ""iBelieve, iCan, iWill."" Mooresville's tremendous focus on one data point -- the percentage of students passing proficiency exams -- has its pitfalls as well. At November's quarterly data meeting, there were kudos for several numbers whose rise or dip was not statistically significant, and no recognition that the students who passed by one or two questions could very well fail by one or two the next time around. Several colorful pie charts used metrics that were meaningless. ""I realize the fallacy of looking at one measure,"" Mr. Edwards said in an interview afterward. ""We look at scholarships, A.P. courses taken, honors courses, SAT scores. But the measure that we use is what the state posts, and what parents look at when they're comparing schools moving here."" After three years of computers permeating every area of their schooling, Mooresville students barely remember life before the transformation and are somewhat puzzled by the gaggle of visitors who watch them every month. (""At times it's kind of like being a lab rat,"" one 11th grader said.) But Mooresville understands its growing fame in the world of education, much of which has yet to find the balance between old tricks and new technology.","A North Carolina school district has quietly emerged as a model digital school, with thousands of laptops issued to students and test scores up across the board.",e6ffe86d-6c82-517d-a657-d33b7e0c53f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/13/us/MOORESVILLE-4/MOORESVILLE-4-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=340&w=600&s=6414d6739f8298f35a9c1654f7d3b204a099997a45b1ca82ec822912293db0cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"CONNECTING Tammy Rigby, a fifth-grade science teacher at East Mooresville Intermediate, helping Grace Lateef, left, and Caitlyn Yaede with a class exercise.",e6ffe86d-6c82-517d-a657-d33b7e0c53f3,N24News/imgs/e6ffe86d-6c82-517d-a657-d33b7e0c53f3.jpg,22
Books,Karin Slaughter: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/books/review/karin-slaughter-by-the-book.html," What books are on your nightstand? A galley of Lee Child's upcoming ""Past Tense""; ""The Death of Democracy: Hitler's Rise to Power and the Downfall of the Weimar Republic,"" by Benjamin Carter Hett; ""The Lost Life of Eva Braun,"" by Angela Lambert; ""Circe,"" by Madeline Miller; ""So Close to Being the Sh*t, Y'all Don't Even Know,"" by Retta; ""Less,"" by Andrew Sean Greer; ""Atticus Finch: The Biography,"" by Joseph Crespino. Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how). Atlanta is razor-hot right now, so I blast the air-conditioner in my office for pretend winter, snuggle under a blanket with my cat, Dexter, and make sure the reading lamp is on high, because for some crazy reason the words on the page look tinier without light. Maybe it's because of global warming, because I'm too young for that crap. What's your favorite book of all time? This is complicated because ""Gone With the Wind"" exists as one of the main pillars of the odious Lost Cause narrative, but it's also one of the pivotal books I read in childhood that helped shape me as a writer. When I came across it in the library, there were not a lot of novels where women were allowed to be confident and commanding without being violently murdered by the end of the story.

Which books got you hooked on crime fiction? I discovered Sue Grafton's Kinsey Millhone series in my teens and found them to be inspiring as well as an excellent counterbalance to my headier teen reading: ""Flowers in the Attic,"" by V. C. Andrews, and ""Lace,"" by Shirley Conran. Who's your favorite fictional detective? And the best villain? Sara Paretsky's V. I. Warshawski kicked butt well before it was acceptable for ladies to do that kind of thing. There's an entire generation of women writing strong women because of Sara. For villains, I'd have to say Mayella Ewell from ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" though with some reservations. On one hand, she was horribly abused by her father; on the other, she contributes to the spurious apologue of the vindictive woman who uses false rape allegations to strike out at a man. Character has to matter as much as plot. If they're not equally strong, then no one really cares what happens. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

What kinds of stories are you drawn to? And what do you steer clear of? I'll read anything -- nonfiction, true crime, historical fiction. As long as it's well told, I'm there. While I enjoy a lot of science fiction, when it gets into the nitty gritty of the tensile strength of the titanium cables threaded into the wings of the automatovelociraptor, you've lost me. What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves? People are always surprised that I read a lot of history, but I feel that good crime fiction holds a mirror up to society and tells readers what's going on in the world. You can't do that effectively without understanding history.

Who is your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer? Clare Chambers (""Learning to Swim,"" ""The Editor's Wife"") is an English author who's fantastic at writing about crazy, eclectic families. What keeps Clare from being the English Anne Tyler is there's always someone who is acutely aware of not quite fitting in. There's something heartbreaking about the fact that most people who are unusual only ever long to be normal. What kind of reader were you as a child? Insatiable -- though to be honest there were lots of reading contests in my school, and I'm incredibly competitive, so perhaps my early reading passion came from wanting to humiliate my closest reading rivals by volume. I loved Encyclopedia Brown and aspired to be him, which endeared me to exactly no one in my family (he's clearly overeducated for his intelligence). There's been a lot of chatter about Sally Kimball's place in the Brown canon because she was sometimes ""allowed"" to contribute to the crime-solving, but she was arguably a violent bully. Thank God she was also the prettiest girl in school; otherwise, they would have beaten the hell out of her every day. What's the last book you recommended to a member of your family? ""Grief Is the Thing With Feathers,"" by Max Porter. It's part bereavement counselor, part anger management. What's the best book you ever received as a gift? ""Slammerkin,"" by Emma Donoghue, was given to me a few birthdays ago. I was going on and on about ""The Crimson Petal and the White,"" by Michel Faber, and a friend said, ""This will knock the breath out of you."" He was right. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? ""The Giving Tree,"" by Shel Silverstein, about a Low-IQ Tree that lets a WEAK kid take Everything starting with all of his big, beautiful Apples and, the tree is so Pathetic, because he used to be the strongest tree but now the World is laughing at him. What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing?

""Orlando,"" by Virginia Woolf, answers both of those questions. Good God, even two lifetimes is not enough to grit through the pages. If you were to write something besides thrillers, what would you write? The terrific gift about thriller-writing today is that the books can exist as hybrids. In some iteration, I've written love stories, polemics, historical novels, family sagas ... The fact that people are murdered and the reader is told why slots me into the thriller category, and I'm absolutely fine with that. I have always loved thrillers -- you can get away with anything in them. Whom would you choose to write your life story? I want to say Alafair Burke because she would make the truth interesting, but then I know she'd tell the truth. So maybe James Patterson, because I think my life lends itself to short, pacey chapters. If you could meet any writer, dead or alive, who would it be? What would you want to know? Flannery O'Connor has always fascinated me. Growing up in a small town with weird thoughts and being constantly told that it wasn't ladylike to write dark stories and that I'd never make much of myself if I didn't learn how to blend in, it was stunning (and gratifying) to find an example of a woman from a small town with weird thoughts writing dark stories who was celebrated throughout the world. What I'd want to ask her is which stories came from happiness and which came from sadness, because only she would know. What book do you think everybody should read? ""Ethan Frome,"" by Edith Wharton, though any Wharton will do. She embodied the dictum that the difference between a painter and an artist is that an artist knows when to stop painting. What do you plan to read next? ""Masterless Men: Poor Whites and Slavery in the Antebellum South,"" by Keri Leigh Merritt. I read an interview with the author a few months ago and was intrigued by the scope of her work. I've lived in the South my entire life and I love it here, but I am acutely aware that people who think they pulled themselves up by their own bootstraps often forget that someone had to make the boots.","The novelist Karin Slaughter, whose thriller ""Pieces of Her"" will be published in August, says school contests made her an insatiable reader: ""I'm incredibly competitive, so perhaps my early reading passion came from wanting to humiliate my closest reading rivals by volume.""",a384d1e1-33cd-55ef-898f-547985cbd2f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/22/books/review/22ByTheBook/22ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=27fe9c5d62772ac178bbf4576754242f09c4e65ad4a0c6c792d1d978706a34f7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Karin Slaughter,a384d1e1-33cd-55ef-898f-547985cbd2f9,N24News/imgs/a384d1e1-33cd-55ef-898f-547985cbd2f9.jpg,13
Sports,Mets Name Luis Rojas Manager After Beltran's Ouster,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/22/sports/baseball/mets-luis-rojas-manager.html,"When Luis Rojas reported to spring training with the Mets last year, he was the first quality control coach in the team's history. His many responsibilities included on-field coaching, like helping the utility man Jeff McNeil on his transition to the outfield, as well as streamlining how the front office communicated analytics information to the players. ""I am going to be that source that brings in the information to our coaching staff and to our players,"" he said one day at the team's facility in Port St. Lucie, Fla. The job was another step on a steady rise through the Mets organization for Rojas. On Wednesday he took another big, unexpected leap when Mets General Manager Brodie Van Wagenen said the team was making Rojas its next manager. ""I think it's the fit,"" Van Wagenen told reporters. ""It's where the team is. I think it's the culture we're trying to create.""

The move came in the middle of a tumultuous off-season for the Mets. They fired Manager Mickey Callaway in October after his second season in charge and hired Carlos Beltran, a highly respected former player with no previous managing experience, as his replacement a month later.

Last week he agreed to part ways with the team after Major League Baseball implicated him in the sign-stealing operation employed by the Houston Astros in 2017, when he was an outfielder with that club. Beltran, who played 20 seasons in the major leagues and helped the Astros win the 2017 World Series, was the only player implicated by name in M.L.B.'s report on the cheating scheme. After multiple meetings with Van Wagenen and the team's chief operating officer, Jeff Wilpon, last week after the report was released, Beltran and the team decided it would be best for Beltran to step down. Enter Rojas, who was born in the Dominican Republic and has been in the organization for more than a decade after a short playing career in the minor leagues. His family has a long history in the major leagues: His father, Felipe Alou, was one of the first M.L.B. players from the Dominican Republic and had a 17-year playing career before spending 14 seasons as a big-league manager. Felipe Alou's brothers, Matty and Jesus, also played in the majors, and his son Moises Alou -- Rojas's brother -- spent the final two years of his 17-season career with the Mets. Rojas, 38, played only at the minor league level before working his way up with the Mets. He was a manager for eight years in the minor leagues before jumping to the majors last season as part of Callaway's coaching staff.

Players commended him for his attention to detail, and he could often be seen working with outfielders hours before the first pitch at otherwise empty stadiums. In the clubhouse, he was often seen consulting with players before and after games. Rojas offers the organization some continuity amid the disruption, and he is familiar with the talent in the clubhouse. He managed the Class AA Binghamton Rumble Ponies, where he oversaw the development of the current major leaguers Pete Alonso and McNeil. Before that, he managed in Class A, as well as in the winter league in the Dominican Republic. On Twitter Wednesday, Alonso, who broke the rookie record with 53 home runs last season, wrote that he was ""super pumped"" to have Rojas as his new boss. Starting pitcher Marcus Stroman, whom the Mets acquired in a trade at the deadline last season, also weighed in on Twitter, writing that Rojas was ""Super laid back and brings nothing but great vibes each and every day. Beyond even keel. Excited even more for the year!"" Rojas was the manager of the Binghamton Rumble Ponies in Class AA in 2018. When the team dismissed Callaway, Wilpon and Van Wagenen cited the team's failure to reach the postseason as the reasoning for their decision. While Jacob deGrom, the team's ace, won his second consecutive Cy Young Award and Alonso was named the National League's rookie of the year, the Mets finished in third place in the National League East, their late-season surge proving to be insufficient to make the postseason. The Washington Nationals, who finished seven games ahead of the Mets and second in the division, went on to win the World Series.","Rojas, who has spent more than a decade in the organization, was the Mets' quality control coach last season.

Automobiles,Fuel Cells at Center Stage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/automobiles/fuel-cells-at-center-stage.html,"BERKELEY, CALIF. -- Like thick-rim glasses, Doc Martens and so many other things that fell out of favor only to spring back to popularity years later, fuel-cell cars have resurfaced. In Tokyo on Wednesday, Toyota was the first automaker in the new season of international auto shows to reveal its fresh take on this headline-grabbing technology, quickly followed by Honda and Hyundai in Los Angeles. All three automakers unveiled new design studies intended to signal that fuel-cell vehicles, which produce zero tailpipe pollutants, are ever so close to production. Each concept vehicle demonstrated progress in the efficiency and packaging of their fuel-cell systems, which generate electricity onboard by combining hydrogen and oxygen and emit only water vapor. What these automakers failed to deliver in terms of specifics they offset with lofty promises of a real and rapidly approaching hydrogen-based future. Before you file this news with reports of the imminent arrival of flying cars, consider this: For the last four months, I have been living with fuel-cell technology, logging more than 2,500 miles at the wheel of a Toyota Highlander FCHV-adv test bed. And I took two short test drives of a sedan that the company said would be ready for volume production in about 24 months.

The all-electric Toyota technowonder that visited my driveway was based on a 2008 Highlander midsize crossover. It offered nearly 300 miles of driving range and five-minute fill-ups -- a combination that no battery-electric car offers. I drove for days without tailpipe emissions and without depleting the tank. Multiple round-trip journeys from my East Bay home to San Jose or Sacramento were no problem. Those trips are a challenge for the Nissan Leaf E.V. that I usually drive, which offers 80 miles of real-world range and charging times measured in hours. ""Toyota made a decision -- the fuel-cell car is going to be a big part of our future,"" John Hanson, a Toyota spokesman, said. ""That's the direction we're going, big time."" Toyota is not alone. Four other carmakers -- General Motors, Hyundai, Honda and Mercedes-Benz -- are also promising fuel-cell cars in the next few years. They must satisfy California's zero emission laws, essentially requiring that by 2025 about 15 percent of new cars refuel by plugging into the grid or filling up with hydrogen.

My first visits to the station, on the block where Pixar makes movies, were a scene you'd expect from one of the studio's hapless characters. Even after training, my first tries ended with the heavy connector being ejected and falling to the pavement. That was user error; soon enough, I figured out the problem, and topping up with hydrogen gas became routine. A kilogram, or 2.2 pounds, of hydrogen contains nearly the same amount of energy as a gallon of gasoline. To top up, I added about 4 to 5 kilograms of gaseous hydrogen into tanks at a pressure of 10,000 pounds per square inch. The Highlander traveled about 55 miles on a kilogram. In Emeryville, I paid $12 to $13 a kilogram. Measured against a baseline of a 2008 Highlander Hybrid, which carried an E.P.A. rating of 27 m.p.g. in the city and 25 on the highway, that's roughly equivalent to paying $6 for a gallon of gasoline. According to Toyota, full-scale production of hydrogen is projected to drop the cost below the current price of gasoline, but for now E.V.'s that charge from the grid and store the energy in a lithium-ion battery pack operate at a cost-per-mile expense that's commonly one-third that of filling up a fuel-cell vehicle with hydrogen. Some aspects of the 2008 fuel-cell Highlander are by now outdated, so Toyota gave me two turns, once in May and again in September, in a test vehicle that it says is more representative of the sedan it will offer in 2015. This mule, which had its fuel-cell powertrain installed in the body of a Lexus HS 250h -- a hybrid model that has been discontinued -- used zip ties and gaffer's tape to hold together prototype parts and diagnostic equipment. But it gave a sportier drive than the Highlander. The production car will carry a Toyota badge. All electric cars, whether drawing their energy from batteries or fuel cells, offer impressive low-speed response and near-silent operation. An unexpected exception in a fuel-cell car is the hiss of an air compressor, which pumps oxygen from the atmosphere to the fuel cell. The main challenge facing Toyota engineers, however, is the vehicle's price. ""The effort to bring this car to market is about lowering the cost, while providing satisfactory performance,"" said Matt McClory, principal engineer of fuel cell vehicle development for Toyota in the United States, as we did a test drive around Torrance, Calif. ""Bringing the costs down was the biggest bogey.""

Toyota executives say they believe a target price around $50,000 is needed to make the cars attractive. That might require the company to price the cars below cost until production reaches a profitable level. As part of the effort to reduce costs in the 2015 car, Toyota engineers are using a motor and power electronics borrowed from the company's hybrids. The cost of the fuel-cell unit, known as the stack, was cut by reducing the amount of platinum catalyst it needed -- and it was made smaller to fit it under the front seats. The number of tanks was reduced to two in the coming sedan model, from four in the converted Highlander.

The drives in the sedan mule did not alter my view of Toyota's reputation for emphasizing familiarity over driving excitement. It raised the question of whether such a sedate vehicle, limited to sparse and expensive fueling options, would justify its hefty price. Marketing will be tricky; it may be necessary to address the safety concerns of consumers. The hydrogen is stored in very durable tanks, and in the extremely unlikely event of a puncture, the gas quickly dissipates into the air, as opposed to liquid fuel that can pool on roadways. By the time Toyota sells its first fuel-cell sedan, there will be about a half-million plug-in vehicles on the road in the United States -- and tens of thousands of E.V. charging stations. At the same time, it's uncertain how many hydrogen stations will be online in California by the end of 2015, even with a new source of infrastructure financing. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed Assembly Bill 8. It includes $20 million a year for up to 10 years, with the goal of building about 100 new stations over the coming decade. The economics are questionable. Each station costs from $1 million to $3 million, depending on whether hydrogen is produced on the site. The hydrogen used in transportation mostly comes from steam reformation of natural gas. Outside Southern California, which has underground pipes, hydrogen is trucked in liquid form to stations.","Toyota, General Motors, Hyundai, Honda and Mercedes-Benz are promising to sell fuel-cell cars in the next few years, making it clear that hydrogen will be part of their future.",39d2e9cc-e140-5396-95d4-279851d9edfb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/24/automobiles/subHYDROGEN1/subHYDROGEN1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=312&w=600&s=97cb88ac895b1445f679d985270941f462939c54ba6fec217963691db0675e2f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Toyota FCV Concept was introduced at the Tokyo Motor Show on Wednesday.,39d2e9cc-e140-5396-95d4-279851d9edfb,N24News/imgs/39d2e9cc-e140-5396-95d4-279851d9edfb.jpg,23

Travel,"At Amsterdam's Rijksmuseum, Art on the Plate",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/travel/amsterdam-restaurant-rijksmuseum.html,"Apart from a couple of brass weather vanes, there is no art on the walls of Rijks, the principal restaurant at the Rijksmuseum, the cultural institution in Amsterdam that reopened in 2013 after a decade-long renovation. Perhaps that's for the best: After long hours of scrutinizing Rembrandts and Vermeers, it's relaxing to enter an old-master-free zone for lunch, dinner or a midafternoon pause.

That said, the gnarl of driftwood and foliage set on our table before the beginning of our meal rose almost to the level of art. The leaves, however, turned out to be a snack: crisp tempura-fried spinach dusted with a tart seasoning mix. (The driftwood was whisked away before we could hazard a taste with our first glass of wine -- Dutch wine, no less.)

The restaurant offers a tempting six-course tasting, but we chose our own meal a la carte with enthusiastic and well-informed advice from a waiter. The menu, by the executive chef Joris Bijdendijk, is almost equally divided among seafood, meat and vegetables. Ingredients are excellent, local and seasonal, and the cooking is precise and imaginative in both flavor and technique, yielding delicious, satisfying, sometimes intriguing dishes.

When we visited earlier this year, a good example was spit-roasted celeriac, which was fetched from the kitchen on a board and carved and sauced at the table. The consistency was creamy and the flavor intense, but there were layers to this dish: The celeriac was steamed, then studded with Dutch-cured smoked pork lardo and slowly roasted and basted for hours. It was served with a smoked-oyster emulsion and a rich veal gravy and topped with red sorrel leaves. All those elements were there to support the vegetable, which remained the center of attention.",The cooking at Rijks is precise and imaginative in both flavor and technique.,10f37155-daf9-5681-88ba-a26b9429ffdc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/01/travel/01BITES/01BITES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=d359bff01f58d4b0f50a4887c6efca81ce031337696ae9c3770afebb7769c4dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Roasted langoustine tail with curry cream, trout eggs and quinoa.",10f37155-daf9-5681-88ba-a26b9429ffdc,N24News/imgs/10f37155-daf9-5681-88ba-a26b9429ffdc.jpg,4
Education,"Anyone Can Be a Teacher at Skillshare, an Online School",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/20/education/anyone-can-be-a-teacher-in-this-online-school.html,"Susan Orlean was considering giving up teaching. She had taught courses at New York University and at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference at Middlebury College but was finding it difficult to maintain a consistent class schedule while fulfilling her obligations as a staff writer for The New Yorker. ""I just started thinking, well, maybe there's a different way to do this that doesn't tie me to a physical location,"" she said. ""And right around that time, Skillshare contacted me."" Skillshare is an online video platform that allows anyone to sign up and teach a class. The company has proved adept at recruiting experts to teach on its website. Aside from Ms. Orlean's class on creative nonfiction, the website has a class on visual storytelling from the design maven Debbie Millman and a marketing course taught by the entrepreneur Seth Godin. At one point, it even offered screenwriting instruction from James Franco. The company's business model does not depend solely on experts. Instead, those behind the service are banking on the idea that amateurs will be inspired to share their knowledge online. They envision the website as a kind of educational YouTube: If you want to teach anyone anything -- how to use Photoshop, or even how to chug a beer more efficiently -- Skillshare wants to host your classes. Many users find that appealing. Since the platform was opened last September, the number of courses offered has nearly doubled to about 1,000. Skillshare has raised more than $10 million in venture capital.

Students pay $10 a month for unlimited access to Skillshare courses, and 850,000 are signed up, the company says. Frequently, thousands will sign up for a single course. Jake Bartlett, a freelance motion-graphics artist who teaches digital visual effects, says about 1,200 students signed up for his latest course. Nearly 2,000 students are enrolled in Ms. Millman's visual storytelling class, her first on the site. Teachers with at least 25 students can enter a ""partner program"" in which they are paid based on the number of subscribing students in their classes, and for projects those students submit. Skillshare says that on average, teachers in the program are paid $3,500 annually. Those with fewer than 25 students are not paid. Skillshare, which is based in New York, was developed in 2011 as an offline enterprise, a form of alternative education that would teach practical skills to students in local communities. But the legwork involved was taxing, so in the summer of 2012 the company moved online. Last fall, it opened to anybody who wanted to teach a course. The company's chief executive, Michael Karnjanaprakorn, said that opening the platform was essential in addressing how teaching and learning work online. ""The Internet is like this virtual town getting built,"" he said. ""Let's say The New York Times is the newspaper, Twitter is a short form of communication, Facebook is a town center and AOL built the roads. What we think is getting built right now is the hospital and the school. And in order for those things to be built, they have to keep in mind how the Internet works.""

He said building the Internet's school meant letting users determine the courses they want to teach and take without creating many financial obstacles. The way Skillshare accommodates its students academically and financially sets it apart from its online competitors. Companies like Coursera and Udacity prepare students for the work force in a more familiar fashion. For the most part, Coursera hews closely to traditional college courses, and Udacity offers ""nanodegrees"" for digital skills that will appeal to prospective employers in the technology sector. Even Udemy, an online education platform that is also open to anyone who wants to teach, allows instructors to set prices, which can make enrollment in multiple courses difficult for students on a budget. Most of the subjects that Skillshare offers resemble the abilities someone might pick up after spending a couple of semesters in the company of art school students. Colleen Sullivan Leh, 46, a graphic designer in Lake Orion, Mich., has subscribed to Skillshare for about a year and has taken classes on typography and photography. She said she liked being able to set her own pace without being evaluated. ""It works for me because there are no grades involved,"" she said. Because it does not field more traditional classes or award grades or credentials, Skillshare is vulnerable to criticism that it masquerades as a learning platform while it wastes users' time and money. But those who have taken issue with other forms of ""edutainment"" are more accepting of a platform that teaches practical skills. Nathan Jurgenson, a graduate student in sociology at the University of Maryland and a specialist in Internet culture, sees Skillshare as a ""stopgap measure,"" necessary to an economy in which skills can be more valuable than diplomas. ""It's far more suited to our economy than going to a graduate program,"" he said. ""What Skillshare is doing is more in line with what our precarious work force needs."" Many instructors, including Ms. Millman and Ms. Orlean, emphasized that Skillshare was not a replacement for traditional education, but more of a complementary way to learn.","Students pay $10 a month for unlimited access to Skillshare's 1,000 courses, and 850,000 users are signed up with the service, the company said.",34994a88-ee9b-54da-a250-bc92b2fadb91,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/20/education/20TUBE1/20TUBE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=9598275c9e2f3ddcacaf7cfd64ea83e0757b872a0952696cbcbc273b012f9cb4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Skillshare staff at work at the company's offices in New York.

Sports,Astros Manager and G.M. Fired Over Cheating Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/sports/baseball/astros-cheating.html,"It is an enduring part of baseball strategy: As a batter is at the plate, his teammates carefully watch a catcher's fingers to figure out what pitch is about to be thrown. And it's all fair play as long as teams do not enhance the abilities of the naked eye and clever minds with either cameras or electronic devices that allow teammates to signal the batter whether a fastball or a breaking ball is on the way. But that is exactly what the Houston Astros did during their 2017 championship-winning season, clouding that World Series title and causing one of baseball's biggest cheating scandals in years, Major League Baseball officials said on Monday in a scathing report detailing the team's scheme. By the end of the day, Houston General Manager Jeff Luhnow and Manager A.J. Hinch -- the two men who helped propel the Astros to the top of the sport -- had been suspended and then fired, while their club was left with severe penalties for deploying a scheme involving cameras and monitors to decode the hand signals of catchers and tip off Houston batters. One of their favorite communication methods was banging on a trash can just outside the dugout.

[A look at sign stealing and what we know about the Houston Astros' scandal] Commissioner Robert D. Manfred of Major League Baseball said in the report, which was written in a first person voice, that the league could not determine whether the Astros had changed the results of any games by cheating. But, he said, ""the perception of some that it did causes significant harm to the game."" And so M.L.B. acted, issuing one of the heaviest punishments in the history of the sport. Mr. Manfred's report, which concluded an investigation that involved at least 68 interviews and thousands of videos and documents, excoriated the Astros' baseball operations department -- including how they treated employees, other clubs and the news media -- as ""very problematic."" [Exploiting technology helped the Astros rise, but also did them in, Tyler Kepner writes] The punishments drew mixed reactions from around the baseball world. Many sympathized with the Los Angeles Dodgers, who lost the 2017 World Series to the Astros (led by Mr. Hinch) and the Boston Red Sox (led by the former Astros bench coach Alex Cora) in 2018. ""Didn't really expect the punishments to be this harsh. Good for M.L.B. stepping up,"" David Freese, who played on the 2018 Dodgers team, wrote in a tweet. The commissioner also noted in his report an incident during the 2019 postseason in which the Astros' assistant general manager, Brandon Taubman, loudly celebrated a pitcher who had been suspended from the game for a violation of the M.L.B. domestic violence policy. A group of female reporters were nearby in the team's clubhouse when Mr. Taubman lauded the pitcher.

Jim Crane, the Astros' owner and chairman, was largely spared in the report. And at a news conference announcing the firings soon after M.L.B. released its report, he said: ""We will not have this happen again on my watch. We need to move forward with a clean slate."" The Astros were accused of violating the rules during the 2017 and 2018 seasons, the first of which was when they won their first World Series title and were praised as a paradigm-shifting power in the baseball landscape. The team's heavy focus on analytics earned the nickname ""Astroball,"" and Mr. Luhnow's strategies helped transform the team from a perennial loser to a championship-winning club.

The dismissal of Mr. Luhnow and Mr. Hinch came shortly after M.L.B. said that they would be suspended for the 2020 season and that the club would be fined $5 million, the maximum penalty allowed under league rules, while also losing first- and second-round draft picks in 2020 and 2021. ""Neither one of them started this, but neither one of them did anything about it,"" Mr. Crane said of Mr. Luhnow and Mr. Hinch, who were both once acclaimed as progressive strategists in a staid sport but now find themselves barred from the game until the end of the 2020 World Series. Mr. Luhnow, who joined the Astros in 2011 after a stint with the St. Louis Cardinals and a career as an engineer and management consultant that included five years at the consulting firm McKinsey and Company, issued a written statement on Monday apologizing for the ""shame and embarrassment this has caused."" He added: ""I did not know rules were being broken.""

Mr. Hinch, who was hired by the Astros after the 2014 season, did the same on Monday: ""While the evidence consistently showed I didn't endorse or participate in the sign stealing practices, I failed to stop them and I am deeply sorry."" Despite the heavy punishment and damning details of the Astros' scheme, their title will not be vacated, though the scandal could have further repercussions as Mr. Cora, the Red Sox manager, was heavily implicated for his role while he was a bench coach for the Astros in 2017. ""While it is impossible to determine whether the conduct actually impacted the results on the field, the perception of some that it did causes significant harm to the game,"" Mr. Manfred wrote. The explosion of technology in the sport and M.L.B.'s expansion of replay review in 2014 have added a new dynamic to the sign-stealing practice, allowing some teams to consistently stay one step ahead of the rule. In September 2017, all teams were put on notice by M.L.B. after it found that the Red Sox had been sending information about opposing teams' signs from their replay review room to people in the dugout wearing Apple watches. The Red Sox were fined -- as were the Yankees, who turned in their rival, for a lesser misuse of the dugout phone -- and Mr. Manfred sent a memo to teams detailing the potential punishment for managers and general managers for future violations of the rules governing the use of electronic equipment. But the Astros brazenly continued their practice, Mr. Manfred's report said. M.L.B.'s investigation found that the Astros violated those rules through the 2017 playoffs and for at least part of the 2018 season.

A more detailed scheme, first detailed in a report by The Athletic in November, began two months into the 2017 season by Mr. Cora and several players, including Carlos Beltran, who was hired this off-season as the Mets' manager. Mr. Cora arranged for a monitor displaying the center-field camera footage to be installed next to the Astros' dugout. At least one player would decode the opposing team's signs, and when the catcher issued a sign, the upcoming pitch would be relayed to the batter with a sound -- most often the slamming of a baseball bat on a nearby trash can. Mr. Manfred's report said that most of the non-pitching players on the 2017 Astros team had participated in the cheating operation, and that many of those interviewed admitted they knew the scheme was wrong. ""Players stated that if Manager A.J. Hinch told them to stop engaging in the conduct, they would have immediately stopped,"" the report said. Mr. Manfred chose to punish Mr. Luhnow and Mr. Hinch, rather than the players, because of his previous warning in 2017 that senior team officials would be held accountable for electronic sign-stealing. ""It is difficult because virtually all of the Astros' players had some involvement or knowledge of the scheme, and I am not in a position based on the investigative record to determine with any degree of certainty every player who should be held accountable, or their relative degree of culpability,"" Mr. Manfred wrote. Mr. Manfred's report said that Mr. Hinch had disapproved of the scheme, and had twice damaged the monitor near the dugout in an attempt to thwart it, but that he did not tell his players or Mr. Cora to stop it. ""Although I appreciate Hinch's remorsefulness, I must hold him accountable for the conduct of his team, particularly since he had full knowledge of the conduct,"" Mr. Manfred wrote. Although Mr. Luhnow denied any knowledge of the schemes, the report cited ""documentary and testimonial evidence that indicates Luhnow had some knowledge,"" including at least two emails, of the sign-stealing efforts.

""Luhnow failed to take any adequate steps to ensure that his club was in compliance with the rules,"" Mr. Manfred wrote, then referring to the 2017 Red Sox incident. As far as the ""lower-level Astros employees"" who were aware of and participated in the sign-stealing, Mr. Manfred wrote that he would defer decisions about punishment to the Astros, and Mr. Crane said the team was still reviewing that matter. After nearly 80 interviews by M.L.B.'s investigation department during its inquiries into the sign-stealing scandal and Mr. Taubman's outburst, Mr. Manfred wrote that while Mr. Luhnow (""one of the most successful baseball executives of his generation"") had ushered in the ""second 'analytics' revolution in baseball"" and capably rebuilt the Astros, the team's culture became ""insular,"" ""one that valued and rewarded results over other considerations"" and lacked sufficient oversight.","General Manager Jeff Luhnow and Manager A.J.

Sports,"U.F.C. 249 Is Off After Requests From California, Disney and ESPN",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/sports/ufc-249-canceled.html,"U.F.C. 249, a mixed-martial arts showcase scheduled for April 18 on Native American tribal land in California, was canceled on Thursday in response to apprehension about holding the event during the coronavirus pandemic. California state officials intervened by directly expressing their concerns about the event to Disney, the parent company of the U.F.C.'s broadcast partner, ESPN, according to three people with knowledge of the conversations. Dana White, the U.F.C. president, said in an interview on ESPN that he had received calls from ""the highest level"" of leadership at Disney and ESPN asking him not to hold the event, which would have featured 12 fights. ESPN holds the rights to televise U.F.C. fights and to sell its pay-per-view events, a lucrative relationship that yields the vast majority of the U.F.C.'s revenue. ""The powers that be there asked me to stand down and not do this event next Saturday,"" White said. That request came after Gov. Gavin Newsom of California called Disney officials, according to one of the people familiar with the conversations. The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to share the details of the calls.

Disney declined to comment, and Newsom's office did not respond to a request for comment. ""ESPN has been in constant contact with the U.F.C. regarding U.F.C. 249,"" ESPN said in a statement. ""Nobody wants to see sports return more than we do, but we didn't feel this was the right time for a variety of reasons. ESPN expressed its concerns to the U.F.C. and they understood."" An hour before White announced the cancellation, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California had called for the event to be postponed. In a statement, she said that ""at best this event ties up medical resources and sends a message that shelter-in-place orders can be flouted"" and that ""at worst, participants and support staff could carry the virus back to their home communities and increase its spread."" The card was originally scheduled for Barclays Center in Brooklyn, but was moved after Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York restricted mass gatherings and the New York State Athletic Commission announced it wouldn't authorize the event, The fights were then to be held at the Tachi Palace Casino Resort, on tribal land in Central California about 40 miles south of Fresno. In staging the event on tribal land, the U.F.C. was attempting to get around stay-at-home orders that have been issued in nearly every state, including California, as well as federal social distancing guidelines. California state regulators refused to authorize the event, and most state athletic commissions aren't approving fights during the pandemic. As a result, the U.F.C. would have had to provide its own referees, judges, medical staff and other services to make the bouts happen.

The Tachi-Yokut Tribe, part of the federally recognized Santa Rosa Indian Community, owns the Tachi Palace Casino Resort. They have sovereignty over their land and can set whatever rules they want, though the casino was closed the night of March 20 because of the pandemic. But because of a nearly 70-year-old federal law, Public Law 280, California state and local officials have broad authority to intervene in criminal and civil matters on tribal land. By expressing their concerns to Disney, California state officials avoided a potentially complicated and uncomfortable situation with the Tachi-Yokut. The U.F.C. had previously canceled three events that were scheduled for March and April, and White said on Thursday that his efforts to keep U.F.C. 249 intact had been ""a battle since Day 1."" He has insisted that he was being cautious and could safely hold the fights even amid a pandemic and despite a number of medical, legal and regulatory challenges. As recently as Wednesday night, the event's key stakeholders were adamant that it would go ahead, noting that the U.F.C. was able to host fights in an empty arena in Brazil last month. ""Precedent has been set, and Dana knows that he can pull this off in a very safe and controlled way that will keep his fighters and the crew safe,"" Mark Shapiro, the president of Endeavor, said in a telephone interview Wednesday night. Endeavor led the group that purchased the U.F.C. in 2016. Disney is based in Burbank, Calif., and has extensive financial interests in the state, through its theme parks, movie and television studios, and its Pixar and Lucasfilm subsidiaries. ESPN does not control U.F.C.'s fight schedule, but it has substantial influence over the company given the strong financial ties between the two organizations. ""These are people that I am partners with, people whom I have a lot of respect with, and I'm going to do it, I'm going to say yes,"" White said about the requests from Disney and ESPN to postpone the fight.

In 2018, ESPN agreed to pay the U.F.C. $1.5 billion over five years to show 30 events annually on the network's cable channels and on its ESPN+ streaming service. ESPN executives have credited the U.F.C. with being a major driver of ESPN+ subscriptions, and the agreement was deemed such a success that just one year later it was extended by two years and ESPN also bought the exclusive rights to sell and stream U.F.C.'s pay-per-view events. The value of the latter deal was not announced, but the U.F.C.'s pay-per-view events typically earn hundreds of millions of dollars annually. ESPN was going to charge $64.99 to watch U.F.C. 249. Shapiro said that business considerations were not behind the U.F.C.'s unwavering desire to hold U.F.C. 249 despite a worldwide pandemic, and that ESPN had not pressured them to go forward. The U.F.C. produces all of its own events, sending video feeds to ESPN to televise, and ESPN would not have had any production staff on the ground in California. ""The U.F.C.'s contractual relationship with ESPN has absolutely nothing to do with this decision,"" Shapiro said on Wednesday. ""ESPN has been clear about that."" The headline fight for U.F.C. 249 was originally a lightweight title bout between Khabib Nurmagomedov and Tony Ferguson, one of the U.F.C.'s most anticipated matchups in years. But Nurmagomedov traveled from San Jose, Calif., where he was training, to his home in the Dagestan region of Russia as White was still trying to find a backup location for the fight. Then Nurmagomedov withdrew when it became clear he would have problems traveling back to the United States to compete. Earlier on Thursday, Brian Butler, the manager of the strawweight fighter Rose Namajunas, said she had withdrawn from her bout in U.F.C. 249 because two of her family members had died. Their deaths, Butler said, ""were related to the coronavirus.""","Dana White, the U.F.C. president, has been aiming to stage fights during the coronavirus pandemic, but he said the card would not be held on April 18, as originally planned.",2afe7bed-e0eb-5ac9-9570-42b03d571bd2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/10/sports/09ufc-web-print/09ufc-web-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d8829d7bc45e93db995641dbd8ff1a81490e2150bca51831eb794a4979f59ec7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dana White, the president of the Ultimate Fighting Championship, had planned to hold a 12-fight card on April 18 on tribal land in California.",2afe7bed-e0eb-5ac9-9570-42b03d571bd2,N24News/imgs/2afe7bed-e0eb-5ac9-9570-42b03d571bd2.jpg,9
Television,"Apple, After Outcry, Makes 'Peanuts' Holiday Specials Available on PBS",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/arts/television/charlie-brown-apple-pbs.html,"It was all too fitting that an anti-commercialism Christmas classic, broadcast over the public airwaves every year since 1965, would be sidelined in 2020 to a paid streaming service operated by a tech giant.

Such was the widespread reaction in October when Apple TV Plus obtained the exclusive rights to the ""Peanuts"" catalog, including the widely beloved ""A Charlie Brown Christmas,"" not to mention ""A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving"" and ""It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown."" It meant families could no longer watch the holiday specials on ABC -- they would have to be streamed on the service Apple has been pushing since its debut last November.

To many, including the more than 260,000 people who signed a petition, it was a theft of holiday traditions befitting of grinches and blockheads, even though Apple would make the specials available for free for a few days under its agreement with the companies that own ""Peanuts.""

On Wednesday, Apple eased its grip on the shows, announcing a deal that would allow PBS to show ad-free versions of the Thanksgiving special on Sunday and the Christmas special on Dec. 13. The announcement did not say whether the specials would return to public television after 2020.","The tech giant, which recently gained exclusive rights to the widely beloved ""Peanuts"" specials, said they would air on public airwaves again this year.",147df0f3-72f1-5e53-a937-225b2dac353c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/20/multimedia/20charliebrown-txgiving-print/19charliebrown-txgiving-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3238165db7fe6e6b90b10102612e6d4da8dcfacf2ae6bd83291f2070278cc1cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving,&rdquo; one of the &ldquo;Peanuts&rdquo; holiday specials that has aired on American television for decades.

Music,Running the Paris Opera Was Never Going to Be Easy. But Come On.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/arts/music/paris-opera-alexander-neef.html,"Alexander Neef, the new director of the Paris Opera, on the roof of one of the company's two theaters this fall.





Running the Paris Opera Was Never Going to Be Easy. But Come On.

PARIS -- Wearing a dark blue suit, masked, and with a part in his hair so straight you could use it as a ruler, Alexander Neef, the new director of the Paris Opera, was holding a meeting in his airy office. It was Oct. 5, the day the company's eminent ballet was to give its first performance since strikes had closed the Opera's two theaters last December. But Paris had just been declared a high-risk coronavirus zone -- the latest sign that normalcy still lay far in the future. Mr. Neef was just five weeks into the job leading the Opera, among the most prestigious positions on the global cultural scene, overseeing an annual operating budget of 220 million euros ($261.3 million). There should have been no better time to start than this, the company's 350th anniversary, which was to have culminated this fall with a splashy new production of Wagner's epic ""Ring"" cycle. Instead, Mr. Neef had walked straight into an annus horribilis. Strikes from December to March shut down 84 performances, opening up a budget deficit of EUR45 million. Then the coronavirus began to spread, leading to lockdowns and months more canceled performances. An open letter has circulated about institutional racism at the company. There have been complaints in the press about the generous package -- around EUR81 million -- of state aid to the Opera, awarded before the results of an audit into its finances.

""I knew on Aug. 5 that I would start on Sept. 1,"" he said coolly over lunch. And all this before the second coronavirus lockdown, which President Emmanuel Macron of France announced in mid-October and which put an end to dreams of live opera and ballet at least through November. ""When we saw the numbers of new cases, you can unfortunately see these things coming,"" Mr. Neef said after the presidential announcement. ""We were in rather a good spot, and the new lockdown drove a wedge into all our plans."" The situation is undoubtedly grim. But Mr. Neef is at least helped by the fact that he isn't new to the Opera: From 2004 to 2008, he worked here as casting director under his mentor, the renowned impresario Gerard Mortier. His insider's knowledge of the institution was important, Mr. Neef said, in giving him confidence that he could cope with ""one of the most complex jobs in this field."" ""I thought, would I like to go back and work with these people?"" he said. ""The answer was yes."" Mr. Neef's existing relationships at the labyrinthine, notoriously political company may well be crucial in moving on from what ended as a frosty stalemate between the Opera (or at least its powerful labor unions) and Mr. Lissner.

Mr. Neef was born in the small town of Rosswalden, Germany, near Stuttgart, and grew up in a family that was not particularly interested in high culture. He discovered classical music through the radio and school music classes, and began to study the piano at 9. Although he was passionate about music, taping opera broadcasts and attending as many performances as he could, he studied Latin and modern history in college. ""I never considered music or opera as a professional opportunity,"" he said. ""It was too far from my background."" But he became friendly with a group of musicians who knew Mr. Mortier, then the director of the Salzburg Festival in Austria. The friends began to work there as unpaid interns, and Mr. Neef became Mr. Mortier's assistant.

""He was extremely polite and organized,"" the baritone Thomas Hampson said of Mr. Neef. ""I remember people saying, 'Everyone should have a right-hand man like Alexander Neef.'"" When Mr. Mortier left Salzburg in 2001 and became the director of the Ruhrtriennale festival in Germany, Mr. Neef followed him there -- then to the Paris Opera and, for a brief period, New York City Opera. ""All of a sudden, opera and theater had become a career,"" Mr. Neef said. Mr. Hampson said that there were very few administrators with Mr. Neef's encyclopedic knowledge of the repertory and singers. ""In his generation, he may be singular,"" Mr. Hampson said. ""And he is a lot of fun at dinner."" When the Canadian Opera Company approached Mr. Neef, then still casting director in Paris, in 2008, it was, he said, the first time he had thought about running an opera house. ""I thought there was no harm in engaging in that conversation,"" he said, ""and pretty much the same thing happened in Paris. You get asked, you think about it, you talk about it. If you want it too much, it's perhaps doomed."" Mr. Neef has been admired for making Toronto into an international opera destination, cultivating top singers and more ambitious productions. ""He was very confident in his desires and his concepts, and you felt it was coming from a real knowledge of opera,"" said Rufus Wainwright, whose opera ""Hadrian"" premiered in Toronto in 2018. ""Any disagreements with him are very upfront and clear. He is very dispassionate when he is angry, and very passionate when he is excited. He can put his foot down when running the institution, but when encouraging a composer, he can travel in the clouds with you a bit.""

When the disputes were between the work's creators, Mr. Wainwright added, Mr. Neef ""would stay off for a bit, then swoop in and fix everything, like a superhero."" Despite his reputation and credentials, Mr. Neef wasn't widely considered a favorite for the Paris position. But after a 45-minute interview with Mr. Macron, he was offered the job. ""Alexander fits with the profile of what Macron wants in France,"" said Matthew Epstein, a veteran artist manager and opera house administrator. ""He is artistically worldly, completely au courant with the North American side of the business, and has been in Europe regularly. And he is young: He could do the job for another 20 years if he wanted to."" Mr. Epstein added that while the Paris Opera can be ""a poisoned chalice"" for newcomers, Mr. Neef's prior experience there should serve him well. ""He has huge problems of finance because of the pandemic, huge labor difficulties to overcome, but I suspect he will be good at that,"" he said. ""He is very fair, and he doesn't shirk a difficult conversation.""

But Mr. Neef said that he had taken their appointment ""in a matter-of-fact way."" It was useful, he added, to have others reflecting on the issues that ""have been stressed by the pandemic, if not caused by it."" An open letter circulated by five Opera dancers and signed by 400 company employees has called for ""an end to the silence around racism."" Mr. Neef said that he has commissioned an external investigation of these issues, with a report due in mid-December. ""What this will help with is to create a system of accountability and set certain goals,"" he said. Manuel Brug, a critic at the German newspaper Die Welt, said the biggest concern about Mr. Neef was that he was still quite young and was not an insider in French cultural circles, as Mr. Lissner was. ""When you are running the Paris Opera, you have to be close to the politicians and the people with the money,"" Mr. Brug said, adding that another concern was the ballet company, which is led by the former star dancer Aurelie Dupont. ""Where are the big choreographers?"" Mr. Brug said. ""Paris needs that."" Mr. Neef said that he has been discussing projects with Ms. Dupont and is interested in commissioning contemporary scores ""that might strengthen the relationship between the musicians and the dancers."" Ballet, he added, ""can be both much more traditional and more modern than opera. And when you slot that in with what the opera does, you can have an incredible arc between traditional and avant-garde."" But neither he nor Ms. Dupont named any potential choreographic talent, though she added that the two were interested in expanding the ballet's international touring. Mr. Neef was equally circumspect about the programming for his first full season, 2021-22, saying only that it was important to perform both French and international works, and that he was interested in exploring what had been missing from the Opera's modern repertory.

As Mr. Neef went from one meeting to another throughout the day in early October, he listened more than he spoke, sometimes only intervening with a question or a brief, reassuring comment. ""I think sometimes people underestimate him because he is quiet and to the point and not flamboyant,"" Ms. Billinghurst said. ""But he has backbone and solidity and a very firm belief in his taste and decisions."" Between meetings, Mr. Neef popped in briefly to the first orchestral rehearsal for the ""Ring,"" thanking the hundred-plus assembled musicians for agreeing to be regularly tested for the virus, and for working in such a challenging environment. A mammoth project for any opera house, the ""Ring"" was intended to both celebrate the Opera's 350th birthday and as a suitably grand farewell to Philippe Jordan, its departing music director. By then, the project had already been downsized to a concert version for limited audiences; given the new lockdown in France, it will now be performed at the Bastille, the company's larger theater, without an audience, and each of its four parts broadcast by radio.

""Everything is day-to-day now,"" Mr. Neef said by phone in early November. ""We are rehearsing 'La Traviata' and 'La Bayadere,' and holding our breath about whether we will be able to perform for an audience in December."" But while it hasn't been the introduction he planned -- ""I have lost the year of quiet contemplation that I would have had,"" Mr. Neef said -- he has buckled down: ""I am ready to put in a lot of work and do a lot of unpleasant things if I can walk into the theater, see a performance and feel we somehow got it right.""","Alexander Neef has taken on one of the most prestigious jobs in culture amid a pandemic, labor strikes and internal unrest.",d4422998-b8d1-5a28-8b43-9dd138b92ace,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/22/arts/22NEEF-1/22NEEF-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0fb7d6ee1f3819f4613838846a94ae7a900e38424bb014960e952798792ee1c7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alexander Neef, the new director of the Paris Opera, on the roof of one of the company&rsquo;s two theaters this fall.",d4422998-b8d1-5a28-8b43-9dd138b92ace,N24News/imgs/d4422998-b8d1-5a28-8b43-9dd138b92ace.jpg,12
Fashion & Style,The Actress and Quarterback Still Work at Winning,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/fashion/weddings/the-actress-and-quarterback-still-work-at-winning.html,"Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It's No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way. Occupations She is an actress, he retired from the National Football League. He is now a co-host of a radio show in Los Angeles called ""Lunch Time with Roggin and Rodney"" on AM 570 LA Sports. Together, they are in the reality show ""Meet the Peetes"" on the Hallmark Channel. The couple married June 10, 1995 before 300 guests at the home of Leslie Moonves, the chairman and chief executive of CBS. It was June 1993, and unbeknown to Holly Robinson, her friend, the actor Lela Rochon, was setting her up with Rodney Peete, who, at the time, was a quarterback for the Detroit Lions. ""We went to a nightclub in L.A. He was super cute and he was nice, but I wasn't impressed with the whole athlete thing, or the groupies or distance,"" said Mrs. Robinson Peete, who is also an author and philanthropist. Disappointed she couldn't find love and the direction life was taking her, she went on an ""Eat, Pray, Love""-like trip to Bali. When she returned, Ms. Rochon invited her to Mr. Peete's for a party. ""It turned out he lived five minutes away from my house. There were 8 guys and 30 girls,"" she said. ""This wasn't my kind of party, so I found the food, and then left."" Fifteen minutes later there was a knock at her door. ""Rodney was standing there. He said, 'The party was over when you left.' That line was good enough to buy me a real date,"" she said. ""He took me to a wine-tasting party. I'd never been to one before and I thought maybe he's not the typical jock."" He wasn't. She learned that quickly. A year later he proposed to her on the set of ""Hangin' With Mr. Cooper,"" the show Mrs. Robinson Peete was starring in at the time. They married in 1995.

Rodney was monogamously challenged so I asked him to go to couple's therapy before getting married. He was opened to everything and that's why I liked him. That gave me enthusiasm. It's the work that he's willing to put in that got us here. We survived our son's autism, we survived the N.F.L., the distance of being away, and the depression of athlete retirement. When autism hit I thought that would break us, but it didn't. When we argue in front of kids, it makes us feel bad. It makes them feel bad, so we've learned to get on the same page. That's when we are the happiest. We try to turn down the volume of the radio. That's supposed to take us to a place of calm and introspection. We try. It doesn't always work. You have to put everything on the shelf and come down from it. That's how we can get back to the same page.

I'm controlling, impatient and blunt. As a special needs mom you don't take no for an answer, and that can make you a ball-buster. Rodney lets me know I have to soften my edges, listen, be patient and not be judgmental. I hear that from my kids, too. I need to slow down and relinquish control. I'm a millennial mom; he's an old school dad. He cares so much about our family. He wants to over-dad and I need to let him do that, and that's hard for me. I've learned it's not just my way or the highway, I need to share the road. He still has the desire to be romantic and make me happy. And that's really nice. We have not evolved parentally, we're still working on that. But he's evolved with me on what matters. And that's what's really important. Mr. Peete You need the right partner to reach and achieve the goals you have. You need to be on the same path going forward. Meeting Holly and getting to know her allowed me to get more in touch with my own feelings. I learned what a relationship was about. She was extremely strong, independent and confident. She had her own identity. She wanted a partner and companion. I hadn't had that before. Usually I was the one willing to walk away. Holly had her own life and she was willing to walk away if we weren't on the same page. That was an attractive trait. She could take it or leave it. That made me realize how much I loved her.

We learned together. I've learned no one's right. I've learned to be more sensitive, more emotional. I was a guarded guy. And very wary of relationships getting in the way. I didn't always let people in. I had to grow up. She did, too. Marriage is an agreement. There's a time when you're single and a time to know you have a significant other. From the beginning, we were very open about wanting a big family, that was very important to both of us. Marriage has reaffirmed that fact. And we respected each other and each other's careers, which let us thrive on our own separately. I've learned Holly is stronger than I thought. She's the rock in our family. She is family first and keeping the family strong and right. I have to fight for her to take time for herself. She doesn't always do that. We are so busy with kids to raise, and with work, you can lose sight of yourself and what brought you together. Three or four years ago I came up with the 20-second hug. No matter how mad you are, if one asks for the hug, it's mandatory. It's embracing and emotional. That runs through you while you're not saying anything. You slow down. You become less angry. It reminds you of why you're together.",Holly Robinson Peete and Rodney Peete have learned to share the road and the value of a 20-second hug.,d32f59a8-8d18-567f-8208-02c5f03a42d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/18/fashion/weddings/18NOSECRET/18NOSECRET-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0445dac1679eb96b21c6036b3fce8840636a09b1f4402e815055d33631137033&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rodney Peete and Holly Robinson Peete at their home. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s evolved with me on what matters,&rdquo; said Mrs. Robinson Peete. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s really important.&rdquo;",d32f59a8-8d18-567f-8208-02c5f03a42d7,N24News/imgs/d32f59a8-8d18-567f-8208-02c5f03a42d7.jpg,19
Real Estate,House Hunting in … Mauritius,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/realestate/house-hunting-in-mauritius.html,"This four-bedroom, four-and-a-half bath villa is in a golf-and-beach resort just outside the village of Grand Baie, on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius. The development is across the street from Mont Choisy Beach, which stretches for about a mile and a half along the island's northern coast. Completed in early 2018, the 5,468-square-foot concrete house ""is oriented west so you get beautiful sunsets in the living and pool areas,"" said Mridula Sembhoo, an agent with Pam Golding Properties, which has the listing. ""The pool has LED lights that make it look like you have stars in the water at night."" The villa's main entrance opens into a spacious foyer, with the open kitchen, dining and living areas to the right. Glass doors open across the back of the house to allow for a free flow between the interior and the pool area. The covered, furnished patio traces the back of the house, facing the pool and the backyard. At the far end of the pool is a covered barbecue area with additional space for dining and an outdoor shower. The villa's floors and patio are all Italian tile. Decorative wood and stone accents are used throughout the property.

The master bedroom, with sliding doors onto the patio and an en suite bath, is on the ground floor. Three additional bedrooms with vaulted ceilings and en suite baths are on the upper level, which has a terrace. The property, on a cul-de-sac among 14 similarly styled homes, sits on about a fifth of an acre and includes a two-car garage, store room and laundry facilities. Dense vegetation provides privacy from the adjacent 18-hole golf course, Ms. Sembhoo said. The purchase price includes a golf-club membership for one. The resort currently has 210 residential units, with another 52 having just begun construction, she said. The golf clubhouse has a pro shop and restaurant. A separate beach club, with a bar, restaurant and lounge areas, is nearing completion.

The tourist-friendly village of Grand Baie, about five minutes away, has beaches, restaurants, nightclubs, marinas, and a large shopping mall, Grand Baie La Croisette. Other island attractions include elaborate Hindu temples, botanical gardens, smaller offshore islands and national parklands. The capital city of Port Louis, with about 150,000 residents, is 30 minutes south by car, and Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam International Airport is about an hour away. The Republic of Mauritius, located about 1,200 miles off the southeast coast of the African mainland (with the much larger island nation of Madagascar between them), is a multiethnic, multilingual society of about 1.3 million people. Colonized first by the Dutch, then the French and finally the British over three centuries, the island finally declared independence in 1968.

Today, real estate, tourism and financial services are Mauritius's primary economic drivers, aided by a tax climate favorable to foreign investors. The island has a flat 15 percent tax on corporate and individual income, and no taxes on property, capital gains or inheritances. Foreigners may only buy property in what is called a ""property development scheme,"" which can be a resort-like development like this one, called Mont Choisy Le Parc Golf & Beach Estate, or a master-planned, mixed-use area known as a ""smart city."" The price range is vast, starting at $160,000 for a 1,000-square-foot apartment all the way up to $10 million for an 8,000-square-foot oceanfront villa, said Outi de Falbaire, director of the Mauritius office of Barnes International Realty. Mauritius does not have a central electronic deeds database, so tracking home sales and price data is difficult, said Richard Haller, the director of the Mauritius office of Pam Golding. But his agency does its own analyses of how values are faring in the main tourist hubs of Grand Baie and Tamarin, located on the island's western coast.

Sales have been slow of late, but the market was expected to pick up come October, when the peak tourism season begins, said Daniel Col, an agent with Mauritius Sotheby's International Realty. Ms. de Falbaire attributed the recent slowdown in part to uncertainty among European buyers about the prolonged political debates around Brexit. ""It seems that everybody in the whole of Europe is kind of waiting to see what is going to happen,"" she said. Mauritius's reputation as a tax haven, as well as rising inequality among its residents, have lately drawn media scrutiny, with one investigative report alleging that the government's use of tax treaties diverts tax revenue from poorer nations. Ms. de Falbaire said foreign buyers tend to fall into three categories: investors, retirees and people seeking a change in lifestyle. Most are from France and South Africa, with the rest a mix of Europeans and Africans.

Art & Design,'Impossible Objects' That Reveal a Hidden Power,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/09/arts/design/trevor-paglen-pittsburgh.html,"The American artist Trevor Paglen, whose work explores the power and ubiquity of surveillance technology.Credit...Aubrey Trinnaman for The New York Times

Tucked into a small gallery in the Carnegie Museum of Art in Pittsburgh is a plexiglass cube filled with computer parts. It's about 16 inches on each side, reminiscent of a Donald Judd box, updated for the digital era. It's also an open Wi-Fi hot spot to which you can link your phone. But before your phone connects to the internet, it routs traffic through the Tor Project's network, which anonymizes your phone, location and activity. Once you connect, you can move through the museum totally untraced. This sculpture, titled ""Autonomy Cube,"" is the kind of object for which Trevor Paglen, 45, has become known, as one of the foremost artists drawing attention to the power and ubiquity of surveillance technology. ""It's part of a series that I think about as impossible objects,"" he said of his latest work in a recent phone interview. He has also launched a satellite sculpture into space that he described as ""a giant mirror in the sky, with no commercial or scientific value, one with purely aesthetic value."" He has also sent a time capsule with 100 images from throughout human history into perpetual orbit, micro-etched onto a disc and encased in a gold-plated shell. These objects might be thought of as ""impossible"" because there is no incentive for their creation in a world where technological development has been commercialized, where surveillance is commonplace and where space remains largely militarized. Is making them, then, an act of optimism?

""Autonomy Cube"" is installed at the Carnegie Museum in an exhibition of Mr. Paglen's work titled ""Opposing Geometries."" Organized as part of the 2020 Hillman Photography Initiative, an incubator for innovative thinking about photography, the show will be on view until March 2021. Like almost all of Mr. Paglen's work, the exhibition takes contemporary technologies as its central subject, but many of the works here look backward too. The show, which features photographs, overarchingly demonstrates that even though ""surveillance"" and ""computer vision"" and ""machine learning"" have become today's buzzwords, they have a long history that is bound up with photography.

""The show is looking at historical forms of photography and the relationship between those forms of photography and different kinds of police power or state power,"" Mr. Paglen said. ""What is that relationship between photography and power?"" The multiplicity of meanings in Mr. Paglen's work are part of their appeal to technologists and thinkers. ""There's lots of rhetoric about how A.I. is going to change the world, and people don't realize how much technology has already changed the world and then when they do come to realize it, they often have the reaction of being scared or otherwise feeling powerless,"" said David Danks, a philosophy professor at Carnegie Mellon University whose work focuses on ethics and technology, and who is on the creative team of the Hillman Photography Initiative. ""I think a really important aspect of Trevor's work is that it doesn't just elicit a reaction, it doesn't just educate. I think Trevor's very good about indirectly giving people clues about how to be empowered."" Let Us Help You Protect Your Digital Life

Many of the works in this show are extensions of Mr. Paglen's longtime interest in the relationship between photography and artificial intelligence -- including his ImageNet Roulette, a digital art project and app that went viral last fall and allowed users to upload their faces to see how A.I. might label them. Often the results were racist, sexist and otherwise stereotypical -- a shock to users, which prompted ImageNet, a leading image database to remove half a million images.

Among these intertwined histories are that of photography and the settlement of the American West. While indelible images of places like Yosemite taken in the 1860s have long been ingrained in American mythmaking, Mr. Paglen is interested in them as early assertions of military control. The War Department (now known as Defense) funded several reconnaissance missions into the West in the 1860s and 1870s and sent photographers as part of a push to capture the new territory. Yet these sublime photos, Mr. Paglen said, were like ""the eyes of the state on a new territory,"" a theme he explores in his Carnegie Museum exhibition. Some of Mr. Paglen's photographs do look uncannily like Carleton Watkins's early photographs of Yosemite, and were in fact created using a historical printing process called albumen. But he also ran the photographs through computer vision algorithms, which struggle to identify objects in their natural environment, generating instead lines and shapes on the images' surface. The resulting photos are once hyper-modern and antiquarian, tying the past and present through technology. ""There are more pictures today made by machines for machines to interpret than all the pictures that have existed for humankind,"" said Dan Leers, the curator of ""Opposing Geometries."" ""But rather than throwing his hands up, Trevor is going back through the history of photography, and in some cases specifically reusing existing images, and in other cases, acknowledging historical processes in his making of these pictures.""

This is the first new exhibition that will open at the Carnegie Museum post-lockdown, and its themes have particular resonance after months when our lives moved mostly online. Mr. Paglen, whose main studio is in Berlin, and who normally travels frequently, spent the lockdown in Brooklyn, where he has a secondary studio. ""I'd never used Zoom before this,"" he said. ""So what is this layer of technology that has become so much a part of the ways in which we interact with each other? Especially when these forms of technology are also surveillance platforms, and are highly invasive tools."" During that time in New York, he made a series of new works that responded to the natural world in full-blown spring but also to the ways the pandemic was reshaping life and death. An exhibition of these works, titled ""Bloom,"" went on display at Pace Gallery in London on Sept. 10. In Pittsburgh, even the physical layout of the exhibition highlights the ubiquity and insidiousness of certain aspects of virtual life. The works are placed in three main spaces around the museum, and the intent is to mimic. ""For us that was really important because it gives an idea of infiltration,"" Mr. Leers, the curator, said. ""The surveillance that happens through algorithms and photography is quite hidden, and requires digging and sleuthing to find out how it's working."" Someone wandering through the museum might stumble serendipitously on Mr. Paglen's work, getting a glimpse of how the systems of surveillance are built seamlessly into the fabric of our everyday lives.",The artist Trevor Paglen peers into the history of photography and its relationship to state surveillance.,2b804367-a231-5522-a652-db7df15766e4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/13/arts/13PAGLEN-LOW-RES/13PAGLEN-LOW-RES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=536&w=1024&s=a2550562dedbd536f5148b889d5f6b119ab94b143f0bdcc65b6e703196539484&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The American artist Trevor Paglen, whose work explores the power and ubiquity of  surveillance technology.",2b804367-a231-5522-a652-db7df15766e4,N24News/imgs/2b804367-a231-5522-a652-db7df15766e4.jpg,14
Style,The Leonora Opens in Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/style/the-leonora-opens-in-chelsea.html,"A ""semiprivate"" clubhouse for the creative set is the latest attempt to pump new life into the Chelsea bottle-service scene. The Leonora is hoping to cultivate an atmosphere of exclusivity to lure celebrities from their urban aeries for a paparazzi-free night on the town.

To that end, Noel Ashman (of clubs like Veruka and Plumm) and Michael Bregman (son of the film producer Martin Bregman) have become partners with well-known investors, including the morning TV host Michael Strahan, the actor Luis Guzman, the performer Simon Rex and the party photographer Patrick McMullan. Membership cards granting admission were handed out to a few hundred of their friends, creating a cool, low-key insider vibe.

The Place The Leonora is on West 29th Street, near the new High Line extension, on what used to be a dull block of garages and tenements, but is now transforming into a luxury row. Though the club has an unmarked red door, it's hard to miss the hefty bouncer. Inside is a cozy, column-free space with exposed brick walls. Bottle-service banquettes line the room, each lit by a single candle, giving it the sense of a private party.

The Crowd A recent Saturday evening had artsy guys in their 30s accessorized with fedoras, beards and quirky glasses mixing with 20-something guys sporting backward baseball caps and baggy T-shirts.

Music,"At This New-Music Festival, You Can Count on Variety",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/arts/music/time-spans-festival.html,"It's often useful to prepare for a concert by checking out past recordings by a composer or ensemble. But it can also be fun to attend a show blind, with no informational baggage. On Tuesday, I took the unprepared route to a concert by the Bozzini Quartet, the first installment of this year's Time Spans festival, which runs through Saturday at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music in Manhattan. I came out of the show a proselytizing convert to the music of Linda Catlin Smith. Her string quartet ""Folkestone"" (1999) quickly revealed points of affinity with other music of the late 20th and early 21st centuries -- including the patient thematic unfolding of Morton Feldman, as well as the quiet dynamics familiar to composers of the Wandelweiser collective.

The work never rose above a generally hushed volume, but its contrasts rang with real force. (It stuck in the memory, too, and compelled me to purchase two of Ms. Smith's impressive recent albums -- ""Drifter"" and ""Wanderer"" -- from the imprint Another Timbre.) The Bozzini Quartet played this delicately intense music with subtle aggression, an approach that worked equally well for Cassandra Miller's ""About Bach,"" a work that hitches its references to Bach's great Chaconne to some high-pitched violin parts that sounded as though sung through clenched teeth. As with the memorable edition of the Time Spans Festival in 2017, this year's series, presented by the Earle Brown Music Foundation, followed no particular aesthetic. By taking in multiple concerts, you're guaranteed a good smattering of contemporary styles -- and, almost certainly, some works that seem comparatively thin. Wednesday's concert, by the often compelling ensemble Alarm Will Sound, was devoted to new compositions that seemed undercooked. I often love Alex Mincek's music, whether he's stirring a chamber ensemble into hyperkinetic activity or working with the extended ranges of instruments. But an excerpt from a planned evening-length work, ""Chimeras,"" belabored its use of an electronic element: a piped-in vocal part which ""spoke"" with an automated phone-operator's voice (before being chopped into less intelligible fragments). A stark seriousness of mood came through, but not enough of Mr. Mincek's florid instrumental imagination -- which meant that the Alarm Will Sound players were too often sidelined. ""The Intention"" was a collaboration between the composers Chris Stark and King Britt, who joined Alarm Will Sound on electronics. This piece also struggled to make the most of its ingredients, with the occasional interjection of Mr. Britt's samples -- or a stretch of hip-hop-influenced percussion -- coming and going without leaving much impact on the other players' parts. The most persuasive performance on Wednesday was of Zosha Di Castri's whirlwind ""Phonotopographie"" -- a piece that opened with fast riffs in the winds and eventually carried Alarm Will Sound out the doors of the hall, after a short parade through the aisles.

The Talea Ensemble played two similarly energetic pieces, by the composers Felipe Lara and Oscar Bettison, on Thursday. Mr. Lara's ""Fringes"" featured groups of players bordering the audience on three sides. The work throbbed throughout its duration, more than 20 minutes, by dealing out a steady stream of quick accelerations, motivic pileups and eerie pauses haunted by experimental effects. (In a post-performance question-and-answer session, Mr. Lara said he was trying to exploit zones where ""timbre becomes harmony,"" and harmony, in turn, becomes ""noise."") Mr. Bettison's three-movement ""Livre des Sauvages"" had a consciously madcap air reminiscent of John Adams's Chamber Symphony. But instead of Mr. Adams's concert-music vision of Schoenberg, mixed with tunes of what he has called ""good cartoons,"" Mr. Bettison sounded as though influenced by songs improvised by children on some sugar-strewn playground. The work was willfully wild in its asymmetric repetitions -- and at times seemed to delight in the possibility of becoming obnoxious -- but was also hard not to love for its headbanging inventiveness. (The arrangement's vitality brought out some astonishing playing from the ensemble, too.) The final Time Spans concert, on Saturday, brings the JACK Quartet together with live electronics, supervised by members of the SWR Experimentalstudio of Freiburg, Germany. Even though Mr. Lara has another piece on this program -- alongside works by Sabrina Schroeder and Georg Friedrich Haas -- the result will probably sound little like anything else from this week's concerts. After all, what makes this festival valuable is its reliable variety.","Our critic spent the week at the Time Spans festival, which provides a good smattering of contemporary styles — and some works that seem undercooked.",d77e5a77-c5ee-51ab-a48b-e20b993a60f8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/18/arts/music/18timespan/18timespans-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=395b55aee17abde2318ab94c1a9377115a417c72789561d485c51338439fe760&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Bozzini Quartet &mdash; from left, Clemens Merkel, Stephanie Bozzini, Alissa Cheung and Isabelle Bozzini &mdash; at the Time Spans festival.",d77e5a77-c5ee-51ab-a48b-e20b993a60f8,N24News/imgs/d77e5a77-c5ee-51ab-a48b-e20b993a60f8.jpg,12
Economy,Fed's Powell Says U.S. Must Get Virus Under Control Before Economy Restarts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/fed-powell-coronavirus-recession.html,"Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said during a rare television interview on Thursday that the United States ""may well"" be in a recession already, but that it should get the coronavirus under control before getting back to work. ""The first order of business will be to get the spread of the virus under control, and then to resume economic activity,"" Mr. Powell said on NBC's ""Today."" ""The virus is going to dictate the timetable here."" Mr. Powell's comments contrasted with those of President Trump, who has suggested that he wants many Americans to get back to work as soon as Easter, less than three weeks away, and that efforts to slow the spread of the virus by shutting down large parts of the economy should not be worse than the disease itself. The coronavirus pandemic is inflicting enormous economic damage in the United States, as quarantines close businesses, force workers to stay at home and create uncertainty that has spurred volatility in financial markets. Mr. Powell and his colleagues have been taking aggressive measures to shore up the economy, and he used his first major interview since the crisis began to underline what they are doing -- and why.

""You may well see significant rises in unemployment, significant declines in economic activity,"" Mr. Powell said. He added that eventually the economy would bounce back, helped by central bank policy, and ""we want to make that rebound as vigorous as possible."" Shortly after he spoke, new data on jobless claims were released, underlining just how painful efforts to contain coronavirus have been for America's businesses and employees. Nearly 3.3 million people filed initial jobless claims last week, a huge surge from 281,000 a week earlier and more than four times the previous record high. While the economic fallout from the coronavirus is sure to be severe, causing what many expect to be the biggest single-quarter drop in U.S. growth on record, Fed officials have said they are trying to put the economy into position so it can snap back once the pandemic ends and the world returns to work. To do so, central bankers want to ensure that American households are well placed to borrow and spend once the economy begins its recovery. They cut interest rates to near zero over the course of two emergency meetings this month to make credit cheaper. Officials are also trying to prevent the financial system from melting down amid extreme market volatility. The goal is to keep financing easily available to businesses, which could help tide them through the current dry spell. If too many companies fail and shed workers permanently, the downturn could become much more protracted.

The Fed committed to buying as many government bonds as necessary to soothe markets after ruptures appeared in Treasury and housing debt. It has intervened aggressively in the market for short-term loans between banks to keep that corner functioning smoothly, and it is using its emergency lending powers to backstop corporate bonds.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The aid legislation working its way through Congress would give the Fed money to ramp up those lending programs. The central bank had already announced facilities to help large corporations, small businesses and money market funds, backed by a Treasury Department fund containing $94 billion. Now, it can scale up those programs with Treasury agreeing to take initial losses on any loans that go sour. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has estimated that the financing, $454 billion, could support more than $4 trillion in Fed operations. ""When it comes to this lending, we're not going to run out of ammunition,"" Mr. Powell said. ""That doesn't happen."" His appearance at a fraught economic moment recalled a similar one by a predecessor, Ben S. Bernanke, during the depths of the 2007-09 recession. Mr. Bernanke appeared on ""60 Minutes"" in March 2009, six months after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy and seven before the unemployment rate would peak at 10 percent. Fed chairs never appeared in television interviews at the time, making it a momentous attempt to reassure the American people. ""I think we've averted that risk,"" Mr. Bernanke said when asked if the country was headed into a new Great Depression. ""Now the problem is to get the thing working properly again.""","The Federal Reserve chair voiced a reassuring, if uncertain, message in a rare televised interview as the coronavirus grinds America's economy to a halt.",9b596581-7d75-51d6-80e2-95c7dbef4cfe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/26/world/26dc-Powell01/26dc-Powell01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d133d77262850167b18f2ecdbf95f9a3307c9fdde8d9a65caac9b69359abb99e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jerome H.

Music,Russell Simmons Accused of Rape in New Lawsuit,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/arts/music/russell-simmons-accused-of-rape-in-new-lawsuit.html,"Russell Simmons has once again been accused of rape. A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.

In the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: ""She was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,"" the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.

The complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.

In a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he ""vehemently"" denied all of the allegations. ""They have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,"" the statement said.

Television,The Central Park Five: 'We Were Just Baby Boys',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/arts/television/when-they-see-us.html,"One morning earlier this month , a group of 10 men and teenage boys gathered for a photo shoot in a small studio on the Lower East Side. The overall mood was chill; as the music of Nipsey Hussle, 50 Cent and Wale filled the room, they chatted amiably in between shots, laughing, joking and moving along to the beats. The occasion for this gathering was bittersweet: Five of the subjects were Korey Wise, 46; Kevin Richardson, 44; Raymond Santana, 44; Antron McCray, 45; and Yusef Salaam, 45, known collectively as the Central Park Five. Their stories are being retold in ""When They See Us,"" a new Netflix mini-series created and directed by Ava DuVernay. In 1989 the men -- then teenagers -- were arrested in connection with the rape and assault of a white female jogger, and eventually convicted in a case that came to symbolize the stark injustices black and brown people experience within the legal system and in media coverage. The y were convicted based partly on police-coerced confessions, and each spent between six and 13-plus years in prison for charges including attempted murder, rape and assault.

The other five in the studio that day were the actors tasked with the challenge of portraying their younger selves in the series, premiering May 31: Jharrel Jerome, 21 ; Asante Blackk, 17; Marquis Rodriguez, 22; Caleel Harris, 15; and Ethan Herisse, 18. [A reporter reflects on the true story of the Central Park Five .] As they gathered for a group photo, Wise looked on and observed that they were in the stages of their lives when everything had stopped for him and the other men. ""Amazing. Just beautiful looking at them,"" he would say later when we sat down for an interview. He added, ""This is life after death. I always say that. From now on I know what Biggie was talking about. There's life after death."" In a series of chats, the Central Park Five and their onscreen counterparts discussed the pain, pride and emotional toll of revisiting those fateful events 30 years later. These are edited and condensed excerpts from those conversations.

Santana was 14 when he was arrested in 1989 and was incarcerated for close to seven years for the jogger case. In 2015, he tweeted the idea of a Central Park Five drama to DuVernay, who messaged him back with interest. SANTANA Ava was always my choice to do this series. I never met the woman, I didn't even know who she was, but I'd watched ""Selma"" -- there's a part where [Martin Luther King, Jr.] is confronted by [his wife] Coretta with recordings [of him with another woman], and I felt like that was bold to put in the film. By showing that, it showed the human side of this man who was put on a pedestal. And it told me that she had no fear of telling the truth. [Reliving these events] brings back the pain; it brings back the memories. But it's necessary. I was ready and I was willing to relive, to go through that pain again, to cry -- because it's necessary. It's a sacrifice. You want to change the culture, you've got to be engaged. This is how we got engaged. RODRIGUEZ That first day at the table read, I was immediately struck by how much of a light you are in a room, how engaged he is when he speaks to people, how bright and smiling and happy. That was one of the most important things for me. Knowing where the story goes, how can I capture, at least for a moment, the levity of his childhood, when it was allowed to be a childhood? One of my biggest fears as a person of color in this city, in this country is what happened to these men. There's nothing more terrifying than telling your truth and telling it over and over and over again, but having people refuse to honor it as the truth.

In that scene [when Raymond, Kevin, Yusef and Antron are in the holding cell], you're literally watching four boys have to work through really adult issues and they decide to tell the truth from there on out. But they shouldn't have to do that. That should not be their burden, to have to disentangle themselves from adult lies. It's often children of color's work. SANTANA [My father] still probably blames himself, but he doesn't speak about it. Our relationship is good, but it's a little different because, as a parent, when you have a child, you want to instill these values and morals on how to navigate through life. And he never got that chance to give me that; I grew up in the system. And then here I was, I come back and now I'm a man who doesn't want to take orders. And I think that might be the only issue that we still have. I don't call him and say, ""I got this problem, how do I solve it?"" RODRIGUEZ [As a cast] we were vulnerable with each other, we wept with each other and talked about the work with each other. We absolutely formed a brotherhood between us, and I think I'm so grateful for it. SANTANA I told Marquis just today: We watch them, the way they interact with each other -- we really sit there and go, ""That's us."" And Antron, when I said it, he started to tear up. He's like, ""Come on, Ray, man!"" You see the brotherhood. We were like, ""Wow, that's us, the childhood that we lost is being displayed right in front of us.""

WISE ""What if?"" That's a bitter taste. Because what if I hadn't met Reyes, I'd just be doing 15 [years], wondering. I'd still be working for my little pennies, for commissaries. Yusef -- that's my boy. That's my little childhood brother there. We were just baby boys, we were just trying to be entrepreneurs, having fun being kids. I had him out with me, riding him around, went to a barber shop, little haircut, little touch up. If [someone had told me], ""You, little [expletive], yo. You stay here, you don't go with him,"" I wouldn't have went. JEROME The hardest part of playing Korey was finding his happy moments and finding his moments where he's flirting with Lisa [played by Storm Reid], chilling with the homies or hanging out, smiling. It was hard to find those moments because you don't see that unless you actually meet the man and see him smile yourself. He's unique, and everything about him is unique. So it wasn't about being Korey Wise, it was about embracing him. JEROME They are the strongest men on this planet. Their chests are high, their shoulders are up, their heads are held up high, and no matter what pains I go through in life, I'm going to channel the spirit of Korey Wise. WISE This series is talking to my pain. I'm enjoying it; at the same time, it hurts. But I guess when it comes down to it -- people are going to enjoy it. They're going to enjoy this summer blockbuster. JEROME ""This summer blockbuster."" He just called himself a summer blockbuster.

Salaam was 15 years old at the time of his arrest, and spent more than six years in prison. He is now a motivational speaker. HERISSE I knew nothing [about these events before I was cast]. When I watched the [Ken Burns] documentary [""The Central Park Five""] I was shocked, because I had no idea that something like this could happen to anyone -- especially people who were my age at the time. I tried my hardest, from the audition on, to bring out that anger and disappointment in the justice system that I felt. I'm at a different place now, where seeing that this thing happened and is still happening, even now -- if I were going to be put anywhere near our system, I wouldn't feel completely safe. SALAAM We had all gone through hell. But when I saw this series, I immediately realized that we were in paradise compared to the hell that Korey was in. His was unrelenting. I went to jail and I was able to get a college degree. He never got an opportunity to breathe, to meditate, to just say, ""Phew, man, that was really crazy today. Let me kick my feet up a little bit and read this magazine."" That reality -- that pain, I think, is a better word -- is knowing that he came because of me. Offering an ""I'm sorry"" doesn't seem adequate. And I've been able to say that to him, but I also realized that that's not adequate enough to know what he went through, or that he could have been killed in prison. He almost was. It's not enough. And I have a direct role to play in that. HERISSE It was emotionally taxing at times [to embody that weight]. I feel like I speak for all of us when I say that we just wanted to get it right. We really want to tell their truth as best as possible for these men, for this story. This is the justice that they didn't get in '89.

McCray was 15 years old when he was arrested and served six years in prison. Though he maintained his innocence, his father, Bobby (played by Michael K. Williams), convinced him to tell the police what they wanted to hear, believing that they would let him go. HARRIS I did get ""the talk"" from my parents, and I was somewhat aware of how this country is run. But as a teenager, I'm still figuring out how this world is operated and just learning about this case and meeting these men -- it opened my eyes a lot as to what's really happening and how far we still have to go. McCRAY [Watching the series] was hard to get through. [Caleel] did a great job. Actually, he did too good. It took me right back, because my father was my best friend, my hero at the time. And it was real painful. I cried on my wife's shoulders. I don't know when was the last time I cried. I struggle with [my feelings toward my father]. Sometimes I love him. Most of the time, I hate him. I lost a lot, you know, for something I didn't do. He just flipped on me, and I just can't get past that. It's real hard. I did seven and a half years [including time spent detained during the trial] for something I didn't do, and I just can't get over it.

BLACKK It was a challenge trying to snap out of the emotions [on set]. It was really easy to feel the pressure of what was happening, but once ""cut"" was called -- in the courtroom scenes I found myself still angry and still really emotional. I couldn't even imagine myself going through what you went through, and it made me angry for you. This should have never happened. RICHARDSON It's a struggle that I deal with every day. But I didn't want to be an older, bitter man, even though I am angry, yes. But we did want to channel that energy and turn this to something positive so we could build for our future generation. BLACKK These five guys are human. They're not the ""wolf pack,"" the monsters they were portrayed as by the media in 1989. These are guys that have families, that have goals, aspirations, things they want to do with their lives, and they shouldn't just be brought down to a headline or something to be afraid of because they're not at all. If you see something and it confirms your biases, you might want to take a step back before you jump to a conclusion, because there's a huge chance it isn't true. RICHARDSON That's why I love the title ""When They See Us."" When they see us as black and brown people, we're judged already from the color of our skin. So like Asante said, take a step back and think. I want everybody to know that we're survivors of this and we don't want to see another Central Park Five. We don't want to see another Scottsboro Boys. We don't want to see another Emmett Till.","The men, whose story will be brought to life in Netflix's ""When They See Us,"" discuss the mini-series with their onscreen counterparts.",b6998a61-3932-5d6e-a245-65c9d123cfd5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/arts/02park-five1/02park-five1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ef776fd9f3c46f5ae7acb8a4a54da08b4c453220e72397f7679f491b52386d5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from top left, Antron McCray, Kevin Richardson, Raymond Santana, Yusef Salaam, Korey Wise, Marquis Rodriguez, Jharrel Jerome, Ethan Herisse, Asante Blackk and Caleel Harris.",b6998a61-3932-5d6e-a245-65c9d123cfd5,N24News/imgs/b6998a61-3932-5d6e-a245-65c9d123cfd5.jpg,3
Music,A New Opera Season: The Week in Classical Music,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/music/classical-music-youtube.html,"[Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Hi there! The Metropolitan Opera announced its 2019-20 season on Wednesday, and our writers have chosen some highlights. And Corinna da Fonseca-Wollheim took the measure of Daniel Harding and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam. In sadder news, the composer Dominick Argento, who spent much of his life in Minnesota, died at 91. A Facebook friend told me Argento was close with Mary Ann Feldman, the Minnesota Orchestra's longtime program annotator, who died this week, too. ""A sad week for the classical music community in the Twin Cities,"" my correspondent wrote. Argento's song cycle ""From the Diary of Virginia Woolf,"" written for Janet Baker, is one of his finest achievements. Enjoy it. ZACHARY WOOLFE

The director Mary Birnbaum, in her intriguingly updated production of Purcell's ""Dido and Aeneas"" at the Juilliard School, gives us an ambiguous ending. The staging posits that Dido doesn't die of heartbreak, but by self-immolation, after the public humiliation of being abandoned by her lover, Aeneas. (After all, what kind of queen falls hopelessly for an enemy?) But Ms. Birnbaum further complicates things: Her Dido storms off at the end and seems not to die at all. It's a difficult concept, but the cast, dressed in modish, stylized costumes, embraced it and brought lots of youthful, ardent singing to the music, backed by the sensitive period-instrument Juilliard415 ensemble, with Avi Stein conducting. (It runs through Sunday.) The mezzo-soprano Shaked Bar was a dark-toned, calculating Dido, a role she performed in 2017 in a semi-staged performance with the Jerusalem Baroque Orchestra. The baritone Dominik Belavy, in a sleek three-piece suit covered with embroidered flowers, was an impassioned Aeneas. I must mention Chance Jonas-O'Toole, a sweet-voiced tenor whose small role as a sailor was fortified with a couple of inserted, thematically appropriate Purcell songs. ANTHONY TOMMASINI

The Hebrew word ""mar'eh,"" which means ""face"" or ""sign,"" is the revealing title the composer Matthias Pintscher gave his 2011 work for violin and orchestra, which he led with the New York Philharmonic on Thursday. In this 23-minute score, the violin has long passages that seem to be suggesting the myriad auras, or faces, of sounds. It begins with the violin playing almost gauzy, hushed high tones and scratchy effects. In time, the sounds coalesce into wandering, elusive lyrical lines. Slowly, the violin becomes a questing, sometimes challenging protagonist in a dialogue with the orchestra. Violin utterances draw fidgety, softly rumbling and skittish reactions. Only passing episodes of assertive, gnarly music disrupt the mostly hushed, urgent conversation that dominates this sonic tone poem. Renaud Capucon was a spellbinding soloist, as in this excerpt from a 2015 performance with the Berlin Philharmonic, with the composer conducting. To open the program in New York, which runs through Saturday, Mr. Pintscher led a sumptuous, wildly animated yet cagey performance of Ravel's ""Alborada del gracioso."" He ended with a riveting account of Stravinsky's ""Firebird,"" a fresh, startling account that conveyed both the plaintive beauties and slashing rawness of this 1910 score. ANTHONY TOMMASINI On Thursday at the Miller Theater at Columbia University, members of Yarn/Wire and the International Contemporary Ensemble gathered for a Composer Portraits concert devoted to works by Wang Lu. The program began with the title work from her recent album, ""Urban Inventory."" That suite incorporates some prerecorded street scenes, captured by the composer while visiting Xi'an, the city in China where she was born.

The playing at Miller was sharp, particularly in the 2008 chamber work ""Siren Song,"" which includes passages of acidic squall, as well as pools of melodic reverie. Yet in other works, the players' acute emphasis on more striated textures occasionally seemed to lose sight of a fine balance between rupture and reflection that can be heard in this composer's music -- as in the final movement of ""Urban Inventory,"" during which traces of a recording by the pop singer Yang Yuying can be heard.

On Wednesday, a different sort of pop-classical meeting came during Andy Warhol's 1966 film ""Hedy,"" which screened as part of a triple feature at the Whitney Museum of American Art, currently showing a Warhol retrospective. Though the film progressed with the same long-take style of other Warhol moving-image works from the period, ""Hedy"" also employed interstitial music during its scene transitions. The wildly pulsing drone music that could be heard offstage as Warhol's camera zoomed in and out was immediately recognizable as the Velvet Underground.

The film has no traditional credits, but the Warhol Museum cites work by Underground members Lou Reed and John Cale as part of ""Hedy."" In his book ""Andy Warhol's Ridiculous Screenplays,"" Warhol collaborator Ronald Tavel remembers the entire group as being present at the Factory during the shoot -- though Warhol ""amazingly, unforgivably"" never managed to capture footage of their playing in the film. Mr. Tavel cites the composer La Monte Young as a likely influence on the group's playing in this performance, though the forceful music for the film also brought to mind some experiments conducted outside of Mr. Young's Theater of Eternal Music -- including Mr. Cale's 1965 guitar solo ""Summer Heat,"" as well as a later collaboration with Tony Conrad, ""Dream Interpretation.""

Opinion,Who's Profiting From the Coronavirus Crisis?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/opinion/coronavirus-hedge-funds.html,"The invisible killer is testing global capitalism as never before. Some highfliers are getting a long overdue comeuppance. Take, for instance, the Vision Fund, the $100 billion venture capital fund created by Masayoshi Son, a Japanese billionaire whose mantra is ""We only live once, so I want to think big."" On April 13, Mr. Son's conglomerate SoftBank announced it expects to lose $16.7 billion on its Vision Fund portfolio for the year ended March 31, after a string of bad bets on dubious Silicon Valley start-ups. The Vision Fund invested not just in WeWork, which was a debacle even before the coronavirus outbreak, but also Opendoor, a real-estate start-up; Zume, a restaurant robotics company; Compass, an online real-estate brokerage; and Oyo, an Indian budget hotel chain, all of which have fired or furloughed huge numbers of employees in recent weeks. SoftBank has already written off its $300 million investment in Wag, a dog-walking start-up, and is likely to lose its $2 billion equity investment in OneWeb, a British satellite operator, which filed for bankruptcy protection. The Vision Fund thrived for as long as it did in part because of a decade of super-low interest rates. Investors desperate for higher yields, like the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, flocked to the Vision Fund because Mr. Son promised them a 7 percent yield on most of what they invested, far higher than could be found investing in, say, Treasury securities. It was the same mentality that attracted other investors to the mountains of risky debt issued in recent years by companies with less-than-stellar credit ratings. (There were $9.6 trillion in U.S. corporate bonds outstanding at the end of 2019, nearly double the amount of a decade earlier.) This corporate debt bubble has finally burst -- another long-awaited reckoning. Companies with too much debt are in an existential struggle. On April 15, Neiman Marcus, the luxury retailer, skipped a $5.7 million interest payment on its outstanding bonds, setting the stage for its inevitable bankruptcy filing. Another large retailer, Macy's, has hired restructuring advisers. Ford has seen its debt downgraded to junk status, as has Kraft Heinz.

The United States will soon be awash in corporate bankruptcies, which means a world of hurt for creditors, shareholders and employees of overleveraged companies or companies that have found themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time. In fairness, no company could have anticipated the catastrophic effects of the pandemic. But the investors and employees of companies that for years gorged on cheap debt will pay the biggest price. There will be no soft landing for them. And yet, things are not playing out exactly as one would expect. That's in large part because of the Federal Reserve. It has intervened into the capital markets in a way that dwarfs what it did in 2008, an intervention that has been so big and so fast that it introduces another wild card into America's deeply uncertain economic future. It started on March 23, when the Fed put together an array of loans and other forms of credit, totaling around $4 trillion. It was a necessary move, intended to restore calm and liquidity to the financial markets, which had all but stopped providing much-needed capital to businesses and households. The Fed was acting, as it should, in its essential role as the lender of last resort, which happens when financial markets seize up and the usual sources of capital -- such as banks and global investors -- disappear. The Fed's actions allowed capital to begin to flow again, saving some companies and some jobs. On April 9, the Fed struck again, by providing an additional $2.3 trillion in loans to support the economy, bringing its intervention to more than $6 trillion. For the first time, the Fed said it would also consider buying the bonds of ""fallen angels,"" companies like Ford and Kraft Heinz that are considered so troubled that their debt is now rated by credit agencies as junk after decades of investment grade ratings.

It also said it would be willing to buy high-yield exchange-traded funds. The Fed had never before agreed to buy such risky securities, giving speculators hope it might be willing to buy anything, including equities. Last August, the Fed held around $3.7 trillion in credit assets on its balance sheet; it now holds more than $6 trillion. Thanks to the Fed, the debt markets sprung back to life. They had been shut for a month, but then in one week at the end of March, 49 companies issued $107 billion of investment-grade bonds, the single-largest week of issuance on record. Then came a parade of junk bonds: Yum Brands, the parent company of KFC and Pizza Hut, raised $600 million of new debt on March 30. On April 1, the cruise ship company Carnival issued $4 billion of new debt. The Fed's actions may have saved some jobs at struggling fast-food chains and cruise ship operators, but they are also warping the financial markets, just as they did in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis. By buying junk bonds, the Fed has created a proverbial ""moral hazard"" for those investors whose risk-taking had gotten out of control but now may not face the consequences for their profligacy. This problem is revealed most clearly in a spat that has pitted one group of billionaire investors against another. On one side are private-equity firms including Apollo Global Management and the Carlyle Group, which want some of the Paycheck Protection Program bounty for their struggling, overleveraged portfolio companies. This is an outrage, of course. Private-equity firms have more than $1.5 trillion of their own capital that they could use to salvage their losers instead of hoovering up money meant for the less fortunate. On the other side are people like Howard Marks. He is the co-founder of Oaktree Capital Management, one of the largest investors in distressed securities in the world. He made his billions betting that markets will act rationally in challenging times. In recent years, he has been warning that overleveraged companies will fail and that overpriced bonds will return to earth. In an April 14 letter to his investors, Mr. Marks expressed his ire about the Fed's moves that rescued such companies. ""Capitalism without bankruptcy is like Catholicism without hell,"" he wrote, recalling an old Wall Street truism. ""Markets work best when participants have a healthy fear of loss. It shouldn't be the role of the Fed or the government to eradicate it."" Mr. Marks is correct, in theory. Companies and investors that make poor economic decisions should be penalized for their mistakes. The system won't function properly if, every time there is a major crisis, the bad actors get rescued. The Fed could be inadvertently reinflating another asset bubble right now, although it is comforting that those lucky companies tapping the capital markets are paying investors much higher rates of interest than they have in years. Investors seem to have finally wised up to the meaning of risk.

The Fed's moves, at least for a while, may have saved the pension funds of firefighters, teachers and police officers -- which often buy the high-yield securities issued by risky companies -- from far worse losses. If in order to rescue those retirement funds and jobs at some troubled companies, we have to live with the Fed's moves, then that's a trade-off worth making. The Fed was created for moments such as this one, and it's a blessing that it has acted forcefully. In such times, there are always a few who somehow see trouble coming and find a way to profit from it. Take, for instance, Bill Ackman, the hedge fund manager. In mid-February, he started buying insurance on various bond indexes -- a bet that the debt bubble would burst -- based on his hunch that investors would abandon the riskier securities in those indexes as the pandemic spread from Asia to the West. His $27 million hedge was completed on March 3, and he sold his positions on March 23, the day the Fed announced its first major new intervention, for a profit of $2.6 billion. Mr. Ackman played the Fed's moral hazard, betting correctly that until the Fed and the Congress acted, the markets would tank. And that once they did, that the markets would start to recover. (He has since plowed his winnings back into stocks.) For speed and accuracy, Mr. Ackman's bet may be the single best trade of all time. For the rest of us, there is more painful uncertainty. Until Americans feel safe -- really safe -- there isn't going to be much good news from this economy. And there isn't a whole lot that Congress, or the Fed, can do about that. William D.

Economy,Loans Borrowed Against Pensions Squeeze Retirees,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/business/economy/pension-loans-drive-retirees-into-more-debt.html,"To retirees, the offers can sound like the answer to every money worry: convert tomorrow's pension checks into today's hard cash. But these offers, known as pension advances, are having devastating financial consequences for a growing number of older Americans, threatening their retirement savings and plunging them further into debt. The advances, federal and state authorities say, are not advances at all, but carefully disguised loans that require borrowers to sign over all or part of their monthly pension checks. They carry interest rates that are often many times higher than those on credit cards. In lean economic times, people with public pensions -- military veterans, teachers, firefighters, police officers and others -- are being courted particularly aggressively by pension-advance companies, which operate largely outside of state and federal banking regulations, but are now drawing scrutiny from Congress and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The pitches come mostly via the Web or ads in local circulars. ""Convert your pension into CASH,"" LumpSum Pension Advance, of Irvine, Calif., says on its Web site. ""Banks are hiding,"" says Pension Funding L.L.C., of Huntington Beach, Calif., on its Web site, signaling the paucity of credit. ""But you do have your pension benefits.""

Another ad on that Web site is directed at military veterans: ""You've put your life on the line for Americans to protect our way of life. You deserve to do something important for yourself."" A review by The New York Times of more than two dozen contracts for pension-based loans found that after factoring in various fees, the effective interest rates ranged from 27 percent to 106 percent -- information not disclosed in the ads or in the contracts themselves. Furthermore, to qualify for one of the loans, borrowers are sometimes required to take out a life insurance policy that names the lender as the sole beneficiary. LumpSum Pension Advance and Pension Funding did not return calls and e-mails for comment. While it is difficult to say precisely how many financially struggling people have taken out pension loans, legal aid offices in Arizona, California, Florida and New York say they have recently encountered a surge in complaints from retirees who have run into trouble with the loans. Ronald E. Govan, a Marine Corps veteran in Snellville, Ga., paid an interest rate of more than 36 percent on a pension-based loan. He said he was enraged that veterans were being targeted by the firm, Pensions, Annuities & Settlements, which did not return calls for comment. ""I served for this country,"" said Mr. Govan, a Vietnam veteran, ""and this is what I get in return."" The allure of borrowing against pensions underscores an abrupt reversal in the financial fortunes of many retirees in recent years, as well as the efforts by a number of financial firms, including payday lenders and debt collectors, to market directly to them.

The pension-advance firms geared up before the financial crisis to woo a vast and wealthy generation of Americans heading for retirement. Before the housing bust and recession forced many people to defer retirement and to run up debt, lenders marketed the pension-based loan largely to military members as a risk-free option for older Americans looking to take a dream vacation or even buy a yacht. ""Splurge,"" one advertisement in 2004 suggested. Now, pension-advance firms are repositioning themselves to appeal to people in and out of the military who need cash to cover basic living expenses, according to interviews with borrowers, lawyers, regulators and advocates for the elderly. ""The cost of these pension transactions can be astronomically high,"" said Stuart Rossman, a lawyer with the National Consumer Law Center, an advocacy group that works on issues of economic justice for low-income people. ""But there is profit to be made on older Americans' financial pain."" The oldest members of the baby boom generation became eligible for Social Security during the recent housing bust and recession, and many nearing retirement age watched their investments plummet in value. Some are now sliding deep into debt to make ends meet. The pitches for pension loans emphasize how difficult it can be for retirees with scant savings and checkered credit histories to borrow money, especially because banks typically do not count pension income when considering loan applications. ""The result often leaves retired pensioners viewed like other unqualified borrowers,"" one of the lenders, DFR Pension Funding, says on its Web site. That, the firm says, ""can make the 'golden years' not so golden."" The combined debt of Americans from the ages of 65 to 74 is rising faster than that of any other age group, according to data from the Federal Reserve. For households led by people 65 and older, median debt levels have surged more than 50 percent, rising from $12,000 in 2000 to $26,000 in 2011, according to the latest data available from the Census Bureau.

Borrowing against pensions can help some retirees, elder-care lawyers say. But, like payday loans, which are commonly aimed at lower-income borrowers, pension loans can turn ruinous for people who are already financially vulnerable, because of the loans' high costs. Some of the concern on abuse focuses on service members. Last year, more than 2.1 million military retirees received pensions, along with roughly 2.6 million federal employees, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Lawyers for service members argue that pension lending flouts federal laws that restrict how military pensions can be used. Mr. Govan, the retired Marine, considered himself a credit ""outcast"" after his credit score was battered by a foreclosure in 2008 and a personal bankruptcy in 2010. Unable to get a bank loan or credit card to supplement his pension income, Mr. Govan, now 59, applied for a payday loan online to pay for repairs to his truck. Days later, he received a solicitation by e-mail from Pensions, Annuities & Settlements, based in Wilmington, Del. Mr. Govan said the offer of quick, seemingly easy cash sounded too good to refuse. He said he agreed to sign over $353 a month of his $1,033 monthly disability pension for five years in exchange for $10,000 in cash up front. Those terms, including fees and finance charges, work out to an effective annual interest rate of more than 36 percent. After Mr. Govan belatedly did the math, he was shocked.

""It's just wrong,"" said Mr. Govan, who filed a federal lawsuit in February that raises questions about the costs of the loan. Pitches to military members must sidestep a federal law that prevents veterans from automatically turning over pension payments to third parties. Pension-advance firms encourage veterans to establish separate bank accounts controlled by the firms where pension payments are deposited first and then sent to the lenders. Lawyers for retirees have challenged the pension-advance firms in courts across the United States, claiming that they illegally seize military members' pensions and violate state limits on interest rates. To circumvent state usury laws that cap loan rates, some pension advance firms insist their products are advances, not loans, according to the firms' Web sites and federal and state lawsuits. On its Web site, Pension Funding asks, ""Is this a loan against my pension?"" The answer, it says, is no. ""It is an advance, not a loan,"" the site says. The advance firms have evolved from a range of different lenders; some made loans against class-action settlements, while others were subprime lenders that made installment and other short-term loans. The bankrupt firm in California, Structured Investments, has been dogged by legal challenges virtually from the start. The firm was founded in 1996 by Ronald P. Steinberg and Steven P. Covey, an Army veteran who had been convicted of felony bank fraud in 1994, according to court records. To attract investors, the firm promised an 8 percent return and ""an opportunity to own a cash stream of payments generated from U.S. military service persons,"" according to the California Department of Corporations. Mr. Covey, according to company registration records, is also associated with Pension Funding L.L.C. Neither Mr. Covey nor Mr. Steinberg returned calls for comment. In 2011, a California judge ordered Structured Investments to pay $2.9 million to 61 veterans who had filed a class action. But the veterans, among them Daryl Henry, retired Navy disbursing clerk, first class, in Laurel, Md., who received a $42,131 pension loan at a rate of 26.8 percent, have not received any relief.","Pension advances, federal and state authorities say, are carefully disguised loans that carry interest rates that are often many times higher than those on credit cards.",319a533a-dbd9-50ec-bf5b-e324b0967c59,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/28/us/SUB-PENSION/SUB-PENSION-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=414&w=600&s=8522120c56a34c7bccd5cd938cea33364281630c473275c5842880ab5065f67b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Ronald E.

Travel,What You Need to Know About Traveling to Australia During This Fire Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/travel/australia-fires-travel-questions.html,"What You Need to Know About Traveling to Australia During This Fire Season

As one of the worst fire seasons in Australia's history continues to engulf parts of the country, authorities asked thousands of residents and tourists to evacuate affected areas, and the government announced the large-scale use of military assets to try and tame the fires, leaving some people stranded and those with upcoming trips to the country unsure of whether to visit or not. Currently, fires are largely burning across the states of Victoria, where Melbourne is; New South Wales, where Sydney is; and South Australia, where Adelaide is. Military ships and aircraft have been deployed to deliver water, food and fuel to towns cut off by the fires, as well as to rescue those who are stranded. The Australian writer Richard Flanagan wrote last week that the amount of land the fires have burned is almost ""as large as West Virginia, more than triple the area destroyed by the 2018 fires in California and six times the size of the 2019 fires in Amazonia."" Here is what we know about the fires and how they could affect upcoming trips to parts of Australia.

Where exactly are the fires and how bad are they? Since September, the fires have burned millions of acres across the country. The state of New South Wales has been the most affected. There have also been blazing fires in the state of Victoria. So far, at least 23 people have died, more than 1,500 homes destroyed and millions of animals killed. Both Victoria and New South Wales declared a state of emergency this week; on Friday officials said that conditions will worsen this weekend and pleaded with people to evacuate. ""If you are holidaying on the South Coast, particularly the general area from Batemans Bay to the Victorian border, you need to leave before this Saturday,"" the New South Wales Rural Fire Service said on Thursday. The South Australian Country Fire Service is advising anyone traveling to Kangaroo Island, which lies off the coast of South Australia, and where there have been extensive fires, to check with their accommodation or travel providers. The island is a popular destination for Australian and foreign tourists alike. The fires and the conditions that cause them, including heat and drought, aren't new to Australians, but this season's extreme highs are. High temperatures and strong winds, combined with the long drought and low moisture in the soil, have kept fires blazing. Australia had its hottest day on record, with average highs of 107.4 degrees Fahrenheit, or 41.9 degrees Celsius, in December. The extreme heat came after the driest spring on record.

In November, the state issued a ""catastrophic"" fire danger rating for the first time in the decade that the current warning system has been in place. Former New South Wales Fire and Rescue chief Greg Mullins said that beginning in April he and 22 other former fire and rescue workers tried to warn Prime Minister Scott Morrison that this fire season would be an especially difficult one and it would be wise to get more water bombers. The fire chiefs were not able to get a meeting with the prime minister, Mr. Mullins said. Last week, angry residents of the Bega Valley township of Cobargo confronted Mr. Morrison when he visited. Are major cities, including Sydney and Melbourne, safe from fires? Although the fires haven't ravaged Sydney or Melbourne, and have mostly been in rural areas, smoke and ash have reached coastal suburbs more than 50 miles away, causing the air quality to severely decline. The bush fires have created toxic pollution and choking smoke, causing the air quality index in Victoria to rise to more than 999 -- the worst in the world on Thursday. Any air quality index over 200 is considered hazardous to health. In Sydney heavy smoke has discolored the sky on many days, and the air quality there has at times been among the worst in the world. In Canberra, the nation's capital, the air quality rating was over 340, leading some businesses to remain closed on Monday. Beijing's rating was 170. The Australian Medical Association warned people who are sensitive to smoke, and those with pre-existing heart and lung conditions, to take extra care during the fires. In Melbourne, people rushed to buy P2 and N95 smoke masks. People traveling to Australia should consider bringing their own. What should I do if I'm planning to visit one of the affected areas in the next few weeks? U.S. Embassy officials said on Thursday that tourists on the South Coast of New South Wales should leave because of ""extreme fire danger.""

""Whilst bushfires continue to impact parts of Australia, many areas are unaffected and most tourism businesses are still open,"" said Phillipa Harrison, the managing director of Tourism Australia, the country's tourism agency. ""It is more important than ever that we rally around our communities and the tourism sector who may have been impacted."" It's worth remembering that Australia is a large country, with many parts that are unaffected by the current wildfires. Even in New South Wales and Victoria, for many people it's still business as usual, with the fires happening far away. People don't have to cancel trips entirely and those who are already there don't have to leave the country. There are currently no fires in the Northern Territory, where Uluru is, but there are some fires in Tasmania and in Western Australia, where Perth is, but all three areas are still considered largely safe.

If I want to cancel my trip, will airlines and cruise companies give me a refund? If you are traveling to an area affected by the fires, you will likely be able to get a refund or have the option of rescheduling. However, if you are hoping to cancel a trip to a part of the country where there are no fires or where evacuations haven't been announced, then it's best to call your airline and talk to a representative. Airlines including Qantas, Virgin Australia Air New Zealand and Hawaiian Airlines are keeping a close eye on the fires, they said, but for now flights are running as usual. ""We are monitoring the situation closely and will continue to address traveler concerns on a case-by-case basis,"" a media representative for Hawaii Airlines wrote in an email.","A devastating fire season is creating uncertainty among travelers. Experts recommend getting travel insurance, checking on airline and hotel cancellation policies, and knowing exactly what areas are affected.",068d0a84-828f-5941-a580-95cb5ba64266,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/19/travel/australia-travel2/merlin_166636377_4e8f2ae9-9ed9-464c-aec7-98279c5aaac0-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b269486e4e9eb3e4cd46bf068070784cc48fe34d9813615ed46be61f95197cf9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"South of Sydney, an air tanker drops fire retardant on a bush fire.",068d0a84-828f-5941-a580-95cb5ba64266,N24News/imgs/068d0a84-828f-5941-a580-95cb5ba64266.jpg,4
Economy,"At Last, Recovery Heads Where the Fed Wants It",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/16/business/april-consumer-price-rise-points-to-an-economic-upswing.html,"The Federal Reserve finally seems to be getting what it wants. Two indicators of economic health that the Fed and its chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen, have identified as keys to a stronger recovery -- modestly higher inflation and a more robust job market -- finally seem to be moving in the right direction, according to new data released by the government on Thursday. In particular, economists said, a rise in the Consumer Price Index in April, along with several other reports this week, suggest a broader economic firming is underway after a weak, weather-plagued start to 2014. Besides the increase in consumer prices reported on Thursday, data Wednesday on producer prices showed a rise of 0.6 percent last month, the largest increase since September 2012 and an indication that demand for a number of basic goods is growing faster than economists expected. At the same time, a survey of small-business optimism on Tuesday showed sentiment at its best level since before the recession began in December 2007.

These nascent signs of a rebound in the United States stand in stark contrast to the economic landscape in Europe, where many countries are struggling to grow at all, and stagnation, deflation and high unemployment remain menaces. Although preventing higher inflation has long been the traditional concern for central bankers, and many remember it as a serious problem from the 1970s, the Fed has been more worried in recent years about the risk of stagnant prices, which reflect an economy struggling to recover from the financial crisis and recession. As recently as last month, in a speech in New York, Ms. Yellen warned that the danger of too little inflation still outweighed the risks posed by too much. But even as the Fed's preferred inflation gauge remains contained, the new data from the Labor Department Thursday, including a 12-month rise in consumer prices of 2 percent, suggests inflation is moving within shouting distance of the Fed's target.

A separate Labor Department report on Thursday put new claims for unemployment insurance last week at their lowest level since May 2007, the latest in a series of indicators suggesting a healthier labor market, including the upswing in payrolls reported by employers last month. The American economy is still emerging from a very slow patch. The first estimate for the growth rate of the economy last quarter showed that output expanded at a rate of just 0.1 percent, and that number may even drop into negative territory when the Commerce Department revises the figure later this month. Other data this week on industrial production and housing has also been underwhelming, and even some relative optimists like Mr. Shepherdson foresee more headwinds for the housing market as rates rise. Still, many private experts, as well as the policy makers at the Fed, argue that a substantial part of the weakness last quarter was caused by frigid temperatures and wintry conditions that delayed business activity in many part of the country, rather than a fundamental slowdown. Private economists forecast overall growth in the United States could rise at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent in the second quarter, the period of April, May and June.

The advance on the price front was widespread. ""Virtually anywhere you look in this report, you see inflation is turning somewhat higher,"" said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. ""Prices for services have risen at a solid pace for some time, but what's changed as of late is that goods prices have started to firm up after actually dropping."" For example, he pointed to increases in prices for new and used vehicles, airline tickets and prescription drugs, as well as for apartment and house rentals. ""It's not where you'd say there was an inflation problem, but the Fed is starting to get their wish for a move up in the inflation rate,"" Mr. Maki added.

The less volatile core rate of the Consumer Price Index, which excludes food and energy prices, increased by 0.2 percent in April, compared with the 0.1 percent gain economists had expected. Energy and food prices also rose sharply, lifting the total increase for consumer prices to 0.3 percent. Meat prices rose by 2.9 percent, the biggest monthly jump in more than a decade. One reason that the Fed worries about persistently low inflation and the threat of deflation is that they discourage consumer spending and hold back investment. They are also difficult to overcome, as Japan's experience in recent years has shown. Mr. Maki noted that while the Fed still possessed tools to combat inflation, it had few options in reversing deflation, with short-term interest rates near zero. With inflation now showing signs of picking up, and a gradual improvement in the labor market bringing the unemployment rate down to 6.3 percent in April, the Fed is now on a glide path that could lead to the first increase in short-term rates, starting in the second half of 2015. ""If inflation continues to rise as we expect it to, and the unemployment rate keeps falling, it could potentially change the timing of the first rate hike and move it up slightly,"" Mr. Maki said.","Several notable indicators of economic health, including the Consumer Price Index, finally seem to be moving in the direction the Federal Reserve says is needed for a strong recovery.",33ee3001-34df-562d-8b5b-64dff95848d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/16/business/ECON/ECON-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=414&w=600&s=6e65fd415af25e5da3a7bf23febb7d9aa7ba7dac5d05b80505eec12af233ca24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Cresencio Lara at the Outdoor Grill in Culver City, Calif.

Television,Danai Gurira Was 'Amazed' by Sunday's 'The Walking Dead',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/arts/television/the-walking-dead-michonne.html,"This interview includes spoilers for Sunday night's episode of ""The Walking Dead."" We find ourselves in an empty new world. People have retreated to their homes, and out in the streets the sight of some lone person shuffling toward you is cause for alarm -- keeping your distance is crucial. Is this real life ... or is it just ""The Walking Dead""? The parallels are hard to overlook. With its ghost-town cities and post-apocalyptic mood, AMC's popular zombie thriller is littered with references to the ruinous disease that ended the Time Before (""Clean Hands Protect Lives"" reads a cautioning poster we see in Sunday's episode of the show) that now seem familiar. And while the lead actress Danai Gurira, who plays the katana queen Michonne, didn't want to trivialize the ongoing coronavirus crisis by connecting it to the dark fantasy of a TV show, she, too, is unsettled. ""There's nothing quite like facing a pandemic,"" Gurira said in a recent interview. ""I've never experienced anything like this moment in our time on earth, and we're still in the middle of it, you know? It's a real moment-by-moment situation, which does relate to our show's themes -- the struggles that people are having, the tragedies, and the ways that we move forward and get through this together, as a society."" The society we've been immersed in on ""The Walking Dead"" for the last decade is now losing one longtime member. In Sunday's Season 10 episode, ""What We Become,"" Michonne takes her leave of the show, almost exactly eight years after her first appearance in the closing moments of Season 2. She was the mysterious hooded figure who rescued an endangered Andrea (Laurie Holden) by slicing through the undead as two docile ""walker"" pets stood behind her in chains -- a startling entrance that signaled the arrival of a fierce warrior.

Over the years, Michonne has become more complex: We've seen her vulnerable side, her romantic side, even her maternal side as she became the devoted mother of an adopted daughter, Judith, and her biological son RJ. That human dimension deepens further on Sunday's show, in a sequence in which a tripping Michonne reimagines a series of events from her past, suggesting what her life might have been like if she'd joined Team Negan (led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), before discovering concrete evidence that her former lover, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) was still alive, and out there ... somewhere. Michonne's exit from ""The Walking Dead"" will leave her children in the care of Uncle Daryl (Norman Reedus), and could free the character to pursue and maybe eventually reunite with Grimes, whose story will be continuing in planned films. The character's departure frees Gurira, who's also an esteemed playwright, to devote more time to her literary career. She's also the showrunner of HBO Max's limited-series adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel ""Amerikanah."" ""It's bittersweet,"" Gurira said of leaving ""The Walking Dead"" after all these years. ""But it's time for me to go on other journeys."" During a phone interview, Gurira talked about Michonne's alternative reality, the need for female leadership to be dramatized, and what she won't miss about ""The Walking Dead."" Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What did you think about Michonne's final episode, where we get to see the life she might have led if she'd never helped Andrea? That was new! It has a ""Sliding Doors"" component, doesn't it? I never imagined stepping into this alternative reality for the character, going back to the beginning and remembering who she is and how that affects the choices she makes in the present day -- right up to her last choice at the end of the episode. It was fascinating, playing those moments of who she could have so easily become. She was very dislocated from her humanity when she met Andrea, and there was something about Andrea that made her decide to not do what she does in this alternate scenario. It was trippy -- in the literal and the storytelling sense.

I think what I've enjoyed most about this job is that every year there's stuff that you've never done before. Even back when Rick was gone, and then within the next episode, Michonne had a son. And that's why I'm finding it hard to leave, because I always knew that year after year, there was going to be something challenging that would stretch me. They walked me through this last episode long before I got the script. But I wasn't sure how it was going to work out until today, when I finally saw it. It was chilling to watch. And I don't even know how they did some of that. I mean, all of the stuff where you see Michonne making a different choice, that's new footage. But they blended old footage with new footage in an impressive way. I was quite amazed.

Well, all I'll say is, I've been part of ""The Walking Dead"" franchise and the Marvel movie franchise, and I've been taught to not talk about things. I'm not saying it is or it isn't happening. But I think it would be very cool to see this world open up in a way that you can do through a movie exploration. There are a lot of stories to tell that you can't get to when you're following a certain narrative in a TV show. But there are all these other narratives that are like, ""Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?"" It's extremely exciting. If she's not continuing in the franchise films, this episode closes her chapter. And she's inspired so many people. I think for all the women on our show, there's been a lot of power. You've seen a lot of female characters grow into their power and leadership and their ability to hold their own in whatever circumstances. I don't know how often you see that. I'm a feminist, and I advocate women's leadership, and I loved that shaking up society results in unabashed female leadership, at least in our show. We would benefit from further exploring that in the real world. That's something we have been deprived of, quite honestly. Michonne was very much someone I had to step up to, especially when she started to grow into herself and step away from her demons. When she became an item with Rick, Michonne was kind of more cool, and Rick was hot. The way she handles and assesses and comes to clarity about things -- I've always said, she's smarter than me, she's faster than me, and she's stronger than me. So I had to step into her agility and power. I always felt like I could learn from her as a woman, you know? When you were first learning how to be Michonne, didn't you practice her sword moves on your theater colleagues during the production of your play ""The Convert""?

I was in the basement of the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, and I had a practice sword made of wood. So I would be talking about the language components of the play while learning how to move my body with the sword. It was on my mind all the time. I felt like I needed to become one with ... not only with the character, but with how she moves and how her weapon moves in her hand. I create black female characters, and I'd never imagined a woman like this. So I wanted to give her my all, to do her justice. I would practice with the sword during every break, and I would constantly go back to the trainer to learn more. It was never, ""Oh, I'm great at this now."" It was a constant learning curve.

You're about to face another learning curve as a first-time showrunner. What lessons will you take from ""The Walking Dead"" -- any dos or don'ts? One of my goals is to show love and respect for the behind-the-scenes crew that most people don't get to see. Everyone's job on a show is so, so important. And I saw that attitude in action on ""The Walking Dead."" What do I not want? I don't want to do a tick check every night. I don't miss the ticks. Or the Georgia heat. It's such an important component of the show, to be in that environment, but we were literally sweating buckets and running through woods covered in gnats. There were times where it would be so hot, you'd be like, ""Am I about to faint?"" They were a little concerned, because I had been exerting myself, I was panting a little, and I had a new wig. But honestly, the heat of Georgia was a character in the show. There was nothing convenient about the world that those characters are in, you know? The dire circumstances are somewhat metaphorical. The show is metaphorically so many things -- the situations that these characters are going through and the way their lives can be completely altered by things unforeseen. That's something that definitely resonated for me. I created a play called ""Eclipsed,"" about Liberian women in a war zone, and all the things that happen to women in war zones -- how it affected them and their humanity and how they couldn't predict who they were going to become. And I started to connect it to ""The Walking Dead"" in the sense that Michonne felt like a woman in a war zone, and it raised the same question: Who did she have to become? It's about the choices you make in dire circumstances, when your humanity is tested and you have to fight for it. That's the core of the show -- the fight for your soul. It definitely resonates with the myriad unimaginable things that happen to human beings.","The actress, who stars as Michonne on the zombie thriller, discussed this week's episode and the future of her character.",c28cbbd6-d523-5ff6-9917-07af97947bfb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/arts/22danai1/22danai1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bfa863f96e8c961651854f50d0a692b4d4b1e79721561804187300bf19303182&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Danai Gurira as Michonne in ""The Walking Dead.""",c28cbbd6-d523-5ff6-9917-07af97947bfb,N24News/imgs/c28cbbd6-d523-5ff6-9917-07af97947bfb.jpg,3
Science,Some Dinosaur Eggs Took Six Months or More to Hatch,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/science/dinosaur-eggs.html,"The daily growth lines in the dentine of an embryonic tooth of Hypacrosaurus. By using a new technique on exceedingly rare fossils of unhatched dinosaur embryos, scientists determined that they took twice as long to hatch as bird eggs of a similar size.

For decades now, the drumbeat of dinosaur news has been their similarity to birds. They were warmblooded! They had feathers! And they're still around, because birds are actually dinosaurs. All true, but those that were nonavian dinosaurs, as they are now called, were not all beak and tweet. They were closely related to other living reptiles like crocodiles, and new findings about how long their eggs took to hatch bring that point home. Scientists reported on Monday that by using a new technique on exceedingly rare fossils of unhatched dinosaur embryos, they determined that those embryos took twice as long to hatch as bird eggs of a similar size. The embryo of a large duck-billed dinosaur took at least six months to hatch, and the eggs of larger dinosaurs may have taken even longer. The long incubation times complicate thinking about dinosaur behavior. While some kinds of dinosaurs may have tended their eggs and young, for others the difficulty of hanging around for most of a year to watch buried eggs would have been too much. And long incubation times mean slow reproduction, a definite disadvantage when a comet or asteroid slams into the planet, as happened 65 million years ago, leading to the extinction of dinosaurs and many other species. But not birds.

David J. Varricchio at Montana State University, who has studied fossilized dinosaur eggs and was one of the scientists who reviewed the paper for the journal, said the research took a new line of evidence -- embryonic tooth age -- and the technique could prove valuable in future studies. Scientific opinions have varied on incubation times. Dr. Varricchio and other scientists had studied how porous fossilized eggshells were, which led them to conclude that the vast majority of dinosaur eggs were buried. And that behavior, similar to living reptiles, suggested long incubation times, he said. But, Dr. Erickson said, most researchers thought that because dinosaurs were closely related to modern birds their incubation rates were birdlike.

Dr. Erickson used teeth from rare fossil embryos found in fossilized eggs that were about to hatch. He and his colleagues counted daily growth markers in the teeth, calculating that tooth growth accounted for about 40 percent of incubation time. He worked with Mark A. Norell, the head of paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, a co-author of the paper, to study a sample of teeth from 71- to 75-million-year-old embryos of Protoceratops, a sheep-sized dinosaur found in Mongolia. They came up with an incubation time of at least 83 days, almost three months. Dr. Erickson said the information from embryo teeth was the first direct evidence of how many days nonavian dinosaurs took to hatch. Darla K. Zelenitsky, a co-author and a paleontologist at the University of Calgary, gave him access to the embryo of an Hypacrosaurus, a duck-billed dinosaur that was about 30 feet long and laid eggs the size of soccer balls. The dinosaurs lived about 76 million years ago and laid their eggs in what is now Alberta, Canada. The incubation period for those eggs was at least 171 days, almost six months, the team concluded. David Ian Kay, a graduate student at Florida State, also contributed to the research.

Many dinosaurs were bigger than Hypacrosaurus, Dr. Erickson said, and because incubation increases with the size of the egg in both birds and reptiles, some eggs must have taken the greater part of a year just to hatch. Such long incubation periods raise all sorts of questions, Dr. Erickson said. How could dinosaurs have migrated, as some have suggested, if they spent most of a year with their eggs?

""Do we expect them to have parental care?"" Dr. Varricchio asked. He said that although there is evidence for parental care among some dinosaurs, those species had smaller eggs and most likely shorter incubation times. The very long incubation times would have meant dinosaur parents staying in one place for a whole year defending eggs and young. Long incubation periods also meant that the dinosaurs had to pick nesting sites that would be protected for many months from floods, drought and predation. They were also not reproducing as fast as other animals at the time of the mass extinction 65 million years ago, which may have contributed to their disappearance. Birds, for example, had already appeared and their incubation times were probably shorter. The incubation times would have been only one strike against the dinosaurs surviving a planetwide catastrophe, however. Dr. Erickson said they had other disadvantages. ""These animals were profligate wasters of energy,"" he said. They were big and warmblooded and ""even the smallest dinosaurs took over a year to mature,"" including time after hatching. ""The dinosaurs found themselves holding some bad cards,"" he said. ""They had a dead man's hand.""","Using embryonic tooth age, researchers have concluded that dinosaur eggs took twice as long to hatch as bird eggs.",0c5a6f57-d650-5793-b475-27701bf80afa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/03/science/03DINO2/03DINO2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=cc9c7c10847d85eed3478c0874f5a46af6240613ea5fa0b6309d74c7c5c6f272&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A hatchling Protoceratops andrewsi fossil from the Gobi Desert in Mongolia.,0c5a6f57-d650-5793-b475-27701bf80afa,N24News/imgs/0c5a6f57-d650-5793-b475-27701bf80afa.jpg,2
Health,"Nevada Halts Use of Rapid Coronavirus Tests in Nursing Homes, Citing Inaccuracies",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/health/nevada-covid-testing-nursing-homes.html,"Nevada has ordered its nursing facilities to immediately suspend the use of two rapid tests for the coronavirus, manufactured by companies Quidel and Becton, Dickinson and Company, after the tests' performance was found to be lacking, according to a directive issued on Friday by the state's department of health. Both tests are portable, simple and speedy, producing results in as little as 15 minutes and bypassing the need to send samples to a laboratory. The tests, which were distributed to nursing homes around the country in August by the federal government, were initially welcomed as a solution to the months of delays and equipment shortages that had stymied efforts to use laboratory-based tests to curb outbreaks. In September, an analysis by The New York Times found that the pandemic had so far claimed the lives of roughly 77,000 nursing home workers and residents -- some 40 percent of the nation's known Covid-19 fatalities. But a spate of false-positive results, in which the tests mistakenly designated healthy people as infected, triggered an urgent statewide order to discontinue use of the products ""until the accuracy of the tests can be further evaluated,"" the Nevada document said.

In submitting their tests to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency clearance, both BD and Quidel stated in their applications that their tests had no false positives. BD and Quidel's advertised accuracies are impressive, but ""they're also the ones who made the test,"" and are more likely to use it correctly, said Dr. Valerie Fitzhugh, a pathologist at Rutgers University. When confronted with the messiness of real-world conditions, rapid tests like these might not pass muster, she said. Shannon Litz, a spokeswoman for Nevada's department of health and human services, said in an email that the agency would be re-evaluating the test's performance before resuming their use. The decision had been made ""in the interest of protecting public health,"" Ms. Litz said. Shortly after the tests were rolled out across the state this summer, nursing homes began to report that people who had been evaluated by both the rapid tests and a more accurate laboratory test were receiving conflicting results. Whereas laboratory tests often rely on a highly reliable if slower technique called polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., that can detect very small amounts of coronavirus RNA, rapid tests like those made by BD and Quidel look for bits of coronavirus protein, or antigens, and more often make mistakes. Among 39 positive antigen test results from both BD and Quidel, 23 were found by P.C.R. to be negative -- an error rate of nearly 60 percent.

Lisa Sanders, director of media relations at LeadingAge, an association of nonprofit providers of aging services, said several nursing homes in other states had been experiencing issues with BD and Quidel's tests and reporting them to her organization and the American Health Care Association in recent weeks. Overall, false positives were rare. But more than two dozen facilities reported more than six discordant results -- enough to ""warrant an investigation,"" according to a September report by the A.H.C.A. and LeadingAge. ""There was an immediate effort to find out what's going on,"" Ms. Sanders said. Concern among her colleagues has been high, she added: ""If the tests aren't working, what are you going to do?"" Peter Iwen, director of the Nebraska Public Health Laboratory, said facilities in his state had also collected data suggesting that BD's test, called the Veritor, yielded a concerning number of false positives. Once further results on these and other rapid tests become available, he added, ""we may be shocked at how inaccurate the Covid-19 antigen tests are."" Quidel's rapid antigen tests have come under fire before. In August, a testing location in Manchester, Vt., reported a rash of false positives produced by the company's product, called the Sofia. In response, Douglas Bryant, president and C.E.O. of Quidel Corporation, told reporters it was ""highly likely"" the errors had arisen not with the company's antigen tests but with the P.C.R. tests used to confirm them, which were ""at risk of providing inaccurate results."" When contacted about the Nevada directive, Jeannine Sharp Mason, Quidel's director of marketing communications, said the company was aware of the situation and remained ""confident in the accuracy of our rapid antigen tests."" She added that Quidel was ""engaging with the state"" to ""determine the root cause of the alleged discordance."" Asked to clarify whether off-label use could have prompted false positives, Ms. Mason declined to comment further, adding only that ""nothing at this time tells us there is an issue with the product.""

Kristen Cardillo, BD's vice president of global communication, said the company was aware of the situation in Nevada and was ""conducting thorough investigations."" She added that ""based on the information in the directive and the total tests performed, we believe the rate of reported false positives is well within what we would expect for the BD Veritor System."" Representatives for the Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to requests for comment. Concerns have also been raised about the ability of antigen tests to accurately pinpoint infections, especially if administered during a period when a person harbors low levels of the coronavirus. BD's test is advertised as having a false negative rate of 16 percent. Quidel's is just above 3 percent. The directive from Nevada's department of health did not report whether the negative antigen test results from nursing homes -- there were nearly 3,700 such results -- had been confirmed by P.C.R. In a call with LeadingAge members on Monday, Adm. Brett Giroir, who has been leading the nation's testing efforts, said antigen tests were ""clearly a lifesaving option,"" and for many facilities the best test available, given the delays, expenses and shortages that had plagued P.C.R. tests. ""It is perfectly acceptable for congregate care, particularly nursing homes, to use an antigen test, even if they are, quote, off-label,"" Dr. Giroir said in the interview. ""Just because they don't have an authorization doesn't mean they're not good for it."" In response to questions about false positives, Dr. Giroir reminded LeadingAge members that in places where the coronavirus is scarce, false positives should be expected to outnumber true positives and do not necessarily invalidate the usefulness of a test. ""That's a function of the way life is,"" Dr. Giroir said. The halt to antigen testing in Nevada's nursing homes comes just days after health experts criticized the White House, which is now in the midst of a coronavirus outbreak, for a misguided overreliance on rapid testing. For months, officials used two products made by Abbott Laboratories, the ID NOW and the BinaxNOW, to test people without symptoms -- another off-label use -- while eschewing masks and physical distancing. In September, the White House also began distributing millions of BinaxNOW tests to communities across the country, including nursing homes around the country.

Dr. Geoffrey Baird, a pathologist at the University of Washington who recently received word of Nevada's pause, said he was worried that the growing number of infections at the White House might actually represent ""the best case scenario."" Other communities with fewer resources and less access to high-quality tests, he said, might fare far worse if an infected individual slipped through the diagnostic cracks. Rapid tests certainly have their place in the pandemic, Dr. Butler-Wu said, but more data was needed before the products were distributed in large numbers. Given the stumbling blocks that have already appeared, she said, ""can you imagine doing this on a national scale?""","Two tests made by Quidel and BD repeatedly delivered false-positive results, prompting the state to stop using them.",ebb10352-25e1-5051-a4a5-468f3dff953d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/science/00VIRUS-NEVADA01/00VIRUS-NEVADA01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=517952f14b85edd0d507d09a77dec7cd6f8eb4d49b22cf112ebc026df65d695e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Nevada has suspended the use of two companies' rapid coronavirus testing in nursing homes.,ebb10352-25e1-5051-a4a5-468f3dff953d,N24News/imgs/ebb10352-25e1-5051-a4a5-468f3dff953d.jpg,1
Global Business,Nuclear Woes Hurt Bottom Line at EDF,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/31/business/global/31energy.html,"PARIS -- The French energy giant EDF said Friday that its profitability had been dented by costs related to its U.S. nuclear ventures and that the construction of its latest-generation nuclear power plant in France would be delayed amid cost overruns. Announcing its first-half earnings -- in which it also pledged to sell electricity assets in Britain to Li Ka-shing, the richest man in Hong Kong -- EDF said its new E.P.R. plant in Flamanville, on the Normandy coast, would now cost EUR5 billion, or $6.5 billion, an increase of EUR1 billion. It also extended the target for beginning commercial output to 2014 from 2013. E.P.R. originally stood for European Pressurized Reactor. EDF, the largest Western power generator, reported a 47 percent drop in first-half net profit after making a provision of EUR1.1 billion related to financing delays on nuclear projects in the United States. Profit fell to EUR1.66 billion, from EUR3.1 billion a year earlier. The sale of the British power grid, for $9.1 billion, was designed to buffer the group from the effects of the delays in the French plant, the write-down in the United States and to pay debt related to its 2008 acquisition of British Energy. That deal cost PS12.5 billion, or $19.5 billion, and will give the French company a dominant role in the British nuclear industry.

In addition, EDF is expected soon to increase its stake in Areva, another French nuclear giant, perhaps raising its stake to between 10 percent and 15 percent from the current 2.5 percent. That deal is being negotiated by the state, which holds a majority in both companies, but is expected by analysts to cost EDF about EUR3 billion. ""During first six months of the year, the group was faced with numerous challenges,"" said Henri Proglio, EDF's chairman and chief executive. ""Despite an uncertain economical and regulatory environment, the group continued its development."" EDF's net debt was EUR 44.1 billion at the end June, up EUR1.6 billion from the end of 2009. Analysts stressed that, over all, the company is in solid financial shape. ""The company is still extremely profitable and does not face serious long-term problems,"" said Colette Lewiner head of the energy practice at CapGemini in Paris. EDF paid $4.5 billion in 2008 to enter the U.S. venture with Constellation Energy, negotiating just before the steep decline in asset prices. The two companies had also created a U.S. nuclear venture Unistar Nuclear Energy in 2007 for latest generation projects.

The EUR1.1 billion provision ""covers the risks of impairment of the assets of C.E.N.G., the investment in Unistar and certain future costs and risks associated with the project,"" the company said. It added it was still studying development of a latest generation reactor at Calvert Cliffs, Maryland, though it has yet to receive approval for a federal loan guarantee under a plan to support the sector announced by the administration of President Barack Obama. Constellation's chief executive, Mayo Shattuck, warned this week the Calvert Cliffs project could be put on hold if the guarantee do not emerge by summer's end. Constellation and EDF have spent $600 million on the proposed reactor. The Flamanville plant, with its E.P.R. technology from Areva, is the first new reactor to be built in France in a decade. It has suffered a series of set-backs after its original core design failed to meet safety criteria. Anti-nuclear activists are seeking to halt construction, arguing that design changes have invalidated the plant's original permit. Still, EDF said Friday that ""significant progress"" had been made at Flamanville, and that a number of critical stages had been completed. ""Flamanville is among the first reactors of its type to be built and it's a very complex design,"" Mrs. Lewiner said, ""there are some detailed engineering and construction management problems."" Areva has also been hit by overruns on an EPR plant that it is building in Olkiluoto, Finland. EDF is to build two EPR plants in China. The sale of the British distribution network covering the south-east and east of England to Cheung Kong Infrastructure and Hongkong Electric was agreed at PS5.8 billion.","The French energy giant cited costs related to its U.S. nuclear ventures and the construction of its latest generation nuclear power plant in France, which will be delayed until 2014.",7a98d789-2626-5820-aa51-206a5f9dc362,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/07/31/business/Energy/Energy-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=0fb94cfac38d18a2b433c23c92cba881c4ba0cd1f94d2f5870cbca3415b68624&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Completion of the EDF nuclear power plant being built in Flamanville, France, on the Normandy coast, will be delayed by a year because of increased costs.",7a98d789-2626-5820-aa51-206a5f9dc362,N24News/imgs/7a98d789-2626-5820-aa51-206a5f9dc362.jpg,24
Your Money,Balancing the Benefit and the Burden of Wealth,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/08/your-money/wealth-happiness.html,"So much for that old saw that money can't buy happiness. A new survey of people who have built significant wealth on their own found that money has actually bought them a lot of happiness. The majority of those surveyed -- 300 people with assets of $1 million to $20 million -- said they equated wealth first and foremost with peace of mind. Happiness came in second, with more than half of the respondents citing it. But life with money is not all Champagne and caviar. The respondents said that their wealth made them feel satisfied and grateful, but it also gave them a greater sense of responsibility. Many cherished the way their wealth had allowed them to spend time with their families, but some regretted losing the family time they had sacrificed in the pursuit of financial freedom. Such inherent tension between freedom and obligation ran, to varying degrees, through all age groups in the survey, which was conducted by CoreData Research in February and March.

Affluent Americans ages 25 to 65 were asked a series of questions about their attitudes toward wealth. Respondents were categorized by age, wealth level and whether they were business owners or employees. The more the responses were parsed by category, the more complications arose. About half of all respondents said the sacrifices they had made to accumulate such wealth meant they had spent less time with friends and family. That regret rose to nearly two-thirds for people at the higher end of the wealth range in the study. More than half of business owners felt it, too, outpacing people who had accumulated their wealth by working for someone else. ""It's the guilt over the time it took away from the family,"" said David Murphy, head of wealth advisory at Boston Private, a wealth management firm that commissioned the study. ""There's a lot of emotion built into growing the business and the time it takes to do that. The employees also become part of the extended family."" The results of the survey, titled ""The Why of Wealth,"" hint at what the more sophisticated advisers already know: The days of focusing solely on investment returns are on the wane.

I talked to some people who fit in this wealth cohort. What I found is something that won't surprise anyone who struggles to pay their bills: More money is better than less. But that financial comfort does not make the feelings around wealth any less difficult. Jane Daly, who was passionate about public transportation during her days growing up in Providence, R.I., turned a public sector transit career into a lucrative private sector venture when she and two partners started Alternate Concepts, which operates and maintains transportation systems. ""Wealth wasn't my goal,"" said Ms. Daly, 62. ""I wanted the company to be successful because we had a lot of families depending on us. But I'm grateful my career ended in such a way that the wealth gave me the freedom I wouldn't have had otherwise."" That freedom allows her to support and run an educational nonprofit called the Rising Stars Foundation in Puerto Rico. Others I talked to also said they felt an obligation be a force for change. ""For me, at an early age, wealth was about being able to create the change you wish to see in the world,"" said Elizabeth Galbut Perelman, 29, a co-founder of SoGal Ventures, which has invested in more than 50 companies in the past two years. Ms. Galbut Perelman said her mother had to give up her career as a doctor when she temporarily lost her sight while performing surgery. It was a complication of multiple sclerosis.

That motivated her to focus on how wealth can be harnessed to fund women-owned companies that are looking to create change. She has invested in companies like EverlyWell, which provides affordable at-home lab testing, and Winky Lux, a cosmetics purveyor in New York. ""Being an employee of a big company wasn't going to generate the wealth and flexibility that I desired,"" she said of her time at Deloitte, where she worked after college. ""I wanted to figure out how to solve some problems and do it to the best of my ability."" For some younger millionaires, wealth does not equate to yachts and homes. ""Independence is the first word that comes to mind, and freedom goes hand in hand with it,"" said Marc Hustvedt, 38, chief executive of Above Average, a digital entertainment company, who has also created and sold companies. ""In my childhood, it might have meant the trappings of wealth -- houses, cars, status. Now as I'm older, with more business experience, I understand it as income stream."" As boring as income stream sounds, it's what allows independence. ""The whole guiding principle was, I liked to be independent,"" said Tom Aley, an entrepreneur who had three young children when he quit a high-paying job at Reed Elsevier Ventures to start a company called Generate. ""I could do more things. I didn't have to be beholden to anyone.""

He even managed to persuade one of his brothers to join him at Generate in 2004. Four years later, they sold the company to Dow Jones. This is where wealth can bring freedom. Mr. Hustvedt said his flexible schedule allowed him to spend time with two children and still run a company. He said there were other social issues he would like to tackle, like the growing wealth gap, but he felt he had little time to address them.

Time is a similar lament for Ms. Galbut Perelman. ""You're sacrificing time with your friends, time with your loved ones, time with your own health,"" she said. ""If I'm working at my business 16 hours a day, how do I have a sense of wellness and also take care of my employees? Business owners aren't getting that support in their community."" For Mr. Aley, though, having more freedom now, at age 52, is worth any sacrifices he made earlier in his career. He now has better control of his time and how he spends it. ""Sometimes, it doesn't always work out, but for me, but it's invaluable,"" he said. ""It also means I can go to lunch with my wife and it doesn't have to be confined to a Saturday, and I can see my kids' games."" The Boston Private survey found that business owners in particular felt the burdens of wealth more intensely than people who grew wealthy working at companies. These entrepreneurs said they felt pressure from other people's expectations as well as judgments about their wealth. But some people I talked to also mentioned the gratification they felt, even if it was tinged with regret. Ms. Daly said she was pleased with how her wealth had allowed her to give back to a group of children in Puerto Rico, where her company managed a rail system. But how she thought about wealth and financial independence earlier in her career left her with one regret: She had neglected her personal life. ""I turned down a couple of proposals,"" she said. ""I didn't have a family."" Still, she remains fulfilled by nonprofit work with children that would not be possible without the money she made in business. ""I have more children than anyone I know,"" she said. ""There is so much joy in what I'm doing now.""","Can money buy happiness?

Music,"Joseph Shabalala, Ladysmith Black Mambazo Founder, Dies at 78",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/arts/music/joseph-shabalala-dead.html,"Joseph Shabalala, the gentle-voiced South African songwriter whose choir, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, brought Zulu music to listeners worldwide, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Pretoria. He was 78. The cause was not immediately known, but his health had deteriorated after he had back surgery in 2013, said the group's manager, Xolani Majozi, who announced the death. Mr. Shabalala began leading choral groups at the end of the 1950s. By the early '70s his Ladysmith Black Mambazo -- in Zulu, ""the black ax of Ladysmith,"" a town in KwaZulu-Natal Province -- had become one of South Africa's most popular groups, singing about love, Zulu folklore, rural childhood memories, moral admonitions and Christian faith. Ladysmith Black Mambazo's collaborations with Paul Simon on his 1986 album ""Graceland,"" on the tracks ""Homeless"" and ""Diamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,"" introduced South African choral music to an international pop audience.

Joseph Shabalala -- his full name was Bhekizizwe Joseph Siphatimandla Mxoveni Mshengu Bigboy Shabalala -- was born on Aug. 28, 1941, near the town of Ladysmith, where his parents, Jonathan Mluwane Shabalala and Nomandla Elina Shabalala, worked on a white-owned farm. In 1958 he left to find factory work in the port city of Durban, about 200 miles to the southeast. There he sang with the group Highlanders before returning to Ladysmith and starting a group, the Black Ones, with some of his brothers and cousins in 1960. Mr. Shabalala often said that a series of dreams he had in 1964 had led him to reshape the music of the group, which became Ladysmith Black Mambazo. He refined an a cappella Zulu choir style called isicathamiya -- ""stalking style"" -- which had grown out of song-and-dance competitions in hostels for migrant mineworkers, an urban adaptation of rural traditions.

Ladysmith Black Mambazo triumphed at local competitions in the 1960s. In 1970, it performed for a live radio broadcast from Johannesburg. That performance soon led to a recording contract, and the group released dozens of albums on South African labels, adapting Zulu traditional songs. The group was invited to perform at festivals in Germany beginning in 1980, and it appeared in ""Rhythm of Resistance,"" a documentary about South African music by Jeremy Marre, which is where Mr. Simon first heard them. When he met Mr. Shabalala in Johannesburg, Mr. Simon invited him to collaborate. ""He came to me like a child asking his father, 'Can you teach me something?,'"" Mr. Shabalala recalled of Mr. Simon in the liner notes to the expanded 2016 reissue of ""Graceland."" ""He was so polite. That was my first time to hug a white man."" The group recorded ""Homeless,"" merging Mr. Simon's material with a Zulu wedding song, at Abbey Road Studios in London in 1985. The next year, in May, Ladysmith Black Mambazo performed the song, which had not yet been released, with Mr. Simon on ""Saturday Night Live.""

The group resumed its own recording and touring career with vastly expanded opportunities. Through the next decades, Ladysmith Black Mambazo appeared on ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Tonight Show."" It performed when Nelson Mandela received his Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 and a year later at Mr. Mandela's inauguration as president of South Africa. The group appeared on Broadway providing music for a 1993 play about apartheid, ""The Song of Jacob Zulu,"" and Mr. Shabalala collaborated with the Steppenwolf Theater Company of Chicago and the playwright Ntozake Shange on a musical based on one of his songs, ""Nomathemba."" Ladysmith Black Mambazo also recorded steadily, collaborating with pop and rock musicians on the 2006 album ""Long Walk to Freedom"" and reaching back to Mr. Shabalala's childhood with ""Songs From a Zulu Farm"" in 2011. He announced his retirement from Ladysmith Black Mambazo in 2014; three of his sons -- Sibongseni, Thamsanqa and Thulani -- are in the current lineup of the group. Mr. Shabalala's wife of three decades, Nellie, was murdered in 2002. In addition to his three sons, his survivors include his wife, Thokozile Shabalala; two daughters; four more sons; and 36 grandchildren.","His choral group acquired an international following and won Grammys after collaborating with Paul Simon on the album ""Graceland.""",43d146bc-d9a6-5073-b578-a15296306515,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/12/obituaries/11Shabalala1-print/11Shabalala1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=d828e768f55f168485c0f4f6cca52e8ddc227d01759d49ad584c33eeae241906&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Joseph Shabalala, the founder and leader of Ladysmith Black Mambazo, in performance in Johannesburg in 2002.

Style,James Comey Still Looks the Part,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/style/james-comey-g-man-movies.html,"James B. Comey is currently a lot of things: ex-director of the F.B.I., ex-United States attorney, author, moral crusader, ""slimeball"" (according to President Trump) and so ubiquitous that he is impossible to ignore. But whether you think he is a heroic truth teller or a self-aggrandizing grandstander, and there are arguments for both, what is indisputable is that he is also something else: a 21st-century embodiment of a 20th-century archetype rooted deep in American mythology. The ultimate G-man. With all the associations and expectations that image implies. If the Trump administration is its own reality show, Mr. Comey represents a character from a different Hollywood tradition. And if the goal of his book, ""A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,"" is to define what ""ethical leadership"" looks like -- well. He's providing an answer in more ways than one.

And he is only going to get more omnipresent, thanks to a media blitz that includes appearances on ""Today,"" ""The View,"" ""The Rachel Maddow Show"" and CNN, and a book tour that lasts until May 25, with stops in New York; Chicago; Portland, Ore.; Washington; and Los Angeles (among other cities). Demand for some of those events is so high that tickets are being resold on sites like StubHub for hundreds of dollars. Mr. Comey stares out from small screens and promotional pictures everywhere -- trailers, social media and reviews. He is steely eyed, often glancing upward, as to a higher goal, or resolutely ahead; dark, brush-cut hair just beginning to be smudged with gray; the squareness of his jawline matched only by the squareness of his shoulders, his 6-foot-8 frame often draped in layers of true blue. Even in interviews, he rarely smiles (though there were a few grins with Mr. Colbert). His under-eye pouches speak of sleepless nights worrying about the soul of the executive branch and the burdens of doing the right thing. Warner Bros. couldn't have cast him better if it had tried. The look is in many ways the culmination of a cinematic romance with bureaucratic iconography that began in 1935 with James Cagney's film ""'G' Men,"" and continued through Kevin Costner as Eliot Ness in Brian De Palma's ""The Untouchables."" Mr. Comey fits neatly within this predetermined, easily read lens. It's both comforting and slightly unnerving to see how closely he resembles the fictive embodiments of his role. Life imitating art imitating life.

In many ways, these men have formed our fantasy of the ultimate upstanding lawman: who subjugates his persona to his ideals and his institution by assuming the uniform of lore. At a time when casual Friday and the rights of the individual to self-expression through clothes are on the rise, it's a clear pledge of allegiance to a different convention. It's a character Mr. Comey has been honing for years, since he took the oath of office as F.B.I. director in 2013, and immortalized in his testimony before Congress last June, when he appeared in a dark suit, pristine white shirt and dark red tie, caught forever in multiple cameras and the watching imagination.

Even when he takes off his tie, as he has for his recent TV appearances, or swaps the jacket for a collared shirt in a dark shade, as he did for his Twitter page and his author photograph, as if to acknowledge his role as a private citizen, his clothes still convey sincerity and sobriety. There's nothing really casual about them. On Mr. Colbert's show, he wore a black shirt and matching trousers with a gray jacket finished in black buttons: Johnny Cash, the lawyer version. You can take the G-man out of the suit (and the job), but not the suit out of the former G-man.

This has the Pavlovian effect of giving his words a believability (at least for those who buy into the cultural stereotype). It helps counteract the (understandable) perception that he is limelight seeking and self-promotional, because even as he stands out there on his own, he is connected to a much bigger tradition. And it's an effective visual counterpart to the efforts of the White House and the Republican National Committee to label him as ""Lyin' Comey."" In the drama of opposition, where Mr. Comey is increasingly casting himself, and being cast by others, as the mission-driven antipode to the president, his appearance acts as a kind of supporting argument. On the one hand is Mr. Trump, whose hair is an elaborate construction to hide a bald spot, whose skin is shaded to disguise whatever its true pallor may be, whose clothes billow around his body as if to conceal the girth beneath. On the other is Mr. Comey, whose optics imply discipline, self-control and lack of guile. In case you missed it, he drew attention to the point himself, noting to Mr. Stephanopoulos and in his book that when he met Mr. Trump he was struck by his ""impressively"" coifed hair that ""looked to be"" all his own (but maybe it wasn't), his too-long tie and the white pouches under his eyes, perhaps from goggles worn while fake tanning. (Former President Barack Obama, he writes, looked ""thinner"" in person.)","The former F.B.I. director has made the rounds this week, offering his take on what ""ethical leadership"" means.

Health,Smokers Urged to Switch to E-Cigarettes by British Medical Group,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/28/health/e-cigarettes-vaping-quitting-smoking-royal-college-of-physicians.html,"Taking a stance sharply at odds with most American public health officials, a major British medical organization urged smokers to switch to electronic cigarettes, saying they are the best hope in generations for people addicted to tobacco cigarettes to quit. The recommendation, laid out in a report published Thursday by the Royal College of Physicians, summarizes the growing body of science on e-cigarettes and finds that their benefits far outweigh the potential harms. It concludes resoundingly that, at least so far, the devices are helping people more than harming them, and that the worries about them -- including that using them will lead young people to eventually start smoking traditional cigarettes -- have not come to pass. ""This is the first genuinely new way of helping people stop smoking that has come along in decades,"" said John Britton, director of the U.K. Center for Tobacco and Alcohol Studies at the University of Nottingham, who led the committee that produced the report. E-cigarettes, he said, ""have the potential to help half or more of all smokers get off cigarettes. That's a huge health benefit, bigger than just about any medical intervention."" That conclusion is likely to be controversial in the United States, where arguments about e-cigarettes have jolted the traditionally low-key public health community.

E-cigarettes deliver nicotine without the harmful tar and chemicals that cause cancer. Some public health experts see e-cigarettes as the first real chance in years for 40 million addicted Americans to quit. But others, including the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, have focused on the potential dangers of e-cigarettes, for example that they could extend smoking habits, that they could be a gateway to traditional cigarettes for children, or that their vapor could to turn out to have long-term health effects. ""These guys, in my view, are going off a cliff,"" said Stanton A. Glantz, a professor of medicine at the University of California who has been outspoken in his criticism of e-cigarettes. ""They are taking England into a series of policies that five years from now they all will really regret. They are turning England into this giant experiment on behalf of the tobacco industry."" But some American public health experts applauded the report, saying the emphasis on policies that reduce harm, such as recommending that smokers try e-cigarettes or giving clean needles to drug users, would probably save more lives. ""This is two countries taking pretty much diametrically opposed positions,"" said Kenneth E. Warner, a professor of public health at the University of Michigan School of Public Health. ""One is focused exclusively on the hypothetical risks, none of which have been established. The other is focusing on potential benefits."" He added, ""The British are saying, 'Let's see how we can help the main smokers today, who by the way are largely poor and less educated, and let's not focus so much on kids, who may or may not be sickened by this 40 years down the line.' ""

Smoking is still the largest cause of preventable death in the United States, with more than 480,000 people a year dying of smoking-related illnesses. In past decades, smoking was spread throughout society, but today in Britain and the United States, smokers tend to be poor, less educated, or mentally ill. E-cigarettes, now a multibillion-dollar market, have gained popularity faster than the federal government has managed to regulate them. The Food and Drug Administration has not yet published final rules that would subject them to federal oversight. A spokesman for the C.D.C. said the agency would not comment on any report other than its own. He reiterated the C.D.C. position on e-cigarettes: ""There is currently no conclusive scientific evidence supporting the use of e-cigarettes as a safe and effective cessation tool at the population level. The science thus far indicates most e-cigarette users continue to smoke conventional cigarettes."" But the report cites evidence from Britain that e-cigarettes have helped with quitting. Robert West, director of Tobacco Studies at University College London, analyzed monthly household survey data going back to 2009 in England, and concluded that use of an e-cigarette during an attempt to quit was associated with a 50 percent increase in the chances of success, compared with using no aid or using a product such as nicotine patches without any professional counseling. He estimated that around 20,000 smokers in England quit smoking in 2014 because of e-cigarettes. Professor Glantz cited his recent analysis as evidence that e-cigarettes in fact reduce the chances someone will quit smoking. The Royal College of Physicians is a respected doctors' group that helps set medical standards in Britain. It issued a groundbreaking report on the dangers of smoking in 1962 that was seen as the precursor of the American surgeon general's report of 1964 that linked smoking with cancer. The organization's last major report on reducing harm from tobacco use came out in 2007, before e-cigarettes became mainstream, and its authors said the new one was an attempt to evaluate their benefits and harms. The report walks through a decade of science, listing studies that find in favor of e-cigarettes as well as studies that do not. It asserts that e-cigarettes are only 5 percent as harmful as traditional cigarettes, a conclusion that some American experts say has been lost in the United States in the rush to condemn e-cigarettes. It states bluntly that long-term effects of nicotine are likely to be minimal. ""The emergence of e-cigarettes has generated a massive opportunity for a consumer as well as a health care-led revolution in the way that nicotine is used in society,"" the report said. As the technology of e-cigarettes improves, ""so the vision of a society that is free from tobacco smoking, and the harm that smoking causes, becomes more realistic.""",The Royal College of Physicians summarized the growing body of science on e-cigarettes and found that their benefits far outweigh the potential harms.,87f34452-dcc1-5b3c-9ca5-4b4affc07e74,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/28/science/28ECIG/28ECIG-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=58e6a95eaa47091572220ddc529cf3b2913c2a5fdb3ff264606d7dce1b68f6c8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A man smoking an e-cigarette at a coffee shop in London.

Art & Design,Art Disappears in Private Hands. Can Social Media Resurface It?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/14/arts/design/art-collection-digital-museum.html,"The private art collection of Roberto Toscano and his wife, Nadia Toscano-Palon, features works by artists including Daniel Turner, Anish Kapoor, James Turrell and Oscar Tuazon. Since 2012, the collection has grown to more than 100 works, which are partly in storage because of renovations -- and, like most private collections, are rarely seen by anyone outside of the couple's immediate circle. This is a problem for many collectors, Mr. Toscano included, who want to show their work to broader audiences or believe that there's a public good to sharing the work they own. Though collectors at the highest end of the market are increasingly opening private museums, it can be difficult to afford or staff a space. Private collections can often be so opaque, Mr. Toscano said, that even artists don't know where their own works are -- part of his motivation to make that general information public. ""If I don't put them in some kind of public database, these works essentially disappear from the planet,"" he said. Enter Collecteurs, a website and social media platform that's boldly billing itself as ""The Collective Museum of Private Collections."" Collecteurs, based out of the New Museum's NEW INC., a cultural incubator, is a public benefit corporation with a stated mission to bring artwork into the light -- at least, the light of the internet. Its founders are Jessica and Evrim Oralkan , married collectors who became overwhelmed by the size of their own trove of art. They were struggling to manage it, and share it with the public. ""You get to a point where your walls can't take anymore art,"" Mr. Oralkan said.

The Oralkans have uploaded their personal collection online, as have Mr. Toscano and about 1,200 others. Anyone with a computer can now scroll through images of the work they own. Using and accessing it at a basic level is free. But users can sign up for two higher-tier plans (one at $15 a month and another at $125 a month) that provide access to features like passes to art fairs and the opportunity to to be interviewed for the site's editorial platform. In addition to sharing, art collectors are seeking tools to organize growing collections, connect online with gallerists and curators and, perhaps, to humblebrag about what's on their walls. ""Collecting used to almost be like a private club with people who were very traditional in their privacy and comportment,"" Ronald Varney, an independent fine art adviser in New York, said in an interview this week . ""Nowadays, it's often, 'How much publicity can I get out of this?'"" Collecteurs is attempting to harness the energy of social media without all of its associated noise, and offer a window into the secretive and exclusive world of private collections. Though the amount of art in private hands is unquantifiable, art sales have been increasing, reaching $67.4 billion in 2018, much of it passing between private hands. Mr. Varney called the world of private collections a ""murky universe"" since private sales are not reported, and auction houses are not required to divulge the names of winning bidders.

Merely by its nature, Collecteurs has an obvious limitation: The art can only be seen online. ""Not everybody has the resources to open a private museum,"" Mr. Oralkan said. ""So people are looking for alternative options, and those are most likely going to be digital."" Collecteurs is trying to be at once a management software; a social media platform; an online magazine with plans for print books down the road; and, more nebulously, an online museum for the public. Its founders say that the platform isn't geared toward buying and selling, but rather it's another way of getting access to information about where art is. The concept of a ""digital museum"" isn't really new. Many museums have long been digitizing their collections so that anyone with an internet connection can scroll through images of the art. But when does something grow from a collection of images online to an online museum, and does Collecteurs qualify? ""This is really not a museum by any stretch of the definition,"" said Claire Bishop, a professor of art history at the Graduate Center at the City University of New York, who has researched and written about the effects of digital technology on visual art. She said the lack of emphasis on research, the shortage of contextual information about objects and the absence of extensive curation make Collecteurs more social network than museum. The information on the website is self-reported, so it can be as robust or as limited as a collector chooses; often, collectors include dimensions, medium, artist, materials and exhibition history. Sometimes, they add notes and can curate digital exhibitions of their works. ""If the minimum definition of a digital museum is a collection of jpegs online, then an online archive like Artstor is the greatest digital museum on earth,"" Ms. Bishop said, referring to a nonprofit digital image library that has amassed millions of images for scholarly use. The use of the word ""museum,"" she said, is a misnomer, and lends the project cachet while misrepresenting its aims.

Mr. Oralkan emphasized that Collecteurs is a hybrid platform, one that's driven by aspirations to change how art can be seen and shared. ""I think we really have a chance to recreate the idea of what a museum can be,"" he said. Ms. Oralkan said, ""If we're looking at either not being seen at all or being seen digitally, digital is a very strong point to make."" In recent years, Instagram has become a favored way for collectors to share and search for new work. It has also helped some artists, like Cj Hendry, start their careers outside of traditional channels . Mr. Toscano used to rely on Instagram to seek out artists, but he said he's grown frustrated with the algorithm. ""Every four posts someone is trying to sell me something that has nothing to do with any of my interests,"" he said. Collecteurs is semi-exclusive; anyone can join and post images, but some members are preapproved based on the content of the collection, allowing them to show up in the site's search function. (Quality matters to the founders: ""We don't want a Mickey Mouse collector showing Donald Duck art, "" Mr. Oralkan said.) Viewers can search the site -- by artist, by collection, by keyword, by hashtag -- a feature that Mr. Toscano has used to search for other work by the artists he collects -- art that might be in other collections .

But not everyone is interested in showing off what they have in vaults or on their walls. ""People aren't necessarily looking for the sharing aspect,"" Justin Anthony, one of the founders of a Denver-based company called Artwork Archive, said. Theirs is a cloud-based inventory system, used by artists, collectors and large institutions for organization and management: Users track what they have and where the works are, along with deeds of title and insurance papers. ""I would say there's kind of a sexy, interesting aspect to this and a practical aspect. The unsexy side, the management side, is a more common itch than the desire to share.""

She said that they had instituted a feature to allow people to share anonymously, and that as the platform has grown, it has been easier to convince prospective users to join the site. The two are planning a book of uploaded collections , ""Socially Conscious Collectors,"" which has been an incentive for users, especially given the death of some glossy home magazines -- where homes and art might have been featured in splashy spreads. ( Ad revenue in magazines fell to around $28 billion in 2017 from $46 billion dollars in 2007, according to Statista, an industry newsletter.) Mr. Varney said he does believe social media will open up the art market and add more transparency . ""Things just sort of vanish into private collections,"" he said. ""When things appear on the market, especially older things that have been off the market forever, it's almost like a discovery story.""",Private art collections are notoriously secretive. A collective website aims to make them viewable by all.,37c22ecf-9285-5a83-b625-bd9c1ffb0997,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/15/arts/00collecteurs1/00collecteurs1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=23b6c0d582243870132303b12b48c523fe5e66bc322a6dcacfa152709f3b417f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jessica and Evrim Oralkan, the founders of Collecteurs, a website that bills itself as &ldquo;The Collective Museum of Private Collections.&rdquo;",37c22ecf-9285-5a83-b625-bd9c1ffb0997,N24News/imgs/37c22ecf-9285-5a83-b625-bd9c1ffb0997.jpg,14
Books,"A Book So Far Ahead of Its Time, It Took 87 Years to Find a Publisher",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/books/claude-mckay-romance-marseille-harlem-renaissance.html,"""In recent years, we have taken a much more expansive look at the Harlem Renaissance,"" said Venetria K. Patton of Purdue University, who co-edited the 2001 anthology ""Double-Take: A Revisionist Harlem Renaissance Anthology."" ""The race narrative is still an important aspect of the Renaissance. But there were questions of sexuality, of gender, of how to position oneself in an environment that didn't see you as equal,"" that have historically received less attention.

[ Read our review of Claude McKay's ""Romance in Marseille."" ]

Why? During the Renaissance, mainstream narratives of the movement were shaped by its complicated relationship with white readers. The Renaissance was made economically possible partially through the patronage of wealthy white individuals like Charlotte Osgood Mason, and could therefore be constrained by their interests and their prejudices. Led by figures like Du Bois, many of the Renaissance's participants saw the movement as a way to address white audiences, and encourage them ""to re-evaluate black lives as being equal,"" according to Jean-Christophe Cloutier, co-editor of ""Amiable With Big Teeth."" Efforts to redirect the movement to black audiences, and to write about a wider array of concerns, were largely relegated to the Renaissance's queer subculture.

McKay belonged both to that subculture and to the movement's mainstream. His 1928 novel ""Home to Harlem"" was the first American best seller by a black writer. But despite being seen as one of the Renaissance's guiding lights, McKay -- Jamaican, bisexual, a Marxist who grew disenchanted with communism before the rest of his cohort -- also brought an outsider's critical gaze to the movement. He was concerned not only with whom their target audience should be but also with how they depicted class politics, particularly in a queer context. Maxwell, one of the editors of ""Romance in Marseille,"" notes that the novel's most overt gay characters include a black female prostitute and ""a dock worker socialist white male stud."" That was a remarkable departure from conventions of the Renaissance, in which most queer relationships were depicted in ""a genteel context of gay male instruction,"" as Maxwell put it. Holcomb, the book's other editor, pointed out that ""Romance in Marseille"" depicts great freedom in working-class queer life. ""The queer characters are not portrayed as being exotic or subcultural,"" he said. ""They're just ordinary working people.""

McKay's vision of a black cultural movement that transcended national, class and sexual barriers was not unique. Several of his contemporaries who similarly challenged the Renaissance's norms have also experienced recent revivals. Two novels by Ann Petry (including ""The Street,"" her revolutionary novel of black, female working-class life) were reissued by the Library of America in 2019. Jeffrey C. Stewart's 2018 biography ""The New Negro: The Life of Alain Locke"" brought renewed attention to the other most significant gatekeeper of the Renaissance, looking specifically at the influence of his queerness. ""There Is Confusion,"" by Jessie Redmon Fauset, the longtime editor of the official N.A.A.C.P. magazine The Crisis, whose work was often disregarded because of her gender, is being reissued on Feb. 11, the same day ""Romance in Marseille"" will be released. And two previously unpublished books by Zora Neale Hurston have come out in the last two years.","Claude McKay's novel ""Romance in Marseille"" deals with queer love, postcolonialism and the legacy of slavery. It also complicates ideas about the Harlem Renaissance.",7311d1c2-7e2d-5a48-a28b-5aabf337917a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/07/books/03McKay1/03McKay1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=534&w=1019&s=03254c21673ad99cfc388ff6f8e29be9eee0951a21cec1fb8ce7bc55c9b2fd88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Claude McKay, browsing Parisian book stalls early in the 20th century.

Movies,Spike Lee Reacts to His First Best-Director Nomination,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/spike-lee-oscar-nomination.html,"Lee said it was no secret that his nomination took 30 years in the making. ""But I'm not complaining! It's a joyous day.""

Three years ago, Spike Lee made headlines when he announced that he'd be skipping the Oscars -- a protest, he said, of the academy's historical failure to honor artists of color. Now, the academy is coming to him. ""BlacKkKLansman,"" Lee's 21st feature, not counting documentaries, was nominated for six Academy Awards on Tuesday, including best picture and best director. It's the first directing nomination for Lee, who, by almost any other measure, has been widely regarded as one of his medium's most important artists -- and one of his industry's most energetic ombudsmen -- for at least two decades. [Read more about the nominations | Check out the full list of nominees | See the snubs and surprises.] His classic films of the late '80s and '90s (""She's Gotta Have It,"" ""Do the Right Thing,"" ""Malcolm X"") reshaped American cinema, helped make stars of Denzel Washington and Samuel L. Jackson, and turned Lee himself into a new kind of celebrity -- part auteur, part public servant, part sneaker pitchman. But he's had a fraught relationship with film's major honorary body from almost the beginning of his career. At the 1990 Oscars, ""Do the Right Thing"" lost out in two categories (best screenplay and best supporting actor, for Danny Aiello) and fell short of a best picture nomination, awarded that year to ""Driving Miss Daisy."" In 2015, during an acceptance speech for an honorary prize at the academy's Governors Awards, Lee implored those in attendance to ""get smart"" about diversity and foster a creative work force that can ""reflect what this country looks like.""

The same night of that speech, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, then the academy's president, announced a multiyear campaign to diversify its membership. The move wasn't enough to convince Lee to attend the 2016 ceremony (he went to a Knicks game instead), but he credits Isaacs's efforts for clearing room for ""BlacKkKlansman."" The movie, a critical and box office hit based on the true story of a black police officer who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan, has turned the director, at 61, into the toast of the town once again. Lee spoke about ""BlacKkKlansman,"" the state of the Hollywood and, naturally, the state of the White House, from his home in New York, where he watched Tuesday's announcements with his wife, two children and one flustered dog. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. Well, it feels very good. We're very pleased. We were all watching, sitting in bed, jumping up and down. The dog was barking at us -- she didn't know what was going on [laughs] -- but it's a good day. It's a good day. You've said that ever since your experience with ""Do the Right Thing,"" you haven't held out hope for recognition from the academy. What does it mean to be nominated now, 30 years later? Well, any time there's an award, you should think about who's voting. And the membership of the academy today is much more diverse than it was back then. #OscarsSoWhite definitely prodded the academy to open up its membership, and that's why I think that you see films by people of color are getting the recognition now that they didn't get in the past.

A lot of people worked on this film, in front and behind the camera. And also the marketing -- this whole Oscars campaign. I couldn't have done it alone. People were busting their ass. Everyone has asked me from the beginning, ""How do you feel about where you are with this film?"" I love where we are. We're the long-shot. And I like being in that position. I've always been the underdog, always. And you could quote me: We're the dark horse in the race. Pun intended.

Does any part of you feel like it's overdue? I mean, look, it's no secret. 30 years is a long [expletive] time. But I'm not complaining! It's a joyous day. I'm blessed for this day. Blessed for the recognition. And there's a feeling that it's not just the people that worked on this film [that have earned recognition], it's the people that have been working on my films since 1986. You've made all kinds of films -- some independent, some with studios, some that you wrote, some that were written by others -- was there anything about ""BlacKkKlansman"" that you thought had the potential to resonate in a different way? Well, when Jordan Peele called me up and gave me the pitch ""Black man infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan,"" I was intrigued, because with the absurdity of that premise comes humor. Kevin Willmott [a co-writer of the film] and I knew that if we could use the movie to connect the past with the present, we could do something that connected with people. And it was a tough thing to do. But it was successful, and it speaks directly to the world we live in today with this guy in the White House. Today, when 800,000 Americans need a break as we go into another week of this temper tantrum about how this guy wants his money for his wall. A wall he wants to be built upon the border of a country that he says [is home to] rapists, murders and drug dealers. And that they're gonna pay for! Which is not true. This film deals directly with the madness and the mayhem of this Looney Tunes, cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs world [laughs]. And I feel that many years to come, when historians search for a piece of art that clearly shows what is happening today, ""BlacKkKlansman"" will be one of the first things they look at. Because this film is on the right side of history.

When you think about the journey ""BlacKkKlansman"" has had, what do you think it says about where the industry is today and where it's going? Well, none of this would have been possible if the academy did not make the heroic move, and the right move to open up its ranks to better reflect what this country looks like. And I applaud the former president, Cheryl Boone Isaacs, for being the one to champion that. I don't think that was an easy thing to do. You once famously said that it's easier as a black man to become the president of the United States than it is to become the head of a movie studio. There still aren't many black people at the heads of movie studios. [Laughs] And I still think I'm right on that. I think that one of the final frontiers to complete diversity has to be among the gatekeepers. The people at the head of various media outlets who decide what they're making and not making. Until there's diversity brought to that, we're still going to have issues. In 1990, the first time you were nominated for an Academy Award, ""Driving Miss Daisy"" won best picture. This year, ""BlacKkKlansman"" is up against ""Green Book,"" which some people have compared to ""Driving Miss Daisy."" Do you see a coincidence? I have a policy today where I'm not talking about anybody else's films that were nominated. But I will acknowledge that comparison has been made, yes.","The filmmaker behind ""BlacKkKlansman"" likes being the underdog: ""We're the dark horse in the race, pun intended.""",ffaf29b1-cebb-51ac-8a72-8296f4beb448,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/26/arts/26oscar-lee1/23oscar-lee1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=eb4cd23cbe122d286121182960b3c6146f854a63df562534832373d78f7bbb26&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lee said it was no secret that his nomination took 30 years in the making. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m not complaining!

Opinion,Coronavirus Has Taught Us More About Trump Than We Wanted to Know,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/opinion/coronavirus-trump-cuomo-biden.html,"Coronavirus Has Taught Us More About Trump Than We Wanted to Know

Bret Stephens: Gail, I'm having a weird disconnect. On Friday, I rode my bike all the way up to the George Washington Bridge. The weather was perfect and New York had never looked so glorious. The next day, which was dank and rainy, Donald Trump raised the possibility of quarantining New York, along with parts of the tristate area. I experience this presidency as a cross between Stephen King's ""It"" and ""The Truman Show."" Nonetheless, Donald Trump's popularity is rising. What gives? Gail Collins: I still adhere to the rule that there is no situation so bad that Donald Trump can't make it worse. Bret: If he had been the designer of the Titanic, there would have been fewer lifeboats. Gail: Or his minions would have forgotten to check for holes.

But even as we're seeing him flounder, people want to believe they have a leader who knows what he's doing in this crisis. So it's not surprising his polls have ticked up. Although actually Trump's popularity hasn't risen all that much considering the intensity of the situation. Certainly nothing compared to what we saw with George W. Bush after 9/11. Bret: Not a perfect comparison. You can fault George W. Bush in any number of ways, but he did not spend the months before 9/11 repeatedly telling the public that there was absolutely no threat of a terrorist attack on our soil or boasting that he had it all under control, or claiming Osama bin Laden was a liberal hoax to delegitimize his presidency and wreck the economy. Bret: The inability of so much of the public to remember what Trump was saying just a month ago suggests that, in addition to the coronavirus crisis, we're also experiencing a national amnesia pandemic. Gail: Maybe it's just national attention deficit disorder. People do hit a point where they just can't cope with coronavirus discussions 24-7.

Hey, maybe as a public service we should briefly change the subject. Have you heard there's a race for the Democratic presidential nomination? Bret: Could we have a do-over? Watching Andrew Cuomo's press conferences in recent weeks, I find myself fantasizing about the New York governor becoming the party's nominee. Your thoughts? Gail: Cuomo has an, um, forceful personality. Perfect for the present moment, when he can represent the frightened, beleaguered public. Joe Biden got to be the likely Democratic presidential nominee with the exact opposite aura -- the candidate who didn't drive a large chunk of the voting public nuts. Bret: Fair point, and if the pandemic is behind us by Election Day, maybe Cuomo's style won't wear as well, just as Rudy Giuliani's wore thin a few years after 9/11. But for the time being, Cuomo is playing the part of the president we wish we had -- compassionate, well-informed, firm, but also flexibly responding to changing conditions -- as opposed to the irascible, ignorant and self-infatuated president we do have. Gail: No question Cuomo's the hero in that pairing. And you could certainly sell tickets to the debate. Bret: Biden is like the guy in the audience raising his hand and hoping the moderator calls on him. I fear this is an inauspicious beginning for the general election. Gail: I'm not going to argue that Biden has been a stirring presence. But I was listening to him on TV the other night, and he was pretty clear in what he thought should be happening, policy-wise.

The moments when he really makes contact, though, are the personal ones -- talking about having get-togethers with his grandkids where Biden and his wife sit on the porch while the kids sit a distance away on the lawn. Hard to imagine Donald Trump sitting still for that. And of course Biden relates so intensely to what the country's going through because of his own history of family tragedies. Bret: Those of us in lockdown nation definitely could use an empathizer-in-chief. I just went back and looked at the clip of Biden's interview on CNN, when he spoke about his own extensive experience of tragedy and grief. It was moving and real, the candidate at his best. Gail: This is not the moment to have a leader whose most stirring emotional experience was firing people on reality TV. Bret: But here's my fear: the Biden campaign reminds me a bit of John McCain's 2008 campaign -- minus the Sarah Palin part, of course. McCain started off as the presumptive front-runner, then nearly ran out of gas before making a miraculous primary comeback. But then his campaign sorta just flatlined. In the meantime, he ran as the candidate of character and personal biography, not energy, ideas, and hope. And he got crushed as the country went through the crucible of the 2008 financial crisis. Gail: I was covering McCain when he crashed and burned. Once the national focus switched over to the economic crisis, he was just sort of lost. He and Barack Obama were at a big bipartisan meeting on what to do next, and McCain didn't seem to have a clue. Biden's not like that. He isn't a personality-personal-history candidate; he's a former-vice-president-who-knows-how-the-system-works candidate.

Bret: If Biden is going to make himself more relevant to the moment, I think he needs to do more than emphasize his command of bureaucracy or his experience of personal tragedy. He's going to need to reintroduce voters to the ""Scranton Joe"" side of his biography. One reason I suspect Trump is benefiting politically from the pandemic is that he's been talking about minimizing the economic fallout and getting the country back to work. That might be irresponsible from a medical and epidemiological point of view. But it resonates with millions of Americans, especially small business owners and their employees faced with complete financial ruin if the shutdowns carry on for months. Biden needs to compete for those voters, particularly those in must-win states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. Gail: How are you feeling about the shutdowns? As it stands now, it's easy to imagine them going on for months. Even if New York does hit its peak in April, as the experts are now predicting, it'll be summer before we're really back to normalcy. And even then the virus will probably be wreaking havoc in other parts of the country where the contagion started later. Bret: I'm not averse to the kinds of shutdowns that have been imposed so far, especially in dense urban areas where the risk of mass contagion is so high. I'm not averse to extending them by another three weeks, either, as Trump did over the weekend. We've got an urgent health crisis and critical shortages of essential medical equipment, particularly ventilators, so buying some time makes sense. On the other hand, the idea of a much longer nationwide shutdown strikes me as no less dangerous, potentially more so. The economic damage would be monumental, beyond anything in the power of the government to fix. It runs the risk of creating a secondary health crisis in terms of depression, isolation, suicide, addiction and so on. And even then the virus is going to continue to run its course until we've found a vaccine or at least more effective medication. Gail: You know I'm going to ask you what the alternative is. Bret: I'm intrigued by countries like Holland and Sweden, which are pursuing a mitigation strategy instead of a suppression strategy. Obviously the jury is still out on what sort of outcomes they'll have, and perhaps they'll be terrible. But given that this is a pandemic whose consequences are going to be so far-reaching, I think there ought to be room for a certain amount of variety and intelligent experimentation in terms of response. Then again, I'm not often in the habit of advocating the Swedish model! Gail: Having lived through decades of fruitless arguments about why we should emulate Sweden, I'm just going to shrug and cede the point. But go on.

Bret: Can we encourage habits of social distancing without enforcing total lockdowns? Can we have restaurants open but cut their seating capacity by 60 or 70 percent, so customers aren't so close? Can we focus our efforts on protecting the most vulnerable part of the population, especially the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, while accepting a heightened level of risk for others? Gail: God, the idea of going out with friends to a restaurant sounds like a kind of Shangri-La. But it also scares the heck out of me. Maybe I've been brainwashed over the last couple of weeks, but given the incredible stress on our hospitals right now, the idea of just taking the risk to see what happens is ... unnerving. Bret: I don't know. As my very wise mom never tires of reminding me, I don't have a degree in medicine or public health. Gail: Loved that column about your mother, by the way. Bret: Thanks! She liked it too and only wishes I would agree with her more often. (As in: always.) But I was struck by a quote from John F.

Fashion & Style,Calvin Klein's Style Sharknado,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/12/fashion/calvin-klein-jaws-oscar-de-la-renta-new-york-fashion-week.html,"There was blood on the floor at Calvin Klein. Or, to be accurate, a blood-red carpet on the floor of Calvin Klein 205W39NYC, which is the painfully long official name of the collection that determines the direction of the brand. On the walls, screens displayed a video of crystalline water sparkling in the sunshine. A swimmer hove languidly into view. Then John Williams's classic two-note thrum -- the one now recognized around the world as the harbinger of scary things to come, the one that increasingly seems like the soundtrack of life -- filled the air. ""Jaws"" had entered the fashion week. Well, we all know we're teetering on the edge of something. ""Fear"" is the best seller of the day. We might as well dress for it.

Since being named the house's chief creative officer in 2016, Raf Simons has made something of a signature of exploring the dark side of the American pop landscape: car-crash road trips, post-apocalyptic prairies. This time around his setting was the beach, and his topic the moment of lip-biting anticipation: the seconds before the shark actually appears, when you know it is coming and things will either all work out -- it will miss the girl, she will swim on in the sunshine, the threat will pass by until another time -- or go horribly wrong.

It's a moment, like this moment, where the future is not yet decided. We know how it ended that time. The question is: What about this time? Mr. Simons, who called ""Jaws"" a ""masterpiece"" in post-show interviews after being swarmed by his celebrity guests as if they were sea gulls going after a crust of bread, didn't have an answer. But he did have some pretty great ideas about what we might wear while we waited, gnawing our fingernails, to find out. It began with the wet suit, protective and kind of kinky at the same time, spliced and re-engineered with wardrobe classics in the Anne Bancroft vein -- relics from an era that believed in a different sort of ending. Miniskirts dangling with what looked like garter belts turned out to be inverted scuba su it tops (often worn with tanks splashed with the ""Jaws"" promo picture), washed with Impressionist florals or cafe-society leopard print, which were also used as aprons/cummerbunds that wrapped the hips of both men and women. It was as if a surfer had just emerged from the waves, begun to peel away his or her top to dry off, and then decided it was actually a really great accessory.

Swingy pleated skirts had a giant bite taken out of them over one thigh. Midcentury sleeveless martini-shift dresses were made from crushed rosettes of taffeta caught up at the hip or shoulder with rhinestone circle pins and finished with a big bow at the top and a gear harness draped like a cape on the shoulders. There were oversize tweed blazers and chunky fisherman knits (for both men and women) and baby blue tuxedo jackets and skinny lounge-lizard pants (for men). There were some tighty whiteys.

Graduation is, after all, another time of looming possibility. The connections made an unexpected amount of sense. It was hard not to smile. That clothes can make you do that when the subject is dread is part of the point. As is the fact that the designer at the helm of a brand like Calvin Klein might appreciate the value of a commercial blockbuster and how it meshes with more artistic aspirations. In any case, Mr. Simons wasn't the only designer wrestling with dystopian visions and the once and future dreams of his adopted country. At Coach 1941, Stuart Vevers took his prairie girls and boys on the road to a dust-ridden desert after the fall. Under the rusted metal bones of a dinosaur skeleton form came floor-sweeping nightie gowns and ruffled shirts, fringed suedes and distressed leathers, big sweatshirts and lace-trimmed slip dresses, like ghosts of a Laura Ingalls Wilder past.","How to dress for the age of ""Fear,"" courtesy of Raf Simons.

Opinion,José Andrés: We Have a Food Crisis Unfolding Out of Sight,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/opinion/restaurants-coronavirus-food-aid.html,"Writing in the middle of two devastating cholera pandemics in the early 1800s, the great French culinary thinker Brillat-Savarin articulated a truth we urgently need to grasp today: ""The destiny of nations depends on how they feed themselves."" The coronavirus pandemic threatens to create both a public health and economic catastrophe. But we cannot afford to ignore the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding out of sight. Our fate as a nation depends on how we feed our most vulnerable citizens through this crisis. If our leaders step up now with federal aid, food can be the solution -- supporting millions of jobs while also feeding millions of people in desperate need. There is historical precedent for spending federal dollars to preserve jobs and serve the public: the Works Progress Administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal. Over eight years, the W.P.A. put more than eight million Americans to work, building schools, hospitals and vital infrastructure. Today we need a W.P.A. to feed America. In honor of one of its food programs, I suggest calling this new emergency relief America Eats Now.

We combined a private-sector mentality with federal dollars and private donations to pump cash through the food supply chain, putting people to work by feeding those in the greatest need. We activated a large-scale kitchen at an arena and smaller kitchens in restaurants and schools, serving millions of meals at a time when everything seemed paralyzed. In Puerto Rico we used three clear approaches to feed our fellow Americans that can be a guide to heading off an economic and food crisis today: -- Support the private sector as quickly as possible when the economy crashes, as it did after Maria: activate kitchens with federal dollars to serve the people. -- Repurpose and deploy community facilities, while expanding their mission: use the kitchens in schools and arenas to feed more people, more quickly. -- Solve the informational and logistical challenge: Matching demand and supply -- by getting food to the people who need it most -- is even more challenging than cooking in a crisis. Distribution is the Achilles' heel of any disaster response.

Since then we have adapted our model to feeding first responders in the California wildfires, as well as stricken communities after natural disasters in the Caribbean and Mozambique. This week I have re-opened several of my own shuttered restaurants as community kitchens, serving meals at low or no cost to people in need. But these are only models for what we should do now; they are too small to meet the unprecedented challenges we face as a nation. We need to understand that these crises threaten our national security. Today an army of American cooks stands ready to serve our most vulnerable citizens, at a time when those cooks are themselves in desperate need of support. They are our food first responders. With the full support of the federal government, they can serve the many, while saving so many jobs. There are three groups in our communities who face the greatest threat from the pandemic: the elderly, the homeless and families struggling to make ends meet. As we know from public health officials, the elderly face the greatest risk of infection and mortality. We know that many of them are afraid for their lives in doing something as routine as going to the supermarket. Isolation may be the best option for avoiding the pandemic, but our parents and grandparents still need to eat to be healthy in body and soul. The plight of Italy's elderly is an unspeakable tragedy that we should avoid at all costs. Now is the time to stand up the private sector -- our neighborhood restaurants -- to sustain the lives of our elderly neighbors.

Congress is currently contemplating a $54 billion request to support our airlines. I respectfully request that at least a similar amount be dedicated to America Eats Now, so that our restaurants and delivery partners can feed our elderly citizens and deliver meals to their doorsteps. That measure of spending could sustain our elderly citizens in daily meals, freshly prepared, through the peak of this crisis. It would also sustain our farm workers, food suppliers and delivery agents, who in turn would spend the cash sustaining their own families. There are many hundreds of thousands of food jobs that depend on our restaurants. America's technological innovators, such as Uber and GrubHub, can rapidly adapt a home delivery service for our neighbors who are too fearful to buy their own food. This country's world-class entrepreneurs can solve these challenges creatively and economically. The second group that needs our urgent support are families on the brink of economic disaster. Governors and mayors across the country have rightly grappled with the competing needs to close down schools to limit the spread of the virus, while maintaining the school meal services that keep our kids healthy. We need to go several steps further, however. The children who rely on free school meals live in families who are struggling financially at the best of times. Now is the time to extend the school meal program to their families: to turn our school kitchens into community kitchens. For those in suburban and rural areas, we should use the school bus network to deliver food packages along the routes where they normally pick up and drop off students. Sadly, school kitchens may not be enough. As the crisis worsens, we need to maintain the capacity to support our medical heroes, first responders, senior centers and the homeless, with safe havens of food preparation and distribution. Hospital kitchens and senior centers will lose staff to sickness. An army marches on its stomach: Our police and National Guard can no longer rely on their favorite neighborhood food stands and delis.

Now is the time to prepare our arenas and convention centers -- all subsidized by taxpayer dollars, even when owned and operated by private entities -- to meet the food needs of this public health catastrophe. Trained to the highest standards of food hygiene, with strict protocols to ensure that infection is not spread through food, our arena chefs should be the last resort for safe cooking for our frontline workers in this war. The National Restaurant Association is advocating for a much larger package of support, worth more than $300 billion, as it seeks to save up to seven million jobs through a mixture of grants, loans and deferments. Our restaurant industry faces an existential challenge that we all recognize. It is one of the foundational sectors in our economy: four times bigger than our airline industry in sales, and 18 times bigger in jobs. Every industry group should make its case in this crisis. But only those of us who work in restaurants can help revive the economy while feeding and building our communities at the same time. Restaurants were shut down by our governments; they can be revived by our governments to serve the people in their hour of greatest need. These challenges can seem overwhelming, but we believe the most effective solutions are often right in front of us. Our small nonprofit has safely prepared and served food in cholera-stricken Mozambique by being meticulous about our daily work. That cholera experience equipped us with the sanitation protocols to feed the virus-infected cruise ships in Japan and California. In every disaster zone where we cook for the many, we find that a plate of food is never just a meal on a dish. It is a plate of hope: a message from the community that someone, somewhere cares. Now is the time for Congress and the Trump administration to show they care. Together we can ensure that America Eats Now.

Music,A Natural Fit of Music and Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/arts/music/orchestras-art-museums-collaboration.html,"Collaborations between United States museums and orchestras date to at least 1923, when the Cleveland Orchestra premiered a suite by Douglas Moore inspired by four works in the Cleveland Museum of Art's collection. But the partnerships are growing today among institutions of all sizes, as museums and orchestras seek new audiences. In June, for example, Jazz at Lincoln Center performed a series of concerts called ""Portraits of America: A Jazz Story."" A dozen members of the orchestra composed new pieces of music inspired by the works of such artists as Romare Bearden and Stuart Davis in the collection of the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville, Ark. Accompanying the musical performances in Jazz at Lincoln Center's Frederick P. Rose Hall was a digital presentation highlighting each work that inspired a composition. The museum also held a watch party of a live-streamed performance at its home in Arkansas .

Some collaborations in the upcoming museum and orchestral seasons will mark important anniversaries, local in one case, national in the other. As Rebecca Salminen Witt, chief development and communications officer of the Detroit Historical Society, pointed out, ""significant anniversaries are good markers for what history bears as important, what the public can connect to."" The Detroit Historical Society and Detroit Symphony Orchestra are jointly celebrating the centennial of the city's Orchestra Hall, which was designed by the theater architect C. Howard Crane and opened in 1919 . Although it served as the home of the orchestra until 1939, from 1941 to 1951 it was renamed the Paradis e Theatre and was a jazz concert hall; it then fell into disrepair before being saved in 1970 and restored, becoming the symphony's home again in 1989 .

To celebrate the hall's 100th anniversary, the society lent a 1920 Dodge Model 30 car, owned by the former symphony vice president Horace Dodge, to the orchestra, which is displaying it for a month in the atrium of the Max M. and Marjorie S. Fisher Music Center , a recent addition to the hall. The society also is creating special exhibitions of music-related memorabilia, including jazz-related items, that will be on display in the center through March, as well as at the Detroit Historical Museum early next year.

The New York Philharmonic is staging an elaborate multiyear initiative starting in February called ""Project 19"" to mark the centennial of the ratification of the 19th Amendment to the United States Constitution. A key offering will be a newly staged version of Virgil Thomson's 1947 opera, with libretto by Gertrude Stein, ""The Mother of Us All,"" which tells the story of Susan B. Anthony, an early suffragist who died before the amendment giving women the right to vote was ratified. Other historical figures involved with the movement -- ranging from Daniel Webster to Lillian Russell -- are also portrayed. The production will be jointly presented by the orchestra, Juilliard School and Metropolitan Museum of Art in the museum's Charles Engelhard Court, in its American wing.

Limor Tomer, general manager of the museum's live arts program, said the museum and orchestra ""are on the same page programmatically. We share a commitment to diversifying audiences for contemporary works by living artists."" Another goal of this collaboration, added Deborah Borda, president and chief executive of the New York Philharmonic, is to attract younger audiences, who she hopes will find the opera ""absolutely riveting in terms applicable to today."" A similar collaboration will take place next spring in Cleveland, when the Cleveland Museum of Art and Cleveland Orchestra, along with the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage, Cleveland Institute of Art Cinematheque, Cleveland School of the Arts, Cleveland Public Library and Facing History and Ourselves, an educational nonprofit, will participate in a citywide festival called ""Censored: Art & Power.""

The centerpiece of the festival will be three performances in May by the orchestra of the 1935 opera ""Lulu,"" written by the Austrian composer Alban Berg during the Nazis' rise to power. Also featuring a program in the museum's German Expressionist gallery about works made by artists considered ""degenerate"" by the Nazis, a display of books on this art in the museum's library, and related concerts and lectures, the festival will ""look at the relationship of art and politics in Berg's lifetime,"" said Franz Welser-Most, the orchestra's music director. ""Just as the character of Lulu is abused and abusive in her own way, we will look into how music and art can be abused by a system and how a system can turn people on one another. These are important topics, not only from the past but in today's world,"" Mr. Welser-Most said. The St. Louis Symphony Orchestra, whose musicians have been performing contemporary chamber music in the Tadao Ando-designed Pulitzer Arts Foundatio n since 2004, will continue this tradition in the current season. In January, as part of the museum's Susan Philipsz ' ""Seven Tears"" exhibition, the orchestra will perform the world premiere of the live version of her ""Study for Strings."" It is inspired by a 1943 composition of the same name written in the Theresienstadt concentration camp by Czech composer Pavel Haas and performed in a 1944 Nazi propaganda film about the camp; Haas was killed in Auschwitz in 1944.

Not all collaborations between museums and orchestras involve huge institutions. From January through May next year, the Museum of Fine Arts in St. Petersburg, Fla., will display over 100 set designs and original costumes from the Tobin Collection of Theatre Arts in a traveling exhibition developed by the McNay Art Museum in San Antonio. It will also offer live performances of classical music, opera, dance, theater and poetry, working with the local Florida Orchestra and Detroit-based orchestra Sphinx Virtuosi . Many performances will take place on a custom-built stage in the exhibition's galleries. And the Omaha Symphony will continue its ongoing collaboration with the Joslyn Art Museum, presenting concerts whose programs are inspired by works in the museum's collection. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice will perform the second movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 at a concert in May; its program is inspired by a Frank Stella mixed-media painting, ""Nogaro,"" named after an automotive racetrack in France.","Orchestras and museums are stepping up their partnerships, hoping to attract new audiences both young and old.",acaa0658-9fcc-5b28-bd86-ae8a1265df41,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/27/multimedia/27sp-orchestras1/27sp-orchestras1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=f1e0d792827519859acf1913c84c5fe8a54bf54b790f03279b7df727e66cab30&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The June 2019 performance of ""Portraits of America: A Jazz Story"" featuring the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra with Wynton Marsalis, performing to Romare Bearden's ""Sacrifice,"" 1941.",acaa0658-9fcc-5b28-bd86-ae8a1265df41,N24News/imgs/acaa0658-9fcc-5b28-bd86-ae8a1265df41.jpg,12
Food,"On His Own, the Burgundy Iconoclast Laurent Ponsot Looks to Big Projects",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/dining/drinks/laurent-ponsot-burgundy-wine-domaine-ponsot.html,"On His Own, the Burgundy Iconoclast Laurent Ponsot Looks to Big Projects

Over the last few decades, Domaine Ponsot has earned a reputation as one of the most unusual, iconoclastic estates in Burgundy. Led by Laurent Ponsot, who very much follows his own muse, the estate, based in Morey-St.-Denis, produced wines of depth, purity and great beauty that were highly coveted and very expensive. But the wines were also occasionally criticized as inconsistent, a problem sometimes attributed to Mr. Ponsot's aversion to sulfur dioxide, a stabilizer used almost universally in wine production. Mr. Ponsot also came to be known for his role in exposing a multimillion-dollar counterfeit wine scheme, in which he brought fraudulent bottles to the attention of the authorities and testified against Rudy Kurniawan, a well-known wine dealer who was sentenced in 2014 to 10 years in prison. So Burgundy fans were shocked when Mr. Ponsot announced in February 2017 that he was leaving the family estate, effective immediately. He offered no explanation other than that it was for personal reasons.

Since then, Mr. Ponsot has stayed ""silent and hidden,"" as he put it in a recent interview in New York, when for the first time since his departure he spoke about his plans. In typical Ponsot fashion, he is going his own way. First, Mr. Ponsot said, he will be making wine, both from grapes he purchases as a negociant and from vineyards that he owns. And he will be working with his son, Clement. ""I was born above a cellar in Morey-St.-Denis and grew up among barrels and vats, working with my father,"" he said. ""I think I have some blood in my wine, not wine in my blood."" Mr. Ponsot, 63, lean and voluble with salt-and-pepper hair that once hung past his shoulders but is now trimmed neatly, said his new label would simply be ""Laurent Ponsot,"" which he said represented not an estate or a house, but simply an ""entity."" The name was selected not out of vanity, he said, but as an assumption of responsibility for what is in the bottle. Domaine Ponsot was best known for its grand cru Burgundies, in particular its Clos de la Roche, a vineyard named for the rockiness of its limestone soils -- a character expressed, as the French wine writer Jacky Rigaux once put it, ""to the chagrin of pickaxes and ploughs but to the delight of the roots that can penetrate into the depths of the parent rock.""

""When I left Domaine Ponsot,"" he said, ""I traveled and asked people in the trade, 'I'm starting from zero; what do you want me to produce?' They said, 'Bourgogne rouge et blanc, and then villages.'"" These are the lower levels of the Burgundy hierarchy, in which vineyard areas are ranked on their potential to produce distinctive wines. Regional wines like Bourgogne Rouge or Bourgogne Blanc are made of pinot noir or chardonnay, just like their grander counterparts. But while they may be delicious, they theoretically offer no distinct sense of place beyond a general Burgundy character. Above these are village wines, which may express the personality of places like Meursault, Gevrey-Chambertin or Chambolle-Musigny, all of which Mr. Ponsot will produce. Still more distinctive are premier cru wines, from particular vineyards within villages that have the potential to produce better wines, and, at the top, the grand crus, which receive no village designation because the vineyards themselves are so singular. As Burgundy has gained popularity around the world in recent decades, these grand cru wines, made in minute quantities, have become exorbitantly expensive, leading in part to counterfeiting, as in the Kurniawan case. ""You have people pricing these wines at insane levels,"" Mr. Ponsot said. ""Seventy percent of grand cru is drunk by people who know nothing about wine. This makes the pricing crazy.""

At such prices, he said, bottles from the most esteemed estates like Domaine de la Romanee-Conti become status symbols or investments that are rarely enjoyed for their intrinsic beauty. ""I want to produce wines that people can open and enjoy,"" Mr. Ponsot said. ""Not one in two bottles of D.R.C. is ever opened."" If the current situation makes Mr. Ponsot angry, it is primarily because he passionately loves Burgundy and its defining notion of terroir: that the best wines can express the qualities of where the grapes were grown and the culture of the people who made them. He hates to see a distortion of what it represents. ""No place on earth is like Burgundy,"" he said. ""It's 70 kilometers long, one kilometer wide, and it has 1,200 appellations. My whole life I have been believing in terroir."" This faith in terroir, and a desire that people understand it better, has led Mr. Ponsot to his most ambitious, and perhaps most outlandish, idea for the future. He wants to build a visitor center, to be called Villa Vinum, set on five acres among the vines of the Cote de Nuits, not far from the Clos de Vougeot. The multilevel center will use virtual reality, interactive screens, films, performances, conferences and a library, with the purpose of educating people about the wines, vineyards and terroir of Burgundy.

He emphasized that Villa Vinum would not be a museum. Rather, he said, it would be focused on the future. The project, he estimated, would cost 20 million euros. He said he hoped to break ground in 2020 or 2021. While he is committed to his vision, he said he also found it a bit daunting. ""You have to be a little naive, otherwise you do nothing,"" he said. ""I am scared of this, but it activates my blood."" Mr. Ponsot has never taken the easy way. While he knew early on that he wanted to work in the vines, he said he would not have felt challenged had he never left Burgundy. Instead, he said, he hid his early passion for wine and left to see the world. Eventually, he opened a travel agency in Paris, married and had three children. Only in his early 30s did he decide to return to the family domaine. He still will not elaborate on why he left it last year. Domaine Ponsot is now run by his sister Rose-Marie. His aim at Laurent Ponsot, he said, is to make ""haute couture"" wines. ""I want to work on each element, from planting the vine to presentation of the wine on the table,"" he said. ""If I don't grow the grapes, the grapes I buy must be perfect, in my opinion. Every detail is important."" In his winemaking, as in his new visitor center, Mr. Ponsot combines a reverence for history with an appreciation of what technology can offer. He farms without chemicals, but refuses to adhere to any sort of agricultural ideology, which he describes as restrictive. He avoids sulfur dioxide, but protects the wine in vats with layers of neutral gas.

Stung by fraud, he says his bottles will be equipped with microchips to assure their provenance. And cases will carry temperature sensors so that customers can be sure they have not been mishandled in transportation. Mr. Ponsot has always avoided the use of new oak barrels because he dislikes the oaky flavor that they can impart, but he has continued to use older barrels because they permit the slow oxygenation of the wine as it rests in the winery. Now, he said, he has begun an experiment testing an alternative to barrel aging that will also permit this slow exposure to oxygen. ""It took me 20 years to get the perfect cork,"" he said, ""but I hope it will take less time in this new study."" The aim, he said, is wine that does not show off, and that is alive and has the ability to communicate. ""I don't want to please critics. I want to please myself,"" he said. ""When I open a bottle, I want to have an emotion. If I don't have the emotion I won't put it on the market."" Ultimately, he hopes, he will be able to produce from 500 to 600 barrels of wine a year, which is about four times the production of Domaine Ponsot. ""I am an optimistic guy,"" he said. ""I will end my life with goals, work and faith."" Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

Sports,"Willie Wood, Star Defensive Back With the Green Bay Packers, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/sports/willie-wood-death.html,"Willie Wood, who was overlooked in the N.F.L. draft but forged a Hall of Fame career as one of pro football's greatest defensive backs, playing on five Green Bay Packers championship teams of the 1960s, died on Monday in Washington. He was 83.

His death, at an assisted living facility, was announced by the Packers.

Wood was found to have dementia in 2006 and had received financial assistance from a joint N.F.L.-players' union fund aiding former players with that condition. He had also undergone several orthopedic operations. In March 2012, when his native Washington named a block of N Street, where he had once lived, as ""Willie Wood Way,"" he attended the ceremony in a wheelchair.

Playing for the Packers from 1960 to 1971, Wood did not have much speed and was only 5 feet 10 inches tall and 180 pounds at best. But he was an outstanding tackler, often hitting opponents around the ankles when he was not intercepting passes or batting them down.

Sports,N.F.L.'s Big Running Back Deals Will Lead to Sour Grapes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/sports/football/alvin-kamara-dalvin-cook-contract.html,"No one really denies that Cook, Kamara and the others are useful players who help their teams win. But the college ranks produce dozens of burly, speedy, determined and affordable rushers in every draft class, while the rigors of plunging into the teeth of N.F.L. defenses quickly wear down all but the rarest backs.

The difference in marginal value between a 26-year-old All-Pro with 1,000 professional carries on his odometer and the typical midround rookie doesn't come close to the costs: roughly $12 million per year for the veteran, less than $2 million for the rookie.

Furthermore, the rookie is more likely to produce positive results. Of the 15 running backs who rushed for over 1,000 rushing yards last season, 12 of them were on their original rookie contracts and 13 of them were 25 or younger. Ezekiel Elliott of the Dallas Cowboys was last season's only 1,000-yard rusher who was playing on a contract extension for the team that had drafted him. Thanks to his $90 million eruption of generosity toward Elliott, the Cowboys' owner, Jerry Jones, is currently searching for loose change in the cushions of his salary-cap sofa so he can afford to pay quarterback Dak Prescott.

Last weekend's action was full of examples of the folly of overpaying running backs. Cook rushed for 50 yards and two touchdowns on 12 carries, while his minimum-wage backup, Alexander Mattison, rushed for an identical 50 yards on six carries. Malcolm Brown, Gurley's low-cost replacement for the Rams, rushed for 79 yards and two touchdowns, while Gurley gained 56 yards and had one touchdown for the Falcons.

The Jacksonville Jaguars released Leonard Fournette rather than pay him Cook-Kamara money in late August; he rushed five times for 5 yards for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on Sunday, while the undrafted Illinois State rookie James Robinson gained 90 yards from scrimmage in Fournette's place in a Jaguars victory.

General managers and coaches know that running backs rarely pay dividends on lucrative contracts. Yet they continue to convince themselves that each situation is an exception. Kamara is a key piece of the Saints' Super Bowl puzzle, so why not risk mortgaging the future? (Ask the Rams about Gurley.) McCaffrey and Kamara are versatile rushers and receivers, so they will age more gracefully! (So is/was Bell.) As for Cook, well, the Vikings simply enjoy paying retail for name brands.

Some teams also just want to reward successful employees like Kamara and Cook for their hard work. That's a laudable policy in a league that rarely does anything laudable. Young running backs sell jerseys, spur the fantasy industry, provide thrills and inspire dreams; it's hard to criticize their big paydays without sounding like a grouchy, myopic bean counter.","The Saints and the Vikings became the latest teams to invest in the run, signing Alvin Kamara and Dalvin Cook to five-year deals.

How would a person act if he or she had been raised outside of society? The question has been considered in works like the Austrian playwright Peter Handke's drama ""Kaspar,"" about a 19th-century German who claimed to have grown up without any human contact, and ""Captain Fantastic,"" the 2016 feature that cast Viggo Mortensen as a father who lived with his children in the woods. But ""Hanna,"" a 2011 thriller, asked it with a fresh angle: what if someone were raised outside of society -- to be a meticulous killer? The movie cast Saoirse Ronan in the role of Hanna, a teenager whose father trained her in the wilderness to be an assassin. This new adaptation, created and written by David Farr (a writer of the original movie), puts a new spin on the tale, with Hanna (now played by Esme Creed-Miles) hunting and being hunted by a C.I.A. agent (Mireille Enos).

Haywood is a soft-spoken racer who rose to fame in the 1970s, after he won the two best-known 24-hour races, Daytona and Le Mans, in the same year. But the documentary focuses on another fact about him: Throughout his career, he had hid his sexuality.

Science,How Musk Oxen Make It Through Arctic Nights and Never-Ending Days,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/28/science/musk-ox-circadian-rhythm.html,"In the distant reaches of northeastern Greenland, musk oxen amble across the tundra, grazing as they go. As Arctic creatures, they need to gather enough energy to make it through cold, dark winters. So when the bright summers come, they eat as if their lives depend on it -- as in fact they do.

Their lives are so extreme, scientists have wondered: Do they have circadian clocks?

Most creatures on the planet live in lock step with the planet's daily cycle of light and dark. There's a time of day for eating, a time of day for sleeping, a time for digestion and so on. Scientists think 24-hour internal clocks help maximize an organism's survival by keeping it from, for instance, wasting energy foraging at times of day when food may be hard to find. Evolution clearly favored this approach -- circadian clocks exist in almost every life form.

However, the long night of Arctic winter and the endless day of its summer are very different from conditions in the rest of the planet. And researchers report in a paper published Wednesday in Royal Society Open Science that musk ox behavior does not seem to follow a daily pattern year-round. The most prominent cycles in their behavior are instead those of alternating grazing and digesting, which repeat every few hours, and sometimes are abandoned when the sun doesn't set in the summer.

The researchers used GPS collars to track 19 free-roaming musk oxen for up to three years, said Floris van Beest, an Arctic ecologist at Aarhus University in Denmark and an author of the new paper. By keeping track of the animals' movements, they could tell whether they were eating, resting or moving from one area to another over longer distances. They then checked to see whether there were patterns in any of these behaviors -- whether they repeated and if they did, how frequently.",Scientists wondered whether animals living above the Arctic Circle had the same circadian rhythms as the rest of us.,d3cbf546-5143-5b89-b86e-5aa7ec305650,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/10/science/28TB-MUSKOX/28TB-MUSKOX-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8accdca46ea92929d36de714de3c2352b1f4d2b4c601b50984bcc81a5c74ca71&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Musk ox bulls sparring near Kangerlussuaq, Greenland.",d3cbf546-5143-5b89-b86e-5aa7ec305650,N24News/imgs/d3cbf546-5143-5b89-b86e-5aa7ec305650.jpg,2
Technology,How a Top Antitrust Official Helped T-Mobile and Sprint Merge,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/technology/sprint-t-mobile-merger-antitrust-official.html,"WASHINGTON -- As the $26 billion blockbuster merger between T-Mobile and Sprint teetered this summer, Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, labored to rescue it behind the scenes, according to text messages revealed this week in a lawsuit to block the deal. Mr. Delrahim connected company executives with the F.C.C. and members of Congress. And he gave executives insight into the thinking of Ajit Pai, the chairman of the F.C.C. who would also have to approve the merger. He is ""open and willing"" to discussions about the deal, Mr. Delrahim said in one text message in June, a month before regulators blessed the transaction. The messages between Mr. Delrahim and the executives involved in structuring one of the telecom industry's most significant mergers in generations provide a rare inside look at the hands-on work the Justice Department's top antitrust official undertook to shape the deal.

While it is not unusual for a law enforcement official to work behind the scenes to help companies overcome antitrust concerns, efforts like the one undertaken by Mr. Delrahim are almost always hidden from view. The text messages show that he played a crucial role in bringing together top executives of T-Mobile, Sprint and another company, Dish, for negotiations. The Justice Department has said it would not have approved the merger without the emergence of another competitor like Dish. The Obama administration rejected an earlier proposed merger between the companies, and it remains deeply unpopular with some consumer groups who fear it will increase prices for Americans, especially in rural areas. Mr. Delrahim oversaw the often hostile talks between the companies, while pulling strings to get lawmakers and other regulators on board. ""Had a generally good chat with the chairman,"" Mr. Delrahim wrote to Charles Ergen, the chief executive of Dish, the company that would prove crucial to the deal's passage. The following day he encouraged Mr. Ergen to lobby lawmakers to urge Mr. Pai to approve new deal terms that would give Mr. Ergen more time to build out a competitive telecom business.

Mr. Ergen did so. He told Mr. Delrahim that he had ""very good"" meetings in Washington and that he talked to Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, about the deal, according to the text messages. When asked about the text messages, a Justice Department spokesman said that ""the Antitrust Division is proud of its work in reviewing this important merger on behalf of the American consumer,"" but declined to comment further. T-Mobile and Dish declined to comment on the messages, which were submitted as evidence in a legal challenge to the merger led by the New York and California state attorneys general. Sprint didn't immediately respond to requests for comment. The messages also show that SoftBank, the Japanese conglomerate that owns the majority of Sprint, discussed lending Dish money to buy the assets it needed to become a telecom company.

In such an arrangement, SoftBank would essentially be financing a competitor to its own company, Sprint. But SoftBank also stood to lose financially if a Sprint-T-Mobile merger did not happen. In one strained exchange, Mr. Ergen told John Legere, the chief executive of T-Mobile, that he was still working to get terms of a deal done, pending board approval and ""any other issues from our/your team.""

""And waiting on Softbank to finance the deal?"" Mr. Legere wrote. Mr. Ergen said publicly this week that several potential lenders had emerged to help his company buy assets, including JPMorgan Chase and SoftBank. Sprint and T-Mobile, the third- and fourth-largest wireless companies, announced their latest merger plans in April 2018. The carriers promised their union would allow them to combine resources and bring the next generation of wireless broadband, known as 5G, for fifth generation, to rural America. They would have a combined 80 million United States subscribers. The Justice Department announced its approval of the deal in July, citing the creation of a fourth and new competitor in Dish, which would buy assets from Sprint and T-Mobile to become a telecom company. In a parallel review, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission announced it planned to approve the deal weeks later. The merger is being challenged in court by several states and cannot close until that lawsuit is resolved. State attorneys general in New York and California are unconvinced that Dish will provide true market competition. ""Dish is a struggling satellite TV firm with no experience running a mobile wireless business -- and no current mobile wireless business,"" Paula Blizzard, California's deputy attorney general, said on a call with journalists this month. ""We cannot count on Dish one day in the future somehow growing into a viable wireless company equal to Sprint's reach today."" Mr. Delrahim was pressured to block the merger throughout the department's review. Several Democratic lawmakers, consumer groups and state attorneys general said the deal would harm consumers by reducing the number of national wireless carriers to three from four. The reduction in competition would most likely lead to higher consumer wireless bills, the critics warned. To salvage the deal, the companies came up with a solution: bring in Dish Network to buy some of their wireless assets to form another competitor and maintain four national mobile carriers.

""You've crossed the line,"" he wrote. ""For full disclosure (which may be a new term to you) I have told Makan I don't believe you are serious about doing a deal."" Mr. Delrahim seemed aware of the friction. In one set of messages, he invited Mr. Ergen to a meeting the next day with Mr. Legere and Mike Sievert, the president of T-Mobile, in his conference room at the Justice Department. ""2pm confirmed,"" Mr. Delrahim wrote. ""I have not told John and Mike the meeting is w you yet, I will tell them in the AM."" But the day the meeting was scheduled, Mr. Delrahim gave Mr. Ergen an update about a long talk he had held with Mr. Legere, Mr. Sievert and Mr. Claure. ""John is going to reach out to you,"" Mr. Delrahim wrote. ""May make good sense for you all to meet alone at 2, and then we all meet later today? I will make myself available.""","Text messages indicate that Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, worked behind the scenes to help the companies pull off a deal.",51ba945e-af84-5185-a822-35370cd1354a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/19/business/19antitrust/19antitrust-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=6b40f5662fb9b59bda34f1c480ece64c355eb09043a0618cad24b904cdbc575c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Makan Delrahim, the head of the Justice Department's Antitrust Division, helped the planned merger of T-Mobile and Sprint.",51ba945e-af84-5185-a822-35370cd1354a,N24News/imgs/51ba945e-af84-5185-a822-35370cd1354a.jpg,20
Movies,"'Harpoon' Review: Three Friends, One Yacht, Copious Blood",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/movies/harpoon-review.html,"Rob Grant's ""Harpoon"" opens with a voice-over paraphrasing Aristotle: Some friendships, the philosopher theorized, are maintained out of convenience, some for pleasure, some for fulfillment. But sometimes, we are friends with people merely because, well, we used to be friends.

Those relationships, weakened by the passage of time and the changing of interests, are particularly prone to destruction, and ""Harpoon"" invites us to watch one such relationship go down in flames.

The friendship in question is between Jonah (a slippery Munro Chambers ), a hard luck case mourning the recent loss of his parents, and his old friend Richard ( Christopher Gray , convincing), who bursts through Jonah's door and beats him to a pulp. Richard suspects his pal of sleeping with his girlfriend, Sasha (the disarming Emily Tyra ); when the confusion is cleared up, Richie offers to make amends by taking them out on his pleasure yacht for a day of fun and frolic.

Economy,Job Growth Suggests Resilience of U.S. Recovery,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/business/economy/02jobs.html,"The United States economy showed signs of kicking into gear in March, adding 216,000 jobs and prompting President Obama to proclaim a corner finally turned. The president and his fellow Democrats pointed to the latest jobs report on Friday, and to an unemployment rate that fell a touch to 8.8 percent, as evidence that their policies, like stimulus spending and the payroll tax cut, were working. All of this, they made clear, could become ammunition in their showdown with House Republicans, who have spoken of cutting deeply into the federal budget and have threatened a government shutdown. An emboldened Mr. Obama spoke of the political implications before several hundred workers at a United Parcel Service shipping center in Landover, Md. ""If these budget negotiations break down, we could end up having to shut down the government, just at a time when the economy is starting to recover,"" Mr. Obama told the workers. ""So given the encouraging news we received today on jobs, it would be the height of irresponsibility to halt our economic momentum because of the same old Washington politics.""

Administration officials hit the same points over and over on Friday. The private sector has added, on average, 188,000 jobs in the first three months of 2011, and 1.8 million jobs since the recovery began. March was the 12th consecutive month of private sector job growth, and the stock market moved slightly higher on the report from the Labor Department. Manufacturing continued its unlikely -- if still modest -- revival in March, adding 17,000 jobs. Health care added 37,000 jobs in the month, and professional and business services added 78,000, although 37 percent of that came from increases in temporary help. The job figures for January and February were revised slightly higher, as well. Yet March's numbers also offered more than a few cautionary signs that the national economy was not cured of all its ills. The ranks of Americans who have been without a job for 27 weeks or more remain painfully high, at more than six million. And the labor force has shrunk steadily since the beginning of the recession, to a point that just 64.2 percent of adults are either in the work force or looking for a job. That is the lowest labor participation rate in a quarter-century. For several months now, economists have expressed hope that unemployed Americans will take heart from signs of new hiring and re-enter the work force. That did not happen in March; the labor participation rate was unchanged. ""It is still a very inhospitable market for unemployed workers,"" said Heidi Shierholz, an economist with the liberal Economic Policy Institute. ""We still have five unemployed workers for every opening, and those are desperate times.""

""With excess supply of labor at very high levels, it is unlikely that we are going to see any meaningful acceleration in wage rates anytime soon,"" Joshua Shapiro, an economist at MFR Inc., said Friday morning. Though the overall unemployment rate has fallen to 8.8 percent -- from 8.9 percent in February and from a peak of 10.1 percent in late 2009 -- the rate remains especially high for blacks, at 15.5 percent, and for Latinos, at 11.3 percent. (In 2007, black unemployment stood at 8.3 percent, and was 5.6 percent for Latinos.) In addition, local governments are experiencing a months-long bleed-off. Local governments have shed 416,000 jobs since an employment peak in September 2008, and dropped 15,000 jobs in March. Teenage unemployment remains off the charts and long-term unemployment is only a tenth of a point below its record peak, said Heather Boushey, senior economist at the Center for American Progress, a liberal group. ""Although, after years of watching things get worse, it's good to see overall employment growing."" The tension between Ms. Boushey's two views of the economy, its deep problems and distinct signs of hope, can be seen in a Bureau of Labor Statistics summary that breaks the economy into 16 sectors. It shows construction workers with a 20 percent unemployment rate, and hotel and leisure workers at 13.2 percent. Yet the jobless rate has dropped in 13 of the 16 sectors since March 2010.

It also poses a policy conundrum for the Federal Reserve, whose governors will meet in April to consider their interest rate policy. How should the board view the economy: Is the economic engine at last beginning to purr, in which case some argue for throttling back and raising rates later this year? Or are the weaknesses still pronounced enough that it makes sense to keep flooding the motor with inexpensive money? The Obama administration takes the view that it's too early to raise rates. Recoveries from financial shocks as severe as that of 2008 are often long and sluggish, and they argue against risking another setback. Another question is what the midterm future augurs. Will jobs continue to expand through the spring, and with enough vigor -- 300,000 a month, say -- to substantially reduce the unemployment rate? As Ms. Shierholz said, if the economy adds 200,000 jobs a month, it will be 2019 before it reaches the employment rate that preceded this recession. Many economists speak optimistically of the coming few months. ""The private sector of the economy has been the locomotive pulling the economy forward,"" said Sung Won Sohn, an economics professor at California State University, Channel Islands. ""Record exports, better-than-expected retail sales and the increase in business capital spending are part of the good news."" But some grow wary after that. The international storm clouds are many -- spectacular debt problems in Europe, uprisings sweeping the oil-rich Middle East, and Japan's many crises. The worry is that these ills might press on consumer and business confidence. ""The first half of this year will be the best job market that we'll see in this whole expansion,"" said David Levy of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center. ""After that, and looking toward 2012, the situation is questionable."" For now, the United States economy weathered last month's global storms and still gained a healthy number of jobs. Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, sounded content to leave it at that, for now. ""We don't totally know the answer"" about the effects of global turbulence, he said. ""For now, it's a good sign that you had winds in March that appeared to put a hit on consumer confidence and yet that did not slow the engine.""","The United States economy added 216,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department said, and the unemployment rate fell another jot, to 8.8 percent.",00897af3-3770-5eb7-94c9-8e46332d1e65,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/02/business/economy/02jobs-span/02jobs-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=3f1b56476e641e2f16f574836444b73be45904fcb227ee75398264ffbb95af45&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Job applicants in line at a job fair in San Jose, Calif., last week.",00897af3-3770-5eb7-94c9-8e46332d1e65,N24News/imgs/00897af3-3770-5eb7-94c9-8e46332d1e65.jpg,8
Sports,W.N.B.A. Star's Role in Freeing Man From Prison Shows Female Athletes at Forefront,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/sports/basketball/maya-moore-jonathan-irons-freed.html,"Still in her prime, Maya Moore sacrificed her career, stepping away as one of the greats in basketball for a long shot bid to help free a prisoner she was convinced had been wrongfully convicted. There would be no fifth W.N.B.A. championship, no bid for another Olympic gold medal, no fans gasping at the perfect jump shot. In a shock to the sport, she left the game -- temporarily, she said -- in early 2019 to free Jonathan Irons, a Missouri man who continuously claimed innocence as he served a 50-year prison sentence for burglary and assault with a gun.

""I'm pumped that people are understanding where the real change lies as far as giving something up,"" Moore said at a news conference on Thursday. ""That's all of us, giving something up, if you have any sort of power."" Athletes across sports have joined calls for social and racial justice, especially in the most recent wave spurred by deaths of Black people at the hands of the police. And female athletes like Moore have often been at the forefront but outside the limelight as men, working in leagues with higher television ratings, tend to get the lion's share of coverage. ""The N.B.A. and N.F.L. get noticed and the accolades, but the W.N.B.A and women in sport so often tend to be ahead of everybody else,"" said Victoria Jackson, a sports historian at Arizona State University. ""Look at Maya, she essentially gave up her career at a peak moment to put her heart and soul into this.""

Players like LeBron James garnered quick headlines with his backing of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, his heavy financial support of a public school in Akron, Ohio, his willingness to snipe back against conservative media pundits who say he should stick to sports. Colin Kaepernick and his kneeling during the national anthem has made an indelible image as he has remained a powerful, behind-the-scenes force for change while still unable to get a job in the N.F.L. since 2016. Yet the role of female athletes in this movement, including Moore's decision to back Irons and campaign for justice reform, seems to cycle in and out of the public consciousness, and is minimized. The reasons lie in a manifold mix that include race, the status of women in our society, and the way that women's sports still struggle for attention on the sports landscape. ""Part of the reason female athletes who speak out are so easily ignored, why we don't see or hear what they are doing, is that they barely have a mic to begin with,"" says Amira Rose Davis, an assistant professor at Penn State who specializes in race, sport and gender. ""It is hard enough to get women's sports on TV,"" or other powerful media, Davis added. ""So it is not really surprising in the moment that female athletes leading the fight for justice so often get overlooked. And that is a shame because these athletes, particularly Black women athletes, have consistently been some of the people taking the most decisive action, willing to sacrifice the most, giving up what crumbs they already have in pursuit of equality and justice.""

Take Ariyana Smith. She was the basketball player at Knox College in Illinois, who in 2014, shortly after a police officer shot and killed Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., walked to the court before a game with her hands raised in protest, then fell to the floor for four and a half minutes to symbolize the four and a half hours Brown remained in the street after he was killed. Her display of dissent and public mourning for Brown foreshadowed such protests in collegiate sports.

Players on college football teams like Oklahoma State, Kansas State and U.C.L.A. have received widespread attention over the past several weeks for speaking up against their coaches over issues related to race and their health in a deadly pandemic. But getting less national attention has been Anna Cockrell, an All-American hurdler at the University of Southern California, who recently announced the formation of a Black student-athlete association and is pressing the tradition-bound private university for change. There is also Christianna Carr, the Kansas State women's basketball player who has helped lead Black athletes to threaten to boycott playing until the university takes on-campus racism more seriously. In the National Women's Soccer League, starters from the Portland Thorns and the North Carolina Courage took a knee during the national anthem before the opening game, demanding change. Other clubs have followed suit. An entire team quitting en masse in the name of human rights and social justice? That's what the players on the professional, all-female, Scrap Yard Fast Pitch softball team did after a recent game. They left, for good, in defiance of a general manager who had bragged to President Trump on Twitter that the team was standing during the anthem, ascribing political intent behind the action. In a 2017 cover story for Sports Illustrated, Moore, now 31, was called the greatest winner in the history of women's basketball. It was a nod to her vast collection of championship titles in the Olympics and the pros, and before then at UConn and in high school. But even a performer as superlative as she is has faced constant struggles to be heard.

Shortly before her freshman season at the University of Connecticut in 2007, Moore met Irons through family members who had become close to him through a prison ministry. She and Irons formed a siblinglike bond, and as she learned more about the details of his case she vowed to help him prove his innocence. She first went public with her decision to leave basketball in order to help free Irons in a short essay in the Players' Tribune. It took months for her decision to make a deep impression with sports media and fans. When she walked the streets of Atlanta, her adopted hometown, few recognized her. Her story didn't garner anywhere near the attention that would have gone to a male player with her level of stature in the sport. Said Davis, the Penn State professor: ""When people are reporting on LeBron or the N.B.A. players doing something for society, and they know they need to nod to a woman they will be like, 'Oh, and there is also Maya Moore's work.' Generally, without deeply considering what it is she is doing and the sacrifice that is required."" Moore is hardly fazed. Like most female athletes, she is used to fighting against being overlooked. Four years ago, on the heels of the police killings of Philando Castile in a Minneapolis suburb and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, La., along with the murder of five police officers in Dallas by a gunman showing signs of mental health problems, Moore and her Minnesota Lynx teammates engaged in a potent protest. In pregame warm-ups they wore T-shirts with the names of Castile and Sterling, the Dallas police shield, and the phrases ""Justice and Accountability"" and ""Black Lives Matter."" The move proved controversial -- drawing the ire of the W.N.B.A., and prompting four off-duty Minneapolis police officers who worked security at Lynx' games to walk off the job -- but it soon spawned imitators and support from players across the league. Weeks later, Kaepernick knelt during the national anthem. Moore and her teammates were ahead of the curve.","Largely outside of the limelight, athletes like Maya Moore, who helped win the freedom of Jonathan Irons in a questionable conviction, have led the charge for social change.",19e208c6-b6ee-5c7d-8347-9e6f649b9d96,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/02/sports/02irons-folo-2/02irons-folo-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bab071f984b9a5d17bb8e942a0d82f6b3952d69871d6059d4ea2de8eebd9348a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Maya Moore, in mask, exulted as Jonathan Irons celebrated his release from prison in Missouri after burglary and assault charges were vacated.",19e208c6-b6ee-5c7d-8347-9e6f649b9d96,N24News/imgs/19e208c6-b6ee-5c7d-8347-9e6f649b9d96.jpg,9

Economy,Drivers Say Uber and Lyft Are Blocking Unemployment Pay,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/business/economy/coronavirus-uber-lyft-drivers-unemployment.html,"In a typical week, Jerome Gage, a Lyft driver in Los Angeles, makes $900 to $1,000 before expenses during roughly 50 hours on the road. This week, with most of the state holed up and demand for rides evaporating, he expects to work even longer to make far less than half that amount. Given the option, Mr. Gage said, he would stop wasting his time and risking his health and file for unemployment benefits. But unlike workers employed by restaurants, hotels and retail establishments, gig workers like Uber and Lyft drivers typically have not been able to collect unemployment benefits or take paid sick leave. In a call with analysts last week, the Uber chief executive, Dara Khosrowshahi, alluded to the problem, suggesting that his hands were tied because Uber drivers are independent contractors. ""This situation certainly demonstrates the downside of attaching basic protections to W-2 employment,"" he said. And in a letter to President Trump on Monday, Mr. Khosrowshahi asked that any economic stimulus or coronavirus-related legislation provide ""protections and benefits for independent workers,"" along with ""the opportunity to legally provide them with a real safety net going forward."" A Lyft spokeswoman said her company was also pushing to extend any forthcoming stimulus to drivers, and said, ""The vast majority of drivers on the Lyft platform use it to earn supplemental income,"" rather than as a primary job.

But for many drivers, the problem is not a legal void. It is that the companies they work for have not complied with existing laws or agency rulings. The highest-profile case is in California, which passed a law last year requiring companies to classify workers as employees if the companies control how they do the work, or if they hire workers to perform a job central to the business. The bill's author has said she intended the law to apply to Uber and Lyft drivers, which would make them eligible for unemployment benefits and state-mandated sick leave. Legal experts have agreed with this interpretation. But Uber launched a legal challenge to the law late last year, and the two ride-hailing companies are investing tens of millions of dollars in a November ballot initiative that would effectively exempt them from it.

Loree Levy, a spokeswoman for the California Employment Development Department, which oversees unemployment benefits, said by email that applicants who were not eligible for benefits because the state lacked their wage information could follow up, and that the department would investigate, awarding benefits if it deems them misclassified. She said the department investigated many such cases even without a follow-up, but declined to say whether it was working to require Uber and Lyft to report drivers' wages. Employers are obligated to contribute to a state unemployment insurance fund, but the companies' failure to do so does not disqualify workers from receiving benefits. The state can pursue unmet payroll-tax obligations later. Uber and Lyft declined to comment on the situation in California, but both companies have announced that they would provide pay to drivers nationwide who were diagnosed with Covid-19 or were asked by a public health authority to isolate themselves. The stalemate has set up a showdown with increasingly desperate drivers. On March 11, Shannon Liss-Riordan, a Boston-based plaintiff's lawyer who has won rulings against Uber and Lyft over the employment status of drivers, filed complaints seeking to force the companies to follow the state's new law immediately, giving drivers access to unemployment benefits and sick days.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""It is very unfortunate that such a crisis may be necessary to prompt these companies into actually complying with the law and extending employment protections to their drivers,"" Ms. Liss-Riordan said in an email. Her complaints are pending in federal court. While the cases play out, drivers around the state have stepped up efforts to demand that Uber and Lyft provide them with employment protections. A union-backed group called Mobile Workers Alliance, which Mr. Gage is involved with, began circulating a petition Friday demanding that the gig companies abide by the state's new law deeming them employees. The petition has collected more than 6,000 signatures. Lisa Opper, a Lyft driver involved with a group called Rideshare Drivers United, which held demonstrations on Thursday in San Diego, Los Angeles and San Francisco, said she typically worked 40 to 50 hours per week and made $900 to $1,000 before expenses. She made $226 the week before last, after which she stopped driving out of concern for her health.

""I won't risk it,"" Ms. Opper, who is 60 and diabetic, said on Friday. ""The virus is airborne, and I had three or four people last week coughing."" She said she had been driving with a blue surgical mask but didn't have access to the N95 mask that experts say is most effective at stopping the spread of the illness. Ms. Opper said she planned to file for unemployment insurance and hoped to get benefits, at least on appeal. ""I just believe Uber and Lyft are ignoring the law,"" she said. California is not the only state where many Uber and Lyft drivers have not received the employment protections to which they appear to be entitled. In 2018, New York's unemployment insurance appeal board, its highest executive branch authority on such questions, ruled that three Uber drivers were eligible for unemployment benefits, along with all ""similarly situated"" drivers. But New York State has yet to require Uber, Lyft and other gig economy companies to contribute to its unemployment insurance fund on workers' behalf -- a sum that would likely be worth at least tens of millions of dollars -- while it identifies which drivers are ""similarly situated"" to those in the appeal board's ruling. The companies have so far declined to report drivers' wages to the state, forcing drivers to undertake a monthslong bureaucratic process to prove their employment status and secure unemployment benefits. An Uber official said the company had received a request from the state for driver wage information over the weekend and was ""likely"" to comply. Still, an Uber spokesman said the company believed the appeal board's 2018 ruling ""uniquely applies to the three claimants"" because Uber has changed many of its policies affecting drivers in recent years. But Nicole Salk, senior staff attorney at Legal Services NYC, who has represented drivers seeking unemployment benefits, said she was personally aware of dozens of drivers who had been deemed employees by the state in the past few years.

The problem, Ms. Salk said, is that many other drivers have abandoned the process when faced with bureaucratic hurdles. ""There are at least three additional questionnaires,"" after the initial application, she said. ""It takes months and months."" Ms. Salk said she represented a driver who applied for benefits during the third week of December and had yet to complete the process. Last year, the federal Department of Labor and the National Labor Relations Board issued findings contending that gig workers are contractors, not employees, but those findings are not binding on state agencies that oversee unemployment benefits. A spokesman for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said the state had requested disaster unemployment assistance from the White House that could make benefits available to drivers and other gig workers. Congress, for its part, is working on a stimulus bill well in excess of $1 trillion that could make such benefits available nationally. But even if the contractor benefits are enacted, they may not apply to drivers in states where they have been deemed employees, according to Zubin Soleimany, a lawyer for the New York Taxi Workers Alliance, a driver advocacy group. Mr. Soleimany's group is pushing for New York to expedite the application process for those seeking routine unemployment benefits so that drivers can receive them promptly, like other workers. ""It's a completely unacceptable outcome now,"" he said.",States like New York and California have made gig workers eligible for jobless benefits and sick days.

Media,"Heavy Metal Magazine, Long a Provocateur, Returns to Its Roots",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/05/business/media/heavy-metal-magazine-long-a-provocateur-returns-to-its-roots.html,"Heavy Metal magazine, which will celebrate its 40th anniversary next year, is harking back to its past.

The publication, a science-fiction and fantasy illustrated bimonthly anthology that made its debut in 1977, is known for its provocative covers and mature content. But executives at the magazine felt it had strayed from its roots as a showcase for high-quality avant-garde art.

""It took a hard left at a certain point,"" said Jeff Krelitz, a co-owner and co-chief executive of Heavy Metal. Too much attention was focused on the magazine's cover, he said, which had ""a kind of cheesecake, soft-core feel to it.""

""We are taking things back to basics and putting a current spin on it,"" he said.

The overhaul was done for both creative and business reasons, Mr. Krelitz said. Focusing on newsstand sales, the magazine has bolstered its circulation, which is about 250,000 a year and supported by a strong subscriber base.","The science-fiction and fantasy publication, known for its mature content, aims to recapture its role as a showcase for avant-garde art.",d547701f-19f9-5ebb-b160-fc21852487ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/05/business/heavy/heavy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=87e404ce5eb2adaed1a57e87c9a065625df43b59db9c7441951c41063de8acaa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The art for Heavy Metal's latest cover, by Patrick Reilly, features a scantily clad warrior.",d547701f-19f9-5ebb-b160-fc21852487ff,N24News/imgs/d547701f-19f9-5ebb-b160-fc21852487ff.jpg,16
Music,Daniel Kramer Quits at English National Opera,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/17/arts/music/daniel-kramer-resigns-english-national-opera.html,"Arts Council England, the body that distributes funding for the British government, has significantly reduced the company's grant. The music director Mark Wigglesworth stood down after a hefty cut in 2016. The company has turned to renting its home out to other productions to make up the shortfall.

Mr. Kramer, an American director, had never held a position at an opera house before his appointment in August 2016, but he was brought in to revamp the organization. ""I could see they needed a leader who had some of the maps to come out of trauma into forward motion,"" he said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ""It felt like the opportunity of a lifetime,"" he added.

His first season met with mixed reviews.

Anthony Tommasini, writing in The Times, hailed a production of ""Porgy and Bess,"" for its ""emotional depth and belief in the characters."" It is transferring to the Metropolitan Opera in September. But that production was planned by Mr. Kramer's predecessor. A production of ""Jack The Ripper: The Women of Whitechapel,"" which focused on the Victorian murderer's victims, fared less well. The critic Hugh Canning called it ""an intriguing failure"" in a review in The Times of London.

A feminist reworking of ""Salome"" met with a similar reception. The Daily Telegraph's critic called it ""infuriatingly baffling"" and ""mightily pretentious,"" adding, ""I doubt the show's ambience will play out well with E.N.O.'s core audience.""

In a statement earlier this month announcing the company's new season, Mr. Kramer said, ""It is important that E.N.O. continues to push the boundaries of what is possible on the operatic stage and at the same time keep bringing in new audiences who may not have considered us before.""","The company's artistic director resigned, just two weeks after he announced his second season.",2a07bd06-3deb-5b83-b53e-cd961d546257,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/18/arts/17eno-item/merlin_137595501_61eb7099-bfeb-43c7-a1ec-8258e93496c2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c26cc28ed0694dac0f294e97468a5c7344a49c87cc66fd770c96fd89794c7fb2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Daniel Kramer at his home in London in May last year.

Health,Study Suggests Misplaced Fears in Longer Childbirths,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/06/health/childbirth-study-sees-longer-labor-as-normal.html,"Epidural anesthesia lengthens the second stage of labor, the one in which women push. But a study published on Wednesday has found that epidurals are associated with an even longer duration in the second stage than is generally recognized, suggesting that some women may be subject to unnecessary interventions by doctors who wrongly fear labor has become prolonged. The finding indicates that ""clinicians might need to wait later before intervening with oxytocin, forceps, vacuum or a cesarean,"" said Dr. S. Katherine Laughon, an investigator at the National Institutes of Health who was not involved in the study, which was published in Obstetrics and Gynecology. Still, she added, ""clinicians and women need to balance benefits of vaginal delivery with potential increases in risk for mom and baby."" Current guidelines by the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, or ACOG, define an abnormally long second stage as more than three hours for women who received an epidural and are giving birth for the first time, and more than two hours for first births without an epidural. The new study suggests a normal second stage can take as long as 5.6 hours for women who get epidurals during their first births, and as long as 3.3 hours for those who do not get epidurals.

For women who have given birth previously, the group's guidelines define an unusually long second stage as two hours with an epidural, one hour without. The new study found that the second stage for these women can be as long as 4.25 hours and 1.35 hours, respectively. ""This paper is very important, and ACOG needs to update its 2003 guidelines,"" said Dr. Robert L. Barbieri, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Women's in Boston, who was not involved in the new study. He added, ""I will change my practice and feel more comfortable going to five and a half hours with a first birth after an epidural with reassuring fetal monitoring."" Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, analyzed the records of 42,268 women who delivered vaginally without problems between 1976 and 2008. Roughly half had epidurals. The investigators compared the average length of the second stage of labor among women who had epidurals with that among women who did not. They also compared the upper limits of duration for both groups. Thirty-one percent of first births and 19 percent of subsequent labors would have been classified as abnormally long by the current ACOG definition, the researchers found.

""It's time to re-examine what normal and abnormal is, and revise our guidelines based on modern obstetric population,"" said Dr. Yvonne W. Cheng, the lead author of the study and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California, San Francisco. The research is part of a growing body of evidence suggesting that a normal second stage of labor is now longer than it was decades ago. In 2010, a study of more than 62,000 women found it was as long as 3.6 hours for first-time mothers after an epidural, and 2.8 hours for women who did not get one. A 2012 summary of a joint meeting of ACOG and the National Institutes of Health concluded that adequate time for each labor stage ""appears to be longer than traditionally estimated."" For the second stage, it is closer to four hours for first-time mothers who had epidurals, and three hours for those who did not. But this latest study is the first to suggest such an extended second stage may be ordinary. ""One of the messages of this study is, sit on your hands a little longer, don't rush into an instrumental vaginal delivery or a cesarean, because really everything could be fine,"" said Dr. Barbara Leighton, a professor of anesthesiology at Washington University in St. Louis School of Medicine, who has researched the effects of epidurals on labor. But while Dr. Leighton supports revising ACOG recommendations, she believes that the current study did not prove that longer labor is caused by epidural anesthesia. Women who request anesthesia may be predisposed to longer labor for other reasons, she said. Dr. Jeffrey Ecker, the chairman of the committee on obstetrics practice for ACOG, said today's clinicians are ""increasingly recognizing there can be healthy outcomes and vaginal deliveries of healthy babies when the second stage extends beyond how it's traditionally been defined."" He added, ""Often what's best and most appropriate -- and most difficult -- during labor is patience."" He would not say whether a revision of guidelines is in the works.","A finding that epidurals are associated with a longer duration in the second stage of labor indicates that doctors might need to wait more time before intervening with drugs, forceps or cesareans.",8257ba9f-2972-50ff-85c0-d6592498fb65,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/06/us/BIRTH/BIRTH-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=0ec8c27b227529b8946ff995b49df91d0b9494b310711dce149774e2f13efba0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A new study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests that women in labor may be subject to unnecessary interventions by doctors who wrongly fear labor has become prolonged.,8257ba9f-2972-50ff-85c0-d6592498fb65,N24News/imgs/8257ba9f-2972-50ff-85c0-d6592498fb65.jpg,1

Media,Apple's Big Spending Plan to Challenge Netflix Takes Shape,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/17/business/media/apple-content-hollywood.html,"Hollywood is going to Apple. On March 25, a delegation of producers, studio executives and big-name actors will enter the subterranean 1,000-seat Steve Jobs Theater in Cupertino, Calif., for one of those Apple showcases, with the chief executive, Tim Cook, commanding the stage before a crowd of loyalists. This time around, the focus won't be on the next must-have device. With iPhone sales showing signs of fatigue, the event is intended to draw attention to the company's billion-dollar-plus bet on entertainment, an initiative that will put Apple in direct competition with Netflix, Amazon and HBO. The premiere date for the service is getting closer, with the first of a dozen or more shows likely to start streaming before the year is out. At next week's presentation, Apple is expected to reveal details of what it has been working on with stars from both sides of the camera like Reese Witherspoon, Jennifer Aniston, Brie Larson, Jason Momoa, Octavia Spencer, J.J. Abrams, M. Night Shyamalan and Steven Spielberg. The tag line, ""It's show time,"" appeared prominently on the invitations. For many of the show business people, this will be their first trip to Cupertino, the corporate home of their new patrons.

Apple didn't need stars before, but it needs them now. Although the company was the first publicly traded American firm to be valued above $1 trillion, its most recent earnings report showed flat profits and falling revenue. So the plan now is not only to sell devices, but to fill them with content. That has led the company into the alien territory of Hollywood, where local customs can clash with Silicon Valley folkways. Apple is a relatively late arrival to streaming. Netflix, Amazon and Hulu have offered original programming for several years and are now formidable presences at the Emmys. In 2018, there were nearly 500 scripted television shows available in the United States, with Netflix spending at least $8 billion on new content. Amazon, the Walt Disney Company and Warner Media have increased their programming budgets to keep pace. Apple has decided to put more emphasis on its services -- think Apple Music and Apple Pay -- to increase revenues. The strategy will include an expansion of Apple News, which is expected to be highlighted at the showcase, and the star-studded streaming service. Apple has negotiated with the likes of HBO, Starz and Showtime to populate its screens, Bloomberg has reported, but the centerpiece will be original programming. The event at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino is also meant to drive home -- for iPhone fans and anyone in Hollywood who hasn't been paying attention -- just how many shows Apple has pulled together. Five series have completed filming. Around a half dozen more are on the verge of wrapping production, according to several people familiar with the shows who were not authorized to speak publicly. And the number of original productions is expected to increase in 2020.

With all that new material, Apple will transform itself, seemingly overnight, from a tech giant into a more general enterprise, with a slate of original entertainment offerings sizable enough to put it in a league with Showtime, Hulu or FX. Interviews with more than a dozen people who have had dealings with Apple, all of whom said they couldn't speak publicly about private discussions, suggest that, while the producers and stars appreciate having another deep-pocketed company to pitch, they also have ... well, let's call them concerns. Those concerns have arisen from the culture clash that may inevitably come about when a tech company that is used to guarding its trade secrets gets involved in show business, which runs on a stream of conversation, much of it of the just-between-us variety. Players expect to be kept in the loop. But many of the people working with Apple said they have received little or no information on how, exactly, their shows will be released. Or even when they will be released, other than a vague assurance of ""later this year, probably fall."" They also don't have a clear idea of Apple's marketing plans for the shows. Or what their colleagues in the newly built Apple stable are up to. Apple's entertainment team is based in Culver City, Calif., historically a center of moviemaking. It is led by two former Sony television executives, Jamie Erlicht and Zack Van Amburg, under the watch of the senior vice president of internet software and services Eddy Cue. Mr. Cue hired the Sony veterans in 2017, after Apple rolled out its first original series, a reality show called ""Planet of the Apps,"" which was a dud. About $1 billion was set aside for them to spend on programming, and they have blown well past that amount by now.

While Apple may be a late arrival to the streaming party, its showcase will take place two and a half weeks before Disney is expected to preview elements of its new streaming platform, and many months before Warner Media provides details of its version. Apple's entertainment team has not been totally opaque. It has provided feedback to individuals involved in the shows, but it has been tight-lipped about the marketing and rollout plans. The March 25 event may allay Hollywood's concerns, but several people involved in the new programs have interpreted the lack of communication as a sign that there may not be a clear game plan.

People involved in the coming series also said that Apple executives had expressed squeamishness when it comes to the portrayal of technology in the shows -- how exactly are you using that iPhone? Or that Mac laptop? Apple was sensitive to a reputation it earned, early on, as a home for uplifting programming, with little or no room for the gritty antihero fare that has defined many critically acclaimed series over the last two decades, from ""The Sopranos"" onward. Executives at the company bristled when they discovered there would be scenes involving crucifixes in Mr. Shyamalan's new thriller for the service, as The Wall Street Journal reported in September. But Apple ultimately allowed the crucifixes to remain, according to two people familiar with the series. Apple had no comment on any aspect of its streaming plans. Hollywood's concerns have not prevented big names from making deals with the company. In all, Apple has ordered roughly two dozen series from the likes of Oprah Winfrey, Damien Chazelle, Chris Evans and others. The producer J.J. Abrams has two Apple series in the works, one with Jennifer Garner, who played the lead in the Abrams-produced ABC series ""Alias,"" and a musical show starring the singer-songwriter Sara Bareilles that is about to go into production. Apple has also given the green light to animated ""Peanuts"" specials and children's shows made with Sesame Workshop, and it plans to round out its offerings with films it has acquired recently at Sundance and the Toronto International Film Festival. Here are the projects that have either completed filming or are nearing their wrap dates. They are the likeliest to appear in Apple's first wave of shows. Apple's splashiest project is a behind-the-scenes series about a morning TV show. The company committed itself to two full seasons before seeing a script. Along with Ms. Witherspoon and Ms. Aniston, who are also producers, the cast includes Steve Carell, Billy Crudup and Mark Duplass. The series had some backstage drama last year, when its showrunner, Jay Carson, Hillary Clinton's former press secretary and a supervising producer of ""House of Cards,"" was replaced by Kerry Ehrin, the co-creator of A&E's ""Bates Motel."" Brian Stelter, the CNN host and author of the 2013 book, ""Top of the Morning: Inside the Cutthroat World of Morning TV,"" serves as a consultant. Shooting for season one is nearly done.

An animated series -- with songs! -- from the ""Bob's Burgers"" creator, Loren Bouchard, the ""Frozen"" voice actor Josh Gad and the producer Nora Smith. Should be finished in the next few months. An unscripted series from the maker of ""Scotty and the Secret History of Hollywood"" and ""Studio 54"" that will take viewers inside lavish homes owned by non-celebrities. Expected to be finished in a few months. A new spin on the reclusive poet of Amherst, Mass., from the playwright Alena Smith, who has written for Showtime's ""The Affair"" and displayed her comedy chops with the cult Twitter account @TweenHobo and the 2014 novel ""Tween Hobo: Off the Rails."" It stars Hailee Steinfeld, of ""True Grit"" and ""Bumblebee,"" as the title character, and the ""30 Rock"" alumna Jane Krakowski as her mother.

Automobiles,A Navigation Program Switches to Maps Made by Volunteers,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/19/automobiles/a-navigation-program-switches-to-maps-made-by-volunteers.html,"Crowdsourcing is used to rate restaurants in Rotterdam, dentists in Duluth and contractors in Kalamazoo. But should you trust free, user-generated content to find your way home?

For the first time, according to Telenav, the navigation services company, an established navigation program is switching from professionally produced maps to crowdsourced maps whose data and updates are generated by volunteer contributors. Telenav, which currently uses TomTom maps in its Scout navigation app, will start to use crowdsourced maps from OpenStreetMap this week in the iOS version of its navigation software. The Android app will be similarly updated in June.

Until now, most makers of navigation apps have paid for commercially available maps such as those from TomTom and Nokia's Here (formerly Navteq). To generate the maps' data, those companies deploy professional cartography teams to travel roads around the world, marking name changes and speed limits, correcting intersection errors, and even noting roads that are closed during snow or monsoon seasons.

By contrast, OpenStreetMap is based on information provided by amateur users who send in corrections and road changes and voluntarily submit to GPS traces that track drivers' smartphones as they travel. The maps are in turn available free for anyone to use on websites or in software.",Telenav says its Scout navigation app will be the first to use crowdsourcing to keep the map data up to date.,5a77f2a5-c831-5515-a253-c4b81e30a56f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/20/automobiles/20TELNAV-image/20TELNAV-image-articleLarge.png?year=2014&h=1065&w=600&s=a6a9bec8efad21f43180a8ea38f45e85551cb2ffafe225451b37661e36cdc57c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Telenav says its Scout navigation app is the first to use crowdsourcing to keep maps current.,5a77f2a5-c831-5515-a253-c4b81e30a56f,N24News/imgs/5a77f2a5-c831-5515-a253-c4b81e30a56f.jpg,23
Art & Design,"Pierre Huyghe Reads Our Minds, and Discovers a New Art Form",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/11/arts/design/pierre-huyghe-serpentine-gallery-london-artist.html,"LONDON -- You wake up from a vivid dream, but find it's gone by daylight; you see something beautiful or surprising in the morning, but can't describe it fully by afternoon. What if you could just download your thoughts into images, without the intercession of memory or language? The French artist Pierre Huyghe wondered too, and his new exhibition here, made with the help of some ambitious neuroscientists and some nifty technology, suggests what the images in our heads might look like. Mr. Huyghe has always been a cerebral artist, but his new show here is cerebral in a literal way -- generated from consciousness itself. Mr. Huyghe's exhibition ""Uumwelt,"" which opened last week at the Serpentine Galleries in London's stately Kensington Gardens, offers something uncommon in an art setting: a wholly new kind of imagery. The artist collaborated with Japanese scientists who can translate M.R.I. scans into pictures, and the resultant, restless impressions of brain activity mutate and pullulate from frame to frame. The screens here have their own kind of life, and as you spend longer in the Serpentine's dimmed galleries the very boundaries between images and humans (and other living creatures) start to dissolve. Anyone who cares about the future of either art or neuroscience should see this commanding show, which, like all the best science fictions, offers equal amounts of hope and fright. It represents a return to the controlled spaces of museums after some of Mr. Huyghe's acclaimed recent environmental projects, like his transformation of an abandoned German skating rink into a posthuman ecosystem at last year's Munster Sculpture Project, though this new show, too, is a living garden in its own way.

At the Serpentine, Mr. Huyghe -- it's pronounced WEEG, one syllable, silent H -- has shaded the skylights, busted up some walls, and installed five free-standing LED screens on which images flicker past, dozens of times per second. The images are fuzzy and jerky, often in a Gustonish palette of pinks and reds and grays, and for fleeting milliseconds they seem to depict objects or animals against a plain white background. But they never stay put for long. The images spawn bulbous deformations, then transform again. (A soft, clicking ambient score provides a beat, and links the work to Mr. Huyghe's early videos backed by musique concrete; the walls have been sanded down to reveal earlier paint jobs, and sawdust scents the rooms.)

These images were not made with a camera; what we are looking at are endless frantic attempts to render human thoughts into visual form. Mr. Huyghe collaborated with the neuroscientist Yukiyasu Kamitani, whose lab at Kyoto University has developed artificial intelligence software that decodes human brain activity and renders it as images. In Kyoto Mr. Huyghe had participants enter an M.R.I. scanner and look at pictures or think about ideas; then he used Mr. Kamitani's software to represent the neural activity. The artist has retouched these products of consciousness only slightly; the images I have seen from Mr. Kamitani's lab appear nearly identical to stills of Mr. Huyghe's videos.

They are perplexing to watch, but engrossing. On the first screen I thought I saw a chick or a frog taking shape, though the creature would palpitate into an egg, a lumpen lime or a blastula of germinating cells. The screen in the Serpentine's western gallery appeared to depict a nude of unknown gender; I thought I saw a bra at several points before it blistered for milliseconds at a time. The most abstract of the screens has the appearance of a blurred Gerhard Richter seascape at moments, while the most solidly representational of them oscillates between a Pomeranian puppy and that creepy kid's toy known as Furby. The images are never complete, in a perpetual process of becoming -- and that may be the most human, and disconcerting, thing about them. Many artists today are exploring artificial intelligence, but imagistic expressions of AI in the gallery have been largely trite, relying far too much on received appearances from the video game developers of Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. Mr. Huyghe's flickering screens, by anxious contrast, have the breath of life. What we are looking at is 100 dogs, 1,000 seascapes, formed pixel by pixel out of the human brain and an ever-growing database.

Mr. Huyghe shot to prominence in the late 1990s, alongside his Parisian colleagues Philippe Parreno and Dominique Gonzalez-Foerster, with a series of videos and performances that revealed the subtle workings of narrative and ideology in contemporary media. In works like ""The Third Memory"" (2000) and ""Streamside Day Follies"" (2003), the artist choreographed scenarios for performers or participants, who would then be free to behave as they wished within his scheme. He would carry through this half-defined, half-open technique in his later environments; now he devises complex collections of living and dead elements, which propagate and transform over time without the artist's intervention. At the Munster skating rink, algae blossomed in standing pools, peacocks strutted about, and human cancer cells metastasized in an incubator.

Ants and bees, an adorable dog and even a mysterious albino penguin have played a critical role in these installations, chosen because animals behave in ways the artist cannot control. Here at the Serpentine, Mr. Huyghe has unleashed some 10,000 flies into the galleries, seen resting on the screens or lying dead under your feet. The museum itself becomes a living, mutating ecosystem, and even the images on the screens are modified throughout the day, triggered by sensors that respond to temperature and humidity. Note the exhibition's title, ""Uumwelt"": the German word for ""environment"" rendered, like the neuroscientific images here, with a stutter. What makes the Serpentine show such a landmark is that it fuses the strains of Mr. Huyghe's art -- the earlier media strain and the later ecological strain -- in a fashion that feels utterly contemporary. He has never given up on images during the environmental phase of his career; his lugubrious ""Untitled (Human Mask),"" completed in 2014, was a relatively straightforward narrative film that tracked a monkey in post-tsunami Fukushima. Yet here at the Serpentine, images themselves have a biological character that makes them more than mere representations of ecological change. The pictures are themselves ""alive,"" biotic, reacting to stimuli and growing in sophistication, and the show thus comprises a grand assemblage of real and artificial intelligences: the Japanese participants and the lab's software, the flies' little brains and our big ones. You begin to understand, as Mr. Huyghe's brain scans wash over you, how images are part of the environment and climate is a kind of culture. Critics aren't supposed to have favorite artists. We're supposed to look without favor, to come to passionate conclusions through dispassionate observation. But I can't deny that Mr. Huyghe, for two decades now, has been the artist I trust most to forge a new art out of our present media chaos and ecological degradation. (I do think he took a wrong turn around 2010 with ""The Host and the Cloud,"" his overwrought 3-hour film with rutting Parisiennes and the Trix bunny, and the boulders and trilobites he placed on the roof of the Met in 2015 were an underwhelming cop-out.) I have checked my gut a lot this week as I've contemplated these freakish moving images, asking myself where the border lies between science and art and whether I cut him too much slack. And what I come back with, still, is that ""Uumwelt"" is a breakthrough of immense importance, because it both charts a path forward for artists and universalizes the act of artistic creation. Early on in ""The Lives of the Artists,"" the foundational text of Renaissance art history, Giorgio Vasari explains that a great artist does not accurately reproduce the world, but draws forth images da se, ""from himself,"" in an act of skilled imagination. What Mr. Huyghe has proved -- confoundingly, thrillingly -- is that artistic creation could be a general tendency, not even limited to our own species, if we provided everyone the right tools. Those flies buzzing about, whose compound eyes can see Mr. Huyghe's flickering screens four times more clearly than we can, could have their own museum exhibition soon.","In a commanding new exhibition at London's Serpentine Galleries, the French artist makes images directly from brain activity — and adds 10,000 flies for good measure.",53dc43a2-1209-5e93-b740-20be520331bc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/19/arts/19huyghe3/15huyghe3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=451ba0c95d7b115f6ce605541d15de882fda32cd62f4b3e8ee25e2e1c60892eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Installation view of Pierre Huyghe&rsquo;s &ldquo;Uumwelt&rdquo; at the Serpentine Galleries in London.,53dc43a2-1209-5e93-b740-20be520331bc,N24News/imgs/53dc43a2-1209-5e93-b740-20be520331bc.jpg,14
Books,"Real Estate, Parking and Violence: A Novel of New York",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/03/books/review/alternate-side-anna-quindlen.html,"If a novel about ""first-world problems,"" as Nora's daughter calls them, already has you rolling your eyes, remember that Quindlen, who won a Pulitzer Prize for commentary while a New York Times columnist, is one of our most astute chroniclers of modern life. This novel may be too quiet for some, too populated with rich whiners for others, but it has an almost documentary feel, a verisimilitude that's awfully hard to achieve. There's no moment that feels contrived or false, except perhaps to non-New Yorkers who may find it impossible to believe that anyone would consider $350 a month for a parking space a bargain too good to pass up.

The story is told from Nora's point of view. Much like Quindlen, she's a sensitive and introspective observer of people and what makes them tick. She's also keenly aware that the residents of her tightknit block are white and the nannies, housekeepers and handymen who work for them are not.

This factors into the story when her handyman, Ricky, inadvertently blocks access to the parking lot and a neighbor with well-established anger management issues takes a 3- iron to his van, shattering the handyman's leg when he intervenes.

Charlie witnesses the incident; Nora happens upon it, returning from a jog. And when Charlie sides with the neighbor, a crack develops in the neighborhood's facade, affecting everyone, but none more than the Nolans.

Charlie isn't, by any stretch, a terrible husband. He isn't having an affair with a much younger woman and he's not engaged in financial shenanigans. When the twins were younger, he was an attentive father. But he can't shake the feeling that Nora settled for him when they married, and he's frustrated by his inability to be somebody in the business world. Perhaps only in New York would a man's climb up the ladder be permanently halted when he's thought to be too decent: ""Over the years his colleagues had waited for the shark to emerge from behind the nice guy, the wolf in sheep's clothing to make an appearance, the open-faced mask to drop. Nora suspected that when they realized it was not a mask at all, they had begun to value Charlie less.""","The married couple in Anna Quindlen's ""Alternate Side"" would seem to have everything.

Media,Spotify Files to Go Public on the New York Stock Exchange,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/business/media/spotify-ipo.html,"Spotify has already won over the music industry, and listeners worldwide, with an online streaming service that makes millions of songs instantly available. Now, it is ready to test its business model on Wall Street. On Wednesday, the company filed a prospectus to sell shares on the New York Stock Exchange, an indication of the imminent arrival of one of the most anticipated technology stocks in years. It was also a signal of the maturation of the streaming market that has already begun to revive the long-struggling music industry. Instead of a traditional initial public offering, Spotify will, as expected, pursue a direct listing of its shares, an unusual process in which no new stock is issued -- and therefore no money is raised. However, existing investors and insiders can trade their shares on the open market. But because Spotify is eschewing Wall Street banks to manage the raising of new capital, the listing could face a rockier reception in the markets. Those banks typically spend weeks assessing investor demand for a company's shares and try to match the amount that hits the market to ensure the shares are supported.

According to the prospectus, investors trading Spotify's shares in private transactions have valued the company as highly as $23 billion. Spotify's shares will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT, but there is no indication of when that will begin. The company, showing no shortage of ambition, said that its mission was ""to unlock the potential of human creativity by giving a million creative artists the opportunity to live off their art and billions of fans the opportunity to enjoy and be inspired by these creators."" For the music industry, Spotify -- and the streaming model it has championed -- has been a powerful engine. After more than a decade of decline, the global music market began to turn around in about 2015, just as streaming began to take hold. In the United States, for example, streaming now accounts for about two-thirds of recorded music revenues, according to the Recording Industry Association of America, and streaming platforms like Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube and SoundCloud have become the new outlets where stars develop and hits are minted. Even so, many artists remain skeptical of the streaming economy, which heavily rewards mainstream hits but has drawn complaints from other songwriters and musicians, particularly those outside the sphere of pop, who feel they are not being adequately compensated for their work.

Spotify's prospectus is the most detailed disclosure the company has given about its business. According to the filing, Spotify, which began its streaming service in Sweden in 2008 and came to the United States three years later, had nearly $5 billion in revenue in 2017, up 38.6 percent from the year before. In 2016, it had grown by 52 percent.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. By the end of 2017, Spotify, whose full name is Spotify Technology, had 159 million active users, including 71 million who pay for subscriptions; the rest, using the ""freemium"" model that has become Spotify's marketing hallmark, get free access to music but are subjected to advertisements. As quickly as Spotify has grown, though, so have its losses. Last year, it had a net loss of $1.5 billion, up from about $650 million the year before. Its largest expense, by far, is the cost of licenses from record companies and music publishers. The prospectus also highlights Spotify's successes, and its value to the music industry. Through the end of last year, the company had paid more than $10 billion in music royalties since its inception, and its ""churn"" -- a measure of how many paying users cancel each month -- has been steadily declining, to 5.5 percent in 2017 from 7.7 percent in 2015. The largest stakes are owned by its two founders: Daniel Ek, the chief executive and the company's public face, and Martin Lorentzon, who holds no executive position. In addition to their shares, they also have ""beneficiary certificates"" granting them extra voting rights. In total, Mr. Ek has 37.3 percent voting power over the company, and Mr. Lorentzon 43.1 percent, according to the prospectus. The major record labels also own minority stakes in the company, as a result of licensing deals struck over the years. Sony has the largest, with 5.7 percent; the others were not disclosed. Spotify's major competitor is Apple, whose co-founder Steve Jobs had long disdained music subscriptions. Apple finally entered the streaming subscription business in 2015 with Apple Music, and recently said that it had 36 million paying users. But according to a recent report in The Wall Street Journal, Apple Music has been outpacing Spotify in its growth in paid subscribers in the United States.

The market for public offerings has been robust so far this year. Through late February, 30 companies listed their shares publicly on markets in the United States, raising $11.4 billion from investors. That was the strongest annual start for the market since 2000, according to data from Thomson Reuters. At least some of the highly valued, privately held technology companies, known as unicorns, could move quickly to capitalize on the opportunity and sell shares publicly. Last week, for instance, the online file storage company Dropbox, valued by the private markets at about $10 billion, filed paperwork to raise up to $500 million in an initial public offering. But to convert that paper wealth into actual cash at top dollar, early-stage investors, company founders and employees with stock options need receptive public markets to buy their shares. If the public investors do not think the companies are worth as much as the small number of deep-pocketed investors who dominate the private markets, it could mean the large amounts of paper wealth could be vaporized once the company's shares start trading. That's effectively what happened last year, when some prominent public offerings fizzled once the shares were trading publicly. Shares of Snap, the start-up behind the popular Snapchat app, surged when it went public last March, but it has since had difficulty staying above its offering price of $17 a share. And the meal-delivery start-up Blue Apron, which went public at $10 a share last June, is now trading at less than $3 a share. Given that it involves a direct listing, Spotify's debut on the public markets has the potential to be even more volatile.","Instead of a traditional public offering, the streaming music service will pursue a direct listing of its shares, which will be traded under the ticker symbol SPOT.",682cbfcf-e4ab-5345-9c1f-fb3d245e3b8c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/01/business/01SPOTIFY1/01SPOTIFY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e2ea0cc00f824758175edde5916d53d9fcfafef486094a2c5ea833b1080dbccd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daniel Ek, the chief executive and a co-founder of Spotify.

Theater,George Bernard Shaw's 6-Hour 'Beast'? She's All In,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/19/theater/shaw-festival-man-and-superman.html,"In the space of less than an hour, these were just a few of the terms of endearment lobbed from the dimly lit seats of the Festival Theater, one of the three venues that make up the Shaw Festival campus. Tech rehearsals -- the millisecond-by-millisecond calibration of every lighting cue and sound effect -- can sap the will of even the hardiest theater folk. But Kimberley Rampersad, the issuer of those kind words, wasn't having it one recent afternoon. Not with the festival's marquee event entrusted to her -- on just her second time directing here. A bronze statue of George Bernard Shaw may stand in the center of this bucolic town 20 miles north of Niagara Falls, but only two plays by the festival's namesake are on offer in this year's 11-play season. Some would argue, however, that there are actually three Shaws in a 12-play season. Because one of the two -- the one that Ms. Rampersad was overseeing -- is the ""glorious beast"" (to use her phrase) known as ""Man and Superman,"" which took Shaw a decade to see mounted in its entirety. Ms. Rampersad had her work cut out for her.

The play's 1905 premiere came minus its third act, an extended dream sequence known as ""Don Juan in Hell,"" in which four of the play's characters morph into their 16th-century forebears. Several theater companies have embraced Act III's blend of philosophical phantasmagoria and staged it on its own; others have jettisoned it and zipped ahead to the fourth and final act. Many others have taken one look at the published script (complete with a 58-page appendix devoted to the lead character's ""Revolutionist's Handbook and Pocket Companion"") and opted for ""Pygmalion"" instead. The Shaw Festival, however, is all in -- with a full six hours (including a lunch break) given over to Shaw's musings on anarchy, proto-feminism, the Fabian Society and many, many, many other ideas. It began last weekend and will be performed a total of 17 times through Oct. 5 .

""'Man and Superman' is one of the reasons I took this job,"" said Tim Carroll, who became artistic director of the festival in 2017. ""I really think it's one of the great things made by a human, right up there with [Bach's] B minor Mass and 'The Magic Flute.'"" But what human should direct it? Here Mr. Carroll's decision-making process was informed by his own experience working for Mark Rylance at Shakespeare's Globe Theater in London.

""Early in my time there, Mark approached me about what I wanted to do the following year, before he saw what I did,"" Mr. Carroll recalled. ""I asked him, 'Don't you want to see how this goes first?' And he said, 'I trust you.' ""I've been a freelancer most of my life, and I came here determined not to forget how that feels."" Enter Ms. Rampersad, a midcareer dancer and choreographer from Winnipeg who first came to the festival in 2015 to appear in both ""Sweet Charity"" and ""Pygmalion."" (The use of repertory casting, a hallmark of the festival, means all 13 ""Man and Superman"" cast members are also appearing in either ""Cyrano de Bergerac"" or Howard Barker's scabrous play ""Victory"" -- though never on the same day.) She returned in 2017 as one of the festival's intern directors, where she assisted Mr. Carroll on Shaw's audience-friendly ""Androcles and the Lion."" On the strength of this apprentice work, he asked her to direct the following season's lunchtime one-act, ""O'Flaherty V.C.,"" also by Shaw. (He also cast her in ""Grand Hotel"" that year.) Then, before ""O'Flaherty"" even opened, he followed Mr. Rylance's example and offered her ""Man and Superman."" ""She's a first-class motivator and setter of example,"" Mr. Carroll said. ""And she clicked with Bernard Shaw right away, as I learned from 'Androcles.'""

""He's an industry,"" she said of Shaw, ""but he's also a lens on the world. And every time we solve one of his mysteries in the rehearsal room, two new ones pop up."" And then there's the 80-minute mystery known as ""Don Juan in Hell,"" which many Shaw scholars have argued fares better as its own entity. Ms. Rampersad disagrees. ""It adds the magic to the play,"" she said. ""It adds the cosmos, which then gives real gravitas to Act IV. To me, it's a golden thread that would be missing from this tapestry if it wasn't there."" Finding room for the magic but also the logic is where Ms. Rampersad's gifts come to the forefront, said Sara Topham, who plays the enigmatic female lead in ""Man and Superman."" ""Kim has an insatiable drive for explanation, which is vital for any director,"" Ms. Topham said. ""The only word I can think of to describe her is 'extraordinary.'"" Ms. Topham's co-star Gray Powell also commended Ms. Rampersad's knack for making these idea-stuffed plays accessible to the audience. ""The clarity of the arguments is the toughest thing about Shaw -- they need to sound like real thoughts happening in real time,"" he said. ""And Kim really gets that."" Mr. Carroll's faith in her surfaced in another way this year: He and his associate artistic director, Kate Hennig, created the new position of intern artistic director. ""Kate and I were looking at the Canadian theater landscape,"" he said, ""and we thought, 'We really should be setting Kim up to land one of those big jobs.'""

She is automatically invited to every one of Mr. Carroll's meetings -- there are many -- and the two meet at least once a week to discuss big-picture ideas as well as scheduling minutiae. (Not that her other skills have been forgotten: Ms. Rampersad will appear in the festival's ""Holiday Inn"" this winter and then direct as well as choreograph ""Gypsy"" here in 2020.) ""It is an opportunity for me to learn what it means to hold spaces for other people,"" she said of the new position. ""The role of artistic director is where my art meets my politics."" But first Ms. Rampersad needs to wrangle Shaw's towering work -- which she described as about ""getting off on the rigor of being your best self and getting others to be their best selves"" -- up from hell and back to earth. And as she slips in and out of all (or at least a fair number) of those meetings, she said she returns to ""Man and Superman"" buoyed by her boss's rallying cry, one that emphasizes both rigor and abandon. ""Tim's like, 'Go, go! Be excellent, but go!'""","A dancer turned director, Kimberley Rampersad is  tackling ""Man and Superman"" at the Shaw Festival.",f23e5904-a6e5-5bf1-9fce-8295b08c2889,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/20/arts/18shawfest1/18shawfest1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9d7c568371302ecc95fed1d0749be51fcc239b53051815f973a4a98a661a5d02&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kimberley Rampersad, director of the Shaw Festival&rsquo;s production of &ldquo;Man and Superman,&rdquo; at the Shaw Festival Theater.",f23e5904-a6e5-5bf1-9fce-8295b08c2889,N24News/imgs/f23e5904-a6e5-5bf1-9fce-8295b08c2889.jpg,10
Health,Scientists Link a Gene Mutation to Rheumatic Heart Disease,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/29/health/rheumatic-heart-disease-strep-genes.html,"Whether a painful strep throat turns into a fatal case of heart disease depends not just on prompt antibiotic treatment but also on the patient's genetic makeup, according to a new study led by Oxford University scientists.

The discovery could help the long fight to find a vaccine against Group A streptococcus bacteria, which cause strep throat, scarlet fever and rheumatic heart disease. (Antibiotic-resistant versions of the same pathogen that get under the skin can rot muscles away and are sometimes called flesh-eating bacteria.)

About 15 million people around the world have rheumatic heart disease, scarring of the heart valves that can lead to early death unless the valve is surgically repaired or replaced.

The disease is mostly a relic of the past in rich and middle-income countries, where pediatricians quickly treat strep throat and rheumatic fever in children, which causes the joint pain once called childhood rheumatism.","Patients with strep infections were far more likely to suffer damaged heart valves if they had a certain mutation, researchers reported.",ad55c919-01b5-55d2-98d2-e8cd43fa4826,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/30/science/30GLOBAL/30GLOBAL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a32df0401b4b372822b2a6af74e3140209d9a664779b9fe6c4d1c9a50ab4d5d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An X-ray of the greatly enlarged heart of a patient with rheumatic heart disease.,ad55c919-01b5-55d2-98d2-e8cd43fa4826,N24News/imgs/ad55c919-01b5-55d2-98d2-e8cd43fa4826.jpg,1
Music,Daniel Barenboim's Contract Is Extended Despite Bullying Accusations,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/arts/music/daniel-barenboim-staatsoper-berlin.html,"BERLIN -- Daniel Barenboim, the venerated musical director of Berlin's Staatsoper who was accused this year by some of its orchestra members of creating a culture of bullying and a ""climate of fear"" in the institution, has had his contract extended until 2027. The decision was announced at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon by Klaus Lederer, Berlin's highest-ranking representative for culture. Mr. Barenboim's contract had been set to expire in 2022. In a statement, Mr. Lederer described Mr. Barenboim as an ""exceptional artist,"" and said that a third-party investigation initiated by Berlin's culture ministry this year, had found that ""none of the legally relevant accusations could be confirmed."" Mr. Barenboim, 76, is one of the world's most admired conductors and a high-profile public figure in the German capital. Alongside his musical leadership of the Staatsoper, the city of Berlin's premier opera house, and his position as principal conductor of the Staatskappelle, as its orchestra is called, he has founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, a youth ensemble with members from across the Middle East, and a conservatory and a concert hall.

The investigation did find that there was room for improvement in the institution's working climate, Mr. Lederer said, and as a result, an ombudsperson would be introduced to mediate disputes. ""Today was only the beginning of a process of change"" to improve working conditions, he said, adding that ""artistic excellence should never excuse a deviation from the rules of careful interaction among people."" Mr. Lederer also noted that ""the large majority of the orchestra"" wanted Mr. Barenboim to remain. Berlin's culture ministry was unable to immediately clarify the standards for misconduct used by the investigation. The accusations against the conductor first appeared in February in an article in VAN, an online classical music magazine in which current and former employees described numerous instances of bullying, including temper outbursts and the public berating of staff members. Willi Hilgers, a former timpanist with the Staatsoper, later described to The New York Times being repeatedly singled out by Mr. Barenboim for humiliation in front of the rest of the musicians, leading to ""high blood pressure, depression"" and a need to use beta blockers and antidepressants before performances. In an email to The New York Times in February, Mr. Barenboim said he sometimes used a ""harsh tone"" with employees, but disputed being a ""bully"" and argued that the accusations had been suspiciously timed to coincide with his contract renegotiations. Speaking at the news conference Tuesday, Mr. Barenboim said, ""I am very thankful that the orchestra wants me to continue.""

Leo Siberski, the music director of the Plauen-Zwickau Theater in Germany who played trumpet under Mr. Barenboim from 1992 to 2003, in February accused the conductor of having bullied and humiliated him and other members of his orchestra. In a phone interview on Tuesday, after the announcement, he said that he had spoken with the third-party organization that looked into the allegations. He said the investigators' questions were directed at whether incidents crossed legal boundaries, rather than centering on irresponsible behavior. ""They were only interested in black-and-white things and of course, this case is not black and white,"" he said. Of Mr. Barenboim's contract extension, Mr. Siberski said he didn't care what happened to his former boss anymore. ""I said what I said, and I'm very happy I did,"" he explained. ""It's Berlin's business now. Whatever they feel is best for Berlin, is best for them."" As for Mr. Barenboim, when asked Tuesday what personal reflections he had in the wake of the accusations, he responded only that he would ""tell that to the orchestra."" Susanne Schergaut, a member of the orchestra leadership, said that as a result of the controversy, the conversations in the organization about disagreements had gotten more ""intensive."" She pushed back against media reports, saying that ""we don't want our relationship to our boss to be explained to us from the outside."" Thomas Rogers reported from Berlin and Alex Marshall from New York.","Berlin's culture minister said an investigation had found that ""none of the legally relevant accusations"" against the Staatsoper's music director could be confirmed.",74338fff-fbb0-53ea-a793-d72f0ae2f5be,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/05/arts/04barenboim/04barenboim-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=585a9ca54fde4c02bb8fc06909adc14d1064df0ff4e053f92f68048b3b669a15&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daniel Barenboim, at the news conference on Tuesday at which Klaus Lederer, a representative for culture of Berlin, announced the extension.",74338fff-fbb0-53ea-a793-d72f0ae2f5be,N24News/imgs/74338fff-fbb0-53ea-a793-d72f0ae2f5be.jpg,12

'LOUISE LAWLER: WHY PICTURES NOW' at the Museum of Modern Art (through July 30). One of the great light-heavyweights of the 1980s Pictures Generation, an artist of stealth, wit and elegant understatement, adept at playing the art world against itself, receives her due in a beautiful show of mostly her own design. With images sometimes near billboard size, it contrasts her uncanny gift for photographing artworks in their natural habitats (galleries, museums, collectors' homes, auctions) and her equal talent for graphic design and carefully worded aphorisms.

'FLORINE STETTHEIMER: PAINTING POETRY' at the Jewish Museum (through Sept. 24). This too-small retrospective nonetheless decimates modernism's orderly hierarchies. Mixing Symbolist dreaminess with Post-Impressionist muscle, Stettheimer rendered her family and New York's interwar avant-garde as charmed, eccentric, usually androgynous caricatures in textured expanses of brilliant color. Her singular paintings are among the most spellbinding and enduring in the history of art and the best, with Marsden Hartley's, of early American modernism. They do quite well against the Europeans, too, thank you very much. (Smith)

Food,Eli Zabar's Wine Cellar: It's Not Chopped Liver,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/16/dining/elis-zabars-wine-cellar.html,"Many New Yorkers know at least something about Eli Zabar. They can probably guess that his family opened the Upper West Side emporium that stands for classic New York eating. They may know that he left that business decades ago to open his own store on the Upper East Side, E.A.T., followed by Eli's at the Vinegar Factory, and that his markets and takeout shops now dominate the neighborhood above 79th Street. They can assume that Eli's Bread, sold in restaurants and shops all over New York, comes from his bakeries. They may even be aware of Mr. Zabar's reputation for treating his customers arrogantly and charging high prices. Not so many know that Mr. Zabar is a longtime wine lover, with an extraordinary collection of Burgundy and a deep interest in Barolo, Barbaresco and the northern Rhone. Mr. Zabar owns an excellent under-the-radar, typically quirky wine shop on the Upper East Side called Eli's List, right next door to his restaurant Eli's Table, which offers a terrific wine list with many bottles 10 to 25 years old. Many people would be astonished to find great values on this list, and not just in expensive bottles. And they may be pleased to know that a branch of Eli's Essentials, his takeout shop and cafe at Madison Avenue and 91st Street, turns into a charming wine bar after 5 p.m.

Mr. Zabar said he never intended to go into the wine business. He opened his wine shop in 2002, he said, as a convenience to his wine-drinking customers at Eli's Market on Third Avenue, so he could offer one-stop shopping. That was, he now concedes, a rationalization for doing what he wanted: to accumulate a lot of wine. ""It was antithetical to the rest of my businesses, which are based on buying fresh and selling fast,"" he said at the wine shop, preternaturally blue eyes peering over the top of his glasses. ""You're not going to save a carrot for two months."" Mr. Zabar, 72, exudes the nervous energy of a teenager. Words tumble out on top of one another, disparate thoughts that, in his eagerness to discuss wine, can seem at first to lack an organizing principle, until they finally align and fall into place. One dress shirt is not enough; he wears two at once, with khakis and a down vest. The layers come in handy in the cramped, mazelike wine cellar under Eli's Market, where, stacked at a cool 55 degrees, lie cases upon cases of bottles that would stir the imagination of any Burgundy lover. Sure, he has some superstar names: Roumier of Chambolle-Musigny and Rousseau of Gevrey-Chambertin among the reds; Raveneau of Chablis, Roulot of Meursault and Leflaive of Puligny-Montrachet among the whites.

But even more evident is his exquisite taste. His cellar is replete with the work of producers who have not been sanctified as superstars and are not known for their grand crus, but who simply make beautiful, expressive wines whatever their terroirs. These include names like Domaine Arlaud Pere et Fils, Domaine Trapet, Alain Burguet, Sylvain Cathiard, Mugneret-Gibourg, Denis Bachelet and Michel Lafarge. ""These are not trophy wines,"" Mr. Zabar said. ""That's not my point of view."" This cellar is practically all Burgundy, except for some Champagne. Mr. Zabar has another cellar for his Rhones and Barolos under Eli's Night Shift on East 79th Street, a grab-and-go store that turns into a beer bar by night, run by his son Oliver.

As a young merchant setting out in the 1970s, Mr. Zabar said, he allowed his imperiousness to define his business. He was obsessive about the quality of every piece of cheese and each bottle of oil. He learned to cook and bake so that all the prepared foods he sold were made either by his own hand or from his recipes. ""I only sold what I liked, and if you were offended, too bad,"" he said. ""I was offensive to many customers. I can't even believe some of the things I said."" He has mellowed somewhat. He can't quite exert the control he desires over his markets, except in his wine shop. ""I've gotten away from that; it didn't work in groceries,"" he said. ""But this wine store is a continuation of that attitude."" Indeed, he sells only wines he likes. He does not stock Bordeaux. ""I've never liked Bordeaux -- I never liked the cabernet grape,"" he said. He said he doesn't know enough about German wines to sell them, and carries wine from only one American producer, Hermann J. Wiemer of the Finger Lakes, because he loves the riesling.

His attachment to Burgundy, though, runs deep. He sees in the Burgundian vignerons the same obsessive concern with craft and quality that he felt as a young man. ""There was a part of me in each bread, each chicken salad I sold,"" he said. ""In Burgundy, they are invested in a way only somebody who works with their hands can be."" Though he knows what he likes, Mr. Zabar does not pretend to be a wine connoisseur. He often defers to his associates: Randall Restiano, his wine director, who handles buying wine for the restaurant and shop, and Jean-Emmanuel Simond, a wine importer and consultant in Paris, whom Mr. Zabar credits with a pivotal role in developing his taste. Every autumn since 2002, Mr. Zabar has traveled to Burgundy and the Piedmont with Mr. Simond, visiting producers and tasting obsessively. A longtime pilot, he flies his own jet, a Cessna Citation CJ4, to Europe and then meets up with a small group that currently includes Mr. Simond; Mr. Restiano; Dan Feldman, the sales director at the importer Skurnik Wines; and Johanne Killeen, a chef and owner at Al Forno in Providence, R.I., whom Mr. Zabar calls ""my wine wife."" He also tries to visit a new wine region each year with Mr. Simond. ""Eli is now being perceived by most top producers we visit not just as a collector, but as someone genuinely passionate, curious to learn every detail about their work and also their lives,"" Mr. Simond wrote in an email. ""And as someone who is doing something that very few people are still trying to achieve today in the wine world, aging the wines in his cellar for sometimes more than a decade before releasing them."" Aging wine properly is an obsession for Mr. Zabar. It's one of the reasons he stocks few grand cru Burgundies in his shop, because they need too much time. ""I want to sell village wines,"" he said. ""Others need time, and most people aren't going to age them."" The grand crus remain in his cellar until he feels they are ready for his restaurant list, often to be snapped up by the Burgundy lovers who monitor his offerings. Mr. Zabar came by his obsession with Burgundy in the early 1970s, when he owned a sandwich shop on Nantucket. After a summer season, he took a trip to France, with visits set up by a family friend, Michael Aaron, the proprietor at the time of the Sherry-Lehmann wine shop. He stopped in to see Louis Latour, the head of a venerable negociant house, who took him to a restaurant, Mr. Zabar recalled, redolent of truffles and veal stock.

""I've always responded to smells,"" he said. ""I thought, 'This is the only place I want to be.'"" And so it was with the wine. ""I found Burgundy so difficult, so curious,"" he said, ""and I loved the smells."" ""I think margins on wine should be reasonable,"" Mr. Zabar said. ""We'll make the money on the food we sell."" Alex Welsh for The New York Times Back in New York, he worked part time at Morrell & Company, a wine shop where another employee introduced him to his personal collection of grand cru Burgundies and impressed upon him the importance of proper aging. Mr. Zabar began to acquire a lot of wine but said he didn't start buying in earnest until 2002, when he opened the store and knew that he eventually wanted to open a restaurant. He buys directly from importers, and never from auctions.","The famed food retailer collects and sells Burgundy — his way, as always.",176fae91-8873-5d81-beba-ed35616a81c6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/16/dining/16POUR1/16POUR1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=f3e4c0993f948da2082d5a52617c79a0d2073aa9dbbae68a6b9ccea16e40f183&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Eli Zabar's markets and takeout shops dominate the Upper East Side.,176fae91-8873-5d81-beba-ed35616a81c6,N24News/imgs/176fae91-8873-5d81-beba-ed35616a81c6.jpg,17
Television,FX Prevails in 'Feud' Defamation Suit Filed by Olivia de Havilland,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/27/arts/television/olivia-de-havilland-feud-fx-lawsuit-thrown-out.html,"In a closely watched legal battle with the potential for far-reaching consequences in the film and television industry, a California appellate court on Monday dismissed a defamation lawsuit brought by the 101-year-old actress Dame Olivia de Havilland against FX Networks.

Ms. de Havilland had objected to her portrayal in the Ryan Murphy-produced 2017 docuseries, ""Feud: Bette and Joan,"" about the volatile relationship shared by Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. She is played by Catherine Zeta-Jones. Her lawsuit, filed last June, was on multiple fronts, including that she did not consent to the use of her likeness in the show and that her portrayal is inaccurate, especially a scene where she is shown referring to her sister, Joan Fontaine, as a ""bitch.""

""Books, films, plays and television shows often portray real people,"" the court decision reads. ""Some are famous and some are just ordinary folks. Whether a person portrayed in one of these expressive works is a world-renowned film star -- 'a living legend' -- or a person no one knows, she or he does not own history.""

FX tried to have the lawsuit tossed last summer, on the grounds of California's anti-Slapp (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, designed to quickly set aside lawsuits that may be designed to chill free speech. But a trial judge surprised legal observers by ruling that Ms. de Havilland had sufficient grounds to proceed with her lawsuit.","A California appellate court tossed a suit filed by Dame Olivia de Havilland objecting to her portrayal in FX's ""Feud: Bette and Joan.""",e513cd9f-e676-5b79-896c-dec3b50a876b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/28/arts/28olivia-item/28olivia-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=95c934f1f673fc109397f151d11882a9428908b933ce91c09f896f9e526168e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Olivia de Havilland, in 2016.

More than 40 paintings will be on display, most of them by artists born or trained in Italy, like Bernardo Bellotto, who painted the Kreuzkirche in Dresden both before and after it was heavily damaged by cannon fire in the Seven Years' War. Other works illustrated public spectacles and formal events across Europe, in Warsaw, Paris, Madrid and Rome.

Art & Design,Art Basel Cancels Hong Kong Fair,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/arts/design/art-basel-cancels-hong-kong-fair.html,"This year's edition of Art Basel Hong Kong, one of the most important destinations in the international art market calendar, has been canceled, with organizers citing the ''sudden and widespread outbreak'' of the coronavirus in China. The fair, held at the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center, and featuring premier galleries from Asia and beyond, was to run March 17 through March 21.

""The decision to cancel Art Basel Hong Kong was an extremely difficult one for us,"" said Bernd Stadlwieser, chief executive of MCH Group, the Swiss-based company behind the fair. ""We explored every other possible option, including postponing the fair, and gathered advice and perspectives from many gallerists, partners, and external experts.

MCH cited numerous factors including the health and safety of fair workers and visitors, the logistical challenges of mounting the event, and the escalating difficulties of travel to Hong Kong, which reported its first fatality from the virus on Feb. 3.

Health,How Healthy Are You? G.O.P. Bill Would Help Employers Find Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/health/workplace-wellness-programs-health-genetic-data.html,"""We strongly oppose any legislation that would allow employers to inquire about employees' private genetic information or medical information unrelated to their ability to do their jobs, and to impose draconian penalties on employees who choose to keep that information private,"" a group of advocates, including AARP, the American Diabetes Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Epilepsy Foundation, the March of Dimes and others wrote in a letter this week to Ms. Foxx.

As wellness programs proliferate across the corporate landscape, workers are increasingly being asked by their companies to undergo health screenings and medical assessments. Employees can opt out of these programs, and personal information specific to a worker is not supposed to be shared directly with the company. The prohibition is aimed at preventing someone from being fired or otherwise discriminated against because of a serious medical condition.

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has vigorously pursued legal action against some employers it claimed went too far and used these programs inappropriately, but the courts have largely been sympathetic to the employers' arguments. Companies also complained that the regulations were confusing, and the commission issued final rules in May aimed at addressing some of their concerns.

Companies defend the wellness programs, saying they keep workers healthier and help reduce insurance costs. But some studies have questioned the effectiveness of these initiatives.

Critics argue that workers are essentially being coerced into giving up private medical information, such as their weight, their blood pressure and whether they are at particular risk for cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers can entice a worker by offering as much as a 30 percent reduction in insurance payments.

Television,"'Star Trek: Discovery' Season 2, Episode 9: Angry, Illogical Spock",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/14/arts/television/star-trek-discovery-recap.html,"""I refuse to take this posturing seriously,"" Burnham says to Spock at the midway point of this week's episode. ""It's entirely out of character."" She might as well have been speaking for the audience at that point because the writers for ""Star Trek: Discovery"" have penned a version of the ""Star Trek"" franchise's most famous Vulcan as one that is totally unfamiliar to Trek audience: Ethan Peck's Spock is someone who is perpetually angry, rude and quick to cruelty. Every sentence he speaks drips with disdain for those around him, particularly for his sister, Burnham. Instead of the endearing Vulcan curiosity Spock personified in previous iterations, we have tantrums now. He chalks it up to the angry emotions he feels about being connected to the Red Angel and the lack of answers he has about its existence. O.K., sure. But he has an entire ship trying to help him solve the mystery. The logical thing would be for him to, you know, chill out. The central point of Peck's portrayal seems to be that as a young man in his early days of Starfleet, Spock was way more tapped into his human side -- hence, the emotional outbursts. But as Kirk, McCoy and the other Enterprise crew members show Spock often, being human is about more than anger, and I find it hard to believe that even a younger version of Spock would let himself get like this, even under extreme duress.

The real highlight of this episode is Hannah Cheesman's performance as Airiam. We learn that she is augmented, a term she uses, which seems to mean cybernetic -- a result of some terrible shuttle accident in her past. A quick note here: In Season 1 of ""Discovery,"" Airiam was played by Sara Mitich, who now plays Nilsson. ""Project Daedalus"" is the rare episode focused on a peripheral character in ""Discovery,"" and Cheesman absolutely delivers. She perfectly conveys, as best as a cybernetic life-form can, her affection for friends like Tilly. And in typical ""Discovery"" fashion, she dies a horrifying death at the end of the episode. The writers deliver a lot of information about Airiam in one episode, enough that I did get attached to the character and was sad to see her die. One problem: The ""Discovery"" writers have too often played with the emotions of their audience by killing off characters and bringing them back. Georgiou, Tyler and Culber are the prominent examples. This season, Saru was on his deathbed. So when Airiam was blasted out into space in order to save the Discovery, whatever emotion I felt from Cheesman's performance quickly dissipated. We've been here before. I bet Airiam comes back in some way, shape or form. And if she doesn't, the writers did a disservice to her character with all the previous false alarms, limiting the impact of this one. Airiam's death scene didn't quite make sense to me either. When Airiam was beseeching Burnham to open the airlock, why didn't Pike beam over a couple crew members to assist Burnham in rescuing Airiam? And why not just beam Airiam to the Discovery once she was ejected into space? I understand that Airiam was not in charge of her body at that point, but at least beam her to the brig and give her a chance.

As for the main plot of the episode -- in which the crew of the Discovery attempts to infiltrate Section 31 headquarters -- the fight scenes featuring a possessed Airiam taking on Burnham and Nhan were exquisite, and a credit to the Trek veteran Jonathan Frakes, who directed the episode. We learn that this is the point in Trek lore when Section 31 begins to turn rogue. The higher-ups in charge of the group haven't responded to Cornwell in weeks, and their threat assessment system (something called Control) has locked her out. Cornwell comes to the Discovery secretly to inform Pike that a fellow admiral, a Vulcan who happens to be a logic extremist, has lobbied for all Starfleet decision-making to be turned over to Control. Leaving out how a Starfleet admiral is able to go anywhere by herself without being tracked, Cornwell's role here is a bit confusing, given that she seemed totally onboard with Section 31 earlier this season and never mentioned the logic extremist. Section 31 has framed Spock for the murders that Starfleet has accused him of, having created fake holographic images that depict the violence. But the endgame is unclear here. The Discovery crew seems to have deduced that Section 31 wants the knowledge of the probe that came back from the future. That would give the group a permanently unbeatable tactical advantage. This is the Section 31 that made for such a compelling story line on ""Deep Space 9"": out-of-control, with its own agenda. This was an uneven episode, but Cheesman was the strong point. It would have been nice to have spent more time with her over the course of the season -- although I suspect we will be able to again. One note: What happened to Tig Notaro's character? Her ingenuity would serve the Discovery really well in some of these moments. And I'd love to see her deal with Cranky Spock.","This episode of ""Star Trek: Discovery"" features a Spock that even Burnham admits is ""entirely out of character.""

Technology,2 Plead Guilty in 2016 Uber and Lynda.com Hacks,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/technology/uber-lyndacom-hacks-guilty-plea.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Two men pleaded guilty in federal court in San Jose, Calif., to charges of computer hacking and an extortion conspiracy on Wednesday, capping a thorny legal saga that ensnared tech companies like Uber and LinkedIn in data breach scandals. The resolution of the case comes as Americans grapple with theft and misuse of their personal information amid serious data breaches at companies from Facebook and Equifax to Target and Marriott over the past decade. Lynda.com, which is owned by LinkedIn, disclosed to its users in December 2016 that it had a data breach. Officials said some 55,000 accounts were affected, and the company warned another 9.5 million customers about the breach. 

On Wednesday, Brandon Glover, a 26-year-old Florida resident, and Vasile Mereacre, a 23-year-old Canadian national, appeared before Judge Lucy Koh of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. In their plea agreements, the men said that they gained access in 2016 to the private databases of Uber and Lynda.com. They said they were able to enter by using the credentials of the Amazon Web Services accounts belonging to Uber and Lynda.com employees, which the hackers stole by using an elaborate ruse to break into those employees' GitHub accounts. The men searched the GitHub accounts for AWS credentials, stole them and then used the credentials to gain access to the Amazon servers that stored data for those companies. The men said that they then downloaded private customer information, anonymously contacted security officials at the companies and tried to extort them for hundreds of thousands of dollars in bitcoin. In 2016, Mr. Glover and Mr. Mereacre, using pseudonyms and untraceable accounts, contacted security officials at Lynda.com and asked for payment in exchange for the data. Instead, Lynda.com security officials disclosed the leak to customers; the hackers stopped communicating with the company. Uber took a different approach. According to court filings, the hackers anonymously contacted Uber's security team in November 2016 and said they had downloaded the account information for 57 million Uber customers. The hackers demanded a six-figure payout to delete the data. Uber officials tried to reach a deal with the hackers by paying them through a ""bug bounty"" website, according to court filings. Technology companies commonly pay bounties to scrupulous hackers to find security vulnerabilities in their systems. But in this case, Uber sent Mr. Glover and Mr. Mereacre two payments of $50,000 in bitcoin and asked them to sign nondisclosure agreements.

""Companies like Uber are the caretakers, not the owners, of customers' personal information,"" David L. Anderson, United States attorney for the Northern District of California, said in a statement. All 50 states and United States territories have enacted laws that require companies to immediately notify customers of unauthorized data breaches that compromise users' personal information. ""Don't be so concerned with your image or reputation ,"" Mr. Anderson said of companies that might try to keep data breaches secret. ""Be concerned with the real losses others have suffered. Report the intrusion promptly. Cooperate with law enforcement."" Uber executives revealed the data breach in late 2017. The ride-hailing company ousted Joe Sullivan, the chief security officer who presided over the payments, for arranging the deal and not alerting the public . Uber later settled a nationwide investigation of the breach and the company's behavior surrounding the incident for $148 million. Mr. Sullivan and Travis Kalanick, Uber's former chief executive who oversaw the payments, claimed at the time that the security team treated the incident like an authorized disclosure as part of Uber's ""bug bounty"" program. Uber's security team used data uncovered during the payment negotiation to find Mr. Glover at his home in Florida, according to the filings. In January 2017, members of Uber's security team showed up in Florida and Canada to find both men and make them sign confidentiality agreements. ""In order to take on those people on the front lines of the cyber security battle, we rely heavily on our valued relationships and open dialogue with private sector companies in cyber industries,"" said John Bennett, Federal Bureau of Investigation special agent in charge, who worked on the case. ""Their willingness to speedily report intrusions to our investigators allows us to find and arrest those who commit data breaches.""",Guilty pleas to charges of hacking and an extortion conspiracy cap a legal saga that ensnared the tech companies in data breach scandals.,181f9b4a-299b-5517-a5a4-2da1bd11f749,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/30/business/30hackers/30hackers-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=48280dbb123b6a273acd1b07678f6160e1cc0129be75dbcbcb93080af37cba9e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Uber breach affected more than 57 million people, as the hackers gained access to the names, phone numbers and email addresses of riders and drivers who used the service.",181f9b4a-299b-5517-a5a4-2da1bd11f749,N24News/imgs/181f9b4a-299b-5517-a5a4-2da1bd11f749.jpg,20
Movies,"'Chinese Portrait' Review: A Snapshot of a Country, Artfully Composed",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/chinese-portrait-review.html,"In its title and its panoramic scope, ""Chinese Portrait"" promises a snapshot of modern China, with scenes that show life in settings urban and rural, industrial and agrarian, scenic and seedy. This documentary's human subjects are young and old. But in intriguing, sometimes unsatisfying ways, it leaves the synthesis to the viewer. It is an experimental film more than it is a state-of-the-nation address, inviting consideration of how each of its successive tableaus -- just about the entirety of the movie -- came to be created.

The director, the veteran Chinese filmmaker Wang Xiaoshuai (""Beijing Bicycle""), shot ""Chinese Portrait"" over a decade on a combination of film and video. Many scenes consist of a single shot, and the vignettes are generally separated by brief bits of visible film leader. The pieces of dialogue that can be heard go unsubtitled. And while the film depicts a diverse cross-section of Chinese life -- from horses grazing in the countryside to a man in a respiratory mask in a smoggy cityscape; from Muslims in prayer to a dimly lit celebration -- its primary interest lies in the tension between candid moments and shots that appear artfully composed.

The documentary begins with miners standing by a track at what looks like the opening of a mine shaft. (There are no title cards or other identifiers.) Are the miners' stoic stances natural or acted? What conversations, with the filmmakers or otherwise, took place before and after the cameras rolled? In several shots -- in an office, in a classroom -- one person will stare directly at Wang's camera while others appear oblivious to it. Other images are straightforward person-on-the-street portraits, practically still photographs. The camera is notable for its stillness. Kineticism generally derives from action within a shot: A man stands by a gate at the back of a speeding train while another train rushes by in the opposite direction. A building undergoing demolition partly collapses, stirring up a giant cloud of dust.","A visual take on the vast expanse of a land and its people, compiled over 10 years by Wang Xiaoshuai.",a2edd83b-0b4e-5803-9a7b-492a9eea8ab5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/arts/12chinese-portraitpix/12chinese-portraitpix-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=bfcd42dfce95655b5b734bc02ede000bad9db9a9525772e252e6fd155538d4f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A scene from &ldquo;Chinese Portrait.&rdquo;,a2edd83b-0b4e-5803-9a7b-492a9eea8ab5,N24News/imgs/a2edd83b-0b4e-5803-9a7b-492a9eea8ab5.jpg,5

Movies,Lynn Shelton on Overcoming Her Darkest Moment on Set,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/movies/lynn-shelton-interview.html,"I had asked her for a favor for a book I'm working on, ""How I Got Through It,"" interviews about self-care for creative types, and as always Lynn was eager to contribute. She called me from the home of her romantic and creative partner, Marc Maron, and we talked for nearly two hours. As befitted our friendship, she was open, unguarded, self-effacing and thoughtful as she discussed one of the hardest times in her life, when she was shooting her Sundance sensation ""Your Sister's Sister."" Though she spoke about turning to therapy for other situations and getting more sleep as well, in this edited excerpt from our conversation, she talked about what happened and how she ultimately turned to meditation.

What was the toughest time, or one of the toughest times, of your adult life? There was this period, I don't remember when it started, but it really hit hard right before, and in the middle of, shooting a film. When I woke up to it and thought, Oh, this is a real thing. ""Your Sister's Sister"" was my third feature. And when I was filming those [first] two films, I had never been happier in my entire life. I felt like my whole being was lit on fire. I was so happy. And I was surrounded by people I loved; I was collaborating with them. I couldn't wait to get on set again because I was just so high there. [""Your Sister's Sister"" was filming] in one of the most beautiful places on earth [the San Juan Islands, in Washington]. We'd been able to lock down this perfect compound. We were all able to sleep and live on the same property. We marched every day on foot to the picture house. And we had friends make meals for us. It was this two-week-long beautiful retreat, this perfect little bubble of all my favorite people. Heaven. Right?

And I was just miserable every day. I would only get about four hours' sleep a night. I would wake up in the morning and think, why are we doing this? What's the purpose? What's the point? It was so sad, and nobody knew I was going through it because I was honestly ashamed. Because I knew how privileged I was, and what a beautiful experience this should be. And it was so mysterious. I didn't understand why I was so depressed. I didn't share it with anybody because it was so embarrassing.

How did you deal with the issues that were brought up on set? It took a couple of years. I remember hearing a piece on NPR, a woman doing a testimonial about her experience with postpartum depression. She said, I'm looking at this baby and I understand objectively what I should be feeling. And I felt nothing. That was exactly how I felt about the film in the edit room. Are people going to care about this? I just could not connect to the film. I heard that [NPR] piece, and I was like, Oh my God, I'm going through postpartum depression. I'm feeling the exact same thing. By the time we actually turned it in to festivals, or maybe it wasn't until the festival premiere, it finally hit me. I remember it like a fog lifting. Oh my God, I love my movie. Thank God. Thank God it exists. It felt like it was so hormonal. I addressed my sleep issues and stuff like that. Now I have friends whose lives have been saved by drugs, by antidepressants. But I really wanted to explore every other option first. It just felt like I could probably deal with it in other ways.

What helped you get through it? Meditation is a really important piece. I started by reading every book I could and trying out different practices. At the time there were no apps. But somebody gave me ""Catching the Big Fish"" by David Lynch. I read that book [which discusses Transcendental Meditation] and I remember saying, Oh my God, I want that. He talks about how it affects his creativity, and I was really interested in that, too. I've always been interested in different states of consciousness, and I yearned to be in this other place that he described.

After directing ""Laggies,"" a studio film that brought her first decent paycheck, she tried Transcendental Meditation. The very first time, I felt like I was on some sort of hallucinogenic drug trip. I got so high. It's funny because I say high and deep at the same time, but it's like flying in a deep way. I don't even know how to explain it. It was so different than anything I'd ever experienced in any other form of meditation. That was it; I was hooked. Shelton went on to practice twice daily for 20 minutes at a time, anywhere she could find a spot, even in a set trailer or a parked car. And what does that time do for you? It's like this gigantic reset button. It's like getting high twice a day with nothing but great side effects, no hangover. I will say it changes. Sometimes if I'm really stressed out and there's a lot going on in my brain, I'll go through the monkey mind thing, and I'll gently have to return to the mantra. I'm a pretty high-strung person, or I was. On the first shooting day, there's fires to put out. It can get very stressful. And then you get that reset button. You're just like, OK, I'm ready for the next part of the day.

Shelton went on to describe how meditating had changed her. With my first feature film, I remember we were losing a location and we were going to have one less day [and were also] running out of film or something. We had a whole two more scenes to get through. So I had to snap into -- it was a fight-or-flight kind of thing. My adrenaline went way up, my cortisol level went way up, and I was able to cut out about three quarters of the coverage I was going to get, and figure out how to address this issue. But then I couldn't return to a normal state again. I couldn't come back down. And my second A.D. [assistant director] had to take me for a walk and be like, Lynn, pull it together. You're OK. Everything's cool. And I had to really work hard to go back down to base level. Having now meditated for a number of years, I can do that. I can appropriately respond to that situation, but then I can reset and be OK. [When] my depression peaked during the production and editing phase of ""Your Sister's Sister,"" I developed an eating disorder. I became a compulsive eater, just out of control, like what the hell is going on? I had this idea that [meditation] was going to be a magic bullet. It's going to solve my depression, it's going to solve my eating disorder. I'm going to be a perfect person. Well obviously, that did not happen, but it still was a life changer. It really helped on every level of dealing with stress, with toxic work situations, with addictive behaviors, with all kinds of self-acceptance and self-forgiveness. When I go back and remember specific circumstances or experiences five years ago compared to now, it's like, Oh yeah, I'm a different person.

Books,Is Math Too Tidy to Be Useful?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/15/books/review/counting-deborah-stone.html,"COUNTING

How We Use Numbers to Decide What Matters

By 

The title of ""Counting"" contains some revealing wordplay: To count is to tally things up but, also, to count is to matter. In this book, the political scientist  explores the ways in which these two meanings of ""count"" are intertwined in society. She argues that our judgments are embedded in the way we count because of the decisions we make about what matters, and that we then use this to make concrete judgments that we claim are based on math when really they're a result of our preconceived notions.

It is a curious experience to agree with the conclusion of a book but not its argument. Stone's broad message is that we shouldn't regard numbers as reflecting absolute truths about the world without first considering the methods used to produce those numbers. She offers many devastating examples, including how different interpretations of the safe amount of lead in water proved deadly in the Flint water disaster, the way teachers are now assessed based on a ""value added"" measurement of their worth and the egregious evaluation of the life of a slave in the Constitution, rated at three-fifths of a person. Stone shows how being in thrall to numbers is misguided and dangerous, that they can often hide injustice and that we should examine and question the mechanisms through which we arrive at figures and statistics that we consider to be authoritative.

Stone's critique is ultimately that life, unlike math, is full of ambiguity and messiness and multiple interpretation, and this should make us wary of the ways numbers can be manipulated toward various ends. But I take issue with the way she characterizes math, and this is where I disagree with her analysis, and I do so as a mathematician who sees the power of numbers and also their limitations.

Math itself is not really about clear-cut answers either: Rather, it gives us precise and well-defined steps for investigating nuance. Stone thinks we should rely on math less to solve our problems in life; I think we should use it more, but with a more careful understanding of what math is and how it works.","In ""Counting,"" Deborah Stone argues that we shouldn't put too much stock in numbers as a way to understand our lives.",44fc8697-b2f1-5af7-9194-412ff37fcb19,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/26/books/review/Cheng1/Cheng1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1164e32135e40c33b047d35c5991c846de8189db7d2e63e74ed7a1a67fa53cbb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Deborah Stone,44fc8697-b2f1-5af7-9194-412ff37fcb19,N24News/imgs/44fc8697-b2f1-5af7-9194-412ff37fcb19.jpg,13
Economy,"Two Economies in Turmoil, for Different Reasons",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/business/economy/two-economies-in-turmoil-for-different-reasons.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, meant to deliver two dollops of good news on Wednesday: the economy is doing better, and the Fed is determined to keep it that way. He announced that the Fed would extend one part of its stimulus campaign, suggested that it might extend another part, and offered new details about the timing. Yet his primary audience, the investors whose decisions spread Fed policy through the economy, responded as if the news had been grim. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index took its worst two-day dive since November 2011 and has lost 5 percent of its value in the last month. Wells Fargo, the nation's largest mortgage lender, raised its advertised rate on 30-year loans to 4.5 percent from 3.9 percent in the same period. The call-and-response underscores the complexity of the Fed's task as it seeks to do more to help the economy, but not too much.

Fed officials increasingly are convinced that they are finally doing enough to stimulate the economy -- not just the steps already taken, but the plans they have detailed for the next several years. That is why they felt comfortable suggesting that they could begin before the end of the year to scale back their purchases of government securities. But some critics see clear evidence in the persistence of high unemployment and low inflation that the Fed should do even more. And many others are simply nervous.

""People aren't sure that the economy is well enough for the Fed to pull back,"" said Paul Christopher, chief international strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. ""The market is signaling to the Fed that we don't trust your assessment of the economy; we don't trust your assessment of inflation."" On Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke sought to underscore that the Fed still planned to stimulate the economy on a big scale over the next few years. The central bank continues to hold short-term interest rates near zero, and Mr. Bernanke said it might maintain that policy for longer than previously expected. The Fed has amassed more than $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities, and Mr. Bernanke said that it no longer intended to sell the mortgage bonds as the economy improved. Yet public attention focused almost entirely on the least potent part of the Fed's stimulus effort, its pledge to expand its holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasuries to increase job growth. Those purchases will continue for now, but Mr. Bernanke for the first time sketched a timeline for winding them down, beginning this year and ending next summer, as long as growth keeps pace with the Fed's expectations. Specifically, he said that the Fed expected the unemployment rate to decline to 7 percent by next summer, from 7.6 percent in May.

This was a good demonstration of the difference between probably and certainly. While the timeline generally corresponded to investors' expectations, Mr. Bernanke's remarks made it official. And his repeated insistence that investors should focus instead on the evolution of economic data worked about as well as telling people not to think about purple kangaroos. ""If you draw the conclusion that I've just said that our policies, that our purchases will end in the middle of next year, you've drawn the wrong conclusion, because our purchases are tied to what happens in the economy,"" Mr. Bernanke said in one response to a question at a news conference on Wednesday. Some analysts and economists said the reaction was particularly striking because the Fed seemed more committed than ever to its stimulus campaign. ""They are getting very close to where I would have had them be two or three years ago,"" said Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Fed economist and architect of the first round of asset purchases who is now a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""I find it odd, and probably the chairman is surprised and unhappy with the market reaction, too."" The Fed declined on Thursday to comment on the market reaction to Mr. Bernanke's remarks. But he expressed himself clearly during the news conference on the negative market response since his last public appearance in May. ""Well, we were a little puzzled by that,"" he said.

He also acknowledged that the Fed might need to respond if the market's reaction persisted. ""It's important to understand that our policies are economic-dependent,"" he said. ""And in particular, if financial conditions move in a way that makes this economic scenario unlikely, for example, then that would be a reason for us to adjust our policy."" Some analysts said that would not be necessary, arguing that the market would soon settle down. Others, however, saw legitimate reasons for concern. The Fed has made the unemployment rate the measuring stick for its stimulus effort. It doubled down on Wednesday by saying that it would buy bonds until the rate fell to 7 percent. But the unemployment rate so far has fallen almost entirely because people have stopped looking for work. The share of adults with jobs, known as the employment-to-population ratio, has barely changed over the last three years. In past recoveries, declining unemployment has encouraged people to re-enter the labor market, but some economists argue that that will not begin to happen until the rate falls well below 7 percent. ""Why is monetary policy linked to unemployment rate as opposed to employment-to-population ratio?"" Amir Sufi, an economist at the University of Chicago, wrote on Twitter. ""Seems bonkers. Does anyone seriously think labor market is improving dramatically?"" Jan Hatzius, chief economist at Goldman Sachs, wrote in an e-mail that he doubted the Fed's current plans would be sufficient. ""I am much less sanguine under our forecasts for the economy,"" he wrote, ""and to a somewhat lesser degree even under theirs.""","Fed officials are convinced they have done enough stimulus, but some critics see evidence in the persistence of high unemployment and low inflation that the Fed should do even more.",bdc97043-971a-5718-8845-8c43a91b1bc0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/21/business/FED3/FED3-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=477&w=600&s=11e16ec8f20b661f6c2cffaac57b10ab0a7902fcb3462b71560596a7d2400f43&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A trader on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange at the closing bell.,bdc97043-971a-5718-8845-8c43a91b1bc0,N24News/imgs/bdc97043-971a-5718-8845-8c43a91b1bc0.jpg,8
Automobiles,"Detroit Love, Swedish Style",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/03/automobiles/detroit-love-swedish-style.html,"VASTERAS, SWEDEN -- It was the evening of July 3, and a phalanx of American steel was arriving in this town an hour or so northwest of Stockholm. Pontiacs, Fords, Plymouths, Cadillacs, Chevrolets -- pretty much every brand of car ever manufactured on American soil -- bumper to bumper into the fading daylight. Most were pristine, with immaculate chrome and gleaming paint, but some were custom hot rods in candy colors, and a few were wrecks that looked as if they had just been pulled from the ocean floor. All were headed to the Power Big Meet 2014, which the organizers say is the world's largest classic-car gathering. This was the 30th anniversary of the meet in its current incarnation -- first held in 1978 and moved here in 1984 -- and as many as 15,000 vehicles were expected to fill the festival grounds. Disciples of Detroit engineering had driven from all over Europe to gawk at one another's cars. It is hard to overstate how much the Swedes love old American cars. Swedish enthusiasts will happily boast that there is more classic Detroit iron in Sweden than in the United States. The Swedish fascination for Detroit slipped over into full-blown obsession a long time ago.

Thousands of vintage cars are imported into the country each year, participants here say, in part to satisfy the demand of the Swedish raggare subculture, which is populated by gearheads who have combined the fashion sensibilities of John Travolta in ""Grease"" with the drinking habits of a Lynyrd Skynyrd concertgoer. A scan of the crowd confirms that the raggare is as ingrained in the Swedish soul as Ikea and Abba. ""Kjell, how the hell are you going to fit that thing in there?"" Oskar Antonson shouted to Kjell (Shell) Svenningsson, a friend who was trying with various degrees of violence to fit a Volvo generator under the hood of his 1957 Pontiac Bonneville. The car had ground to a halt in the muddy roads of a campground. Power Big Meet has two official campgrounds. One has pristine lawns, showers, toilets and most important, no tendency to transform into an ocean of mud at the slightest drizzle; the other, the much more popular Swine Camp, is no doubt named for the grooming standards of the people who choose to stay there. Ignoring the advice, Mr. Svenningsson grabbed a hacksaw and amputated an egg-size chunk of steel from the generator. He shoved the modified piece into place and cranked the starter. The generator rattled, but obeyed. Kjell slammed the hood. ""The car lives in Europe now, so she better get used to European parts,"" he said. The campgrounds neatly illustrate the two cultures of the Swedish Am-car scene. The nice camp has shiny, beautifully restored cars. Swine Camp, on the other hand, is the domain of a very Swedish subspecies of the American automobile: the pilsner car.

That is a car that looks as if it has suffered decades of cruel abuse. It is rusted out, covered with stickers and grime, its roof, trunk and hood beaten and dented almost beyond recognition. And if it is an authentic pilsner, the back end scrapes the ground because the frame has been broken over the rear axle. However, it is in the guts of a pilsner car where things get really strange. Under the hood, a true pilsner will have a new or renovated engine, preferably something powerful like a 351-cubic-inch Ford V8. The axles have fresh brakes, the rust is rarely more than skin-deep, and the broken frame may even be welded solid in its mangled state. The pilsner is a muscle car disguised as a beater. ""It's about being able to not give a damn,"" said Henrik Hjalmarsson, sitting on the hood of his Chevy. Mr. Hjalmarsson owns a particularly defeated-looking pilsner, a 1968 Impala with a 1967 front end and a suitably broken frame. The car was loaded with stickers, many of them Confederate flags. The raggare culture has a deep fascination with the American South. ""I can spill as much beer and put out as many cigarettes on the seats as I want,"" he said. ""But if you look underneath, the car is like new."" At 9 a.m. Friday, roughly half the campers dragged themselves out of their campers, back seats or tents to go to the festival grounds while the other half took shelter anywhere they could find. Most had spent the night riding around town, perched on the roofs and trunks of their cars, parked at the local gas station and drinking Swedish moonshine from gallon jugs. This town is quiet for most of the year, but explodes during Power Big Meet. Some businesses use it as an opportunity to crank up the prices of food and drinks, while most locals are happy to take in the spectacle from their lawn chairs. As roughly 10,000 cars filed in -- fewer than the organizers had anticipated but still filling the festival grounds -- many owners spent the first few hours sleeping on the grass next to their cars. Vendors along a main road sold classic hubcaps, license plates and various knickknacks whose value seemed to stem only from the fact that they were American. Bleachers had been set up, and cars entered in the various categories filed past.

Steven Gjaerud, 19, had a 1968 Dodge Coronet body mounted on a 2007 Charger chassis. Mika Droddy has spent most of a year sticking the body of a 1959 Plymouth to the frame of a '79 Ford Bronco. But most of the cars were not abominations. In any direction and you might see something beautiful, like a 1966 Pontiac Bonneville, a 1938 Ford Deluxe, a 1965 Sting Ray or one of the 200-some Mustangs sprinkled around the grounds. Cherielynn Westrich, famous from her appearances on Discovery's ""Overhaulin' "" show, where she restores cars with Chip Foose, had finally been talked into coming to Power Big Meet after hearing her friends rave about it for years. ""Sweden is the 53rd state,"" Ms. Westrich said. ""And Power Big Meet is the biggest and baddest car show in the world."" The next day, the festival was winding down. Some partiers headed home, but most were gearing up for a final night of Big Meet celebrations. ""This place is unique,"" Al Young, a former drag racing champion, said after receiving the award for longest distance traveled, having shipped his 1973 Plymouth Road Runner from Seattle to the Netherlands. ""The Swedes are crazy about their cars, and I love the pilsner cars,"" he said. ""In the U.S., classic cars are for old guys who can afford to restore them, but these beaters allow kids to get into restoring cars.""","The Power Big Meet car gathering in Sweden has been held for decades and is a love fest for old American cars, some in pristine condition and others that are more rust than bucket.",02b68d55-2300-5f38-8236-39f94a1c66ba,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/08/03/automobiles/SWEDES1/SWEDES1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=343&w=600&s=b8983aca0679761481dd9239472ac963311e4cd0da660db3f3af5d3259e3d958&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Celebrating Power Big Meet 2014 on a ""pilsner"" 1960s Chevrolet",02b68d55-2300-5f38-8236-39f94a1c66ba,N24News/imgs/02b68d55-2300-5f38-8236-39f94a1c66ba.jpg,23

Real Estate,"Developers Migrate to Areas Near the G, J, M and Z Trains",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/26/realestate/developers-migrate-to-areas-near-the-g-j-m-and-z-trains.html,"The impending 15-month shutdown of the L train, which will heavily affect residents in Williamsburg when it begins in April 2019, has prompted many developers to scout properties along the G train in Greenpoint and the J, M and Z lines in South Williamsburg. ""There were already a lot of natural drivers pushing people into Greenpoint, but the L train shutdown has meant more people paying attention to it,"" said Anthony Morena, who heads up the architecture and development firm Mortar. ""We've had buyers who were looking strictly at Williamsburg who have started looking at other options.""

Mortar has recently secured three development sites on the path of the G where it plans to build 10- to 20-unit projects -- one on Frost Street in Northern Williamsburg, another on Diamond Street in Greenpoint, and the third on Eagle Street, also in Greenpoint. Mr. Morena added that sites along the G -- once plentiful and well priced compared with L train parcels -- have become more difficult to acquire.

At the Gibraltar, a new condo under construction at 160 West Street in Greenpoint, some units have sold for upward of $1,500 per square foot, rather than the $1,000 per square foot older inventory commands. Bryan Atienza, a salesman at Nest Seekers International handling sales there, pointed out that G train-adjacent projects fetching L train-level prices were an enticing prospect for developers squeamish about bringing properties to market in the midst of the shutdown. Jonathan Miller, the chief executive of Miller Samuel, an appraisal firm, noted that a shutdown of a year and a half ""is a window, not a permanent structural change,"" and as such wasn't likely to generate buildings in competing transportation areas that would not have been created eventually. ""But it does move the timetable up,"" he said.

Although the G train has long been denigrated as poky and subpar -- it's the only major line that doesn't go to Manhattan -- improved service, along with overcrowded L trains, the growing popularity of alternatives like Citi Bike and Uber, as well as the rising number of people who work from home, has made living along it increasingly appealing, according to Chris Cavorti, an associate broker with the Corcoran Group. ""Greenpoint has always been standing on its own,"" Mr. Cavorti said. ""The shutdown will just push it over the edge into higher price points.""

While demand for properties along the G has been strong for some time, John Horowitz, a regional manager at Marcus & Millichap, a commercial brokerage, said he had seen more investor interest in buildings along the JMZ corridor, ""which was not necessarily a line many people were talking about before."" He added, however, that he didn't anticipate a commensurate decline in L train interest: ""There's a reason it's in more demand than the JMZ, and I don't think two years is long enough to flip that,"" he said. After all, though sales along the L train may suffer in the coming years, the line's status -- and supremacy -- is likely to be restored along with the Canarsie tunnel. And it's worth noting that some of the highest condo sales along the G have been in areas also convenient to the L. Tami Earnest of Bold New York, who is managing sales at 533 Leonard, where a penthouse asking $2.87 million recently went into contract, pointed out that the location was, at the moment, hard to beat. ""It's in this perfect pocket of Greenpoint -- just over the border of Williamsburg, on the other side of McCarren Park, right between the G and the L,"" she said.","To avoid bringing new properties to market near the L train while the line is shut down, developers have been scouting property elsewhere.",99fb6bd0-8600-5afa-a254-6ba8e01a07cf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/28/realestate/0528WILLIAMSBURG3/0528WILLIAMSBURG3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f953b8e748c9776a99f92836ed5b262c3e7ebd300a180e2a1834fb69599bf26c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The J train traverses the Williamsburg Bridge heading into Manhattan from the Marcy Avenue stop in the South Williamsburg neighborhood in Brooklyn.,99fb6bd0-8600-5afa-a254-6ba8e01a07cf,N24News/imgs/99fb6bd0-8600-5afa-a254-6ba8e01a07cf.jpg,7

Hollywood, Dec 1: Xavier Cain, 48, lives in a tent under HWY 101 alongside many other unhoused people.

The coronavirus has infected over a million people around the world. As the pandemic sweeps across the country, tens of thousands of people are living on the streets of California. Last month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California warned that as many as 60,000 homeless people could be infected with Covid-19, overwhelming the state's health care systems. In Los Angeles County, where roughly 60,000 people are homeless, there are at least nine confirmed cases of coronavirus among unsheltered people. Shelters are nearly full, and the places where many can find food, shelter and a bathroom, like libraries, gyms, and soup kitchens, are closed. The county has started setting up emergency temporary shelters in city recreation centers, and deployed portable toilets, hand-washing stations and mobile shower services at some encampments. But this will not be enough to stem the spread of the virus.

Organizations like Safe Parking LA and The Shower of Hope provide a safe and stable place to park a vehicle overnight, remain compliant with local laws, and have access to restroom facilities. I grew up in Geneva, Ill., a small suburb outside of Chicago. In 2012, I moved to Venice, Calif., to intern with a photographer that was working on a project on wealth inequality. Before I moved to L.A. I had never seen so many homeless people. On the Venice boardwalk near my apartment, there were people living in tents or in makeshift shelters. I began to approach them and talk to them about their lives. Eventually I began bringing my camera and recorder along.

For the homeless, something as essential as finding a clean bathroom can be a challenge. I first met David Busch in 2013, when he was petitioning the city of Los Angeles to keep the bathrooms on the boardwalk clean and accessible. He wore a small cardboard sign hung around his neck with the words ""More Love"" written in black marker. We talked about dissolving the stereotypes that exist around the homeless, and finding that human connection that binds us all. In December 2019, I ran into Mr. Busch on Venice's ""Skid Rose,"" just down the street from Google's office in Venice. He was giving the leaders of the Care Program, which provides sanitation and hygiene services to the homeless, a tour of the encampments in the area and advising them on how to best connect with the community. ""A big thing we are seeing is encampment scattering, where the city literally picks up people's tents and throws them away in order to 'clean up' the mess,"" he told me.

This critical moment is an opportunity for us to do better. Forcing people from place to place and into shelters are not viable long-term solutions. Under normal circumstances it provides no protection from catching a sickness let alone a virus. The government must create more affordable housing, and it's up to us to hold their feet to the fire. If we start now, maybe we can protect our unhoused neighbors in the first place instead of scrambling at the last minute.

Dance,"Review: On the High Line, Striking Poses in Latex and Lipstick",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/27/arts/dance/review-alexandra-bachzetsis-high-line.html,"A latex dress. A man's suit. A thick coat of red lipstick. In ""PRIVATE: Wear a mask when you talk to me"" and ""Private Song,"" the choreographer Alexandra Bachzetsis explores the idea of gender with surfaces in mind. If you want to transform into another look -- male or female -- simply wipe yourself clean and start over. And then, always, strike a pose. ""Will you spray me?"" Ms. Bachzetsis asked at the High Line under a covered passageway at 14th Street. Ms. Bachzetsis, a choreographer who works frequently in the visual art world, was wearing a long latex dress; her request involved convincing an audience member to spray her with latex polish to make it shine. It was a provocative hook, but it wasn't enough to reel me in. In ""Wear a mask,"" the solo performed on Monday, audience members took their seats while she touched up her makeup; Grace Jones's ""I've Seen That Face Before"" played. Ms. Bachzetsis, looking a little like Amy Winehouse with cat-wing eyeliner and bouffant raven hair is not the subtle sort.

When, later in the solo, she pulled on a pair of white socks and shiny black shoes, you could sense the moonwalk to come. (And it did, tepidly, to the opening notes of Michael Jackson's ""Beat It."") Throughout her transformations, she appropriated and displaced other dance forms, too, from Greek folk dance to Trisha Brown's masterly ""Set and Reset"" (1983). Such moments were mixed with physical activities, like wrestling and yoga, as well as images featuring a model's empty gaze.

""Wear a mask,"" from 2016, was clearly the source material for ""Private Song,"" a 2017 trio performed on Tuesday by Sotiris Vasiliou, Thibault Lac and Ms. Bachzetsis. But while ""Private Song"" extends Ms. Bachzetsis's vision, it doesn't fully expand it. It reframes elements from her solo and continues a theme that came near the end of ""Wear a mask"": Greek music and dance, specifically the zeibekiko, a dance form usually performed by a man. This was a highlight: Ms. Bachzetsis, wearing a suit and no makeup -- her hair now short -- embodied the ghosts of male bodies with a spooky, mournful air as she stretched her arms from side to side, snapped her fingers and slapped the side of an ankle. In ""Private Song,"" that solo returned, but was shown alongside movement from ""Set and Reset,"" as interpreted by Mr. Lac, whose unflappable presence was grounding throughout. But while he was more successful than Ms. Bachzetsis in approximating Brown's fluid, sinewy swoop, neither could give it a reason for living within this medley of gender and bodily explorations. Also in the work were urban Greek Rebetiko songs, sung mainly by Mr. Lac and Mr. Vasiliou. It certainly didn't hurt that he looked like a model himself, or, for fans of the television show ""Friday Night Lights,"" a Greek version of Tim Riggins.

That was the troubling part: Ms. Bachzetsis's two works rested so heavily on appearance that their images seemed ripped out of a magazine, lending a flatness to her experiment of layering movement and gendered poses to new effect. For the most part, they were displayed like objects on a shelf, frozen in time. A shift came in the final moments as Mr. Lac, not so much performing the zeibekiko as possessing it, crept closer to the audience while kicking his legs in defiance and standing with raised arms. Without warning, he slapped his ankle and stalked off the stage -- all the while, transitioning into another culture (Greek) as if it were a new accessory.","With two pieces performed on the High Line, the choreographer Alexandra Bachzetsis explores gender with surfaces in mind.",ece74ca3-47b0-5749-8dcf-5b9ee7f66092,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/28/arts/28highline-1/28highline-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5551293e5098b840d3b848b01c59954ecf62fef25b6d8f5290b4e15bd5b54711&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The choreographer Alexandra Bachzetsis performing in her piece ""PRIVATE: Wear a mask when you talk to me"" on the High Line.",ece74ca3-47b0-5749-8dcf-5b9ee7f66092,N24News/imgs/ece74ca3-47b0-5749-8dcf-5b9ee7f66092.jpg,6
Economy,Latest Fed Discussion Reflects More Confidence in Raising Rates,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/23/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates-meeting-minutes-yellen.html,"WASHINGTON -- When Federal Reserve officials convened just before the presidential election, they talked like people who were ready to raise interest rates, although they decided to wait a little longer. They fretted about the growing risks of keeping borrowing costs at a historically low level, according to an account of the meeting that the Fed published on Wednesday. They also expressed confidence, albeit with some reservations, that the economy was ready for higher rates. The exuberant reaction of financial markets to Donald J. Trump's victory has strengthened the case for higher rates, and solidified expectations that the Fed will act at its next meeting in December. The early November meeting was something of a placeholder. The Fed was seen as unlikely to move on the eve of the election. Officials had decided they were not quite ready to raise rates at their previous meeting, in September, and the account noted that they did not have much new data to consider.

But the latest meeting's account portrays a sense of growing urgency among the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed committee that sets the course of monetary policy. ""Many judged that risks to economic and financial stability could increase over time if the labor market overheated appreciably, or expressed concern that an extended period of low-interest rates risked intensifying incentives for investors to reach for yield, potentially leading to a mispricing of risk and misallocation of capital,"" it said. The account was published after a standard three-week delay. The Fed said that the case for a rate increase had ""strengthened"" after the November meeting. Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, went a little further last week, telling a congressional committee that an increase in the Fed's benchmark interest rate ""could well become appropriate relatively soon."" The meeting account is in the same key. Two officials voted to raise rates in November, and the minutes said others were already convinced that the Fed should move in December, given its stated objectives. Moreover, the account said, ""Most participants expressed a view that it could well become appropriate to raise the target range for the federal funds rate relatively soon, so long as incoming data provided some further evidence of continued progress toward the committee's objectives.""

Investors are responding in part to Mr. Trump's economic plans. He has promised to collaborate with congressional Republicans on a large tax cut and other measures intended to stimulate economic growth. Fed officials have all but begged for fiscal authorities to take a stronger hand, in part because they are eager to dial back their own efforts, and push rates up toward more normal levels. Yet the markets' reaction to Mr. Trump's victory also creates some new problems. ""The timing and scope of these actions is still highly uncertain,"" said James Marple, senior economist at TD Bank. ""In the meantime, interest- and exchange-rate sensitive sectors of the economy like housing and trade will take a hit, suggesting some downside risk to economic growth."" The Fed has kept its benchmark rate between 0.25 and 0.5 percent since last December. The policy is intended to bolster economic activity by encouraging borrowing and risk-taking, but it has raised concerns that the Fed is encouraging too much borrowing and risk-taking. In addition, Fed officials have concluded that labor market conditions are unlikely to further improve, although the share of adults with jobs is significantly below the prerecession level. The account takes pains to emphasize that the Fed is planning a slow retreat. And it sounded a cautionary note about the strength of growth in the third quarter. The economy expanded at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, but Fed officials pointed to a number of unusual factors, including a boom in soybean exports. ""Excluding these factors, underlying economic growth had been relatively modest,"" the account said. ""Growth of consumer spending had slowed from its brisk pace earlier in the year, residential investment had fallen again, and business fixed investment had remained soft.""",Officials emphasized that the Fed was planning a slow retreat.

Music,Finding a Musical Ideal in the Vermont Woods,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/arts/music/review-marlboro-festival-mitsuko-uchida.html,"MARLBORO, Vt. -- The projectile whizzed past Tessa Lark's ear just as she was trying to put into words what makes the Marlboro Music School and Festival here so special. Ms. Lark, a violinist, was eating dinner last Saturday at a long table crowded with musicians and their families. Later in the evening, she was to perform Brahms's Piano Quintet alongside the pianist Mitsuko Uchida, Marlboro's artistic director.

The pianist Jonathan Biss, noticing my confusion, leaned forward. ""It's so intense here,"" he said, ""and you're playing for hours a day, that behaving like an idiot is an essential release.""

Intensity and freedom may be the defining qualities of Marlboro. (As are the dinnertime paper fights, apparently a tradition.) Since the festival's founding in 1951, this dairy farm turned liberal arts college has become the summer home for a thriving community of musicians who delve into the chamber repertory with a devotion bordering on zeal. Veteran artists and young professionals play side by side and feed off one another's energy and experience. But the most extravagant gift Marlboro offers participants is a commodity that has become only more precious: time.

Chamber groups here have the luxury of rehearsing as long as they need. Public concerts each weekend and a Musicians from Marlboro tour during the regular season represent only a fraction of the works studied each session. Some groups spend the whole summer on a single piece.",The Marlboro Music School and Festival offers participants in its chamber groups a commodity that has become only more precious: time.,4fcf027d-8a3a-5846-b9eb-60a1641de8e7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/25/arts/25marlboro1/25marlboro1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=57b718d98c7a82e0b739c807fca3b02bcf26ac56747eda9bf863948f7b69538b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mitsuko Uchida, second from left, the artistic director of the Marlboro Music Festival, played Brahms with, from left, Tessa Lark, Robyn Bollinger, Peter Stumpf and Zoë Martin-Doike.",4fcf027d-8a3a-5846-b9eb-60a1641de8e7,N24News/imgs/4fcf027d-8a3a-5846-b9eb-60a1641de8e7.jpg,12
Television,"Carl Reiner, Multifaceted Master of Comedy, Is Dead at 98",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/30/arts/television/carl-reiner-dead.html,"Carl Reiner in a 1964 episode of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" In addition to creating and producing the show, Mr. Reiner made occasional appearances as Alan Brady, the comedian for whom the Van Dyke character worked.



Mr. Reiner was a gifted comic actor, but he spent most of his career slightly out of the spotlight -- writing, directing and letting others get the laughs.

Carl Reiner, who as performer, writer and director earned a place in comedy history several times over, died on Monday night at his home in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 98. His death was confirmed by his daughter, Annie Reiner. Mr. Reiner first attracted national attention in 1950 as Sid Caesar's multitalented second banana on the television variety show ""Your Show of Shows,"" for which he was also a writer. A decade later he created ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" one of the most celebrated situation comedies in television history, and teamed with Mel Brooks on the hugely successful ""2000 Year Old Man"" records. His novel ""Enter Laughing"" became both a hit Broadway play and the first of many movies he would direct; among the others were four of Steve Martin's early starring vehicles. He won praise as an actor as well, with memorable roles in films like ""The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming"" and, more recently, ""Ocean's Eleven"" and its sequels. But he spent most of his career just slightly out of the spotlight, letting others get the laughs. His contributions were recognized by his peers, by comedy aficionados and, in 2000, by the Kennedy Center, which awarded him the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. He was the third recipient, after Richard Pryor and Jonathan Winters.

""He was a comedian himself, and he truly understood and still understands comedy,"" Mr. Caesar said of Mr. Reiner in his book ""Caesar's Hours"" (2003), written with Eddy Friedfeld. ""Most people still don't realize the importance of a straight man in comedy, or how difficult that role is. Carl had to make his timing my timing."" Mr. Reiner was, Mr. Caesar added, ""the best straight man I've ever worked with."" As part of a stellar supporting cast that also included Imogene Coca and Howard Morris, Mr. Reiner proved his versatility week after week on ""Your Show of Shows,"" which ran from 1950 to 1954 on NBC and established the template for sketch comedy on television. He played everything from a harried commuter to a frenzied rock 'n' roller to an unctuous quiz-show host. But he is probably best remembered as an interviewer, solemnly posing questions to a mad professor, a spaced-out jazz musician or some other over-the-top character played by Mr. Caesar, and adding to the humor simply by being serious.

""The 2000 Year Old Man"" began as an act Mr. Reiner and Mr. Brooks performed for friends at parties. When they put it on record, it became a phenomenon. There were ultimately five ""2000 Year Old Man"" albums, one of which won a Grammy and all of which are treasured by comedians and comedy fans. Mr. Brooks was the star of the largely improvised routines, reflecting on what it was like to be two millenniums old (none of his thousands of children ever visited) and reminiscing about historical figures like Sigmund Freud (""He was a good basketball player; very few people know that"") and Shakespeare (""He had the worst penmanship I ever saw in my life""). But it was Mr. Reiner who came up with the questions that lit Mr. Brooks's comedic fuse. Indeed, it was Mr. Reiner who spontaneously started the ball rolling one day during a quiet moment in the Caesar writers' room. ""I turned to Mel and I said, 'Here's a man who was actually seen at the crucifixion 2,000 years ago,'"" he told The New York Times in 2009, ""and his first words were 'Oh, boy.'""

The show, ""Head of the Family,"" was not picked up. It became a series only when it was recast with Dick Van Dyke as the central character. The workplace scenes in ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" -- featuring Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie as Mr. Van Dyke's fellow writers, with Mr. Reiner making occasional appearances as their boss, Alan Brady -- were inspired by Mr. Reiner's time with Sid Caesar (although Mr. Reiner insisted that his character was only partly based on Mr. Caesar). The domestic scenes, with Mary Tyler Moore as Mr. Van Dyke's wife, were set in New Rochelle, N.Y., where Mr. Reiner lived at the time, and Ms. Moore's character was modeled on his wife, Estelle. Mr. Reiner later attributed the show's success to the choice of ""somebody with more talent to play me."" Seen on CBS from 1961 until 1966, ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" won a total of 15 Primetime Emmy Awards for its cast and crew, five of them for Mr. Reiner as writer and producer. (He won nine Emmys in his career, including two for his on-camera work on ""Caesar's Hour,"" one as a writer on a 1967 special that reunited the ""Show of Shows"" cast and one for a guest appearance, as Alan Brady, on an episode of the sitcom ""Mad About You"" in 1995.) It is widely regarded as one of the greatest sitcoms of all time.

That same year he made his Broadway debut as a writer and director with ""Something Different,"" the story of a playwright suffering from writer's block. It received generally good reviews (Walter Kerr of The New York Times praised Mr. Reiner's ""nifty habit of approaching a gag at high speed, passing it on the outside, and then noticing where it went in the rearview mirror"") and had a respectable three-month run. By that time, however, Mr. Reiner's focus had shifted westward. He had already appeared in a number of Hollywood movies by the time he and his family moved to Beverly Hills in the late 1960s, and he would continue to show up onscreen occasionally. But for the next three decades, most of his work in Hollywood was done behind the scenes. Carl Reiner was born in the Bronx on March 20, 1922, to Irving Reiner, a watchmaker, and Bessie (Mathias) Reiner. After graduating from Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, he went to work as a machinist's helper and seemed headed for a career repairing sewing machines. Then one day his older brother, Charlie, mentioned seeing a newspaper article about a free acting class being given by the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal jobs agency. Carl tried his hand at acting, found he was good at it, hung up his machinist's apron and joined a theater troupe. He also acted in summer stock. During World War II, Mr. Reiner served in an Army entertainment unit that toured American bases in the South Pacific. After his discharge he joined the road company of the musical revue ""Call Me Mister"" as the comic lead, and within a year he was in the Broadway production. In the 1949-50 television season he was a regular on ""The Fifty-Fourth Street Revue,"" a variety series, and in 1950 he was back on Broadway in ""Alive and Kicking,"" where he caught the eye of Max Liebman, the mastermind of ""Your Show of Shows.""

Mr. Reiner married Estelle Lebost in 1943. She died in 2008. In addition to his daughter, an author and psychoanalyst, he is survived by his sons, Rob, known for directing ""When Harry Met Sally,"" ""A Few Good Men,"" ""This Is Spinal Tap"" and numerous other films and for his role as Archie Bunker's son-in-law on the groundbreaking sitcom ""All in the Family,"" and Lucas, a painter and filmmaker; and five grandchildren. Mr. Reiner's first major box-office success as a director was ""Oh, God!"" (1977), starring George Burns as a very down-to-earth deity and John Denver as the man he chooses to spread his message. Two years later he teamed with Steve Martin, then at the height of his fame as a comedian, for what proved to be a mutually rewarding collaboration. Mr. Reiner first directed Mr. Martin in ""The Jerk"" (1979), a film largely inspired by Mr. Martin's manic stand-up act. The critical response was lukewarm, but the movie was a box-office smash and now often shows up on lists of the best American comedies.

The movies he directed after he stopped working with Mr. Martin -- among them ""Summer Rental"" (1985), with John Candy, and ""Sibling Rivalry"" (1990), with Kirstie Alley and Bill Pullman -- did only somewhat better. In his 70s, he decided that filmmaking demanded ""just too much energy."" He gave it up after making ""That Old Feeling"" (1997), with Bette Midler and Dennis Farina. But he remained active in front of the camera, notably as a crook lured out of retirement by the prospect of sharing in the loot from a Las Vegas casino robbery in Steven Soderbergh's 2001 remake of the Frank Sinatra caper film ""Ocean's Eleven."" He reprised the role in ""Ocean's Twelve"" (2004) and ""Ocean's Thirteen"" (2007). On television he had recurring roles on the sitcoms ""Hot in Cleveland"" and ""Two and a Half Men"" and guest-starred on ""Parks and Recreation,"" ""House"" and other series. He also did voice-over work for several cartoon shows. Mr. Reiner wrote a number of books in addition to ""Enter Laughing,"" including novels, children's books and several memoirs, among them ""My Anecdotal Life"" (2003), ""I Remember Me"" (2013) and ""Too Busy to Die"" (2017). His daughter said another book would be published soon. In 2017 he was prominently featured in ""If You're Not in the Obit, Eat Breakfast,"" a documentary about people who remained active into their 90s. And in his last years he maintained an active Twitter account, which he used primarily for political commentary.","Mr. Reiner was a gifted comic actor, but he spent most of his career slightly out of the spotlight — writing, directing and letting others get the laughs.",323b8c00-9d9a-5a88-99ee-3210bb396a29,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/01/obituaries/00reiner11/merlin_163865157_df162774-2ec7-4604-8ff8-93bb77c191af-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=96ca31be3232af0773be596e6d1e8e99d5a79fe09106a9ecaeacf62300cc94cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mr. Reiner in 2002.

Art & Design,Viewing Europe's Houses of Worship in Wild Detail,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/arts/design/markus-brunetti-review-yossi-milo-gallery.html,"These photographs are like an architect's elevation drawings, only much more solid. They also convey how the cathedrals once sat, and in some cases still do, above their towns and cities like large, protective beasts. Some of the buildings come to feel like the architectural equivalents of Barney. You may want to hug them.

Precedents for Mr. Brunetti's work include the Conceptual German photographers Bernd and Hilla Becher, who spent nearly five postwar decades documenting industrial structures, from shaky coal-mine winding towers to immense grain elevators. August Sander's prewar portraits of people from different German professions have a similar typographical ambition. But Mr. Brunetti's images have their own intense emotional resonance -- the buildings are formidable expressions of collective faith made all the more so by their stalwart refusal to bend to perspective.

This show is a chance to get your European church styles down. There's one example of Romanesque, the Trani Cathedral, in Apulia, Italy, its plain stonework standing in stark, even disapproving contrast to almost everything else here, including the much more ornate cathedral in Siena, Italy, which is Romanesque Gothic.

Then it's mostly Gothic and High Gothic, when the churches reached unprecedented heights in the naves and spires, thanks to the distribution of weight made possible by the Gothic arch (and flying buttresses, like those on the beautiful Flamboyant Gothic Church of the Holy Trinity, in Vendome, France). You see how the sumptuousness of the style made the cathedrals more welcoming and urban. Their many sculptures turned them into bibles of stone while the ribbing and traceries added amazing decorative energy.

Cathedrals were meant to enthrall and awe, so the flock would never turn away from God. But temptation is not absent. It is sometimes a little startling to see that the traceries in the windows -- rose and otherwise -- of cathedrals like Amiens and Vendome are alive with sinuous curves, arabesques and biomorphic shapes that could be given bodily interpretations. Freed of the imperatives of stone narratives, the builders may have seen the windows as a chance to head out on their own, in the direction of Art Nouveau.","Markus Brunetti's photographs of imposing cathedrals and churches, both rustic and grand, show a breathtaking clarity.",d3c45d0f-465c-54fb-8dcf-f9848d943f5e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/06/arts/06brunetti1/30brunetti1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a9a1feb545a470c1b669041b3d923025befe1124958388e0ecdd6982ad8537c8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Wells Cathedral Church of St. Andrew, 2015-2016, by Markus Brunetti.",d3c45d0f-465c-54fb-8dcf-f9848d943f5e,N24News/imgs/d3c45d0f-465c-54fb-8dcf-f9848d943f5e.jpg,14
Style,Abby Phillip Is Next-Gen CNN,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/style/abby-phillip-cnn.html,"It was Friday, Nov. 6, and Ms. Phillip, 31, was sitting screen-left of Jake Tapper, CNN's chief Washington correspondent, and Dana Bash, the network's chief political correspondent, narrating for America what the vote tallies coming in from Georgia and Pennsylvania were indicating and, perhaps more important, what they were signifying. ""For Black women, this has been really a proving moment for their political strength, in carrying Joe Biden to the Democratic nomination through the primary,"" she said. It was the day before victory would be declared for Mr. Biden and Senator Kamala Harris, and three long days after Election Day, this year more of a capstone to a voting season. It was a year in which the treatment of Black women (Breonna Taylor) and the political capital of Black women (Stacey Abrams and voters) had dominated news cycles. Along with a health pandemic that has disproportionately affected people of color, punctuated by a sweeping movement for racial justice. In the 52 hours over five days that the trio would hold court at that desk, there had been plenty of hot takes to fill the airtime. But as Ms. Phillip took command of this particular moment, pablum gave way to prose -- or to a ""historical poetry,"" as she called it: recited in a slow, deliberate cadence distinct from the rat-tat-tat verbal spray that has typified cable news for a generation.

Clips of Ms. Phillip were widely circulated on social media, and her Instagram followers quadrupled. Viewers like Bernice King, the chief executive officer of Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta and the youngest child of Dr. King and Coretta Scott King, shared their appreciation. At a network that draws top viewership at such moments, a star was being born. ""Abby has an intellect that is unmatched, and she has a pretty unique ability to synthesize information quickly both in her reporting and her analysis, and deliver it in a way that meets the viewers where they are,"" said David Chalian, CNN's political director.

Her upbringing, she said, is ""a typical immigrant story."" She was born in Virginia to parents from Trinidad and Tobago, and raised with five siblings. Their father, Carlos Phillip, was a teacher and then an educational psychologist in Washington, D.C. Their mother, June Phillip, is now a realtor. The family returned to Trinidad and Tobago for a few years when Abby was a child, and she had an accent when she returned to America at 9. ""For a lot of years I was very quiet,"" Ms. Phillip said. Teachers would send home notes to her parents that said ""Abby needs to speak up."" Ms. Phillip enrolled at Harvard College in 2006 with plans to study medicine. She joined the staff of the Crimson, the student newspaper, and began to consider journalism as a career after she went on a school-sponsored public service trip through Tennessee and Mississippi, tracing events of the civil rights movement, and after Barack Obama's election her junior year. After graduating in 2010 with a bachelor's degree in government, Ms. Phillip went to blog at Politico. ""Fast and furious,"" she said. Two years later, she moved on to a news fellowship at ABC News, working mostly on ""This Week"" with George Stephanopoulos. Unsure about TV journalism (""I had a lot of concerns about the show business part of it"") she joined The Washington Post as a reporter and helped cover Hillary Clinton's 2016 presidential campaign. After frequent appearances as a political news analyst on CNN, the network hired her in 2017. In a field crowded with fast-talking bros, Ms. Phillip stands out for her reserve. She has always been ""very quiet and ambitious, but she doesn't present in a flamboyant way like some ambitious people do,"" said John Harris, a founder of Politico. ""When I see her on TV, she conveys that sense of poise and self-possession that I remember. What's the next decade going to be like for this exceptional person?"" Nia-Malika Henderson, a senior political reporter at CNN, has an answer. ""I hope when she has her own show she'll have me on it,"" she said.

Like many female reporters, Ms. Phillip has suffered particular public ridicule by the president. In November 2018, after Mr. Trump fired the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, and installed Matthew Whitaker to temporarily lead the Department of Justice, Ms. Phillip was in a gaggle of reporters outside of the White House and asked Mr. Trump if he hoped Mr. Whitaker would tamp down on the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation. ""What a stupid question that is,"" he said. ""What a stupid question. I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions."" In the same time period, President Trump had also castigated two other Black female reporters, saying that a question posed to him by Yamiche Alcindor of PBS was ""racist"" and calling April Ryan of American Urban Radio Networks ""a loser."" This made his rebuke of Ms. Phillip into a bigger story. But ""I didn't feel offended in any way,"" she said. ""I felt like he was lashing out because he didn't like the question, but sometimes the questions he doesn't like are the most important ones."" She added, ""He insults a lot of people and a lot of the time, the insults aren't true."" Ms. Alcindor said her friendship with Ms. Phillip has been crucial in weathering the challenges of covering the Trump administration. ""She has your back. She's a really, really good person,"" she said, as her voice caught. ""It's getting me a little emotional. A rough year like this it puts a lot in perspective."" Ms. Phillip sees an upside. ""In some ways, Donald Trump has made a lot of reporters better reporters,"" she said. ""The relentless fact-checking you have to do with this president is unlike anything I have experienced before. It has done away with the practice of giving figures in Washington the benefit of the doubt when it comes to truthfulness, and that's OK, in a bipartisan way.""

""Why did you say that?"" Ms. Phillip asked. ""Well, as a matter of fact, I didn't say it,"" he replied. Ms. Phillip then turned to Ms. Warren. ""What did you think when Senator Sanders told you a woman could not win the election?"" she asked. Many commentators felt Ms. Phillip should have dropped the matter after Mr. Sanders's denial. The way she saw it, the perception of the electability of women was an important topic of inquiry and she had the two key figures involved in the conversation on a stage in front of her. Why wouldn't she ask them both about it? Why would she accept one person's denial as more valid than another's confirmation? ""If we reported something about Donald Trump, confirmed by multiple sources,"" she said, ""we would stand by that reporting. I don't think it's any different when it's Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. I think about this a lot. Democrats, in particular, will have to figure this out. If Democrats will believe reporting from us about Donald Trump, they should believe our reporting about Bernie Sanders."" In June, Ms. Phillip traveled to Tulsa, Okla., where Mr. Trump was holding his first campaign rally since the nation went into lockdown. Before reporting on the rally, with its much-smaller-than-anticipated turnout, Ms. Phillip filed two pieces about the 1921 destruction of the once-affluent Tulsa neighborhood once known as ""Black Wall Street,"" and the massacre of hundreds of Black Tulsa residents, which came after a white woman accused a Black man of assault. For many supporters of Black Lives Matter in Tulsa, this was an important rejoinder to sentiments Mr. Trump has expressed in a Fox interview that the inequities being protested since the death of George Floyd could be addressed with economic prosperity.

It was, in fact, Ms. Bash's on-air comments about the history being made by Vice President-elect Harris that teed Ms. Phillip up to make her comments about the voting power of Black women. As Ms. Phillip spoke, said Ms. Bash, ""I was recognizing that something special was happening."" At home with their dog, Booker T., Mr. Richardson pumped his fists, knowing his wife was defining a key point of this election. ""Yeah baby, you let them know!'"" he said to himself. Though still busy covering the continued drama over an election that Mr. Trump has yet to concede, Ms. Phillip is now able to get a decent night's sleep and think, free of superstition, about how she performed on the biggest stage of her career thus far. ""Mostly I feel like I did what I wanted to do, which was to be honest and straightforward and knowledgeable and present and to tell the truth,"" she said. ""I didn't go into things wanting to stand out. I went in thinking I want to be a valuable member of the team and I feel good that I did that.""","In an election dominated by fast-talking policy dudes, her deliberate commentary and context stood out.",379ca0b8-f8a7-5bc2-bfde-1099174a2a45,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/14/fashion/13ABBYPHILLIP2/13ABBYPHILLIP2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=bd794ddd40cc89a5162cc8e0b7d133476948246c7f5499aacb36a592187f391f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;In some ways, Donald Trump has made a lot of reporters better reporters,&rdquo; Ms. Phillip said. &ldquo;The relentless fact-checking you have to do with this president is unlike anything I have experienced before.&rdquo;",379ca0b8-f8a7-5bc2-bfde-1099174a2a45,N24News/imgs/379ca0b8-f8a7-5bc2-bfde-1099174a2a45.jpg,15
Music,Remembering the Cranberries' Dolores O'Riordan,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/arts/music/popcast-dolores-oriordan-cranberries.html,"To discuss Ms. O'Riordan's career and legacy, the Popcast guest host Caryn Ganz, the pop music editor for The Times, was joined by Amanda Petrusich, a staff writer for The New Yorker who wrote about Ms. O'Riordan this week, and Charles Aaron, a freelance writer and editor who was on staff at Spin magazine for 16 years and interviewed the Cranberries in 1994 as the band was in the midst of its most successful commercial period.

The panel discussed Ms. O'Riordan's role as a frontperson who showed how women could be both beautiful and fierce, how the media positioned bands led by women in the '90s, the ways in which the Cranberries were an explicitly Irish band (and how ""Zombie"" changed their trajectory) and how the world is absorbing the deaths of central '90s figures.

Technology,"After Fatal Uber Crash, a Self-Driving Start-Up Moves Forward",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/07/technology/uber-crash-autonomous-driveai.html,"FRISCO, Tex. -- On Monday, an orange and blue car with the words ""Self-Driving Vehicle"" prominently displayed on both sides drove itself through the streets of this rapidly growing city north of Dallas, navigating across four lanes of traffic and around a traffic circle. The car, operated by the Silicon Valley start-up Drive.ai, will eventually become part of a fleet of autonomous taxis that will ferry locals along a predetermined route between the Dallas Cowboys facility in Frisco and two other office, retail and apartment complexes. While other companies have tested self-driving cars for years and some are in the early stages of offering a taxi service, Drive.ai's autonomous vehicle debut on Monday was still notable. It was the first new rollout of autonomous cars in the United States since a pedestrian died in Arizona in March after a self-driving car operated by Uber hit her. The fatal crash renewed a debate about driverless technology safety, casting a chill over the industry. Uber immediately halted its testing program, which remains at a standstill. Other big players, including Toyota, also paused their self-driving tests.

But Drive.ai's announcement that it will officially begin its taxi service in July showed that the industry is starting to get back on track. ""You don't succeed by staring in the rearview mirror,"" said Andrew Ng, a board member of Drive.ai, who helped found the artificial intelligence labs at Google and the Chinese internet giant Baidu. Drive.ai said it was moving ahead even as questions about the cause of Uber's crash remained unanswered. Sarah Abboud, an Uber spokeswoman, declined to comment on specifics, citing an continuing investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board. But she said the company had initiated a ""top-to-bottom safety review"" and had brought on Christopher A. Hart, a former chairman of the safety board, as an adviser on its ""overall safety culture.""

""We need to talk about the nitty-gritty -- what these systems are really doing and where their weaknesses are,"" said Mr. Ziyaee, who also worked on autonomous systems at Apple. ""These companies are putting secrecy over safety. That has to change. The public deserves to know how things work."" Mr. Ng said the Uber crash had not affected Drive.ai's rollout plans. ""We're focused on the path forward,"" he said. Drive.ai was founded in 2015 by Mr. Ng's wife, Carol Reiley, a roboticist, and several students who worked in a Stanford University A.I. lab overseen by Mr. Ng. The start-up specializes in a rapidly progressing type of artificial intelligence called deep learning, which allows systems to learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Venture capital firms including New Enterprise Associates have since invested in the start-up. Based in Mountain View, Calif., Drive.ai has raised $77 million and has more than 100 employees. Waymo, the autonomous vehicle company that was spun out of Google, is already running a private taxi service outside Phoenix, in a state that is a popular destination for self-driving car experiments. Drive.ai chose to begin its trials in Frisco, where the streets are clean and wide, pedestrian traffic is light and the sun is out for 230 days a year, on average. A Texas law passed in the fall also lets companies operate self-driving services with no restrictions from municipal governments. When Drive.ai's free, daytime-only service begins this summer, it will be open to 10,000 people who live or work in the area. The cars will travel along a few miles of road where the speed limit does not exceed 45 miles an hour, with passengers being picked up and dropped off at only a few specific locations.

Though pedestrians are scarce in the area, the cars will drive through parking lots where they are likely to encounter foot traffic. So Drive.ai equipped its cars with digital displays designed to communicate with pedestrians and other drivers. While an autonomous vehicle cannot make eye contact with a pedestrian or respond to hand signals, it can display a simple message like ""Waiting for you to cross"" or ""Picking up."" Because the cars are equipped with sensors that gather information about their surroundings by sending out pulses of light -- as well as radar and an array of cameras -- the cars could potentially operate at night as well. But the start-up decided to keep a tight rein on its service before gradually expanding the route and exposing the cars to new conditions. Drive.ai said it would suspend operations during a downpour and in the rare event of snow. There will still be situations where the cars are slow to make decisions on their own -- in the face of extremely heavy traffic, for instance -- but remote technicians employed by Drive.ai will send help to the cars over the internet. The cars will include connections to three separate cellular networks. Drive.ai said it was working closely with Frisco officials. The city of 175,000 can keep the company abreast of construction zones and other road changes, Mr. Ng said, and signs identifying the area where the cars will drive have been installed. Thomas Bamonte, a senior program manager for automated vehicles with the North Central Texas Council of Governments, which handles planning for Dallas and surrounding areas, said such work would become increasingly important as the metropolitan area added roughly a million new people every 10 years. ""We want to invest in new technology rather than the physical expansion of roadways,"" he said. Asked if the Uber crash gave him pause, he said state law allowed companies like Drive.ai to operate without interference from local governments. The companies, he said, must be cautious.",Drive.ai said it would start a taxi service in Texas. It was the first new rollout of autonomous cars in the United States since one operated by Uber killed a pedestrian in March.,05109201-36db-5b3f-99f5-8c5fd65f2fc3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/08/business/08DRIVEAI-1/merlin_137811489_67c1e9c3-97da-4a55-b337-859cd987c62a-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=512e8435032998c037fc44dcee00bf204e4a1e2903c09f7dfe81b82d8c8465be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Drive.ai plans to operate a fleet of autonomous taxis, including this blue and orange vehicle, in a limited area of Frisco, Tex., starting in July.",05109201-36db-5b3f-99f5-8c5fd65f2fc3,N24News/imgs/05109201-36db-5b3f-99f5-8c5fd65f2fc3.jpg,20
Science,Brawling Monkeys. Wandering Deer. Blame Coronavirus.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/science/hungry-monkeys-deer-coronavirus.html,"In a video posted last week, a mob of monkeys runs around a city plaza in Thailand. Something gets thrown in the macaques' midst and they break into a giant brawl.

This horde of animals lives in Lopburi, home of the country's Phra Prang Sam Yot monkey temple. The macaques, which are usually fed by tourists visiting the city, are finding a new scarcity because of the coronavirus. And they're not alone. Large populations of wild animals are sustained almost entirely on treats handed out by tourists in a variety of Asian countries. But over the past few weeks, the flow of tourists has been reduced to a trickle as a result of quarantines, travel restrictions and a general reduction in visitors put in place to stop the spread of the illness.

Now, for better or worse, thousands of animals are being forced to fend for themselves.

Although fights between the macaques of Lopburi are not uncommon, a brawl of the magnitude shown in that video suggests that resources are scarce, said Asmita Sengupta, an ecologist at the Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and Environment in Bangalore, India, who studies the effects of humans feeding macaques, which remain wild animals even if they live in close quarters with people.

""The fall in tourist numbers because of Covid-19 may have indeed brought about a shortage of food supply for them,"" she said. That shows that feeding the monkeys ""can have detrimental effects. Once they get used to being fed by humans, they become habituated to humans and even display hyper-aggression if they are not given food.""","At popular tourist stops in Thailand and Japan, some creatures are going hungry because visitors haven't been turning up to feed them.",76a1202f-e072-56b2-822e-263b4c63a33b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/24/science/16TB-FEEDINGS1/16TB-FEEDINGS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=212adae269ffb5c37c135f588a335e66b4d43db84f1b2e4c9157a68d4b7193cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A macaque enjoyed a juice beverage at the Phra Prang Sam Yot temple in Lopburi, Thailand.",76a1202f-e072-56b2-822e-263b4c63a33b,N24News/imgs/76a1202f-e072-56b2-822e-263b4c63a33b.jpg,2

Health,"In Rehab, 'Two Warring Factions': Abstinence vs. Medication",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html,"Credit...Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times





MURFREESBORO, Tenn. -- Just past a cemetery along a country road, an addiction treatment center called JourneyPure at the River draws hundreds of patients a month who are addicted to opioids and other drugs. They divide their days between therapy sessions, songwriting, communing with horses and climbing through a treetop ropes course. After dinner, they're driven into town in white vans for 12-step meetings. It is a common regimen at residential treatment programs, but as the opioid epidemic persists, JourneyPure is evolving. Though its glossy website doesn't mention it, the company is ramping up its use of medications to blunt the torturous withdrawal symptoms and cravings that compel many with opioid addiction to keep using. There is substantial evidence backing this approach, which is supposed to be used in tandem with therapy. But because two of the three federally approved medicines are opioids themselves, it is spurned by people who believe taking drugs to quit drugs is not real recovery. Addiction experts say such resistance is obstructing efforts to reduce overdose deaths and help addicted Americans get their lives back on track, even as many drain their savings or go into debt paying for repeated stints in residential rehab. Two-thirds of the patients admitted to JourneyPure's program here over the last three months said it wasn't their first time in treatment. ""I'm watching the dominoes fall on our industry,"" said David Perez, JourneyPure at the River's new chief executive, who has helped lead the push toward using more medication-assisted treatment. ""People are dying, and we are feeling more and more impotent to stop it. That is what's shifting beliefs, more than anything.""

The internal tensions over JourneyPure's changing policy, and how proactively it should promote medication as an option, reflect an often reluctant shift taking place in the drug treatment world. At the same time, the Trump administration's view on medication-assisted treatment has evolved from critical to fully supportive. Tom Price, Mr. Trump's first Health and Human Services secretary, appalled many addiction experts by saying, ""If we're just substituting one opioid for another, we're not moving the dial much."" But Mr. Price's successor, Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive, has embraced the approach. When the administration announced $1 billion in new grants to expand access to treatment earlier this year, it emphasized that only programs that made these medicines available were eligible. Mr. Azar has also enlisted his agency's Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives, to reach out and explain the importance of medication to religiously affiliated providers of treatment and recovery services, which tend to embrace an abstinence-only approach. More than 70,000 people in the United States died of overdoses in 2017, and opioids were the main driver. But nationally, 49 percent of the nearly 3,000 residential programs that treat opioid addiction still don't use any of the medications proven to save lives, according to an analysis by amfAR, a foundation that funds AIDS research. Even so, that is an improvement over 2016, when 58 percent weren't using any of them. The strong evidence for medication-assisted treatment has yet to win over not only many treatment providers, but patients themselves. Heather Ramsey, 30, who is six months pregnant, was prescribed one of the medications, buprenorphine, at JourneyPure. Addicted to pain pills and Xanax for half her life, she had finally sought treatment because, she said, ""My body can't take it no more.""

""I feel like I'm kind of, in a sense, cheating the program,"" she said one afternoon in the living room of a residential cottage, adjusting her ponytail after a group meeting with a recovery coach. ""Because I'm still depending on a substance to make me feel normal, and that's not why I came here."" Anti-craving medications are not a silver bullet; relapse is common even among people who take them, and some in fact do better with an abstinence approach. But there is substantial evidence that buprenorphine and a similar drug, methadone -- which has faced ideological resistance on and off for decades -- reduce the mortality rate among people addicted to opioids by half or more; they are also more successful at keeping people in treatment than abstinence-based approaches. A federally funded study last year found that naltrexone, a non-opioid medication that JourneyPure has offered to some patients since it opened in 2015, was just as effective as buprenorphine. But naltrexone, also known by the brand name Vivitrol, is more expensive and people tend not to stay on it as long. It is also harder to start because it requires a long detox period first.

It's true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit -- an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry's role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost. Change started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic. A few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.

Now he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure's Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a ""manifesto"" outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites. ""You've got these two warring factions -- the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,"" he said. ""It's almost like our national politics. Where's the John McCain? Here, it's going to be me."" The medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain's opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more. At Dr. Loyd's urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal. JourneyPure uses an approach known as trauma-informed care, where patients explore traumatic experiences from their past that might help explain their addiction, and learn new ways to cope. Most patients also have mental illnesses like bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder that need to be treated, Mr. MacMaster said. Songwriting and spending time with horses not only help people open up and feel valued, company leaders say, but add to the allure of residential treatment. ""If we went purely science-based, nobody would come to treatment because it would be boring,"" Mr. Perez said.

Some of Dr. Loyd's patients have been arrested for taking the very medications that he and many researchers feel are crucial to their recovery. Miranda Nichols, 25, initially came to JourneyPure a year and a half ago for heroin addiction. When she left after a month, she said, she got a Vivitrol shot but it was so expensive -- her co-payment was $600 -- that she never got another. She returned to shooting heroin, then got pregnant and switched to buprenorphine she bought on the street back home in Alabama because, she said, she could not afford the cash-only clinics that prescribed it there. There, she got charged with theft and ""chemical endangerment of a child,"" the latter because she was taking buprenorphine without a prescription. After a stint in jail, she returned to JourneyPure with a court's permission for more treatment. Dr. Loyd, who had just started working at JourneyPure when she returned, put her back on buprenorphine; Ms. Nichols gave birth to a healthy son in June, after spending three months at the treatment center. She is working for a plant company in Nashville and living with the baby at a recovery home that allows buprenorphine. She lost custody of her two older children after her arrest, however. Her case is supposed to go to trial next year, and Dr. Loyd is writing a letter of support. ""People are getting more educated on buprenorphine now,"" Ms. Nichols said. ""They see my story and what kind of person I am, and they see how it actually works.""

Here in Tennessee -- where overdose deaths rose by 9 percent in 2017, to 1,776, the highest number on record -- the state did little to promote medications for addiction treatment until recently. Over the past year, though, it has started doling out federal funds for expanding medication-assisted treatment to 15 nonprofit programs around the state. State health officials are training employees of the programs how to use the medications and, at times, talking them through their reluctance. ""They had to change their business rules, their philosophy,"" said Taryn Sloss, assistant commissioner for the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. ""A lot of them were abstinence-based and had people in recovery on their boards who thought, 'If it was good enough for me, it's good enough for everyone else.'"" Because they're not eligible for government grants, for-profit companies like JourneyPure don't face as much pressure to embrace medication-assisted treatment. They are regulated through a state licensing process, but Tennessee, like most states, doesn't require medication to be part of their treatment protocol for opioid addiction. Nor do accrediting bodies like the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, although the commission has started requiring programs to help patients access medication if they want it. ""We should make it the standard in terms of running a treatment program that's licensed by a state in the 21st century,"" said Michael Botticelli, who served as the drug czar under President Obama and now leads the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center.

It was late summer at JourneyPure; the horses were grazing behind the barn, and a river burbled behind the cluster of cottages where patients live. Around a conference table in the main building, tensions were crackling over medication-assisted treatment. Dr. Loyd was there, as were Mr. MacMaster and Patrick Dunn, the company's chief of operations development. ""There's a small group who will probably need to be on M.A.T. for the rest of their lives,"" said Mr. MacMaster, who quit drugs and alcohol 30 years ago, mostly through 12-step programs. ""But everybody in this room knows drug-free recovery is really the gold standard."" ""I have to disagree,"" Dr. Loyd said. As a state official, he said, he had seen people enter the state's drug court programs on medication, only to be forced by a judge to go off it and pursue abstinence-based treatment. ""These people were vulnerable, at high risk of overdosing and relapse,"" he said. ""We have to keep as many people alive as we can.""

On a frigid December afternoon, a group of JourneyPure patients gathered for dialectical behavior therapy, which teaches mindfulness and ""distress tolerance"" for getting past negative feelings and events. Shannon Siedzik, 26, diligently took notes. She had come from New Jersey to be treated for heroin addiction, her fourth attempt at rehab, she said. Her insurer had approved only a weeklong stay, and she said she wasn't interested in medication -- she'd had an allergic reaction to buprenorphine when she tried it once. Dr. Loyd had met with her that morning and urged her to try methadone, but she was resisting. A JourneyPure discharge planner had already arranged for her to move into a recovery home in Nashville that did not allow any of the medications. ""I feel pretty good leaving here,"" she said, though she added, ""I won't know where to go if that craving happens.""

After therapy, Ms. Siedzik returned to the house she was sharing with a dozen other women for a 12-step meeting led by a JourneyPure recovery coach. Following the meeting, Christmas music tinkled and several housemates prepared dinner while she stared out the window. Dr. Loyd's plea had jarred her. ""He's worried about me relapsing and overdosing and dying,"" she said quietly. ""It upsets me because it's kind of true. It scares me -- like, a lot."" Dr. Loyd had urged her to call Nashville's only methadone clinic once she left JourneyPure and offered to help find her a spot at a different recovery home that allowed medication. ""It's not a bad idea,"" she said. ""But I'm thinking about the future, getting off of it -- how hard will that be?"" The next morning Ms. Siedzik got a ride to a recovery home indistinguishable from all the other houses on the street in a neighborhood about 15 minutes from downtown Nashville. She hoped to get a Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, a job waitressing and a spot on a recreational soccer team. A week later, she had not called the methadone clinic and said she felt happy with where she had landed.",A reluctant evolution is taking place in residential drug treatment for opioid addiction.

Art & Design,Tales of Hope and Resilience as a Museum Reopens,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/13/arts/design/New-York-Historical-covid-reopen.html,"What will it take for New Yorkers to process the events of the past few months -- the emotional toll of thousands of deaths, social unrest, economic insecurity and the abrupt cessation of life as we knew it? The New-York Historical Society is hoping a new exhibition, humble but moving, can offer a space for some of our feelings to catch up with us. ""Hope Wanted: New York City Under Quarantine"" is an exhibition of oral histories and photography of New Yorkers from across the five boroughs that opens in the museum's West 76th Street courtyard on Aug. 14. It will be one of the first new exhibitions in the city to open since the lockdown began in March, albeit in a garden, with images printed on weatherproof panels and audio content accessible via cellphones. (Across Central Park, the Museum of the City of New York has an outdoor installation of crowdsourced photographs from coronavirus times on its facade and terrace.)

Since the arrival of the coronavirus in the city, Ms. Lucero's work quickly evolved into crisis management. During its peak, she was part of a team giving out care packages containing food, hand sanitizer, masks and gloves to NYCHA residents. As the virus has waned in the city, and a housing crisis looms, she has pivoted to assembling and organizing resources and outdoor events to educate people about their options if they cannot pay rent -- like applying for a ""one-shot deal"" grant through the city. Caught over the phone in early August, Ms. Lucero paused to consider her recent experiences. ""There's no time to think or digest,"" she observed. ""We're at a go-go-go pace, but then there are moments when I actually have a bit of time, and I can take a breath. And when you take that breath, it feels a little painful."" Providing vital resources to those most in need has kept her sane, she explained. ""I think that if I wasn't doing the job that I do now, I would be falling apart.""

""In a lot of ways I needed to do this so I didn't lose my mind,"" Mr. Powell reflected by phone from his home in Fort Greene, Brooklyn. ""I felt very powerless, very helpless. I was having a lot of severe nightmares just because of everything that was happening. It was a lot of emotional turmoil. I knew people who were sick. I lost a family member. I can't just sit here and not help in some way to tell the story of what's happening."" Mark Naison, a 74-year-old Fordham University professor whose words and portrait are featured in the exhibition, understands how gathering tales of the pandemic can help to lift weary spirits. When the coronavirus surged through New York in April, he felt depressed and angry. The Fordham campus closed suddenly, and classes moved online. In addition to the fear that had settled over him, he had lost the two things that ""lit up his life,"" he said recently over the phone -- regular in-person contact with his students, and playing tennis.

But then something changed. His students began participating in Black Lives Matter protests around the country, and a few of them started collecting oral histories from people around the Bronx. Dr. Naison, fueled by a new sense of purpose and hope, began fund-raising to pay them to do that work. ""By the end of the semester, I felt this surge of energy and creativity coming from the students,"" he recalled. ""They've been so inspired by the resilience and courage of the people they interviewed,"" he continued, like Maribel Gonzalez, the owner of a Bronx culinary institution, The South of France, a Puerto Rican restaurant, who has been delivering free food to homebound seniors even as the survival of her business hangs in the balance. ""They say they cry every time they watch the interview,"" Dr. Naison said.

But today, she is still weathering the consequences: She has trouble breathing and is plagued by worries for her children as their schooling is thrown into disarray. Local playgrounds are hotbeds of fear, with little social distancing and mask-wearing. She lives with daily frustration and anger about the inept government response to the pandemic. The public officials ""are more concerned with lining their own pockets and rhetoric than listening to people who actually know better, the epidemiologists, the scientists, the social justice activists,"" she said over the phone recently. Yet the organization she founded, the Black Feminist Project, has seen a groundswell of local support during the pandemic. Through its urban farm, Black Joy Farm, Ms. Fields and her recently expanded team of five have been giving away hundreds of pounds of food every week via their Corona-Relief Food Box. It may be an acute failure of government that has led Ms. Fields's organization to fill the needs of close to 200 families every week, but her story is inspiring nonetheless.

Science,SpaceX and NASA Launch Is First Step to Renewed Human Spaceflight,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/01/science/spacex-crew-dragon-launch.html,"The first American spacecraft capable of carrying astronauts since the retirement of the space shuttles launched early Saturday. A successful mission could put NASA and the United States on the cusp of a renewed era of human spaceflight. There were no people on this demonstration flight, a SpaceX vehicle called Crew Dragon. As lightning sparked in distant skies, the spacecraft lifted off at the appointed time, 2:49 a.m. Eastern Time, from NASA's Kennedy Space Flight Center in Florida. Within 10 minutes the capsule was in orbit, headed toward a Sunday morning rendezvous with the International Space Station.

The launch was also an important step for the goals of Elon Musk, who founded SpaceX in 2002 and who says the objective of the company is to send people to space and eventually Mars. ""It's been 17 years to get to this point,"" said Mr. Musk. He described himself as emotionally exhausted. ""But it worked,"" Mr. Musk said of Crew Dragon. ""So far."" [Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] To date, the company has sent into space only satellites and cargo (and one Tesla sports car). ""We still haven't launched anyone yet, but hopefully, we will later this year,"" Mr. Musk said. ""So that would definitely be a culmination of a long dream for a lot of people, me and a lot of people at SpaceX."" For the past eight years, NASA has been paying for rides on Russian spacecraft to get its astronauts to and from the International Space Station. Instead of developing and operating its own replacement for the space shuttles, NASA has instead turned to private companies to provide that service. In 2014, the space agency awarded two contracts, to SpaceX and to Boeing. The mission that launched Saturday, known as Demo-1, is an end-to-end test of the spacecraft from launch to docking at the International Space Station to re-entering over the United States and splashing down in the Atlantic Ocean.

The capsule is to arrive at the space station on Sunday, about 27 hours after launch. Unlike earlier SpaceX missions that took cargo to the space station, which approached from below and was then grabbed by the station's robotic arm, the Crew Dragon capsule will approach from the front and autonomously dock. After five days at the station, it is scheduled to leave on March 8. Mr. Musk said the most critical portions of the mission are the docking and the re-entry. The Crew Dragon's top half has a more complex shape compared with an earlier version of SpaceX's capsule that only carries cargo. That could cause it to tumble in the atmosphere. ""I think it's unlikely,"" Mr. Musk said. ""We've run simulations a thousand times. But this is a possibility."" The capsule can seat up to seven astronauts, although the early flights will not fill to capacity. For this demonstration flight, one of the four seats is occupied with a sort of artificial person -- what NASA calls an A.T.D. or ""anthropomorphic test device"" -- which is wearing a SpaceX spacesuit. The device includes sensors to measure forces and accelerations that a person would experience on the trip. The SpaceX engineers named it Ripley, after the heroine in the Alien movies played by Sigourney Weaver. The Ripley dummy was accompanied by a plush globe intended to signal when the capsule's occupants became weightless. Video footage in a tweet by Mr. Musk showed the toy lifting from its seat during orbit.","The Crew Dragon capsule carried no crew, but it sets up a near future with astronauts traveling to orbit from the United States again.",f51ec5c5-a9ce-5afb-8b44-6f3485cef738,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/02/science/spacex-img/spacex-img-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=67fe23002abb08313e841d14fed92ea2387b53093c247918fdb8df7ea759189d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifting off on Saturday in Cape Canaveral, Fla.",f51ec5c5-a9ce-5afb-8b44-6f3485cef738,N24News/imgs/f51ec5c5-a9ce-5afb-8b44-6f3485cef738.jpg,2
Movies,"'Ghostbusters,' 'Spider-Man: Far From Home': This Week's Best Trailers",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/movies/ghostbusters-trailer.html,"Some trailers take forever to drop. The first clip for ""Spider-Man: Far From Home"" was expected more than a month before it finally materialized online. Others, like the surprise spot for the new ""Ghostbusters,"" seemingly appear out of nowhere.

The initial teaser for the director Jason Reitman's sequel to his father Ivan's '80s comedies doesn't reveal much, aside from the spirit-hunting team's Ecto-1 transport, which has been gathering dust in a barn. All we know is the movie won't feature the characters from the female-centric 2016 reboot. No word on whether any original stars will return, but Dan Aykroyd did tweet to Reitman, ""If you need a tune-up, you know who to call.""

Peter Parker (Tom Holland) leaves Queens to take a school trip to England, but he can't escape his Spidey responsibilities after he gets a surprise visit from Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson), who recruits him to join the previously unseen superhero Mysterio (Jake Gyllenhaal) and fight creatures wreaking destruction across Europe. Set to the Ramones' ""I Wanna Be Sedated,"" this zippy trailer has the opposite effect.

The third installment of Keanu Reeves's ultraviolent action franchise looks likely to erase any memories of his recent flop, ""Replicas."" As his John Wick is expelled from the assassins' union known as the High Table, Reeves is joined by a pair of Oscar-winning actresses, Anjelica Huston and Halle Berry. A seemingly ill-suited tune, Andy Williams's version of ""The Impossible Dream (The Quest),"" gives the trailer a kitschy kick.

Andre Holland reteams with the director Steven Soderbergh (from the series ""The Knick"") and the playwright turned screenwriter Tarell Alvin McCraney (""Moonlight"") for this feature about a sports agent trying to maneuver around an N.B.A. lockout. The trailer spotlights the impressive ensemble -- including Zazie Beetz, Zachary Quinto and Kyle MacLachlan -- and moves with the speed and grace of a hoops superstar.

Tessa Thompson has moved fluidly between blockbusters (""Thor: Ragnarok,"" ""Creed"") and lower-budget fare (""Sorry to Bother You""), and this puts her back in indie territory. She plays an ex-drug dealer who returns to a life of crime after her pregnant sister (Lily James, a long way from ""Downton Abbey"") seeks refuge from a brutal ex. The stark trailer for the director Nia DaCosta's drama evokes memories of the Oscar-nominated ""Winter's Bone.""","The movies won't be coming for a while but clips for those fan favorites along with ""John Wick 3,"" ""High Flying Bird"" and ""Little Woods"" were strong too.",164168ae-4054-5fdd-8194-2d3f57a5eede,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/18/movies/18trailers-week1/18trailers-week1-facebookJumbo.png?year=2019&h=502&w=960&s=e3d09804da3c40f81b1210788effda9051a8fc3e1dfccef471a98e6b349331bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from the trailer for ""Spider-Man: Far From Home.""",164168ae-4054-5fdd-8194-2d3f57a5eede,N24News/imgs/164168ae-4054-5fdd-8194-2d3f57a5eede.jpg,5
Automobiles,"Yes, Gawkers: Attention Must Be Paid",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/19/automobiles/autoreviews/review-2015-bmw-i8.html,"BMW's i8 plug-in hybrid may be as fast as a Corvette Stingray, but it made me late every time I drove it. Fast getaways should be a given, considering the BMW's jaw-dropping 3.8-second surge to 60 miles per hour. The problem is that the simple act of opening the i8's ""swan wing"" doors brought gawkers running -- that is, if they weren't already snapping photos, as happened after midnight in Manhattan when I found tourists surrounding the parked i8. The bombastic attitude of, say, a Lamborghini can make passers-by keep their distance. But the i8's ""Back to the Future"" vibe drew people, including proponents of green technology, who said they rarely made a fuss over cars. Bystanders, in fact, constantly invoked the DeLorean from the Michael J. Fox movies as they enthused over the BMW's cinematic shape. The i8 may not have 1.21 gigawatts, but designers created the i8 to thrill and enlighten would-be Doc Browns: Born from the company's multibillion-dollar investment in sustainable transportation, the i8 was intended to look, drive and even sound like a sports car of the future.

As with some other electrified cars, including the Tesla Model S, the BMW's exclusivity can dampen the feel-good story. At $136,650 to start, and with BMW declining to estimate production totals, the i8 is too rich and too rare to save the planet. But its technology, especially its groundbreaking use of carbon fiber, may influence a global trend to drastically reduce vehicle weight and therefore improve efficiency. That trend is already spotlighted in the i8's sister car, the distinctive but less breathtaking i3 city car, which at $42,300 is easily the most affordable carbon-fiber-intensive car in history. In both ""i"" models, the passenger cell is formed of light yet ultrastrong carbon fiber in a patented process that molds components in minutes, rather than over the thousands of hours it once took to craft the material by hand for cars that cost $1 million and more. Even with 7.1 kilowatt-hours of lithium batteries strung below its floor, the i8 weighs 3,455 pounds, about 480 less than a similarly sized Aston Martin DB9 and some 1,200 less than the Tesla. Slashing weight sets off a chain of energy-saving benefits, allowing lighter, less-powerful batteries, engines, brakes and other components to meet the desired level of performance. The BMW happily demonstrated its dual personalities on the street. As for one question: The BMW whips the battery-bloated Tesla in acceleration and agility. (The coming Tesla Model D might end up faster in a straight line, yet the BMW is vastly more connected and engaging everywhere else.) But the BMW's back seat is purely for luggage or child seats, whereas the Tesla is a spacious luxury car, so the comparison is not green apples to green apples. The i8's front wheels are driven by a 129-horsepower electric motor and a 2-speed transmission that operate entirely behind the scenes. The rear wheels are served by a 228-horsepower turbocharged 1.5-liter 3-cylinder (adapted from the Mini Cooper) with integrated electric assist. Using paddles or a console lever, drivers operate a spectacularly quick 6-speed automatic transmission to manage a total of 357 horsepower and 420 pound-feet of torque.

I first toggled up the eDrive mode, which propels the i8 for up to 22 miles strictly on front-drive electricity, albeit at a Prius-like pace of 9.5 seconds to 60 m.p.h. and a top speed of 75 m.p.h. But since the BMW's all-wheel-drive Sport mode can replenish the battery on the fly (adding one mile of E.V. range for roughly every 17 miles driven), eDrive mode has a philosophical purpose beyond short electric commutes: For modern megacities like London that charge entry fees for internal-combustion vehicles -- and may one day ban them -- hybrids like the i8 could conserve or replenish the battery range to qualify for entry. The BMW defaults to a Comfort mode that maximizes electric efficiency, but automatically blends in engine power when the driver shoves harder on the accelerator. That mode produced the best gas-electric mileage, with gentle driving eking out 38 m.p.g. on the highway. Over several rip-roaring days, the BMW delivered a solid 31 m.p.g. over all, 3 better than the E.P.A.'s combined city and highway estimate. That economy was about 50 percent higher than the 20 m.p.g. I've experienced in rival sports cars like the Stingray and Porsche 911. With wall current far cheaper than gasoline, the E.P.A. figures a bigger edge in energy costs. The i8 owner will pay $1,550 a year in electricity and gasoline to cover 15,000 miles, compared with $2,800 for the Stingray and $3,700 for the Aston DB9. The E.P.A. credits the i8 with 76 m.p.g.e. (the electrical equivalent of a gallon of gasoline) in eDrive mode, within sight of the Tesla's 89 m.p.g.e. The Tesla, of course, can cover roughly 250 miles on batteries alone, while the BMW must sip premium unleaded to raise the total range to 330 miles. But here's what the Tesla can't do: keep pace on a track or on twisty roads with Porsches, Corvettes or BMW's own M3 and M4 -- with fill-ups around every corner and no worries about being stranded with an empty battery. As for the cabin, it's clear that BMW wanted the i8 to feel like an everyday sports car, with no intimidation factor.

Reminiscent of the 6 Series, the interior is intimate and luxurious, including enviro-friendly leather and a 10.2-inch iDrive screen, but one could quibble that the cabin doesn't match the avant-garde dazzle of the exterior. The efficiency-coaching digital driver's displays are cramped and not terribly exciting. Available blue seatbelts that match the two-tone exterior trim add some sci-fi flair. With efficiency runs out of the way, it was time to pivot open the featherweight doors, climb over the awkward sills (falling into the car is almost easier) and admire the performance. What I couldn't admire was the electric motor under the hood. If the i8's lowercase name recalls an iPhone, the car mimics one as well: Officially, the sealed hood can be opened only by technicians. And there's barely enough storage in the cabin for that iPhone. Perhaps it's better to imagine that a profligate engine is under the hood. Step on the i8's throttle, and after a beat of turbo lag, you're whisked into motion like sauce in a blender, propelled by 420 pound-feet of electric-boosted torque. Abetted by the stellar transmission, upshifts unleash a crackling barrage that you'd swear was old-school internal combustion. In reality, the BMW pipes a synthesized simulation of engine noise through door speakers to complement the exhaust soundtrack. It sounds so incredible -- like a Porsche flat 6 hooked to a humming flying saucer -- that you'd never know a miniature 3-cylinder was doing the work. Initial handling impressions were less positive: omnipresent understeer and a relative shortage of tire grip. The 20-inch tires are indeed much narrower than typical sports car tires, helping to save fuel. But my impressions rapidly changed: The faster you go, the more the BMW balances out, with beautifully quick steering and rock-solid poise aided by a lengthy 110-inch wheelbase. The brakes feel strong and natural by the standards of hybrid cars, though their regenerative function makes them touchy in low-speed traffic. For some electric-car fans, one i8 number that's out of balance is the price, which on the test car reached $138,650 with one option, a $2,000 Giga World leather package. But the i8 is at once an auto-show exotic, a technological tour de force and a BMW. Anyone who expected it to sell for the price of a Chevy Volt, or even the Tesla Model S, was bound to be disappointed. I've also heard suggestions that the i8's design may not age well, because it's so singular, truly of-the-moment. I think the opposite is true. The most collectible cars of any era are striking, rare, advanced and high-performing, and evoke nostalgia for their specific era. The i8 fits four of those descriptions, with nostalgic yearnings for 2014 yet to be determined. And unlike the notoriously slow and unreliable DeLorean, the BMW is actually a car worth driving.","BMW's fast and fuel-efficient i8 is a hybrid sports car that draws a crowd.

Real Estate,Doing Time on the River,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/12/realestate/streetscapes-the-penitentiary-on-roosevelt-island.html,"PLANS are moving ahead to replace the 1939 Goldwater Hospital on Roosevelt Island with a $2 billion graduate school in applied sciences. This will be a new chapter in the history of the island, which for 100 years was a center of refuge and care, with hospitals and asylums. But the island had yet another career. For a century, it housed a grim penitentiary, where inmates passed their sentences along the banks of the East River, within tempting sight of freedom on the nearby shores. The penitentiary, a long gray arcaded structure, was completed in 1832 on what was then Blackwell's Island. Castlelike crenelations running along the roofline and a chubby turreted tower of a ""feudal character"" lent a ""certain rudeness"" to the work, according to Appleton's Dictionary of New York of 1886. The New York Spectator reported in 1836 that the original plan had been to split the island in half with a canal to separate male and female inmates. This precaution was never taken, although the women got their own building.

The name of the architect has been lost. The original prison population on Blackwell's Island was in the hundreds, and in 1838 the staff of 24 included a quarry master and a coxswain to pilot the island boat. There was no mollycoddling the inmates in those days: John Bowen, convicted in 1839 of stealing a basket, was sentenced to three months breaking rocks. But there was preferential treatment: William M. Tweed, serving time in 1874, had a private unlocked room and a secretary. The sight of river traffic going by tortured the prisoners. In 1853 12 nude men swam for freedom and were spotted coming out of the water at what is now Long Island City; it is not clear if they were apprehended. In 1875 Dutch Harmon, a highwayman described by The New York Times as ""one of the most desperate criminals in the country,"" organized the mass escape of seven prisoners while wearing a ball and chain. Yet Patrick Hayes, the warden in 1910, described the penitentiary to The New York Times as a place ""as pleasant as the Thousand Islands."" The convicts, he said, worked in ""big airy rooms through which cool breezes sweep,"" with views of ""the yachts of millionaires"" gliding past. Thomas Edison cruised past the island with cameras rolling in 1903; his short film is posted on YouTube. Two years later David D. Lewis, who was serving 12 months for fraud, dared to differ. He made a brazen escape attempt, climbing up one of the stone abutments of the Queensboro Bridge and grabbing hold of a cable. Ignoring police gunfire from the island, he climbed hand over hand to the girders and then to the roadway, where he found two bicycle policemen waiting. A report issued in 1914 by Katharine Davis, the commissioner of correction, described the prison as ""vile and inhuman"" and ""wet, slimy, dark, foul."" Later that year, 700 of the 1,400 prisoners joined an uprising that lasted for days.

But one keeper, quoted in The Times, said: ""They have it easy here, and are too humanely treated. They need a little harsh treatment to make them realize what a fine hotel they are living in."" In any event, not much changed. A raid by the Department of Correction in 1934 found gangs ruling the prison with the complicity of the warden and his deputy. Knives and drugs were discovered in cells. Joseph Rao, a member of the Dutch Schultz gang who was imprisoned in the 1930s, kept a flock of homing pigeons on the roof, for importing narcotics. Instead of stripes, he wore silk shirts and dressing gowns. By Rao's time, a prison was going up on Rikers Island, and the penitentiary was on its way out. In 1939, the same year John Garfield starred in the movie ""Blackwell's Island -- Alcatraz of the East,"" a hospital for chronic diseases opened on the site. Now the Coler-Goldwater Specialty Hospital and Nursing Facility, it was designed by Kohn & Butler and York & Sawyer. Its chevron-shaped wings, canted back to face the river, have a marine character, like the conning towers on Arizona-type battleships. These will vanish within a few years, replaced by a complex of shiny, sharp, angular structures that, judging by published renderings and animations, look like the desert headquarters of a giant mortgage company in Arizona. At their feet, all around, will lie the last traces of the penitentiary and its inmates: much of the rocky sea wall was created with stone they quarried.","For a century, Roosevelt Island housed a grim penitentiary.

Sports,Tiger Woods's Return Puts His Back in the Spotlight Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/sports/golf/tiger-woods-phil-mickelson-brady-manning.html,"The charity golf exhibition with Rory McIlroy and friends was a nice opening act, but the sport's headliner returns this weekend. On Sunday, Tiger Woods will play for the first time in three months, ending his longest layoff since recovering from spinal fusion surgery in 2017. Woods and Phil Mickelson will reprise their match-play showdown of 2018, this time to benefit coronavirus relief efforts and in pairings with the former N.F.L. rivals Peyton Manning and Tom Brady.

The appearance will be a meaningful opportunity to assess the fitness of not just Woods's golf game but also his back, which after four operations is an anatomical wild card. The competitive golf world's last glimpse of Woods, 44, was in mid-February, when he was stiff and uncomfortable as he shot an ignominious 11 over par in the final two rounds of the Genesis Invitational to finish last among the golfers who made the cut.

It appeared to be a minor setback at the time. But roughly a month later, citing trouble with his cranky back, Woods withdrew from a series of high-profile March tournaments, including the Arnold Palmer Invitational, which he has won eight times, and the PGA Tour's signature event, the Players Championship. When the PGA Tour was suspended soon afterward, with the Masters postponed the same day because of the coronavirus pandemic, Woods was idled like thousands of other pro athletes around the globe.

But Woods, unlike most of his brethren, has a shrinking window to add to his celebrated sporting legacy. He is tied with Sam Snead for the most career PGA Tour victories with 82, and his 15 major golf championship titles are three behind the record total won by Jack Nicklaus. It's not just Woods's age that will pose a challenge going forward; there are questions about how long his back can hold out.","Woods said his balky back had improved greatly since mid-February, when he played his last tournament, and called the difference ""night and day.""",bd8e2dde-8a9b-59c5-8d53-92eecc3e4800,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/19/sports/19golf-tiger/19golf-tiger-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=76dcd99dc05851ad1935085ec57dc86348897dca69adbe619396a9523e6f9b07&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Competitive golf's last glimpse of Tiger Woods was in mid-February, when he was stiff and uncomfortable as he shot 11 over par in the final two rounds of the Genesis Invitational.",bd8e2dde-8a9b-59c5-8d53-92eecc3e4800,N24News/imgs/bd8e2dde-8a9b-59c5-8d53-92eecc3e4800.jpg,9
Health,Why You Shouldn't Worry About Studies Showing Waning Coronavirus Antibodies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/coronavirus-antibodies-studies.html,"The portion of people in Britain with detectable antibodies to the coronavirus fell by roughly 27 percent over a period of three months this summer, researchers reported Monday, prompting fears that immunity to the virus is short-lived. But several experts said these worries were overblown. It is normal for levels of antibodies to drop after the body clears an infection, but immune cells carry a memory of the virus and can churn out fresh antibodies when needed. ""Some of these headlines are silly,"" said Scott Hensley, an immunologist at the University of Pennsylvania. Declining antibody levels after the acute infection has resolved ""is the sign of a normal healthy immune response,"" Dr. Hensley said. ""It doesn't mean that those people no longer have antibodies. It doesn't mean that they don't have protection.""

The research also raised some fears about the ability of vaccines to help populations reach herd immunity, the point at which enough people would be immune to the coronavirus to thwart its spread. It's too early to know how long immunity to the new coronavirus lasts, and whether people can be reinfected many months to a year after a first bout with the virus. Still, experts said worries about vaccines, too, are unwarranted. ""The vaccine doesn't have to mimic or mirror the natural infection,"" said Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology. ""Certainly I wouldn't be alarmist about these data."" The new results indicate the prevalence of coronavirus antibodies in the broader population but not in specific individuals. Several studies looking at antibody levels in individuals have shown that after some initial decline, the levels hold steady for at least four to seven months. The British report is based on three rounds of antibody blood tests carried out in 350,000 randomly selected people from June 20 to Sept. 28. The participants tested themselves at home for antibodies using finger-prick assays that deliver a yes-or-no result, much like a pregnancy test.

Over the three-month period, the proportion of people with detectable antibodies in their blood dropped to 4.8 percent from 6 percent, the researchers reported. The smallest decline was among people ages 18 to 24 and the biggest in those over age 75. Looking at the data a different way, about 73 percent of people who had antibodies early on still produced a positive result months later, noted Dr. Antonio Bertoletti, a virologist at Duke NUS Medical School in Singapore. ""That's not such a dramatic decline.""
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. Antibodies also represent only one arm of the immune response, albeit the one that can most easily be measured. There are at least three other branches of the immune system that can fend off illness, so antibody levels don't present the full picture. ""It's not the whole immune response,"" said Dr. Paul Elliott, an epidemiologist at Imperial College London who heads the project. When the body encounters a pathogen, it rapidly produces antibodies that recognize the invader. Once the acute infection resolves, the levels decline -- as they must for purely practical reasons. ""Our lymphatic system, where immune cells are, only has a finite amount of space,"" Dr. Hensley said. Depending on the test used, the small amount of antibodies still circulating in the blood may not be enough for a positive signal. The test used in the study has a sensitivity of 84.4 percent, well below that of lab-based tests that hover around 99 percent. That means it may miss anyone who has low antibody levels.

For example, people with mild to no symptoms may have produced fewer antibodies than those with severe illness. Most of the people with positive results were ill in March or April, at the peak of the outbreak in Britain, but about 30 percent did not recall having any Covid-19 symptoms. Even a small decrease in the amount of antibodies may drop their levels below the limit of detection. ""We're saying the antibody response has declined below the threshold"" of detection, Dr. Elliott said. ""This is not a surprise to anyone who works in the field."" Data from monkeys suggests that even low levels of antibodies can prevent serious illness from the virus, if not a re-infection. Even if circulating antibody levels are undetectable, the body retains the memory of the pathogen. If it crosses paths with the virus again, balloon-like cells that live in the bone marrow can mass-produce antibodies within hours. A very small number of people may not make any antibodies. But even those people may have immune cells called T cells that can identify and destroy the virus. The vast majority of people infected with the coronavirus develop lasting cellular responses, according to several recent studies. T cells are unlikely to prevent infection, but they may at least prevent serious illness by blunting the attack, Dr. Crotty said. Given all that, he said, interpreting low antibody levels to mean that immunity disappears, or that coronavirus vaccines will not be effective is ""wrong."" For example, the human papillomavirus ""elicits a terrible immune response and lousy antibodies,"" he said. ""But the vaccine with a single immunization elicits fantastic antibodies that are 99 percent protective in people for 10-plus years, just a complete night-and-day difference."" Vaccines can also be designed to provoke much stronger responses than the natural infection, he added.","Experts say it's normal for levels of antibodies to drop after clearing an infection, and that they represent just one arm of the immune response against a virus.",1a2b7e77-345c-588d-a674-996e357a7197,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/27/science/27VIRUS-ANTIBODIES/27VIRUS-ANTIBODIES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=e7e3ba0e6aede9528ba7d9c4e07db50373e5a1f9c018bda81559b25e816a3b85&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Immune cells carry a memory of a virus and can churn out fresh antibodies when needed, experts said.",1a2b7e77-345c-588d-a674-996e357a7197,N24News/imgs/1a2b7e77-345c-588d-a674-996e357a7197.jpg,1
Fashion & Style,Yarn Bombing Hits the High Street,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/fashion/london-kaye-yarn-crochet-artist-starbucks-gap-valentino.html,"Not long ago, a street artist named London Kaye became embroiled in an unexpected controversy. A flea market in Bushwick, Brooklyn, partnered with her to create a large-scale installation. So Ms. Kaye crocheted a portrait, measuring 15 feet by 10 feet, of Sam Shakusky from Wes Anderson's ""Moonrise Kingdom"" holding hands with the creepy twins from ""The Shining."" ""It was about young love,"" she said. Not everyone was charmed. Though Ms. Kaye did not know, the flea market hadn't secured permission to hang her work on an adjacent building. Anti-gentrification activists took their frustrations against her to social media. Gothamist reported that one aggrieved person equated Ms. Kaye and her work to ""colonizers who claim indigenous lands for themselves."" ""I was the perfect scapegoat,"" said Ms. Kaye, who is 28. ""It was three white kids holding hands -- it was huge."" She took the installation down. There may be a double standard here. Few would call Banksy's work gentrifying, but Ms. Kaye's genre of street art, known as ""yarn bombing,"" has been widely derided as a hipster fad or dismissed as cutesy, mere ""women's work.""

But Ms. Kaye is proving it to be much more. In her hands, crochet is both an outlet of creative feminist expression and a lucrative career. Her boundary-unraveling work is appearing throughout the culture, from high fashion to the heart of the mass market. There's no question that the needle arts are having a moment. ""It used to be that a lot of people didn't like crochet or relegated it to your mother's afghan, but there's been a big renaissance,"" said Trisha Malcolm, editor in chief of Vogue Knitting.

She pointed to designers like ICB, Ryan Roche, Rosetta Getty and Tommy Hilfiger, who are ""updating traditional techniques,"" moving around sweater cables, creating big holes and crocheting bikinis. This year also saw the release of the critically acclaimed documentary ""Yarn,"" about international yarn bombers, and the Museum of Arts and Design in New York is exhibiting an elaborate crochet coral reef.

Vogue Knitting has just begun a redesign and expects to turn out 8,000 people at its Vogue Knitting Live symposium in Times Square in January. Ms. Kaye is crocheting 10 historic Vogue covers for the event. ""You've still got the core crocheter who buys acrylics in Walmart,"" Ms. Malcolm said. ""But it's a big trend in the younger kids. London is almost like a spokesperson for that group. She's the super-creative crocheter who will cover anything."" Among Ms. Kaye's projects this year were the facade of a school bus for a Gap holiday commercial and a 5 1/2 -by-15-foot installation of Conan O'Brien with four Rockettes to promote his recent show at the Apollo. She also designed 18 window displays for Valentino and a five-piece capsule collection for the brand, featuring a crochet applique of herself: big blue eyes, bright yellow hair and languid, spaghetti-like limbs. (Ms. Kaye attended New York University on a dance scholarship and jokes that all her crochet girls have perfect technique.) The aesthetic is a bit South Park-y, but skews sunny, not snarky. ""I love dressing my crochet girl up, making her fun and fabulous and putting her in weird situations,"" Ms. Kaye said. One piece, hung on a fence under the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, featured the girl swooning over an alien; the girl's face also appears on the Valentino sweater, and Ms. Kaye revels in the strangeness of wearing the design. ""It was like I had two heads,"" she said. Ms. Kaye quit her day job, at an Apple Genius Bar in downtown Manhattan, a year ago, but still seems awed by the demand for her work. She's been knitting since middle school in Agoura Hills, Calif., and keeps a book of yarn samples in her studio from that time.

That -- and a collection of bags she crocheted in college and failed to sell at a SoHo street fair -- are reminders of how far she's come. She learned about yarn bombing four years ago, when she happened to sell a computer to Agata Oleksiak, one of the world's most pre-eminent yarn artists. ""She had a crazy crochet bag,"" Kaye said. ""I started Googling her."" After reading about Ms. Oleksiak, Ms. Kaye grabbed a scarf she had made and wrapped it around a tree outside her apartment. She assumed someone would rip it down, but nobody did. Ms. Kaye then gave herself a challenge: Yarn bomb something new for 30 consecutive days. She made it to 50. Though Ms. Kaye said she has been stopped by the police four times, her work quickly attracted positive attention. In 2014, a Starbucks store designer happened upon 10 ""Nutcracker"" dancers she had hung on a fence. Soon, the company hired her to yarn bomb around a new Brooklyn store location. Valentino contacted her after seeing a video of subway poles she had adorned. Then Miller Lite asked her to crochet a billboard in Times Square. In the last three years, Ms. Kaye has created a textile collection for ABC Carpet & Home and worked on social media and commercials for Isaac Mizrahi Craft, Delivery.com, TBS and Progressive car insurance. (Flo, it turns out, makes a terrific crochet girl.) Akin McKenzie, the production designer for Gap spot that is currently running, said Ms. Kaye manages to both embrace and subvert the stereotype of the grandmother knitting on the couch. ""When you merge that image with a new imagining of it, you get something special that doesn't have a defined demographic,"" he said.","The clients for London Kaye, a crochet artist, have included Starbucks, Miller Lite, Valentino, Gap and Progressive car insurance.",d28a4ee4-3cb5-5426-8a3a-c34a62e6131b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/04/fashion/KAYE1/KAYE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=c2eaff2cdad6d28176078863bea43436417bd45219173e3eba7bcdea71d47cb5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"London Kaye at her studio in Bushwick, Brooklyn.",d28a4ee4-3cb5-5426-8a3a-c34a62e6131b,N24News/imgs/d28a4ee4-3cb5-5426-8a3a-c34a62e6131b.jpg,19
Theater,Review: Tracing 'Plot Points in Our Sexual Development' Without the Usual Map,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/22/theater/plot-points-in-our-sexual-development-review.html,"""If you're trying to break up with me, just man up and do it.""

In a play about an ordinary couple, that might be no more than a mild crack. But in ""Plot Points in Our Sexual Development,"" which opened on Monday at the Claire Tow Theater, it's a game changer.

Cecily, the character who angrily flings the line, is a cisgender lesbian. Theo, at whom she flings it, is a self-described ""genderqueer trans person who is not a woman and is not a man, but is kind of a man, who loves lesbian jokes.""

Forty minutes into an hourlong work that has, until then, seemed restrained and respectful to the point of tediousness, ""man up"" comes off as intensely provocative, both on the part of Cecily and on the part of the playwright, Miranda Rose Hall. It's a phrase that acknowledges the complications of gender and sexuality as they are ever more finely sliced today -- but it's also a challenge to live beyond abstractions.

The play, Ms. Hall's first professional production, faces a similar challenge. As directed by Margot Bordelon for LCT3, it seems for most of its length to keep present-tense emotion at bay, as if in some kind of exercise or ritual. As the lights rise on the barest of stages -- just two chairs, a door and a herringbone parquet -- Cecily (Marianne Rendon) and Theo (Jax Jackson) are seated well apart from each other, facing straight ahead.",Miranda Rose Hall's new play about the relationship between a lesbian and a male-identified trans person grows as it goes along.,3861c618-794f-5be6-929e-baa9a760735c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/23/arts/23plotpoints2/23plotpoints2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9cfd38e16d1b35dc8a6a0df8ca0f7d8a57ffcbe8e472d5a745a9e4d094cda0b0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Marianne Rend&oacute;n, left, and Jax Jackson are a couple figuring things out in Miranda Rose Hall&rsquo;s play at LCT3.",3861c618-794f-5be6-929e-baa9a760735c,N24News/imgs/3861c618-794f-5be6-929e-baa9a760735c.jpg,10
Technology,Legislator Targets Tech Perks in Baltimore County District,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/technology/legislator-targets-tech-perks-in-baltimore-county-district.html,"Baltimore County Public Schools has pursued one of the most ambitious classroom technology makeovers in the United States. Now, some of its relationships with technology vendors are coming under intensified scrutiny. A Maryland state legislator said Thursday that the state needed to investigate whether industry perks played a role in the awarding of the district's technology contracts. The lawmaker, Senator James Brochin, called on the Maryland State Board of Education to conduct an audit of the contracts. In 2014, the district committed $205 million for laptops for students and staff, and millions more since for math and language software. The audit would cover the device contract, which was awarded to a vendor whose laptop came in third place in the district's hardware evaluations. Last week, an article in The New York Times examined Baltimore County, the nation's 25th-largest public school district, as a case study in how tech companies court and cultivate school leaders. The Baltimore Sun has recently written about the former district superintendent's travels to out-of-state events.

The Times found that tech vendors or industry-funded groups paid for meals and rooms at fancy hotels for school leaders, as well as travel to conferences to promote the district's tech initiative. And in February, the district's former superintendent participated in confidential meetings with school tech vendors -- companies whose contracts were later increased.

""Evidence offered in the recent articles indicates digital education companies having unrestricted access to key decision makers in Baltimore County Public Schools and, in turn, the awarding of contracts to those companies,"" Senator Brochin, a Baltimore County Democrat, said in a letter sent to state officials. ""This has created the illusion of impropriety, thereby eroding public trust."" In response to questions about the audit request and potential conflict-of-interest issues regarding tech vendors, Mychael Dickerson, a school district spokesman, said the district had ""answered all the questions we intend to answer on this matter."" This past spring, the district's superintendent resigned without citing a reason. In an email to reporters last week, Verletta White, the district's interim superintendent, wrote, ""I do not believe there are any conflicts of interest"" related to the district's tech initiative.

The push for an examination comes as some parents, ethicists and legal experts are calling for greater transparency in school-vendor relationships. ""Anything that involves trips to fancy hotels should be looked at pretty closely by school boards,"" said James E. Tierney, a former attorney general of Maine who is a lecturer at Harvard Law School, ""and they should decide whether the ultimate users -- kids -- are getting the right products."" Senator Brochin said he was concerned about Baltimore County's ties to a firm called the Education Research and Development Institute or ERDI. Among other services provided by ERDI, it charges a company $13,000 to facilitate one three-hour meeting between corporate representatives and five superintendents or other school officials to discuss products, according to an ERDI membership rate card. ERDI has in the past paid superintendents $2,000 per conference and covered their travel to conferences held at hotels like the Four Seasons in Baltimore. Baltimore County's previous superintendent received payments last year as an adviser to a company that owned ERDI, according to his district financial disclosure. The Times last week reported that Ms. White, the interim superintendent, had been involved with ERDI events since 2013, where she provided guidance to ed-tech companies. On Wednesday, The Baltimore Sun reported that Ms. White had been paid about $3,000 a year by ERDI in that time. The district declined to provide The Times with a list of the companies Ms. White met with at ERDI.",A state legislator called for an audit of Baltimore County Public Schools' multimillion-dollar technology initiative.,bdc258e3-5b74-5e72-b379-d230d2a1d1bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/business/10EDTECH1/10EDTECH1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=d870e4ceab4cf2f2b2baa4ab34f90cc9dd9922a062f096b831f0d650797f51d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ryan Imbriale, an administrator in Baltimore County Public Schools, with a class using laptops last year at Mays Chapel Elementary School in Timonium, Md.",bdc258e3-5b74-5e72-b379-d230d2a1d1bf,N24News/imgs/bdc258e3-5b74-5e72-b379-d230d2a1d1bf.jpg,20
Automobiles,"Cadillac Recalls 51,000 SRX Crossovers for Acceleration Problem",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/02/automobiles/cadillac-recalls-51000-srx-crossovers-for-acceleration-problem.html,"General Motors is recalling almost 51,000 Cadillac SRX crossovers from the 2013 model year because the powertrain might balk when the driver wants to accelerate, the automaker informed the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in a report posted Thursday on the agency's website.

The automaker said that a problem with the transmission control module could cause a three- to four-second lag from when the driver pushes the accelerator to when the 3.6 liter V6 actually moves the vehicle, according to the report. That ""could result in an increased risk of a crash,"" the automaker said.

General Motors said the problem would occur if the transmission upshifts from first to second gear and then the driver quickly brakes, slowing the vehicle to less than five miles per hour, and then accelerates again.

The automaker did not say how it learned of the problem, but promised that information would be supplied to the safety agency within two weeks. It also did not say whether there had been any accidents or injuries related to the defect.

Science,The Young Sun's Outbursts Were Trapped in Blue Crystals From Outer Space,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/30/science/blue-crystals-sun.html,"Much like a toddler throwing a tantrum, the sun was exceptionally explosive early in its life. It kicked and screamed with ferocious flares and rambunctious bursts of radiation that were much more energetic than what we see today. Astronomers believed the sun went through something like the ""terrible twos"" based on observations of young stars far away in space. But they lacked physical clues of what our star was like in the early years after it formed some 4.6 billion years ago. Now, by studying blue crystals trapped inside a meteorite that predates the planets, researchers have collected what they say is the first direct evidence of the sun's activity during its fiery start. The findings were published Monday in the journal Nature Astronomy. ""This is essentially a real record of the early active sun,"" said Philipp Heck, a cosmochemist at the Field Museum in Chicago and the University of Chicago, and an author on the paper.

[Sign up to get reminders for space and astronomy events on your calendar.] The researchers studied the Murchison meteorite, which had crashed in Australia in 1969. Embedded inside it were microscopic blue space crystals, called hibonites, which are thought to be among the first minerals that formed in the solar system. ""Since its fall it has been a treasure trove for science because it contains so much unaltered material from the very early solar system, like these hibonites,"" said Dr. Heck. The sun during that period was surrounded by a rotating disc of dust and gas that would eventually birth the planets. The center region of the disk was very hot, about 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, making that area about three times as hot as Venus, the hottest planet in the solar system. The hibonites formed in space rocks as the disc cooled. And these rocks were located farther from the sun than Earth is today, according to Dr. Heck. Although the age of the blue hibonites in the Murchison meteorite has not been directly determined, their composition suggests they may have been present during a period that stretches from when the sun was as young as a few hundreds of thousands of years old to as old as about 50 million years, when Earth formed.

Levke Koop, a cosmochemist at the University of Chicago and lead author of the paper, took samples from the meteorite to a mass spectrometer at the Institute of Geochemistry and Petrology, at ETH Zurich, a university in Switzerland. Using an infrared laser they melted the hibonites to release the gases trapped inside. The team found that the cerulean time capsules contained isotopes of neon and helium. These noble gases, trapped inside the hibonites for more than 4.5 billion years, provide clues to the young sun's violent behavior.

""By finding helium and neon we can say that the mineral itself was irradiated,"" said Dr. Koop. ""The sun was actually much more active in the early days than it was today."" Hibonite crystals are rich in calcium and aluminum. As the young sun spewed bursts of radiation into space, the protons collided with these elements in the crystal, splitting them into neon and helium. ""It would be like watching cosmic fireworks,"" said Dr. Heck. ""These eruptions resulted in a stream of charged particles going into different directions irradiating anything in its way."" Dr. Heck said that this phase of irradiation has not been seen in younger meteorites that have fallen to Earth, or on Earth rocks or moon rocks, further indicating the sun's activity slowed down at some point. Right now the sun is about halfway through its life cycle. That means that humanity can look forward to another 4 billion years of relative calm as long as we stick around this solar system. ""Afterward it becomes a red giant and is much less pleasant,"" said Dr. Heck.","Gases trapped inside a meteorite that fell to Earth offer the first physical clues of the ""terrible twos"" phase of our star early in the life of the solar system.",1b644e89-c478-5bed-9e9e-915bec2b3922,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/07/science/31TB-SPACECRYSTAL1/31TB-SPACECRYSTAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e4272806284e441568e6864cf19cf821a83371d9dc0c18f1fdd3689c066d5b27&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Microscopic hibonite crystals found inside a meteorite that crashed in 1969 in Australia are a ""a real record of the early active sun.""",1b644e89-c478-5bed-9e9e-915bec2b3922,N24News/imgs/1b644e89-c478-5bed-9e9e-915bec2b3922.jpg,2
Technology,Google's Pixel 2 Smartphone Is a Powerful Extravagance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/17/technology/personaltech/googles-pixel-2-smartphone-is-a-powerful-extravagance.html,"The last smartphone I reviewed was the original Apple iPhone, which ushered in the mobile revolution back in 2007. At the time, I didn't exactly give the device a rave. Two weeks after waiting in line for hours outside the San Francisco Apple Store and paying $540 for the iPhone, I even returned it and got my money back. It was obvious to me that the iPhone was a powerful thing and everyone -- from Steve Jobs, Apple's co-founder, right down to the people I passed on the street -- kept telling me how great it was. But it was also an extravagance. The iPhone wouldn't really justify its $500-plus cost for another year. Ten years on, I'm now reviewing the Pixel 2, the new flagship phone from Google that goes on sale Thursday. And my take is pretty much the same: People who want the latest and greatest phones won't be disappointed by the Pixel. But for most of us, this device, with a starting price of $649, is an extravagance. Google has found tremendous success convincing the world that it should prefer smartphones that run Android, its mobile operating system, which dominates global market share over Apple. But Google has had much less success designing and selling its own phones.

It is not for a lack of trying. Last fall, the company's campaign reached a new peak with the arrival of the original Pixel. According to reviewers who were hipper, more experienced and less cynical than I, the Pixel was superior to the iPhone -- a stance that amounts to sacrilege in certain circles. Now comes the Pixel 2. After testing the gadget for nearly a week, I found I prefer it to the iPhone -- though this is mostly because I have always carried Android phones. Android is what I'm used to, and all my digital data is stored with Google, even though my daughters think I'm silly for not buying an iPhone. Compared with other Android devices, the Pixel 2 XL, the model I tested and the larger of the two versions of the device, was also a big improvement. I own a Samsung Galaxy S7, widely considered the best Android phone on the market a year ago when it went on sale. I liked that the Pixel 2 XL's fingerprint reader, which instantly unlocks the phone, sat on the back of the device, not far from where my finger typically sits. I liked that the phone arrived with only a small number of essential apps, rather than the sea of flotsam that typically ships with Samsung phones. And I liked that, as my 13-year-old Snapchat-astic daughter said, ""the camera is definitely better.""

Yet is any of this all that different from other top-of-the-line phones? Not really. And Google knows this. Even the steep $849 pricing for the Pixel 2 XL was in line with rivals. In pitching the new Pixel, the company focused on the Google Assistant -- Android's answer to Siri -- and other services that lean on what is commonly called artificial intelligence. This included Google Lens, a service that instantly identifies landmarks, books, movies and other stuff you capture in photos, as well as a service that, in similar fashion, automatically identifies songs playing on a nearby radio or television. These were certainly the most impressive parts of the new phone. And they showed how recent advances in machine learning are producing consumer devices, cars and robots that can read, analyze and respond to their environment in ways that were not possible just a few years ago. Drawing on work by DeepMind, an A.I. lab in Britain that Google acquired in 2014, for instance, the Google Assistant now speaks with a voice that's closer to your own. ""It sounds more normal,"" my 13-year-old said. Still, she added that the improvement was small. That sums up all these services. Many are technically impressive, and some are useful. But they took the Pixel only so far past the status quo. Google Lens gave my 9-year-old several minutes of fun over the weekend. But it's not something she -- or I -- would use on a regular basis. (And it mistook a picture in my bedroom of New York's Flatiron Building for the Empire State Building.)

The service that identifies songs was even more fun and more useful. But it will never be anything more than a tiny part of our daily lives. And it mistakenly identified the musical score at the end of ""The Spy Who Came In From the Cold"" as the song ""Chained"" by the pop group the xx. The Google Assistant was the most adept of all the digital assistants, easily beating Siri and Amazon's Alexa. My younger daughter loved it. (At one point, she said it was more fun than me.) But like those other assistants, it could not deal with more than just a handful of simple tasks, typically delivering web pages or preset answers in response to questions. When I asked the Assistant whether $824 was expensive for a smartphone, it gave me a YouTube video of a guy unboxing some sort of $20,000 monstrosity. In most cases, it can recognize what you say. But it cannot necessarily understand what you say and respond in a completely satisfying way. That is still to come. Google boasts that you can instantly switch the Assistant into a mode that lets you type questions rather than ask them orally. But as my wife said, these assistants are useful only because they let you handle basic tasks -- like sending a text or setting an alarm -- without typing. If I wanted to type, I would just visit google.com. Still, after a few days, I was rather attached to the Pixel 2 XL. On the way to dinner on Saturday night, it correctly identified every song that played on the local 1980s station, from ""The Warrior"" to ""Der Kommissar."" Even so, I plan to keep the $849 for now. The smaller version of the new Pixel goes for $649, and I might go for that, when I finally need a new phone.","Google's new Pixel 2 phone is clearly impressive, according to our reviewer. But whether that makes the device worth buying is another matter.",495faaca-8e2b-5c02-b2ff-95058fab148d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/17/business/18PIXEL-1/18PIXEL-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=7935701a5a3edf8d3d8884c21b7d175f3d62e94c0517478b5b486b150397e439&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Pixel 2, the new flagship phone from Google that goes on sale Thursday.",495faaca-8e2b-5c02-b2ff-95058fab148d,N24News/imgs/495faaca-8e2b-5c02-b2ff-95058fab148d.jpg,20
Food,Sell By? Use By? Grocery Industry Moves to Simplify Labels,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/dining/grocery-food-labels.html,"At a Gristedes supermarket on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, packages of Sabra Supremely Spicy Hummus are stamped with ""best before"" dates, while one shelf up, Tribe Forty Spices Hummus sports a ""use by"" date. Across the aisle, packages of meat are dated with language like ""best by"" and ""best before.""

That is because each food company determines for itself how long a shelf life its products should have, and how to communicate that to shoppers. More than 10 different phrases are used to inform consumers about when to use or discard food, according to the Grocery Manufacturers Association and the Food Marketing Institute, the two large trade groups that represent major food producers and grocery chains. As a result, many people are confused about exactly when to throw out food.

On Wednesday, those two groups, and Walmart, announced that they had agreed to whittle that lexicon to just two phrases: ""best if used by"" and ""use by.""","To reduce needless waste and end confusion over differing language, two food industry trade groups and Walmart have agreed on only two basic labels.",770ae753-5746-59e3-a350-d7c9b27c9501,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/15/dining/15Label/15Label-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fea9c0e28e6f45c9c605b1641c0607aba91678040b09d196dbb462fc68f3c638&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The label on a package of pork chops used a ""sell by"" date on it.

Serebrennikov, the artistic director of the Gogol Center, whose case has raised alarms about repression of artistic freedom in Russia.

Mr. Serebrennikov is accused of embezzling government funds that had been allocated for one of his theatrical projects. The ruling means he will spend another three months under house arrest while awaiting trial.

Earlier this month, investigators reportedly elevated their accusations against Mr. Serebrennikov in a draft of an indictment, saying his theater company, Seventh Studio, had embezzled almost twice as much as they had initially suspected. He and his associates are now accused of stealing the ruble equivalent of $2.3 million.

The Ministry of Culture has been recognized as an injured party in the case, and has asked to be awarded the same sum as compensation if Mr. Serebrennikov is convicted.",Kirill S.

Travel,"In Undiscovered Paterson, Falls, Food and Fetty Wap",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/travel/discovering-paterson-new-jersey.html,"""paterson is not a task like milton going down to hell, it's a flower to the mind"" - Allen Ginsberg in a letter to William Carlos Williams For a kid growing up in Jersey City, nearby Paterson, N.J., was the country. When I was a teenager, my friends and I would drive to Lambert Castle in my boyfriend's Ford and hike around wooded Garret Mountain overlooking the city. And then there were the Great Falls. Standing over them and feeling their spray on my face, their thunder drowning out our laughter, and eyeing that drop into the abyss was as close to heaven and hell as I'd ever come. People from Jersey City weren't used to such displays of natural power and beauty. The most amazing part was that these massive waterfalls were in the middle of an industrial city, just a few towns away from my own industrial city.

and crashes from the edge of the gorge in a recoil of spray and rainbow mists -- Back then I hadn't yet read those lines in the epic poem ""Paterson"" by William Carlos Williams, the pediatrician-poet who lived a short drive away and made house calls in the city. I didn't know Paterson's sweeping history, didn't know it was founded by Alexander Hamilton because of the falls. I didn't realize that Philippe Petit had, just a few weeks after walking between the Twin Towers in 1974, stretched his high wire above Paterson's swirling chasm and made his way across, as 30,000 people looked on, gasping. I had only just discovered the howling of Paterson's native son, the poet Allen Ginsberg, and was about to read Jack Kerouac's ""On the Road,"" whose main character, Sal Paradise, lives for a time with his aunt in Paterson. And who could have predicted that the director Jim Jarmusch would write his own indie-film love poem to the falls, the city and to poetry itself, released earlier this year? But the primeval roar of Paterson's waters told me that something special resided here -- some magnet that had drawn me and thousands of others to it, a psychic force bigger than my own teenage psyche. I forgot about the city as I traveled the rest of the wide world. I cheated on Paterson with a visit to Niagara, a drive across the country, then moved on to other countries and continents. But when I had my own kids, always on the lookout for fun day trips, I brought them to Paterson to see what I had seen. There they were, the falls, right where I had left them, quite a spectacle for the eyes of a 7- and 4-year-old. And a 41-year-old.

thru Paterson, and the West, and Europe and here again...fire escapes That's when I stumbled upon some of Paterson's other precious gems: Libby's Lunch, a Texas-wiener-style hot dog shack right across from the falls. Libby's, supposedly there since 1936, may be older than anyone remembers. While doing work in the basement recently, the owner's son came across paper delivery bags stamped with the Libby's name and the year, 1916. Around the corner was Paterson's jewel of a museum - located in the restored Thomas Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works shop - tracing the city's industrial history; big black locomotives were parked out front and Wright Aeronautical Company airplane parts sat inside -- a thrill for my small son. Now that he's at college, I take my two-year-old nephew to see the antique fire trucks, Lenape Indian statues and locomotives. The motor of Lindbergh's Spirit of St. Louis was made in Paterson, as were the sails for the first America's Cup yacht race. Because it was such an industrial center and important union town, Paterson was a regular campaign stop for presidential candidates: everyone from Dwight Eisenhower to Ronald Reagan. Even Bill Clinton stopped in to campaign for Hillary last year. But Paterson has seen the worst of American history as well as its best. Boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, immortalized in the Denzel Washington film and in Bob Dylan's song, grew up on its streets and was falsely accused of a triple homicide committed in one of its local bars. Six of the 9/11 hijackers lived in an apartment in Paterson before their attacks, not far from the falls. Two of its recent mayors have been indicted.

Hamilton picnicked atop the falls in 1778 with George Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette, feasting on cold ham, tongue, large biscuits and grog, and was inspired to build the country's first planned industrial city in 1792, harnessing the energy from its waters. Paterson's paper mills, textile mills, breweries, Colt factories and in particular silk mills - earning Paterson the nickname Silk City -- employed wave after wave of poor immigrants. The Germans, Dutch and Irish were followed by Eastern Europeans and Italians (including the family of Lou Costello, who changed his Calabrian name from Cristillo. He now has his own statue at Cianci Park, not far from the falls, holding a baseball bat in a nod to his Who's on First routine). Paterson, the state's third largest city after Newark and my rapidly gentrifying hometown Jersey City, is now home to 147,000 people from 52 different ethnic groups, including Puerto Ricans, Dominicans, Africans, Bangladeshis, Caribbean islanders, Middle Easterners and Peruvians. Thanks to those immigrants, Paterson has some of the best restaurants in the state. One of my favorites is Griselda's, a Peruvian spot in a neighborhood dubbed Little Lima. Griselda's gets packed for lunch and serves great jalea (deep fried seafood) and chaufa (fried rice), though I haven't been brave enough to try its guinea pig stew. Across town in South Paterson - known as Little Ramallah -- is Al Basha, a Palestinian/Lebanese restaurant that serves warm pita with authentic labne, kebabs and stewed lamb.

Six years ago, the latest settlers arrived: the National Park Service. They now run tours of the falls, giving the landmark a legitimacy that it lacked before, working with the city and state on refurbishing the areas surrounding the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park. Since Hamilton became a rock star, Hamilton-heads have been making pilgrimages to that picnic spot and his statue overlooking the falls. The gift shop at the visitors center now sells Hamilton books, banks, hand warmers and the Broadway cast album. ""There has always been industry here,"" said Robert Veronelli, who runs the visitors center. ""But the only industry left now is tourism."" On a weekday visit in spring, I was the only person on an official tour of the falls, but Mr. Veronelli said more than 300 tourists passed through on summer weekends, not just visitors from other parts of New Jersey but from as far as Texas and Arizona.

When I was there, several people were milling about the falls on their own, including a young couple. Joshua Ortiz, who grew up next door in Clifton, had been here many times, but his friend, Shannon Klemm, never had. ""It's so gorgeous,"" said Ms. Klemm, shaking her head and looking over the stone wall at the falls, the second largest by volume east of the Mississippi after Niagara. They had come because they were both ""Sopranos"" fans. In one episode of the HBO series, hit men throw someone into the falls from the arched iron footbridge. My guide, park ranger Ilyse Goldman, countered that on most sunny days you can see a rainbow from that same bridge because of the falls' spray. I have never been so lucky. The latest boon to the town's tourism is the film, ""Paterson,"" by Mr. Jarmusch, which was nominated for the Palm d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last year. The movie is about a poet/bus driver named Paterson, played by Adam Driver, who is inspired by the falls. Mr. Driver quotes Mr. Williams in the film, the perfect poem about the plums in the ice box. And ""Paterson,"" Mr. Williams' epic paean to the city, is one of the dog-eared books on the character's writing desk. Books will give rest sometimes against Movie fans often stop in at the Paterson Museum to ask if the nearby bus depot is the same one used in the film. Indeed it is, answers the museum director Giacomo DiStefano, who was born and raised. ""Why isn't the museum in the film?"" they ask. ""If the Paterson character worked across the street, wouldn't he come and visit?"" Mr. DiStefano explains that the character doesn't really exist.

Mr. Jarmusch's movie is a draw for out-of-towners, but Paterson's most recent favorite son and homegrown poet is rapper Fetty Wap -- 26-year-old Willie Maxwell II, who grew up in the Fourth Ward neighborhood. Mr. Maxwell's 2014 runaway hit single ""Trap Queen"" references trap music, known for its synthesized, complicated beats and gritty lyrics that both celebrate and lament inner-city life. Mr. Maxwell recorded a music video last year for another single, ""Wake Up,"" featuring marijuana and a stripper, not unusual subject matter for a music video. But it was filmed in Paterson's Eastside High School, which Mr. Maxwell once attended. At the end of ""Wake Up,"" a tattooed woman takes an apple off the teacher's desk and uses it as a pot pipe. Paterson officials were not amused and launched an investigation last year into how a stripper pole and platform made it into the school. A principal took the fall and was suspended, and the approval process for filming on school property has now been tightened. If he were still alive, Paterson poet Ginsberg probably would have appreciated Mr. Maxwell's work. When he returned home to Paterson in 1966 for a poetry reading, Mr. Ginsberg told the crowd that he had just smoked pot at the falls to better appreciate their beauty. The mayor told the police to issue a warrant for his arrest. So Mr. Ginsberg didn't make a public appearance in Paterson for another 14 years. Unlike Mr. Ginsberg, Mr. Maxwell has remained a strong presence in his hometown, distributing turkeys at Thanksgiving and hanging out in the neighborhood. And if it's all good it's all good, I'ma rep my 'hood, ayy Paterson today is not just rough around the edges, but throughout; gang violence and drug deals are common, its smokestacks dormant, bail bond shops numerous and the banks of the Passaic dotted with tents from the homeless living where the Lenape once fished. On my most recent drive there, I heard on the radio that a spotted Savannah cat someone was keeping as a pet had been set loose on the city streets. Thankfully it was caught before I got out of my car. The large, spotted cat slinking past littered streets and aluminum sided homes, was like something one of the city's poets might include in a line. The wild power of nature bumping up against the industrial landscape that was once America.","The New Jersey city was famous for industry.

Global Business,Confidence From Chief of SoftBank in Sprint Bid,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/business/global/confidence-from-chief-of-softbank-in-sprint-bid.html,"TOKYO -- In 2005, SoftBank was in dire straits. The scrappy Internet services company had booked a $1 billion loss the previous year, its largest ever. A campaign to enter Japan's strictly regulated cellphone business had failed. Its share price, which had soared with the Internet bubble, had fallen to less than a tenth of its height in 2000. But the next move by Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder and chief executive, astounded corporate Japan. Mr. Son plunged deeper into debt to acquire Vodafone's Japanese cellphone unit for about $15 billion -- Japan's largest leveraged buyout at the time -- to muscle his way into the mobile market. SoftBank is now one of Japan's biggest companies -- its market capitalization is three times that of Sony's -- and Mr. Son is confident that his plan to break into the American mobile market with a $21.6 billion bid to buy Sprint will be easy. ""We've fought far tougher battles than this,"" Mr. Son told investors on Friday in Tokyo at SoftBank's annual general meeting. Hours earlier, a rival bidder for Sprint had confirmed it was ending its pursuit of the mobile network, America's third-largest. ""It's just been so much easier this time round,"" he said.

Most analysts agree that Mr. Son, who seems set to acquire Sprint along with its Clearwire unit, faces long odds as he seeks to compete in the American mobile market. But his record for taking on giant companies -- and coming out on top -- bodes well for his chances, they say. ""Mr. Son is simply the most talented and audacious businessman Japan has ever produced,"" said Kazuo Noda, chairman of the Japan Research Institute. ""And when he goes into a new market, he doesn't just take on the big guys. He changes all the rules."" It is Mr. Son's background as an outsider in Japanese society that makes him so willing to take risks, people who know him say, including Mr. Noda, who first met Mr. Son, then a college graduate, three decades ago. A third-generation Korean-Japanese, a minority group that still faces discrimination in Japan, Mr. Son has spoken of his roots in a slum on the southern island of Kyushu. But after his family's fortunes improved, he made his way to the United States. At high school and then at college in California, Mr. Son was dazzled by an entrepreneurial culture that he said he felt had been lost in Japan. And most of all, he was persuaded the world was about to experience a revolution in information technology.

Mr. Son founded SoftBank in 1981 first as a publisher of computer magazines, then as a successful distributor of computer software. Using money from that business, Mr. Son made a series of investments in the early 1990s, including a one-third stake in what was then a little-known American start-up named Yahoo. That bet paid off, giving Mr. Son money to expand his empire as Yahoo's share price climbed.
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday.
* The high cost of gas is forcing families to cut back on activities and essentials.
* Clearview AI does well in another round of facial recognition accuracy tests. But Mr. Son burst into the big leagues in the 2000s, buying a stake in a bankrupt bank, a small telecommunications company, a baseball team and a part of Alibaba of China, now the world's largest e-commerce company When SoftBank began offering fast DSL Internet service in Japan in 2001, it took on losses to undercut competitors' prices by half. Government officials fretted that the price war would cripple the entire market. But consumers loved the sharp fall in prices, and the DSL market grew almost thirtyfold in two years. Around that time, Mr. Son also started pushing the Japanese government to let SoftBank into the country's highly regulated mobile sector, dominated by NTT DoCoMo, a subsidiary of the former state telecommunications monopoly. When his demands were snubbed, Mr. Son took the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications to court, accusing it of colluding with NTT to shut out competition. The ministry eventually agreed to talks, but ultimately gave SoftBank a license to an inferior spectrum. Mr. Son, furious, turned to Plan B. In March 2006, SoftBank announced it would acquire Vodafone's struggling Japanese unit, borrowing 1.2 trillion yen ($10.3 billion at the time) to finance the purchase. A day later, Mr. Son returned his original license to the government. His bets since then have been as bold. He brought the iPhone to Japan, using aggressive marketing to sell a handset most analysts said would not do well there because of its simplicity. Since then, the iPhone has become Japan's best-selling phone. And underscoring his doggedness, Mr. Son confirmed that SoftBank considered other options in case the Sprint deal fell through, including buying T-Mobile, America's fourth-largest carrier, majority owned by Deutsche Telekom.

Now his doubters and his fans are watching the battle for Sprint. Mr. Son ""will go down in corporate history, but only if he doesn't stumble with his big bet on Sprint,"" said Tadashi Yanai, founder and chief of Fast Retailing, which sells the Uniqlo brand of clothes, and an external board member at SoftBank. SoftBank's bid for Sprint, if it goes through, will be Japan's largest-ever overseas acquisition. Dish Network, the satellite TV company, threw a wrench into the deal with a rival offer. To clinch the deal, Mr. Son raised his bid, while reducing the amount of capital it would inject into Sprint, raising concerns among some analysts that the move would hurt the American carrier's capacity to invest in network infrastructure. Mr. Son defended that move on Friday, saying the acquisition would generate annual savings of $2 billion over the next four years. But Softbank is also paying dearly for the acquisition. It will use proceeds from recent bond sales, including a $4.1 billion issuance that closed Wednesday in Japan's biggest retail offering by a nonfinancial company, to finance the deal. Mr. Son said that Sprint, with SoftBank as owner, would get aggressive in pricing handsets and service contracts by using global economies of scale to drive a hard bargain with phone makers. The two companies together sold 26.5 million phones last year, just a step behind Verizon's 28.8 million and AT&T's 26.9 million. He said that unlike Vodafone Japan, Sprint would be a far easier corporate turnaround. Sprint has already been rebounding under Daniel R. Hesse, who reversed its reputation for poor customer service. Mr. Son says he is ready for another big move. ""In tennis, you strike a ball just after the rebound for the fastest return,"" he said. ""It's the same with investment.""","Most analysts agree that SoftBank faces long odds as it seeks to compete in the American mobile market, but the company's chief has been successful in taking on giant companies — and coming out on top.",3e27a13b-a6e3-5cf5-9920-1ae80beacdb7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/22/business/Softbank/Softbank-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=2f46c533316f117dbc7e7447eb13b0268fc6bbf32a26db072e0b53d0eb5b83b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Masayoshi Son, SoftBank's founder and chief, has a track record in Japan for taking on giant companies and succeeding.",3e27a13b-a6e3-5cf5-9920-1ae80beacdb7,N24News/imgs/3e27a13b-a6e3-5cf5-9920-1ae80beacdb7.jpg,24
Food,Pok Pok Ny to Close After 6 Years,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/13/dining/pok-pok-ny-closing.html,"After more than six years in Brooklyn, Pok Pok Ny will be closing on Sept. 2, according to the chef and restaurateur Andy Ricker, who also has six restaurants in Portland, Ore.

Mr. Ricker cited several reasons for the decision: The restaurant's lease came up for renewal. And though the landlord was willing to negotiate, Mr. Ricker said, it didn't make sense in the face of decreasing revenues and rising expenses. His general manager, Valerie Dozier, is switching careers to film and leaving the restaurant. And, the Columbia Street waterfront district, the restaurant's neighborhood, has not become ""a hub of activity despite years of positive predictions,"" as he put it.

He says he also feels that, compared with when he first opened Pok Pok Ny, the city's Thai food scene has developed nicely, with places like Uncle Boons, Somtum Der and Ugly Baby, making his restaurant one of many.

Health,"A Flu Epidemic That Threatens Birds, Not Humans",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/05/health/a-flu-epidemic-that-threatens-birds-not-humans.html,"Although much of the country has barely noticed, avian influenza -- a version of the virus that generated ""Killer Bird Flu!"" headlines a decade ago -- is now sweeping the Midwest. More than 20 million turkeys and chickens have died or been culled; Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin have declared states of emergency; and teams of experts are trying to figure out how the new virus is spreading. No humans have caught this flu, but health officials fear they might. They are requiring that cullers and barn-cleaners wear the kind of protective gear that Ebola workers do. Officials have also advised that everyone who was recently in contact with affected poultry operations -- workers, truckers, veterinarians and so on -- take Tamiflu, a flu preventive.

No one knows how lethal any of the new viruses might be to humans. But because the virus spreading in the Midwest can wipe out most of a flock in two days, all are assumed to be dangerous. The authorities are preparing for the panic that may ensue if someone catches one of these viruses and dies. Still, officials, say, most Americans are in little danger. The overall risks pale compared with those posed by well-known mortal threats that elicit no panic: car crashes, bee stings, bathroom falls and so on. ""We deem this a low human health risk -- low, but not zero,"" said Dr. Anne Schuchat, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""So far, we don't have worrisome signs. But we don't want to be overly reassuring, because with influenza, we always take events quite seriously.""

The three flu viruses found recently in American birds are an H5N8, an H5N2 and a new H5N1. The new H5N1 virus has been found only in three wild birds in Washington State. The H5N8 virus, moving south from Canada in December, infected a few poultry farms in California and Idaho but has not been reported recently. The H5N2 virus, however, is spreading rapidly in Midwest poultry operations and is the largest such outbreak in North American history. The lethal ancestor of all three viruses, the Asian H5N1, was first identified in 1997 when it killed six people in Hong Kong. To stop it, every chicken in the territory was slaughtered, and poultry imports from China were banned. The virus disappeared, although experts assume it circulated in China without being reported. It re-emerged in Hong Kong in 2003 and has spread to Asia, Europe and Africa.

It has killed people in Indonesia, Egypt, Vietnam, Cambodia, China and elsewhere -- most of whom had contact with live poultry, often in backyard flocks. A few infections appear to have been transmitted within families after one member nursed another. That Asian virus has never been found in the Western Hemisphere. But the flu viruses spreading here now contain some of its genes, including those for the H -- for hemagglutinin -- ""spike"" it uses to attach to cells.

The H5N8 virus is thought to have emerged before 2014, when Asian H5N1 mixed with a milder duck flu in China with a different ""N"" gene. (""N"" stands for neuraminidase, the protein ""helicopter blade"" that chops away receptors on a cell's surface so virus particles can escape. There are 18 H shapes and 11 N shapes, and each virus has six other genes that also determine its lethality.) That H5N8 spread to Japan, Russia and Europe before turning up in Canada. The H5N2 and the new H5N1 have some North American genes and so clearly emerged on this continent more recently -- presumably when the H5N8 virus finally arrived and crossed with North American strains.

That may have happened last summer. Migratory ducks, geese and swans from around the world share ponds in the Arctic in summer. New flu gene mixes emerge and move south along the various migratory paths taken by the birds. Whatever the mix of genes, dose size is also important in determining spread of the virus, said Dr. Peter Palese, a flu expert at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine. Human flus can infect people who inhale only one to 10 virus particles, he said, but it takes 100,000 to 1 million particles of an H5 bird flu to infect a human. ""That's why people who sleep under their chickens in markets in Asia get it, and we don't get it on Fifth Avenue,"" Dr. Palese said.

In birds, flu is primarily an intestinal disease rather than a respiratory one, so cullers and cleaners are told to wear coveralls, face masks and goggles to prevent any barn dust -- much of which is powdered feces -- from entering their noses, mouths or eyes. Dr. Palese says he believes they should wear the full hoods with battery-powered air filters used in biosafety Level 3 laboratories. Officials, he said, should also consider giving them the vaccines developed years ago against H5N1. Although it would not be a perfect match, it might provide some protection. Several million doses of an experimental vaccine are in the National Strategic Stockpile, said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases.

The agency has also begun work on a vaccine against the new H5N8 virus, Dr. Schuchat said, and can make one against H5N2 virus, as well. But producing it in large quantities can take months or even a year. To cull birds, farm operators normally cover them with a suffocating carbon dioxide foam. As they decompose, said Henry L. Niman, a biochemist in Pittsburgh who tracks genetic changes in flus, the heat generated kills the virus and the carcasses can be used as compost. But that stops poultry production in the barn for weeks. Other methods include incineration in portable kilns, and burial, though each have drawbacks. With burial, rotting birds could end up in the water table; with incineration, infectious feathers or other particles could blow up the stack and into the wind.",An avian virus related to one that has killed 440 people in Asia is cutting through the Midwest.

Fashion & Style,An Emergency Marriage License Erases Boundaries,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/17/fashion/weddings/an-emergency-marriage-license-erases-boundaries.html,"As a gay couple, Suneel Khanna and Carl Wolter are accustomed to questioning boundaries when it comes to love. But before they got married in Toronto on June 14, the geographical kind were new to them. Mr. Khanna (left), 45, and Mr. Wolter, 65, met on the dating app Growlr in April 2018. Mr. Wolter, a social worker, lived in Palm Springs, Calif. Mr. Khanna had recently left his job in public relations in Toronto for a yearlong sabbatical. Part of that sabbatical found him in Palm Springs, at an Airbnb. He and Mr. Wolter had their first date there. ""I was captivated,"" Mr. Wolter said. A romance with what both thought would be a four-week expiration date began; Mr. Khanna was due back in Canada. But when he left, they couldn't let go. ""You name the platform -- video chatting, texting -- we were on it,"" Mr. Khana said.

A little more than a year later, after a return trip to Palm Springs by Mr. Khanna and a vacation together in Mexico, Mr. Wolter packed his cat for an open-ended visit to Toronto. ""He was coming to spend more time with me,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""We weren't really sure how it would go."" But both the cat and Mr. Wolter adapted quickly, and in June 2019, they moved in.

""It had become like, when we weren't together we were counting down the sleeps until we could be together again,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""We fit into each other's lives in a very uncomplicated, undramatic way."" At a friend's 2019 New Year's Eve party, Mr. Khanna proposed. ""Suneel made it incredibly romantic,"" Mr. Wolter said. He did so by enlisting seven friends to read aloud a chapter each of a relationship history he had written. ""Carl said yes 10 seconds before midnight,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""There wasn't a dry eye in the house."" When Covid emerged, Mr. Khanna and Mr. Wolter were in the midst of planning a Toronto wedding for 80 that was to include guests from India, where Mr. Khanna still has family, as well as Switzerland and Palm Springs. By the end of March, they canceled. Mr. Wolter, an American, started feeling vulnerable. The border to the United States had closed, which meant he couldn't legally come back if he went home to see his ailing father in Iowa. And in order for him to work in Canada, he needed to be married to a Canadian. The couple pleaded for an emergency marriage license. Toronto's City Hall granted one. On June 14, Mr. Khanna and Mr. Wolter were married in a Hindu-Anglican ceremony at the Royal York, a Toronto hotel. Mr. Wolter read First Corinthians. Mr. Khanna's father, Jyoti Khanna, sang a Hindu peace prayer. Both grooms wore traditional Indian wedding costumes, glittering turbans included, sewn in India for the original ceremony. Instead of the five guests they had planned for, 10 attended; two days before the wedding, Canada loosened its restrictions to allow that many.

Mr. Khanna's mother, Chander Khanna, and father are in their 80s and had been afraid to leave their Toronto home because of the virus. But the hotel gave them the red-carpet treatment: ""They parked a car out front and took the elevator straight up to the ballroom,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""They didn't even have to press a button."" For the grooms, the intimate ceremony felt like a triumph on a couple of levels. ""There was an irony to having gotten to this point in our lives, after having fought for gay marriage, that our wedding would be during a time of shutdowns and closures,"" Mr. Khanna said. ""But we did it, and it was joyous. And glamorous.""",Suneel Khanna and Carl Wolter were captivated from the start. But a closing of the U.S.-Canadian put their wedding at risk.,e5b30432-1afa-5cc1-83ff-c3e234a0b02a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/fashion/19Khanna-02/19Khanna-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=08899c06c32055f48108cc49c974504a519ce6508a05f33752a42d99bf1a8208&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Suneel Khanna, left, and Carl Wolter.",e5b30432-1afa-5cc1-83ff-c3e234a0b02a,N24News/imgs/e5b30432-1afa-5cc1-83ff-c3e234a0b02a.jpg,19
Travel,Hollywood Gets Its Groove Back,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/travel/hollywood-gets-its-groove-back.html,"Hollywood's grande dame hotels, the Sunset Tower and the Chateau Marmont, stand like stone sentries on Sunset Boulevard, less than two miles from the decidedly less stylish stretch of Hollywood Boulevard that hustles from morning to night with camera-toting tourists and Spiderman and Batman impersonators. The Tower and the Chateau are as romantic, seductive and happening as ever, at once guardians of an imperiled history but very much of the moment, with deal-making lunches and opening parties drawing clumps of paparazzi outside the driveway of Chateau Marmont, and limousines backed up along Sunset Boulevard in front of the Sunset Tower. Above Sunset Boulevard, there is a maze of narrow, curvy roads cutting through the legendary heart of the Hollywood Hills, each turn revealing another home, sky-high hedge, view of the Hollywood sign and, on a good day, a glimpse of the Pacific Ocean in the distance. A few miles away, you really can run into Natalie Portman picking through vegetables at the beguiling Hollywood Farmers' Market, as I did one recent Sunday -- which, of course, is part of the draw. ""Let's go say hello to Justin Timberlake!"" Andrew Williams, a bubbly tour leader for Starline Tours, shouted as he hung a right turn off Mulholland Drive, the Los Angeles basin to our right, before heading up the cul-de-sac where Mr. Timberlake lives, marked by a guard house with darkened windows -- and three bins from the Department of Public Works: blue for recycling, green for garden debris and brown for garbage. ""Justin Timberlake has trash, too,"" Mr. Williams exclaimed to the 12 people sitting in the back of his van. In the 1950s Frank Sinatra and Ava Gardner, right, could be spotted at Ciro's nightclub on the Sunset Strip. There was a time when visiting Hollywood was a glance-at-your-guidebook kind of adventure. The corner of Hollywood and Vine. The studio tour. The open-air van ride through Beverly Hills to gape at the famous mansions of celebrities (or at least the gates and hedges blocking some supposedly famous mansions). With any luck, you might find yourself behind a rope on Hollywood Boulevard, watching the flash-and-dash red carpet arrivals at a gala movie opening.

But Hollywood today is not the place it was 50 years ago, even as it prepares to celebrate itself next Sunday with the 87th Academy Awards presentation. Movies and television shows are as likely to be produced on the streets of Toronto or Queens as on the back lots of a Hollywood studio. There are as many star-studded premieres at the Ziegfeld Theater in Manhattan as there are at El Capitan in Hollywood. The corner of Hollywood and Vine is, for all its celebration in song and screen, really just a street corner -- anchored by a Starbucks, no less. Many handsome Hollywood neighborhoods that recall a gilded age of Hollywood -- the noirish apartment buildings where, say, Marilyn Monroe once lived or which provided the backdrop for classics like Sunset Boulevard -- are now shoulder-to-shoulder with bland apartment complexes and shopping centers, assuming they haven't been knocked down completely. And hurray for Hollywood Boulevard for making something of a comeback, cleaning up nicely with spruced-up sidewalks and streetlights, but it's still not Times Square: Even with the dope dealers and prostitutes chased out, it can still feel a little cheesy and a little seedy. ""People love to take tours of Hollywood, and go to Grauman's Chinese theater -- TCL Chinese Theater -- and all that stuff; it was all part of the movie industry when they were having their golden era,"" Robert Osborne, the film historian who began his career working for Lucille Ball, told me as he reminisced about his years here. ""But there is not much of that Hollywood that still exists.""

""It's still a great place to go,"" said Mr. Osborne, who is host of Turner Classic Movies. ""But going to Hollywood today is akin to going to Washington, D.C., because Lincoln once lived there."" Hollywood is not a city, town or village (it is a neighborhood in the city of Los Angeles) but a cultural touchstone for anyone who grew up on movies, for those people for whom Los Angeles really means Hollywood, with its celebrities, mansions, swimming pools, palm tree-lined boulevard and movie studios. Those Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movies that ended with the tag, ""Made in Hollywood USA"" were actually produced on a back lot in Culver City. The Hollywood sign, which draws hundreds of tourists onto the winding canyon roads of Hollywood every day, to the understandable chagrin of people who live there, was put up by Harry Chandler, the visionary Los Angeles Times publisher, to announce the development of elegant homes built on the hill known as Hollywoodland. (The last four letters disappeared long ago.) But that is not to say Hollywood is not worth visiting; it most certainly is, as I can attest living a 15-minute walk from the center of it all. Just keep in mind that, as the film industry has changed, Hollywood as a tourist destination has as well -- less defined and more dispersed, not so much a neat geographical dot on the map as a mind-set, a particularly useful prism through which to explore this vastly interesting city. ""Listen, definitely the Hollywood of the past is gone -- because Hollywood is reinventing itself,"" said Eric M. Garcetti, the mayor of Los Angeles who as a councilman represented Hollywood. ""But I'll tell you, I don't miss the times when it was unsafe to walk on Hollywood Boulevard, when there was nothing there, no tourists, no stars, no people. Chad Ress for The New York Times ""What I like about Hollywood is it stays authentic,"" he told me. Hollywood still is-and-will-always-be the Walk of Fame, the hawkers standing on Sunset Boulevard selling suspect guide maps to celebrity homes, and the Musso & Frank Grill, which seems to have defied all the laws of nature to remain not only in business but worth stopping by for a martini, prime ribs and a celebrity sighting. And it is filled with endearing characters like Mr. Williams, the guide who announced that he had been leading this tour for 25 years, was the son of parents who worked in the industry and (brace yourself) writes screenplays during the day. But Hollywood is also the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, home to the Golden Globes, and the dark and mysteriously romantic Tower Bar in West Hollywood with its view over the glistening Los Angeles basin and where shadowy corners are filled with directors, agents and movie stars. It is the Hollywood Bowl, as splendid an outdoor venue as you'll find anywhere, with its tributes under night skies one evening to John Williams, the prolific American film composer, and to ""Star Wars"" the next, and it is Point Dume in Malibu, scene of countless film shoots. Hollywood is the ArcLight movie complex on Sunset Boulevard, as rewarding a place to see a film as you'll find anywhere; it is where actors and directors who can't afford their own screening room go to see movies. It is even a burial ground: Hollywood Forever is the cemetery-to-the-stars, worth gravestone gawking by day -- Rudolph Valentino, Mickey Rooney, Bugsy Siegel -- and even open at night for movie screenings and concerts by bands like Spoon, whose lead singer, Britt Daniel, has a home up in Beachwood Canyon.

With no real center of gravity, Los Angeles can be baffling for first-time visitors (it's often been remarked that this is a wonderful place to live, but an awfully tough place to visit). It's only slightly less confounding when it comes to Hollywood: There is no end to argument about what the boundaries to Hollywood really are, which leads to some basic challenges for those Hollywood-bound travelers: Where do I go? I typically take out-of-town guests first to the famous stretch of Hollywood Boulevard -- with all its familiar if shopworn touchstones: the Walk of Fame with its 2,500 stars embedded in the sidewalks, the Dolby Theater where the Academy Awards take place, the TCL Chinese Theater, with the handprints of stars and, if you must, the Hollywood Wax Museum. There's a popular outdoor walkway view of the Hollywood sign in the Hollywood and Highland Center, an otherwise unfortunate shopping mall on a site where a hotel once stood, whose construction marked the beginning of a largely successful campaign to scrub an area once known for drug dealers and prostitutes.

There's also the celebrated Capitol Records Building that resembles a stack of records, glimmering with a history that spans Sinatra to the Beatles to Arcade Fire, who performed live on its outdoor patio in 2014. No need to dawdle: Hollywood Boulevard is from morning to night a crush of tourists staring down at the ground (at the stars, rather than at their smartphones). The Hollywood royalty feted here -- the actors and directors and producers -- show up only when they get a star on the sidewalk, a chance to put their hand in cement or when attending the Academy Awards. And they hop right back into their waiting limo when done. And take a tour. I settled on the Starline tour, a lively and informative two-hour whirl through Beverly Hills, Hollywood and West Hollywood. (Stipulated going in: I was going to believe everything that my guide told me.) Who knew that Ringo Starr has a house on Hillcrest Road in Beverly Hills, and with oversize ornamental rings perched on top of his gate, or that showpieces from Jay Leno's antique car collection are easily seen from the road outside his Beverly Hills home? It was also a lesson, if you need it, that celebrity isn't the only fascination that draws so many millions of people here every year. ""Can you smell the wealth yet?"" Mr. Williams asked as we bounced along Sunset Boulevard. ""We are approaching Beverly Hills."" He stopped not once but twice to offer different perspectives of the palatial estate of one movie executive. And, of course, there were the dusty if respectable museum moments: the visits to the former home of Shirley Temple, a place where Elvis Presley lived, the block where the opening of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" was filmed, and the close-to-the-street homes of Al Pacino, Alan Alda and Larry King. As Mr. Osborne, the Turner Classic host, put it: ""There's something kind of exciting looking at the house that Rudolph Valentino lived in, or Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. To be able to go there and step back in time is very exciting."" Not to mention the house where Michael Jackson died, where the new owners have posted a friendly sign out front: ""Warning: Attack Dog on Premises.""

Once that is done, go back on your own. The best way to see Hollywood is to get lost: Drive up into the canyons off Sunset Boulevard or Laurel Canyon Boulevard and turn into any street that grabs your sense of mystery, the narrower the better. Hollywood Boulevard actually continues as a barely two-lane road on the west side of Laurel Canyon Boulevard; follow it until you lose it, which you will. No matter: Los Angeles helpfully posts signs indicating which streets are not through streets, and when lost, just head down the hill. ""There are pockets of Old Hollywood that are still out there,"" said Robert Hofler, a former Variety columnist and author who has written about Hollywood scandal and social life. Particularly at night. ""The darkness helps you blot out the strip malls,"" Mr. Hofler told me from New York, where he lives now. ""When you're driving in the hills at night, it is very easy to think you've entered a Dashiell Hammett or Raymond Chandler novel."" The two survivors that have held hard to the reins of Hollywood's past and present, of course, the Chateau Marmont and the Sunset Tower, are within walking distance of each other in West Hollywood. The hotels have long been in competition to be the town square for Hollywood. You would be well-advised to stay at either one of them (and you would be equally well-advised to check before booking to see if any of the restaurants or pools are off-limits that night for a Hollywood affair; you decide whether that is a draw or a turnoff). The Sunset Tower is an Art Deco treat to the eyes, rising on a bend on Sunset Boulevard. It is where, until recently, Vanity Fair held its Academy Awards party, not that the hotel needed that for its cachet. As my partner, Ben, and I walked up the steps to check in a few days before the Golden Globe Awards, Eddie Redmayne, the raffish British actor, rushed past, accompanied by three assistants, and climbed into a black SUV, presumably on his way to interviews to promote ""The Theory of Everything,"" for which he would receive a best actor award a few days later.

At check-in, one is required to sign a promise not to film or photograph in the hotel without the written permission of the general manager: Celebrities here can be seen but not disturbed. The rooms are off hushed, dark hallways, overlooking the Hollywood Hills on one side, and the pool on another, downtown Los Angeles off in the distance. But the ground floor is where the fun is, subdued and electric at the same time, where Mr. Redmayne could be spotted giving interviews. On the east side is the Tower Bar, with its comfortable warren of tables and always sparkling picture windows opening up to display the Los Angeles landscape. There is a whole other wing on the west side of the lobby, with a bar and restaurant snug up against a pool. Sitting under the stars and looking across the pool, with Los Angeles beyond, is about as pleasant a way to spend an evening as they come, and that is true pretty much year-round. The maitre d', Dmitri Dmitrov, is a kind of Hollywood royalty himself, and observing him operating on a night -- moving from actor to agent to just regular customer -- is as entertaining as standing outside an opening. Against this stiff competition in the glamour-stakes, the Chateau Marmont more than holds its own. Formerly an apartment building, it was turned into a hotel that is a tribute to a Loire Valley castle, with a lush garden that serves as a setting for breakfast or dinner or, at the right time of year, for the opening night party for ""Mad Men"" or the post-Emmy celebrations for Netflix. It is also more, shall we say, snooty. There is a priceless scene in ""The Comeback,"" the HBO series about a fading actress played by Lisa Kudrow, where the maitre d' inadvertently punches Ms. Kudrow in the stomach as he tries, unsuccessfully, to stop her from barging into the garden to pay her respects to a network executive, Andy Cohen of Bravo, having lunch with RuPaul Charles, the drag queen.

There's an easy workaround, if you haven't managed to get a lunch with Mr. Cohen or Mr. Charles: Book one of the rooms in the hotel; they are charming throwbacks to the 1920s. Our room looked west with a view of the Sunset Tower. Or make a reservation in the Restaurant at the Chateau Marmont, as it is known. We stayed over on a Sunday night in December, had a fried chicken dinner and paella. No matter that it was a Sunday right before Christmas: The place was buzzing past midnight. Or even just have a drink off the lobby, glowing with wood beams and couches and chairs arranged in discreet circles, as a piano player tinkles old standards. The room provides a great vantage spot to see who is walking into the restaurant. The pool, secluded even if it is within hearing distance of the buzz of Sunset Boulevard, is where the private cabins are, notably the one where John Belushi died of a drug overdose. A pool attendant volunteered that it is ""absolutely allowed"" to skinny dip in the pool, and if I sauntered back, say, around 4 a.m., I would see people swimming in the buff. (Do not worry: I did not and I did not.) Hollywood is no longer marked by a traveling posse of movie stars who move from night to night to familiar haunts like the old Spago or Dan Tana's: They have been scared off by the rise of the paparazzi and cellphone cameras. And in truth, many celebrities who lived in the Hollywood Hills have moved west to Brentwood and Malibu or (if they are younger) east to Los Feliz and Silver Lake -- or split their time with homes in New York or Montana. ""People don't make commitments to Hollywood the way they once did,"" Mr. Osborne said. ""It used to be a place where everybody lived, and they were all very clubby and they all got along.""

Still, at the end of the day, this is a place where many movie stars live and can be spotted beyond the obvious places like Craig's in West Hollywood, or Nobu in Malibu. One afternoon, when I drove up to the remote Hollywood Reservoir for a late-afternoon run, I saw Justin Bieber stepping out of a car, surrounded by bodyguards, off for his own jaunt. On one fall evening, Mandy Patinkin slipped in for Rosh Hashana services at Temple Israel of Hollywood. I have seen Leonardo DiCaprio at Angelini Osteria and Jake Gyllenhaal at Ammo, two of Los Angeles's better, if decidedly lower-profile, Italian restaurants that manage to provide the celebrity without the flashbulbs. The ""Modern Family"" star, Eric Stonestreet, was eating dinner and posing for photos with fans at the restaurant Animal one day; the next day, Jesse Tyler Ferguson, his television husband, emerged from the ArcLight. Ezra Koenig of Vampire Weekend was eating, incongruously enough, at the Musso & Frank Grill. Is this a different Hollywood from the one where Judy Garland kept a house while filming ""The Wizard of Oz,"" where stars used to pack it in at the old Spago above Sunset Boulevard? Yes, it is. But so what?","The nexus of glamour may now be more of a mind-set than a dot on the map, but this section of Los Angeles remains vastly interesting.",eb12bac2-d3c8-5baa-9df6-57947bb57744,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/15/travel/15HOLLYWOOD/15HOLLYWOOD-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=f28a99c4e76b0d391ff612ace1b702249b0dafbf2a7c66c872714f8ea2523bf4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From the Hollywood sign, which once read Hollywoodland, the lights below promise a world of celebrities, mansions, palm tree-lined boulevards and movie studios.",eb12bac2-d3c8-5baa-9df6-57947bb57744,N24News/imgs/eb12bac2-d3c8-5baa-9df6-57947bb57744.jpg,4
Food,Anthony Bourdain's Alma Mater Will Remember Him With a Scholarship,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/19/dining/anthony-bourdain-scholarship-cia.html,"A year after the death of Anthony Bourdain, the chef and world-traveling television personality, the Culinary Institute of America is creating a scholarship in his memory.

The scholarship, announced on Wednesday, will be awarded each year to one or more students to pursue study abroad. ""Travel was such a part of who he was; it was life-changing for him,"" said L. Timothy Ryan, the president of the school, based in Hyde Park, N.Y., where Mr. Bourdain graduated in 1978 and received an honorary doctorate in 2017.

Mr. Bourdain was found dead last June in a hotel bathroom in Kaysersberg, a small village in the Alsace region of France, where officials determined that he had hanged himself. This year, as the June 8 anniversary of the death neared, one of his closest friends, Eric Ripert, the chef and an owner of Le Bernardin, said people approached him about ways to commemorate Mr. Bourdain.

""I thought it should be a celebration of Anthony Bourdain,"" Mr. Ripert said. ""It would be better to celebrate him on his birthday, June 25, not the day he died, with something meaningful to recognize him.""",The Culinary Institute of America plans to promote study abroad as friends and fans mark the month of his birth and death.,0859b137-1991-54da-a200-f6dc46a40d56,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/30/world/09bourdain/09bourdain-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=486e0bda2856010cbff08b9882f2b2d2e062d5a6e2ff8207c9c21334f81678f4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Anthony Bourdain, the chef, author and host of ""Parts Unknown,"" in New York in 2015.",0859b137-1991-54da-a200-f6dc46a40d56,N24News/imgs/0859b137-1991-54da-a200-f6dc46a40d56.jpg,17
Economy,Reasons Abound for Ebb in Job Growth,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/05/business/economy/us-added-only-115000-jobs-in-april-rate-is-8-1.html,"The nation's employers are creating jobs at less than half the pace they were when this year began, according to a government report released Friday. The addition of just 115,000 jobs in April was disappointing, but economists urged no panic just yet. Maybe the unusually warm winter had encouraged companies to do their spring hiring a little early, they offered in one of several theories. Maybe high gas prices, now falling, temporarily discouraged job growth. Better yet, maybe this latest report understates how many jobs were added, since the initial estimates for earlier months have been revised upward. But no matter which hopeful explanation you choose, America's 13.7 million jobless workers still look pretty discouraged. Many economists had been predicting that strong job growth early this year would persuade many people sitting on the sidelines to re-enter the job market.

Instead, for reasons that are unclear, workers continue to peel off the labor force. An estimated 342,000 Americans dropped out of the job market altogether in April. That is why the unemployment rate fell to 8.1 percent from 8.2 percent -- not because more workers found jobs, but because so many people left the work force. It's just one month of data, and the survey numbers are not precise. Still, the figures fit into a longer-term trend. The share of working-age Americans who are either working or actively looking for a job is now at its lowest level since 1981, when far fewer women chose to do paid work. The share of men taking part in the labor force fell in April to 70 percent, the lowest figure since the Labor Department began collecting these data in 1948. The decline in labor force participation is partly because baby boomers are hitting retirement age. But economists had expected the wave of retirements to be at least partly offset by the number of workers rejoining the labor force as the economy improved. ""There were a lot of younger people who had gone back to school to get more education and training, and we thought we'd see more of them joining the work force now,"" said Andrew Tilton, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs. Instead, the number of young people in the labor force also fell.

""May, June and July -- the months when people are typically coming out of schooling -- will be the big test,"" he said. College enrollment, particularly among young women, has indeed been growing quickly, which bodes well for the economy in the years ahead. But of course not everyone dropping out of the labor force is doing so to collect more credentials. With the average duration of unemployment now at an interminable 39.1 weeks, many people have simply given up looking for work. Many of them might have given up months ago, but had clung to the job search because doing so kept them eligible for extended unemployment benefits. As more and more workers roll off those benefits, they are officially stopping their job searches and dropping out.

It's unclear whether workers will continue dropping out, said Alan B. Krueger, chairman of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April.
* Bank regulators released a 'road map' for crypto regulation that is short on details. ""I think you're going to have crosscurrents,"" he said. ""One factor is that extended benefits have kept people in the labor force. But then some of the reforms that the president proposed and that Congress has passed will encourage the unemployed to search for a job."" He cited as an example a federal program granting funds to 10 states that are experimenting with subsidized training and private sector jobs, modeled in part on a pilot program in Georgia.

Other job-training and placement programs have been strained by government shortfalls, however. Washington also seems unlikely to engage in additional significant job-creation programs before the November elections. The Federal Reserve, which had helped stimulate the economy in the past when Congress deadlocked, does not seem to be gearing up for more monetary easing, either. ""This keeps the Fed where they've been,"" Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse, said of the April jobs report, which the Labor Department released Friday. ""There could be more stimulus if April turns out to be a new trend, but by itself it's no provocation for a quick ease."" Rather than prodding employment growth, the government is actually providing a drag on the economy. Government spending has fallen for six straight quarters as Recovery Act funds have been exhausted and state and local governments have struggled with tax revenue shortfalls. Accordingly, the public sector has been shedding workers relatively consistently since the recovery officially began in mid-2009, with the exception of a brief spike of temporary hiring during the decennial census. Last month, governments eliminated 15,000 jobs. Private companies added 130,000 jobs over all, with professional and business services, retail trade and health care doing the most hiring. ""My guess is the weather made job growth look too strong in the first couple of months, and now it looks too weak as payback for the warm winter weather,"" said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist for Capital Economics. ""It'll probably settle somewhere in between."" Averaging the strong months of total job growth in January and February with the weaker ones in March and April, the economy has been adding about 200,000 jobs a month this year. Job growth of any kind is obviously welcome. That pace, however, is not nearly fast enough to recover the losses from the Great Recession and its aftermath in the foreseeable future. At this rate, it would take more than two more years just to return to the prerecession peak in employment, though the country should actually have even more jobs given population growth and the current size of the economy.","Economists cited various possible factors behind the addition of only 115,000 jobs in April, but none are likely to comfort 13.7 million jobless workers.",1b1b93d3-bf6e-5bc9-bbb7-c1cfca23a4cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/05/business/05jobs-pic/05jobs-pic-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=370&w=600&s=4c3213e92946ebe7a234f7085744a6624b035084b8978d6cf0067546dfe20015&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Job seekers at an employment fair this week in Queens.

Fashion & Style,Dede Wilsey Is the Defiant Socialite,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/25/fashion/dede-wilsey-de-young-museum-san-francisco-socialite.html,"For the past year, the San Francisco socialite has been fending off those who would like to see her forced out of the museums she has lavished with her time and money for two decades. That, at least, is how Ms. Wilsey, 72, describes the recent turmoil. During lunch at her Napa Valley estate, a white Maltese sat on her lap, sniffing a plate of sliced peaches and cantaloupe. ""You can't beat me,"" Ms. Wilsey said, stroking the dog, Dazzle. The top of its head was stained pink from her lipstick kisses. ""You will see me prevail. That's what you will see."" Never mind that the state attorney general's office is investigating whether a 2014 payment to a colleague authorized by Ms. Wilsey violated laws governing nonprofits. Never mind that the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco recently paid out $2 million to settle a whistle-blower case. Never mind that, in April, two board trustees resigned in protest, one telling a reporter Ms. Wilsey ran the organization ""like a personal fiefdom."" On this pleasant late-summer afternoon, Ms. Wilsey, who wore a wrap of oyster-size pearls around her neck, was still wondering about those press reports in July holding that she had resigned her post as president of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, which oversees her favored de Young, as well as the Legion of Honor museum. The story of her resignation was simply not true, she said, and she had a recording of a June board meeting on her iPhone to prove it.

Her coal eyes flashed when she was asked to identify the anonymous wag who had told a reporter her run had come to an end. ""I have no idea, and I'd like to kill them,"" Ms. Wilsey said. No one was going to run her out, she added. She would remain, overseeing politics and fund-raising. And to her detractors she would like to say: ""You will look like a bunch of idiots. And I am going to laugh myself silly."" San Francisco has long had its share of society scandals to titillate everyone from the bohos of Haight-Ashbury to the swells on Nob Hill. People here still recall when the oil scion Gordon Getty revealed in 1999 that he had a second family in Los Angeles while married to his wife, Ann. But nothing in the recent past has captivated the city's gossips more than the travails of Diane Wilsey, known as Dede, a daughter of privilege who moved to San Francisco in 1965 and made a name for herself as one of the city's most prominent fund-raisers. Her name is on the Diane B. Wilsey Center for the Opera. She raised funds to restore Grace Cathedral, one of the city's fabled landmarks, and a Catholic girls school in the Mission District. But Ms. Wilsey is best known for her patronage of the de Young in Golden Gate Park. Many people credit her with saving it after the original 1919 structure was damaged in the 1989 earthquake. She led the campaign to raise $208 million to build a new one, donating $10 million herself and sweet-talking or strong-arming the balance through her deep connections to Northern California's aristocrats. But friends and others who acknowledge her charitable works say she can be dismissive of less prominent peers, especially those who clash with her. Her stepson, Sean Wilsey, cast her as a ruthless gold digger in his acclaimed 2005 memoir, ""Oh, the Glory of It All."" ""She can laugh and joke with anyone, even a truck driver,"" said Harry Parker, the Fine Arts Museums' director from 1987 to 2005. ""Her failing is that she has not always listened to what people told her if they didn't have social standing.""

In the end, Ms. Wilsey believes, her critics will be silenced. With the millions of dollars she has given to San Francisco institutions, she believes she should be praised, not pilloried. ""I personally feel they should be erecting a statue to me,"" she said. ""I know you are in town, and I know why you are calling,"" said the husky voice on the other end of the telephone. ""But I don't talk about my friends."" Speaking was Denise Hale, one of the city's grande dames, whose late husband earned a fortune running department stores. San Francisco society is dominated by wealthy families who settled there generations earlier. They include the Bechtels (who made their money in construction), the Hellmans (finance), the Gettys (oil), the Fishers (retail) and the Wilseys (real estate). The people who are part of this small, exclusive world close ranks when a scandal breaks. ""I think people are loath to criticize society people because of the money,"" said Lois Lehrman, who owned the society magazine Nob Hill Gazette for three decades. A number of philanthropists refused to be interviewed for this article, including Vanessa Getty, a socialite and museum trustee with Ms. Wilsey, and the heiress Charlotte Mailliard Shultz, San Francisco's chief of protocol.

And politics is something Ms. Wilsey understands all too well. She was born in Washington, D.C., in 1944, the second of three children of Wiley T. Buchanan Jr., the chief of protocol under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Her father also served as ambassador to Luxembourg and Austria. Ms. Wilsey's mother, Ruth, 98, is an heir to the Dow Chemical fortune. As a girl, Ms. Wilsey accompanied her parents to Europe, where they dined with royal families and heads of state. She summered at the family's estate, once owned by the Vanderbilts, in Newport, R.I. ""I sort of always had social standing because my parents did,"" she said. At her Napa Valley estate, Dazzle frolicked on the grass with another Maltese, Twinkle. A fountain gurgled. The outdoor table was set with pink monogrammed linens framed by nosegays of fragrant pink roses. To Ms. Wilsey's left was a brass bell. She rang it when she wanted the cook's attention. Picking at a skewer of grilled chicken, she said she was overweight as a child and vowed never to be fat again. ""I'm a middle child,"" she said. ""I was also the one nobody listened to."" That caused tension, she said, with her older sister, Bonnie, whom she looked up to. ""My father would say: 'This is my pretty daughter, Bonnie. And this is my smart daughter, Dede.' Do you think I wanted to be 'smart'? I just wanted to be dumb and pretty. I just wanted once to have him say, 'This is my dumb, pretty daughter, Dede.'"" Beauty, though, is relative. Ms. Wilsey was on the cover of Town & Country in June 1962, her svelte figure wrapped in yards of fabric and white lace. She was a debutante, and her father wrote in the magazine about her coming out. At 1 a.m., the guests gathered at ""Dede's Peppermint Lounge,"" a custom-made dance club designed by Valerian Rybar, a prominent interior decorator at the time. The Bo Diddley Trio played that night; guests did the step that was all the rage at the time, the twist. Three years later, she married John Traina Jr., a shipping executive from San Francisco, ""despite her parents' objections,"" according to press reports at the time. Across 15 years of marriage, they had two sons, Trevor and Todd. After the divorce was final, she married Al Wilsey, a real estate magnate and former husband of a good friend, Pat Montandon, then a society columnist in San Francisco.

By all accounts, Ms. Wilsey found a forgiving patriarch in her second husband. He would whisk her off by helicopter to Mendocino, Calif., for picnics. He didn't mind her razor-sharp tongue. ""Never feel guilty for anything you ever did to me,"" she said he told her once, ""because you make these snarky comments once in awhile."" And every Christmas, they kicked off the social season with a party at their Pacific Heights mansion for about 300 of San Francisco's elite. Mr. Brown, the former mayor, was a regular. ""It was mandatory,"" he said. ""If you ever get an invitation, you have to go. If you don't get invited, that is even worse."" Guests in tuxedos and Oscar de la Renta gowns gathered in a receiving line to pay their respects to the Wilseys. The guest list for the event functioned as an annual measure of social status. ""She was very definitive about who was on the list,"" Mr. Parker said. ""It was her statement about who really mattered."" Ms. Wilsey has continued to hold the party more than a decade after Mr. Wilsey's death. But such soirees are more than an opportunity to mingle with society friends; they also provide her with a setting where she can shake down her connected friends for money to benefit the institutions she treasures. ""Mom and I were dancing at a formal event,"" said her son Trevor, a technology entrepreneur, ""and she said, 'Dance me over to that man over there.' She reached over to the person and said to me, 'He is going to give me $1 million for our museum.' The man said, 'I am?'"" A month later, she got a $1 million check from the man in question. Ms. Wilsey's living room tables in Rutherford are cluttered with photos of her sons, their families, her parents and her two former husbands. When asked who her good friends were, she named Todd and Trevor. ""My husbands,"" she added. ""They were my best friends."" Mr. Traina's ashes are stored in a wooden box near the hearth. ""My sons said he liked people and belonged in the living room,"" she said. Mr. Wilsey's ashes are in a stone urn in a private garden visible through a picture window.

She was elected board president in 1998 and named chief executive of the Fine Arts Museums in 2011. The chief executive title fell to her after John Buchanan, the former museum director who brought a populist sensibility to the de Young, told her he had cancer and was going to die. During his tenure, he ran the museum while she raised the funds to attract the traveling blockbuster exhibits celebrating King Tut and Yves Saint Laurent. But while Ms. Wilsey is applauded for her ability to bring in coin, she is less exalted for her managerial skill absent a strong partner like Mr. Parker, Mr. Buchanan or the newly appointed director, Max Hollein, an art historian and museum administrator from Vienna who was hired in March. ""A lowly staff member does not command her attention,"" Mr. Parker said. ""There is a master-servant relationship that gets in the way of things."" Ms. Wilsey denied the characterization. Still, several curators and others have bristled under her leadership. Robert Flynn Johnson, the museum's curator emeritus, said he and other curators were asked to wear suits and ties to a gala dinner for the opening of the new de Young in 2005. When he arrived, though, he said, he found that he wasn't invited for the dinner portion of the evening, only for cocktails. He was irked, too, when Ms. Wilsey paid $1,000 apiece to have the names of her dogs posted on a donor wall meant for patrons unable to lay out huge sums. ""Some people had to save $100 a month,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""It was a sacrifice. My parents' names are on that wall. She has a whole court named after her."" Ms. Wilsey's woes began in earnest in 2014, when she approved that a check be cut from the museum's coffer to pay a retired city lighting engineer, Bill Huggins, who had worked at the museum and was ailing. Ms. Wilsey was friendly with Therese Chen, Mr. Huggins's wife and a de Young employee. Ms. Wilsey said she did not initiate the payment, nor did she need board approval for it. She said she could not discuss the amount of the check, but press reports put it at roughly $450,000. It was co-signed by Michelle Gutierrez, the museum's chief financial officer at the time. In 2015, though, Ms. Gutierrez filed a complaint with the city and the state attorney general's office, saying the payment was improper. After doing so, she was dismissed.

Ms. Gutierrez, Ms. Wilsey and others involved are not allowed to discuss the situation as part of a settlement agreement. But according to press reports, when trustees involved in the Fine Arts Museums' organization learned about the payment last year, they expressed concern that it was made without the board's knowledge or approval. Bernard Osher, a friend of Ms. Wilsey's who attends her annual Christmas party, resigned from the board. (He did not return a call seeking comment.) According to Mr. Parker, Mr. Osher ""thought the action was outrageous and couldn't support it."" More recently, Louise Renne, San Francisco's former city attorney, was one of two other trustees to resign, saying she could not ""fulfill her fiduciary duty,"" given the board's management. ""The old guard can't stay around forever, and it shouldn't,"" Ms. Renne said. In July, the museum settled with Ms. Gutierrez for $2 million to avoid a potential wrongful-termination lawsuit. The money given to Mr. Huggins was repaid to the museum by unnamed donors. (Ms. Wilsey declined to say if she was one of them.) Ms. Wilsey said she expects her detractors to be surprised when they find out that she is not leaving. But in a new arrangement, she said, she will share more management responsibility with six other trustees, a move she has been advocating for months. While accepting the change, Ms. Wilsey said: ""There is no way if I were a man I would be the victim. A man who gives as much money as I do?"" As lunch wound down, she recalled a time when her granddaughter, Daisy, hit her head on a glass table at the age of 2. ""I heard this horrible crash,"" Ms. Wilsey said, ""and she came out from under the table with this big bang on the head. And I said to her: 'Daisy, this is not going to be the last time you hit your head on a glass ceiling. But you did the right thing. Never cry. Never show that it hurts. That's the most important thing you can learn from hitting your head today.'""",She has power in the San Francisco arts scene. Her critics don't like the way she's used it.,b946cdfd-cc7d-5f49-a686-efa5220a77b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/25/fashion/25DEDE/25DEDE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=c80614fab2bd1173cebaac75055798420a6b2bb4996dd29045506efcd12940dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dede Wilsey, an arts benefactor in San Francisco, at her home in the Napa Valley.",b946cdfd-cc7d-5f49-a686-efa5220a77b0,N24News/imgs/b946cdfd-cc7d-5f49-a686-efa5220a77b0.jpg,19
Media,"Away From TV Studio, BBC Dispute Over Pay Equality Plays Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/07/business/media/bbc-samira-ahmed-employment-tribunal.html,"LONDON -- For the past several days, BBC managers and executives have trooped to a small hearing roo m in central London to defend the broadcaster's decision to pay a woman a fraction of what it paid a man for what she argues is similar work. The testimony, which concluded Thursday, has been long and drawn out, comparing in colorless detail the company's appraisal of a well-known female TV host's work and a well-known male TV host's work. The BBC's position: Her work and her profile were not equal to her male colleague's. It is just the latest episode in a two-year drama that has put the BBC on the ropes because of criticism of its pay practices. The BBC is being sued for back pay by Samira Ahmed, who argues that she was underpaid for years hosting a program called ""Newswatch."" Ms. Ahmed was paid 440 pounds an episode in 2012 when she started presenting the weekly program , which discusses audience responses to BBC news coverage.

Ms. Ahmed says her work is comparable to that of Jeremy Vine, a colleague who hosts a program that allows viewers to sound off over entertainment programs on the network. Mr. Vine was paid PS3,000 an episode when Ms. Ahmed started. British law stipulates that employees should receive equal pay for equal work. The broadcaster, which is publicly funded, has been under heavy scrutiny of late over equal-pay practices. Just last year, Carrie Gracie abruptly quit her role as China editor over being paid less than her male peers. In Ms. Ahmed's case, the BBC has defended itself by playing down her profile and contributions, as well as the significance of one of its own programs. It disputes her characterization of her work as similar to Mr. Vine's. ""Jeremy Vine and Samira Ahmed perform very different roles in their work for the BBC,"" Gautam Rangarajan , the BBC's director of strategy, said in a statement submitted to the hearing. ""Jeremy has decades of visibility in high-profile programs that span both non-news and news output."" ""Samira Ahmed is an experienced journalist but with a lower public profile and narrower focus of expertise than Jeremy Vine,"" he added. But Mr. Rangarajan also noted that ""the BBC recognizes that broadcasting itself creates recognition.""

In several days of hearings, BBC managers testified that because Mr. Vine's program, ""Points of View,"" dealt with lighthearted entertainment, rather than news, he could command more of a fee because he was expected to be ""a friend"" to the viewer. For example, if a viewer wrote in to Mr. Vine's program, and the viewer's question was answered with a statement from BBC management, Mr. Vine ""would roll his eyes, as if to say, 'I've heard all that before,'"" Simon Miller, a producer for the show, said in a statement to the hearing.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""Although that was in the script, it was believable coming from him,"" Mr. Miller said. ""He was the audience's friend when he was presenting and interviewing."" Ms. Ahmed's program, on the other hand, ""is a journalistic program, which adopts an interrogative approach with a serious tone,"" James Mallet , a ""Newswatch"" producer, said in his witness statement. This difference applies across all programs, said Roger Leatham, the director of business affairs for BBC Studios Production. ""None of this is to denigrate the skills of factual presenters and journalists. They can also be highly skilled and excellent at their jobs,"" Mr. Leatham said in his statement submitted to the hearing. ""They may work as hard as, and sometimes harder than, non-news presenters, but the market for their services operates differently and always has done from the days of Morecambe and Wise and before,"" he added, referring to a British comedy duo popular in the 1970s.

Over the course of the hearing Ms. Ahmed sat on one side, flanked by her supporters, including Michelle Stanistreet, the general secretary of the National Union of Journalists, and Ms. Gracie, the former China editor. The BBC's representatives sat on the other, surrounded by lawyers and boxes of papers . The hearing was conducted by the Central London Employment Tribunal, and it is not known when the three-judge panel will deliver a ruling. Mark Thompson, who was director-general of the BBC from 2004 to 2012, is now chief executive of The New York Times Company. Ms. Ahmed's complaint adds to the continued scrutiny focused on the BBC since 2017, when it was forced to publish the pay bands of its most highly paid employees, after attracting criticism for seemingly lavish salaries it was heaping on some stars. Relatively few women were in the highest pay bands, the report showed. It was through this report that Ms. Gracie discovered she was being paid less than men who were also regional editors. She took her complaint to her supervisors and was offered a raise, but not one that lifted her to the same level as her male peers. Ms. Gracie resigned in protest. The BBC eventually apologized in June last year and gave Ms. Gracie her back pay, but not before executives were grilled before a parliamentary committee examining the BBC's pay practices. Furthermore, the BBC has been dealing with the fallout from the pay report. It received almost 300 grievance complaints, and about 120 women are seeking to bring a collective case against unequal pay.","One of the broadcaster's employees, Samira Ahmed, has taken it to court, accusing it of paying a man much more for the same work.",dc0a5434-5658-589e-afa5-ee7a364fa800,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/06/business/06bbctrial/06bbctrial-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=92aa71d97eb5e2d7df6470e50f2cdc95fa8b166624b42c8d7436eae065b422e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Samira Ahmed at the Central London Employment Tribunal.

Automobiles,"A Woman, Her Dog and a British Sports Car Dream Fulfilled",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/automobiles/a-woman-her-dog-and-a-british-sports-car-dream-fulfilled.html,"On a recent autumn day, Sue Howard, a sculptor from New Jersey, sat in the driver's seat of her fully restored 1963 Type 14 Lotus Elite Series-2. Her 6-month-old black miniature poodle, Draper, sat next to her, his tongue lapping at the wind. The day's drive would be an hourlong journey on country roads to the Performance Garage Club in Frenchtown, N.J., where Ms. Howard houses a neat collection of British sports cars. Since her husband, Scott, died in 1998, Ms. Howard has endeavored to fulfill a lengthy ""bucket list,"" something she says her husband never had the chance to do. Her list included learning to drive her three English sports cars on the racetrack. ""I simply love the design of these cars,"" she said. In addition to the Elite, Ms. Howard owns an early production Lotus Elise from 2005 and a nicely restored 1962 MG Midget Mk I -- a gift from her father. ""I had been looking to purchase a left-hand-drive Elite for close to a decade,"" said Ms. Howard, wearing tightly laced driving shoes and a quilted black jacket. ""It was the first Lotus I fell in love with.""

Ms. Howard credits her father, Max Mesner, an engineer and inventor who helped develop color television in the 1940s, with starting her passion for British sports cars. Mr. Mesner commuted to his lab in a Morris Minor, said Ms. Howard, adding that she learned how to drive a manual transmission at age 11, with her father by her side in the Morris. ""I've never owned a car with an automatic transmission,"" Ms. Howard said with a hint of pride in her voice. After college, Ms. Howard married Scott Howard, a risk management expert for J.P. Morgan, who shared her love for beautiful cars. Before their marriage, Ms. Howard's father sold his prized MG Midget to her for $1. It would serve as the Howards' weekend ride for nearly three decades. Mr. Howard was responsible for introducing his wife to the Lotus brand.

""He took me to a car show in Manhattan in the early '70s, and he said, 'You've got to see these cars, Sue. They're just phenomenal,'"" Ms. Howard said. She added that the show featured several Lotus models, including an Elite, a Europa and an Elan. ""I liked all of them, but the Elite really blew me away.""

Life was busy for the next three decades, and the couple's passion for sports cars took a back seat to business. Mr. Howard rose through the ranks at J.P. Morgan while Ms. Howard thrived as an art teacher and sculptor. Everything changed when Mr. Howard died in 1998, leaving Ms. Howard unexpectedly alone for the first time in her life. ""We were pretty much inseparable,"" she said. ""He was bright, witty and very good looking -- a great buddy."" Ms. Howard said that it was about four years after his death that she began to explore her automotive passion. ""I needed time to collect myself and figure out what the rest of my life was going to be about,"" she said. Her husband's death inspired a sense of immediacy in her. ""Scott always said that he would do things later, when he retired. He never got anywhere near that. So I know there is never a second to lose, in a sense."" With her husband gone, Ms. Howard turned to her dog Encore, another black miniature poodle, to serve as her co-pilot -- both in life and on the road. Together, the two completed a 10,000-mile, cross-country, winter road trip that took them from the Great Plains of North Dakota west to Lake Tahoe in Nevada and north to Seattle, via the Pacific Coast Highway. ""Scott and I never got to do the trip together, but it was something we had always wanted to do,"" Ms. Howard said. ""I would do it again in a flash -- though maybe not in the middle of winter."" Encore, who once joined Ms. Howard for a thrilling hot lap around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in her Lotus Elise, died recently, one month shy of his 16th birthday, leaving Ms. Howard with an empty passenger seat.

""I put him in his carrier in the Elise because I know there are going to be fast laps and I don't want him to swing around,"" Ms. Howard said, her hand resting softly atop Draper's head. As part of her bucket list, Ms. Howard recently made arrangements to donate her entire collection of cars to the Museum of Modern Art upon her death. ""The cars are dear to me, and I wouldn't want some executor from a trust company to sell them to just anyone,"" Ms. Howard said, noting that MoMA would most likely sell the collection upon receipt. ""If MoMA chooses to sell them, they could place them appropriately and maximize the amount of money that would go to the museum."" The museum, always happy for donations, has another connection with Ms. Howard. Emmett Watson, MoMA's director of planned giving, is a car buff himself. ""Sue is a charmer, just a lovely person -- we love to talk cars and art together,"" he said. ""We are very grateful that Sue has made this very generous provision to MoMA; we rely heavily on testamentary gifts to keep the museum thriving for generations to come.""","When Sue Howard's husband died unexpectedly a decade ago, she turned the love for classic British cars the couple had shared into a living pursuit.",63f31d11-d09d-5422-b00d-7361782e5ca6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/24/automobiles/British1-TOP/British1-TOP-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=368&w=600&s=8c0bc4875c0dd77a926d9d6920028aa77c3c69eea5e3e332a1eeb2ae4c27b78a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Sue Howard and her dog, Draper, stand in front of Ms. Howard's 1963 Type 14 Lotus Elite Series-2.",63f31d11-d09d-5422-b00d-7361782e5ca6,N24News/imgs/63f31d11-d09d-5422-b00d-7361782e5ca6.jpg,23
Real Estate,2 Condo Sales on 'Billionaires' Row' Lift the Market,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/30/realestate/2-condo-sales-on-billionaires-row-lift-the-market.html,"A flurry of pricey condominium sales, many of them at Manhattan's newest ultraluxury developments, provided a strong finale to an already robust 2016. The most expensive of these closed December transactions, according to New York City property records, was an aerie that encompasses the 88th floor of the 96-story  in ""Billionaires' Row,"" between 56th and 57th Streets. The building is the tallest residential tower in the Western Hemisphere, topping out at 1,396 feet, or more than a quarter-mile. Lewis A. Sanders, the founder and chief executive of Sanders Capital, a money management firm, and his wife, Alice, paid $60,893,873 for the apartment, which has monthly carrying costs totaling $32,289.

Big purchases were also recorded at the new 551 West 21st Street, 150 Charles Street, 27 Wooster Street, One Riverside Park and Greenwich Lane, in addition to 15 Central Park West and One57. And some other notable transactions involved the prominent sculptor Anish Kapoor, the British stage and film director Anthony Page and the African telecom mogul Strive Masiyiwa. The Sanderses' new apartment, unit No. 88 at 432 Park, was New York City's second most expensive closed sale in 2016. The priciest, also at the building, was a full-floor penthouse at the pinnacle that sold in September for $87.7 million, one of a steady stream of sales last year at the tower. Despite the sky-high price, Mr. and Ms. Sanders, who were represented by the Robby Browne team at the Corcoran Group, managed to get a 20 percent discount from the original asking price of $76.5 million.

Their unit, which officially closed in early December, has helicopter views of Central Park, the Atlantic Ocean, Long Island Sound, the highlands of New Jersey and the Manhattan skyline. The apartment's 8,055 square feet includes five bedrooms, seven and a half baths, a library and a family room. And like the other 103 residences in the slim concrete-and-glass condominium, the apartment has 12.6-foot ceilings and 10-by-10-foot square windows. Each apartment also has a private elevator landing. Richard Wallgren of Macklowe Properties Sales and Douglas Elliman Development Marketing represented the building's sponsors, the developers Macklowe Properties and the CIM Group. Other new-development sales included a penthouse at the Norman Foster-designed 551 West 21st Street, which overlooks the Hudson River in West Chelsea. At $34.6 million, the sale of this unit, PH18, was the third most expensive closing in December and among the top closings for 2016. The buyer used the limited liability company City House.

But not all the big sales last month were anonymous. The British sculptor Anish Kapoor, who was born in India, bought a four-bedroom four-and-a-half-bath condo at 56 Leonard, a new luxury high-rise in TriBeCa with a distinctive Jenga-like cantilevered design. The price for his unit, 47W -- it has three balconies with cityscape and Hudson River views -- was $13.6 million. The original list price had been $15 million. Mr. Kapoor, who was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2013, is best known for his large-scale sculptures, and one of his latest creations is about to be installed later this year at his new home in New York City: He designed a two-story, 40-ton piece for the base of 56 Leonard.

On the selling side last month, the director Anthony Page, who was also born in India and settled in Britain, sold unit No. 4 at 32 West 20th Street, a prewar building in the Flatiron district. The unit, which had been configured into two apartments, has 4,000 square feet. It was bought for $4.02 million by Vineet Seth, according to city records. It was first listed in 2015 for $6.5 million. Mr. Page has worked on numerous films and theater productions, including the Broadway revival of ""Waiting for Godot."" Last month's biggest co-op sale was at the twin-towered Eldorado, at 300 Central Park West, between 90th and 91st Street, across from Central Park. The majestic building has had a long list of celebrity residents, including Faye Dunaway, Michael J. Fox, Moby and Alec Baldwin.","A flurry of pricey condominium sales, many at Manhattan's newest ultraluxury developments, provided a strong finale to an already robust 2016.",f2c245f6-2278-5f14-af57-c6991e1692f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/01/realestate/01TICKET1/01TICKET1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ea1bdf241f6abfac65a46a48de79f76d3c94ef233c6dc979752024b740f2084f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,432 Park Avenue,f2c245f6-2278-5f14-af57-c6991e1692f1,N24News/imgs/f2c245f6-2278-5f14-af57-c6991e1692f1.jpg,7
Dance,'The Golden Cockerel' Is a Ballet Bird With a Kick,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/05/arts/dance/the-golden-cockerel-american-ballet-theater.html,"It's almost a cliche to say that a ballerina's arms suggest wings -- the technique of ballet itself lends itself to metaphors of lightness and flight. Its repertory is filled with creatures of the air: melancholy swans, magical firebirds, charming bluebirds, even butterflies. This season, American Ballet Theater introduces yet another feathered creature to its menagerie, the gold-plumed rooster in Alexei Ratmansky's ""The Golden Cockerel."" ""The Golden Cockerel"" opens midway through a season in which Mr. Ratmansky's works dominate the repertory. By July, eight of his ballets will have been performed on the Met stage. But, as the recent revival of his 2012 ""Firebird"" underscored, his idea of birdlike movement doesn't necessarily coincide with the familiar 19th-century image of fluid arms, delicate necks and fluttering feet. This is even more true of his ""Golden Cockerel."" ""The movement is almost mechanical,"" Mr. Ratmansky said recently at the company's studios, ""very strong, brilliant and sharp, with fast changes of focus."" In a rehearsal, Skylar Brandt, one of four dancers performing the title role, slid forward several feet on her pointes, then folded her arms back at her sides and flickered her elbows quickly, almost like mechanical winglets, and finally bent forward at a right angle, jerkily, like a marionette. Later she skittered across the studio in a series of blisteringly fast backward-traveling leaps; again, the impression was both brilliant and almost frighteningly inhuman.

Mr. Ratmansky's golden bird has a long history, onstage and in the literary imagination. He (a cockerel is a young rooster, though he's danced here by a woman) is merely the most recent incarnation of a character that first appeared in a folk tale by Alexander Pushkin. (Another rooster plays a bit part in Frederick Ashton's ""La Fille Mal Gardee,"" which just ended its run.) Pushkin began jotting down his old nursemaid's stories in the 1820s while in internal exile at the family estate. (He was being punished for his support of the Decembrist revolt against Czar Nicholas I.) Pushkin's tales, or skazki, are familiar to most Russian children, as they were to the young Mr. Ratmansky. (There is even a Soviet cartoon version, from 1967.) It's a strange story, in which the cockerel plays only a small but crucial part. A doddering old czar (Dodon) wants only to sleep. (""It is the Russian dream to do nothing and to sleep all the time!"" Mr. Ratmansky said. ""Don't forget, the winters in Russia are long."") His kingdom is attacked from all sides. An astrologer offers a solution: a golden cockerel who will crow whenever danger is nigh. After repeated warnings, Dodon marches off to battle a kingdom to the east, where he encounters a beautiful princess. He falls madly in love and decides to make her his wife. When the astrologer demands the princess as his prize, Dodon kills him. Then, in a magical reversal, the cockerel springs to life and kills the czar. In Mr. Ratmansky's version, she lands on the czar's shoulders and pecks him to death. (No, she's not your usual bashful swan.) ""It's really fun to kill someone onstage,"" Cassandra Trenary, one of the dancers performing the role, said after rehearsal.

The moral is hard to unravel. What does it mean? In part, Pushkin's tale was meant to poke fun at the folly of kings, a perennial Russian subject. But, contrary to appearances, ""The Golden Cockerel"" didn't start as a Russian story. Rather, it's an adaptation of a tale by Washington Irving from his ""Tales of the Alhambra"" (1832). It is both a satire and, like the Irving version, an exotic fable in which magic plays a big part. ""There is this interesting relationship between the astrologer and the queen,"" Mr. Ratmansky explained. ""They are both magicians; they come from the same dimension somehow.""

The story's political undercurrent lingered in the 1907 opera it inspired. Composed by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov, it is a cartoonish political satire dressed up as a fairy tale, in which he pushed his usual musical language -- highly colored instrumentation, sinuous melodies, folk motifs -- to a parodic extreme. ""The Russia depicted in this opera is a caricature,"" the Princeton musicologist Simon Morrison said in a phone interview, adding that the composer ""contrasts this with a fantasy space of the exotic east."" In other words, nothing in ""Golden Cockerel"" feels remotely real. Still, the content was troubling enough to alarm the censors and delay its premiere. The opera opened in Moscow in 1909, after Rimsky-Korsakov's death and was picked up a few years later by the Ballets Russes. In that version, from 1914, staged by Michel Fokine, the story was acted out by dancers while the singers and chorus sat in tiers on either side of the stage. The separation of the voice from the body made the similarity to puppet theater even more apparent. Fokine's take was also less political, not ""a satire on royalty,"" he wrote in his memoirs, ""but on human frailty and weakness in general."" His characters were puppetlike, in the style of Russian folk art, echoed by the production's spectacular designs, by the avant-garde painter Natalya Goncharova: brilliantly colored, vehemently two-dimensional, almost childlike. Richard Hudson's designs for the current production are based on Goncharova's, though not as exuberant. ""I simplified some of the backcloths,"" he explained in an email from London, ""to achieve a clear, sharp, coherent stage picture."" In 1937, Fokine created a new, one-act, pure-dance version, without singers. (The designs, again, were by Goncharova.) The cockerel, which had been represented by a prop bird, was now a ballerina on pointe. Extended excerpts were captured on film. (You can see them at the Public Library for the Performing Arts.) Fast forward to 2012, when the Royal Danish Ballet asked Mr. Ratmansky to create a new work for the company. He was intrigued by the lore surrounding the Fokine staging. ""The first knock on the door for me was that Fokine said it's his best ballet,"" said Mr. Ratmansky, who expresses a great love of ballet history. ""I thought, it must be a very special thing."" He went back to watch the footage from the 1930s production and was persuaded to give it a try. His own version quotes just a few of Fokine's movements, particularly in the sharp, jerky choreography for the cockerel. They are like a salute to the ballet's past. Mr. Ratmansky's two-act ballet opened to mixed reviews in Copenhagen in 2012; critics lauded the designs and the characterizations, but some complained that there wasn't enough dancing. For American Ballet Theater, Mr. Ratmansky has added more. Even so, there is more mime than most contemporary audiences are accustomed to, all in the interest of conveying the fantastical story. The political subtext is not emphasized. ""I mean, what do I do, put Putin makeup on the king?"" Mr. Ratmansky asked, with a wry laugh. ""I wish I could be more daring in that sense, but I don't see how I can translate that. For me, it's about the music and visuals and characters.""",Alexei Ratmansky reanimates a gold-plumed character with a long history onstage and in the literary imagination.,bc471133-f348-53ee-a6a6-b4b4019b3680,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/05/arts/05COQD-OR5/05COQD-OR5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=534bb3c7d6ceb5b7027858c227bc6c14df8e720068a647fa6b137ad17c65c3b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Duncan Lyle, left, and Skylar Brandt in ""The Golden Cockerel.""",bc471133-f348-53ee-a6a6-b4b4019b3680,N24News/imgs/bc471133-f348-53ee-a6a6-b4b4019b3680.jpg,6
Fashion & Style,When Cultural Circles Are Expanded and Redrawn,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/fashion/weddings/when-cultural-circles-are-expanded-and-redrawn.html,"Rabia Ahmad and Christopher Pattison exchanged vows Dec. 19 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau, surrounded by a small group of friends and family.

Rabia Ahmad's parents, who live in Portland, Ore., were not around to witness her exchange of vows with Christopher Pattison on Dec. 19 at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. They were visiting relatives in her father's native Pakistan. But Ms. Ahmad, 39, was not without the warmth of family to greet her when she stepped out of a Mercedes-Benz in front of 141 Worth Street wearing a blush-colored wedding dress amid the whir of cameras, the sun peeking at her from behind dark clouds on a chilly day. Clutching a small bouquet of white roses and pine stems, Ms. Ahmad made her way past a dizzying array of soon-to-be and just-married couples and into the arms of Harper and Ellis Marsili-Batt. The blonde 5-year-old twin girls are part of Ms. Ahmad's ""New York family,"" an ethnic mix of friends who have been helping her view life through an ever-widening lens since she arrived in New York City 22 years ago. ""I was raised in a very conservative Muslim community in Portland, and left there at 17 to attend N.Y.U.,"" Ms. Ahmad said. ""I liked the freedom that came with living in New York, and never went home.""

""The guys I dated followed old-school Muslim traditions,"" said Ms. Ahmad, now a vice president for media relations at Home Box Office in Manhattan. ""I soon realized that what drew us together were the basic commonalities of our religion. But we had a different thought process and a different view of the world, as they were much more conservative than I was."" As the years passed and her circle of friends became more ethnically diverse, Ms. Ahmad began dating men of different faith, much to the chagrin of her father, Dr. Masud Ahmad, a cardiologist in Portland, and her mother, Salma Ahmad, a Filipino woman who was raised Roman Catholic but converted to Islam after meeting her husband, and who is now president of the Islamic Society of Greater Portland. ""When my parents realized that I was opening my mind to meeting other guys, which meant looking outside the tribe, it was a jagged pill for them to swallow,"" said Ms. Ahmad, the youngest of three children. ""I became the black sheep of the family.""

In September 2015, Ms. Ahmad met Mr. Pattison on OkCupid, describing him to family and friends as ""this 6-foot-tall white guy who looked like Adam Yauch of the Beastie Boys."" ""Not exactly what my parents had in mind,"" she said, laughing. But it was no laughing matter to her father. ""As far as I was concerned, as a Muslim father, it was my obligation to see to it that my daughter married a Muslim man,"" Mr. Ahmad said from Saudi Arabia in a recent phone interview. ""At the end of the day, the man Rabia was going to marry would be her decision, but she knew where I stood on the matter."" Mr. Pattison, who was born and raised in Burlington, Vt., and graduated from Champlain College there, was working as a cook for a catering service by day, and as a club D.J. by night when he met Ms. Ahmad. ""He was a genuinely sweet guy who was old-school respectful, opening doors, pulling out chairs, all of those chivalrous things,"" Ms. Ahmad said. ""He was also a history buff who was fascinated by different cultures from around the world."" Mr. Pattison made the 12-hour, round-trip drive to visit Ms. Ahmad in New York just a week after meeting her online.

For the next year and a half, he drove every weekend from Burlington to Brooklyn to spend time with her, racking up nearly 50,000 miles on his 2005 Ford Focus during the long-distance phase of their relationship. ""It wasn't an easy trip, but Rabia made every mile worthwhile,"" Mr. Pattison said. ""Every time I came to visit she would always go out of her way to make me feel welcome, and did little things to show she cared, which made me want to keep coming back."" One day in May 2017 he decided to stay for good. He moved into Ms. Ahmad's studio apartment in Brooklyn Heights, leaving in his rear view mirror the only life he had ever known in Burlington.

""I just picked up and left, and at first, it was definitely a struggle, especially when you consider it took me six months to find a job,"" Mr. Pattison said. ""But Rabia kept saying, 'Just hang on, we will persevere,' and eventually I got both feet down on the ground."" Mr. Pattison, now 44 and a digital designer in Manhattan for the Smithsonian Network, for which he handles digital advertising across all platforms, had barely landed on his feet when Ms. Rabia's parents came to Brooklyn for a first visit in December 2017. ""I knew that her parents were not happy that I wasn't a Muslim,"" Mr. Pattison said, ""so I was very nervous about meeting them."" Among the things that Ms. Ahmad's father brought with him from Portland was literature about Islamic customs, teachings and overall history that he asked Mr. Pattison to read.

In September 2018, Ms. Ahmad and Mr. Pattison visited her parents in Portland, where Mr. Pattison, a lifelong Roman Catholic, met with an imam who was close to the Ahmad family. After what Mr. Pattison described as ""a series of very spiritual and extremely inspirational discussions,"" he did indeed convert to Islam. ""Immediately after the conversion, I asked Rabia's father for her hand in marriage,"" said Mr. Pattison, who proposed to Ms. Ahmad the following month. Mr. Ahmad was thrilled. ""I have been very impressed with Chris, who clearly loves my daughter and has willingly accepted Islam,"" he said. ""I cannot criticize the road that Rabia and Chris have taken regarding his conversion, as I took the same road with my own wife."" When Ms. Ahmad began discussing the two life-changing sacrifices made by Mr. Pattison on her behalf -- leaving his community, and then his religion -- she began to cry.

""His willingness to leave a life behind to commit to the adventure of New York, his expressed interest in learning about my cultural background and faith, and his acceptance of my loud but loving family, made me fall into the kind of love that I had almost given up on finding,"" she said. ""Bottom line: I would have gotten down on one knee if he hadn't beat me to the punch."" Mr. Pattison said that he was fully aware that his decision to convert to Islam ""might not be seen as a popular choice by some who do not look favorably upon Muslims in this current political climate."" ""Nevertheless,"" he added, ""it was the right choice for me.""

""Rabia is such a warm, beautiful person, maybe the best person I have ever met,"" said the elder Mr. Pattison, who co-owns Control Technologies, a company, based in Williston, Vt., that installs temperature controls for heating and ventilation systems. ""She's the best thing that ever happened to my son, and as diverse as their backgrounds are, they are a match made in heaven."" Leonard Pattison was one of the many guests in attendance at the civil ceremony, which was presided over by Michael McSweeney, the New York City clerk, at the Manhattan Marriage Bureau. Other guests included Mr. Pattison's mother, Linda Banks of Brevard, N.C., his stepmother, Eileen Pattison, and Ms. Ahmad's sister, Maryam Ahmad, along with her 6-month-old-daughter, Naila Shah, who live in Hermosa Beach, Calif. (Her husband and a son could not attend, nor could Ms. Ahmad's brother, Tariq Ahmad of Oakland, Calif., and his family.) ""Christopher and Rabia, we wish for you a love that makes both of you better people and continues to give you joy that provides you with energy with which to face the responsibilities of your lives,"" Mr. McSweeney said to the couple after they exchanged wedding rings and vows. Just after Mr. McSweeney pronounced the bride and groom married, they exited the building to showers of applause and confetti from family and friends, including three members of Ms. Rabia's ""New York Family,"" Dan Marsili and Erik Batt, the fathers of the twin girls, and Shuaib Siddiqui, her best friend from N.Y.U. ""Rabia is still the same old bubbly person she was the day I met her,"" said Mr. Siddiqui, who has known the bride for more than 20 years. ""When she was younger, she kept to a certain sense of the way things were supposed to be based on what her parents had taught her. But as I watched her mature, she forged her own path, and decided that she was not going to marry someone just because they were raised like she was. Instead, she would wait for someone, from any walk of life, with values and morals that fell in line with hers, someone with a lot of good inside of them, and she found all of that in Chris.""

After the ceremony, the newlyweds and their contingent went to Dumbo, Brooklyn, to take more photographs before enjoying dinner later that night at Lucali's, a restaurant in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood of Brooklyn, where they dined on pizza, calzones and meatballs, the bride's favorite, that was made specially on her wedding day by Mark Iocono, the owner of Lucali's. Dessert included a blackout chocolate cake from the Little Cup Cake Shop, also in Brooklyn. On July 5 and 6, the couple are to take part, before 300 guests, in a traditional two-day Pakistani wedding ceremony that will conclude at the Sentinel Hotel in Portland, a gift from the bride's parents. ""I'm very much looking forward to it,"" Mr. Ahmad said. ""There is so much worth celebrating.""",She was raised in a conservative Muslim community in Oregon; he was a Roman Catholic born and raised in Vermont.,2acbc93d-7ed4-56bb-8c43-5f5dd7f4e7b8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/13/fashion/weddings/13VOWS1/13VOWS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=a65efd672b6cb352d7acb4a1668114d7f251529f3d66ba5b692fe35008acc5cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The couple will take part in a more formal, two-day Pakistani wedding ceremony in July.",2acbc93d-7ed4-56bb-8c43-5f5dd7f4e7b8,N24News/imgs/2acbc93d-7ed4-56bb-8c43-5f5dd7f4e7b8.jpg,19
Fashion & Style,Striking a Pose on FaceTime,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/18/fashion/weddings/striking-a-pose-on-facetime.html,"Tia Nash, a wedding photographer from New Orleans, was looking forward to a busy spring. She had wedding and engagement photo shoots lined up months in advance, and in mid-March managed to photograph three weddings in one weekend. But a few days later, Ms. Nash became ill with what she believed was the coronavirus, and then the governor of Louisiana issued a stay-at-home order. By the time her fever broke, all of her upcoming assignments had been postponed or canceled. ""I was like: The world is collapsing,"" Ms. Nash said. A passion for capturing the love between recently engaged or married couples was what drew Ms. Nash to the field of wedding photography in the first place, and she was determined to find a way to continue to hold safe photo sessions once she started to feel better. She noticed that other photographers were offering clients the option of socially distanced portrait sessions using the Live Photo feature on FaceTime or by taking screen shots of Zoom calls. So, when a recently engaged couple from New Orleans reached out to inquire about Ms. Nash's wedding packages, she asked if they would be interested in some unconventional engagement photos as well.

""It's not the same quality as I'm used to working with,"" she said, ""but there's still super-sweet moments and cute memories."" The couple had gotten engaged the day before Louisiana's stay-at-home order went into effect, and Ms. Nash said that after she sent them the photographs they texted her to say that they were both in tears. ""I've never met Tia in person, but being on FaceTime with her, it felt like we were having a real engagement photo shoot,"" Ms. Bienes said. ""It made the whole engagement feel real. Before that, we weren't able to celebrate with our family or anything like that, so it was really fun to get to feel special for an hour or so."" Ms. Nash posted the photos in the Mastin Labs -- Community on Facebook, a group for photographers who use Mastin Labs's editing software to share their work. She got so many positive messages that she decided to make a short tutorial about virtual photo shoots, which she sells for $10 on her website. Rose Bowman, an Atlanta-based wedding photographer, was one of the more than 140 people who downloaded Ms. Nash's tutorial. Ms. Bowman has been offering FaceTime and Zoom portrait sessions to couples for about two months or so. ""There's still a way to create art and capture what's happening in the world right now,"" she said. ""I feel like more people are spending time with each other than they ever have. Why not capture it in a safe way for everybody?""

Ms. Bowman typically starts a virtual photo shoot by asking a couple to show her around their space over FaceTime. She picks out the areas with the best lighting for them to pose in, and gives them prompts like she would during an in-person photo shoot. The more candid the better. After one couple's dog jumped on the bed with them during her first FaceTime photo session, she started asking couples to bring out their pets for the shoots. When Ms. Bowman did a virtual photo shoot with Brittin and Todd Pittard on April 11, she made sure their dog, Leroy, got to be front and center. The Atlanta-based couple had been planning to get married surrounded by family and friends, but were forced to cancel their large celebration because of the coronavirus pandemic. They decided to go ahead with the wedding anyway, and were married over Zoom in their backyard by their high school friend, Bryan Weldon, a Universal Life minister. Leroy was their ring bearer. The couple's wedding planner put them in touch with Ms. Bowman, who took their wedding photos after their two-person (and one dog) ceremony.

""She captured a very special moment in time for us,"" Mr. Pittard said, ""and without technology that would not have happened."" Kareem Virgo, a wedding photographer in Palm Beach, Fla., used the Live Photo feature on FaceTime to take candid selfies of his wife, Sandy Virgo, whenever they were apart. As cities and states went into lockdown and his clients began to cancel their photo shoots, Ms. Virgo suggested that he try using FaceTime to take professional, socially distanced portraits of couples. He was sceptical at first, but after getting positive feedback while testing the idea out with a few of his friends, Mr. Virgo started offering free photo sessions to people across the country.

He has shot a few engagement photos, but mainly is focused on giving couples a moment to have fun and forget about the daily stress of the pandemic. ""We just wanted it to make people feel good,"" he said. He has taken more than 400 virtual portraits since March and said he may open up more sessions for the rest of the year. Wadly Estel and Faith Thomas, who live in Deerfield Beach, Fla., were one of the first couples Mr. Virgo shot. They had been socially distancing for about a week, and were grateful for the excuse to dress up and go outside. But didn't know what to expect. ""The whole shoot was amazing,"" said Mr. Estel. ""We already knew he was a great photographer, but we didn't know what he had in mind."" Not only were the couple happy with the photos, but the excuse to have fun and pose with each other was a welcome distraction during an uncertain time. ""Being able to do that shoot with him gave my girlfriend and I a date night out,"" he said.","With their clients in lockdown, some photographers are turning to virtual photo shoots for weddings and engagements.",e36d03e0-0e2c-595f-bdcf-17f9847ee0fa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/fashion/weddings/oakImage-1592416755813/oakImage-1592416755813-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=397&w=757&s=de00eb2102c63a2a8c19570f8b717a230d95f074a7f2bda3aec0028719a4952f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Brittin and Todd Pittard had a simple wedding ceremony on April 11.

Travel,Millennial Entrepreneurs Give Sleepy Montevideo a Fresh Jolt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/16/travel/montevideo-uruguay-millennial-entrepreneurs-design-fashion-restaurants.html,"Leading the restaurant pack is the retro-chic and market-driven Jacinto, headed by Lucia Soria, an alumna of the famed Argentine chef Francis Mallmann.

On a recent afternoon in Montevideo, a young couple approached the counter at Futuro Refuerzos, a snug sandwich shop that features artisanal breads, house-made spreads and locally sourced meats. The woman was wearing a wide-brimmed felt halt and carried a vintage leather handbag; the man sported tousled curls, forearm tattoos and skinny jeans. There was nothing remarkable about this scene -- stylish 20-somethings ordering gourmet sandwiches in a self-consciously rustic space -- except that it unfolded in a destination that has seemed immune to hipsterdom.

Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, is almost invariably described as old-fashioned, nostalgia-tinged and slow-paced. But in the past few years, an energetic cadre of entrepreneurs with social media proficiency and a keen awareness of global trends has begun to breathe fresh life into this traditionally sleepy South American city. Most are design and trend-savvy millennials who are opening up restaurants and boutiques, organizing street festivals and supper clubs, and daring to stand out in a society that has typically rewarded modesty.

""Thanks in part to social media, young Uruguayans have a global mind-set and are very motivated,"" said Monica Zanocchi, the founder of a popular fashion and lifestyle blog called Couture. ""There are a lot of creative professionals entering the work force, and since established companies can't absorb all of this new talent, they end up becoming entrepreneurs.""

Futuro Refuerzos is led by Fermin Solana, a food writer and rock musician who grew frustrated with the lack of options in Montevideo. ""There was nowhere to eat a decent sandwich beyond the old places that make chivitos,"" he said, referring to the traditional steak sandwiches that are offered in neighborhood joints or local fast-food chains. ""I looked at Santiago and Lima, where the sandwiches are incredible, and decided to take a risk."" Soon after opening in late 2015, Futuro Refuerzos had garnered a following thanks to creations like ""gol,"" handmade pita filled with spiced meatballs, sweet blood sausage and red cabbage. Mr. Solana is part of a group of young restaurateurs and chefs fueling the city's small but growing foodie circuit, which right now includes over a dozen restaurants, cafes and specialty stores (until recently, Montevidean epicures spoke of living in a culinary wasteland, so this is a noticeable improvement).

There is Estrecho, a tiny restaurant in the historic district with simple decor belying a sophisticated lunchtime menu prepared by Cali Diemarch, a chef trained in the United States who invents his daily dishes on the fly, such as a deconstructed chivito made with filet mignon, poached egg, caramelized pancetta and fried onions. La Pasionaria, a concept store and restaurant on a quiet nearby street, recently welcomed a new young chef, Luciana Fia, who makes pasta, ice cream and other food by hand, using fresh, local ingredients.

At Sucre Sale Bistro, a casual spot near downtown, on the back patio of the Alliance Francaise de Montevideo, Florencia Ibarra often sneaks refined dishes like rabbit in mustard sauce with boulangere potatoes into her unfussy Gallic-influenced menu. Leading the pack is the retro-chic and market-driven Jacinto, headed by Lucia Soria, an alumna of the famed Argentine chef Francis Mallmann. Ms. Soria frequently appears on television, participates in food festivals like Degusto and headlines as the top guest chef in supper clubs like Mesabrava.

""Finally, we have good places to eat, good live music and a generation of people who are breaking away from the old molds,"" Mr. Solana said. ""I think the city's lighting up."" Montevideo's new vibe is closely linked to fashion and interior design, as seen in a surge of shops selling locally made clothes, accessories and home accents. Last year, one of the most dynamic new labels, Rotunda, unveiled a sleek multistory boutique in the Punta Carretas neighborhood, complete with its own photography studio, where the owners, Kevin Jakter and Sofia Dominguez, showcase their expanding line of minimalist women's clothing, eyewear, shoes, and jewelry.","Design and fashion-focused millennials are opening restaurants and shops, organizing street festivals and supper clubs, and daring to stand out.",bcf31fd1-40ae-53b7-94d8-c57c406ade47,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/19/travel/19HEADS1/19HEADS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e00091917d4739d6f878b7fa5c1a5d98ace9521af746f486ec5ba247ff87ce33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Leading the restaurant pack is the retro-chic and market-driven Jacinto, headed by Lucía Soria, an alumna of the famed Argentine chef Francis Mallmann.",bcf31fd1-40ae-53b7-94d8-c57c406ade47,N24News/imgs/bcf31fd1-40ae-53b7-94d8-c57c406ade47.jpg,4
Economy,"Job Growth Slowed in July, Signaling a Loss of Economic Momentum",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/business/economy/july-jobs-report.html,"The American economy slowed in July as the pace of hiring eased from the robust rate of the previous two months, a victim of waning momentum and the resurgence of the coronavirus in many parts of the country. Employers added 1.8 million jobs, well below the 4.8 million jump in payrolls in June, the Labor Department reported, after virus-related restrictions caused some businesses to close for a second time. The unemployment rate fell to 10.2 percent. Hours after the report underscored the slowing recovery, talks between administration officials and congressional Democrats on how to pump more aid into the economy were on the verge of collapse. On Friday night, President Trump threatened to bypass Congress and act on his own -- though his power to do so was unclear.

Even with July's gains, fewer than half of the 22 million jobs lost in March and April have been restored. And economists warn that the rest of the lost ground will be a challenge to regain. ""The easy hiring that was done in May and June has been exhausted,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of U.S. economics at Bank of America. ""With many companies not running at full capacity, it becomes harder to get that incremental worker back in."" Over all, the job market reflects the crosswinds buffeting the economy less than 100 days before the presidential election. Retailers continue to file for bankruptcy, while airlines and hotels operate at a small fraction of capacity. Some companies are calling back laid-off employees, even as other employers continue to shed workers. The longer the crisis goes on, the greater the toll for businesses, especially smaller ones. ""We're going to start to see a lot of small businesses fall by the wayside, a lot of people who are unemployed become chronically unemployed,"" said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a Harvard University economist who has written extensively on financial and economic crises. ""We're in very, very dangerous territory.""

She applied for unemployment benefits, but had to wait two months for the payments to begin. Then, in early July, as New York allowed restaurants to open for indoor dining, Ms. Lane was recalled to her job. ""I went back into work, clocked in, went back on payroll, the whole nine yards,"" she said. She had spent just one day there when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo reversed course and prohibited dining inside restaurants. Ms. Lane was laid off again, and found herself back on unemployment and looking for work. The leisure and hospitality industry was hit hard in the downturn and faces new restrictions on bars and indoor dining in states like California, Florida and Texas. Last month, it added 592,000 jobs, or one-third of the net gain for the economy over all.

July's job growth in the industry followed a jump of 3.4 million in May and June, seasonally adjusted, but employment in the field is still 4.3 million below where it was in February.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The retail industry, another hard-hit sector that has seen numerous bankruptcies in recent months, added 258,000 jobs last month. The pandemic's toll on jobs in those categories has hit lower-paid workers especially hard, including millions who depend on tips. For big increases in hiring at restaurants and bars, employees may need to wait until indoor dining is again permitted in states like New York -- something unlikely to occur until a vaccine is found. While the survey of households released on Friday counted 16.3 million Americans as unemployed, the Labor Department has reported that over 30 million are receiving some sort of unemployment benefit. The household survey does not count people as unemployed if they have given up the search for work and are not considered part of the labor force. There are also differences between the Labor Department's definition of unemployment and state requirements for benefits.

Policymakers have noted the differing impact. ""The rise in joblessness has been especially severe for lower-wage workers, for women, and for African-Americans and Hispanics,"" Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said at a news conference in late July. ""This reversal of economic fortune has upended many lives and created great uncertainty about the future."" For some workers, securing a position has meant accepting lower pay. When the pandemic hit, David Espy was a safety manager overseeing the construction of a resort hotel at Walt Disney World in Florida. But in mid-March, when virus-related shutdowns forced entertainment venues to close, Mr. Espy lost his job. After being unemployed for one month, Mr. Espy, 59, was hired by a consulting company called Safety, Solutions and Supply. Before the pandemic, he was making $125,000 a year. Now, he earns $75,000. The new job does not pay him enough to cover his expenses, including two car loans and the mortgage on his house in Valrico, Fla., where he lives with his wife and a 20-year-old son. To make ends meet, he is spending $2,000 of his savings each month.

Even as some employers recall laid-off workers, others are concluding they can no longer stay in business. That has caused financial and emotional damage for owners and employees alike. For Jackie Anscher, the closing of the boutique fitness studio where she taught spinning classes in Long Beach, N.Y., until March meant more than the loss of a job. It was the end of something she was passionate about and halted the deep connections she had built with clients. ""I miss it like I've lost a limb,"" she said. ""What started as an exercise class encompassed so much more. I'm a therapist on a bike. I'm sure a lot of people can relate to the emotional loss."" Ms. Anscher, who taught eight to 10 classes a week, said her financial situation was stable because of her husband's job. But there is nowhere to go to keep teaching as gyms remain closed. ""This was a forced retirement,"" Ms. Anscher, 58, said. ""I'm not ready to retire. I'm waiting to see how I can pick up the pieces."" Stephanie Horowitz, the studio's owner, didn't think the moratorium on classes would be the end of her business, Ocean Ride, when it was imposed in March. She offered spinning classes over the internet, she said, ""but it never took off the way we needed it to.""

By mid-July, the financial drain was too great, and she decided to shut down after seven years. Some of the bikes have been sold, and Ms. Horowitz has been cleaning out the space on the South Shore of Long Island, a few blocks from the Atlantic. Seven part-time workers, including Ms. Anscher, have lost their jobs. ""We were a staple in the community, and we had a good run,"" Ms. Horowitz, 40, said. ""It's emotional. We had just bought new bikes last year. Who knows what the future holds for any of us?""","The ranks of the employed grew by 1.8 million, a drop from the pace of the previous two months, as renewed business closings hampered the recovery.",d724a9dd-9ffe-5d5a-b2bf-a68d445f6595,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/07/business/07markets-brf-jobs-pos/07markets-brf-jobs-pos-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a7ff06a69df91098b2cde13fdfc3b0d40d8727a722e688652b605295101f0504&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An empty plant during their lunch break.,d724a9dd-9ffe-5d5a-b2bf-a68d445f6595,N24News/imgs/d724a9dd-9ffe-5d5a-b2bf-a68d445f6595.jpg,8
Style,"For Lesbians, TikTok Is 'the Next Tinder'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/29/style/lesbian-tiktok-dating.html,"Cas Stephens, left, and Lauren Vlach have been dating since February, when Ms. Stephens saw one of Ms. Vlach's videos on TikTok. ""Proves TikTok is the best lesbian dating app,"" Ms. Vlach captioned their first video together.





On Feb. 3, Lauren Vlach received $8 on Venmo, spread across four $2 payments, from a girl she had never met. Each payment included a block of text; read together, they formed what Cas Stephens, who sent the payments, titled her ""girlfriend application"" to Ms. Vlach. One of the pros of dating her: ""Can do a backflip on a snowboard."" One of the cons: ""Have not seen any Disney movies."" Though she pursued her on Venmo, Ms. Stephens, 20, found Ms. Vlach, 22, on TikTok, where her videos were racking up thousands of views. Ms. Stephens, on the other hand, didn't have a profile picture yet. She figured it would be easier to get Ms. Vlach's attention elsewhere, and seized on the Venmo handle listed in her bio. Her application was accepted, and they went on their first date that night, to watch the sun rise at the Minnesota State Capitol in St. Paul. They have been documenting their relationship on TikTok ever since.

""Proves TikTok is the best lesbian dating app,"" Ms. Vlach wrote in the caption of their first video together. This is a common sentiment on Lesbian TikTok, a corner of the app dominated by funky earrings and references to the indie musician Girl in Red. Like other niches, Lesbian TikTok has its own influencers, cliques, memes and drama. But it is also a hub of community, where those discovering, questioning and embracing their attraction to other women can find friends, solidarity and even love. Like other social media, TikTok connects L.G.B.T.Q. people around the world. And the impulse to convene online has only gotten stronger during quarantine. According to data from the market research firm Sensor Tower, approximately 338 million first-time users downloaded TikTok from the App Store and Google Play from March 1 to May 31. ""A lot of my straight friends will be like, 'Why don't you just meet people in real life?' But it's hard to know if someone's gay sometimes, and it can be kind of anxiety inducing to bring that up with people,"" said Rachael Thompson, 20, who lives in Arlington, Texas, and recently met up with a TikTok friend from New Orleans.

According to documents obtained by Ad Age in October 2019, 69 percent of TikTok users are between the ages of 16 and 24, meaning many users are too young to sign up for certain dating apps (where prospects are location-dependent), much less go to bars (of which are increasingly few designated for lesbians). Plus, many teenagers are still in the closet, or figuring out their sexuality. TikTok is a place where they can do so safely.

Such a companionable environment can engender impressive thirstiness. On practically any video of a pretty girl, there will be multiple comments asking, ""Do you listen to Girl in Red?"", Gen Z's female-specific version of ""Are you a friend of Dorothy?"" That boldness has its downsides, though. ""Nobody should be forced to come out, ever,"" said Olivia Boardman, 20, who met her girlfriend on TikTok during quarantine. She said publicly asking if someone is gay ""puts people in an uncomfortable position."" Ms. Boardman, who was outed when she was 14, said many teenage girls have sought her guidance after seeing her on TikTok. (Her bio: ""C.E.O. of giving advice to gays."") Unlike on Twitter or Instagram, TikTok users scroll through a main feed, or ""For You"" page, of algorithm-generated videos from users they may not follow. This makes for a contained user experience: Someone can join TikTok, and if they search for, interact with or create lesbian videos, their For You page will mainly contain lesbian videos. Straight influencers like Charli D'Amelio may have droves of followers, but a member of Lesbian TikTok (or other niche communities, like Alt TikTok, WitchTok or Frog TikTok) could feasibly never see them. Avery Blanchard, 20, who is known online as Avery Cyrus, said she thought Lesbian TikTok was ""the only TikTok"" when she first joined the app.

""I just didn't even know that there was a regular side of TikTok,"" she said. If Lesbian TikTok were its own world, it could be broken down into many countries with their own national anthems -- songs played over and over in users' videos. There are the cottagecore girls (anthem: Mitski's ""Strawberry Blonde"" or anything by Hozier), the couples (anthem: Girl in Red's ""We Fell in Love in October"") and the aesthetes (anthem: Vivaldi's ""Summer,"" from ""Portrait of a Lady on Fire""), among others. ""It reminds me a lot of if A.O.L. chat rooms could come to life,"" said Shelli Nicole, a writer who has covered Lesbian TikTok for the queer women's website Autostraddle. Influencers like Ms. Blanchard would occupy the largest territory in Lesbian TikTok World. She joined the app last October on a dare; now she has 1.6 million followers. Ms. Blanchard met another TikTok influencer, Soph Mosca, 21, at the popular creator convention Playlist Live in February. They hit it off and are now involved. Ms. Blanchard said she didn't expect TikTok to become a matchmaking site when she first joined. ""I didn't know it had the potential to, like, be the next Tinder,"" she said. ""I never thought I would date someone from TikTok,"" echoed Rachael Espie, 18, who met her girlfriend, Sarah Pye, 20, when she happened upon one of Ms. Pye's videos in her feed. Their relationship is intercontinental: Ms. Espie lives in Glasgow, and Ms. Pye lives in Lake Tahoe, Calif. Lesbian TikTok has had a huge impact on Ms. Espie's life beyond finding her a girlfriend. She said the app inspired her to come out as a lesbian in December 2019.",Young women feeling alienated by dating apps and bar culture are finding love on their For You pages.,adc36dfa-b245-59fb-93cf-50e5261b6ccf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/05/fashion/29LESBIAN-TIKTOK1/29LESBIAN-TIKTOK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c8054cff392eaf8bff7835f8b48db31630124b91c858a0882e0dfd5684422f95&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Cas Stephens, left, and Lauren Vlach have been dating since February, when Ms. Stephens saw one of Ms. Vlach&rsquo;s videos on TikTok. &ldquo;Proves TikTok is the best lesbian dating app,&rdquo; Ms. Vlach captioned their first video together.",adc36dfa-b245-59fb-93cf-50e5261b6ccf,N24News/imgs/adc36dfa-b245-59fb-93cf-50e5261b6ccf.jpg,15
Dance,"Albert Evans, Ebullient City Ballet Dancer, Is Dead at 46",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/25/arts/dance/albert-evans-ebullient-city-ballet-dancer-is-dead-at-46.html,"Albert Evans, a retired principal dancer with New York City Ballet who was praised by reviewers and sought after by choreographers for his almost singular combination of fluid elegance and sinewy muscularity, died on Monday in Manhattan. He was 46. His death, at Mount Sinai Hospital, was announced by the company, which said only that it followed a short illness. Mr. Evans joined City Ballet in 1988 and was named a soloist in 1991 and a principal four years later, becoming only the second black dancer in the company's history to hold that position. The first, Arthur Mitchell, now 81, performed with City Ballet in the 1950s and '60s and in 1969 helped found Dance Theater of Harlem. After retiring from the stage in 2010, Mr. Evans remained with City Ballet as a ballet master, a post he held at his death. He was also a choreographer, a vocation he began pursuing while still an active dancer.

Mr. Evans, who often partnered the ballerina Wendy Whelan, was equally at home in the classical and contemporary repertoire. Prodigiously powerful -- with a running start he had a six-foot vertical leap -- he could cast his body into whatever form, angular or sinuous, a dance required. ""Mr. Evans moves like few others of his generation,"" the critic Claudia La Rocco wrote in The New York Times in 2006. Though he never worked directly with George Balanchine, who died in 1983, Mr. Evans was known in particular as an interpreter of that choreographer's work. His roles in Balanchine ballets included the Cavalier in his ""Nutcracker,"" Puck in ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" and Phlegmatic in ""The Four Temperaments."" Mr. Evans also danced featured roles in ""The Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Romeo + Juliet,"" both choreographed by Peter Martins, City Ballet's ballet master in chief; Jerome Robbins's ""Afternoon of a Faun""; and Robert La Fosse's ""Concerto in Five Movements,"" among other works. Albert Pierce Evans was born in Atlanta on Dec. 29, 1968. In grade school he saw a televised production of ""The Nutcracker"" and was smitten.

""I told my mother it was something I wanted to do,"" Mr. Evans told Newsday in 1995. ""She looked at me and gave me this eye, like, why on earth would you want to be a dancer, run around in tights, fly around the stage?"" But she relented, and young Albert took lessons in ballet and modern dance from Annette Lewis, who had trained under Martha Graham. He later studied in Atlanta with the noted ballet teacher Patsy Bromley. At 13, he won a place in the summer session of the School of American Ballet, City Ballet's training academy. As an older teenager he returned to New York to study at the school full time. In 1988, while Mr. Evans was still a student there, Eliot Feld cast him in ""The Unanswered Question,"" a ballet, set to the music of Charles Ives, that he choreographed for the American Music Festival, a three-week extravaganza that City Ballet presented that year at Lincoln Center. For the same festival, the choreographer William Forsythe chose Mr. Evans to replace an injured dancer in his punk-infused ballet, ""Behind the China Dogs."" Mr. Evans joined City Ballet not long afterward. Mr. Evans's work as a choreographer includes ""Haiku,"" to the music of John Cage, and ""Broken Promise,"" to music by the American composer Mathew Fuerst. Both were performed by City Ballet.","Mr. Evans, a muscular and elegant performer, was only the second black dancer to be named a principal with the company.",b4ef467d-a658-5153-a6eb-8efeeabf642f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/25/arts/25evans-obit-web/25evans-obit-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=648acc2d2655b4d2c8457f937431dc986e59070000f91d64326b88aacd69772c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Albert Evans and other New York City Ballet dancers in Balanchine's ""The Four Temperaments.""",b4ef467d-a658-5153-a6eb-8efeeabf642f,N24News/imgs/b4ef467d-a658-5153-a6eb-8efeeabf642f.jpg,6
Dance,Retiring From Ballet at 26? Dancing Can Get You Only So Far,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/23/arts/dance/silas-farley-new-york-city-ballet.html,"Retiring From Ballet at 26? Dancing Can Get You Only So Far

It was March 1, and Silas Farley was coming off the best season yet at New York City Ballet. A member of the corps de ballet since 2013, his leading roles that winter included a poetic, vivid rendering of Prince Ivan in George Balanchine's ""Firebird,"" opposite Sara Mearns. His potential, it seemed, was finally being realized. And he relished it: Mr. Farley, 26, whose expansive dancing and devotion to the art of ballet was palpable each time he stepped onstage, loved experiencing the weight and responsibility of being a featured dancer. So what did he do next? In his follow-my-own-path-kind-of-way, he retired. ""I was talking to my wife, Cassia, and I just started to express feeling a real sense of fulfillment in that performance aspect of my life, and a greater and greater hunger to cultivate other aspects of my artistry and intellect,"" he said in a phone interview from Charlotte, N.C., where he was visiting his family.

That he has the potential to end up in a leadership role is no great leap. I first laid eyes on Mr. Farley about 11 years ago when he was attending the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet and acting as an unofficial ballet master for his fellow students' choreographic workshop. Tall for his age -- now 6 feet 6 inches he still towers over most dancers -- he wore a unitard with tube socks and referred to himself as ""the cheerleader with a notebook."" Even then, he seemed self-possessed beyond his years. ""It's sad to think about it like this, but it's up to us -- we're the generation that when the people who knew Balanchine die, it's going to be up to us to keep it alive and I get so choked up about it sometimes,"" he told me at the time, referring to George Balanchine, City Ballet's founding choreographer. ""I'm in the cafeteria, and I'm like: 'Guys! Do you realize? We're in the front lines!'"" Mr. Farley, who said he had been considering his dancing future before the coronavirus pandemic hit, will be an artist-in-residence in ballet in the dance division at the Meadows School of the Arts at Southern Methodist University for the 2020-21 school year. He has also started attending Harvard Extension School. After high school, he was accepted to Harvard on a full scholarship; at the time, he chose dance. Now he hopes eventually to study management there. But he'll still maintain a connection with City Ballet and the school. Mr. Farley, who serves on the board of the George Balanchine Foundation, will continue his work on the company's podcast. In his segment, ""Hear the Dance,"" he explores the company's history and repertory. He has taught at the school for years -- in 2012, he and another dancer were chosen to be teaching fellows there -- and will continue to do so when he can.

As a student, Mr. Farley was ""a very tall, beautiful looking young man, very regal,"" the school's chairman of faculty, Kay Mazzo, said. ""He had this hunger, and he wanted to learn as much as he could and pass it on. He's been so involved with the history of ballet, and I think he wants to be such a big part of its future, which he will be -- an important part of it. He is just the epitome of really taking one's art form to the highest level."" He'll also continue to choreograph. In keeping with these social distanced times, he has created digital dances for the Works & Process virtual commissions project, a Guggenheim series (out this summer) and the Church of the Heavenly Rest in New York; he will also create a piece for the Washington Ballet. ""It's wild -- I've become a dance filmmaker because of all that's happened,"" Mr. Farley said. ""I'm able to be right at the cutting edge of what's happening in the art form because we have to adapt. We have to think creatively."" Mr. Farley, who hails from Charlotte -- he grew up in a house with nine people including his parents -- knows how to do both. ""We need to keep the art form thriving, not just on life support,"" he said. ""I want to be part of that. So if that means it's Zoom, let's do it. If that means it's socially distanced and I teach the same class three units a day just to get the same amount of students through as one, I'll do it. Whatever it takes."" While visiting his family at his parents' spacious new townhouse in Charlotte -- a gift from Matthias, his brother, who plays for the New York Jets -- Mr. Farley spoke about his plans and hopes for his former company. What follows are edited excerpts from that conversation.

What interests you in dance apart from actually dancing? From the beginning I knew I wanted to be a dancer and a teacher and a choreographer and a ballet master and a scholar. And I love performing. I really do feel like I'm still at the height of my powers of what I can do as a dancer. I can use movement as illustration as opposed to movement as performance. That's more exciting to me than continuing the rhythm of doing class, rehearsal, performance. And I couldn't have said that until coming off the winter season. What did you love about it? I got to do multiple performances of all of the different parts and to grow in them and find nuances in the choreography. But I also was able to know that that wasn't the ultimately fulfilling thing for this next chunk of my life. I don't doubt that I may have been promoted soon. That's kind of immaterial to me now because I feel really calm and peaceful in my spirit knowing that to do the featured work at that level it has to be your everything. We've had many conversations about race and ballet. How do you see the current moment? Have you attended to any protests? I have not. When a lot of the big protests were happening in Dallas, for example, I was teaching every day for the summer intensive at Dallas Ballet Center. I'm working on a short dance film that's a very direct artistic response to what's happening. I may not be actually in the street protesting at this point, but I feel that the artistic processing of what's happening is as important for that work toward justice. You need the direct action and you also need the artistic space for people to be able to reflect.

Do you feel that the black body is seen differently now and has it changed your relationship with your own? I read Ta-Nehisi Coates's ""Between the World and Me"" a few years ago. He talks about bodies pulled apart -- that there's an irreducible physicality to the violence that racism does. So, yes, I think people are thinking differently about the black body, but to be able to see the whole person: That their blackness is obviously key in who they are, but it's not the totality of who they are. I don't want people to be colorblind. There's that thing people say, ""I don't even see you as black."" And then you almost want to ask them, 'Well, are you blind?'"" What do you hope for City Ballet? My hope is that the company will live up to its foundational vision, which is that it would be half black and half white, which at the very least means epic leaps forward in terms of the racial representation and multiethnic nature of the company. There is now a concerted effort for real work to be done. That you were not just seeing brown and black and Asian faces on the stage, but that these dancers were being cultivated to consistently anchor the repertory. To move beyond the corps de ballet? We've had that. That's fantastic. But meaningfully anchoring the principal ballet roles.

You were being cultivated in a way that could inspire coming generations. Why give that up? I'll be able to cultivate and develop people of all different ethnic backgrounds even more directly by being a teacher and choreographer and scholar. I can lay it down because [the City Ballet dancers] Chris Grant is coming up after me and Kennard Henson is coming up after me and LaJeromeny Brown is coming up after me and Victor Abreu and Preston Chamblee. We need all of this stuff about systemic racial justice to be worked out in the makeup of who's writing the dance history. Who's choreographing the ballets? Who's teaching? Who's training teachers? Who's lecturing? I can take up all of those other dimensions.","Silas Farley, of New York City Ballet, takes his next steps. His goal?

Health,Chicago Woman Is Second Patient in U.S. With Wuhan Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/health/chicago-coronavirus-cdc.html,"A second patient in the United States has been found to be infected with the Wuhan coronavirus, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced on Friday. The patient is a woman in her 60s who had traveled to Wuhan, China -- the epicenter of the outbreak -- and returned to Chicago on Jan. 13. She did not become ill until several days after arriving in Chicago, so officials do not think there is much risk to others who were on her flight home. She did not take public transportation, attend any large gatherings or have close contact with anyone outside her home after returning, officials said. Members of her household are being monitored. The woman was taken to a hospital, but she is doing well and is being kept there primarily to keep the infection from spreading, officials said at a news briefing. They declined to name the woman or the hospital.

The first known case in the United States, of a man in Washington State who had traveled to Wuhan, was reported on Tuesday. ""The immediate risk to the American public is low at this time, but the situation continues to evolve rapidly,"" Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing held by the C.D.C. More cases are expected in the United States, she said.

Sixty-three other people in 22 states are being monitored for possible infection, the C.D.C. said. They are people with respiratory symptoms who may have been exposed to the virus through their own travels or by contact with a patient. So far, 11 of the 63 have tested negative for the infection. The people being tested, called ""patients under investigation,"" were reported to the C.D.C. by state health officials. Samples from the patients -- respiratory fluids and blood -- have to be sent to the C.D.C., which tests them for genetic material from the virus.

The testing takes four to six hours. The C.D.C. is developing kits that officials will send out to the states so that local authorities can do the testing themselves and get results faster. Following a briefing in Washington by officials from the C.D.C. and the National Institutes of Health on Friday, senators said it was most likely that more cases would be identified in the United States. ""The idea is to identify and then contain it,"" said Senator John Barrasso, Republican of Wyoming. ""We're trying to stop and prevent anyone from coming to the United States that may have it,"" he added. The C.D.C. is sending a team to talk to the patient and her family in Chicago, according to Senators Richard J. Durbin and Tammy Duckworth, both Democrats of Illinois. Coronaviruses are worrying because epidemics caused by other members of the viral family, SARS and MERS, have had high death rates: 10 percent for SARS, and about 35 percent for MERS. It is too soon to know the death rate for the new virus. Although influenza kills more people every year, its overall mortality rate is only about 0.1 percent. The number of the deaths is high because so many people become infected. The death rate of the Spanish flu in 1918 was about 2 percent. Because of the higher death rates, widespread coronavirus epidemics could take a heavy toll, so the health authorities scramble to stamp them out.

A major concern is that with both SARS and MERS, a few patients inexplicably became ""superspreaders"" who infected huge numbers of other people. At a hospital in Seoul, South Korea, in 2015, one man with MERS transmitted it to 82 patients. The C.D.C. now recommends avoiding nonessential travel to Wuhan. Because the disease has spread beyond Wuhan, travelers to other parts of China should avoid contact with people who are sick, stay away from markets that sell live wild animals -- believed to be the source of the virus -- and wash their hands frequently. Federal health officials are asking people with possible exposure to the virus and who develop symptoms like shortness of breath, cough and fever to call health care providers first, rather than just showing up at a doctor's office, clinic or emergency room. With advance notice, doctors can take steps to prevent the spread of the virus, like isolating patients and putting masks on themselves and the patients. The woman in Chicago followed those instructions, officials said. There is no antiviral drug to treat coronavirus infection, but a medicine called remdesivir has shown promise in animal studies and would be a good candidate for trials in humans, according to Dr. Mark R. Denison, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University. There is also no vaccine to prevent the disease, but researchers at the National Institutes of Health reported on Thursday that it might be possible to develop one ready for testing in people within a few months.",Federal health officials are monitoring 63 other people in 22 states for signs of infection.,c2f35737-7382-5e9b-a11b-36119d43a90c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/24/science/24CDC-CORONAVIRUS1/24CDC-CORONAVIRUS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c956f42f5cde74e8999328668660911afd892eb68a964cd1ad0b7f51d2a1d112&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Passengers arriving at O'Hare International Airport in Chicago on Friday.,c2f35737-7382-5e9b-a11b-36119d43a90c,N24News/imgs/c2f35737-7382-5e9b-a11b-36119d43a90c.jpg,1
Music,Baltimore Symphony Musicians Are 'Stunned' After Concerts Are Canceled,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/arts/music/baltimore-symphony-cancels-summer-season.html,"For months, the management of the financially struggling Baltimore Symphony Orchestra has tried to negotiate cutting the number of weeks it pays its musicians to 40 weeks from 52. And its players have resisted, arguing that such a move would weaken the quality of the ensemble.

On Thursday afternoon the orchestra's management announced that it was unilaterally canceling its summer season -- which was to have begun with a new music festival on June 19.

So the atmosphere was charged when the orchestra gathered in the evening to play their scheduled concert, Beethoven's ""Emperor"" concerto, at its hall in Baltimore.

As the concert began, Brian Prechtl, a percussionist who is one of the chairmen of the players' committee , strode to the front of the stage and announced that the musicians had been shocked that afternoon to learn of the cancellation -- and said that the musicians had been told that they would not be paid after June 16.

Art & Design,"$50 Million for the Hammer Museum, and Fresh Energy for Arts Giving in L.A.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/22/arts/design/hammer-museum-los-angeles-philanthropy.html,"LOS ANGELES -- The television producer Marcy Carsey -- whose hits include ""The Cosby Show,"" ""Roseanne"" and ""3rd Rock From the Sun"" -- typically directs charitable donations toward causes like affordable education and women's equality. But now she is donating $20 million of her fortune to an art institution. Ms. Carsey's gift to the Hammer Museum, announced Thursday, is the latest in an unexpected series of cultural investments by wealthy Angelenos. Last year, the filmmaker George Lucas said he would fund a $1 billion Museum of Narrative Art, and the music mogul David Geffen pledged $150 million to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art. Ms. Carsey's donation accompanies a $30 million lead gift to the Hammer's renovation and expansion project from Lynda and Stewart Resnick, the billionaire couple behind POM Wonderful and Fiji Water. Among the factors considered to be driving this philanthropy are institutions with strong leadership and fund-raising strategies; an expanding arts scene, with new galleries and museums; and the migration of artists into town. On Thursday, Frieze, the international contemporary art fair in London and New York, said it was adding a fair in Los Angeles in 2019, reflecting the city's position as a global arts capital. Los Angeles has long produced celebrated visual artists -- Mark Bradford, John Baldessari and Barbara Kruger, to name a few -- and it has recently increased the number of places to see art, adding the Broad Museum; the Institute of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Hauser & Wirth mega gallery. Now, this energetic scene is helping to spur giving. Even the J. Paul Getty Trust -- the world's richest art institution, with a $6.9 billion endowment -- has begun to solicit individual donations from a swelling patron base.

""We've never asked for this kind of money before from our donors -- philanthropy used to be the one element of the ecosystem that was weak -- but L.A. is a different city now,"" said Ann Philbin, the Hammer's director. ""It still has a long way to go before it is as generous and automatic as it is in New York, but we have moved the ball substantially forward."" Art-world leaders say Los Angeles is still working to establish a tradition of cultural philanthropy because the city was founded well after its East Coast counterparts and because movies -- not museums -- have historically been the dominant creative industry. ""We're almost 100 years behind New York -- we're still young by museum and civic standards,"" said Michael Govan, the director at Los Angeles County Museum of Art. ""Philanthropy is growing as institutions are growing.""

Recent charitable contributions could suggest that a new donor class is emerging. That is important now that the city's leading cultural philanthropist, Eli Broad, has announced his retirement from public life. Mr. Broad said he no longer feels so alone in support of the arts. ""You're seeing more and more people getting involved philanthropically,"" he said. Among the next cadre of patrons are the heiress Wallis Annenberg, president of the Annenberg Foundation; the married media executives Robert Iger and Willow Bay; and the financier Anthony N. Pritzker. Ms. Carsey, unlike most art museum donors, is not a collector, although she has served as the Hammer's chairwoman since 2014. She said she felt inspired by the museum's ""programming and its purpose,"" reflected in its mission statement about ""the promise of art and ideas to illuminate our lives and build a more just world."" Hammer fans praise the museum's public screenings, readings, lectures and conversations. The collector Susan Bay Nimoy, who donated $7.5 million to support the Hammer's new annex space in honor of her husband, the actor Leonard Nimoy, who died in 2015, said she is at the Hammer ""three times a week."" Steven P. Song, who recently joined the Hammer's board, serves as chairman of the museum's new Global Council, which aims to expand international giving. ""I asked philanthropists in South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Philippines"" to contribute, he said. ""We so far have a 100 percent acceptance track record."" The three main art museums here are now all run by former New Yorkers -- Ms. Philbin; Mr. Govan; and Philippe Vergne, at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles -- who have imported East Coast fund-raising strategies.

Mr. Govan has raised $450 million toward his building's $650 million new permanent collection building, and he has pushed to cultivate Hollywood by making art glamorous -- namely with the museum's annual art and film gala, whose red carpet last fall included Leonardo DiCaprio, Kerry Washington and Jake Gyllenhaal. (Mr. DiCaprio recently underwrote the cost of 309 LED bulbs for Lacma's outdoor sculpture ""Urban Light,"" by Chris Burden.) ""You have to acknowledge that film is art,"" Mr. Govan said. ""You have to make the case, and I'm not sure museums were making the case."" Where young artists in Los Angeles used to feel they had to go to New York to pursue careers, many are staying put. The city has also become a magnet for artists in neighborhoods like Eagle Rock, Mount Washington, Highland Park, Silver Lake and Echo Park. California Institute of the Arts, the leading art school, reported that 50 percent of graduates in 2015 stayed in Los Angeles; that figure has increased to nearly 60 percent. ""Another few arrive each week,"" said the dealer Jeffrey Deitch, who served as director of MOCA and still keeps a home in Los Angeles. ""The balance has shifted."" Paul Mpagi Sepuya, an artist who was born just east of Los Angeles, said he moved back from New York for more affordable studio space and the network that comes with attending art school at the University of California, Los Angeles. ""I wouldn't be able to make my practice work or do the work that I'm doing in New York,"" Mr. Sepuya said. He has also found a community. ""Every day you go to an event or an opening or a friend's house for dinner, and you run into another artist who you lost touch with in New York,"" he said, ""and you suddenly realize they're also in L.A.""

Artists are coming from all over -- Chris Johanson, a muralist and illustrator, came from Portland; Tala Madani, a painter, from Iran; Oscar Tuazon, known for architectonic sculptures, from Paris; Tacita Dean, a Turner Prize nominee, and Thomas Demand, the photographer, from Berlin. And galleries are opening across the city. Relatively recent arrivals include Spruth Magers, Maccarone and Franklin Parrasch. ""I want to be where this energy is,"" Mr. Parrasch said. ""I've been going to L.A. since the late 80s, and I've never seen it like this. I don't think it's going to go away."" Prominent artists want local representation. ""You have to be here to protect your interests, because the artists are here, and they'll sell with somebody else,"" Mr. Govan said. With people lining up around the block for the Broad, lounging at Hauser & Wirth's hip cafe and trolling exhibitions off the beaten path through last summer's regional art event, Pacific Standard Time, ""Los Angeles is getting to be like the art center of the world,"" said the collector Maurice Marciano of the Guess empire. Mr. Marciano, who recently opened the Marciano Art Foundation in a former Masonic temple, also serves as co-chairman of MOCA, which has raised $100 million of a $150 million endowment campaign. Although Ms. Resnick is a lifetime trustee at Lacma, she said she and her husband felt moved to support the expansion of the Hammer, ""one of the places that we go to be inspired."" The campaign to fund the expansion -- as well as to build endowment and exhibition funds -- has raised $132 million. Since Ms. Philbin became director in 1999, the museum's annual operating budget has grown to $22 million, from $5 million, and its staff to over 200, from 35. ""It's gathering big crowds,"" Ms. Carsey said. ""This little museum can bring together different people from different sections of town and make it feel like a community.""","A thriving art scene is nurturing philanthropy in Los Angeles, and young artists are moving in or staying put instead of heading to New York.",3073f842-cae3-5fb2-b0ac-e0521743b3ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/arts/23LA-ART-02/23LA-ART-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=cd8f3678d6d7cb4d71dc3a29caeec1554fa466a739a97af349c4ecd2ff257528&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ann Philbin, the director of the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles.

Travel,"In the Rainy Season, Savings in Asia and Central America",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/travel/rainy-season-savings.html,"Travelers willing to trade unbroken sunshine for cooling rain showers may want to investigate green season deals. While traditional travel advice often suggests avoiding destinations during their rainy season, hotels and tour providers are now offering compelling reasons to rethink that point of view.

During the rainy season (sometimes called by the more positive moniker ""green season""), travelers are likely to encounter an absence of crowds, a significant drop in prices and unique experiences that aren't found during the high season.

At Tabacon Thermal Resort & Spa in Arenal, Costa Rica, seasonal rain causes hot springs to produce billows of steam for an outdoor sauna effect, and open-air bungalow spa treatments are a peaceful experience on a rainy afternoon. In high season, suites start at $560 a night, but for travel through Oct. 31, three-night suite packages are on offer for $860. At Casa Palopo, a nine-room Relais & Chateaux property on the shores of Lake Atitlan in Guatemala, green season rates start at $184 a night (for travel through Oct. 29) compared to $407 a night in the high season.

Deals are also available in Southeast Asia. The tour company Red Savannah offers a green season itinerary in Cambodia for travel through October. Seasonal perks of the seven-day itinerary ($4,028 for two people, compared to $4,556 during high season) include a pleasant drop in humidity after rain showers and fewer people at major landmarks like the Angkor temples in Siem Reap. High water levels in the Tonle Sap Lake also make it easier to explore its floating villages. ""Life is dictated by the rise and fall of the water,"" said Nick Ray, who leads Red Savannah's team in Cambodia. ""The wet season is the most dramatic; I love exploring the flooded forests in a dugout boat or kayak.""","Resorts in Cambodia, Thailand, Costa Rica and Guatemala are offering packages and lower prices in what is sometimes called the green season.",ae5cf32c-6716-5599-a003-f4275b8b6d4c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/17/travel/17deals1/17deals1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=25a642c76f0cd24484dd3a6639aa96fbfb45fc44440090e6277d692210017501&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The terrace at Casa Palopó overlooks Lake Atitlán and the Toliman, Atitlán and San Pedro volcanoes.",ae5cf32c-6716-5599-a003-f4275b8b6d4c,N24News/imgs/ae5cf32c-6716-5599-a003-f4275b8b6d4c.jpg,4
Media,Felony Charges for Journalists Arrested at Inauguration Protests Raise Fears for Press Freedom,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/business/media/journalists-arrested-trump-inauguration.html,"At least six journalists were charged with felony rioting after they were arrested while covering the violent protests that took place just blocks from President Trump's inauguration parade in Washington on Friday, according to police reports and court documents. The journalists were among 230 people detained in the anti-Trump demonstrations, during which protesters smashed the glass of commercial buildings and lit a limousine on fire. The charges against the journalists -- Evan Engel, Alexander Rubinstein, Jack Keller, Matthew Hopard, Shay Horse and Aaron Cantu -- have been denounced by organizations dedicated to press freedom. All of those arrested have denied participating in the violence. ""These felony charges are bizarre and essentially unheard of when it comes to journalists here in America who were simply doing their job,"" said Suzanne Nossel, the executive director of Pen America. ""They weren't even in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were in the right place.""

Carlos Lauria, a spokesman and senior program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists, called the charges ""completely inappropriate and excessive,"" and the organization has asked that they be dropped immediately. ""Our concern is that these arrests could send a chilling message to journalists that cover future protests,"" Mr. Lauria added. The arrests and charges were reported by The Guardian. Witnesses reported that sweeping arrests during the parade targeted rioters, protesters and journalists indiscriminately. A lawyer representing dozens of people arrested, Mark Goldstone, told The Associated Press that the police had ""basically identified a location that had problems and arrested everyone in that location."" The Metropolitan Police Department in Washington declined to comment Wednesday on why the journalists had been charged along with protesters. Mr. Engel, a Brooklyn-based journalist who writes for Vocativ, a media and technology outlet, was among those charged with felony rioting and released. He said by email on Wednesday that he was unable to comment on the case since it was active, but that he was looking forward to the day he could say more.

The document charging Mr. Rubinstein, who wrote for RT America, an affiliate of the Russian state-run television network, is identical to that charging Mr. Engel: While it says that protesters carrying ""anarchist flags"" were observed smashing large plate-glass windows at businesses and setting a limousine on fire, it does not accuse any individual journalist of criminal activity.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Court documents for Mr. Keller -- who works on the documentary series ""Story of America"" -- and for Mr. Hopard, Mr. Horse and Mr. Cantu -- who are independent journalists -- included similar information. Jeffrey Light, a lawyer based in Washington who has been working on civil rights and first amendment related cases for about a decade, has filed a lawsuit on behalf of 51 plaintiffs arrested that day against officers from the police department and the park police. The suit accuses the police of surrounding and arresting ""not only protesters who had engaged in no criminal conduct, but also members of the media, attorneys, legal observers and medics."" Mr. Lauria, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, said it was all the more alarming that journalists had been arrested. ""A car set on fire, windows broken in downtown businesses: I think that this is important information that the public needs to be informed about,"" he said. He said his organization was concerned about what he called ""the sharp deterioration of press freedom in the U.S.,"" which he linked to Mr. Trump's campaign, noting that the candidate had ""obstructed major news organization, vilified the press and attacked journalists by name with unrelenting hostility."" All those actions were seen to contribute to a threatening climate for journalists covering the election.

The committee had sought to meet with Vice President Mike Pence during the transition, Mr. Lauria said, but that meeting never took place. ""We've been in touch with aides, and we're talking about the possibility of having this meeting in the future,"" he said. Ms. Nossel, of Pen America, also linked the charges to a climate fostered by Mr. Trump. ""Obviously we were girded for worrisome and troubling developments,"" she said. ""But the speed, pace and ferocity of the attacks on journalists, the purveying of falsehoods, the silencing of government and agencies that interface with the public -- for all that to happen in a matter of days puts us on notice that some of the worst fears may not have been so far-fetched.""

Media,"We Have Streaming Revenue, Too, Says NBC. And We Can Prove It.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/18/business/media/nbc-streaming-viewers.html,"We Have Streaming Revenue, Too, Says NBC. And We Can Prove It.

If you run a broadcast network these days, it's easy to feel left out. ""All the excitement is about cable and streaming,"" the chairman of NBC Entertainment, Robert Greenblatt, said in an interview. ""We are the forgotten business on some level."" The talk in the entertainment industry has indeed drifted elsewhere lately, with the streaming giant Netflix luring the super producers Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy away from traditional television with nine-figure deals and Apple starting to shell out the $1 billion it earmarked for streaming content to the actress-producer Reese Witherspoon and other show creators. Earlier this month, Mr. Greenblatt lost a top NBC Entertainment executive, Jennifer Salke, to another free-spending upstart, Amazon Studios, which hired Ms. Salke as its new leader. But Mr. Greenblatt's network is positioned relatively well among the networks. Last week, NBC pulled ahead of CBS in total viewers through the first 20 weeks of the 2017-18 season, the first time it has had the lead since 2002.

Mr. Greenblatt has another reason for optimism: He is holding onto a trove of in-house statistics he believes are the key to proving to advertisers that broadcasters can make the transition to the streaming universe. Nielsen ratings, which measure the number of viewers who tune in for shows at the time of their broadcasts, are down for the networks yet again -- 10 percent this season. NBC has responded by learning to make money from viewers who stream its programs -- and now it is learning how to put a number on it. The key is gathering statistics from services like NBC.com, the NBC app, video on demand and Hulu to determine how much money its shows are pulling in from streamers. Take ""This Is Us."" According to the network's data crunchers, NBC has earned around 47 percent of the revenue generated by its 2016 pilot episode from advertising through digital views. Over all, 44 percent of the revenue NBC has earned from ""This Is Us"" has come through digital viewership. Similarly, the critically acclaimed sitcom, ""The Good Place,"" starring Kristen Bell and Ted Danson, has earned roughly 36 percent of its revenue from digital advertising, NBC said. The new source of revenue is NBC's attempt to make up for a larger decline in advertising dollars. Television ad sales fell 8 percent in 2017, one of the biggest drops in years, Bloomberg reported. That's why executives like Mr. Greenblatt need to make the digital business work sooner rather than later.

Not every show is making big money from digital views. About three-quarters of the revenue NBC made from the 2015 pilot of ""Blindspot,"" for instance, has been earned the old fashioned way. But NBC was less savvy back then in extracting money from viewers who preferred streaming. By the time of the first ""This Is Us"" season, NBC had wised up, striking a deal that allowed it to earn money from Hulu ads shown during episodes of the hit tear-jerker.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Generating revenue from streaming is relatively new for the networks, said Jeff Bader, NBC's president of program planning, strategy and research. ""When I came to NBC five years ago, we were in this place with: How are we going to manage this business that's been in decline?"" he said. ""We were doing everything we could not to be the record industry and have our stuff pirated and not monetized."" Particularly depressing was the number of younger viewers who seemed to be changing their viewing habits.

""For years, we were seeing our average age go up, up up,"" Mr. Bader said. ""Younger viewers were drifting. "" Once the network examined the data, however, it saw that younger viewers hadn't abandoned NBC. They were just watching shows on their own schedules. NBC has intensified its efforts to measure the nontraditional audience with the Winter Olympics. Its latest ratings reports have combined the number of viewers it reaches through broadcast, cable and streaming platforms under a single figure it calls total audience delivery. This is the network's attempt to counter the Nielsen measure, which shows a shrinking Olympics audience. NBC understands the reason for the advertising community's skepticism concerning the number of people who watch shows via streaming, however. ""That is the frustrating part of the whole ecosystem,"" Mr. Greenblatt said, ""because we don't have a third-party objective measuring system that everyone has adopted that we all buy into."" Until that third-party system emerges, Mr. Greenblatt said that his sales department has gone all-in on selling advertisers on a statistical portrait that is prettier than the one painted by Nielsen. ""This started for me purely on looking at viewership numbers, because I wanted to be able to make the argument, 'People aren't just bailing on network TV,'"" he said. ""Then it occurred to us, it's not just a viewership number we're defending. It's part of the business model now and it's going to be move that way more and more.""","The network's entertainment chairman Robert Greenblatt says NBC has learned how to generate more cash from digital views, and keep track of it.",592fa01d-15d6-5e71-b478-bb19cf177adb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/19/business/19nbcdigital-web2/19nbcdigital-web2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=1a99e29f1021a020fdedf77df881892bc1b056c5da09057bbd2f6992ce9f708d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The cast of ""This Is Us"" at the Screen Actors Guild awards last month.

At the Salon International de la Haute Horlogerie, known as SIHH, in Geneva in January, the watchmaker will unveil the hotly anticipated final piece in its Haute Joaillerie Diamond trilogy, the Diamond Outrage.

The Swiss watchmaker hopes it will make an even bigger impact than its predecessors, Diamond Punk (2015) and Diamond Fury (2016), which are covered in diamonds but a world away from the delicate jeweled watches that dominate the market.

The trilogy was the brainchild of Francois-Henry Bennahmias, Audemars Piguet's chief executive. And the result has been a collection of bold creations for a modern woman who happens to have more than half a million dollars to spare.

""We are living in a time when women are the freest they have ever been,"" Chadi Nouri, product management leader, said in a telephone interview.

Fashion & Style,Boghossian Keeps Jewelry in the Family,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/21/fashion/jewelry-boghossian.html,"GENEVA -- From their small, unmarked headquarters, the Boghossian family looks out over the Rhone River, directly facing the globally recognized jewelers of Geneva and their logo-emblazoned waterfront towers. The competition, though colossal, seems to mean little to them and their young high-jewelry brand. Albert Boghossian, 57, the business's animated chief executive, kept me in suspense: No stunning jewels until I had seen the family's personal collection of intricately worked antiques, including a hand-carved coral minaudiere, embossed and enameled medicine boxes, lockets studded with miniature pearl pave and cigarette boxes with mother-of-pearl intarsia. ""Imagine how hard it was to create work like this back then,"" he said as we marveled at an eggshell intarsia compact. ""The light was bad. There was no technology. And yet they did such amazing things, so we have to do something much better with everything we have at our disposal today."" A few Boghossian jewels finally appeared on the table to make the point. A bracelet glowed with enormous emeralds held not by workaday metal prongs but by small petal-shaped emeralds. A lattice of rubies and diamonds crisscrossed a mysteriously leaden cuff. What's that? ""Carbon mesh,"" said Ralph Boghossian, 36, head of research and development, and one of Mr. Boghossian's two nephews in the business.

""We decompose carbon and reassemble it with a different grain so it takes on a feminine sheen,"" he said, somewhat explaining the uncommon jewelry material that was neither metal nor gemstone. Reto Albertalli for The New York Times He added to the table a pair of white-gold flowers with unusual petals. ""Titanium deposits,"" Ralph Boghossian said. ""We fuse them with fiberglass. It's part of our search for new materials and techniques."" The family team collaborates with a group of scientists in Rome to develop such novel materials for jewelry. But in its competition to outdo the artisans of old, it is with gems that their technique dazzles most. Out came an egg-shaped ring: pink opal, rose quartz and pink tourmaline were meticulously hand-carved to dovetail like puzzle pieces, all anchored by a nearly invisible gold setting and one glorious diamond. The patchwork of gemstones is an example of the Art of Inlay collection, using the signature technique that introduced the Boghossian brand in 2008 -- an interpretation of the Taj Mahal's Mughal-era intarsia reimagined for the miniature scale of jewelry. ""When we developed the brand, we wanted to approach jewelry from a different angle,"" Albert Boghossian said as he spun the pink ring between his fingers. ""The Art of Inlay shows our connection to the East, then we wanted to evolve the concept with Kissing Gems."" Introduced in 2012, the Kissing Gems collection also combines stones, laying a portrait diamond (a flatter style than the standard ideal cut) atop a larger stone with almost no visible gold setting, creating a monolithic ring that ""looks like magic,"" he said.

By now, jewels were piling up on the table -- a giant sparkler of a Kissing Gems ring, asymmetrical earrings with multi-carat diamonds, a sapphire-encrusted chalcedony cuff, a lacy necklace of diamond rhondelles topped by remarkable unoiled emeralds. A respectably sized yellow diamond was found forgotten on the showroom carpet floor. Then the showstopper appeared -- and everyone in the room who was not a Boghossian gasped. The bib of pink sapphires, finished just days before and set to have its debut at Jewelry Arabia this week, bore a grape-size diamond suspended from a diamond-encrusted flourish of Boghossian's new Les Merveilles technique. Boghossian introduced this technique, after years of experimentation, at the Biennale des Antiquaires in September: infinitesimal square prongs secure stones in a gradation of sizes, creating a tapered column that gleams on all sides, a swooping strip that looks as if it was made of solid diamonds. The brand may be fairly new to the public, established only eight years ago, but the brothers Ralph and Roberto Boghossian, are the sixth generation in the jewelry business. Originally from Armenia, the Boghossians set up a stone-trading business in Aleppo, Syria, in the early 20th century, then moved to Beirut, Lebanon, where Albert and his brother Jean -- Ralph and Roberto's father -- were born. Reto Albertalli for The New York Times In the 1970s, with the war in Lebanon raging, the brothers moved to Antwerp, Belgium, to sell gems, settling later in Geneva, where they expanded to manufacturing jewelry for high-end brands and private customers. When the younger Boghossians joined their father and uncle in the business, they wanted the family name to become a brand. Since then, the family has capitalized on its connection to gemstones and its multinational history. ""We're people who come from the East, yet it's 40 years that we're working in Europe,"" Albert Boghossian said. ""We blend both civilizations in our thinking and philosophy, where the East brings with it the femininity, the intricacy, the sophistication of the workmanship, like you see in the Taj Mahal or the Alhambra, and the West brings with it the modernity, the avant-garde touch, the innovation. Our jewels reflect those two strengths.""",Generations of gem dealing has produced a high jewelry company that focuses on novel materials and dazzling technique.,a575992f-c14c-5d85-a6eb-be4bf3365864,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/23/style/23BOGHOSSIAN01-INYT/23BOGHOSSIAN01-INYT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=61318a8ca906d1e87f2220fda8bbc66439ee7d82359ee548c0aceb741032aef3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Boghossian headquarters in Geneva, from left, Albert Boghossian, the company's chief executive; Ralph Boghossian, head of research and development, and Roberto Boghossian, head of sales.",a575992f-c14c-5d85-a6eb-be4bf3365864,N24News/imgs/a575992f-c14c-5d85-a6eb-be4bf3365864.jpg,19
Health,Trump Administration Threatens California Over Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/health/abortion-california-insurance.html,"The Trump administration threatened on Friday to withhold federal money from California if the state does not drop its requirement that private insurers cover abortions. In an announcement on the morning of the March for Life, the high-profile annual anti-abortion rights demonstration, the Department of Health and Human Services said it would give California 30 days to commit to lifting the requirement. If the state does not do so, the administration said it will take steps to cut off money from one or more federal funding streams. ""People should not be forced to participate, or pay for, or cover other people's abortions,"" said Roger Severino, director of the Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Health and Human Services. The administration issued a notice of violation, declaring that California was not complying with the federal Weldon Amendment, which says that certain funds can be withheld if a state or local government discriminates against a ""health care entity"" for not providing or paying for abortions.

The announcement was intended as a warning shot to several other states that also require insurers to cover abortion, including New York, Oregon, Washington, Illinois and Maine. ""We're sending a message that if any state has done what California has done, they should expect to be found likewise in violation,"" Mr. Severino said. The California governor, Gavin Newsom, said the state would not change the requirement. ""Despite a federal opinion four years ago confirming California's compliance with the Weldon Amendment, the Trump Administration would rather rile up its base to score cheap political points and risk access to care for millions than do what's right,"" Mr. Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. ""California will continue to protect a woman's right to choose, and we won't back down from defending reproductive freedom for everybody -- full stop."" The California's attorney general, Xavier Becerra, tweeted: ""We will fight this by any means necessary."" In a briefing with reporters, administration officials would not say which funding streams might be cut off or how much money might be involved. Jocelyn Samuels, who served as director of the Office of Civil Rights for H.H.S. from 2014 through the end of the Obama administration, said that billions of dollars could potentially be at stake.

Ms. Samuels noted that the stark language of the Weldon Amendment says that ""none of the funds"" that Congress appropriates for the departments of Health and Human Services, Education and Labor can be made available to a state that is found to have violated the amendment. If the Trump administration wanted to impose a narrower penalty, like withholding funding from a specific health care grant, that might have to be determined by a court, she said. If California is deprived of money because of its abortion coverage requirement, it would be the first time the federal government has withheld funding because of health care provider conscience laws, said Ms. Samuels, who is now the executive director of the Williams Institute at the University of California Los Angeles School of Law. ""This is all uncharted waters,"" Ms. Samuels said, adding that in 2016, the Obama administration evaluated the same California insurance requirement and determined that it did not violate the Weldon Amendment because only the health insurers ordered to provide abortion coverage had standing to object, and none of them had. Mr. Severino cited two religious organizations that had complained that they felt compelled to obtain insurance that included abortion coverage for their employees: the Skyline Wesleyan Church and the Missionary Guadalupanas of the Holy Spirit, Inc. The latter organization, a Catholic order of religious sisters, previously sued the state of California over the requirement, a lawsuit that was dismissed by an appeals court in August. ""I don't know how this makes sense to anybody,"" Mr. Severino said. ""Not only is it the wrong thing to do to force nuns to pay for abortion services for fellow nuns, it's against the law."" President Trump, who once said he was ""very pro-choice,"" has worked to earn the support of anti-abortion groups with a series of actions, including preventing organizations that receive federal family planning money from referring patients for abortions and appointing judges to the Supreme Court who have a record of conservative rulings in abortion cases. Last year on the day of the March for Life, the Trump administration levied a similar accusation against California, saying it violated federal conscience protection amendments with a state law that required religiously-oriented ""crisis pregnancy centers"" to inform women with unintended pregnancies about the option of abortion. But that federal action appeared to be largely symbolic because the Supreme Court had already struck down the California law on free speech grounds. The Supreme Court said recently that it would hear a case in which the Trump administration is trying to allow a range of employers with religious or moral objections to opt out of the Affordable Care Act's requirement that most insurers provide free coverage of birth control.","If the state doesn't stop requiring private insurers to cover abortions, the administration said it will cut off federal funding for certain health programs.",aeeaaec4-cd1a-53ae-870a-a45b8e53bd1b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/24/science/24ABORTION2/24ABORTION2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c6a8478e96e3885e0a91690db47778c57fd6b98c17799915e191d9abee71d076&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Anti-abortion demonstrators, part of the annual March for Life, in Washington on Friday.",aeeaaec4-cd1a-53ae-870a-a45b8e53bd1b,N24News/imgs/aeeaaec4-cd1a-53ae-870a-a45b8e53bd1b.jpg,1
Style,Spirit Halloween Rises from the Dead. Again. And Again.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/12/style/spirit-halloween-costume-store-undead-forever.html,"Spirit Halloween is once again open for business. The store known for selling costumes and spooky fall decor at temporary pop-up locations across the United States is making bullish moves in a brutal year for retail. According to the company, it has opened more than 1,400 storefronts nationwide, more than last year -- even as competitors scaled back significantly because of the pandemic. Party City, for example, slashed the number of Halloween City pop-up stores it is opening this fall by 91 percent. It is almost comforting to see this chain, which is masterful at popping up in recently shuttered storefronts, reappear like clockwork this year, a reminder of seasonal change and the grim reaper of American opportunism, when so many other routines have been disrupted. At one Spirit location, in the husk of a defunct supermarket at an outdoor mall in Richmond, Va., nothing appeared different from previous years, aside from a small sanitizer dispenser near the entrance, decorated with skeletal hands.

There were few visible nods to the many crises that have gripped the country this year, aside from a row of obligatory hazmat suits and a ""Karen"" costume -- complete with a blond wig, binoculars, fake hundred dollar bills, and a T-shirt that read ""CAN I SPEAK TO THE MANAGER?"" The reason for Spirit Halloween's durability is closely linked with its business strategy of taking over temporary leases. The store ""is out of step with most normal retail concepts,"" Andy Mantis, a retail analyst for the firm 1010Data, wrote in an email. ""In 2019, typical party stores generated 29 percent of their annual sales from Labor Day through Halloween."" Spirit, however, ""generated 90 percent over that window,"" he wrote, noting that in 2020, ""Covid-19 driven temporary retail closures earlier in the year did nothing to hurt their sales outlook.""

It's not all buckets of candy for the company, of course. The National Retail Foundation predicts that there will be some $8 billion in Halloween spending this year -- a reduction of approximately 8 percent from last year, which the foundation says will likely result from decreased participation in haunted houses, trick-or-treating and parties.

Mr. Mantis said that Spirit saw a decrease in sales ""in the high single digits"" this September compared to last year, though the peak of the season has not yet arrived. (And that decrease is just a blip, he said, ""compared to the 50-90 percent declines in total discretionary spending during the height of the pandemic"" in the country at large.) Katie Thomas, a retail analyst with the Kearney Consumer Institute, thinks Spirit may struggle with certain headwinds. She noted that customers are looking to streamline their shopping trips to a single destination in order to reduce their exposure to crowds, which could provide ""an overall challenge with specialty stores"" like Spirit, as opposed to big box competitors like Walmart and Target.

Ms. Thomas also believes customers will spend less than usual on costumes and more on home decor, citing the ""go big or go home mentality"" exemplified by Home Depot's massive skeleton. ""Right now on their website, it looks like it's still mostly costume first,"" she said of Spirit. ""I really think that decor is kind of the way to go."" ""It's something that people know they can do, they can really lean in to the decorating. Costume parties and trick or treating, it still feels up in the air, if not unsafe,"" she said.

Spirit was founded in 1983 by a San Francisco dress retailer named Joseph Marver, whose store was struggling to attract customers one October. Inspired by the lines outside of a nearby costume shop, he put all of his dresses in storage and filled his store with Halloween-centric items, which sold quickly. The next year he did the same thing at an empty mall storefront and moved $100,000 of merchandise in a month. He kept at it, adding more storefronts each year, until he eventually sold the business to Spencer's Gifts in 1999. ""I didn't invent temporary sales,"" Mr. Marver told the Seattle Times in 2000. ""But I feel like I invented temporary Halloween."" Two decades later, Spirit has become a Halloween mainstay, its storefronts as emblematic of the holiday's approach as pumpkins on porches. It's also a reliable social media punchline; after the president's Covid-19 diagnosis, someone tweeted an image of the White House adorned with the store's iconic grim reaper logo, captioned: ""Spirit Halloween is ready to make its move.""

In one verse, Mr. Lutsko claimed jokingly that the store promised him ""$1,000 for 100 retweets."" The song ended up receiving nearly 9,000 retweets, and he was excited when a Spirit representative did indeed compensate him by sending several thousand of dollars to Mr. Lutsko's Venmo account. (""His song gave us serious goosebumps so let's just say his Venmo account is significantly happier these days,"" the company said in a statement; it would not reveal the exact dollar amount, however, adding ""some things are just between us and the fog machines."") Mr. Lutsko said he was inspired to write the song after visiting a Spirit location with his wife, a prolific Halloween decorator, in early September; the approach of the holiday offered a spark of excitement amid a year marked by sadness and dreary Covid-19 angst. ""Every year whenever you see that they start doing, like, the Pumpkin Spice Lattes at Starbucks at the beginning of September, it's like 'Oh, they gotta wait till October,'"" Mr. Lutsko said. But this year the sight of ""Spirit Halloween stores opening up at the beginning of September was just like, 'All right, bring it on, baby. Let's get to spooky town.'""",The retailer inspires songs and memes with its near-guaranteed seasonal reappearance each fall. But can it survive this year?,3069045a-ccaa-5f45-99cb-63fdb917aff4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/15/fashion/12SPIRIT-HALLOWEEN-4/12SPIRIT-HALLOWEEN-4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=dd96bf6be33154e450164dae95bc60ed0ae1fe41b1fb6dcc40d3099d04875886&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A creepy clown at a Spirit Halloween store in Easton, Md.",3069045a-ccaa-5f45-99cb-63fdb917aff4,N24News/imgs/3069045a-ccaa-5f45-99cb-63fdb917aff4.jpg,15
Fashion & Style,"9 to 5 Dressing, Updated for 2018",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/fashion/9-to-5-dressing-the-post-1970s-office.html,"As movie buffs already know, ""The Post,"" the Steven Spielberg journalism thriller starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, hits theaters in wide release on Jan. 12. Set in 1971, the film follows the Washington Post's first female publisher, Katharine Graham, and its editor Ben Bradlee as they grapple with the decision to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers. While Mrs. Graham's unshakable grit and hard-won success would not be easy to emulate, her wardrobe in the film, a veritable tribute to 1970s office wear, is easier to mine. And the pussy-bow blouses and A-line midi-skirts look startlingly fresh in 2018. Here, how to wear these retro staples.

With a smart A-line skirt and pussy-bow blouse, a white double-breasted blazer is promotion worthy. Worn with matching white pants and chunky platforms, it channels quite another '70s icon: Bianca Jagger (who most certainly never saw the inside of a cubicle).

The Ferragamo Vara pump has stood the test of time. Introduced in 1978, the polished shoe has the magic ability of going with practically everything, from frayed denim to a throwback skirt suit. These stacked-heel loafers in navy patent leather put a fashion-forward spin on the masculine style. Slip them on and walk straight up that corporate ladder.

Almost nothing is more versatile than a wrap dress. With stack-heel loafers and a structured blazer, this one has a retro vibe that works 9 to 5.

An easy way to earn those stripes (at least the sartorial variety) at the office. The bold color scheme keeps it from feeling dated.

Well,"In Classic Children's Books, a Window to Childhood in Past Centuries",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/29/well/family/in-classic-childrens-books-a-window-to-childhood-in-past-centuries.html,"A hundred years ago, in 1919, the first Children's Book Week was celebrated in the United States. Now, in honor of the centennial, the Library of Congress has made available a free online collection of a hundred children's books from a century ago or more. Take a look at ""The Rocket Book,"" by Peter Newell, an important American illustrator, published in 1912, and enjoy the way the rocket, set off by young Fritz in the basement of a building, travels up through the many different apartments on the floors above. ""The book has a hole in every one of the pages where the rocket bursts a hole through the floor,"" said Lee Ann Potter, the director of the learning and innovation office at the Library of Congress. ""It's so tactile and yet so old."" Or check out ""The Cats' Party,"" from 1871, which reveals in rhyme and rich illustration just what happens when the humans go away. ""The antics of these kittens are as funny today as in the middle of the 19th century,"" Ms. Potter said. ""There's value in that too, to realize that what we enjoy today was enjoyed by our ancestors.""

""I hope this new collection will help open people's eyes to what is in the holdings of our national library,"" Ms. Potter said. ""I'm glad these books exist and have been well taken care of."" And they can take children -- and their parents and teachers -- into a wide variety of stories and conversations and histories. The first public reading of the Declaration of Independence in Massachusetts was performed by Isaiah Thomas, who had been apprenticed at the age of 6 to a printer, and had learned to read, so the story goes, from the blocks as he set type, copying documents before he actually knew the letters. ""He was just learning the shape of the letters and copying what was on the sheet, they even had to build him this little bench to walk back and forth on,"" said Jacqueline Coleburn, the rare book cataloger at the Library of Congress. Thomas, who grew up to be a printer himself, was publishing a patriotic newspaper as the American Revolution approached, and his name was on a British list of those to be executed. And in July 1776, on the way from Philadelphia to Boston, he stood on the steps of the South Church in Worcester, and read the new Declaration aloud to the approving crowds. In the newly independent United States of America, Isaiah Thomas continued in the book trade, and he printed the oldest book in the Library of Congress's new online collection, ""A Little Pretty Pocket Book,"" printed in 1787. The book had initially been co-authored and published in England in 1744 by John Newbery, often described as the founding father of modern children's literature, whose name is enduringly famous because of the Newbery Medal given every year; Thomas initially imported the book, and then began printing it himself, becoming the first American printer to publish specifically for children. Although it came from England, the book is also famous because among its rhyming descriptions of various games, it contains the first mention of one called ""base-ball.""

""Well into the 19th century, most of children's literature in America came from Britain,"" Ms. Coleburn said. ""It wasn't till the 1830s and 1840s that we really focused on producing American books."" And American children's books carried different messages, she said. ""In British books often the message is, be content where you are,"" she said. But with American books, the Horatio Alger story line emerges, she said: ""Be a good person and you can improve your station in life and that will make you happy."" One of the most telling aspects of ""A Little Pretty Pocket Book"" was the caption on the frontispiece, which promised ""instruction with delight,"" Ms. Coleburn said, and which was connected to new ideas circulating in the Enlightenment about how to educate children. ""They were starting to catch on to the idea that if you entertain a child, it's easier to teach him,"" she said. That approach appeals to some adults, too -- notably the latest ""Jeopardy!"" champion, James Holzhauer, who said he gathered nuggets of trivia he needed for the game show by reading children's books.

Classic children's books can be beautiful and entertaining in their own right, and can show off literary and artistic genius in ways that remind us that some aspects of childhood and some ways in which children appreciate stories and pictures connect different generations and reach across eras. On the other hand, classic children's books can easily present images and story lines that today's parents find problematic, either because of what is printed or illustrated on the page or because of what -- and who -- is left out. ""We have woken up to the fact that our classic children's stories don't give us diversity by any stretch of the imagination,"" said Maria Tatar, professor of folklore and mythology at Harvard. That's part of the challenge and the opportunity that parents and teachers can find in the heritage of children's books, a chance to talk about context and the realities of history, with respect to racial and ethnic differences, and gender roles (""A Little Pretty Pocket Book"" was packaged with a ball for boys or a pincushion for girls).

""Talking to children about who is represented and who is not represented, that may feel like it's way too serious,"" said Dr. Tatar, who was the co-editor with Henry Louis Gates of ""The Annotated African American Folktales."" In fact, even young children can have those conversations, she said, and part of the adult's responsibility is to make them happen in a way that's easy and comfortable for the child. ""What better place than a book, a once-upon-a-time,"" she said. ""This is not here and now, it's a place we can go in our imaginations, we can think about what if."" ""We're celebrating the fact that these books provide us with the opportunity to have conversations about what is appropriate or inappropriate, that they help us understand a different time,"" Ms. Potter said. The library will be posting a blog next week specifically about approaches teachers might take to introduce these books to students and put them in context. In 19th-century children's literature, ""the books are full of objects and they're full of games, and for little history lessons they can be incredibly valuable,"" said Patricia Crain, a professor of English at New York University, and the author of ""Reading Children: Literacy, Property, and the Dilemmas of Childhood in Nineteenth-Century America."" ""The images can be really beautiful and can be a reminder that children have always been educated through images.""","Rare children's books, made available online through the Library of Congress, show both the constants and the evolution in children's literature.",f3c0aa67-5a1c-5312-91cd-853e061c2be6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/29/well/family/klass-books1/klass-books1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d3c38c384f73589a4b8e7cf6b0b59f01bad888be8f4d3687f5d42db93719b00f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Classic works of children's literature from the Library of Congress collections.,f3c0aa67-5a1c-5312-91cd-853e061c2be6,N24News/imgs/f3c0aa67-5a1c-5312-91cd-853e061c2be6.jpg,18
Economy,Fed Minutes Show Some Concern on Economic Outlook,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/business/economy/fed-minutes-december-rate-increase.html,"WASHINGTON -- Janet L. Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, marshaled a strong consensus among Fed officials for the momentous decision to raise the central bank's benchmark interest rate last month, but concerns among policy makers about the strength of economic growth could slow the march toward higher rates. Officials are focused on the persistence of sluggish inflation. While rising prices are unpopular, central bankers see benefits in moderate inflation. But for almost four years, there has been less inflation than the Fed's 2 percent annual target; some policy makers worry that higher interest rates will not help, according to an official account of the December meeting published on Wednesday. For some of those officials, the decision to raise rates was a ""close call,"" the meeting account said. It added that ""many participants remained concerned about the downside risks attending the outlook for inflation."" And it described general agreement among the 17 officials who make up the Fed's policy-making body, the Federal Open Market Committee, to keep a close eye on prices.

By the time the Fed formally announced its December decision to raise interest rates, ending the seven-year period during which it held short-term rates near zero, the attention of investors had already shifted to the question of how quickly the Fed would raise rates a second time, and a third. Fed officials forecast in December that they were likely to raise rates by one percentage point in 2016, most likely in four quarter-point increments. Referring to that prediction in an interview on CNBC Wednesday, Stanley Fischer, the Fed's vice chairman, said that ""those numbers are in the ballpark."" Not everybody is necessarily in line with that thinking, though. The meeting account, released after a standard three-week delay, did not address the issue directly, but its description of the internal debate underscored differences on the timing and frequency of future moves. In particular, it raised the question of how much further Fed officials are willing to raise rates without clear evidence the pace of inflation is also rising.

Laura Rosner, an economist at BNP Paribas, said the minutes provided less information than she expected about the Fed's plans, but she still put the odds of a March increase at 80 percent. She said she did not expect the questions about inflation to be resolved by then, but she wrote on Wednesday that ""inflation data released leading up to the March meeting are unlikely to increase worries."" Ms. Yellen and her allies have already demonstrated they are willing to raise rates despite the uncertainty. Other analysts, however, said they were surprised by the Fed's emphasis on its inflation concerns. ""Given all their worries about inflation, it's a wonder they even hiked at all,"" wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase. ""Absent from this discussion was any sense that further tightening in the labor market would bolster their confidence in the inflation outlook. Instead, they wanted proof: not only expected progress, but also 'actual' progress on their inflation objective."" Mr. Feroli said a March raise now depended, in his judgment, on data showing increased inflation. The minutes described Fed officials as optimistic that the economy would continue its steady, but slow, growth this year. They generally predicted the strength of the domestic economy, fueled by increased consumer spending, would outweigh the weakness of the global economy, which has limited foreign demand for American products. They also expected growth to be strong enough to drive continued improvement in labor market conditions -- fewer people without jobs, fewer people in jobs that they do not like and, perhaps most important, more workers able to obtain raises. As employment increases and wages rise, the Fed expects inflation to rise more quickly, in keeping with a longstanding pattern. A majority of Fed officials, led by Ms. Yellen, view this pattern as sufficiently reliable that they decided to start raising rates before it actually happened. ""Nearly all participants were now reasonably confident that inflation would move back to 2 percent over the medium term,"" the minutes said. And because the influence of monetary policy is gradual, they worried that waiting to raise rates would risk driving economic growth to unsustainable heights or fostering a speculative bubble.

The Fed, however, has repeatedly forecast that inflation would rise, and it has repeatedly been wrong. Some officials are concerned the central bank is once again overestimating the economy. Lael Brainard, a Fed governor, has argued that her colleagues are underestimating the potential deflationary impact of global economic weakness. The minutes, describing this view, said a couple of officials ""worried that a further strengthening of the labor market might not prove sufficient to offset the downward pressures from global disinflationary forces."" The Fed has taken comfort in the stability of inflation expectations, which show Americans have not changed their views about the likely level of future inflation. But that blanket has been fraying for some time. Measures of expectations derived from asset prices are far weaker than survey measures, and in recent months, some of the survey measures have also shown signs of declining. The minutes said several officials expressed ""unease"" about that decline, while others saw benign explanations, arguing that lower oil prices, for example, were exerting an influence that would soon fade once the energy market stabilized and began to rise. So far, that has not happened.","As they moved to raise interest rates in December, some Federal Reserve officials were cautious in their assumptions about the months ahead.",ed71e36e-0d32-5d63-8466-46ab20c29519,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/07/business/07fed-web/07fed-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=56c4ae64615825052ff2fc6f68646e9345784a7b8c3007575004df3b0ad70c84&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Janet L.

Welcome, earthlings, to the place of no return: a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong, not even light can escape it. This is a black hole. It's O.K. to feel lost here. Even Albert Einstein, whose theory of general relativity made it possible to conceive of such a place, thought the concept was too bizarre to exist. But Einstein was wrong, and here you are. You shouldn't be here. Surely you will be pulled in . But fear not, dear earthling: Your brain has taken millions of years to get here, and it's ready for this gaze into the darkness. So let's get started.

The notes stayed in the galaxy and never reached us, but we couldn't have heard them anyway. The lowest note the human ear can detect has an oscillation period of one-twentieth of a second. This B flat's period was 10 million years. The ""songs"" of black holes may be responsible for a declining birthrate of stars in the universe. In clusters of galaxies such as Perseus, the home of NGC 1275, the energy these notes carry is thought to keep the gases too hot to condense and form stars.

Astronomers have evidence for black holes in nearly every galaxy in the universe Although no black hole is close enough to Earth to pull the planet to its doom, there are so many black holes in the universe that counting them is impossible. Nearly every galaxy -- our own Milky Way, as well as the 100 billion or so other galaxies visible from Earth -- shows signs of a supermassive black hole in its center. Moreover the bigger a galaxy is, the more massive is its central black hole. Nobody knows why.

The dramatic transformation starts when a massive star runs out of fuel. As the star begins to collapse, it explodes. The star's outer layers spew out into space, but the inside implodes, becoming denser and denser, until there is too much matter in too little space. The core succumbs to its own gravitational pull and collapses into itself, in extreme cases forming a black hole. Theoretically, if you shrank any mass down into a certain amount of space, it could become a black hole. Our planet would be one if you tried to cram Earth into a pea.

On March 28, 2011, astronomers detected a long gamma ray burst coming from the center of a galaxy 4 billion light-years away. This was the first time humans observed what might have been a dormant black hole eating a star. No matter what a black hole eats -- a star, a donkey, an iPhone, your grammar teacher -- it's all the same to the black hole. ""A black hole has no hair,"" the physicist John Archibald Wheeler once said, meaning that a black hole remembers only the mass, spin and charge of its dinner. The more a black hole eats, the more it grows. In 2011, scientists discovered one of the biggest black holes ever, more than 300 million light-years away. It weighs enough to have gobbled up 21 billion suns. Scientists want to know if the biggest black holes are the result of two holes merging or one hole eating a lot. But scientists don't know how they grew so large.

To find the darkness, follow the light Light can't escape a black hole, so seeing what's inside one is impossible. Getting a picture of a black hole's edge is difficult, and getting a clear picture is something else entirely. And until now, it has never been done. So far, scientists have detected black holes only indirectly, by their signatures, such as a gamma ray burst, supernova or, perhaps, an object on the brink of a black hole's event horizon. Typically, if tremendous energy is emanating from a massive core at the center of a galaxy, the core is probably a black hole. The Event Horizon Telescope, the one Sheperd Doeleman and his colleagues used to photograph the black hole in the galaxy M87, features a cast of more than 100 scientists on four continents and one very important crystal used to calibrate atomic clocks. In April 2017 scientists staked out eight telescopes atop mountains on four continents, synchronized them, pointed them at the sky and waited. And so they brought Einstein's monster, the black hole, into view for the first time.

A giant magnet in Europe will not destroy the planet Before the European Organization for Nuclear Research fired up the Large Hadron Collider in 2008, critics worried that smashing together protons in a 17-mile ring underground would create a black hole that would swallow the earth. Scientists had smaller ones in mind. In theory, the search for the smallest particles in the universe might kick up mini black holes in the collider's underground tubes, enabling researchers to observe general relativity and quantum mechanics in action, and perhaps open the door to solving the firewall paradox. A decade earlier, similarly apocalyptic worries arose over Brookhaven National Laboratory's Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider. The center's scientists squelched these concerns by pointing out that, according to their calculations, ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays were already penetrating the atmosphere and would have created about 100 tiny black holes on Earth every year. If tiny black holes were a genuine problem, Earth would have collapsed into infinity long ago. Still, in June 2008, a safety review proclaimed the L.H.C. safe. Experiments commenced, the Higgs boson was found and Earth survived after all.",Welcome to the place of no return — a region in space where the gravitational pull is so strong that not even light can escape it.

Technology,Huawei Founder Slams U.S. Charges as 'Politically Motivated',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei-bbc.html,"BEIJING -- Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, has accused the United States of having political motivations in leveling criminal charges against the company and his daughter, a top Huawei executive.

The comments, made in an interview with the BBC that was published Monday, mark a rhetorical escalation. Mr. Ren and the firm had previously declined to say much on the case, citing respect for the legal process. But he appears to be sharpening his language as a hearing nears on whether his daughter should be sent to the United States to stand trial.

""I object to what the U.S. has done,"" Mr. Ren told the BBC. ""This kind of politically motivated act is not acceptable.""

Late last month, the Justice Department unveiled sweeping charges against Huawei and its chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou, outlining yearslong efforts by the Chinese firm to steal American industrial secrets, obstruct a criminal investigation and evade economic sanctions against Iran.","Ren Zhengfei had previously avoided passing judgment on the case, citing respect for the legal process.

Fashion & Style,Bernard Arnault Just Bought Tiffany. Who Is He?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/fashion/bernard-arnault-tiffany-lvmh.html,"A field guide to the man behind LVMH, who just engineered the biggest deal in luxury -- and isn't done yet.

On Monday morning LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the world's largest luxury company, announced it had proposed to -- and been accepted by -- Tiffany & Company, the American jeweler made famous by its blue boxes, Truman Capote and Audrey Hepburn. The man behind the largest-ever deal in luxury: Bernard Arnault, founder, chairman and largest shareholder of LVMH. If you don't know who he is, you should. Mr. Arnault, 70, is one of the richest men in the world -- worth $106.9 billion as of Monday morning, according to Forbes. He is French, and the godfather of the modern luxury industry. He pretty much invented the whole idea (this is not overselling it).

Though his father made his money in the construction business, Mr. Arnault saw very early on the opportunities in taking a group of family-run artisanal companies, professionalizing them and leveraging their strength to the group benefit. He says he figured it out when he came to New York in the 1980s, got into a cab and discovered that his driver had never heard of de Gaulle, but he knew Dior. In that moment, the idea for an empire was born.

LVMH, a group of 75 -- 75! -- brands that span fashion, watches, jewelry, wine, spirits, retail, beauty and hospitality. There's no way to list them all, but they include: Dior, Vuitton, Fendi, Celine, Pucci, Marc Jacobs, Hennessy, Dom Perignon, Bulgari, Tag Heuer, the Paris department store Le Bon Marche, Sephora, the hotel group Cheval Blanc, Moet & Chandon, Fenty, DFS Group, Make Up For Ever and Krug (to name a mere few). LVMH is three times larger in market capitalization than its closest rival, Kering (owner of Gucci, YSL and Alexander McQueen), and five times larger than Richemont (owner of Cartier, Chloe and Net-a-Porter). It is the second-most valuable company in Europe, with a market capitalization of more than 200 billion euros, after Royal Dutch Shell, the oil and gas company. How he did it Mr. Arnault took the principles of the masters of the universe -- the corporate raiders of New York in the 1980s -- and applied them to European luxury. He started with a bankrupt French textile company called Boussac that he bought from the French government in 1985 and that happened to include a dusty old house called ... Dior. He sold everything else off, but kept Dior and built from there. In 1989 he engineered a hostile takeover of LVMH that so freaked out the French business community they gave him the nickname ""the wolf in the cashmere coat.""

He created the flagship store-as-brand-temple, and embraced the model of taking heritage names deeply embedded in European history and installing buzzy young designers at the top to shake up the image and give them cultural currency. But he has always placed the brand above the individual, a decision that makes him, depending on who is watching, either a genius or a bloodsucker on the body of creativity. However, Mr. Arnault clearly loves his brands -- he is given to stroking the handbags of which he is particularly fond -- and will invest in loss-making names for years until he gets the creative balance right. What's he really like? Only close friends know for sure! He is tall -- about 6' -- thin and soft-spoken, collects contemporary art (it's all over the LVMH headquarters on Avenue Montaigne in Paris), plays tennis seriously and is a talented pianist. He is also very competitive. He has said he wanted the No. 1 company, because he realized he couldn't be the No. 1 tennis player or concert pianist. However, when he was wooing his second wife, the Canadian pianist Helene Mercier , he did it by playing for her. She said she realized he was serious about her when she could see how nervous he was. In the company, he is mostly referred to as ""B.A."" When his colleagues are asked to describe him, they generally give a Gallic shrug and say, ""He's from the North,"" as though that explains everything. You know: It's colder and grayer up there in Normandy.

He has two children from his first marriage, Antoine and Delphine, and three from his second: Alexandre, Frederic and Jean. Four of them work at LVMH. Antoine is chief executive of Berluti, chairman of Loro Piana and head of communications and image for the whole group; Delphine is executive vice president of Louis Vuitton, member of the executive board of LVMH and spearheaded the LVMH prize for young designers, the most lucrative emerging designer prize in fashion. Alexandre is chief executive of Rimowa, the luggage brand, and Frederic is strategy and digital director of Tag Heuer. One of the most popular games among LVMH Kremlinologists is ""who's the successor?"" So far, it's still anyone's guess. With whom does he hang out? The power crowd. He is such good friends with Nicolas Sarkozy, the former president of France, that he was a witness at Mr. Sarkozy's 2008 wedding to Carla Bruni, and is also close to the current French president, Emmanuel Macron, and to Tony Blair, the former British prime minister. He also knew President Trump during their time in New York in the 1980s, and was among the first international business leaders to visit the new president at Trump Tower in early 2017. Last month, Mr. Trump cut the ribbon on a new Louis Vuitton factory in Texas. Mr. Arnault also was close to Karl Lagerfeld, the Chanel and Fendi designer who died in February. Does he ever lose? Rarely (when he plays tennis with Roger Federer, perhaps) -- and when he does he usually still makes money out of the deal. He fought a handbags-at-dawn battle with Kering (then PPR) for Gucci in 1999, which he eventually lost, and in 2010 began buying Hermes stock, much to the Dumas family's dismay. The following year the Hermes chief executive, Patrick Thomas, effectively compared the unwelcome approach to a ""rape"" (they eventually made peace and Mr. Arnault backed off, after reaping a tidy profit from his investment). He also suffered a quasi-black eye when the French media discovered in 2012 that he had applied for a Belgian passport during the socialist administration of President Francois Hollande, though he said it was only for estate planning purposes. Is he done buying? Don't be silly. This year alone he made a deal with Rihanna to open a new luxury house with her, and next year LVMH is reopening La Samaritaine department store/hotel/spa on the Right Bank in Paris -- after a 15-year, $1 billion renovation. This year he also signed a joint venture with Stella McCartney, so she's part of the fold, too, and has become a special adviser to the chairman for sustainability. Once upon a time he considered buying Armani, and rumor has long had it that he would dearly love to add Chanel to the group. Outreach! Recently (and somewhat under the influence of his children), the wolf is starting to change his pelt. In 2014 he built the Fondation Louis Vuitton in the Bois de Boulogne, an extraordinary Frank Gehry-designed museum for contemporary art (and his own corporate contemporary art collection) that will ultimately become a gift to the city of Paris. In addition, he has pledged EUR200 million to the restoration of Notre-Dame after the fire earlier this year, and LVMH has donated $11 million to fight the wildfires in the Amazon rainforest. He has also been much more vocal about sustainability. So now he's Mr. Nice and Cuddly? Well, I wouldn't go that far.","A field guide to the man behind LVMH, who just engineered the biggest deal in luxury — and isn't done yet.",a4ef3e60-0b85-5e68-9556-e3ff09b84a37,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/25/world/25Arnault-explainer/25Arnault-explainer-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b5443268ae1111ada9cfabd9049799b1bf3172abacf531a4ccf1ec9e1eb481ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bernard Arnault and his spouse, Hélène Mercier, earlier this year.",a4ef3e60-0b85-5e68-9556-e3ff09b84a37,N24News/imgs/a4ef3e60-0b85-5e68-9556-e3ff09b84a37.jpg,19

Sports,Here Are Key Points About M.L.S.'s Return,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/sports/soccer/mls-is-back-tournament.html,"Major League Soccer is the first of North America's major men's professional sports leagues to return, with a makeshift mini-tournament beginning on Wednesday night. Here are the hows, whys and wheres for the event, which is taking place in Florida, one of the country's coronavirus hot spots. The caveat is that the league's plans could easily change: In the last few days, a game has been postponed and a team has dropped out of the field. The opener is a match between Orlando City S.C. and Inter Miami C.F. on Wednesday evening at 8 p.m. Eastern. Games will continue daily until the end of the group stage on July 23, and, to combat the summer heat, some will be played at the eye-opening hour of 9 a.m. Where did things stand when we left off? Each team in M.L.S. managed to play two games before the pandemic halted the season. Atlanta, Kansas City, Minnesota and Colorado were 2-0 in the early action. Cincinnati, New York City F.C. and the two expansion teams, Nashville and David Beckham's Inter Miami, had not earned a point. What's the format of the new tournament? The N.H.L. will head straight to the playoffs, the N.B.A. will briefly resume its regular season, and the N.W.S.L. is holding a short cup. M.L.S. plans to use a mix of these elements.

Initially, teams will play in a newly created event, the suitably named ""M.L.S. Is Back Tournament."" Teams are divided into groups and will play three games each. The top two or three teams from each group, plus some of the best runners-up, will advance to the round of 16. The group stage lasts until July 23, followed by a single-elimination playoff, with the final on Aug. 11. M.L.S. has not announced a firm schedule, but the plan is to resume the regular season, preferably with teams back playing in their home stadiums. While there will be no fans at the Florida tournament games, the league hopes to begin reintroducing fans at some point this season.

What's being done for safety? Players were tested for the virus before arriving, and testing, both exhaustive and expensive, will continue during the tournament. Players and staff on the bench for games must wear masks. Exchanging jerseys and kissing the ball will be forbidden. And ""players, coaches and officials are asked to exercise care when spitting or clearing their nose,"" the league's protocols say. Will teams be motivated for the new event? There are several incentives for teams to do well in the new tournament. The three group stage games will count toward the regular season once it resumes. There will be prize money. And the winner of the tournament will earn a berth in next year's Concacaf Champions League. About a dozen M.L.S. players have tested positive for the Covid-19 virus so far. Unfortunately, 10 of them are on the same team, F.C. Dallas. Because of this, the league decided to remove Dallas from the tournament, although the team will presumably return when the regular season resumes. On Tuesday afternoon, the second scheduled game of opening day, Nashville-Chicago, was postponed because five Nashville players had tested positive after arriving in Florida. Are all the players coming? The vast majority are, but a few have opted out. Like the N.W.S.L., which resumed without Megan Rapinoe, M.L.S. will be down one of its marquee players: Carlos Vela of L.A.F.C., the reigning most valuable player. ""It is in the best interest of the health of my family to stay home and be with my wife during what is a risky pregnancy,"" he said in a statement. At least a few other players and coaches have gone to Disney World but expressed trepidation. Matt Lampson, a goalkeeper for the Columbus Crew who is a cancer survivor, tweeted last week: ""For everyone in the 'These are pro athletes. There is no risk. Nothing happens to them if they get the virus' camp -- I am high risk. And I know for a fact there are multiple others at #MLSisBack that are as well -- including other players on their way here. This is serious.""

Given the withdrawals, how concerned is the league? Commissioner Don Garber remained upbeat even after the news of F.C. Dallas's withdrawal. ""We have 550 players that have already been tested, and 13 of them have tested positive,"" he told ESPN, before news of the further positive tests on Nashville's squad. ""Right now it's an extremely low percentage. The players that are there are safe, they're comfortable, they're training, they're eating, they're recreating."" He did also say, ""We're going to have to keep a close eye on it."" What else will be different? M.L.S. will not play the national anthem before games. The stated reason is that there would be no point without fans, but the anthem has also become a flash point for controversy amid the Black Lives Matter protests. Many athletes have said they plan to kneel rather than stand for the anthem, and others, including President Trump, have criticized those plans. Garber reiterated last month that ""If a player is looking to express their right to kneel during the national anthem, they should have the right to do so."" Are there financial concerns? At least four M.L.S. teams applied to receive money from the Paycheck Protection Program, a federal loan program designed to help small businesses. The four teams, D.C. United, Inter Miami, Orlando and Seattle, asked for loans of between $1 million and $5 million. What about the lower leagues? The U.S.L. Championship, which includes a number of M.L.S. farm teams, is to begin play on Saturday, with games at home stadiums. The next lower division, League One, is to being a week later. League Two has been canceled this year.","The league removed F.C.

Sports,Hacker Who Leaked Soccer's Secrets Loses Extradition Hearing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/sports/hacker-football-leaks-soccer.html,"A computer hacker who for years published the innermost secrets of the global soccer industry -- revelations that have shed light on questionable behavior by some of the sport's most influential figures and top clubs -- was told on Tuesday that he would be extradited to Portugal, where he faces charges linked to his activities.

Lawyers for the man, Rui Pinto, 30, immediately said they planned to appeal the decision made by a court in Budapest, where he was arrested in January. They argued that his whistle-blowing activities far outweighed any crimes he might have committed in securing the documents. In Portugal, Mr. Pinto is charged with an extortion attempt in 2015 on a secretive investment fund that had bet millions of dollars in the player transfer market.

The leaks first emerged in 2015, on a website called Football Leaks, before Mr. Pinto, a year later, joined with the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel and a group of other European news media organizations to slowly disseminate related news articles. They painted an unflattering picture of an industry troubled by questionable efforts to avoid millions of dollars in tax, flagrant rule breaking by some top clubs and an alleged sexual assault by one of soccer's biggest stars, Cristiano Ronaldo.

While the Portuguese authorities want to put Mr. Pinto on trial, their counterparts in France and Belgium have said they want to work with him, to gain access to the enormous database he has compiled as they continue investigations into figures in the soccer world. The ruling in Hungary makes that difficult, said Francisco Teixeira da Mota, who is part of a legal team that includes William Bourdon, a French lawyer who previously represented the national security whistle-blower Edward Snowden.",Rui Pinto will appeal the decision made by a court in Budapest.,13ae9b42-0798-5d46-a04d-1ef7b79cd1fd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/05/sports/05hackerWEB1/merlin_151649373_2ba10bad-b498-4f8d-ba92-ad28d8af8a69-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=9a6326d81eb518c8ce31e4dc6889615e9c670ccdf65277b0ebd805c501193021&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The computer hacker Rui Pinto was taken to court in Budapest on Tuesday.,13ae9b42-0798-5d46-a04d-1ef7b79cd1fd,N24News/imgs/13ae9b42-0798-5d46-a04d-1ef7b79cd1fd.jpg,9
Television,Josh Thomas's Week: 'Twitter Has Been a Real Problem',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/arts/television/josh-thomas-cheer.html,"After hopping around his native Australia last fall with his first stand-up show in six years, the comedian Josh Thomas returned home to Los Angeles. Now he's taking his show on a U.S. tour through March 11, as well as preparing for a potential second season of ""Everything's Gonna Be Okay,"" his Freeform show, which debuted in January and is available on Hulu. Working on these projects meant not leaving his house for days at a time, as he read scripts and rewrote jokes, a process he describes as being like ""trying to put on a wet bathing suit"" Distraction was never far away, though: ""Cheer"" distracted him from an Oscar party the night of Feb. 9; RuPaul hosting ""Saturday Night Live"" distracted him from his work; and Twitter distracted him from everything (""Twitter has been a real problem to me,"" Thomas explained). Over the course of two housebound days, Thomas tracked his cultural diary. These are edited excerpts from a conversation.

On Sunday night I went to an Oscars party, not an interesting party. You know those nights where you're out, but you just want to get home to finish your show? Well, I had one of those nights with ""Cheer."" So I got home at about 1 a.m. and then I watched the final episode of ""Cheer,"" just alone, eating leftover curry. I was very drunk and I did cry -- when La'Darius's brother sheds a single tear? That was the end of me. Then when I woke up in the morning, hung over, I watched Seth Meyers's ""A Closer Look"" segment from his show the night before. At the moment I'm just addicted to American politics, so I'll watch pretty much all the late-night show monologues the next morning. I really love Seth Meyers, and his ""Closer Look"" is great because it gets me in deep a little bit. I like ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" because he's really funny and ""Full Frontal With Samantha Bee"" is probably my favorite, but she's only weekly. Then my producing partner Stephanie [Swedlove] called me, because I've got to read new writer scripts. Her ringtone is ""Work Bitch"" by Britney Spears, which always just makes me laugh. On Stephanie's phone I set it so that when I ring her, ""Beautiful Boy"" by John Lennon plays. I watched a lot of YouTube and then I washed my dog (we sit in the bath together) and I listened to Lizzo. All I really do is listen to Lizzo. And I read the scripts. I like reading new writers' scripts because you get to see what writers think new shows should be, before they get churned through the industry. And generally their scripts are not about rich people, but a lot of shows on TV, including mine, are about rich people, which I think is interesting.

And then I looked at Twitter. At the moment, I find it really hard to look away from what's happening in the world. I was off Twitter for four months last year but now I'm back in and it's just hell, actually. Because Twitter is always telling you what's wrong with everything and then someone else is like, ""Actually that is not the real thing that is wrong with that, the real thing that is wrong with that is this"" and it's suffocating. And then occasionally there's porn and occasionally something quite whimsical and funny. In many ways, it plays into my ADHD really well. My day was a real hodgepodge: I'll watch a little something and then I'll get mad at myself for not working and then I'll do some work for my stand-up tour and then I'll decide that it's very important to catch up on RuPaul Charles hosting ""Saturday Night Live."" I mean, if someone gay does someone, then I'll watch it. And I love RuPaul, obviously. So I worked more on my standup tour, and then I thought I should watch the Oscars movies. I'm not on the cutting edge of new entertainment. I'm not one of those people that's going out trying to find the hot new things. So I usually haven't seen anything until very late. I was going to watch ""Parasite,"" obviously, but I was watching on my laptop in my bed and I thought maybe that wasn't the best situation to watch ""Parasite"" in, so I decided to watch ""Judy"" because I thought it was going to be fun. It was fine. I'm single, you know, so I watch a lot in the evenings. From 6 p.m. to midnight I'm just watching so much TV. So after ""Judy"" I watched Conan, and then I watched a new episode of ""Curb Your Enthusiasm,"" which is a show that I really like, and then I watched ""McMillions,"" which is this new HBO thing about McDonald's. And then I went to bed, finally, around 1 a.m. The next day I did a lot more work. I watched Seth's new ""Closer Look"" again. Then I listened to this podcast I was supposed to be a guest on that it turns out I'm obsessed with, called ""Off Menu."" It's about your dream meal and it's really lovely.

And I listened to my Spotify playlist. I only want music that I've heard before, I don't want new music. So I've been playing this 24 song playlist on a loop since October. It's comforting. The theme of this playlist is songs that my ex-boyfriend used to play. There's no men, only female singers. One of my favorites is ""Let's Go to the Beach"" by this Australian band Banoffee. There's also some Des'ree and ""I Try"" by Macy Gray. Then finally I watched ""Parasite,"" and the subtitles stopped me looking at my phone for two hours, which was a real thrill. Subtitled movies are going to be my new thing, I think. I also watched the documentary ""American Factory,"" which is very much about the American working class. I watched the films while the [New Hampshire] primary was happening and so I was watching that via Twitter too. And I watched a bit of Elizabeth Warren's speech, and read everyone's opinions. This was interesting because both films have themes of class, which I feel like Americans don't really talk about much, but in this Democratic primary is really a big deal. So it was a lot of subtitles, and then a lot of ideas about our society and where it's going, which I really like. I don't watch a lot of scripted stuff; I like things that feel real. My scripted stuff is as realistic as possible and pretty issues-focused. I watched Julia Louis-Dreyfus on ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert."" If she's on TV I'll have a look, of course. And then I went to bed around 1 a.m. again.",The Australian comedian shares what he watched and listened to over a couple of days.,b7c0393b-0fe4-5248-a9cb-f10334ab3077,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/01/arts/01recently-viewed/01recently-viewed-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0650830f014d031f4f8fe4433b8053aa16707f905a8e9b6b2394d46991dcbd5e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Josh Thomas in bed with his laptop, which he decided was not the best screen on which to watch ""Parasite.""",b7c0393b-0fe4-5248-a9cb-f10334ab3077,N24News/imgs/b7c0393b-0fe4-5248-a9cb-f10334ab3077.jpg,3
Sports,"Online, Virtual Games Escape the New Reality",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/sports/esports-gaming-coronavirus.html,"NEWNAN, Ga. -- A few blocks from downtown, inside a building with a brick and stucco facade, two men were immersed in an e-sports event, one of the safer competitions remaining in a sporting world upended by the coronavirus pandemic. The men -- Tyler Mercer, 24, and Chris Caldwell, 23 -- call themselves Killer Instinct for online video gaming purposes, and they were at Newnan Esports on March 21 playing Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. Six teams were competing, though the other teams were playing from homes nearby. Hayden Marlowe, the owner of Newnan Esports, opened his business so Mercer and Caldwell, the reigning champions, would have access to the fast internet speeds that gaming demands. The two live in rural Pike County, Ga., where their bandwidth isn't as snappy as it is in Newnan, a town of nearly 40,000 about 40 miles southwest of Atlanta.

Though not mandated to, Marlowe closed his store on March 16 after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to limit gatherings to 10 or fewer people. Atlanta's stay at home order went into effect on March 24, and other cities in Georgia have followed suit. ""We don't want to be the reason why people get sick,"" Marlowe said. ""We want everyone to be healthy and heed government warnings when they're warranted."" He added: ""We also have the capability to not have to be here. E-sports has the ability to be played online, and you can organize through many apps that are available on the internet."" Though e-sports can be played from nearly anywhere in the world, Marlowe markets his company and tournaments to those living within a 50-mile radius of his store.

Three of the 10 gaming stations inside his establishment were being used on March 21, two by Caldwell and Mercer and one by Marlowe, 29, who was reporting the action as it streamed on Facebook. A few friends had also stopped by to watch.

Once the tournament started, at 6 p.m., the only sounds inside Newnan Esports, a former dance studio, were Marlowe's commentary and Killer Instinct's instructions to each other as they spotted enemies while navigating different Call of Duty maps. ""He's right above me,"" Caldwell said to Mercer before a quick fist bump as one skilled shot resulted in a kill. Marlowe opened Newnan Esports in February. This was the third tournament he hosted, though it was the first one that took place online. The others were played in-house, with about 30 players and fans packed into the building. While gamers are sometimes stereotyped as being antisocial, the social aspect of video gaming is actually alluring, he said. ""But since we're not supposed to be social right now, it kind of takes away from that a little bit,"" he said. ""But luckily the infrastructure is there to still maintain a sense of normalcy, you know, in still playing with local players.""

The pandemic was on the minds of Mercer and Caldwell, but their lives have largely been uninterrupted, they said. They still have their jobs at construction equipment companies. ""We're taking it seriously, but not panicking at the same time,"" Mercer said. ""Just try to stay out of people's way as much as possible and not go out and do as much as we were, but also not be at home not doing anything."" The pair won the tournament again, defeating Dementor Gaming, 3-2, in a tense final contest that lasted about 20 minutes.When the tournament was all over, after nearly three hours, Killer Instinct walked away with $80 to share. Marlowe said his take might be $20. ""It's not like I'm doing well with it,"" Marlowe said. ""It hurts that we're new, so we're trying to get our name out there. Every week we're doing something. It's a chance to reach someone new.""","With their ability to be played online, e-sports are one of the last bastions of competitive sports in a world upended by the coronavirus pandemic.",575f34fc-c840-5a49-b005-b921b21067de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/30/sports/00virus-esports1-print/merlin_170866380_eed78972-87c8-47e0-b876-abf3e4c5b4f8-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=940aa69d04b084375374639c3ed5f18703a3461977e4446ac9c1614d483195fc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tyler Mercer, left, and Chris Caldwell competed in an e-sports event on March 21 in Newnan, Ga.",575f34fc-c840-5a49-b005-b921b21067de,N24News/imgs/575f34fc-c840-5a49-b005-b921b21067de.jpg,9
Books,Groomed to Be President,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/books/review/jfk-fredrik-logevall.html,"Logevall painstakingly reconstructs Kennedy's several youthful trips abroad, where he sowed some wild oats, to be sure (there is plenty of that in these pages, more than enough fornicating and philandering to sate even the most prurient reader's taste), but more consequentially, made use of his father's abundant connections to interview statesmen and political leaders in Europe and beyond. Toward the end of a seven-month junket that ranged from Moscow to Jerusalem, the 22-year-old Kennedy, Zelig-like, was in Berlin in August 1939, accurately predicting the imminent outbreak of war, and shortly thereafter sitting in the visitors' gallery at Westminster to witness Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain proclaim Britain's belligerency. Everywhere he took notes and everywhere he grew in wisdom and conviction. ""It was the kind of exposure and training,"" Logevall writes, ""that no future president since John Quincy Adams had enjoyed at so young an age.""

A fastidiously diligent researcher, Logevall pays scrupulous attention to Jack's prep school and college essays, including a close reading of the Harvard senior paper that became Kennedy's first book, ""Why England Slept,"" which analyzed the timidity of Britain's political class in the face of indifferent or hostile public opinion. Logevall pronounces it a ""thoughtful and cogent ... original contribution to knowledge."" He later describes Kennedy's best-selling ""Profiles in Courage"" (whose actual authorship has long been contested) as an ""ode to the art of politics"" that, he valuably reminds us, ""extols both compromise and courage."" From all the carefully marshaled evidence a picture emerges of an uncommonly curious, sometimes frivolous but increasingly earnest young man on his way to shaping an informed, cleareyed, unsentimental sense of the world and his nation's place in it.

And its place in history. Kennedy's generation came of age in the mid-20th century's agonizingly long season of Great Depression and world war. The former touched the Kennedys lightly if at all. But the latter blighted the father's diplomatic career, claimed the life of the eldest son and made a hero out of the commander of PT-109. It also catalyzed Jack Kennedy's comprehension of what was at stake in the modern contest of nations, and deepened his skepticism about the utility of war itself, especially after the advent of nuclear weapons. It instructed him about the distinctive characteristics of his allotted historical moment, and left him convinced that the time had urgently arrived when America had to cast off its isolationist legacy and don the mantle of global leadership. In this he decidedly detached himself from the views to which his father so unremittingly clung.

This is the heart of this richly detailed and instructive book. And it is where Logevall's expertise as a Pulitzer Prize-winning scholar of international relations comes advantageously into play -- and where his book's subtitle, ""Coming of Age in the American Century,"" is brought tellingly into focus. To the biographer's insights he adds the historian's perspectives about the several episodes in which the young Kennedy's worldview took shape: his father's tortured tenure as ambassador in London while the Munich crisis unfolded and the debate over ""appeasement"" took on ugly intensity; the American commitment to sweeping international restructuring at war's end; the vexing role of domestic politics -- notably the red-baiting antics of Senator Joseph McCarthy -- in the nascent Cold War; and the postwar struggles over decolonization, not least in Indochina, where Congressman Kennedy in 1951 saw at first hand the futility of France's effort to crush Vietnam's determination to be independent.

Logevall artfully melds the biographical and historical approaches. Though crafted as a kind of bildungsroman, ""JFK"" delivers something more than the traditional story of the callow wastrel's maturation into the admirable adult. Here phylogeny closely replicates ontogeny. John F. Kennedy's individual journey of separation from his father's isolationism tracked the progression of the United States in midcentury from peripheral international player to hegemon. The global stage where a president could bend the arc of world history remained Kennedy's preferred arena and the presidency his obsession. The domestic issues that lay in a state governor's province he once dismissed as ""little more than 'deciding on sewer contracts.'"" This was the mind-set he brought to the White House, and in some ways this entire book can be read as an elaborate prolegomenon to Kennedy's most important foreign policy address, at American University in June 1963, where he urged a realistic reappraisal of the Cold War and laid the foundations for the hotly contested policy that became known as detente.","Fredrik Logevall's ""JFK"" brings the young Jack Kennedy to life with telling detail and knowing insights.",bddbf519-044e-5631-a9ec-85370773ec06,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/13/books/review/13Kennedy/20Kennedy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f5fe1eaf0dcb1697f856042bd8e16dc792fa66094b3e7fd8c2508891f9634d66&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John F.
