Television,Review: 'Killing Eve' Returns in Fighting Form,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/04/arts/television/review-killing-eve-season-2.html,"So many of TV's most prolific killers are stony-faced ciphers, immune to the fits and pleasures of human existence. Dexter's fraught blankness is the whole point of the character early on; Jack Bauer has never known a moment of relaxed joy. But Villanelle, the glam assassin at the center of ""Killing Eve,"" is nothing but reactions. She sighs and grins and flinches, she rips into fast food, she screams at children. It's freeing, really. Take Barry on ""Barry,"" for the most relevant comparison. Bill Hader's fantastic performance relies on the character keeping everything in, clenching his jaw until you can hear his teeth shift. Proximity to violence requires a divorced stoicism. Walter White becomes Heisenberg not just through meth-cooking but through rigidity. Everyone on ""The Walking Dead"" is in a scowling contest, and the prize for winning is more scowls. This emotionality is one among many reasons ""Killing Eve,"" which begins its second season Sunday on BBC America, feels so fresh. Jodie Comer gives Villanelle a liveliness that almost feels like a sport. ""Is it hard being bad?"" a child hostage asks her in Season 1. ""Not if you practice,"" she replies brightly. She must have practiced a lot. She is great at being bad.

And in most storytelling, that would be offset by a more grounded counterpart. Think of the florid sensuality of Hannibal Lecter versus the quiet gray of Will Graham on ""Hannibal."" But ""Killing Eve"" doesn't just have an expressive mouse, it has an expressive cat, too. Sandra Oh's Eve Polastri, a middle manager MI5 officer who becomes an expert assassin-tracker on this case, is just as reactive. When she panics, her eyebrows move into another time zone. When she's relieved, her shoulders drop like she's a discarded marionette. Season 2 picks up seconds after Season 1's finale, just after Eve and Villanelle have finally had their quiet moment together -- a moment that ended when Eve stabbed Villanelle right in the gut. (""Sometimes when you love someone, you will do crazy things,"" Villanelle explains.) Despite the serious wound, she escaped, and the season sets the two free again, free to chase and be chased for another eight episodes. Eve isn't sure what happened, and she's afraid she's a murderer. She tries to keep it together, tries to quiet this fear, and sits at an airport bar in a daze. A fellow traveler misunderstands the source of Eve's paralysis, and Oh's face moves from terror to comprehension to release. She starts giggling and then moves into full-on laughter, and not just the sad, exhausted laughter that happens when you hear a bad joke on a terrible day. It's humanizing laughter, baptizing her back into the world of the living. Everything that was good about Season 1 is still good in the first two episodes of Season 2, the only ones made available to critics. Emerald Fennell has taken over for Phoebe Waller-Bridge as showrunner and head writer, and luckily the dialogue hasn't lost any of its verve. Oh and Comer burn just as brightly, and we get even more of Fiona Shaw's Carolyn, Eve's secretive boss.

It's not all acerbic jokes and violent impalings, though, and that's where the trouble lurks. Any time a show winds its way into ""and there's a secret cabal!"" territory, things get a little iffy, as shows like ""Alias"" or ""Chuck"" or ""Scandal"" demonstrate. ""Killing Eve"" has ""The Twelve,"" a group we know almost nothing about, except that they dispatch assassins and have ties to various governments. Their presence loomed over Season 1, but now it seems likely they'll take front and center -- I'm girding myself for double-agent and triple-agent secret infiltration stories that are rarely as interesting as two characters just telling the truth and seeing where that takes them. The other hiccup comes in Episode 2, where a still-wounded (literally; she's still oozing from her stab wound) Villanelle somehow becomes the world's unluckiest grifter, even though we know she's an elite criminal. It's an invention of a problem, not a natural consequence or inevitable path, and it's the kind of plot point that frightens me -- partly thanks to one character's always creepy doll obsession but mostly because it's the kind of move a show makes when it doesn't know what to do with itself. ""Killing Eve"" is not other shows, and this isn't a death knell by any stretch. But Eve and Villanelle -- and also everyone alive, sorry -- are their most interesting when they're the most themselves. It's not the deception that's intriguing; it's the honesty.",Everything that was good in Season 1 of the addictive BBC America thriller is still good in Season 2.,9ffd0725-915a-5ae3-ab58-94eca9ab2c27,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/05/arts/04eve-print1/04eve-print1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ca6d9453faad68e38a299de4745b836f6d00dfb18a6cbdfae2a630a600b27b70&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jodie Comer as Villanelle, the assassin who is great at being bad, in Season 2 of ""Killing Eve.""",9ffd0725-915a-5ae3-ab58-94eca9ab2c27,N24News/imgs/9ffd0725-915a-5ae3-ab58-94eca9ab2c27.jpg,3
Health,"For Quick Coronavirus Testing, Israel Turns to a Clever Algorithm",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/health/fast-coronavirus-testing-israel.html,"BEERSHEBA, Israel -- A team of three Israeli scientists has pioneered a coronavirus testing procedure that they say is faster and more efficient than any now in use, testing samples in pools of as many as 48 people at once. The Israeli government plans to roll out the new method in 12 labs across the country by October, anticipating that another wave of coronavirus infections could coincide with influenza season with potentially calamitous results. ""We're doing everything we can in order to be ready,"" said Ronen Walfisch, an engineer at the defense ministry who oversaw a pilot project to test the method's efficacy. The method passed with flying colors, he said. Moran Szwarcwort Cohen, who runs the virology lab at Rambam Health Care Campus in Haifa, said the new pooled-testing method, which was formally approved for clinical use by the Israeli health ministry on Tuesday, could allow schools, college campuses, businesses and airlines to clear whole groups of people far faster than has been possible until now.

""It's a huge game-changer,"" said Dr. Cohen, who was not involved in the new research. Pooled testing for the coronavirus has received much attention in the United States as inundated labs struggle to cope with backlogs and shortages of chemicals, pipette tips and other supplies. Most pooling efforts elsewhere are relying on a simplistic approach developed to test World War II draftees for syphilis. That so-called Dorfman method, named for the economist who dreamed it up, calls for testing pools of samples from several people at once. If the pool tests negative, then all individuals are considered negative. If the pool tests positive, then additional samples from each individual must be retested to see which are positive. The Israeli method, by contrast, is designed to only require one round of testing -- a crucial savings in time, laboratory work flow and supplies.

In a study published on Friday in the journal Science Advances, Dr. Shental and his colleagues, Tomer Hertz and Angel Porgador of Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, report that their method -- called P-Best, for Pooling-Based Efficient SARS-CoV-2 Testing -- successfully detected positives in pools of as many as 48 samples. The method accurately screened 1,115 health care workers with just 144 tests, the study found. In one typical iteration, the Israeli team took samples of 384 people and divided them into 48 pools, so that each person's sample wound up in a unique set of six pools. Each of the 48 pools was then tested. If one person was positive for the virus, then each of the six pools containing that sample should test positive -- resulting in a unique combination of positive pools revealing the identity of the person (or people) carrying the virus. The algorithm optimizes the design of its pools according to the expected prevalence of the virus, making it possible to pinpoint all of the positive individuals in a batch, as long as the total number of positives does not sharply exceed the expected number.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. Like all types of pooled testing, the usefulness of this method drops as a community's ""positivity rate"" -- the proportion of tests that come back positive -- climbs.

Israeli officials and researchers are working with an artificial-intelligence company to help cull samples that are likely to be positive, based on known hot spots, to keep positivity rates lower, Dr. Hertz said. A frequent concern raised about pooled testing is that samples will be diluted, causing a loss of sensitivity that could result in false negatives. But Dr. Shental said the new method was effective even with low viral loads because each sample is tested in multiple pools. Israel is in the grip of a rough second wave of the pandemic, and many expect that it will only be brought under control by reimposing a nationwide lockdown. Because of delays in purchasing the sophisticated pipetting robots necessary to run the new method quickly, officials said they expect it will only kick in when that next lockdown is eased. The three scientists who devised the method have formed a company, Poold Diagnostics, and are looking to bring their algorithm to labs in the United States. Michael S. Lebowitz, chief science officer at 20/20 GeneSystems, in Rockville, Md., which has plunged into the Covid-19 testing market, said it was in talks with Poold to file a joint application to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization to try out its method. He said the method could be enormously useful in getting businesses or college athletic programs back up and running and ensuring that their populations remain healthy. ""The ideal situation is getting results in 24 to 48 hours,"" he said. ""If you can get compression of about eightfold, you're now running many fewer samples.""

But Dr. Shental's head was elsewhere: He had not worked with group testing in years, and was instead focused on research that got him on the cover of the journal Science in late May, in which he established associations between certain types of bacteria and certain kinds of tumors. ""I was dismissive of her at first,"" Dr. Shental said, smiling sheepishly. ""But when I was driving home, I realized it could work."" Dr. Shental called his best friend, Dr. Hertz -- the two got their Ph.D.'s together -- and within two days, Dr. Porgador, who has since been named Ben-Gurion University's dean of the health sciences, had set up an experiment using samples from Soroka Hospital across the street. A short time later, Ben-Gurion's president, Daniel Chamovitz, who had solicited suggestions for how to fight the pandemic with a promise to fund the best ones, found $150,000 to buy an advanced pipetting robot to try out their idea.","Inspired by a mother's question, the new method will be introduced across Israel this fall, just in time for flu season, and could be coming soon to the U.S.",5e20a691-7da8-54d7-bb78-b9c026fe0db6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/21/world/21israel-pooled-testing01/21israel-pooled-testing01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3686d945af4d92014608a308dd0e59cadfe1307ce1e168def3b97cb375fcfc09&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Israeli scientists successfully detected coronavirus positives  in pools of 16 and 48 samples with a new testing procedure.,5e20a691-7da8-54d7-bb78-b9c026fe0db6,N24News/imgs/5e20a691-7da8-54d7-bb78-b9c026fe0db6.jpg,1
Sports,Still Want to Watch Basketball? College Coaches Know Where to Look,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/20/sports/ncaabasketball/best-college-basketball-games.html,"Still Want to Watch Basketball? College Coaches Know Where to Look

Tom Izzo, Michigan State's men's basketball coach, heard from his 93-year-old mother not long ago. ""I don't know what to do with myself,"" Dorothy Izzo said, according to her son. Her usual plans for March -- watching college basketball -- had collapsed. The cancellations of the N.C.A.A.'s men's and women's basketball tournaments because of the coronavirus pandemic left millions of fans without the promise of hour after hour of live college basketball over the next several weeks. But a trove of games endures online, meaning a basketball fix is mere keystrokes away. This week, which was supposed to be the launch of both tournaments, we asked some of the most famous coaches in college basketball to tell us about their favorite March Madness games over the years. Many of them confessed to feeling lost without the tournaments, even as they said they understood the N.C.A.A.'s decisions. But it had been decades, Tom Izzo said, since he had spent this time of year doing something besides preparing for games, coaching in them or watching from afar.

What he'd watch: 2012 national championship game between Kansas and Kentucky. Why he'd watch it: Kentucky was far in front at halftime when Calipari heard his star freshman, Anthony Davis, make a startling announcement to his teammates. ""Look, I can't make a shot,"" Calipari remembered hearing from Davis, among the best players in the country that season, after he failed to hit a basket in the first half. ""I'm done shooting."" He'd play defense. He'd rebound. He wanted to do anything but take a shot. ""That moment kind of told me that wow, did we have something special,"" Calipari said. But it took some late heroics for Kentucky to win it all as Kansas clawed its way back into contention -- even on a night when Davis cobbled together 16 rebounds. With 1:11 to play and Kentucky up by 6, Calipari called a timeout.

""I had to slow down the game earlier than I usually did to make sure we were going to get a great shot every time down,"" he said. ""They were making a run at us, and we didn't want to give them momentum."" The Kentucky staff had a hunch about what Kansas would do coming out of the timeout: a backdoor that would have Tyshawn Taylor challenging Michael Kidd-Gilchrist. ""Michael, they're going run that backdoor to your side,"" Calipari remembered saying. ""Be aware. Be between your man and the basket."" Taylor broke free, driving to the basket. Kidd-Gilchrist blocked his shot on the weak side, and Kansas turned the ball over seconds later. The sequence all but finished off the Jayhawks' hopes. ""He came over and said: 'I'm sorry, coach. I'm sorry, coach,'"" Calipari said, recalling how Kidd-Gilchrist was upset with himself for allowing Taylor to get in position for a shot. ""I said: 'Are you crazy? You blocked it.'"" What he'd watch: Valparaiso vs. Mississippi in the 1998 tournament's first round. Why he'd watch it: Scott Drew was virtually certain he could see the future.

Valparaiso was bound for another inauspicious end at the N.C.A.A. tournament. Two seasons earlier, Arizona had crushed Valpo in the first round. The Crusaders had played Boston College a little closer in the next year's opening round but still lost. Sesay missed both free throws, but Valparaiso got possession after the ball went out of bounds. Just 2.5 seconds remained in regulation when Valpo inbounded the ball, which quickly made its way to Bryce Drew, Scott Drew's brother and a son of Homer Drew, the head coach. Just seconds earlier, Bryce Drew had missed a 3-pointer that would have put the Crusaders in front. This time, he planted his feet, just for a moment and well behind the 3-point line, and launched a jumper in front of Valpo's bench. It went in. ""It's the only time ever in my life I've jumped on the pile,"" Scott Drew said. ""You got lost in the moment.""

What he'd watch: 1992 Elite Eight game between Duke and Kentucky. Why he'd watch it: The last play was extraordinary: Duke trailed by a point with 2.1 seconds to go when Grant Hill inbounded the ball with a downcourt hurl to Christian Laettner. Laettner, who was standing near the free-throw line and faced with two defenders, leapt to catch the pass, faked, dribbled and then twisted leftward for the jumper. Swish. ""You think about the pass, you think about the presence of mind to know the look and be able to take your time and lock in on it,"" Grant said. ""It was obviously something they had worked on and were prepared for, and the ability to execute under those circumstances is pretty impressive.""

Michigan State had already downed Duke, a No. 1 seed in the tournament, and Izzo was left to coach against Tubby Smith, a friend. Michigan State led as the clock ticked down in regulation when Patrick Sparks, a guard for Kentucky, took one last shot: a 3-point attempt. The ball bounced around the rim and fell in as the buzzer sounded. Tie game. But cue a debate: Did Sparks have his toe on the 3-point line? A five-minute review commenced. ""That thing took as long and lasted as long because it was for so much: It was not only a controversial shot, but it was sending someone to the Final Four,"" Izzo said. The referees allowed the Kentucky shot to stand, sending the game to overtime, and then, eventually, another. Michigan State prevailed. How the Spartans won is a bit fuzzy in Izzo's mind. But he can still see the shot by Sparks.

""I don't remember any other plays in that game,"" he said, ""but I remember that one."" What she'd watch: Not a game but the HBO documentary, ""Women of Troy,"" featuring Cheryl Miller and the great Southern California women's teams that won N.C.A.A. women's titles in 1983 and 1984. Why she'd watch: The documentary captures the advent of women's N.C.A.A. women's basketball. The first men's N.C.A.A. tournament was held in 1939, but the association did not sponsor a tournament for women until 1982, a full decade after the passage of Title IX, the federal law that prohibited discrimination based on gender. Until then, the women's tournament had been facilitated by the Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women. Miller, from Riverside, Calif., was perhaps the first superstar in women's college basketball. This was an era long before the W.N.B.A., when CBS was obligated to put women's basketball on television so it could secure the rights to air men's basketball. But the women's game featured seminal players like Mulkey, Nancy Lieberman and Ann Meyers. At U.S.C., Miller, along with twin teammates Pam and Paula McGee, and Cynthia Cooper, played with verve and flair that, according to The Los Angeles Times, ""mirrored what the Showtime Lakers were doing across the city."" ""The more people can learn about the players who came before the players today, the better it is,"" said Mulkey, who also won national titles as a player for Louisiana Tech in 1981 and 1982. (The first was in the A.I.A.W. tournament, and the second came in the inaugural N.C.A.A. women's tournament.)

The game proved extraordinary. By the time Smith called a timeout with 32 seconds to play and Georgetown up by 1, the lead had changed 15 times and Williams's season-long belief -- that North Carolina had the best team in the country -- was in peril. The team seemed shaken, too. ""We kneel down in the front of them, and Coach Smith said: 'This is great. It's our ball, so we're going to determine who is going to win the national championship,'"" Williams said. ""When Coach Smith first started talking and saying we're in great shape -- I always believed everything the man said, but I sneaked a peek at the scoreboard because I thought we were down 1."" Smith ran through a few basketball items -- what they would run to inbound the ball, how he didn't think Georgetown would be pressing, the backup plan in case a lob failed -- and the session broke up. To Williams, the mood had improved. As Jordan headed back toward the court, Williams said, Smith offered him an admonition: ""If you get it, Michael, knock it in."" U.N.C. passed the ball around for 17 seconds as Patrick Ewing, Georgetown's center, hung around, ready to block. The ball reached Jordan, who launched into a jumper.",Some of the best coaches reflect on what they'll be revisiting with no N.C.A.A. tournaments happening.,b61cb36e-de11-5596-8c66-3c3792303085,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/20/sports/20ncaa-gamestowatch/20ncaa-gamestowatch-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a8f39c33fb4102fb2d070ea8f9312a571ec5240253cd5e749d2c6896cc103a0c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,North Carolina celebrates winning the N.C.A.A. men's basketball championship in 1982.,b61cb36e-de11-5596-8c66-3c3792303085,N24News/imgs/b61cb36e-de11-5596-8c66-3c3792303085.jpg,9

Books,"Dispute Arises Over 'No-No Boy,' a Classic of Asian-American Literature With a Complex History",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/06/books/no-no-boy-penguin.html,"""I worked harder at getting this book published than getting my own books published,"" said Shawn Wong, a University of Washington professor who helped resurrect ""No-No Boy"" in the 1970s.





Late last month, Penguin Classics released a new edition of John Okada's ""No-No Boy,"" a once-overlooked 1957 novel about a Japanese-American draft resister in World War II. It hailed the release as groundbreaking, noting that ""No-No Boy"" is ""the first ever Japanese-American novel and Okada is the first Japanese-American writer published in Penguin Classics."" The publication came as a surprise to Shawn Wong, an English professor at the University of Washington. In 1971, shortly after Okada's death, Wong and several friends found a copy of the novel in a used bookstore and later had it copyrighted and republished with the permission of Dorothy Okada, the author's widow. ""No-No Boy"" became an Asian-American literary classic and has sold more than 157,000 copies. ""It became a publishing success story,"" Wong said.

Now, Wong feels his efforts to rescue the book from obscurity, and the wishes of the Okada estate, are being ignored by Penguin. On Facebook, he posted an image of the copyright form he filed and called Penguin's decision to release a rival edition a ""moral outrage."" Penguin said that the novel is in the public domain and was never copyrighted in the United States, and that the copyright registration Wong filed covers only the introduction to the 1976 edition , not the underlying work. ""We acted in good faith to pursue 'No-No Boy' for publication,"" Penguin said in a statement. ""Our intent is to continue important conversations around 'No-No Boy' through its inclusion in the Penguin Classics series."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books?

The copyright question has overshadowed what should have been a moment of celebration for Okada's literary legacy. The novel's uncertain copyright status is further complicated by the fact that it was first published in Japan , by an English-language publisher, but the author is American. Some Asian-American organizations, as well as artists and writers, have thrown their support behind Wong. ""I am very disappointed in Penguin for appropriating John Okada's 'No-No Boy,' "" the novelist Viet Thanh Nguyen tweeted on Wednesday.

Densho, an organization that collects the testimonies of Japanese-Americans who were interned during World War II, also took aim at Penguin in a Facebook post: ""Extremely upsetting news regarding Penguin's 'new' edition of 'No-No Boy.'"" Dorothea Okada, John Okada's daughter, said her family was unaware of any issues with their claim to the copyright, and that the family wasn't contacted by Penguin before the new edition was published. The Okadas have been receiving royalties from the University of Washington Press for several decades, and it's unclear whether they will get any compensation from the Penguin edition. (Penguin declined to say whether the Okadas will receive royalties, saying the company would contact the family directly.) ""The university press has done a really good job guiding the book, so we were really happy with what they've been doing, and I don't think a bigger press would do anything for it,"" Dorothea Okada said. ""We would never change publishers.""

Wong added that the Penguin edition contains an error: John Okada's name appears at the end of the book's preface, incorrectly suggesting that the preface is a purely autobiographical author's note rather than a part of the novel itself , a mistake that appeared in an earlier University of Washington edition but was later removed. Karen Tei Yamashita, a novelist who wrote the introduction to the Penguin edition, said the earlier publication of the novel marked a critical turning point for Asian-American literature.

""You can't talk about that book without talking about what these guys did, and the impact that the book had on another generation of writers,"" she said. ""I feel disappointed that this should be a controversy at this time that should be more of a celebration of Okada's work."" Born in 1923 in Seattle, John Okada was a student at the University of Washington when he and his family were sent to an internment center in Minidoka, Idaho. Okada voluntarily enlisted, becoming a radio signal interceptor for reconnaissance missions over the Japanese coast and eventually serving among United States occupation forces in Japan. He later earned a master's degree from Teachers College at Columbia University. He and his wife settled in Detroit, where he found work as a librarian and worked on ""No-No Boy."" The novel centers on Ichiro Yamada, who is sent to an internment camp and then to prison after he refuses to be drafted into the United States military during World War II. According to Okada's biographer, Frank Abe, Okada based the character on a friend who was sent to prison for refusing the draft. The novel explores the experiences of Japanese-Americans accused of being traitors to America, and the divisions that occurred in communities and families when young Japanese-American men were asked to fight for a home country that had treated them as the enemy.

""No-No Boy"" was rejected by several American publishers before Okada sold it to a Japanese publisher for a $150 advance. The publisher, Charles Tuttle, printed 1,500 English-language hardcover copies in Japan, which were shipped to the United States. ""I've sat out the urge to turn cartwheels, to shout the news to the world and to dash off a letter of resignation to the library where I am employed,"" Okada wrote to the publisher, according to ""John Okada: The Life & Rediscovered Work of the Author of 'No-No Boy.'"" But when the book first came out in 1957, it wasn't a subject that American readers wanted to engage with, and it languished in obscurity. Okada went on to work in advertising. When he died in 1971 of a heart attack at the age of 47, the novel seemed like a failure.

After Okada's death, Wong and three of his friends, Jeffery Paul Chan, Frank Chin and Lawson Fusao Inada, rediscovered ""No-No Boy"" and made it their mission to republish it. For a second time, around half a dozen American publishers rejected the novel, so the group decided to raise the money to publish it themselves. They got word out through The Pacific Citizen, a Japanese-American newspaper, and offered readers a $2 discount if they preordered the book. Wong mailed the books himself, selling out of the first print run. The book, about a subject that was too painful for many Japanese-Americans when it was first published, resonated with a younger generation of readers. A few years later, in 1979, Wong and Dorothy Okada transferred publication rights to the University of Washington Press. It remains one of the press's best-selling titles. The rights manager for the press said it hired an intellectual property lawyer to look into the novel's copyright status, and the lawyer, Nancy Wolff, determined that in the United States, the novel is in the public domain. Other copyright experts say the case isn't so clear cut and that the Okada estate might have a basis for asserting continued ownership over the novel. ""This is really twisted, and reasonable minds could disagree,"" said Jordan Greenberger, an intellectual property lawyer. Wong said he hopes readers and educators continue to support the edition he helped to create, noting that it remains the only one with the approval and support of the Okada estate. ""I worked harder at getting this book published than getting my own books published,"" Wong said. ""The publishing history of the book is almost as important as the book itself.""

Movies,'Naples in Veils': A Morgue Doctor Is Obsessed. The Movie Is Lifeless.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/movies/naples-in-veils-review.html,"It's clear why filmmakers can't resist the allure of Alfred Hitchcock even if they inevitably fall short of him. But his imitators rarely come up with movies as pointless as ""Naples in Veils,"" which tips its hat vigorously toward the master's motifs -- the lost-and-found doubling of ""Vertigo,"" the repressed trauma of ""Marnie,"" possibly even Salvador Dali's eye design from ""Spellbound"" -- only to wind up as a tedious muddle.

Adriana (Giovanna Mezzogiorno), a pathologist in Naples who is shy with men, has a one-night stand with Andrea (Alessandro Borghi), a much younger diver. The sex is rendered with a level of detail that seems more suited to a Euro-art remake of ""Fifty Shades of Grey"" than a Hitchcock riff -- but then again, it's supposed to become an obsession for Adriana.

Economy,Trump Said to Pick Nominees for 2 Positions on Fed Board,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/business/economy/federal-reserve-board-nominees-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has selected candidates for at least two of the three open positions on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, according to people with direct knowledge of the decision. The expected nominees include Randal K. Quarles, a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, and Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who is now a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. In picking Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend, President Trump is seeking to install conservative counterweights to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Both men have expressed reservations about the Fed's aggressive efforts to revive economic growth since the 2008 crisis. Mr. Quarles would also become a leading figure in the administration's efforts to roll back financial regulation. He would be nominated to serve as the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, with responsibility for overseeing the Fed's regulatory responsibilities.

It is not clear when the administration intends to announce the nominations, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. Until that happens, it remains possible that Mr. Trump could decide to reopen the search process. Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend did not return calls requesting comment. ""We have no announcement at this time,"" said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman. Mr. Quarles, 59, is a managing director at the Cynosure Group, a private equity firm based in Salt Lake City. His wife's great-uncle is Marriner Eccles, the Fed's chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the Fed's marble headquarters on the National Mall in Washington, where Mr. Quarles would have an office. Mr. Quarles was a lawyer for the financial industry before joining the Bush administration in 2002, first as assistant secretary for international affairs and then as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving the administration in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group before helping to found Cynosure in 2014. At the Fed, Mr. Quarles would take the place of Daniel Tarullo, who led the Fed's push to tighten financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, though he was never formally nominated to serve as the vice chairman for supervision.

Mr. Quarles is regarded as significantly more sympathetic than Mr. Tarullo to the industry's concerns that regulation is overly restrictive, limiting economic growth. In a 2015 interview with Bloomberg Television, he said some postcrisis changes in regulation ""aren't well designed and were included for political rather than financial-regulatory reasons."" In a 2016 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Quarles argued that it was misguided to focus on the size of the largest banks. One of Mr. Quarles's major tasks at the Fed would be overseeing the annual ""stress test"" of large banks, intended to make sure that they can weather a crisis. But his influence would be constrained, at least in the short term, because Ms. Yellen played a key role in developing those regulations. Ms. Yellen's term ends in February 2018, creating the next Fed personnel decision confronting Mr. Trump. Mr. Goodfriend, 66, is a leading figure among conservative economists who study monetary policy. He worked for more than 20 years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; for more than half of that time, he was the chief monetary policy adviser to the bank's president, a member of the Fed's policy committee. He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend have expressed support for the idea that the Federal Reserve should adopt a more formulaic approach to policy-making. House Republicans have proposed legislation that would require the Fed to articulate a policy rule -- a mathematical approach to determining the level of interest rates -- that would limit the role of human judgment in monetary policy. ""If you're going to be transparent in an activity like the Fed, you have to be much more rule-based in what you're doing,"" Mr. Quarles told Bloomberg Television in 2015. He described the Fed's current approach as ""a crazy way to run a railroad.""

Mr. Goodfriend endorsed that approach in March testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He said adopting such a rule was necessary ""to improve the discipline"" of monetary policy and constrain inflation. Mr. Goodfriend is also a critic of the Fed's asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not purchase mortgage bonds, because doing so promotes economic growth in a particular sector -- the kind of judgment that should be left to those who determine fiscal policy. The Fed has operated in recent years without a full complement of seven governors. The board oversees regulatory policy, and the governors also hold permanent votes on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. By law, the Fed's board must include at least one person with community banking experience, and two of the people with direct knowledge of the process said that a number of candidates with that background have been interviewed in recent weeks. It is not clear, however, where a decision on filling the community-banking governor opening now stands.","Randal K. Quarles and Marvin Goodfriend, conservatives who could counter the influence of Janet Yellen, are expected to be two of the new governors.",3ede2364-acda-5124-8ae3-3e140d0e72e7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/02/us/02fed/02fed-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b1a191165cab28bb0a9b045732042d1b33ec04e94850d86cc199b5b138779e9f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Marriner S.

Theater,"Steve Carter, Playwright in a Black Theater World, Dies at 90",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/theater/steve-carter-dead.html,"Steve Carter, an award-winning playwright who explored the African-American and Caribbean-American experiences with incisiveness, humor and a willingness to wrestle with difficult themes, including hatred, revenge and forgiveness, died on Tuesday in Tomball, Texas. He was 90. A friend, Deb McGee, confirmed the death, in a nursing home. Mr. Carter had moved to the Houston area in 2011 to live closer to a nephew. Mr. Carter was one of many playwrights to emerge from the renowned Negro Ensemble Company in New York City in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. Several of his major plays had their premieres there. He was earlier associated with the Caribbean-born playwright, director and producer Maxwell Glanville and his American Community Theater in Harlem during the Black Arts movement, a flowering of politically motivated artistic achievement that began in the mid-1960s. At Mr. Glanville's theater, Mr. Carter said, he had ""a chance to do everything"": ""I was a set designer, a costume designer, a prop master.""

His arrival as a playwright was heralded in 1965 with a production of his one-act play ""Terraced Apartment,"" a satire about a lower-income Black couple who feel out of place after moving into a more upscale neighborhood in Harlem. (He revised it years later as part of a series of sketches titled ""Terraces,"" offering four views of life in a well-to-do terraced apartment building.) Two years later his surreal dark comedy ""One Last Look,"" centered on a funeral during which members of two Black families reflect on the death of their common patriarch, had its premiere at the Old Reliable Theater Tavern, an Off Off Broadway theater in the back room of a bar on Manhattan's Lower East Side. ""Mr. Carter succinctly and graphically provides more insight into black people than can be found in a library of sociological treatises,"" the critic John J. O'Connor wrote in his review in The Wall Street Journal. ""More should be heard from him.""

""I learned as much from the playwrights in the workshop as I think they learned from me,"" Mr. Carter said in an interview in 2016. His writing gained wider attention when the Negro Ensemble Company produced ""Terraces"" in 1974. Two years later it produced ""Eden,"" the first of Mr. Carter's trilogy of plays about Caribbean families living in New York City in the 20th century, which explored how a strict father disapproves of his Caribbean daughter's relationship with a rural Black Southerner. The second play in the trilogy, ""Nevis Mountain Dew,"" was produced by the company in 1978. It deals with euthanasia and its impact on the family of an incapacitated father who is confined to an iron lung. The inspiration for the disabled character, Jared Philibert, was Morton Lane, a Paramount Studios lawyer who was a quadriplegic, and whom Mr. Carter had taken care of years earlier as an orderly at New York Hospital (now NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital). Mr. Lane had encouraged Mr. Carter to pursue a writing career, and Mr. Carter dedicated ""Nevis Mountain Dew"" to him. In his Times review of that play, Mel Gussow wrote that Mr. Carter had written ""dialogue that is hearty, flavorful and lightened with West Indian rhythms and humor."" ""This is a serious play with moments that make us laugh out loud,"" Mr. Gussow added, ""and, it must be emphasized, this is laughter that rises directly from character."" Mr. Carter left the Negro Ensemble Company in 1981 to become the first playwright in residence at Victory Gardens Theater in Chicago. His first play to premiere there, in 1981, was ""Dame Lorraine,"" the final play of his Caribbean trilogy. It tells the story of a beleaguered family anxiously awaiting the return of the last surviving son, one of eight brothers, who has just been released from prison after 27 years.

Steve Carter was born Horace E. Carter Jr. on Nov. 7, 1929, in Manhattan. His father was born in New Orleans and grew up in Richmond, Va. His mother, Carmen Annetta Samuels, was from Trinidad. He had two brothers, both of whom died as infants, and a younger sister, June Bentham, who is his only immediate survivor. In an interview for the literary journal The New England Review in 2016, Mr. Carter traced his love of theater to the first Broadway production he saw, in 1938. The play was ""Amphitryon 38,"" Jean Giraudoux's retelling of a work by the ancient Roman playwright Plautus. The production starred Lynn Fontanne and Alfred Lunt. ""What fascinated me was the set design -- the stuff coming down from the flies and out of the wings,"" Mr. Carter said. ""I determined then that that was what I wanted to do. I was still under 10, and I started to make models of sets."" He wrote dialogue for the paper doll figures he created to act in these scale-model sets. Mr. Carter went on to attend the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan (now Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & the Arts).

He said it was a production of Tennessee Williams's ""The Glass Menagerie"" that inspired him, at 18, to be a playwright. He rushed home after the performance and wrote his first play, which he titled ""The Ballad of Hugo Jones."" After high school he served in the Air Force for four years and married while based in Europe. He said in interviews that while living there his wife and their two children, whom he did not identify, were killed in an automobile accident. It was, he said, one subject he would not talk about further. Mr. Carter took on work as an orderly at New York Hospital, where he had been born, after returning from military service in 1953. Continuing in the job until 1967, he would mine the experience in several plays. It was during his hospital employment that he volunteered to help out at the American Community Theater in Harlem. This proved to be the beginning of his theatrical career. Mr. Carter served for a time as playwright in residence at George Mason University in Virginia; his play ""Spiele '36, or the Fourth Medal,"" about an alliance between Black and Jewish athletes at the 1936 Olympics in Berlin, had its world premiere in 1991 on the university's campus, at the Theater of the First Amendment. His other plays include ""The Inaugural Tea,"" ""Mirage,"" ""Paradise,"" ""Primary Color,"" ""Root Causes"" and ""Walking Graffiti."" Many have been mounted on college campuses and in repertory theaters in the United States and Europe. Mr. Carter in an undated photo. He was the recipient of several awards and grants. Mr. Carter was a recipient of the Outer Critics Circle Award, the Drama Desk Award and the Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Award, as well as grants from the National Endowment for the Arts and the Rockefeller and Guggenheim foundations. In 2001, he received the Living Legend Award at the National Black Theater Festival in Winston-Salem, N.C.

Though Mr. Carter never achieved the wider fame of other playwrights associated with the Negro Ensemble Company, his imprint ran deep for many in the Black theater world. ""Without this playwright, I know my acting instrument would not be as sharp as it is,"" the actress and director Barbara Montgomery said in an interview for this obituary in 2017. ""His gift, his vision and his writing are main to my development as the creative artist I have become.""","He emerged from the Black Arts movement and the famed Negro Ensemble Company, writing dramas and satires about the Black and Caribbean-American experiences.",8d44c3a4-3a90-52e4-b9f0-69a90ea56a2c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/17/obituaries/17Carter1/17Carter1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=4efdaaa91bc5ce00eff9f16f0497ce33ff99e49e7e90731ef5d259a9f7b572d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The playwright Steve Carter with his mother, Carmen, near where he grew up in Manhattan in 1976.

Sports,"Harry Anderson, 'M.V.P. of American Sailing,' Is Dead at 98",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/sports/sailing/harry-anderson-dead.html,"Harry Anderson, off the coast of Newport, R.I., around 1980, ran two of the nation's oldest yacht clubs and was a major force in setting the rules of racing.





Harry Anderson, with ancestral ties to American wealth and power going back to Aaron Burr, learned to sail as a boy at Seawanhaka, a venerable yacht club on Long Island's North Shore, its gabled clubhouse rising from a green bluff on Centre Island overlooking Oyster Bay. Growing up in Manhattan, a scion of a long line of patrician lawyers (a great-grandfather was counsel to Cornelius Vanderbilt), he would spend summers at Seawanhaka immersing himself in the art and mechanics of sailing and in the gentleman's sport of sailboat racing. One summer, at 15, he joined a race to Bermuda with one of the Roosevelts. Another summer he crewed for a Vanderbilt. He eventually went off to Yale and, following the family tradition, graduated from law school at Columbia. But the law would prove not for him. He was continually drawn back to the sea. And that was where he would make his mark. By the time he died on May 11 at 98 in Mystic, Conn., Mr. Anderson had become one of the most influential figures in American sailboat racing in the last half-century, helping to develop the sport's modern rules and regulations, leading successful defenses of the America's Cup and creating a national governing body for sailing.

Buoyed by his inherited wealth, Mr. Anderson left the financial sector to become a ""full-time volunteer"" in sailboat racing, in the words of his biographer, Roger Vaughan, author of ""The Strenuous Life of Harry Anderson."" Mr. Anderson's roles were manifold. He was commodore of two of the country's oldest yacht clubs, Seawanhaka Corinthian (founded in 1871) and the New York Yacht Club (1844). He ran the North American Yacht Racing Union and served as a North American representative to the International Yacht Racing Union. And he groomed competitors for the U.S. Olympic team by contributing fleets of racing dinghies to collegiate sailing programs and nurturing Olympic-caliber sailors like Gary Jobson, the America's Cup winner in the 1970s. ""Harry recognized the value of promoting intercollegiate racing and recruiting the top sailors to compete in the Olympic trials,"" Mr. Jobson said in an interview. ""Many of America's sailing Olympians came out of the programs that he pioneered in the 1960s and 1970s.""

Henry Hill Anderson Jr. was born in Manhattan on June 2, 1921, the eldest of three boys of Henry Sr. and Helen Jennings (James) Anderson. His parents moved the family from a small Long Island estate in Roslyn to Oyster Bay when the boys were young. Henry Sr. was a partner in the family's New York law firm, Anderson, Howland and Murray. Clients included Harold S. Vanderbilt, a railroad executive, champion yachtsman and great-grandson of Cornelius Vanderbilt. Mr. Anderson's great-grandfather Henry B. Anderson, in addition to advising Cornelius, was counsel for the City of New York. Much of the family's wealth came from another great-grandfather, Oliver Burr Jennings, who was one of six initial stockholders in the Standard Oil Company, founded by John D. Rockefeller. (It was that branch of the family tree that reached back to Aaron Burr, the country's third vice president and the slayer, in a duel, of Alexander Hamilton.) Henry Jr., who was known as Harry, emulated his father's work ethic. ""Harry's card was to have an extraordinarily strict father,"" Mr. Vaughan, his biographer, said. ""One reacts to this accident of birth several ways. One is to rebel and run away. Or, when he says, 'Jump,' jump as high as you can. Harry said, 'I'll show him how darn high I can jump.'"" At Yale, Mr. Anderson sailed as a member of the university team, organized by the student-run Yale Corinthian Yacht Club in Branford, Conn., where his grandfather had been commodore. (Today, the team is considered one of the best collegiate programs in the country, and Mr. Anderson remained devoted to it, donating waterside property for its use in Branford.) His Yale class of 1943 graduated early, in December 1942, because of World War II, and he joined the Army, serving as a field artillery officer in Gen. George Patton's Third Army and receiving a Bronze Star.

Mr. Anderson was a Columbia law student when his father and Harold Vanderbilt enlisted him to help research and revise the rules of racing, which many yachtsmen then found vague and inconsistent. ""Harry's father and Harold Vanderbilt rewrote the racing rules of sailing in the 1940s,"" said the historian Mr. Rousmaniere, who credited Harry Anderson with refining many of those rules, including which sailboat gains right of way when they meet at turning marks in a race. Mr. Anderson went to become a respected race judge when he was still in his 20s, running the Yacht Racing Association of Long Island Sound. As executive director of the North American Yacht Racing Union, he orchestrated its split in 1975 into two governing bodies: the United States Yacht Racing Union and the Canadian Yachting Association. Before then, Canadian and American sailors were accredited for the Olympics by one organization. The split allowed for national autonomy for selecting Olympic teams. ""No one had thought about it,"" Mr. Anderson once said. ""It was way overdue.""","A scion of a patrician family familiar to yacht clubs, he devoted his life to racing and its rules, with a hand in the America's Cup, the Olympics and training the young.",073bfd01-6388-575a-b42c-8c14cb178d48,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/17/obituaries/Anderson-A/Anderson-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1b8614dcb01ab26432a809225be2f465b3b1836065c1ad34fb5e18cea475e78d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Harry Anderson, off the coast of Newport, R.I., around 1980, ran two of the nation&rsquo;s oldest yacht clubs and was a major force in setting the rules of racing.",073bfd01-6388-575a-b42c-8c14cb178d48,N24News/imgs/073bfd01-6388-575a-b42c-8c14cb178d48.jpg,9

Hala (Geraldine Viswanathan) is a 17-year-old Pakistani-American. She wears a hijab, she skateboards, and she prefers morning masturbation to morning prayers. This awkward Chicago teenager's story could easily have been shaped to fit a typical coming-of-age rebellion film: She has strict parents, has a crush on a boy they wouldn't like, and is sneaking around with him anyway. Instead of playing the scenario for laughs, though, the director Minhal Baig treats her character's hyphenated identity and her search for independence with quiet respect. Baig, who is Muslim and grew up in Chicago, drew upon her own senior year of high school for the film.

If you thought we were already at peak true crime, behold: a fictional series about making true crime media. Kathleen Barber's novel ""Are You Sleeping"" portrays a true-crime podcaster as a heartless vulture, but this adaptation is very much on the podcaster's side. (Sarah Koenig, of ""Serial"" fame, consulted on the show.) Octavia Spencer plays Poppy Parnell, a Bay Area journalist who doubts the evidence that convicted a teenager of murder some 20 years ago. She creates a ""Serial""-style podcast series, which asks the audience to reconsider the case, too (Spencer has Poppy's intimate podcast vocal delivery down pat). Her efforts to free the long-incarcerated Warren Cave (Aaron Paul) are not universally welcomed -- the police, the victim's relatives and even Poppy's own family all have objections, but Poppy plows on.

The serial killer Henry Lee Lucas has taught law enforcement a couple of embarrassing lessons. First, don't offer your perp strawberry milkshakes in exchange for each confession of murder. Second, don't give him case files to study and crime-scene clues to stir his ""memory.""

Lucas claimed to have randomly murdered more than 600 people around the country (an imaginary spree that was the basis for the 1986 movie ""Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer""). Police kept questioning him about thousands of cases, despite increasing indications that Lucas was making it all up. Authorities now believe Lucas's kills were actually in the single or double digits, meaning hundreds of murders to which he'd confessed were returned into the vast sea of unsolved homicides. In Noah Baumbach's new film, a divorce lawyer played by Alan Alda characterizes the sundering of marital bonds as ""a death without a body."" But the way it plays out here, between the actress Nicole (Scarlett Johansson) and her theater-director husband Charlie (Adam Driver), divorce is more like a love autopsy. The couple starts off wanting an amicable split, but once the expensive lawyers are involved, every stray comment or innocent mistake is scrutinized and weaponized, the story of their marriage rewritten with each cast as the villain to the other. Baumbach's unflinching examination of the imploding union spares neither party, and Johansson and Driver's commitment to their characters is devastating.

The standup comic Ronny Chieng has a lot on his mind, including politics, civil liberties, immigration, consumerism, subway etiquette and wedding planning. But Chieng is at his most incisive when he's blowing up stereotypes: Why do Asian-American immigrants want their first-generation children to become doctors, but then neglect to see doctors themselves? What if Asian-Americans became the impartial referees of all disputes among other races? (""No hatred, just solutions."") And what would it be like if an Asian-American were voted into the White House? This leads to a very funny rant, but Chieng doesn't really seem to be joking. Who knows what Joseph Aloisius Ratzinger, then Pope Benedict XVI (Anthony Hopkins), and Jorge Mario Bergoglio, the future Pope Francis (Jonathan Pryce), might have said to each other in private meetings six years ago? In this film, the writer Anthony McCarten and the director Fernando Meirelles imagine that the these two very different churchmen -- one a conservative traditionalist, the other considered a more liberal reformer -- had a momentous dialogue that led to the resignation of one man and the ascension of the other. Discussed are issues of sexual abuse and financial malfeasance, and nothing less than the future of the Roman Catholic Church appears to at stake. Even though the movie is pure speculation, the discussion is riveting, and the master actors Hopkins and Pryce create the illusion of actually having it. Rom-coms have long celebrated stalking -- think Lloyd Dobler and his boombox in ""Say Anything."" The dark conceit of the psychosexual thriller ""You"" is that the obsessive protagonist, Joe Goldberg, sees himself as a romantic hero, despite being a serial killer. Following his Season 1 murder spree, Joe now needs a change of scenery. So for Season 2 he relocates to Los Angeles -- a town he hates, providing much fodder for his biting voice-over. The plot this time is largely derived from Caroline Kepnes' novel ""Hidden Bodies,"" the sequel to her ""You."" An unfortunately named woman, Love (played by Victoria Pedretti from ""The Haunting of Hill House""), comes into Joe's orbit as the bodies start dropping again. Could it be that Joe has finally met his soul mate? Or has he just met his match? The ""Austin Powers"" series, ""Malcolm X"" and ""Searching for Sugar Man.""

It's time to hit the road, as Midge Maisel (Rachel Brosnahan) embarks on her first tour, opening for the musician Shy Baldwin on a circuit that takes her from Las Vegas to Florida. Along for the ride, of course, is Midge's manager, Susie Myerson (Alex Borstein), who gets a crash course on contract negotiations. Though a great opportunity for Midge, the tour presents a number of problems, so insecurities are high, nerves are frayed and bad options start to look rather tempting. (It's Vegas, after all.) The show's trademark rat-a-tat repartee only gets better with new banter partners joining the cast: Liza Weil (""Gilmore Girls""), Stephanie Hsu (""The Path"") and Cary Elwes (""Stranger Things"").

Eleven-year-old Jonas Brodsky is both precocious and deaf, and he wants to play Beethoven's Sonata No. 14, a piece the great composer wrote as he was losing his own hearing. In this documentary, Jonas's mom, the filmmaker Irene Taylor Brodsky, combines real footage and animation to tell her son's story, exploring the aural world of a gifted child with cochlear implants. Brodsky's deaf father, Paul, who invented TTY, the first telecommunications device for the deaf, wonders if advances in genetics and technology might mean that ""there will be no deafness in the future."" Brodsky herself suggests that Jonas' musical memory technique turns deafness from a disability into a gift.

The characters in this Tarantino-inflected neo-noir are a new breed of femmes fatales -- less seductive, but more, well, fatal. Although this highly stylized show (there are touches of Lynch and echoes of Hitchcock, too,) is nominally concerned with the activities of the men in the Banished Brawlers gang, the story really revs up when the gang's auxiliary women take charge. Worth extra-close attention is Abigail Spencer's Katherine Harlow, who always seems to be several steps ahead of everybody else. ""All my life, people have been underestimating me,"" she says. She's not complaining -- being underestimated proves to be her secret weapon.

Music,How a Pianist Salvaged His Lost Carnegie Hall Debut,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/25/arts/music/timo-andres-youtube.html,"It's a story that has become tragically common since the coronavirus pandemic brought live performances to a halt: The composer and pianist Timo Andres spent months preparing for his Carnegie Hall recital debut this spring. Then the concert was canceled. He had planned for the program to be a preview of the album ""I Still Play,"" out now on the Nonesuch label, with its brief pieces accompanied by several longer ones, including the world premiere of Gabriella Smith's restless and sparkling ""Imaginary Pancake."" Instead, he has been homebound in Brooklyn. He hasn't left a roughly two-mile radius of his apartment since March, though he has still kept busy, teaching at the New School, composing and spending a lot of time on YouTube.

""I know,"" Mr. Andres said in a recent interview. ""It's like, welcome to 2006."" But these days he is also very much on YouTube. Bucking the trend in classical music of often low-quality livestreams, yet not wanting to lay low completely, Mr. Andres decided to salvage his Carnegie program by documenting it as a series of videos on the platform. To pull off the project, Mr. Andres had to learn how to become a one-man filming operation, equipped with just a microphone, iPhone and editing software. The videos don't quite achieve the refinement of a studio recording, but they come impressively close.

What made you want to present your Carnegie program this way? I had a sense of things moving online, and I knew I wanted to do something with it. Friends suggested, ""You should do a livestream when the concert would have happened."" Mentally, I couldn't bring myself to practice the program for another month just for a livestream. Even if it's for more people online, it's just not the same. And I don't love listening to livestreams, to be honest. This was a way to keep myself occupied, to make these videos more slowly and sequentially. And to kind of have a sense of closure for the months of practicing that I had put in. It feels good to have a record of it that I can point to. Maybe I didn't have my Carnegie Hall debut or whatever, but I made this thing you can listen to for free at any time.

With the ""I Still Play"" pieces, what's the difference between playing them in the studio and on video? I often find that recordings, in the attempt to emulate the concert experience as ideally as possible, sometimes lose something in the way of risk-taking. And it's something that, especially as I start to record music that's not just my own music, I've been thinking about a lot, how to capture the spirit of that moment.

Onstage, I perform a mental trick where I imagine myself in my living room at my own piano. That's where I feel that I play the best, when I'm here on my own with nothing to lose. What's interesting is that I couldn't quite put myself in that mind-set; simply the fact that I was making a record of it made it difficult. How does that consideration change for a premiere made on video, like the Gabriella Smith? Putting a piece out there for the first time, I need to make a good impression. But I know as a composer, one doesn't necessarily envision every version of the interpretation as you're writing; I need to learn how to interpret my own music when I play it. I did run the final video by her before publishing. I was in fairly constant touch with her. In ideal circumstances I would be able to play it for her in person and go over all that stuff. This obviously wasn't ideal, but she gave me a lot of leeway to interpret it.

It's one of the longer pieces on the program. How do those fit in? What they have in common is, they have a bigger canvas for bigger landscapes. There's a different emotional impact that you can get with a piece that's the length of Frederic Rzewski's ""Winnsboro Cotton Mill Blues."" Or Aaron Copland's Piano Sonata, which is a beautifully economical piece and a beautifully eloquent, and really tragic, statement in the end, going from that intense outburst in the middle of the third movement to the coda, where it is just receding and receding and receding in these sort of progressive elegies. There's something so deeply moving about that to me. It's simultaneously anger and resignation, and of course a particular Americanness. And I do have this sense that we're living through a weirdly slow-motion tragedy. Obviously worldwide, but in this country specifically because it's a failure of leadership and a failure of empathy on the grandest scale imaginable. My piece ""Old Ground"" deals with another historical American tragedy, and then there's the Rzewski. All this music is so topical. I certainly didn't plan it that way, but when we're thinking about people working in Amazon warehouses -- that's what it's about.

It doesn't look like live performances will be returning for a while. Would you make more videos? There is one thing I'm doing: an outdoor performance of Reich's ""Six Pianos"" in Union Square Park. That's still on in August, as far as we know. It seems like if anything should happen, it's that. But this model of presenting a recital program, I'm interested in it. I don't know if it's something I can make any money on, to put it bluntly. Maybe there are presenters who could take them on, and that could be a stopgap in the meantime. I've also heard presenters planning things like instead of one big recital, two or three one-hour programs with the audience spaced out, and three seatings like you would at a jazz club. It's sad. I saw those photos from -- where was it in Germany? Yeah. I mean, it looks like some new music concerts I've been to in my life [laughs]. But it's definitely depressing. You get a certain energy from a good audience, and it will be hard to replace that.","Once the coronavirus pandemic canceled concerts around the world, Timo Andres decided to reconstruct his recital as a series of YouTube videos.",15c2b0e2-8b3f-55d8-9042-021a56fb8c00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/26/arts/25timo-1/25timo-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f364c3204461bd775dd6e725383c723410fa005cb9bab5ae72acacc3d89e5279&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The composer and pianist Timo Andres, whose Carnegie Hall recital debut in April was canceled but captured in a different way online.",15c2b0e2-8b3f-55d8-9042-021a56fb8c00,N24News/imgs/15c2b0e2-8b3f-55d8-9042-021a56fb8c00.jpg,12
Fashion & Style,Harvard Law School's Class of 1979: The 'Love Section',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/fashion/weddings/harvard-law-schools-class-of-1979-the-love-section.html,"Members of the 1979 Harvard Law who were in 1L, Section 3, are part of that class referred to as ""the love section."" Six couples, shown in the montage above, who met in this section of 140 students are still married to this day.

But as a member of the Class of 1979 and as someone familiar with all things Harvard Law, Professor Lazarus also wanted to alert us to an even higher romantic bar set by 1L, Section 3: Six couples not only married from that section, but -- drum roll please -- they are all still married. ""I am happy to report that, 40 years later, all six couples are still intact,"" said Professor Lazarus, who refers to that section as ""the love section."" (Professor Lazarus was a student in Section 4 that year.)

It's important to note that in 1979 women made up only about a fifth of the 140 or so students from Harvard's 1L, Section 3 -- still, a significant increase from when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was one of nine women out of 500 in the Class of 1954. ""Being guys we were very conscious of who the 20 women were,"" said George Berman, who married Regina Roman, at the Harvard chapel in July 1980, a year after their graduation. Mr. Berman noticed Ms. Roman the first day of school, but it would be weeks before he actually spoke to her, and then months later until he asked her out. He admired her independence and determination, and that of her friends. ""They took on this task, and damn it, they had the same attitude as pioneer women who took wagons to Oregon,"" he said.

""You certainly have a lot in common,"" Ms. Roman said of their relationship. ""Harvard was a petri dish."" The couple raised two sons in the Boston suburbs, and five years ago, moved to downtown Boston. Ms. Roman offered a word of advice for lawyers marrying each other: ""Don't work together in the same firm."" Ms. Roman's classmates, Penny Pilzer and Dan Waters, married in their third year of law school, in 1978. ""I can't remember if I met Regina first or Dan,'' Ms. Pilzer said. ""We signed into a book of all new students. It was multivolume. Everybody signs just their signature in case you got famous."" Mr. Waters recalled signing the book right after her. ""We were one of the first classes to have a substantial percentage of women -- it was four to one,"" Ms. Pilzer recalled. ""Harvard already did the selecting we looked for. It was just an early example of assortative mating.""

The couple now live in Rockport, Mass. Ms. Pilzer, who stayed home with their two children for five years when they moved to London, returned to law when she was 50 after passing Britain's solicitor's exam. Mr. Waters had been the head of enforcement for the British financial services regulator. Their joint advice to other lawyer couples: ""Don't behave like lawyers. Remember you're not adversaries. Don't argue your point unless you have to. Legal training is not designed for all aspects of human relations."" Don Scherer recalled meeting Lee Hanson the first day of law school, and they married 10 years later, in 1986. They now have two daughters and a son and live in Orinda, Calif., in the San Francisco Bay Area. After school, they traveled around the world for three months, knowing that at the end they would have jobs 6,000 miles apart -- she in New York and he in Honolulu. Ms. Hanson was later transferred to Tokyo. ""Whenever she traveled back to the States, she stopped in Hawaii, maybe partly to see me,"" he said of their friendship at that time.

The relationship between Bob Sullwold and Jane Cosgriff Sullwold started off in a less than friendly way. In torts class, Ms. Sullwold was assigned to a seat in the row behind Mr. Sullwold. ""I spoke to my neighbors,"" she said. ""He turned around and said 'I want to hear the professor and not you.'"" The couple began dating in the spring, and after law school settled in San Francisco. They are both originally from the Midwest -- she from Fargo, N.D., and he from Toledo, Ohio. Mr. Sullwold wanted to stay in San Francisco. ""I made the case San Francisco wasn't the Wild West,'' he said.

The two became officially engaged the day after taking the bar. Today they live in Alameda, Calif. The most difficult part of their relationship was getting through the long hours at work, Ms. Sullwold said. It helps, though, that the two have remained on the same wavelength. ""When an issue comes up, an important issue, we're looking at it in the same way, but differing at the margins,"" he said. ""Should we give more to AIDS or the food bank. The underlying theory the same.""

Common interests and backgrounds brought together Dveera Segal and Bradley Bridge, who have three children. The pair crossed paths outside a small legal methods class a few days after school began. She had transferred to that class from a later section on Friday so she could observe the Sabbath in time. ""She commented on my T-shirt,'' he said. It simply said UAHC Camp Swig staff, which she knew stood for Union of American Hebrew Congregations. ""She recognized that I was Jewish and so was she. That was the entry point. I'd never throw that shirt away."" They were married Aug. 5, 1979 after taking the Illinois bar exam. ""Dveera's my best friend and always has been,'' Mr. Bridge said. His advice: ""Respect the person and their judgment.""","Six couples from one section in the 1979 Harvard Law class married, and they remain married today. They offer some advice for lawyer couples.",5cf61091-1ffa-59d5-aa20-2c910bed0554,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/10/fashion/weddings/10harvard/00harvard-facebookJumbo.png?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=6f03277d44e3bd702fec44d584071c409f58599f55d34e60c7c17c2720d48930&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Members of the 1979 Harvard Law who were in 1L, Section 3, are part of that class referred to as &ldquo;the love section.&rdquo; Six couples, shown in the montage above, who met in this section of 140 students are still married to this day.",5cf61091-1ffa-59d5-aa20-2c910bed0554,N24News/imgs/5cf61091-1ffa-59d5-aa20-2c910bed0554.jpg,19
Dance,Review: 'This Bridge' Is an Audacious New Dance Work,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/arts/dance/review-miguel-gutierrez-this-bridge.html,"""I would like to understand what is happening,"" Miguel Gutierrez said during his show at the Chocolate Factory Theater on Wednesday, looking comically lost and stressed out. He was speaking in rapid Spanish, with English translations projected on the walls beside him, as a baffled character in his own live, absurdist telenovela. At this particular moment, with dialogue flying among him and his fellow cast members, the audience might have wondered the same: What was happening?

One joy of ""This Bridge Called My Ass"" -- a dense, audacious and wickedly funny work that had its premiere as part of the American Realness festival -- is the way that question evades any simple, stable answer. Mr. Gutierrez has long been a master of keeping an environment in flux, while somehow holding it all together. ""This Bridge"" contains multitudes and unflinchingly bears their weight.

[Read about the making of ""This Bridge""]

Borrowing its title (in part) from the 1981 feminist anthology ""This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color,"" the work itself is as tangled as the questions propelling it. Collaborating with five stellar performers and the dramaturg Stephanie Acosta, all of Latin American heritage, Mr. Gutierrez set out to explore a perception pervasive in his artistic circles, one that links artists of color with identity politics and white artists with investigations of pure form (as if such a thing exists, as if whiteness were not an identity).

At first, ""This Bridge"" reads like a sendup of a so-called formalist dance. As audience members take their seats, the performers are already engaged in matter-of-fact tasks, dryly reciting trabalenguas (Spanish tongue twisters) and rearranging objects strewn across the space: ladders, stools, laptops, power strips, swaths of pastel and fluorescent fabric. Stuff for stuff's sake. Mr. Gutierrez fastidiously lays a pair of red mesh underwear next to a plastic fan. Evelyn Sanchez Narvaez bundles pink fabric draped from the rafters, as if drawing curtains.","In his dense and wickedly funny piece, Miguel Gutierrez keeps an environment in flux while somehow holding it all together.",069c95c4-6bc1-5c66-93f2-092a98b3bd0f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/11/arts/11gutierrez-review/11gutierrez-review-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=542df876beabc9d75afe31c90ac8613bc5a8a00cfed81a9e0f8cc12fb2e3c282&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alvaro Gonzalez and Miguel Gutierrez in Mr. Gutierrez's new work, at the Chocolate Factory as part of American Realness.",069c95c4-6bc1-5c66-93f2-092a98b3bd0f,N24News/imgs/069c95c4-6bc1-5c66-93f2-092a98b3bd0f.jpg,6
Sports,Are You Ready for Some (Wednesday) Football?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/01/sports/football/steelers-ravens-nfl-wednesday.html,"If the N.F.L. schedules a game for a Wednesday, it is a safe bet that something went wrong. From a presidential speech to Pennsylvania's restrictive blue laws to a velodrome flooded with mud, the league tends to move its contests to that day of the week only as a last resort. That is certainly the case for Wednesday's game between the Baltimore Ravens and the undefeated Pittsburgh Steelers, which was originally scheduled for a prime time spot on Thanksgiving. The game was later moved to Sunday afternoon because of a coronavirus outbreak among the Ravens, then pushed to Tuesday night when the outbreak spread to affect over 20 people and finally ended up on Wednesday. A look back at Wednesday games throughout N.F.L. history reveals the league may not play on the day very often, but Wednesdays have provided more than their fair share of indelible memories.

""It takes a bite out of humble pie,"" Coach Tom Coughlin said of the loss. The humbling continued as the Giants went 9-7 that season and missed the playoffs, though they did manage the somewhat unusual distinction of playing on four different days of the week that year. In addition to their 13 Sunday Games, the Giants played games on a Monday, a Wednesday and a Thursday.

1948: The One With the Helmets As part of a spread out start to the 1948 season, the Los Angeles Rams played the Detroit Lions on Sept. 22. It was the league's first Wednesday game since 1940, when it was a more common occurrence, and its last one until 2012. Far more significant than the day of the week was a uniform innovation that came courtesy of Los Angeles halfback Fred Gehrke. Thanks to Gehrke, who had been an art major in college, the Rams became the first N.F.L. team to play a regular season game with logos on their helmets.

Gehrke hated the plain brown leather helmets of the era, so he painted one blue and added the team's now-familiar yellow horns. The Rams' owner, Dan Reeves, liked the design and Gehrke spent the summer decorating 75 helmets for use in the 1948 season, collecting a $1 fee for each helmet he painted. Gehrke would eventually become general manager of the Denver Broncos, but he was well aware of where he made his mark. ""I spent the better part of my life in football, and I'll be best remembered for some work I did with a paintbrush, but that's OK,"" Gehrke told Sports Illustrated in 1994. ""I've been called the da Vinci of football helmets, and that's not all bad."" Despite being the N.F.L.'s first night game, a matchup between the Providence Steam Roller and the Chicago Cardinals did not warrant much of a mention in The New York Times in 1929. Helmet design is not the only football innovation to make its debut on a Wednesday, as the N.F.L. also played its first night game on a Wednesday, way back in 1929. In the early days of the league, the Providence Steam Roller played their home games at the Cycledrome, a bicycle racing stadium in Rhode Island. A game against the Chicago Cardinals was unplayable because of heavy rains, but in a chaotic financial environment brought about by the recent stock market crash, the team's players were unwilling to skip a week of pay. So the Steam Roller brass arranged a makeup game for Wednesday, Nov. 6, at Kinsley Park, a minor-league baseball stadium that had recently installed lights. The Providence Journal recorded a crowd of 6,000 for the game in which the ball was painted white, giving it ""the appearance of a large egg"" in hopes that players would see it better. The matchup, part of a stretch of four games in six days for Providence, resulted in a 16-0 loss for the Steam Roller, but it was a financial success.","After multiple delays, the Ravens and the Steelers appear set for the N.F.L.'s second Wednesday game since one in 1948.

Music,"On 'Smile,' Katy Perry Finds Purpose (and Pitfalls) in the Past",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/arts/music/katy-perry-smile-review.html,"Though the singles from Katy Perry's ""Smile"" have flopped, the album provides an excuse to revisit them -- most are better than they got credit for.



It is either auspicious, or unfortunate, that Katy Perry is releasing her sixth album, ""Smile,"" the same week that her titanically successful 2010 record ""Teenage Dream"" is celebrating its 10th birthday. On the one hand, the anniversary reminiscences have been especially rosy; who right now is not nostalgic for what their life sounded like 10 years (let alone 10 months) ago? But reflecting on the staggering commercial success of that eight-times-platinum record puts into stark focus just how far, in the last several years, Perry has strayed from the gravitational center of American pop music. ""Teenage Dream"" spawned a record-tying five No. 1 singles; the only other album to achieve such a mass-cultural feat was Michael Jackson's ""Bad."" By contrast, of the last five singles Perry, 35, has released -- all in the yearlong, spaghetti-against-the-wall lead-up to ""Smile"" -- none exceeded No. 40 on the Billboard chart. Three of them failed to crack the Hot 100 at all.

Most of Perry's biggest hits, and four of the five No. 1 songs on ""Teenage Dream,"" were collaborations with the star producers Max Martin and Dr. Luke, who, by the mid-aughts, had boiled pop hitmaking down to a science. (Or maybe an arithmetic: Martin has famously referred to songwriting as ""melodic math."") But science and math don't sell concert tickets or magazine covers, so the ebullient personality and quirky co-written lyrics Perry, a daughter of Pentecostal ministers gone saucily secular, brought to these songs was crucial. She was the fluttering heart inside the algorithm -- wacky, seductive and full of fallible humanity.

But hitmaking has become less predictable. In the age of TikTok virality and stan-army-uniting super-duets -- the era of ""Old Town Road"" and ""WAP"" -- the code that producers like Dr. Luke and Martin once cracked no longer guarantees entry. Working with Dr. Luke, too, has now become a professional liability in the wake of his bitter legal battle with his former artist Kesha. Earlier this summer, Perry released the cover art for ""Smile,"" which shows her frowning cartoonishly in a harlequin collar and clown nose. Certain corners of the internet reacted as though she had shown up to a funeral in Daisy Dukes and a bikini top. ""Smile?! In this economy?!"" Much like her bloated 2017 album ""Witness,"" which promised but could not quite deliver the fuzzily defined commodity she called ""purposeful pop,"" Perry was once again accused of being out of step with the times -- the Left Shark in pop culture's otherwise precisely choreographed Super Bowl Halftime Show. But, at least this time around, such kneejerk criticism was too harsh. ""Smile"" doesn't have much of an agenda beyond a general feeling of uplift, and it has a lightness that makes it a better and more nimble record than its predecessor. All I'm asking of a Katy Perry song is for it to make me feel marginally happier than I did three and a half minutes prior. There are a handful of songs on ""Smile"" that do the trick.

""Smile"" often feels like it is testing out a few different concepts as to what Perry's music might sound like in the future, once she's accepted that she is no longer chasing world-dominating hits. The sweet, twangy closer ""What Makes a Woman"" provides one possibility, while the appealing, guitar-driven beach pop of ""Tucked"" offers a more familiar one. At its low points, though, ""Smile"" still feels tethered to the cold, steely, semi-desperately radio-chasing aesthetic of ""Witness."" The try-hard anthem ""Not the End of the World"" shuffles through several different expensively cleared hooks (an interpolation of ""Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye,"" a years-late nod to Drake's ""What a Time to Be Alive""), but none of them click. There are also two (consecutive!) songs about the well-worn pop tableau of crying on the dance floor, and while one (""Teary Eyes"") is better than the other (""Cry About It Later""), zero would have also sufficed. ""Harleys in Hawaii"" and ""Champagne Problems"" fail to make being rich, famous and in love sound particularly relatable, or interesting. The most surprising strength of ""Smile,"" though, is the way it circles back to the earliest days of Perry's recording career. Years before she became Katy Perry, the 16-year-old Katy Hudson released an angsty but ecstatic Christian-rock record -- think mid-90s Alanis, had she been addressing her songs to Christ instead of Dave Coulier. While ""Smile"" lacks that alt-rock edge, its most deeply felt material has a familiar devotional quality about it. ""I am resilient, born to be brilliant,"" she sings with soulful conviction on ""Resilient,"" a reunion with her ""Firework"" producers Stargate. On the title track, she posits that ""rejection can be God's protection."" Most striking, though, is the Amy Grant-style gospel pop of the penultimate track, ""Only Love."" Atop openhearted keyboard chords, Perry, a new mother, extends an olive branch to her parents: ""If I had nothing to lose, I'd call my mother and tell her I'm sorry,"" she sings. ""I'd pour my heart and soul into a letter and send it to my dad."" Their version of faith may look different from hers, but Perry sounds like she has not given up searching for a force greater than herself. In these moments, however fleeting, she seems at last to have figured out what ""purposeful pop"" actually means to her.","The singer and songwriter is no longer at the gravitational center of American pop music. But on her sixth album, she tries to add brightness to a dark moment.",a1b3030c-45c8-5029-85be-70ec6cb41f78,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/29/arts/27album-katy1/27album-katy1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=c07a2fa224947a76e1f17851ce39d78d0a32bc69456562d8502225bbecbb8d91&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Though the singles from Katy Perry&rsquo;s &ldquo;Smile&rdquo; have flopped, the album provides an excuse to revisit them &mdash; most are better than they got credit for.",a1b3030c-45c8-5029-85be-70ec6cb41f78,N24News/imgs/a1b3030c-45c8-5029-85be-70ec6cb41f78.jpg,12
Travel,Walk Past Those Limp Salads: Real Food Is Now Available by Gate 6,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/travel/good-airport-food-tartine-rick-bayless.html,"Airport food has long conjured images of limp, overpriced Caesar salads and refrigerator-case turkey wraps. But as terminals across the country modernize, and the demand for local food grows, the number of destination-worthy airport outposts offering food you'll want to eat has been steadily growing. The most recent example opened in January. The Manufactory Food Hall at San Francisco International Airport now offers fast-casual representations of cuisine from four notable local chefs and bakers: Pim Techamuanvivit of Thai restaurant Kin Khao, Gabriela Camara of Cala, and Elisabeth Prueitt and Chad Robertson of Tartine Bakery. Instead of soggy french fries and overcooked burgers, travelers in the International Terminal can order sandwiches on Tartine bread, gluten-free Thai fried chicken boxes and curry soups, and Mexico City-style tacos. The hall also features freshly baked pastries, Tartine's coffee and a full bar. ""When we were first approached about this, my knee-jerk reaction was, 'Never!'"" said Ms. Prueitt, citing concerns about quality control. ""But I started thinking about who we could collaborate with, how we could effectively translate our food to this environment. That made it a much more interesting venture.""

Opening a restaurant anywhere is difficult. Opening in the airport is a whole new level of hard: Unfamiliar security systems and supply chains, concern over operational control and the fear of brand misrepresentation are just the immediate hurdles. But the potential for such exposure -- from a captive and hungry audience, no less -- along with a new willingness of airport food service operators to meet chefs' demands has made the prospect more appealing.

For Ms. Prueitt, the chance to work with other local chefs made the proposition realistic and exciting. All of the chefs operate out of Tartine's San Francisco commissary kitchen, butchering, slow-roasting and fermenting their goods before delivering them to the airport. Ms. Prueitt makes weekly visits to catch up with staff and personally taste everything. When Rick Bayless opened Tortas Frontera in Chicago's O'Hare International Airport in 2011, it meant giving up a good amount of control. The vast majority of airport restaurants domestically are run by third-party operators and staffed by their employees; the Manufactory is run by SSP, while Tortas Frontera's three O'Hare locations are under the purview HMSHost. For chefs, that means a different kind of oversight is required. ""We have two full-time employees in our organization that go to every one of the places in the airport, twice a week, and make sure that everything is up to our standards,"" says Mr. Bayless. ""That's how we're successful -- we commit the labor to it."" That commitment, and willingness to work with airport-specific challenges, is necessary. Employees require security badges to get to work. Deliveries follow a tight schedule; chefs can't decide, on a whim, that they'd like a certain product.

However, operators have become more agile to chef demands (Mr. Bayless, for example, wanted to use ingredients from his favorite purveyors), and have built up their own infrastructures as this demand and interest has grown. HMSHost established a partnership with the James Beard Foundation and has built out its own chef staff, said Stephanie Havard, executive vice president of restaurant development. ""We've been hiring people from streetside restaurants that are very connected to the culinary world,"" Ms. Havard says of their expansion. ""We now have an operations team of more than 30 chefs who have worked with everyone from Todd English to Bobby Flay. It's given us the ability to speak 'chef's speak,' and to really connect with these local chefs."" The new food destinations in San Francisco and Chicago are far from alone. A Denver favorite, Root Down, opened a location at Denver International Airport in 2013; an outpost of the Denver Central Market opened there last November. Minneapolis-Saint Paul has locations of Black Sheep Pizza, Salty Tart and Angel Food Bakery. Phoenix, along with Seattle-Tacoma and New Orleans, have terminal modernization projects underway, with new local food options planned. Portland International Airport, in addition to hosting locations of Blue Star Donuts, Kenny and Zuke's, and The Country Cat, also provides travelers a tasting room for a local distillery, Westward Whiskey, which sells tasting flights and cocktails alongside bottles for sale. ""It's been one of the most successful things we've ever done,"" says Thomas Mooney, the distillery's chief executive and co-owner. ""We have the opportunity to connect with more than 40,000 people in a really immersive way."" And some food-minded travelers will adjust their itineraries for the sake of visiting a certain restaurant. April Oed Hamilton, a food educator and writer based in Baton Rouge, La., says she flies into San Francisco, instead of the more convenient San Jose Airport, when visiting a sister who lives in Santa Cruz.

""Anything for that Tartine morning bun!"" she said. In fact, Mr. Bayless says that Tortas Frontera at O'Hare has more regular customers than his downtown restaurants. ""I swear, my tombstone is going to read, 'He Made Good Food at the Airport!'"" he said. ""People are just so happy to have good food when traveling."" We have a new 52 Places traveler!

Style,Alfonso Cuarón Keeps the Winning Streak Going for Mexican Directors,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/style/oscars-roma-cuaron-mexican-directors.html,"El Espace is a column dedicated to news and culture relevant to Latinx communities. Expect politics, arts, analysis, personal essays and more. ?Lo mejor? It'll be in Spanish and English, so you can forward it to your tia, your primo Lalo or anyone else (read: everyone).

When Alfonso Cuaron took home the Oscar for best director on Sunday, he continued an almost uninterrupted winning streak by Mexican directors. Guillermo del Toro, Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu and Cuaron, together known as ""The Three Amigos"" in Hollywood, have collected five director awards in the last six years, for ""Gravity,"" ""Birdman,"" ""The Revenant,"" ""The Shape of Water"" and now Cuaron's ""Roma,"" which also won best foreign film. (In 2016, Damien Chazelle won for directing ""La La Land."")

""Roma,"" based on Cuaron's upbringing in Mexico City, broke ground by centering on an indigenous Mexican domestic worker, Cleo, played by first-time actress Yalitza Aparicio. Since the film's release, Aparicio, who was the first woman of indigenous descent to be nominated in the best actress category, has been featured prominently in magazines and news outlets here and in Mexico. Her character has also ignited a national conversation in Mexico about racial and class discrimination, and fueled advocacy around workers' rights. Cuaron teamed up with local organizations to throw huge public viewings of the Oscars in Mexico City.

In a post-awards news conference, Cuaron said that of all the movies he's directed, ""Roma"" is the one he least expected to win. The film was shot in black and white, and the dialogue is in both Spanish and a native Mixteco language, and lacks the ""big speeches and big stars"" that Cuaron said make for ""Oscar bait."" ""Gravity,"" his 2013 film co-starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, was a more predictable Academy pick.","This week in El Espace: Chicano culture in Japan, stats on immigrant founders and more.",35509f79-5785-5b8c-ac53-4c3ccebf0e1d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/24/arts/28elespace/28elespace-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=52860b8d281d2ad17a4392bc5ca3d121b11631a860e68d116048dcce4aad4cb3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alfonso Cuarón won the awards for cinematography, foreign language film and directing at this year's Oscars.",35509f79-5785-5b8c-ac53-4c3ccebf0e1d,N24News/imgs/35509f79-5785-5b8c-ac53-4c3ccebf0e1d.jpg,15
Fashion & Style,A Tour of Nobu Matsuhisa's Home Sushi Bar,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/fashion/mens-style/nobu-matsuhisa-home-sushi-bar.html,"The bar setting includes a traditional Daruma doll. Mr. Matsuhisa cooks at home for a select group of diners -- his family. ""There's no house specialty,"" he said. ""They like anything I make."" Emily Berl for The New York Times

The home sushi bar he designed and had built next to his training gym and pool in the downstairs of his large house. The bar sits eight, and no one cooks but Mr. Matsuhisa. ""My sushi bar is more of playroom,"" he said. ""It is my laboratory.""

The wood block is carved with the Japanese word for ""continuation."" Or ""keep going,"" as Mr. Matsuhisa translated. ""I like to move forward even it's just millimeters a day."" Emily Berl for The New York Times

It would be a dream to eat at your private sushi bar. Who do you invite? So far with this house I don't invite anybody. Just my family. I cook for my family once or twice a year. Like for Christmas or New Year's. There's no house specialty. They like anything I make.

So no famous dinner guests have dropped by? Not at this home. I had a sushi bar at the house where I lived before this one, and Bob De Niro came to eat my sushi. A house is very important for me because I travel 10 months a year. I have to be alone. I need my privacy. I don't see anybody but my family. You've been cooking in sushi bars since your teen years. You can't escape work even at home. Most sushi bars in my restaurants have a sushi display case. Here, no display case. Just counters, a fridge, everything but the fish and rice. It doesn't feel like work. It's fun. It's my stage. I don't want to lose my stage. I also don't want to forget how to make the good sushi myself.

Travel,"36 Hours in Bend, Ore. (and Environs)",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/30/travel/what-to-do-in-bend-oregon.html,"Residents of Bend unite around the core conviction that they live in a beautiful place. But great beauty also inspires an undercurrent of concern that this mountain town's natural splendor will be imperiled if too many people show up and spoil the place. A popular local bumper sticker reads, ""Bend Sucks, Don't Move Here,"" and Visit Bend, the local tourism promotion board, has launched a campaign asking visitors to take ""The Bend Pledge,"" essentially warning them against rotten behavior with the lure of a free trip to -- where else? -- Bend. Once called Quelah, the Beautiful Valley, by Native Americans, central Oregon is home to the world's last Blockbuster video store and it's known for its proliferation of cannabis dispensaries and craft breweries. But drinking, smoking and renting videos aren't the key attractions here. With all the opportunities to hike, bike, kayak, fish and daydream in the unspoiled nature that surrounds Bend, the place is a natural for family fun. Start with this kid-tested, parent-approved weekend and you might end up joining the crowd that hopes everyone else keeps out.

There's no better family-friendly introduction to Bend and its environs on a warm day than to float the Deschutes River. Rent a river tube from Tumalo Creek Kayak & Canoe ($16), and take the Ride the River Shuttle ($3, unlimited rides, June 15 to Labor Day), or walk to Riverbend Park, where you'll float down to Drake Park and then take the shuttle back. Your lazy float will take you north through the Old Mill District, with its three towering smokestacks -- a legacy of the competing lumber mills that once operated here -- then through a narrow section of the river where you'll float by the backyards of some lovely homes before ending up at pretty Drake Park, named after Alexander Drake, a Midwestern businessman who built a cabin here in 1900. After you clean up, treat yourself to a delicious almond cronut ($3.50), a doughnut-croissant hybrid at Too Sweet Cakes, owned and operated by the 25-year-old pastry chef prodigy Shelbi Blok.

In 1905, the year the city was incorporated, Bend's first doctor, Urling Coe, wrote in a letter that the town had two saw mills, eight all-night saloons with gambling, seven phone lines and a ""lusty red-light district consisting of several shacks on the river bank,"" frequented by ""freighters, stockman, buckaroos, sheep herders, timber cruisers, gamblers and transients of all kinds."" The vibe these days is less raucous, but the walkable downtown's two main north/south streets, Bond and Wall, still host much of the action. Downtown is particularly lively after work on the first Friday of each month, as child-friendly local businesses like Leapin' Lizards Toy Company and Dudley's Bookshop Cafe stay open late and frequently offer free wine and snacks for the First Friday Art Walk. Sit on one of the picnic tables with a view of Mirror Pond and the snow-capped Three Sisters peaks at Crow's Feet Commons, a combination cafe, bar, bike and ski shop, and you'll feel like you've landed on Bend's front porch.

3) 7:30 p.m. Dinner, old school and new The venerable Pine Tavern, established by a pair of enterprising women during the Great Depression, is a Bend classic, with an expansive patio overlooking Mirror Pond, curtained booths and a giant Ponderosa pine tree growing through the dining room. The happy hour bar menu specials are a good value, and their delicious, warm sourdough scones with honey butter, served after 5 p.m, are a bargain at 75 cents each. Children can feast on mac-n-cheese, chicken strips or grilled cheese for only $5.95. If you want something a bit less old school, try Bos Taurus, an upscale steakhouse that features premium meats from around the world, or Zydeco Kitchen & Cocktails, a busy, stylish spot where you can feast on grilled redfish ($27) while sitting at a sidewalk table enjoying the parade of people strolling by. Dinner runs about $20 to $30 without drinks at Pine Tavern or Zydeco, and about $30 to $50 at Bos Taurus.

4) 9 p.m. Beer, with and without the kids With nearly two dozen breweries in town, almost anytime is beer o'clock. Companies like Wanderlust Tours and the Bend Tour Company operate tours if you want to make the rounds. The tattooed, dog-owning parent set loves Crux Fermentation Project, which has a fenced yard and is pure Bend magic around sunset. For a taste of Bend history to go with your cream stout, head to the family-friendly McMenamins Old St. Francis School, an atmospheric complex built on the grounds of a former Catholic school that includes a small hotel, a cinema, an on-site brewery and restaurant, four intimate bars (including the hidden and aptly named Broom Closet bar) and, if you come a few hours earlier, a Turkish-style soaking pool where anyone can soak for $5 amid the fountains and ornate tiles depicting scenes with St. Francis. (Non-hotel guests can soak until 8 p.m., minors allowed until 6 p.m.; bring your own towel.) Hidden behind the main restaurant across a courtyard is Okanes, McMenamins' most charming pub. Its namesake, Hugh O'Kane, was a 300-pound Irishman who traveled the world as a stowaway before founding Bend's first hotel and saloon in 1905. Sit outside by the firepits, but don't overlook the tiny pub's stained glass windows and old church doors.

Get to the Sparrow Bakery's original location off the Bend Parkway early, before a line forms for ocean rolls ($4.50), Bend's must-eat pastry. Made with hand-folded croissant dough and layered with sugar, vanilla and cardamom, it's dense, rich and sensationally good. Sparrow's treats are on sale at several other places in Bend, so if you'd rather enjoy your ocean roll with a view of the river, go to Looney Bean Coffee, and pair your roll with the Dirty Hippy, a chai tea latte with shots of espresso. If pastries aren't your thing, get a mouth-watering, organic, free-range breakfast burrito ($6) and a dragon fruit smoothie ($5 to $8) from a drive-through (Life & Time:Free Range Fast Food). Then work off your breakfast on a Zagster bike share bike ($1.50 per 30 minutes, adult size only), or rent bikes of all sizes, as well as child trailers and buggies at Wheel Fun Rentals. Take a spin along the (partially) paved Deschutes River Trail or through the Drake Park Historic District to see some lovely homes, including the G.P. Putnam House at 606 Northwest Congress, which was once home to George Palmer Putnam. A New Yorker, Putnam came to Bend in 1909 at 21, became publisher of the local newspaper and then mayor in 1912 when the incumbent fell out a window to his death. He later married Amelia Earhart. Bend is more Mother Nature than museums, but you can enjoy both at the superb High Desert Museum (adults $17; children 3 to 12 $10), a 135-acre, indoor/outdoor museum in a woodsy spot south of downtown. The museum showcases the cultural and natural history of the Oregon High Desert, with an emphasis on Native American history and folklore, and animals that cannot survive on their own in the wild. Children will love the (injured) birds of prey, the desert tortoises, who inch around their habitat about as rapidly as some locals drive, and Pitch, Rogue and Brook, three musky-smelling river otters who showboat around their habitat like they're auditioning to be reality TV stars.

The experts at Visit Bend can help you narrow the dizzying number of outdoor activities and tour options, based on your tastes and fitness level. In town, a two-mile, round-trip hike (or drive) up 480-foot Pilot Butte offers panoramic views of the arid, sagebrush-dotted High Desert country to the east and the snow-capped mountains to the west. Families with younger children can cycle the closed-to-traffic road through Shevlin Park, one of the city's prettiest green spaces. Farther afield, the trails at Dillon Falls and the North Fork trail at Tumalo Falls are photogenic, or you can cool off inside the Lava River Cave ($5), where it's always 38 degrees. And don't leave town without venturing out to Mount Bachelor, Bend's premier ski resort, where in midsummer you can take the chairlift up to the 7,775-foot elevation Pine Marten Lodge ($20 adults, $14 youth 6 to 12), and have dinner or bomb down the 13 miles of downhill mountain bike trails. Cap off your afternoon of fun by driving along the Cascade Lakes Scenic Byway to idyllic Lucky Lake, where an easy one-mile hike through the woods earns you the right to take a blissful dip away from the summer crowds. 8) 7:30 p.m. The bend in the river The hamlet that grew up around the Farewell Bend Ranch was named Farewell Bend, until it was shortened by scrooges at the post office to Bend. You can learn about the city's logging history by reading the interpretive signs along the Deschutes River Trail in Bend's lively Old Mill District, where you'll see the three smoke stacks that have dominated Bend's skyline since the 1920s. For dinner, order the two-choice plate with kalbi beef and volcano chicken ($16.25) at the friendly Hawaiian restaurant Big Island Kona Mix Plate, or have the super-indulgent wagyu beef burger ($16) at the nearby Boxwood Kitchen & Supper Club, which also has a children's menu with options like buttered pasta or cheeseburgers for $8. Bend is a long way from the Caribbean, but if you travel a mile west of the Old Mill District to Cuban Kitchen, you can play dominoes and tuck into down home Latin delights like thin cut palomilla steak or puerco asado ($12 and $13 with two sides; children's meals are $7), lovingly made by the Aguilar family.

Bonta means ""goodness"" in Italian, but the term undersells how outstanding the gelato is at this popular local business. They vat pasteurize their milk and cream in house, ensuring that flavors like their Oregon hazelnut and peanut butter Theo fudge are intensely creamy. Before calling it a night, save time for a bit of family roistering at Worthy Brewing Company, which has its own ""Hopservatory"" -- a research-grade telescope, manned by a ""sky guy,"" or teach your children how to play Tapper and Donkey Kong at the Vector Volcano Classic Arcade. Sisters is a charming ranch town north of Bend, originally called Three Sisters for the nearby peaks Faith, Hope and Charity, more prosaically known as North, Middle and South. The town is graced with Old West-style storefronts, a fun annual rodeo, and a hyper-abundance of outdoor activities in the vicinity. Start your day with a cup of what many consider central Oregon's best coffee at Sisters Coffee, a block off the town's touristy main drag, and across the street from Paulina Springs Books, arguably the region's best independent bookstore. Then walk through town to Sisters Bakery, which has scones, doughnuts and other treats, and is housed in a 1908 building that was the town's general store from 1925 to 1950. Try the superb marionberry or bacon-smoked cheddar scones ($4 and $4.50) or the double chocolate doughnuts ($1.25).","This small, woodsy city is the perfect base for family fun, with enough hiking, fishing, biking, doughnut-eating and parental beer-sipping to keep everybody happy.",9c55d2ed-de8d-5ff2-92ea-158ac0a53a03,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/30/travel/30-Hours-Bend1/merlin_155125245_2f75236c-26bd-440d-b9dd-a87b965d1255-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3a41e0159d21414a9a4d734922f05950d6f64001667bba0e19a623c6b43ed5cc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Camp Sherman is a community of about 200 souls, deep in the woods along the Metolius River, a fly fisherman's dream.",9c55d2ed-de8d-5ff2-92ea-158ac0a53a03,N24News/imgs/9c55d2ed-de8d-5ff2-92ea-158ac0a53a03.jpg,4
Theater,"Mark Ruffalo, the Actor's Activist, Is Back on Broadway in 'The Price'",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/theater/mark-ruffalo-broadway-the-price-arthur-miller.html,"Recently, the actor Mark Ruffalo sent ""a prayer out into the universe"" for a kind of experience he wanted in 2017. ""All I wanted to do was get on a stage with a group of people I trust and love and do a great play,"" Mr. Ruffalo, 49, said over breakfast in Manhattan recently. ""No bells and whistles. No giant concepts. No reinventions."" The universe did as it was bade to do. The very next day, Mr. Ruffalo was offered the leading part in Arthur Miller's ""The Price,"" after John Turturro dropped out.

That his wish was answered by Arthur Miller seems particularly heaven-sent: In the almost 11 years since he last appeared on Broadway, in a revival of Clifford Odets's ""Awake and Sing!,"" Mr. Ruffalo has crammed an enormous amount of social activism into his busy career, which has garnered him three Oscar nominations (most recently for ""Spotlight,"" from 2015) and his family life (he and his wife, Sunrise, have three children, aged 15, 11 and 9). So the playwright's examinations of economic and class struggles resonate beyond the script for Mr. Ruffalo.

""Art is activism. My [acting] teacher used to say: 'We should pay to go to church, and the theater should be free. That's where we learn about ourselves,'"" Mr. Ruffalo said. In 2011, he stepped to the front of the movement against drilling for natural gas in upstate New York; recently, he helped deliver solar panels to the people of the Standing Rock Indian Reservation who were protesting the pipeline; and he helped organize and address a rally in New York City the night before the inauguration of President Trump (""We got 27,000 people within four hours!""). ""A lot of the anti-fracking movement was giving a platform to people who were living with the horror of fracking in their communities. Why aren't we hearing from the people? When you start to know your neighbor at a human level, it's hard to want to hurt them, even if you don't agree with them. It's hard to say, 'That person's water should be contaminated because I need to heat my house.'"" ""The Price,"" which opens March 16 and features Tony Shalhoub, Jessica Hecht and Danny DeVito (in his own Broadway debut), explores familial obligation and money in 1968 New York City. Mr. Ruffalo plays Victor Franz, a career cop who has been exiled to the police department's version of Siberia -- out by the airports -- because he doesn't participate in departmental politics and might rat out his colleagues who are on the take. When the play begins, he is in an abandoned old apartment cluttered with the vestiges of an elegant upper-middle-class family -- beds imported from Europe, Biedermeier-style tables, and a large harp, draped against the dust. We learn shortly that it is Victor's family home, and he is here to sell the contents before the building is demolished to make way for something new and modern. Complicating the transaction is Victor's brother, Walter Franz (Mr. Shalhoub), a wealthy doctor from whom he has been estranged for 16 years. And Esther, Victor's wife (Ms. Hecht), is self-conscious about appearances; she considers her husband's uniform is too much of a tell-all about their social status. It is full of questions of honesty and corruption, class struggle and expectations, even access to a decent education.

""It's about capitalism at its most tenacious, heartless and dehumanizing worst,"" Mr. Ruffalo said. ""It's a dialectic. We all have to choose between our humanity and survival, and it gives us a lot of hard choices to make."" Terry Kinney, who is directing the show for the Roundabout Theater Company, explained that Miller wrote ""The Price"" ""as a reaction to the avant-garde theater"" of the time, ""where characters didn't have a past; they were prototypes. But everything already happened before the play started. The characters are debating the past, and it has all of the catharsis of families."" ""The play talks about not being honest about the past,"" Mr. Ruffalo said. ""But it's just like now: Who is telling the truth? Which version do you believe?"" Mr. Kinney admitted that though Mr. Turturro was originally cast in the role, ""Mark Ruffalo was always on my mind, believe me."" He added: ""He's younger -- the exact same age as Victor. Mark's heart is so huge, but I wanted him to not be so transparent; Mark is deeply vulnerable. Victor stuffs so much inside.""

""I was dyslexic, so I wasn't good at school,"" he added. ""Higher education wasn't really an option."" After he graduated from high school, the family moved from Virginia to San Diego, and Mr. Ruffalo discovered acting through the Stella Adler school in Los Angeles. He formed a theater company with friends, working at menial jobs to keep him aloft. ""I was living hand-to-mouth but doing plays for $5,000 a pop; we did 30 plays in 14 years, and it was vibrant,"" Mr. Ruffalo said. ""I produced, acted, did fliers, costumes, lighting board, built our sets and really ran a theater."" He added: ""I was so poor I would buy a burrito and cut it in half to eat it for lunch and dinner. We were all struggling together, but those were magical days.""

But the joy of working in the theater felt indulgent to his siblings, by this time all working as hairdressers. ""I'll never forget it,"" Mr. Ruffalo said. ""My brother said to me: 'You're 27 years old, I'm sick of bailing you out; you got to grow up.' He was my younger brother. He told me to get a real job."" It was their mother who encouraged Mr. Ruffalo to not give up. The activism that consumes much of Mr. Ruffalo's time comes from a deep place. He says it began during the second gulf war. He campaigned for John Kerry, a senator at the time, when he ran for president in 2004, and he marched for peace in Los Angeles in 2008. He connects the peace movement with preserving the environment and helped organize the People's Climate March in New York in 2014. ""It took a year of really hard organizing to get 100,000 people there."" (It's estimated that there were more than 300,000 people total at the march.) He reads constantly, and prioritizes ""by what I'm seeing happening. I don't like to put myself in the middle of things when I'm not wanted or needed. If it's reaching people without me, I'd rather not get involved."" His support of Senator Bernie Sanders's president campaign was a natural fit, given the overlap in their progressive interests.

""I was fascinated by the idea of running a campaign outside the regular campaign finance system we had,"" Mr. Ruffalo said. He made a short film about the senator, ""Bernie From Brooklyn,"" in which he interviewed Mr. Sanders about his upbringing and his values. And for the issues that move him the most, like contaminated water in Flint, Mich., or the building of the Dakota Pipeline on land belonging to the Sioux tribe, he takes a diligent approach: He meets with scientists and reads their studies, speaking with great passion about renewable energy, something he has discussed with Prof. Mark Jacobson of Stanford. (They are both on the board of directors of the Solutions Project, which aims to move the country to clean power by 2030.) ""I see these historical moments, and I sense the historical significance of them,"" he said. ""I can't explain how I do that, but it feels game-changing."" Speaking of the North Dakota community at Standing Rock, he said, ""This is an important moment, and these people need a boost, and we bring a spotlight that draws eyes and attention."" Mr. Ruffalo's career is rich in independent movies and giant features in which he plays nuanced and often sensitive men. But a lot of this work is enabled through more commercial roles like the superhero the Hulk, to which he must return. ""I have to go back to work in April,"" he said, making it clear that what pays the bills feels like something entirely different from ""The Price."" ""We're doing 'Avengers' 3 and 4."" Mr. Ruffalo says the hardest thing about his job are the absences from his family. ""I have a rule: I can't be away for more than two weeks at a time,"" he explained. ""In two weeks' time, [the kids have] changed. It's heartbreaking to come back and realize you've missed it, and it's not coming back. A balance is hard to maintain."" When Mr. Ruffalo tells his children he has to leave, ""they always ask, 'Are you going to do environmental stuff or a movie?' If I say environmental stuff, they say 'O.K.' I'd rather be at home than at a rally. But if you're a caring human being, you have to do it.""","After an 11-year absence, garnering Oscar nods and leading protests, Mr. Ruffalo returns to Broadway in Arthur Miller's least-produced play.",9d75f1e1-edf5-5bf5-843e-8b1e21e98b8a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/05/arts/05RUFFALOJP1/05RUFFALOJP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7f4a417bfe8f324a14c673beb8860d92105bcf6f468468c1b8def4253465917a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mark Ruffalo at the American Airlines Theater.,9d75f1e1-edf5-5bf5-843e-8b1e21e98b8a,N24News/imgs/9d75f1e1-edf5-5bf5-843e-8b1e21e98b8a.jpg,10
Health,"Blaming China for Pandemic, Trump Says U.S. Will Leave the W.H.O.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/health/virus-who.html,"Blaming China for Pandemic, Trump Says U.S. Will Leave the W.H.O.

After spending weeks accusing the World Health Organization of helping the Chinese government cover up the early days of the coronavirus epidemic in China, President Trump said on Friday that the United States would terminate its relationship with the agency. ""The world is now suffering as a result of the malfeasance of the Chinese government,"" Mr. Trump said in a speech in the Rose Garden. ""Countless lives have been taken, and profound economic hardship has been inflicted all around the globe."" In his 10-minute address, Mr. Trump took no responsibility for the deaths of 100,000 Americans from the virus, instead saying China had ""instigated a global pandemic."" There is no evidence that the W.H.O. or the government in Beijing hid the extent of the epidemic in China, and public health experts generally view Mr. Trump's charges as a way to deflect attention from his administration's own bungled attempts to respond to the virus's spread in the United States.

A spokeswoman for the W.H.O. in Geneva, where word of Mr. Trump's announcement first landed at 9 p.m., said the agency would not have a response until Saturday. In April, when he was asked about Mr. Trump's accusation that the W.H.O. was ""China-centric,"" Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the organization's director-general said: ""It is wrong to be any 'country-centric.' I am sure we are not China-centric. The truth is, if we are going to be blamed, it is right to blame us for being U.S.-centric."" Public health experts in the United States reacted to Mr. Trump's announcement with alarm. ""We helped create the W.H.O.,"" said Dr. Thomas Frieden, the former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which has worked with the organization since its creation in 1948. ""We're part of it -- it is part of the world,"" Dr. Frieden said. ""Turning our back on the W.H.O. makes us and the world less safe.""

It is not clear whether the president can simply withdraw the United States from the World Health Organization without Congressional approval. ""The president can't unilaterally withdraw us,"" said Lawrence O. Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National & Global Health Law at The Georgetown University Law Center. ""It's a nonstarter,"" he added. ""This is literally a whim of one man, without any consultation with Congress, in the middle of the greatest health emergency of our lifetime."" The reaction among Democrats in Congress was swift and negative. Representative Ami Bera, Democrat of California and the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Asia, the Pacific, and Nonproliferation, called Mr. Trump's announcement ""shameful and irresponsible."" The W.H.O. ""is not a perfect organization,"" he said on Twitter, ""but leaving will make the United States and the world less safe. President Trump is ceding American global leadership and handing it over on a golden platter to China."" Representative Nita Lowey, Democrat of New York and the chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee, said: ""The president wants to blame everyone else -- the W.H.O., Twitter, the media -- when his own shortcomings as a leader are contributing to harm and further dividing us here at home and among global partners.""

The administration's response to the emergency has been fumbling and inadequate, many public health experts say, especially when compared to China's. The coronavirus has been the leading cause of death in the United States since mid-April, killing roughly 100,000 citizens to date. By comparison, only 4,600 Chinese citizens have died of the infection. About 20,000 Americans are infected each day, while China virtually ended its outbreak by April. On most days China records zero to five new infections, usually in travelers from abroad. The W.H.O. was founded in 1948 as part of the postwar creation of the United Nations and is the world's premier global health organization. Mr. Trump supported and generously funded the organization as it fought an Ebola outbreak in Africa for three years, but abruptly turned on the W.H.O. a few weeks ago, when he began accusing the organization of doing too little to warn the world of the spread of the coronavirus. In fact, the agency issued its first alarm on Jan. 4, just five days after the local health department of Wuhan -- at the time a city few non-Chinese had even heard of -- announced a cluster of 27 cases of an unusual pneumonia at a local seafood market. The W.H.O. followed up with a detailed report the next day. On Jan. 20 and 21, a W.H.O. field team visited China and reported that there could be human-to-human transmission of the new pneumonia-causing virus. Almost simultaneously, China's leading epidemiologist, who had just completed his own investigation on behalf of the Beijing government, confirmed during a Jan. 20 interview on state television that transmission to doctors was occurring in Wuhan, although he said on a recent interview with CNN that local officials had lied about it and even tried to mislead him.

Within three days, Beijing had shut off all travel out of Wuhan. Mr. Trump did not order any restrictions on travel from China until Jan. 31. The United States has been by far the W.H.O.'s largest donor since its inception. The budget for the W.H.O. is about $6 billion, which comes from member countries around the world. In 2019, the last year for which figures were available, the United States contributed about $553 million. A tense era in U.S.-China ties. The two powers are profoundly at odds as they jockey for influence beyond their own shores, compete in technology and maneuver for military advantages. Here's what to know about the main fronts in U.S.-China relations: Pacific dominance. As China has built up its military presence, the U.S. has sought to widen its alliances in the region. A major potential flash point is Taiwan, the democratic island that the Communist Party regards as Chinese territory. Should the U.S. intervene there, it could reshape the regional order. Trade. The trade war started by the Trump administration is technically on pause. But the Biden administration has continued to protest China's economic policies and impose tariffs on Chinese goods, signaling no thaw in trade relations. Technology. Internet giants have mostly been shut out of China, but plenty of U.S. tech companies still do big business there, raising cybersecurity concerns in Washington. Mr. Xi has said China needs to achieve technological ""self-reliance."" Human rights. Under Mr. Xi, China's confrontations with the U.S. over values and freedoms have become more frequent, including standoffs over Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong and mass detentions of Muslims in Xinjiang. World leadership. China's leaders see signs of American decline everywhere and they want a bigger voice in global leadership, seeking a greater role in Western-dominated institutions and courting allies that share their frustration with the West. The American government and private donors, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies and Rotary International, have wielded enormous influence on W.H.O. policies. For example, although the war on smallpox that was begun in the 1960s was at first largely a Soviet initiative, the W.H.O. chose American doctors, including Dr. William Foege and Dr. Donald A. Henderson, to lead the global campaign. The agency also chose American-made vaccines over Soviet ones for the war on polio. For many years, the American government, working on behalf of the Western pharmaceutical industry, pressured the W.H.O. not to publicly fight for lower drug prices that might threaten the patent monopolies of American companies. That changed in the early 2000s, when many American companies began sub-licensing their patents and technology to generics makers in India and elsewhere. No American has ever been director-general of the W.H.O., but that is because of a decades-old understanding that the World Bank and the United Nations Children's Fund would always be run by Americans, while the leadership of some other U.N. agencies, including the W.H.O., would be taken in turn by other nations.

The C.D.C. and many other branches of the American government have worked with the W.H.O. for decades. Along with the C.D.C., doctors from the American military and even the Army's 82nd Airborne Division worked in cooperation with the W.H.O. to fight the 2014 West African Ebola epidemic -- partly in an effort to keep it from reaching the United States. The W.H.O. provides essential diplomatic cover when American government agencies work in foreign countries. All countries that belong to the U.N. are also de facto members of the ruling body of the W.H.O. Asked for comment Friday, a C.D.C. official said the agency did not know what impact the announcement would have on its 72-year-old working relationship with the W.H.O., and referred all further questions to the White House. As he began facing harsh questions about his handling of the disease here, Mr. Trump swiftly diverted the blame to the W.H.O., threatening in a letter earlier this month to pull funding if it did not ""commit to major substantive improvements in the next 30 days."" In fact, under Dr. Tedros, the agency has been in the middle of major reforms for several years, focusing more of its attention on pandemics and less on the causes championed by wealthy donors, including tobacco, lung cancer and obesity. Last month at the World Health Assembly -- the annual meeting of the health ministers of all U.N. member nations that serves as the agency's governing board -- other member states rebuffed Mr. Trump's demands. They voted instead to conduct an ""impartial, independent"" examination of the W.H.O.'s pandemic response.",America's decades-long relationship with the organization has been instrumental in improving health around the world.,dd60b1a1-0a7c-578e-ba13-e44e0e86a699,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/29/science/29VIRUS-WHO1/29VIRUS-WHO1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6780973cdd7ab87d32c448f7db165e8cc302f17d4bf6b384880694ccf9d49acf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump made the announcement Friday in the Rose Garden.,dd60b1a1-0a7c-578e-ba13-e44e0e86a699,N24News/imgs/dd60b1a1-0a7c-578e-ba13-e44e0e86a699.jpg,1
Economy,24 Small Towns May Lose Air Service,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/19/business/economy/24-small-towns-may-lose-airline-service.html,"Rural America, already struggling to recover from the recession and the flight of its young people, is about to take another blow: the loss of its airline service. That was underscored last week when Delta Air Lines announced that it ""can no longer afford"" to continue service at 24 small airports. The carrier says it is losing a total of $14 million a year on flights from places like Thief River Falls, a city of 8,600 in northwest Minnesota that fills only 12 percent of the seats, or Pierre, the capital of South Dakota, where Delta's two daily flights are on average less than half full. Nationally, all major airlines have been reducing and sometimes eliminating flights altogether in small cities, as the industry concentrates much of its service in 29 major hubs, which now account for 70 percent of all passenger traffic, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Delta's announcement was especially acute because the airline operates in most of the small airports that receive a total of almost $200 million in federal subsidies to maintain air service under the Essential Air Service program. The subsidies are scheduled to expire in 2013 unless revived by Congress. Delta acquired many of those small-city markets in the Midwest when it merged with Northwest Airlines.

Airlines say that simple economics are driving them out of small-town America. With fuel prices high, carriers have been reducing domestic routes and seating capacity to focus on the flights that bring in the most revenue per plane -- typically those in larger cities, especially major hubs. At the same time, airlines are removing less fuel-efficient aircraft from their fleets, including the 50-seat regional jets that have been the backbone of air service in small- and midsize markets. ""We just don't have airplanes that can serve small communities economically anymore,"" said Michael Boyd, the president of the air-service consulting firm Boyd Group International. ""And unless somebody wants to pay a whole lot of money to carry a few people out of the airport at Thief River Falls, it just ain't going to happen anymore for a lot of those places."" One of those places, it appears, is Muscle Shoals, a town of about 13,000 along the Tennessee River in northwest Alabama. About $1.7 million a year in federal subsidies maintains two Delta flights a day from Northwest Alabama Regional Airport in Muscle Shoals, one of the 24 airports Delta wants to stop serving unless it can receive larger subsidies. Those flights are operated under the Delta name on Saab A340 turboprops flown by Mesaba Airlines, a Delta subcontractor. Barry Auchly, of the Shoals Chamber of Commerce, said that the airport has enough market vitality to justify keeping commercial service. However, he said, passengers have fallen off since Delta decided this summer to redirect its two daily departures to Memphis, rather than to Delta's global hub in Atlanta where the flights went last year. Delta says its flights from the airport are an average of 35.7 percent full, which compares with the national average on Delta's domestic flights of 81.9 percent in June.

""Last year, the first year with the Atlanta service, we exceeded 8,500 passengers and were well on our way to 10,000,"" said Mr. Auchly. That growth proved, he said, that the local airport could eventually operate without federal air-service subsidies. He said Delta told him the destinations were switched because Memphis, though far less in demand, had more efficient turboprop service facilities than Atlanta. ""We want to be a self-sustaining airport,"" Mr. Auchly said. ""We think we have the demand; we just need to be able to depend on consistent service."" Delta would like to continue flying from some of the 24 airports it designated last Friday as ""underperforming"" -- but only if the federal subsidies were increased to cover the additional costs of serving them with regional jets. Meanwhile, Delta said it plans to abandon other airports where load factors were deemed too low, and assist those airports in finding replacement carriers. Replacing a 34-seat turboprop plane with a 50-seat regional jet would seem to be counterintuitive in markets where the problem is too few passengers. Kristin Baur, a Delta spokeswoman, acknowledged that 50-seat regional jets, besides having 16 more seats, also are less fuel-efficient. However, she said, regional jets are more popular with passengers, and can increase overall bookings in some markets where people will drive to more distant airports rather than fly a turboprop from the local airport. Officials at some of the 24 small airports slated to lose Delta service said the airline has not flatly told them when it is stopping the flights, though at subsidized airports Delta said it would withdraw when the current contracts expired.

In some markets, depending on load factors, Delta would like to either receive new Essential Air Service contracts or get more money for the ones it currently has. Slightly more than a third of the airports Delta identified on its list would be in that group, it said. Pierre, a scrappy city of 14,000 that sits smack in the rural center of South Dakota, got the news that it might lose Delta service just as weary residents were hauling away the last soggy sandbags as they recovered from major flooding of the Missouri River in May.

After years of receiving federal air-service subsidies, the airport now has four unsubsidized departures a day -- two by the Delta subcontractor Mesaba and two by the regional carrier Great Lakes Airlines. The city was recently so optimistic about its prospects that it began construction on a $12 million passenger terminal at Pierre Regional Airport. ""We're rural America,"" said Laurie Gill, the mayor. ""It's hard for me to understand a business decision to eliminate commercial air service based on the growth that we've seen here."" Delta flew 4,840 of the total 6,833 passengers who boarded flights at Pierre this year through June, and Delta's planes left with 47.4 percent of the seats filled on average. If Delta leaves and no other airline comes in, most travelers from the South Dakota capital would have to drive to the closest bigger airport in Rapid City, 140 miles away. Time-constrained corporate and government travelers dislike that idea, Ms. Gill said.",Delta Air Lines says half-full planes and the high cost of fuel are leading it to reduce service to rural America.,94a265ad-5046-5b08-b4ce-4260e8b7d1be,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/07/19/business/AIRPORT/AIRPORT-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=347&w=600&s=65d43628aec049851a1810db37d4a60463b3a124c02828e6e70bf086d8401865&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Delta Air Lines wants to cease its two flights a day serving Muscle Shoals, a town of 13,000 in Alabama.",94a265ad-5046-5b08-b4ce-4260e8b7d1be,N24News/imgs/94a265ad-5046-5b08-b4ce-4260e8b7d1be.jpg,8
Dance,A Proudly Unsentimental 'Nutcracker' at Paris Opera Ballet,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/19/arts/dance/a-proudly-unsentimental-nutcracker-at-paris-opera-ballet.html,"PARIS -- ""The Nutcracker"" isn't obligatory Christmas fare at the Paris Opera Ballet; it hasn't been performed here for five years. But this year, Rudolf Nureyev's production of the ballet is in full swing at the Opera Bastille, although neither the setting nor the ballet feel particularly festive. The Bastille theater is huge, cold and impersonal, Nureyev's ""Nutcracker"" exactly the same. There is almost nothing that isn't strange about this version, nominally based on the original 1892 ballet, choreographed by Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov to Tchaikovsky's glorious score for the Mariinsky Ballet. Although Nureyev offers us the traditional party scene, a fight between the Rat King and the Nutcracker, snowflakes and the various national dances that characterize the final act, his production departs from tradition (as well as logic and theatrical sense) in a number of ways. Clara, the ballet's child heroine, is danced by an adult (on Wednesday night Leonore Baulac) , as is her brother Fritz (Adrien Couvez). It is not the Nutcracker doll that is transformed into a prince, but Drosselmeyer (Germain Louvet), in Act 1 a vaguely menacing but strangely insignificant figure. There are snowflakes, but no Kingdom of the Sweets or Sugarplum Fairy. (Her variation is danced by Clara as part of the final grand pas de deux.) The Russian, Arabian, Chinese and ""Pastorale"" dances of the second act are performed in the living room setting of Act 1; the conceit is that the family and guests from the party now populate Clara's dream imagination. Those concepts might be fine if Nureyev had managed to infuse the production with any coherent theatrical logic. But that's not the case. The adult dancers look unconvincingly childlike. Drosselmeyer, whose gift of the Nutcracker doll sets the plot in motion, has neither mystery nor ambiguity; he is reduced to skulking about in an eye-patch and large cloak in Act 1, and loitering on the side of the stage like a minor Dickens character at the end of Act 2.

Without reading the program notes, it's virtually impossible to understand that Drosselmeyer is also the Prince, and I can't imagine that many people recognize Clara's family as the leaders of the national dances. (I didn't.) The waltz of the flowers has no flowers and little waltz. Instead we get a stiffly regimented corps de ballet in gold costumes and white wigs. Which brings us to the costumes and decor, by Nicholas Georgiadis. These are at first stultifyingly dull, with the gloomiest brown living room ever for the first act (the Christmas tree, a non-event in this version, pushed to the very back of the room) and the party guests in matchingly depressing dark shades. Later, Mr. Georgiadis goes all stiffly opulent in a final scene ballroom setting, complete with candelabra and chandeliers. Neither these settings nor the staging offers the slightest hint of the magical and fantastical; a quality essential to a successful ""Nutcracker."" And then there is the choreography. Although it is credited to Nureyev ""after"" (ballet parlance for based upon) Petipa and Ivanov, parts of this version and its general concept come from a 1934 Soviet production by Vassily Vainonen. But Nureyev wasn't inclined to leave well enough alone; he never neglects to provide three steps where one will do. The dancing is difficult and awkward-looking in the extreme; strange little beats and accents permeate variations, everything is composed for maximum difficulty; the dancers are frequently late in arriving in poses or on the music because it's so hard to stuff in all the steps.

Nureyev's instincts are also extraordinarily unmusical. In the mountingly climactic passage that Balanchine uses in his version for the magical growth of the Christmas tree, we get the mice tossing Clara's doll around for an endless time. For the music during which, in the traditional version, the little prince recounts the story of the battle to the Sugarplum Fairy, Nureyev has cloaked figures with enormous doll heads menace Clara for another prolonged and boring period. There are several moments in the ballet where the ensemble file on in silence and wait for the music to start. It's almost embarrassingly clumsy. Despite all of this, the Paris company looked better as an ensemble than they have for a while. The children of the Paris Opera Ballet School were engagingly immersed in their characters and dancing. The snowflake corps de ballet was alert and attentive, sometimes even dancing slightly ahead of the beat instead of in the slightly posed, correct manner that the company can exhibit. Ms. Baulac and Mr. Louvet could have used some of that musicality in the principal roles. They are both very young, both only promoted 10 days ago from the corps de ballet to the status of soloist (""sujet"" in the Paris Opera Ballet hierarchy) and are clearly major talents. Ms. Baulac is blond and sweet-faced, with a glorious sweeping line and buoyant jump; the dark-haired Mr. Louvet is a danseur noble type, tall and elegant with a lovely refinement to his dancing. They coped with the difficulties of the choreography with admirable finesse and offered a radiant final pas de deux, but neither are as interesting to watch as they might be. Both move with a bland evenness; there is little phrasing or a sense of differentiated dynamics that would bring life and intensity to their dancing. This lack of responsive musicality is a pity, given the technical level of the dancing in this company. The snowflake scene suggests it's an issue that Benjamin Millepied, the new director of dance at the Opera, is addressing.

Health,"Do Not Eat Romaine Lettuce, Health Officials Warn",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/20/health/romaine-ecoli-outbreak-cdc.html,"The warning came just as millions of Americans were preparing for the biggest food holiday of the year. People should not buy or eat romaine lettuce; restaurants should stop serving it; anyone who has it on hand should throw it out and clean the refrigerator immediately. The stern and sweeping advisory, issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Tuesday afternoon, two days before Thanksgiving, caught many people off guard. But the agency said it was acting out of an abundance of caution after 32 people in 11 states fell sick with a virulent form of E. coli, a bacteria blamed for a number of food-borne outbreaks in recent years. ""If you do not know if the lettuce is romaine or whether a salad mix contains romaine, do not eat it and throw it away,"" the C.D.C. statement said. ""Wash and sanitize drawers or shelves in refrigerators where romaine was stored."" Officials said such measures were necessary while they track down the source of the contamination, and at the moment all they could say was that investigators believe the tainted lettuce was grown or processed in Canada or the United States.

They said a nationwide warning covering an entire type of food was unusual though not unprecedented, noting there was a similar alert regarding tainted spinach in 2006. Peter Cassell, a spokesman for the Food and Drug Administration, said officials were in this case mindful of the approach of the Thanksgiving holiday. ""It's especially important given that these are large gatherings where dishes containing romaine lettuce are frequently served,"" he said. The E. coli outbreak was first identified on Oct. 8 and has led to the hospitalization of 13 people, including one person who developed kidney failure. So far no deaths have been reported. Roughly a third of the cases were reported in California; the others are concentrated in the northeast and in the Great Lakes region. Another 18 people have been sickened in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and Quebec. These cases are genetically unrelated to an E. coli outbreak linked to romaine earlier this year that killed five people and sickened 200, the officials said. Investigators later traced that bacteria to a tainted drainage canal near a lettuce farm in Arizona. However the strain of E. coli associated with the current outbreak (identified as Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli O157:H7) has been involved in other deadly outbreaks, including one in 1993 that killed four children and left nearly 200 other people seriously ill from eating contaminated hamburger meat at Jack in the Box restaurants.

This strain is especially dangerous, health officials said, and the toxins it gives off can damage the kidneys. In the current outbreak, half of those infected have been hospitalized, a rate that is much higher than in other E. coli outbreaks, said Matthew Wise, the C.D.C.'s deputy branch chief for outbreak response. Steve Feldberg was standing in his kitchen Tuesday in Montclair, N.J., preparing dinner and feeling stymied. He pored over the lettuce he bought over the weekend at the local farmer's market. ""I think it's romaine,"" he said hesitantly. ""But it's not classic romaine. So we're taking a picture and emailing it to the hydroponic farm to find out, before we eat it."" Health officials had some other worrying news for Thanksgiving week. The C.D.C. and the United States Department of Agriculture have been tracking a yearlong outbreak of Salmonella, which has been linked to a variety of raw turkey products, including ground turkey and some live turkeys (also some pet food). A spokesman for the U.S.D.A. urged consumers to prepare turkey by following precautions such as careful hand washing to avoid cross contamination, and cooking poultry thoroughly. Determining the exact cause of food-borne outbreaks has long stymied investigators, especially those that affect leafy greens. Contamination often originates with livestock that are raised or fed near produce farms. But it is not always clear how the pathogens travel to fields of vegetables. Scott Horsfall, chief executive officer at the California Leafy Greens Marketing Agreement, an industry group, said the E. coli outbreak of last spring prompted growers in Arizona and California to embrace ramped up cleaning of equipment and they agreed to triple the distance between cattle feed lots and lettuce farms. ""E. coli and other pathogens don't spontaneously appear in lettuce fields,"" he said. ""They have to come from someplace else."" But some public health experts said the frequency of food-borne illness outbreaks points to the need for bolder action by both the industry and federal government, especially when it comes to tracing contaminated produce. Sarah Sorscher, deputy director of regulatory affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer group, said the industry has resisted more robust measures like the mandatory electronic tracing of produce after it leaves the field.",The C.D.C. issued the sweeping pre-Thanksgiving alert after 32 people in 11 states were sickened with a virulent form of E. coli.

Media,"In Letter, Redstones Urge Viacom and CBS to Explore Merger",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/30/business/media/viacom-cbs-merger.html,"The ailing 93-year-old mogul Sumner M. Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, on Thursday made their intentions for the future of their $40 billion media empire crystal clear: They are calling for the reunification of CBS and Viacom in an all-stock deal that would leave the family in control of the combined company. The father-daughter duo outlined their plans for the proposed deal in a 251-word letter sent Thursday to the boards of CBS and Viacom, instructing the directors to consider combining the two media companies. While the Redstones encouraged ""full and fair deliberation and negotiation"" on the potential transaction, the subtext of the letter was that the family would determine the fate of the two companies and that it wanted those two companies to become one. The Redstones left the directors of CBS and Viacom with few other options besides continuing as independently controlled entities. In the letter, the Redstones stated that they would not ""accept or support"" any acquisition by a third party of either CBS or Viacom. They also said they would not support a deal that would ""result in National Amusements surrendering its controlling position in either company or not controlling the combined company."" The blunt and public nature of the letter was not only a signal of Shari Redstone's vision for the two companies but also a way to build momentum toward having them combined under the leadership of Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS. Mr. Moonves, 67, has expressed doubt about a corporate reunion, and winning him over is crucial to the plan to combine them.

Kannan Venkateshwar, an analyst with Barclays, said in a research note that the benefits of a deal were predicated on ""CBS management expanding its curation expertise to Viacom's platform and being successful at it."" ""In our view, it is unclear if Mr. Moonves would want to undertake such a turnaround project and spread his time across a bigger portfolio of assets when he is in a relatively strong position competitively with one major asset,"" Mr. Venkateshwar continued. He said the likely solution would be for the Redstones ""to allow complete strategic and operational freedom to Mr. Moonves across the portfolio."" The Redstone family controls about 80 percent of the voting stock in CBS and Viacom through National Amusements, the private theater chain company started by Mr. Redstone's father. National Amusements directors who hold board positions at the two companies -- Mr. Redstone, Ms. Redstone and David Andelman -- would not participate in board discussions related to the proposed deal or vote the transaction. The development on Thursday continues the intense drama over the future of the Redstone media empire that has played out during the last year. At one point, the caustic fight for control included legal battles in three states, all centering on the question of whether or not Mr. Redstone had the mental capacity to make decisions about his businesses.

After the abrupt dismissal of that suit in May, without any decision on Mr. Redstone's mental capacity, Ms. Redstone then turned her attentions to the battle for control of her father's $40 billion media empire.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. In quick order, the Redstones moved to reorder the board of National Amusements, then the board of Viacom, ultimately leading to the ouster of Philippe P. Dauman as chief executive of Viacom. Ms. Redstone had clashed with Mr. Dauman, her father's longtime confidant. Now, Ms. Redstone's attentions appear to be turned to the reunification of Viacom and CBS. In 1987, Mr. Redstone took control of Viacom through National Amusements in a hostile corporate takeover, then went on to acquire CBS in 2000 in a nearly $40 billion deal. Mr. Redstone then split the two companies apart in 2006 as questions were being asked about the future of both businesses. Since then, it has been a tale of two companies for CBS and Viacom as each tried to secure its place in an increasingly digital world. Today, CBS stands in a position of strength, with solid ratings at its TV network and experiments with new streaming ventures. In contrast, Viacom has struggled, with its cable networks like Comedy Central and MTV suffering ratings declines and its Paramount Pictures film studio delivering disappointment after disappointment at the box office. While CBS's stock price is up about 40 percent in the last year, Viacom's stock price has tumbled about 11 percent. In their letter Thursday, the Redstones stated that reuniting CBS and Viacom ""would allow the combined company to respond even more aggressively and effectively to the challenges of the changing entertainment and media landscape."" Yet several hurdles remain beyond Mr. Moonves's role, including whether the transaction would be structured to benefit all shareholders and not just the Redstone family. Mr. Redstone and Ms. Redstone stated in the letter that they thought the optimal structure for a potential CBS-Viacom deal would be an all-stock transaction, with the stockholders of each company receiving shares in the new company in the same class that they now own.","The media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone, are suggesting an all-stock transaction that would leave them firmly in control.",4787065d-1640-5639-a2c6-3ce7991b50b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/30/business/30VIACOM-2/30VIACOM-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b53e86539da86197f8e9c9579602ee3396482604397e075db1d00dd9bd92f4fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sumner Redstone with his daughter, Shari Redstone, in 2012.",4787065d-1640-5639-a2c6-3ce7991b50b0,N24News/imgs/4787065d-1640-5639-a2c6-3ce7991b50b0.jpg,16
Economy,"Fed Holds Interest Rates Steady but, Defying Trump, Signals Increases to Come",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve raised its already high marks for the state of the economy on Wednesday, refusing to bow to President Trump's recent push for the central bank to pause its march toward higher interest rates. Federal Open Market Committee officials voted unanimously at the end of their two-day meeting to keep interest rates unchanged, at a range of 1.75 to 2 percent. But the statement they issued keeps the Fed on track to raise rates next month and again in December, after two rate increases in the first half of the year. Its revised assessments of economic growth and the inflation rate could signal that those coming increases are even more likely than investors previously thought. The statement declared that the job market continues to strengthen and that ""economic activity has been rising at a strong rate."" That is a change from the June statement, when the Fed said economic growth was ""solid."" Officials also improved their assessment of consumer spending, saying that it has ""grown strongly."" The Fed statement did not convey any concern that Mr. Trump's trade policies could hamper growth, nor did it suggest worry about the sluggish pace of wage increases for most workers. The Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, fielded a barrage of questions from members of Congress on those topics in testimony last month.

In their statement on Wednesday, Fed officials said the overall inflation rate and the rate that excludes volatile food and energy prices both ""remain near 2 percent,"" which is the Fed's target level. In June, officials said those rates ""have moved close to 2 percent."" In keeping with previous statements, officials continued to signal they will raise rates again soon, saying they expect ""that further gradual increases in the target range for the federal funds rate will be consistent with sustained expansion of economic activity, strong labor market conditions and inflation near the committee's symmetric 2 percent objective over the medium term."" The slight changes reflect improving economic data in recent weeks. Economic growth clocked in above a 4 percent rate for the second quarter, and inflation ran slightly above 2 percent. The statement did not come with an updated set of economic forecasts issued after the meeting or a question-and-answer session with Mr. Powell, who gives quarterly news conferences now but has chosen to pick up the pace next year and brief reporters after every Fed meeting. So there was no direct response to Mr. Trump, who has broken recent protocol and publicly criticized the Fed's path of rate increases, worrying that they will dampen a strong economic run. Here are four takeaways from Wednesday's Fed statement: The economy is running hot, but inflation fears remain contained. Mr. Powell has consistently played down the notion that the economy is close to ""overheating"" -- growing so fast, with unemployment so low, that it sets off a rapid escalation in wages and consumer prices. The economy's 4.1 percent growth rate in the second quarter certainly is rapid, but its current pace for the year, about 3 percent, is only slightly above the Fed's most recent forecasts. The statement acknowledged that acceleration but expressed no concern over it.

""Risks to the economic outlook appear roughly balanced,"" officials wrote, meaning that the likelihood is about the same that things could get better or worse in the economy. It's standard language of late for the Fed, and in keeping with analysts' expectations. ""We expect only minor changes to the policy statement to reflect the latest developments in the economy,"" economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch wrote in a research note on Tuesday. As Mr. Powell noted in his testimony before Congress last month, the Fed has heard a lot anecdotally from businesses about fears of Mr. Trump's tariffs and threats hurting investment and growth -- but those fears have not shown up in the economic data. That's partly because a pre-tariff surge in soybean exports helped prop up growth in the second quarter, a trend that economists warn will reverse in the back half of the year. ""The escalating trade rhetoric hampers forecasters' near-term view of the economy, which is a particular problem for the Fed currently as it attempts to engineer a soft landing from the current expansion,"" Deutsche Bank researchers wrote this week. A question before the meeting was whether the trade war had escalated enough to merit a warning in the statement. Covid's impact on the supply chain continues. The pandemic has disrupted nearly every aspect of the global supply chain and made all kinds of products harder to find. In turn, scarcity has caused the prices of many things to go higher as inflation remains stubbornly high. Almost anything manufactured is in short supply. That includes everything from toilet paper to new cars. The disruptions go back to the beginning of the pandemic, when factories in Asia and Europe were forced to shut down and shipping companies cut their schedules. First, demand for home goods spiked. Money that Americans once spent on experiences were redirected to things for their homes. The surge clogged the system for transporting goods to the factories that needed them and finished products piled up because of a shortage of shipping containers. Now, ports are struggling to keep up. In North America and Europe, where containers are arriving, the heavy influx of ships is overwhelming ports. With warehouses full, containers are piling up. The chaos in global shipping is likely to persist as a result of the massive traffic jam. No one really knows when the crisis will end. Shortages and delays are likely to affect this year's Christmas and holiday shopping season, but what happens after that is unclear. Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, said he expects supply chain problems to persist ""likely well into next year."" The Fed's next move still looks to be a rate increase. Nothing in the statement suggested that officials are worried about growth or prepared to slow their pace of rate increases, a development that defies some recent Fed attempts to leave its options open on next policy moves. Even when the Fed is not raising or cutting rates, it still sends signals to the market about where monetary policy is headed, through subtle, but crucial, changes in language. Some of those recent changes have sent a purposefully muddy signal, apparently meant to demonstrate flexibility to respond to events in the economy.

For example, in his testimony last month, Mr. Powell, the leader of the Federal Open Market Committee, said that ""with a strong job market, inflation close to our objective and the risks to the outlook roughly balanced, the F.O.M.C. believes that -- for now -- the best way forward is to keep gradually raising the federal funds rate."" Analysts saw that phrase and honed in on ""for now."" ""The inclusion of those words diluted the signal for continued gradual tightening, but not necessarily in a dovish or a hawkish way,"" Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist for High Frequency Economics, wrote this week. ""Rather, as we have been discussing, their inclusion continued the recent trend toward reduced forward guidance: The pace of tightening could be stepped up or slowed down, depending on the data."" That still seems possible, particularly from Mr. Powell's recent testimony, but the statement only points one way for now. The Fed will not be bullied. Mr. Trump has made no secret of his disagreement with the Fed's rate increases, tweeting last month that the central bank's moves undercut the United States economy and that its pattern of rate increases ""hurts all that we have done."" The president, who had accused the Fed of keeping interest rates artificially low to help President Barack Obama, now appears ready to blame the central bank for trying to slow down a booming economy. Mr. Powell has insisted the Fed is an independent body that moves in response to economic data, not political pressure. The statement seems to back that up. We'll have to wait for direct questioning at the next meeting, but for now, the Fed is telling Mr. Trump, in its very Fed way, to mind his own business.","Federal Reserve officials upgraded their already high marks for their economy, issuing a statement that keeps them on track to raise rates next month and in December.",c83c9701-af64-5232-984f-c1ea58174309,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/02/business/02-SUB-dc-fed-print/02dc-fed-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9a2eb985dbad5dad2ca1538c366cf17e296f023709b465a991b6cca73e69c7ff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Federal Reserve is expected to leave interest rates unchanged at its August meeting.

Science,"In Age of Trump, Scientists Show Signs of a Political Pulse",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/science/donald-trump-scientists-politics.html,"Michael Eisen, an evolutionary biologist, is among the elite of American scientists, with a tenured position at the University of California, Berkeley, and generous funding from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute for his research on fruit flies. But late last month, dismayed over the Trump administration's apparent disdain for evidence on climate change and other issues, Dr. Eisen registered the Twitter handle @SenatorPhD and declared his intention to run in the 2018 election for a seat in the United States Senate from California. His campaign slogan: ""Liberty, Equality, Reality."" ""I'm not sure I'm the best vehicle for this,"" said Dr. Eisen, whose professional attire consists of shorts and T-shirts bearing mottos supporting open access to scientific literature, a cause he has championed. ""But if we want to defend the role of science in policy making, scientists need to run for office."" Since Mr. Trump's election, many other scientists have expressed concern about rumors and public statements on the new administration's views on science, climate change and the role of federal offices like the Environmental Protection Agency.

Mr. Trump has called climate change a hoax (although more recently said he would have an ""open mind"" about it) and appointed some officials to his transition team who dispute mainstream climate science. But there is much that is still unclear about his administration's attitudes toward science. The president has yet to appoint a science adviser and has not responded to open letters calling on him to do so from science policy groups including the American Association for the Advancement of Science (whose president, Rush D. Holt, is a physicist and former congressman). Few scientists have gone as far as Dr. Eisen, but other researchers are now undergoing a political awakening, contemplating what their role should be for at least the next few years. ""There are many conversations going on right now,"" said Naomi Oreskes, a historian of science at Harvard who spoke at one of the first scientist-led anti-Trump protests, a rally in San Francisco during the annual meeting of the American Geophysical Union in December. ""Many scientists do feel that the time for sitting on the sidelines is past."" A political action committee that seeks to get more scientists and engineers to run for elective office, 314 Action, has seen a surge of interest in its programs, with more than 2,000 people registering at its website. The group is planning a training program for scientist-candidates, whether they want to run for local or state offices or Congress.

But an activist role is not an easy fit for many scientists. ""I have plenty of colleagues who say, 'Leave me alone in my lab,'"" said Jonathan Overpeck, director of the Institute for the Environment at the University of Arizona. Still, he has seen more scientists take at least the first steps toward mobilization. ""Right now it's mostly talking about what to do,"" he said. ""We're scientists -- we tend to plan very carefully what we do and then we try to do it well. But certainly there's an elevated sense that this is very real."" That sense has motivated hundreds of student and faculty volunteers at nearly a dozen universities to participate in ""data rescue"" events over the last two months, the most recent of which was held this weekend at New York University. After a brief training session, participants spent six hours archiving environmental data from government websites, including those of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Interior Department. An anonymous donor has provided storage on Amazon servers, and the information can be searched from a website at the University of Pennsylvania called Data Refuge. Though the Federal Records Act theoretically protects government data from deletion, scientists who rely on it say would rather be safe than sorry. ""For a problem like climate change, you can't understand it if you don't have data,"" said Jerome Whitington, an environmental anthropologist and member of the loose-knit group Environmental Data Governance Initiative, which sponsored the N.Y.U. event.

Much of the concern among scientists has been centered on the E.P.A., which was a favorite target of Mr. Trump during the campaign. Comments by members of his transition team have led to speculation that the new administration would gut the agency's science staff. Although he said he was speaking only for himself, Myron Ebell, who headed the E.P.A. transition but left on Jan. 19, said in a recent interview that science within the agency had become too politicized. ""I'm a great believer in science,"" Mr. Ebell said, ""but I'm not a great believer in politicized science."" Many scientists would argue that it is climate deniers and others who are politicized. The question of whether scientists should take sides politically is an old one, with the widespread and long-held view among many researchers that they should be quiet and let their data speak for itself. Some scientists have objected to plans for the Washington march, arguing that the event will feed the view among many conservatives that scientists have a political agenda. But the idea that they should be above the fray has been slowly unraveling as researchers realize that their own aloofness may largely be to blame for public disregard for the evidence on issues like climate change or vaccine safety. And in the era of Trump, some say it could finally come completely apart.

Youth is leading the way in rejecting the old view, Mr. Rosenberg said. ""Early career scientists, younger scientists -- that's not an answer for them,"" he said. Chanda Prescod-Weinstein, a cosmologist and particle physicist at the University of Washington, is one of those younger researchers. She has long been politically active -- she comes from a family of organizers and attended her first demonstration when she was 2 months old -- but for her the talk and actions of the Trump administration have led to a new level of concern. Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said she was especially incensed by what she and others viewed as efforts by some science organizations to reach out to the Trump administration. Immediately after the election, she took to social media to criticize a news release from the American Physical Society that urged President Trump to strengthen scientific leadership and quoted his campaign slogan, ""Make America Great Again."" ""What history has taught us is that collaboration doesn't work for science,"" Dr. Prescod-Weinstein said. ""When we work with extremist, racist, Islamophobic or nationalist governments, it doesn't work for science."" The news release was quickly withdrawn and the society apologized for any ""offense it might have caused.""

Michael Lubell, a physics professor who was director of public affairs for the society but who was terminated without explanation, said that ""initially people were very worried that if anybody criticized Donald Trump there would be retribution."" ""People are now getting to the point where they are understanding that this is a guy in the White House who doesn't have a firm grasp on science policy at all,"" Dr. Lubell said. ""Now they are mobilizing. But there's absolutely no strategy."" Dr. Eisen, the Berkeley biologist, would seem to have slim chances of winning a race for the Senate, since it is sure to be joined by several prominent Democrats if Dianne Feinstein, the longtime incumbent, decides not to run. But Jacquelyn Gill, a paleo-ecologist at the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute, has been actively recruited to -- eventually -- make a bid for a congressional seat by 314 Action, ever since she was quoted in the journal Nature urging her fellow scientists to ""do more than write letters."" Staff members at 314 Action (which takes its name from the number pi) liked her attitude, and she happens to live in a swing district. Like many academic scientists, Dr. Gill employs several graduate students in her laboratory and has received grant funds for research that is still in progress. But the idea of public service, at what she considers an urgent time for climate science, is tugging at her. ""I came into this career wanting to do science that's in the public good,"" she said. ""And maybe now that means something different than it did before.""","Alarmed by the administration's apparent disdain for science, members of a profession that is often loath to take sides are starting to take a stand.",3f212ea2-2c1d-5484-9580-1ec9d3d407de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/04/science/07SCIENTIST1/07SCIENTIST1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=d53937a2b6ca1b8834e0883ce34f0b7b752d936a73da1072a8967a7fd14cc72d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michael Eisen in his lab at the University of California in Berkeley, Calif.

Fashion & Style,Kate Spade's Last Collection,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/08/fashion/kate-spade-frances-valentine-last-collection.html,"In June, not long after the designer Kate Spade was found dead by suicide, the employees of Frances Valentine, the accessories label she helped found in 2016, gathered around an oval table. They were in their airy headquarters, a former artist's studio that looks more like the pied-a-terre of a magpie tastemaker than an antiseptic company showroom. ""We just thought, 'Can we go on?'"" said Elyce Arons, the chief executive and a founder of the label (as well as Ms. Spade's best friend from college), sitting at that table two months later. Ms. Arons was framed by paintings by Julian Schnabel and Rene Ricard from the collection of Andy Spade, Ms. Spade's partner in both life and work; two velvet sofas; a bar cart; and assorted shoes and handbags. After all, the label was less than two years old, just beginning to take root (it has only 10 full-time employees) and emotionally rent. Ms. Arons was not the only one asking the question.

This week everyone got an answer. A series of collections will roll out over the next months of Ms. Spade's designs -- before her death she had overseen the current fall collection as well as the soon-to-be-available resort collection and the coming spring line -- as well as homages to her as guiding spirit. All of them are marked by the same interaction between the person and the product that made her work so intensely appealing to its dedicated client base. There's a story behind every piece, most of them grounded in Ms. Spade's own mythology and worldview.

""We had such an outpouring from customers saying, 'Please keep the company going,' Ms. Arons said. ""It became obvious that's what we needed to do: Go forward and honor Katy.""

First up (at least after the reorders of the fall collection, much of which sold out within a week of going online Aug. 1) is the Kate, a new version of the first bag Ms. Spade made. Originally called the H120 -- ""H"" for ""horizontal,"" and ""120"" to obscure the fact it was the first; maybe it was the 120th! -- it was the label's debut style in 1994 at a trade show at the Javits Convention Center. It caught the eye of Barneys New York. The reborn bag, which will cost $195 (a percentage of sales will go to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America), is a minimal nylon satchel in primary shades with a gold zipper across the top and a signature embroidered valentine heart inside: utility for the light of heart, which is kind of a Spade thing.

See, for example, the canvas tote that makes an appearance for resort. It features a sketch of Ms. Spade made by her friend Matt Grenby of Parker Thatch, when he and his wife were on vacation with Kate and Andy: her hair in its signature messy updo, thick-framed glasses perched on her nose, martini in hand. Or see the tutti-frutti hula bag, complete with generous fringe. Or, for that matter, a dress -- ""the accessory to our accessories,"" Ms. Arons said -- that is about to go online for pre-order: a bright red traditional Mexican smock embroidered in white peacocks and inspired by one of the many Mexican dresses in Ms. Spade's own closet.

""We took a big, big family trip together to Mexico in 2006 after we sold our first company, and we did a lot of dress shopping,"" Ms. Arons said. ""She loved to shop in markets, and she'd always come back with baskets and hats."" There's also going to be a vintage-inspired cardigan stitched with multicolor flowers that echoes one of Ms. Spade's own sweaters on offer. (A clothing rack in the showroom is still jammed with many of her pieces, including a geometric Marni coat, a vintage pale yellow 1940s tea dress, and a richly tinted evening skirt, all of which were often used as the wardrobe for the company's campaigns and look books .)

""She's the best editor I know,"" said Ms. Arons, who has a tendency to use the present tense when talking about Ms. Spade, before catching herself. ""We'd do all this work, and she'd look at it and say, 'I love it, but we need to focus.' We could lose half a collection. But we still have everything that was cut. Now we can do it all. She'd be happy about it."" Ms. Arons looked at another bag for spring, which features a classic portrait of a gentleman -- who happens to be Katy and Andy's Maltese, Po. ""Her designs live here,"" she said.",The late designer is still very much present in the new accessories from her Frances Valentine label.,b06266b9-8108-51d7-9355-163d5341313c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/09/fashion/09katespade1/09katespade1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=872b735ab3e4f3212b9190c4efb1f293b4e608098890b2656770173433aea6e9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,At the airy Frances Valentine headquarters in New York.,b06266b9-8108-51d7-9355-163d5341313c,N24News/imgs/b06266b9-8108-51d7-9355-163d5341313c.jpg,19
Movies,'Hot Air' Review: A Right-Wing Radio Host Learns to Love Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/22/movies/hot-air-review.html,"Don't get too excited about the prospect of Steve Coogan playing an American right-wing radio host.

Sports,"At the U.S. Open, Doubles, of All Things, Stays Stable",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/sports/tennis/us-open-doubles.html,"The men's and women's doubles draws at the United States Open this year are stacked with former Grand Slam doubles champions as well as new and exciting partnerships. While doubles may not have the same cachet as the singles tournaments among casual fans, there are still plenty of exciting players to watch -- some because they are paired up. Here are a few teams to watch out for as the week progresses: The two Colombians have paired together once again, and are going for their third Grand Slam doubles title after having won together at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2019. Although both are in their early 30s, their success has only come in the last few years. The two did not play together for the Australian Open this year, after Farah tested positive for anabolic steroids and was suspended from tournament play. Farah argued against the charge, and the International Tennis Federation rescinded his ban earlier this year. Kubot and Melo each hold two Grand Slam titles, including one they share from a victory at Wimbledon in 2017, and others from previous partnerships. The two have played together consistently since 2017, reaching the U.S. Open final in 2018 before losing to Mike Bryan and Jack Sock. They beat the top-seeded Cabal and Farah in the finals of the Mexican Open in February, and will hope to repeat that performance on the faster-paced courts in New York.

Ram and Salisbury are relatively new partners who began playing together consistently at the beginning of 2019. But they quickly showed their strengths, winning two tournaments in 2019, in Qatar and Vienna. They went on to win the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam for either of them. They will hope to take that momentum forward, especially considering that the U.S. Open hardcourts are most similar to the courts on which they secured their championship in Melbourne. The pair of 35-year-olds from the Balkans started playing together in the middle of last year, and quickly won two highly coveted titles in Cincinnati and at the China Open in Beijing. Dodig holds one Grand Slam title, from the 2015 French Open with Marcelo Melo, while his partner has not yet been past the semifinals of a Grand Slam. Dodig and Polasek also have collective experience. Together, they went to the semifinals of Wimbledon in 2019 as well as at the Australian Open this year. The two are an exceptionally formidable pair and will be sure to keep pushing for titles as they try to beat the clock.

Babos and Mladenovic have won three Grand Slam titles together, their latest coming at the Australian Open this year. Although Mladenovic has had some success on the singles tour, reaching a peak rating of No. 10, Babos is a doubles specialist. Babos and Mladenovic are also exceptionally dominant in the WTA Finals, where they have won for the past three years in a row. No doubt, even with the lengthy forced break, the pair will be back to their dominant winning ways. Mertens and Sabalenka, the defending champions, are two young and exceptionally talented players. In the last four Grand Slam tournaments, they have not lost before the quarterfinals, a rare level of consistency, especially for a pair that only began working together at the beginning of 2019. Both players are better known for their successes on the singles tour, but they have become the rare pair that can compete seriously in both formats, and should be paid more attention as they storm through the world of doubles.

This is the pair's first year playing together, and they struggled at the beginning of 2020, losing in the first round at the Australian Open. However, the pair has had some success separately in the past. Melichar reached the final at Wimbledon in 2018 in women's doubles as well as winning the title in mixed doubles. Xu reached the final at Wimbledon in 2019. Together, the two can be a formidable pair, especially on faster playing surfaces like Wimbledon or the U.S. Open. Peschke, at 45, and Schuurs, at 27, have one of the biggest age gaps in doubles tennis. They began working together at the beginning of the year, and while they have not had much success so far, their performances improved throughout the Australia swing at the beginning of 2020. Peschke, who previously played with Nicole Melichar, is an incredibly intelligent doubles player, and won Wimbledon in 2011 with Katarina Srebotnik. Schuurs has yet to make it past the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam, but has previously won three Premier titles, twice while paired up with singles No. 1 Ashleigh Barty and once with Elise Mertens. Here are a few more pairings to watch. The two singles specialists are pairing up for this year's doubles draw. Azarenka reached the finals last year alongside Ashleigh Barty, and has the potential to do so again with this year's Australian Open singles champion. This Midwestern duo reached the quarterfinals in Flushing last year, and Sock won the U.S. Open doubles championship in 2018 alongside Mike Bryan. These Americans are a pleasure to watch, and have the potential to go all the way. These two young Americans are rightly heralded as the future of American tennis. Although they lost in the third round of last year's U.S. Open to Victoria Azarenka and Ashleigh Barty, they are aggressive.","Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah return to defend their titles, as do Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, in two packed and experienced doubles draws.",b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/31/sports/31usopen-lineups-doubles-1/31usopen-lineups-doubles-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5cbb4fbefbff6c7396c836bbe560755ea57bd7aad930196bf6e253de51ea3677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Farah, right, and Juan Sebastián Cabal celebrated after winning men's doubles at the U.S. Open last year.",b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62,N24News/imgs/b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62.jpg,9
Sports,The N.B.A. Should Crown a Champion. But Will the Title Count?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/sports/basketball/nba-champion-lebron-giannis-lakers.html,"Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here. Asterisks have long been a fickle form of punctuation in the N.B.A. They tend to be subjectively attached to certain championships and, even then, don't always stick. Some of the loudest asterisk talk in league history followed the San Antonio Spurs' championship in the 1999 season, which was shortened to 50 regular-season games because of a lockout. Phil Jackson, who did not coach that season, unforgettably started and amplified that campaign, hypothesizing that a compact schedule diminished San Antonio's achievement. Then he admitted in a 2011 radio interview that he was ""poking fun"" at the Spurs, presumably for potential mind-game benefits later. Seemingly no one, by contrast, brings up the ""A"" word when 2011-12 comes up. When was the last time it was suggested in any meaningful way that LeBron James's first championship, won with the Miami Heat after a work stoppage shortened that season to 66 games, did not measure up to a typical title? Such sentiments tend to be associated more with the '99 Spurs, thanks to the pot-stirring Jackson, or with the 1993-94 Houston Rockets. That team just helped Rudy Tomjanovich earn a spot in the Basketball Hall of Fame's 2020 class after a lengthy wait, but Hakeem Olajuwon, Rudy T. and Co. have been reminded ever since that the first championship in Rockets history was not secured until after Michael Jordan abruptly switched sports and became an outfielder for the Birmingham Barons.

Yet we suddenly appear headed for an asterisk that will be mandatory rather than abstract -- in this season's best-case scenario and maybe in its worst. Whether the N.B.A. resumes the season or ends without a champion for the first time in its 74 years, there will be no entry in the record book like the 2019-20 campaign. ""Every N.B.A. finals ever has been a best-of-seven,"" said Todd Spehr, an N.B.A. historian. ""I suppose you could list several subjective asterisks if you wanted to reference various injuries that have happened in the finals, but this would be new territory. If you take a hole out of the last portion of the season and then present a modified postseason, it will always be considered abnormal."" Let's keep things hopeful for now. Let's imagine that the dire circumstances caused by the coronavirus outbreak improve expeditiously, enabling the N.B.A. to play on this summer. The problem: Even an optimist can imagine the dismissive things sure to be said about the team that conquered a postseason that, as Spehr hinted, is likely to feature games in an empty arena and a format scaled back from four rounds of best-of-seven matchups.

For James in particular, at age 35, the clock is ticking fast. You have to wonder, though: How would we really look at Giannis and the Bucks, in our rings-are-everything sports culture, if they emerged victorious from a regular season and postseason that fell short of the N.B.A.'s 82-game and 16-playoff-win norms? How much credit would LeBron get for the leading the Lakers to such a crown? What sort of minimum playoff structure would it take, for Kawhi and the Clippers (or anyone else), to satisfy the masses that this was a representative season? Perhaps the basketball public, grateful just to have the game back in any form, would be unusually forgiving. ""The '99 Spurs played 50 games in 88 days, swept the Lakers even though L.A. had essentially the same personnel that would win it all in 2000, and beat a deep Trail Blazers team before beating the Knicks in the finals,"" Spehr said. ""That was a hard title to win. Yet Phil's asterisk comment has sort of stuck."" ""The word 'asterisk' is always interpreted negatively,"" Spehr continued. ""It should signify that it was 'different,' not 'worse.' But the 2019-20 season has been irrevocably altered, so if we are even fortunate to get a finals, it's going to be in its own historical place."" We are 27 days into the N.B.A.'s shutdown. There have been more than 350,000 known coronavirus cases in the United States -- and more than 10,000 deaths. Fears are mounting that a comeback in July or even August is an unrealistic expectation for any pro sports league unless the coronavirus outbreak eases significantly in coming weeks.

The league will surely postpone the May 19 draft lottery and outright cancel its annual Chicago predraft camp from May 21 to 24. Yet I agree with the smart tweets posted on Friday night by the Lakers' Jared Dudley, who suggested that the N.B.A. is likely to wait until at least June 1 before it makes binding decisions about the fate of the rest of the season. Too much money has already been lost in 2019-20 to be hasty. N.B.A. Commissioner Adam Silver has made it clear that he will not try to restart league play without the requisite government directives and support from public health experts, but there are no prizes and little discernible upside in rushing to a cancellation. Giving itself as much runway as possible to craft some semblance of a palatable finish -- for as long as the league can hold out until the delay injures the 2020-21 season -- is the N.B.A.'s best play. Just know, for future reference, that things are sure to eventually get noisy on this seemingly trivial front, whether we get the dream scenario of a rebooted season or the N.B.A.'s answer to Major League Baseball's strike-shortened 1994 season, which was halted with the playoffs approaching and ended without a champion. Silver seemed to acknowledge how weighty these historical matters can be, at least within the N.B.A. community, in a recent interview with ESPN's Rachel Nichols. Asked whether he planned to anoint Houston's James Harden (34.4 points per game) as the 2019-20 scoring champion if the rest of the season is canceled, Silver said: ""I'm not there yet. I mean, we'll figure it out. I hope I'm not just in denial, but I'm just not there yet."" Instinct tells me that there will surely be calls for Silver to affix a league-administered asterisk to the record book entries from whatever conclusion takes shape.

You ask; I answer. Every week in this space, I'll field three questions posed via email at marcstein-newsletter@nytimes.com. (Please include your first and last name, as well as the city you're writing in from, and make sure ""Corner Three"" is in the subject line.) Q: I think you can make the case for several players for the Defensive Player of the Year Award. My top four are Giannis Antetokounmpo, Rudy Gobert, Anthony Davis and Ben Simmons. Who would be your pick at this point? -- Andy Roth (New York) Stein: I have the same final four. Trying to narrow the field down to a winner will be rough for the actual voters*, provided that the league intends to go ahead with individual awards regardless of whether it resumes the season. My view is that award voting can and should go ahead, no matter what, given that nearly 80 percent of the regular season was completed. As the two-time reigning D.P.O.Y., Gobert is always in this conversation, but he is bound to slip out of the top three on final ballots this time because of voter fatigue and up-and-down Utah's slide to an uncharacteristic No. 11 in defensive efficiency. Philadelphia's Simmons is likely a long shot for the top prize, too, even though he leads the league in steals and ranks second in deflections as one of the league's most active and versatile individual defenders. The competition is just too tough. Davis is widely regarded as one of the prime sparks for the Lakers' rise from 13th in defensive efficiency last season to third this season. Davis's own versatility and mobility are key in driving the Lakers' ultra-big lineups, and, as a bonus, he rightfully gets a big slice of the credit for goading LeBron James into becoming a more defensively engaged Laker this season.

All that good work, though, may not be enough to nudge Davis past Antetokounmpo, who anchors the league's top-ranked defense in Milwaukee. The Bucks have several other quality defenders -- Brook and Robin Lopez, Eric Bledsoe, Khris Middleton and Wesley Matthews -- but Antetokounmpo is the space-eater whose size, length, speed and strength make the opposition feel him every time it has the ball. Consider that the Bucks allow a mere 101.6 points per 100 possessions to sit atop the defensive efficiency charts yet that figure dips to a measly 96.5 points per 100 possessions when Antetokounmpo is on the floor. There will be strong sentiment among voters to make Giannis just the third player in league history to win the Most Valuable Player Award and D.P.O.Y. honors in the same season, joining Michael Jordan and Hakeem Olajuwon, although my gut tells me Davis was in the lead when the season was suspended. Q: Hey @chicagobulls you can't even get an interview with an assistant G.M. Nobody wants to be associated/work with John Paxson and Reinsdorf. -- @matt_samuelson_ from Twitter Stein: Your dismay is understood, but the Bulls' situation isn't quite that dire. Although they've indeed missed out on three candidates they wanted to interview to lead a front-office overhaul, two well-regarded candidates remain in contention even after it was made clear that Toronto's Bobby Webster, Miami's Adam Simon and Indiana's Chad Buchanan would not be participating in the interview process. Utah's Justin Zanik and Denver's Arturas Karnisovas, Chicago's first two interviewees, are highly rated. The Bulls will be lauded if they land either of them. Chicago has made the playoffs once in the past five seasons. Fan frustration with the owner Jerry Reinsdorf and the front-office duo of John Paxson and Gar Forman has been bubbling for far longer than that. Hopes that ownership would pursue the likes of Toronto's Masai Ujiri or Oklahoma City's Sam Presti were snuffed out quickly, presumably because the Bulls are not prepared to compete financially for executives from the league's top tier -- but also because they can't attract such candidates. The job simply isn't as desirable as it should be in a major market and considering Chicago's storied history, given the state of the roster and the organization's sullied reputation. The Bulls will have to prove to candidates that they're prepared to move on from Paxson and Forman, grant true autonomy and provide the financial resources necessary to plot a path back to Eastern Conference contention. Your skepticism can be heard in league circles, too, and Chicago has certainly earned it. But the search, led this time by Reinsdorf's son Michael, is also in its infancy. It's too soon to sound (all) the alarms.

Kevin Garnett (1995), Kobe Bryant (1996) and Tim Duncan (1997), who headlined Saturday's announcement of the Basketball Hall of Fame's class for 2020, were selected in three successive N.B.A. drafts and combined for 11 championships and 48 All-Star selections. As my pal @ByTimReynolds of The Associated Press noted, only six players in league history have earned at least 15 All-Star nods -- Garnett, Bryant and Duncan account for half of that group. The three others are Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Shaquille O'Neal and LeBron James. Rudy Tomjanovich, who was named to the Hall of Fame's 2020 class after spending more than three decades with the Houston Rockets, is one of just nine coaches in league history to win back-to-back championships and one of 14 to win at least two titles. Tomjanovich also earned five All-Star selections as a Rockets forward, but Hall of Fame rules mandate that playing and coaching careers are judged separately. Three of the 14 coaches in the two-championships-minimum club are still active: San Antonio's Gregg Popovich (five titles), Golden State's Steve Kerr (three) and Miami's Erik Spoelstra (two). The others are: Phil Jackson (11), Red Auerbach (nine), John Kundla (five), Pat Riley (five), Chuck Daly (two), Alex Hannum (two), Tommy Heinsohn (two), Red Holzman (two), K.C. Jones (two), Bill Russell (two) and Tomjanovich. The Hornets played a league-leading 17 one-possession games before the N.B.A. indefinitely suspended the season on March 11, meaning that 26 percent of Charlotte's 65 games were decided by 3 points or fewer. Milwaukee (3-1) and Golden State (1-3) are tied with a league-low four games decided by 3 points or fewer. Western Conference teams have posted a cumulative record of 199-164 in games against Eastern Conference teams this season, good for a .548 winning percentage.

Television,"'True Detective' Season 3, Episode 7: Missing Pieces",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/17/arts/television/true-detective-recap.html,"The documentary-within-a-show in this season's ""True Detective"" has served as half illumination and half meta-commentary, a way to tease new thoughts from Detective Hays's addled mind while taking shots at the current wave of true-crime docs, which have a tendency to dally around unresolved tragedies. Its director, Elisa Montgomery, may speak loftily about ""the intersectionality of marginalized groups,"" but she is passing through Hays's life like a tourist, gawking at 35 years of dead ends, bad breaks and unfortunate lapses in judgment. And at the end of her stay, all Elisa can do is express disappointment over her visit: She knew he shared her skepticism over how the case was resolved, but he couldn't provide her with ""a missing piece."" ""Young lady,"" he replies. ""my whole brain's a bunch of missing pieces."" That sounds like a typical Nic Pizzolatto line, another salty lament from the bottom of the bottle. It's a feature of the show that Pizzolatto's detectives are broken people, because of either defining incidents from their past or their obsessions with the one big case that got away from them. Yet when Hays describes his brain as ""a bunch of missing pieces,"" it accounts for the entire design of the third season, which reflects how memory works. Over three timelines, the show has given us pieces of a puzzle that have never fit to Hays's satisfaction, prompting him to circle back over assumptions and conclusions that haven't stood up under scrutiny. By 2015, there are no borders in Hays's mind between one time period and another: his visitation by the Viet Cong; his late-night wandering to the Purcells' old neighborhood; and, in this episode, his memory of burning a man's clothes in the backyard to cover up an interrogation gone wrong.

For Elisa, interviewing Hays has been a frustrating act of excavation, as if she were spelunking into the dark, cavernous reaches of his mind to discover some elusive gem. She's ticked that she doesn't find it, but Pizzolatto suggests that she hasn't earned it: This case has inspired her curiosity, but she hasn't lived through its cascading tragedies and disappointments, so she doesn't have the right to see it through. The nifty little twist in ""The Final Country"" is that Hays and West are using her for information, taking her theories on the case and following through on them after the shoot. The one-eyed man whom they had originally questioned about buying the corn husk dolls in 1980 -- the same man who castigated Amelia at a book reading a decade later -- is identified as a possible ""procurer"" for a pedophile ring. That leads the elderly partners to interview a former domestic worker at the Hoyt estate, who describes a one-eyed man who worked closely with Hoyt and the secretive goings-on that led to her departure. By now it's clear that some unseen hand has been dictating where the investigation has gone. In 1980, the planting of Will's backpack under the floorboards on Woodard's deck was enough to close the case and pin both murders on the dead scavenger, despite Julie's body never turning up. In 1990, Tom's apparent suicide at Devil's Den is staged to accomplish the same goal of putting the case to rest with the deceased. And when Hays and West tried, as free agents, to torture the truth out of Harris James, the gambit backfired so horribly that they couldn't look into it any longer. A man in a black sedan has likely made certain of that. The bigger picture is starting to come into focus. Through Amelia's sleuthing in the 1990 timeline, we discover that cousin Dan had some discussions with the one-eyed man at the bar where Lucy once worked. Through phone records and flight logs we also discover, again in 1990, that calls were exchanged between Lucy and a Hoyt number, and that Harris flew to Vegas the night before Lucy was found dead from an overdose. The dots are not quite connectable yet, but Hoyt, Harris, Lucy, Dan and the one-eyed man are all playing roles here, and no one, not least Hays and West, have had the power and political will to get to the bottom of it.

The past few episodes of ""True Detective"" have busied themselves with unpacking this horrific conspiracy, but this week's episode was especially effective in measuring the bruising cost of it -- not just to our ragged heroes, but to the community at large. An incidental moment from the 1990 timeline hits the hardest: After Amelia visits one of the Purcell's neighbors and procures a photograph of Will and Julie on Halloween, she asks the woman if she has ever thought about moving to town, away from this cursed place. ""Why would I?"" the woman replies. ""Somebody's got to stay. Somebody's got to remember."" There are more mundane reasons that people continue to live in towns and neighborhoods like this after those communities have collapsed. But home is home, even when staying feels like tending a graveyard.
* One mystery that hasn't been addressed is why Hays is estranged from his daughter Becca, but leaving that an open question makes her continued presence in his life more affecting. Here Hays is focused on a point of departure -- first in a flashback when he drops her off at college, later when his dementia leads him to mistake a witness's daughter for his own -- and it seems possible that this may have been his last happy memory of her.
* Amelia's dropping a mention of ""In Cold Blood"" signals Pizzolatto's own ambitions, for better or worse. ""True Detective"" was intended to be more than just another gruesome police procedural, even if it buckles under the weight of this pretension half the time.
* This season has been building around the existence of a pedophile ring, but it has shown blessed restraint by not getting too explicit about it. The show hasn't always favored leaving humanity's ugliest impulses to the imagination.
* So yes, the third season and the first season do exist in the same televisual universe. Let's hope the Marvel-style crossovers end there.",It is becoming clear that some unseen hand has been dictating where the investigation has gone.,7dbf1424-879a-5617-86d4-ac700ad95945,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/18/arts/television/18truedetective-recap/18truedetective-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=91a36dc3864f5d18e31410f786bc83ed475430bca2a822a739e01ce7f001402f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mahershala Ali in a scene from ""True Detective.""",7dbf1424-879a-5617-86d4-ac700ad95945,N24News/imgs/7dbf1424-879a-5617-86d4-ac700ad95945.jpg,3

Television,'S.N.L.' Is Sorry: A Brief History of the Show's (Sort Of) Apologies,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/arts/television/snl-apologies.html,"How will ""Saturday Night Live"" deal with the hubbub it created by hiring -- and then hurriedly firing -- the comic Shane Gillis a few weeks ago? Will it at all? This wasn't an issue that could be addressed on-air while the show was still dark. But with its return this weekend for the first episode of Season 45, it will be interesting to see whether ""S.N.L."" will acknowledge its lapse in judgment in hiring a comedian who was known in the comedy world for racist, sexist and homophobic humor, which stirred up plenty of criticism. There are a number of ways the show might attempt to make amends -- over the last 44 years, it has had occasion to try most of them. While we wait to see what happens on Saturday night, here's a look back at how ""S.N.L."" has handled past flaps. (Note: We're focusing on responses that happened within the show itself, so won't get into things like Mike Myers's apology to the Clintons over a tasteless ""Wayne's World"" joke about Chelsea.) The French pop singer and actress Claudine Longet was arrested in 1976 for shooting and killing her lover, the pro skier Vladimir ""Spider"" Sabich. Longet claimed the shooting was an accident, which ""S.N.L."" spoofed near the end of its first season.

The sketch featuring stock footage of skiers wiping out on the slopes, with overdubbed gunfire, as the TV announcers (Chevy Chase and Jane Curtin) commented on a strange wave of ""accidental"" skier shootings. ""That looked almost like skeet shooting!"" Curtin says. ""You must mean ski shooting!"" Chase replies. Longet's lawyer wasn't laughing, and he sent ""S.N.L."" a cease-and-desist letter. In the following week's episode, the announcer Don Pardo read a statement on air -- the show's first public apology: ""It is desirable to correct any misunderstanding that a suggestion was made that, in fact, a crime had been committed. The satire was fictitious and its intent only humorous. This is a statement of apology if the material was misinterpreted."" Longet was later convicted of negligent homicide and sentenced to 30 days in jail. Bill Murray Wants to Do Better In a 1977 bit, Bill Murray offered a heartfelt mea culpa, not for bad taste but for bad comedy, apologizing for his lackluster performances to date. ""I don't think I'm making it on the show,"" he said. ""I'm a funny guy, but I haven't been so funny on the show."" The monologue was funny because it was true: When Chevy Chase left ""S.N.L.,"" Murray replaced him and has since discussed how much he struggled in the early days. ""If you could see it in your heart to laugh whenever I say something,"" he told viewers in 1977. ""I don't care what it is ..."" They came around.

When Oprah Winfrey hosted in 1986, she emphasized the show's lack of quality material for black female cast members and guests in an opening sketch that would be echoed years later by Kerry Washington. In this Season 11 episode, producer Lorne Michaels knocks on Winfrey's dressing-room door to ask why she hasn't changed into her Aunt Jemima costume. She tells him that won't be happening. ""Like I said, I don't do Aunt Jemima,"" Winfrey says, adding, ""And furthermore, I'm not doing the maid sketch. I'm not doing the Br'er Rabbit sketch. And you can just forget about me in the refrigerator repair sketch."" Not an apology, exactly, but this was a dialogue the show would continue to have with itself, its viewers and its critics.

In maybe the most famous ""S.N.L."" controversy of them all, Sinead O'Connor in 1992 ended an a cappella performance of Bob Marley's ""War,"" in which she changed some of the lyrics to address child abuse, by tearing up a picture of Pope John Paul II and saying, ""Fight the real enemy."" Her message -- that the Catholic Church had a sex abuse problem -- was lost in the ensuing uproar. ""S.N.L."" responded the following week, when the host Joe Pesci devoted his monologue to criticizing O'Connor, saying he would have given her ""such a smack"" -- which somehow did not court controversy -- and presented the ripped-up pope photo taped back together. And there was more: A few episodes later, Madonna presented a photo of tabloid sex-scandal figure Joey Buttafucco and repeated O'Connor's words: ""Fight the real enemy."" And Jan Hooks's later impression of the singer was featured as an occasion to boo her. Mocking O'Connor's message didn't necessarily atone for what had happened, but it distanced the show from the singer's political statement, which the network deemed to be anti-Catholic. ""I know she has what she sees as very valid reasons for doing it,"" Michaels said in a 1993 interview. ""We were sort of shocked, the way you would be shocked at a houseguest [expletive] on a flower arrangement in the dining room.""

When Alec Baldwin, as a scoutmaster, tried to seduce the Adam Sandler character Canteen Boy in a 1994 sketch, many people were outraged, claiming the sketch was homophobic, made light of pedophilia and defamed the Boy Scouts of America. In subsequent re-airings, ""S.N.L."" added a disclaimer, noting that Sandler's character is actually a 27-year-old ""who, despite his age, remains active in scouting."" Baldwin attempted to make amends when he returned to host the show later in that year. ""Some people got the wrong idea,"" he said, claiming that the sketch provoked 300,000 angry phone calls to the NBC switchboard and that the network lost seven affiliates. And across the ocean, he claimed, Sinead O'Connor ripped up a picture of Canteen Boy during a London concert. To ""foster healing and tolerance,"" as Baldwin said, he and Sandler re-performed the sketch as a play called ""Out of the Tent and Proud: A Politically Correct Version of Canteen Boy,"" in which the scoutmaster asked for permission before touching the character rechristened Consenting Bisexual Canteen Person. (He declined.)

Martin Lawrence's opening monologue in a 1994 episode took a strange turn when he veered into a bit about female hygiene. ""I'm watching douche commercials on television, and I'm wondering if some of you are reading the instructions,"" he said, among other things. This portion of Lawrence's monologue has been removed from tapes of the broadcast and replaced by a title card and voice-over explaining the excision: ""Although we at 'Saturday Night Live' take no stand on this issue one way or another, network policy prevents us from rebroadcasting this portion of his remarks."" In conclusion, the voice-over said, ""It was a frank and lively presentation, and nearly cost us all our jobs."" Fred Armisen had a recurring bit in which he impersonated then Gov. David Paterson on ""Weekend Update."" Paterson, who is legally blind, was not amused by Armisen wandering into shots on the show, so he came on ""Weekend Update"" in 2010 to explain why.

In a 2013 attempt to address the lack of black female ""S.N.L."" cast members, Kerry Washington was featured struggling to be Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey and Beyonce all in one sketch. Through a voice-over and scrolling text on the screen, producers of ""S.N.L."" apologized to Washington for the overload of characters and explained that she was saddled with the bit because she had ""considerable range and talent"" -- and that there was no one else who could do the job (since ""S.N.L."" hadn't had a black woman in its cast for six years). ""We agree that this is not an ideal situation and look forward to rectifying it in the near future,"" the announcer said. ""Unless, of course, we fall in love with another white guy first."" A few months later, the show hired two black women, Leslie Jones and LaKendra Tookes, as writers. In an opening monologue in 2017, Larry David joked about checking out women in a concentration camp and what pickup lines to use. (""You know, if we ever get out of here, I'd love to take you out for some latkes. You like latkes?"") The Anti-Defamation League called the routine ""offensive, insensitive and unfunny all at the same time."" David didn't apologize but he acknowledged the incident the following week, when he returned as Bernie Sanders and said Democrats needed to crack down on politically incorrect humor, ""like these comics out there who think it's O.K. to make jokes about concentration camps -- that guy should rot in hell.""","Will ""Saturday Night Live"" address the Shane Gillis flap in its Season 45 premiere this weekend?

Automobiles,High-Performance Machines With Zero Horsepower,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/automobiles/high-performance-machines-with-zero-horsepower.html,"Imagine your new Lamborghini racing down the road, the wind tousling your hair, the tires straining through a corner, the adrenaline pumping. And then it starts to rain. This is a problem: your Lambo is a bicycle. A $32,000 bicycle, no less. And you hate it when it gets dirty. Through the decades, automobiles and two-wheel (or one-wheel) conveyances lacking motors have coexisted, usually peacefully. And today's racecars and racing bikes have some technology, engineering and style in common. So it's perhaps not surprising that some of the most advanced premium bicycles are designed by, or sold by, automobile companies. Ferrari has had a longstanding association with Colnago, a maker of road-racing bikes in Cambiago, Italy. McLaren once had an arrangement with Specialized, an American bike maker, for a limited production run. Volkswagen has sold Trek editions of some cars, with bike included. Porsche's current pair of bicycles come out of a partner's plant in Germany, and at one point Audi sold a limited-edition bike with a wooden frame.

While bicycle engineering is generally one way, borrowing on the vehicles' colors, logos and material textures, sometimes the sharing filters up from the bike manufacturers to the car engineers. Take the very limited-edition Aston Martin One-77, created by Bf1 Systems, which devises electrical systems for Formula One racers. The One-77 (only 77 were made) has a touch screen integrated into the handlebars; sensors provide data on speed, power and cadence. Chris Lambiase, group publisher for Rodale, which publishes Bicycling magazine, said Bf1 ""didn't have the resources to build out their technology in a car, so they thought, 'Hey, let's do a bicycle.' "" So how is it? A writer for Cyclist magazine in Britain who had an opportunity to audition the $38,500 One-77 ""for the briefest of spins"" wrote that in a sprint, ""the wheels might tuck under as the bike flicks from side to side. This, added to the knowledge that a spill could end up with you having to sell a kidney, makes for a very nervous ride."" The French company Peugeot made bicycles for European customers as early as 1882, years before the Peugeot brothers built their first automobile. The first bicycle, built by Armand Peugeot, was a high-wheeler called a penny farthing. Peugeot bikes were often ridden in international championship series, and they developed a wide following in the 1960s in the United States because of their light weight and affordability. Prominent European brands have cornered this market, with a smattering of Japanese entries and one-offs; Ford and General Motors don't bother. (In 2011, G.M. pulled a print ad that advised college students to ""Stop pedaling ... start driving"" after it provoked a consumer reaction.) Chrysler, of course, has ties to Fiat and Ferrari, which both offer bicycles, and its Jeep division puts its name on mass-market bikes.

In general, however, one won't find high-end models in the local bike shop or at mass-market merchants. They are available usually in limited editions, through the automakers' lifestyle boutiques and online accessory catalogs. ""At the higher end of the cycling market, cyclists tend to be car people -- and watch people,"" Mr. Lambiase said. ""There's appreciation of what I call art in motion: a psychological connection among cars and bikes and performance -- beautiful and precise machinery."" For the right buyers, usually the affluent, Mr. Lambiase says, ""it's the aesthetic details, the paint job, the leather on the saddle, which makes them special."" He added, ""They take these bikes seriously, and if they have the passion for the auto brand, they buy them."" Automakers that offer bikes say they are low-volume, niche products that contribute only fractional revenue. For example, a BMW spokeswoman, Nicole Fallenbeck, said that in 2012 the German company sold 650 branded bikes in the United States. Here's a closer look at four bikes sold though carmakers: BMW The company says it borrows design engineering from the motorized side of its business and has been refining its bikes for more than six decades. BMW bicycles sold in the United States range from less than $1,000 to $2,800 and include cruise and touring models for more gentle use. The $2,799 M Carbon Racer in black and red -- the ""M"" signifies BMW's Motorsport division -- is meant for more demanding use. The bike weighs just 16.3 pounds and has a full-carbon frame, a Shimano Ultegra 20-speed derailleur system and sizes of 21, 22 and 24 inches. There's a sassy children's bike as well, for $353. LAMBORGHINI The Impec Lamborghini 50th Anniversary Edition, built by the Swiss company BMC, costs about $32,000. Incredibly sexy, the bike is loaded with carbon-fiber components and suede-covered handlebars and saddle. Only 50 will be offered on a build-to-order basis. MINI For $548, a bike built by Dahon, which has been producing folding bicycles for about 25 years, collapses to fit in the trunks of Mini cars. The contraption is fairly light, at about 24 pounds, with an 8-speed shift system and 20-inch wheels. PORSCHE The sports car company offers RS (Racing Sport) and S (Sport) models. With a sleek style inspired by the 911 sports car, the RS is the pro model at $8,000. Constructed with carbon fiber -- it weighs less than 20 pounds -- it has a 20-speed Shimano gear system and custom pedals. The $4,500 S, framed in aluminum and offering 11 gears, is slightly heavier and comes in three sizes. Although the pair of Porsche-branded bikes released last year are built by the German bike maker ADP, they were designed in a Porsche studio in Austria ""to incorporate the Porsche genes of weight and styling,"" according to Adam Miller, product manager in North America for Porsche's Drivers Selection goods.","Some of the most advanced premium bicycles are designed by, or sold by, automobile companies, including Ferrari, Porsche, BMW and Aston Martin.",85014073-8d86-59e5-bf88-df0a96849893,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/30/automobiles/Bike/Bike-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=354&w=600&s=29c562c6a7671c820236a51d523ba7fd6e52b148fb5f3f863dc3e60ce2c80c3c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"HOT WHEELS The BMW M Carbon Racer, priced at $2,799, wears the ""M"" logo of the German automaker's high-performance division.",85014073-8d86-59e5-bf88-df0a96849893,N24News/imgs/85014073-8d86-59e5-bf88-df0a96849893.jpg,23
Music,"Nello Santi, Conductor With His Heart in Italian Opera, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/06/arts/music/nello-santi-dead.html,"Nello Santi, who excelled as an interpreter of the operas of Verdi and Puccini, conducted Verdi's ""Rigoletto"" on the Great Lawn of Central Park in 2000.





Nello Santi, a conductor who was one of the most authoritative interpreters of Italian opera, especially the works of Giuseppe Verdi, and a podium favorite of singers and orchestra players, died on Thursday at his home in Zurich. He was 88. His death was confirmed by his manager, Robert Lombardo, who said Mr. Santi had been treated for a blood infection. In the podium Mr. Santi upheld a traditionalist approach that called for close adherence to the score and a gentle but firm insistence that singers avoid exaggerated flights of coloratura and prolonged showstopping high notes. At his best, he achieved great clarity from his musicians, conducting scores with insight and a deep understanding of voices. Orchestras under his direction rarely drowned out singers, even those with lighter voices.

Cutting a portly figure and wielding a vigorous baton, Mr. Santi was a favorite of audiences at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where he led close to 400 performances from 1962 to 2000, overwhelmingly of operas by Puccini and Verdi. Musicians and singers referred to him affectionately as ""Papa Santi"" and complained that New York critics underrated him. While the critics rarely disparaged Mr. Santi outright, they could damn his performances with faint praise, using words and phrases like ""traditional and serviceable,"" ""capable"" or ""always in control."" The critic Will Crutchfield of The New York Times once recalled being asked by the famed baritone Sherrill Milnes, ""Are you the one who finally gave Nello Santi a good review?"" Reviews of Mr. Santi improved markedly in his later appearances at the Met, as appreciation grew for his loyalty to the old ways. ""Only recently,"" Mr. Crutchfield wrote in 1988, ""now that capable, secure and idiomatic conducting of the standard Italian repertory is no longer to be taken for granted, have some observers begun to be curious about what goes into it.""

Nello Santi was born on Sept. 22, 1931, in Adria, a small town south of Venice, to Giovanni and Alfonsina (Fonso) Santi. His father was a grocer, and his mother was an elementary-school teacher with a passion for classical music. When Nello was 3, she took him to a performance of Verdi's ""Rigoletto."" Thunderstruck, he had his parents replay a recording of the opera many times on their phonograph while he waved his arms about, as if conducting the orchestra.

As a child, Nello took piano lessons and learned to play the violin, viola and several wind instruments as well. He studied composition at the conservatory in Padua, and in 1951 he made his debut as conductor at Padua's Teatro Verdi. ""Naturally, it was with 'Rigoletto,'"" Mr. Santi told the Milan daily newspaper Corriere della Sera a half-century later. As a young man at the Teatro Verdi, he followed the usual apprenticeship in provincial Italy of that era. ""At the beginning I did everything,"" he told The Times in 1988. ""I was a prompter, chorus master. I accompanied singers' concerts. I even played the anvil onstage in ""Il Trovatore"" dressed as a Gypsy."" Mr. Santi married Gabrielle Faeh in Zurich in 1959. She survives him, along with their twin sons, Gian Aldo and Gian Carlo; their daughter, Rosita Santi, a soprano; a sister, Rosanna Mori; and four grandchildren. From Padua, Mr. Santi went on to conduct in West Germany, Austria, Britain, the United States and Switzerland, where he was music director of the Zurich Opera House from 1958 to 1969. He continued to conduct there for another four decades.

Mr. Santi did not limit himself to Italian composers. He once claimed that Richard Wagner was one of ""the cults of my life."" But he reserved his greatest affection for Verdi. He could recall the most minute details of Verdi operas, citing phrases and chords that the composer often repeated with slight variations in his many works. ""I love all of Verdi,"" Mr. Santi said. ""But when he composed 'Rigoletto,' 'Il Trovatore' and 'La Traviata,' he was in a profound state of grace.""

As a traditionalist, Mr. Santi identified with Arturo Toscanini's style of conducting Italian operas, especially his approach to bel canto. Like Toscanini, he tried to strike a balance with singers, allowing them to shape phrases without taking excessive liberties. Thus, a duet from ""La Traviata"" conducted by Toscanini could last a minute less than the same duet in a performance led by later conductors who gave the soprano and tenor freer rein. Mr. Santi embraced the older, more restrained and less popular approach. He frequently bemoaned what he considered Italy's diminished role in the opera world, citing a decline in music schools, especially in the provinces, and a sharp reduction in the broadcast of classical music and opera. Because Italian conductors no longer served long apprenticeships covering every aspect of opera performances, he asserted, they had become too focused on the orchestra. ""Conductors today do not love song and they do not understand theater,"" he said. Singers responded enthusiastically to Mr. Santi's direction. Placido Domingo, who recorded often with Mr. Santi and made frequent stage appearances under his direction, repeatedly praised him in interviews.","Mr. Santi, who led hundreds of performances at the Metropolitan Opera, was a renowned interpreter of Puccini and, especially, Verdi.",453500c0-4e7d-5e61-ae71-144d4fef6d35,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/07/obituaries/06Santi1-print/06Santi1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c1fd71880a79eec8d8e5ea231c79d7eb55887732ba9c2a81a2b4495bd856be90&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nello Santi, who excelled as an interpreter of the operas of Verdi and Puccini, conducted Verdi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Rigoletto&rdquo; on the Great Lawn of Central Park in 2000.",453500c0-4e7d-5e61-ae71-144d4fef6d35,N24News/imgs/453500c0-4e7d-5e61-ae71-144d4fef6d35.jpg,12
Food,A Festival Where Refugees Cook for New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/dining/refugee-food-festival.html,"On Wednesday afternoon, in a basement kitchen in the NoLIta neighborhood of Manhattan, a cheerful woman in blue sneakers and pink-striped leggings chopped piles of parsley and mint leaves, making quick work of it with her 12-inch chef's knife. Rings on, hair up, she was testing a new Iranian-style falafel sandwich for the menu of Taim restaurant. ""In Iran, we eat falafel with torshi,"" she said, opening a jar of tart, pureed pickles she had made by cooking eggplant with vinegar and dried mint. The cook, who would share only her first name, Nasrin, for fear of endangering her family still in Iran, is a refugee in the United States. She left Tehran in 2014, heading for Turkey, worried for the safety of her three children. The four of them have been living in Queens since the fall of 2016. On Thursday and Saturday, Nasrin, 43, will cook in two New York restaurants for the Refugee Food Festival, founded by French citizens, and developed by the nonprofit group Food Sweet Food, in collaboration with UNHCR, the United Nations Refugee Agency.

The festival, which started in Paris in 2016 to help change the perceptions of refugees in France and to bring people together around the dinner table, is now celebrated around World Refugee Day (June 20) as a series of meals cooked by 100 refugees in 14 cities around the world, including Amsterdam, Cape Town and San Francisco. The 100 participating restaurants cover the costs of ingredients for these meals, pay the chefs for their work and donate a part of the profits to the local refugee organization of their choice. Taim is donating $1 for every one of Nasrin's sandwiches. In New York, the consultant Celine Karout has helped to organize three events: Nasrin's falafel sandwich is on sale at the NoLIta location of Taim on Thursday, June 14. Nasrin will also cook a more complex, multicourse Iranian dinner at Le Coq Rico on Saturday. Diaa Alhanoun, from Damascus, will cook a Syrian dinner at Porsena on Sunday. Mr. Alhanoun, who has been cooking since he was 15, arrived in the United States a year and a half ago. He spent four years in Jordan as a refugee after fleeing the war in Syria.

Before she was displaced, Nasrin worked for several years as the chef of an upscale gym back in Tehran, cooking traditional Iranian fare like rich eggplant dips and saucy meatballs filled with hard-boiled egg and apricot, and serving it all poolside. ""People were going to the gym to get skinny, but the food I made didn't make them very skinny,"" she said with a laugh. Nasrin had learned to cook when she was still in middle school, in her mother's kitchen -- a huge space with two ovens, a gas range and a large refrigerator, overlooking grapevines in the yard. She was taught to make falafel by her cousin's husband, who ran a restaurant in the south of Iran, and she now adds black and white pepper to the basic mix, along with a mix of dried spices including coriander, fenugreek, turmeric and ginger. In the United States, Nasrin missed cooking professionally until last March, right around Nowruz, the Persian new year, when she started a new job at Eat Offbeat. There, 25 refugees, most of them women, work as catering chefs, producing the traditional dishes of their home countries from a commissary kitchen in Long Island City, Queens. One of Nasrin's favorite dishes to make, and to eat, has always been fesenjan, a classic Iranian stew cooked down with pomegranate seeds and walnuts, which she bases on the version her mother used to make. Nasrin plans to cook it with chicken at Le Coq Rico, a high-end French restaurant that specializes in poultry. She isn't intimidated, only excited: On the menu, she pulled together several well-known dishes, along with a few that she considered surprises. Bastani sonnati, a frozen dessert she made with cream and slivered pistachios, and perfumed with rose water and saffron, is one of two sweets she is planning; she said she rarely sees it in the United States. The other is a tender, syrup-soaked cake, served as a little petit four in a delicate paper wrapper.","This week, refugee chefs take the helm at local restaurants to celebrate their foods and cultures, in an effort that started in Paris and has spread to 13 more cities.",b13bbf91-4942-5b94-85e0-75e6fd04ba44,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/15/dining/15refugee/14refugee-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a88b5c8f7580f96fbda9f0a4211a1b323b20ea4c36d0ac67630a17188102bd18&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nasrin, a refugee from Iran who lives in Queens, preparing falafel in the basement kitchen of Taim in NoLIta.",b13bbf91-4942-5b94-85e0-75e6fd04ba44,N24News/imgs/b13bbf91-4942-5b94-85e0-75e6fd04ba44.jpg,17
Food,"The Lightest, Brothiest Soup for When You Can't Eat Another Bite",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/dining/tofu-soup-alison-roman.html,"Even a person as enthusiastic as I am about home cooking can feel fatigue, and six going on seven weeks of this quarantine, I am feeling it.

Thin slices of Gouda, forkfuls of last night's dinner from a plastic container, a pickle spear from the jar, buttered crackers or matzo with a few anchovies scattered over: These days, I am eating with a frequency that can only be described as ""constantly."" Which, for the record, I am very happy with.

Come 6:30 or 7 p.m., I am definitely not full, but I'm also maybe a little exhausted by the idea of eating again.

Media,Hannity Fans Destroy Keurig Coffee Makers After Company Pulls Advertising,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/business/media/keurig-hannity.html,"""Liberals are offended by this video of a Keurig being thrown off of a building. Please retweet to offend a liberal."" That tweet, which was posted with a video of a Keurig Green Mountain coffee maker being dropped from the second story of an apartment building, was one of many sent over the weekend with the hashtag #boycottkeurig.

The story begins, as you might have expected, with Sean Hannity. On Thursday, the Fox News host spoke about the allegations against Roy Moore, the Alabama senate candidate who, The Washington Post had reported that day, made sexual advances toward teenage girls when he was in his early 30s, including a 14-year-old. Mr. Hannity, describing those actions on his radio show while speaking with a co-host, Lynda McLaughlin, seemed to justify Mr. Moore's reported conduct by calling one of the encounters ""consensual."" Later, on his television show, Mr. Hannity said that the statement ""was absolutely wrong"" and that he ""misspoke."" He then brought up the possibility of accusers lying for money, or for political purposes. On Friday, Angelo Carusone, the president of Media Matters for America, the partisan watchdog organization that has campaigned against Mr. Hannity since at least May, began to criticize advertisers for sponsoring his show in light of his comments about Mr. Moore.

Keurig did not immediately respond to a question about whether it would reconsider advertising on the program. But in an email to employees, the company's chief executive, Bob Gamgort, said that its acknowledgment that it had pulled the ad was not standard practice and constituted ""an unacceptable situation.""
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation. The email, which was obtained by The Washington Post and confirmed as valid by a company spokeswoman, Katie Gilroy, said that the tweet ""gave the appearance of 'taking sides' in an emotionally charged debate that escalated on Twitter and beyond over the weekend, which was not our intent."" ""Our company and brand reputations are too valuable to be put at risk in this manner,"" it said. It was difficult to measure the scale of the anti-Keurig counterprotest; even when a topic begins to trend, the tweets are often spread and amplified by bots and other politically motivated accounts. But the calls for a boycott underscored the difficulties American companies face in a hyperpartisan era where any sort of political stance can set off online protests.

Health,AstraZeneca Partly Resumes Coronavirus Vaccine Trial After Halting It for Safety,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/12/health/astrazeneca-coronavirus-vaccine-trial-resumes.html,"The pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca said Saturday that it had resumed its coronavirus vaccine trial in Britain after suspending it six days ago over potential safety issues but that its trials in the United States and other countries were still on hold. The news came the same day that a competitor, Pfizer, said it was expanding the trial of its coronavirus vaccine to 44,000 people -- a big increase from its previous goal of 30,000 -- in an effort to recruit a more diverse group of participants and potentially cut down the time needed to get results from the trial. Together, the developments raised new questions about when a vaccine might be available and showed just how unpredictable vaccine development can be, even as the world is desperately waiting for something that can bring an end to the pandemic. Both companies' announcements lacked crucial details, prompting criticism that they were not being open enough about the data they're collecting. AstraZeneca did not offer any information to support the decision to partially resume trials and would not give any details about the illness of a patient that had led to the suspension. Pfizer did not explain how it would determine the effectiveness of the vaccine in its expanded trials.

Dr. Eric Topol, a professor of molecular medicine at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego and an expert on clinical trials, found both announcements worrisome, contending that the companies were withholding crucial information. ""The public has a right to know what's going on,"" he said. ""The future depends on it."" AstraZeneca and Pfizer are among the three companies that are currently testing their candidates in late-stage clinical trials in the United States -- Moderna is the third -- in a record-setting race to develop a coronavirus vaccine. All three have said they expect to have a vaccine ready -- at least for high-priority groups -- before the end of the year. On Saturday, Pfizer repeated previous statements that it could have an answer about whether its vaccine works by the end of October. All three have also reached deals with the United States government worth billions of dollars, either for support of their research or to provide a supply of their vaccines should they prove safe and effective. [Follow the push for a coronavirus vaccine with The Times's vaccine tracker.] The fast-paced hunt for a vaccine has come under scrutiny because President Trump has increasingly pushed for one to be ready before the election on Nov. 3, leading to worries that he is politicizing the process. The concern has prompted the companies to make extraordinary pledges to follow the science, as have top federal regulators. Americans have shown reluctance to take a vaccine they view as having been rushed, placing added pressure on the companies to show that they are acting appropriately. In late-stage trials, known as Phase 3, vaccine developers typically enlist tens of thousands of volunteers. Half of the participants receive a placebo, and half receive the vaccine. Researchers monitor the participants closely for side effects.

Last Sunday, AstraZeneca suspended its trial after a participant in Britain became seriously ill. The company did not announce the decision. On Wednesday, after the news organization Stat reported that the trial had paused, AstraZeneca released a statement that described it only as a ""potentially unexplained illness."" The New York Times reported that a person familiar with the situation, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, had said that the symptoms were consistent with inflammation of the spinal cord, known as transverse myelitis. The condition can be treated and is typically resolved in a few months, but severe attacks can cause major disabilities. In announcing that it had resumed the trial in Britain on Saturday, AstraZeneca said that an outside panel of experts had reviewed the case and had told the British government's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Authority that the trials could be safely resumed. The authority agreed, giving the green light to start again. ""Good news for everyone: The Oxford vaccine trials are back up and running,"" he said. ""This pause shows we will always put safety first. We will back our scientists to deliver an effective vaccine as soon as safely possible.""
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. Michele Meixell, a spokeswoman for AstraZeneca, said that the company could not disclose any further medical information about the sick volunteer. ""All trial investigators and participants will be updated with the relevant information and disclosed on global clinical registries, according to the clinical trial and regulatory standards,"" she said in an email. Ms. Meixell did not say when she expected the trials in other countries to restart. ""AstraZeneca will continue to work with health authorities across the world and be guided as to when other clinical trials can resume,"" she said.

Ms. Meixell said the company did not anticipate that the pauses would create a delay in getting results from the trial before the end of the year. Stephanie Cacommo, media relations director for the Food and Drug Administration, declined to comment on the status of AstraZeneca's trial in the United States. ""The FDA cannot comment, confirm or deny product applications, including questions about products under investigation,"" she said in an email. Dr. Topol, who has run clinical trials for heart treatments, said it was routine for them to be put on hold and then resumed. But AstraZeneca and Oxford's public statement about why the trial is going forward only in Britain left him baffled. ""Why would it go forward in one country?"" he said. ""We're all people. That's peculiar.""

So far, Pfizer and its partner BioNTech have not reported any symptoms in their participants that would require a pause in their trial. In a statement on Saturday, Pfizer said the company expected to reach its initial target of 30,000 volunteers next week. The company said it had requested F.D.A. approval to expand the trial to 44,000 participants so that it could include more people with diseases such as H.I.V. and hepatitis B and C. The company is also expanding its criteria to include people as young as 16.

Amy Rose, a spokeswoman for Pfizer, said that the additional volunteers might be recruited in any of the countries where trials are taking place, including Argentina and Brazil. ""We will continue to actively recruit all eligible individuals where the incidence and spread of COVID-19 cases is greatest,"" she said in an email. She also said that a bigger trial might allow Pfizer to get those results sooner. ""Enrolling more participants gives us greater flexibility and allows us to potentially reach the number of cases needed to complete the study faster,"" she said. Dr. Topol said he found it unlikely that Pfizer could get full results from a 44,000-person trial by the end of October, given that the vaccine requires two doses separated by three weeks. It was possible, he said, that Pfizer intended to look at the early results of the trial to see how effective the vaccine was. An outside committee of experts can evaluate clinical trials at different points in the study. The panel could advise the company to stop the trial if it showed overwhelming efficacy, if it failed to prevent cases of Covid-19 or if there were serious safety concerns. Pfizer has not said when those so-called interim analyses would take place or what the criteria are for stopping the trials. ""We are not going to speak to timing or specifics of any interim analyses,"" said Ms. Rose, the Pfizer spokeswoman. Dr. Topol warned that because Pfizer has reiterated its goal of getting results by October even as it is recruiting new participants, ""What we see here from this Pfizer news release is that they fully intend to interrupt the trial."" On Tuesday, Pfizer and eight other companies that are developing coronavirus vaccines signed a pledge that they would wait to put forward a vaccine until the evidence for safety and efficacy was clear. ""We are committed to running our trial with scientific excellence and integrity,"" Ms. Rose said.","The company said tests of its vaccine would start up again in Britain while remaining suspended in the U.S. and other countries. Pfizer, a competitor, announced an expansion of its trials.",ffb6bf30-634a-547a-8983-199d43e4128a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/12/science/12Virus-trials-az/12Virus-trials-az-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ad9c1a0065e83380d3685b21abfff128e3b5caf942749313632aae2a6f55f357&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,AstraZeneca offered no explanation for its decision to restart its coronavirus trial in Britain.,ffb6bf30-634a-547a-8983-199d43e4128a,N24News/imgs/ffb6bf30-634a-547a-8983-199d43e4128a.jpg,1
Theater,Dinner Is No Longer Served: Theater That Built Careers Is Gone,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/theater/westchester-broadway-theatre-closed.html,"It was a closing night at the Westchester Broadway Theater unlike any other. The theater marquee still read ""All Shook Up."" But the stage was stripped, except for piles of lights, and the audience was sparse -- 100 or so, many of them former actors, crew members and fans. They carted off spotlights, posters, tablecloths and printers at a sale last week that lasted more than 10 hours. Everything had to go. Bill Bateman, who had appeared in 10 shows at the 46-year-old dinner theater, came from Manhattan to reminisce, joining others at what was at once a family reunion and a funeral. ""I wanted to say thank you,"" he said later. ""This was a great place to work for so many years. You got to do what you loved, all while getting to earn health insurance, pay your rent and sleep in your own bed at night. It's a very sad day."" This was not the happy ending that typically filled the theater's stages, where musicals from ""Show Boat"" to ""42nd Street"" to ""Newsies"" had entertained grandparents and grandchildren alike.

And, after a blunt auction announcement that proclaimed a sale ""to the bare walls,"" there is no hope for a revival. The space would be gutted and turned into a warehouse. Bill Stutler, one of the theater's two co-founders, once dreamed of being a movie director. A colleague remembers him fondly recalling a dinner theater excursion while visiting his parents back in West Virginia one Christmas. After being fired from his job as an advertising executive, he decided to open his own venue in Elmsford, a northern suburb of New York City, that would combine food and entertainment at a price not just stockbrokers could afford. Never mind that in 1974 the country was in the middle of a recession, at the time the most severe since World War II. Or that start-up costs would run at least $400,000. Or that locals would try to shutter the theater before it got off the ground because they feared Stutler was building a strip club (William Hammerstein, the son of the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein II, helped set them straight when he joined the theater's board).

Together with his friend Robert J. Funking, a chef, he built An Evening Dinner Theater -- later renamed the Westchester Broadway Theater -- an institution that would not just survive, but thrive, employing thousands of actors, waiters, stagehands and producers across more than 200 musicals and plays, generating as much as $8 million in annual revenue. It became the longest-running year-round theater in New York to employ members of Actors' Equity Association, the labor union that represents 51,000 theater actors and stage managers. Rob Marshall, who went on to direct the Oscar-winning film adaptation of ""Chicago,"" worked there. So did Estelle Harris (""Seinfeld"") and Will Swenson (""Hair""). Nights without shows featured comedians like Wanda Sykes and Lewis Black early in their careers. But then came a pandemic -- and a state-mandated closure in March. In a note to customers announcing the initial shutdown, Funking and Stutler promised ticketholders a credit for a future performance and a free drink, anticipating a time when ""together we'll all toast a return to normalcy."" But it became clear that normalcy would not return any time soon. ""We cannot be a profitable business while being closed and it looks dim for any live theater to be open for the foreseeable future,"" the three owners, Stutler, Funking and Stutler's wife, Von Ann, wrote in a Nov. 3 email to patrons announcing the permanent closing. Dinner theaters would be among the last venues to reopen, they reasoned. With their landlord, Robert Martin Company, unwilling to postpone payments on their lease and employees who had not been paid since March, they said they had no choice but to hang it up. All three owners declined to be interviewed; Funking retired in January. A spokesman for Robert Martin Company, which took over the theater's lease about a year ago, said the venue's financial struggles predated the pandemic. According to Pia Haas, the theater's former director of press and public relations, Stutler had already been searching for a successor, and had an offer from Todd Gershwin, the Broadway producer and great-nephew of George and Ira Gershwin. (Haas provided information about the theater's history, but said she was not speaking on the owners' behalf.)

Every American theater is suffering, but dinner theaters face a particularly grim prognosis. The Westchester Broadway Theater was among the last dozen dinner theaters in the country to employ union actors. But Denise Trupe, the president of the National Dinner Theater Association, an organization of 22 professional venues formed in 1978, still said she was surprised to hear of the closure. While there are fewer dinner theaters now than during the 1970s peak, the dozens that remain tend to have loyal subscriber bases. Though many of the Westchester theater's former stars had lost touch with the institution, the response to its closing was surprise -- and sadness. Stroman choreographed ""Gypsy"" and ""Sugar Babies"" at the theater in the late 1980s, before going on to a career that includes five Tonys, for ""The Producers"" and other shows. She said that the generosity of Stutler and Funking sticks with her nearly four decades later. ""They were so open to giving me that chance back when I was a young choreographer with no name and no credits,"" she said. ""I'm forever grateful.""

Swenson made his Westchester debut in the title role of the theater's 2001 production of ""Jekyll & Hyde."" He played the part at matinees, his first professional acting job after more than six months of auditions. ""It was such a load off,"" he said. ""I got insurance, and a paycheck every week, which helped me not feel like a failure."" Actors who worked there say the place was more than a steppingstone. It served as an artistic home for actors with Broadway credits who wanted to work without leaving town, enabling them to earn their Equity cards and qualify for health insurance. Robert Cuccioli, who made his Westchester debut in Maury Yeston and Arthur Kopit's ""Phantom,"" said the family environment was one reason he continued to work there throughout a career that has brought him to Broadway often. Stutler and Funking, he said, were unswervingly loyal, delaying that production of ""Phantom"" for a month after he broke his foot in previews. ""The fact that they waited for me to get well before they opened meant a lot,"" he said. ""They treated me like a son or a brother. It was very special.""

Steve Calleran, the 72-year-old M.C. and evening manager, worked at the theater for nearly 35 years. He met his wife there in 1975, and his two daughters worked there as waitresses. In the note announcing the closing, the owners estimated that more than six million audience members had attended shows, nearly 200 of whom wrote fond farewell messages on the theater's Facebook page. Patricia McDyer Smyth, a Westchester resident who had seen at least three shows a year for the past decade, fondly recalls organizing an outing to see ""Saturday Night Fever"" with 42 of her country-line-dancing friends. But she was disappointed that the theater did not offer refunds when it closed. She had purchased 20 tickets for shows in the upcoming season, leaving her out $1,400. ""I am also struggling during this pandemic,"" she said. ""I need that money back."" (White Plains Performing Arts Center, another Equity theater, will allow customers to exchange tickets for shows there once it reopens.) But Calleran, who is now out of work for the first time in decades, does not blame Stutler and Funking for the closure. ""I know they would have stuck it out for as long as they could have,"" he said. And Cuccioli said he feared the theater was only the first domino to fall. ""I know other theaters are struggling,"" he said. ""I just hope something can be done to stop the bleeding.""",The Westchester Broadway Theater was one of the last remaining professional dinner theaters in the country.,495c36d6-9c3a-5a43-9f07-1f116e198b82,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/24/arts/22westchester-7/22westchester-7-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,"Steve Calleran, who worked at the Westchester Broadway Theater for 35 years until the shutdown, getting the crowd ready for ""The Producers"" in 2008.",495c36d6-9c3a-5a43-9f07-1f116e198b82,N24News/imgs/495c36d6-9c3a-5a43-9f07-1f116e198b82.jpg,10

Books,Your Book Editor Just Snagged Your Spot on the Best-Seller List,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/books/aj-finn-the-woman-in-the-window-daniel-mallory.html,"Four years ago, when former book editor Daniel Mallory purchased his 550-square foot Chelsea apartment, its main draw was the book storage: floor-to-ceiling shelving, which covers a wall of his living room, plus numerous nooks above doorways and under the flat screen TV that shares space among the shelves. Recently, after receiving 32 hardback copies of his debut novel, ""The Woman in the Window,"" published under the pseudonym A. J. Finn, Mr. Mallory had to decide which of his collection would be relegated to storage. In the end, the Evelyn Waugh, Graham Greene and Henry James novels got the heave-ho. ""They're dead,"" he said of his early literary idols. ""They're not going to complain."" Last week, ""The Woman in the Window,"" a psychological thriller that pays homage to Hitchcock classics, debuted at No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. It is a happy if unsurprising endnote to the book's publishing saga, which began in the fall of 2016, when word got out that the debut thriller at the center of an eight-house bidding war was written by an anonymous book editor. Probably because of the gender-neutral pseudonym and the book's winning, wine-slugging unreliable narrator, Anna Fox, guesses about the author's identity skewed female. The competition for North American rights ended with a $2 million, two-book winning offer from Mr. Mallory's own publishing house, William Morrow, plus deals with a record-breaking 37 international publishers and a film deal with Fox 2000. ""As a publishing industry veteran, I could appreciate, even at this very early stage, how unusual this sort of attention was,"" Mr. Mallory said.

Even William Morrow's acquiring editor, Jennifer Brehl, didn't know the author's identity when she received the manuscript. Having read most of the book in one sitting, it was only when Ms. Brehl pitched it to William Morrow publisher Liate Stehlik, that she learned it had been written by their own colleague, Mr. Mallory, then the vice president and executive editor of William Morrow. Despite Ms. Brehl's friendship with Mr. Mallory, she was shocked. ""I had no idea that he was writing a book,"" she said. Had Mr. Mallory not prudently scheduled a weeklong trip to Palm Springs, which began the day his agent sent the manuscript to publishers, Ms. Brehl imagines she may have walked the book into his office to ask for his thoughts on it. Mr. Mallory had always planned to submit the manuscript under a pseudonym, which is a mash-up of his cousin's name, Alice Jane, plus the name of another family member's French bulldog.

""I felt it would be disconcerting for my authors to wander into a bookshop and see their editor's name writ large across a hardback,"" he said. While editors moonlighting as authors isn't the norm, Mr. Mallory's crossover is not entirely unique. The novelist David Ebershoff had been working as an editor at Random House two years when his first book, ""The Danish Girl,"" was published in 2000. Former children's book editor Tui Sutherland has published numerous books under her own name as well as multiple pseudonyms, including Tamara Summers, Heather Williams and Rob Kidd. Other recent author/editors of note include former Simon & Schuster editor Greer Hendricks (""The Wife Between Us,"" coauthored with Sarah Pekkanen), Scribner editor in chief Colin Harrison (""You Belong to Me""), former Riverhead assistant editor Danya Kukafka (""Girl in Snow""), Random House senior editor Anna Pitoniak (""The Futures"") and Henry Holt senior editor Caroline Zancan (""Local Girls"").

But none generated buzz on par with ""The Woman in the Window"" which, following its sale, collected blurbs from such authors as Gillian Flynn, who called it ""a noir for the new millennium,"" and Stephen King, who deemed it ""one of those rare books that really is unputdownable."" What impressed Mr. King most was the seamless integration of classic films such as ""Vertigo,"" ""Rear Window"" and ""Gaslight."" Mr. Mallory, who is 38, has had a near lifelong fascination with psychological thrillers that began when his parents dropped him off at an art house cinema for the afternoon. The film playing was Dutch director and producer George Sluizer's ""The Vanishing,"" which Stanley Kubrick once called ""the most horrifying film I've ever seen."" Mr. Mallory said he was terrified, but ""I was unable to prize my eyes from the screen."" The dueling emotions ""interested and sort of disturbed me even at that age."" As a teenager, he discovered Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" which proved a gateway drug to the rest of Hitchcock's oeuvre, along with film noir and suspense novels like Patricia Highsmith's Tom Ripley series. He majored in literature at Duke University, and went on to pursue a master's and doctorate at Oxford. There, he wrote about transgressive sexuality in the works of Highsmith, Graham Greene and Henry James, whose novel ""The Turn of the Screw,"" with its own unreliable narrator, Mr. Mallory considers the original psychological thriller.

For several years, Mr. Mallory lived in London and worked at the commercial publishing imprint Sphere, of Little, Brown UK, before returning to New York to spearhead a crime and thriller digital first initiative at William Morrow. While he had long considered writing fiction, it was only when he clocked the popularity of ""Gone Girl"" and ""Girl on the Train,"" two commercially successful descendants of the classic genre he'd long loved, that he realized the market was ripe for the kind of story he might want to tell. But while his publisher's eye for a successful trend may have primed him for the idea, the novel's premise was deeply personal. The idea came to Mr. Mallory one night as he sat on his couch watching an old favorite, Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a lamp switch on in the apartment across the street. ""It occurred to me, 'Oh, how funny, in 1954 Jimmy Stewart is spying on his neighbor, and in 2015, I'm doing the same thing,' "" he said. ""Voyeurism dies hard."" At the time, after struggling for a decade and a half with severe depression, Mr. Mallory had recently been diagnosed with bipolar II disorder, and was in his third week of almost total isolation as he transitioned from one medication to another. ""I thought, too, as I was watching the woman across the street, about how, despite living in one of the most populous cities in the world, I felt quite lonely,"" he said. Over the next two days, Mr. Mallory wrote a 7,500-word outline for a novel about a former child therapist who, trapped in her Harlem townhouse by her crippling agoraphobia, becomes obsessed with the family that moves into the building opposite her own. Once finished, Mr. Mallory sent the outline to his friend Jennifer Joel, a partner and literary agent at ICM, who encouraged him to pursue the project.","Daniel Mallory submitted ""The Woman in the Window,"" a psychological thriller, under a pseudonym.

Style,Prom Season Is Almost Over,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/11/style/prom-new-york-institute-for-special-education-bronx.html,"Ramil Hirsawa posing for a portrait on the campus of the New York Institute for Special Education before the prom on Thursday, June 6.





Last Thursday, as the afternoon sun beat down on the Bronx campus of the New York Institute for Special Education, students readied themselves for an annual rite of passage: the prom. ""I don't remember exactly what color it is, but I like this dress,"" Nathalie Wood, 18, said, sitting on a bench outside one of the dorms. As she spoke, the high school junior felt the lace on the bodice of her dress, then gathered the tulle of the skirt in her hand. ""My mom hemmed the dress because it was way too long. And she made this corsage with the leftover material from the dress,"" she said. Founded in 1831, NYISE serves students with visual impairment as well as those with emotional or learning needs. Thirteen buildings, some with stately columns, are situated on the expansive 17-acre campus.

Teenagers in button-downs, suits and gowns held onto each other's arms as they walked. Two at a time, they met outside the dorms. In the warm afternoon light, sequins glittered. Nathalie had searched long and hard for a dress that would make her look glamorous. ""You know, like those super grown-up ladies that you see in those classic movies wearing the long evening gown? I don't know how they have their hair, but I guess it's like mine,"" she said, touching the rhinestone barrettes in her dark curls. Out in the yard, roughly 30 attendees had gathered. From the crowd, a boy walked up the stairs and stood leaning against the porch railing nearby. He listened as Nathalie explained that some students go with dates and some go as friends. ""They assign us tables to sit at,"" she said.

A little after 5:30 p.m. Nathalie posed alone, but Moises Mercedes, 18, was just outside the frame, trying to make her laugh. He is a fixture of the school's prom, which he has attended annually since 8th grade. ""There's this sort of magic about the prom that keeps impressing me every year,"" Moises said. ""Since it's my second-to-last prom it seems like I need to appreciate it a little more.""

Nathalie held onto his arm as he led her toward the porch. Many students were holding onto each other, sometimes out of necessity and sometimes, it seemed, less so. Iliana Mejia, 15, had her arm around her date's waist. Jayden Higgs, 16, was wearing a red satin vest and a black dress shirt . His hair was dyed red. Iliana wore a black dress and a red sweater. ""We've been dating for two weeks,"" Iliana said. ""May 22, so two weeks."" When asked if the upcoming prom night factored into their decision to get together just then, Iliana said no. ""You know, we were in two different places in life but we just converged to the same place. We had to sort some things out before we got together. Then I asked him out and he said yes.""

At an event room at Pine, the restaurant and host for the night, the theme was New York City. Pitchers of soda were brought to the tables by waiters in bow ties. Students tucked their white canes under the tables. Before dinner, a D.J. brought everyone onto the dance floor. ""Alright!"" he shouted. ""Yes! Put your hands up!"" David Baez, who coaches some of the school's athletic teams, spent the night running from student to student. For him, prom is bittersweet. ""It's their night to be who they want to be,"" he said. ""It's our chance to say goodbye."" Throughout the night, it seemed like many of the typical high school embarrassments had been solved. Plenty of dancers danced alone. It was a staff member who stepped in and turned Nathalie, who was dancing alone in a corner, toward the crowd. She seemed momentarily confused by the adjustment but quickly resumed dancing, a broad smile on her face. When Moises found her, he took her hands and spun her around.

After a dinner of multiple pastas, the prom royalty was crowned, as nominated by the staff. First, two princes and two princesses, then a drumroll for king and queen and an explosion when the names were called. Cameras flashed. The tiaras and sashes were put in place. The dance floor, in an instant, was full again. Outside, Nathalie and Moises walked to the terrace at the other end of the building to have another picture taken. ""I can't hear anything!"" Nathalie said, beaming. ""My ears are ringing!"" Moises screamed. By the terrace, another school's prom was underway. Those students posed for pictures as well, using the blue and gold sunset as their backdrop. A group of them cut through the terrace and slipped between the NYISE students and the photographer. ""Congratulations, guys,"" one said as he ducked under the camera. ""You made it."" Back inside, Nathalie and Moises joined the crowd. The music thumped and the students grabbed each other and danced. One boy reached a hand up and pointed toward the sky.",Here's how one school in the Bronx celebrated.,f8bb4f18-fa41-52dc-b884-62ff56f504f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/11/fashion/11prom1/11prom1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4cfc659e95d8332197c65a7db55f66fe7a86e530e6d4c836cd52d65121fcc6e3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ramil Hirsawa posing for a portrait on the campus of the New York Institute for Special Education before the prom on Thursday, June 6.",f8bb4f18-fa41-52dc-b884-62ff56f504f3,N24News/imgs/f8bb4f18-fa41-52dc-b884-62ff56f504f3.jpg,15
Art & Design,Turmoil After a Museum Deletes 'Black Lives Matter' From Postings,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/arts/design/seattle-childrens-museum.html,"Staff at the Seattle Children's Museum posted this list of books that feature anti-racist messaging in May. Hours later, they found that certain parts had been deleted, like the phrase ""Black Lives Matter."" The label at the top right was added by staff.





In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and the protests that followed, institutions of every kind worked to figure out what they wanted to say. What sort of public statement should a shoe company release about racial injustice? How about a university? A theater? At the Seattle Children's Museum, staff members decided to post lists of children's books online that were anti-racist in their messaging and featured joyful stories about Black children and their families. Another social media post featured a museum program where children create their own ""support signs,"" not unlike the signs that activists bring to demonstrations, but typically softer. One declared ""I love everything,"" with drawings of heart-shaped balloons and peace signs.

All of the posts started with a declaration: Black Lives Matter. Hours after the postings on Instagram and Facebook on May 30, all mentions of the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" had been edited out of the captions. The museum's executive director explained her rationale for the deletions a couple of days later on a staff video call that participants taped. Christi Stapleton Keith, the director, said she personally believed in the message of Black Lives Matter but the institution had a process and needed to create a message ""that the museum could all agree on as an organization.""""And what happens"" she went on, ""if we lose funding? What happens if we lose donors? All of those considerations have to be considered when we write the language around this."" The deletions and the call that followed created a crisis at the children's museum that is still unraveling more than two months later. Nine employees of the museum, which had been operating online only because of the pandemic, almost immediately went on strike. ""At that moment I was prepared to never come back,"" said Maya Burton, who, at the time, worked in the museum's education department. Two weeks ago, those nine employees were laid off, though the museum said it was a preplanned layoff related to the exhaustion of its funds from the federal Paycheck Protection Program and ""in no way tied to recent developments.""

Now an outside investigator hired by the board of trustees is interviewing former and current employees as part of an inquiry into the social media incident. Ms. Stapleton Keith, who has run the museum since 2017, has been placed on paid leave until its conclusion. In an email, she declined an interview request, saying that she could not go into specifics because of the ongoing investigation. ""I do want to underscore that the Seattle Children's Museum and myself, personally, do support Black Lives Matter and have long put forth educational programming for children that supports a more diverse, inclusive and equitable society,"" she said. In a statement released after the layoffs in July, the museum sought to explain the controversy: ""Because the content dealt with sensitive topics and had been posted without typical discussion, review or approval from S.C.M. leadership, it was revised and references to Black Lives Matter were temporarily removed until a wider group of museum stakeholders could be consulted to ensure our messaging accurately represented our educational content.""

The museum, which once featured a staff of 20, is now operating with five people. It had laid off most of its workers earlier in the spring as the pandemic bore down on Seattle, and it became clear that it would be a while before children and families would converge on its vast playground of hands-on activities, like the grocery store where visitors can pick out imitation food items. During the months of the pandemic, though, the museum's Instagram account had become a virtual stand-in for its programming, filling up over the weeks with science demonstrations about wind energy and composting, or cooking programs that showed children how to make ""heart healthy chocolate pudding."" One former employee who often appeared as a host of the videos, Mimi Santos, said that it felt natural for the museum to post lists of books that dovetailed with the racial justice protests sweeping the country. The lists included titles like ""Not My Idea: A Book About Whiteness"" and ""My Hair Is a Garden,"" a picture book about a Black girl learning the beauty of natural hair. When Ms. Santos heard that Ms. Stapleton Keith did not approve of what had been posted, she said that she told her supervisor that, ""If you take it down you're telling the families that we serve and your front facing staff, who are majority people of color, you're telling us that you don't care."" By the time the staff logged onto their computers to join the Zoom call with the director in June, they had a list of demands for their bosses, among them, that Ms. Stapleton Keith make a public apology and an explanation as to why the posts were edited.

Ms. Stapleton Keith sought to explain what had happened on the call. She said that the social media posts hadn't gone through the proper processes and apologized for the ""hurt all around because of the way these posts were handled."" She told the staff that while ""I don't think any of us disagree with the language around Black Lives Matter,"" releasing such a statement required more group consultation, as well as board approval. A former employee who wrote the captions for the posts, Meg Hesketh, said that she did not realize that writing ""Black Lives Matter"" in a social media post would require a review process -- or end up causing such a stir. She said that many members of the museum staff wore pins on their vests that say Black Lives Matter. Particularly upsetting, several staff members said, was the suggestion that the tone of the postings needed to be modified so as to not upset donors. The museum says that about 40 percent of its budget, which was roughly $1.3 million in 2018, is contributed. ""My thought was that then we need to find better funding,"" Anthony Noceda, a former employee, said in an interview. ""If their values don't align with that, then we don't need their money."" Mr. Mathews, the board chair, said that the investigator had also been tasked with looking into what employees had recently identified as ongoing problems with how staffers of color were treated at the museum. He said that the board was ""taking the hurt that our community feels very seriously.""

Ms. Burton said that, even if there is a chance some staff will be hired back, she had decided not to return and headed home to Florida, where she lived before moving to Seattle to attend college in 2012. On Sunday, she was in the middle of the drive, when she reflected on the tumult of recent months. ""It's sad because I was sure that this was going to be my forever job,"" said Ms. Burton, who is Black. ""But this is about people's lives. It's about my life, the lives of my family and friends."" Since the controversy erupted in early June, the museum has used the phrase ""Black Lives Matter"" several times on its social media accounts and in its public statements. A new page on its website is called ""Because Black Lives Matter.""","The director of the Seattle Children's Museum faced a strike and an internal inquiry after she edited staff postings, citing fund-raising and other concerns.",28a8f448-79ca-5545-8da2-f805c874cb01,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/05/arts/04pulldown3/04pulldown3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bceb96adefe6b2abe98aba562a8abb66258651d5af937f26bcef739f34572487&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Staff at the Seattle Children&rsquo;s Museum posted this list of books that feature anti-racist messaging in May.

Books,The Inscrutable Mike Pence,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/27/books/review/piety-and-power-tom-lobianco.html,"PIETY AND POWER

Mike Pence and the Taking of the White House

By Tom LoBianco

After losing his first campaign for Congress, a penitent Mike Pence swore off the dark side of politics. In a confessional essay in 1991, he wrote that ""negative campaigning is wrong"" and set out rules for himself for the future. Any campaign, he said, ""ought to demonstrate the basic human decency of the candidate,"" must advance a goal greater than personal desire and should not be only ""about winning.""

A quarter-century later, he signed onto the presidential ticket of a candidate who seemed to be the antithesis of the ideal Pence once envisioned. While Pence himself maintains a public dignity and eschews vitriol against opponents in keeping with his long-ago atonement, he has tethered himself to a president who revels in negative campaigning, makes winning his all-consuming aspiration and has rarely been accused of an excess of human decency.

That Faustian bargain makes Pence one of the most intriguing yet least understood figures in American politics today. What mix of ambition, duty, principle and expedience led him to the vice presidency in the White House of Donald J. Trump? How does a devoted evangelical Christian serve a foulmouthed, thrice-married vulgarian who boasts of grabbing women by their private parts and paid hush money to a porn star alleging an extramarital affair? What virtues does Pence see in Trump? Does he genuinely admire him the way he seems to in those rapturous photo ops? Or does he secretly see himself as the last grown-up in the room, keeping things from being worse?

Tom LoBianco asks all the right questions in ""Piety & Power,"" his crisp and engaging biography of the vice president, but the answers remain elusive. As a reporter in Indiana, LoBianco covered Pence's rise for The Associated Press and Indianapolis Star. He tells us of a boy from a plain Midwestern upbringing who explored the intersection of faith and politics and became a radio host, congressman and governor. But LoBianco is left -- along with the rest of us -- to wonder at the interior life that Pence guards so zealously.","Tom LoBianco's ""Piety and Power"" tells us what there is to know about the vice president, which is far from everything.",ed12f1b2-8406-5952-ac0f-90826b610791,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/20/books/review/20Baker/00Baker-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=219b19f12c83f6b097da4a5cbe1a74fae3083ab79bf03a722149834a9ad442dd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mike Pence with his wife, Karen, at a political rally, June 2019.",ed12f1b2-8406-5952-ac0f-90826b610791,N24News/imgs/ed12f1b2-8406-5952-ac0f-90826b610791.jpg,13
Theater,Review: In Search of Intelligent Life and a Willing Sperm Donor,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/theater/review-hello-from-the-children-of-planet-earth-don-nguyen.html,"Mr. Nguyen has a fine concept and a genuine sweetness to his writing, despite a few mild gross-out moments, most courtesy of William's boorish, bro-ish, Cheetos-obsessed office mate, Freddy (Jon Hoche). But sustaining human life onstage? That's tricky, too. And the performances and dialogue don't always manage it. Here's the play's first line, delivered postcoitally: ""So ... um ... I'm sorry I screamed in your vagina.""

The characters feel like rough sketches -- a job, a few traits -- rather than people and despite a few nicely observed moments, they act in ways that have less to do with human behavior than with Mr. Nguyen setting up jokes and set pieces. One of those involves a copy of ""Little Woman"" put to prurient purpose. (Also, why does everyone wear the same clothes for four months straight?)

Still, the space-age set (designed by Kimie Nishikawa), a riot of geometric furniture, bulbs and LEDs (the lighting is by Nicole Pearce), is a treat. And when the stage realism fails, there are enjoyably surreal interludes, courtesy of a creature called the Farthest Explorer, a humanoid version of Voyager 1, who zooms through space carrying a golden record etched with greetings in dozens of languages as well as whale songs and ""Johnny B. Goode."" Played with cheery wonder by the adorable Olivia Oguma, she offers disquisitions on the universe, catastrophe and community. She also delivers the play's moral: ""These humans' deep and sometimes overzealous desire to connect to others is, well ... super cute.""","Don Nguyen's ""Hello, From the Children of Planet Earth"" asks what it takes to sustain human life, in space and on earth.",ad3a8220-8e48-5209-8d87-f4e05bf4a70a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/09/arts/09hellofromthechildren-2/08hellofromthechildren-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=044364574d392d092ec1d28526c6932d07ea7aeff6a18dc7ecb1dba782f13658&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Olivia Oguma plays a humanoid version of Voyager 1 in &ldquo;Hello, From the Children of Planet Earth.&rdquo;",ad3a8220-8e48-5209-8d87-f4e05bf4a70a,N24News/imgs/ad3a8220-8e48-5209-8d87-f4e05bf4a70a.jpg,10
Travel,A Boulder Restaurant Celebrating New-Coloradan Cuisine,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/21/travel/arcana-boulder-restaurant-colorado-review.html,"Colorado was no place to live -- at least not for the miners who'd gone looking for gold in the Front Range section of the Southern Rockies. ""The mountains were too rough and the plains looked too much like a desert,"" The Daily News of Denver wrote in 1882. ""Men came with the view of making fortunes by mining, and of returning to the States to enjoy it.""

But the land was rich with berries, trout and elk, which had fed tribes like the Arapaho and Cheyenne. Arcana, a restaurant in Boulder that opened in February 2016, is attempting to resurrect this long food narrative using almost entirely local meat and produce. The menu, now curated by Kyle Mendenhall, who started as chef in June of last year, is both new-American and new-Coloradan.

""It felt important to preserve and promote early-American food history,"" Elliott Toan, a co-owner, said. ""Culinary traditions get to the heart of human experience, and we're trying to honor different influences that came here, whether from Europe or Africa or anywhere else."" For inspiration, the team foraged for recipes at the History Colorado Center, at Boulder churches and within their own families, including the chef's great-grandmother's collection from 1911.

During a recent visit, I loved the elk carpaccio, which arrived studded with juniper custard and pickled Rainier cherries. The lamb T-bone was corralled by spring pea shoots in radicchio dressing, tasting fresh as morning dew. Dumplings made from masa (ground daily by a neighboring taco shop) were dished up with braised pork and crispy brussels sprout leaves; it was as satisfying as a classic pozole (some 21 percent of Coloradans are Latino). The tart cherry icebox pie with a thyme and rye cookie crust delivered me to my grandmother's kitchen.","The long food narrative of the state informs the whole menu at Arcana, using almost entirely local meat and produce.",cf9420e4-988a-52ba-aef5-99f6b1064580,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/23/travel/23BITES/23BITES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=bed25976cef3039d902b5f5afc9c19343c645e4c151b414cc73a751c4076abab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A dish with dumplings made from masa ground by a neighboring taco shop and served with braised pork and brussels sprout leaves uses local ingredients to bring back Coloradan cuisine.,cf9420e4-988a-52ba-aef5-99f6b1064580,N24News/imgs/cf9420e4-988a-52ba-aef5-99f6b1064580.jpg,4

Technology,One of Amazon's Most Powerful Critics Lives in Its Backyard,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/03/technology/amazon-pramila-jayapal.html,"WASHINGTON -- Representative Pramila Jayapal was walking a fine line when she arrived at Amazon's Seattle headquarters on a chilly day last October to meet with some of the company's top executives. A liberal Democrat, Ms. Jayapal wanted to raise concerns about Amazon's dominance and treatment of its workers. But her district, which includes much of Seattle, is home to many white-collar Amazon employees who may be unsympathetic to attacks on the company. She hoped to address her concerns privately. As the hours wore on, though, Ms. Jayapal felt she was getting nowhere, she said in her first extended interview about her relationship with Amazon. She would raise a concern, only to be told by the executives that there was no truth to the stories that had been reported. Now, after months of rising frustration with the company, she is taking her concerns public. ""I try to have these discussions,"" she said, ""but I'm at the end of the private line.""

Ms. Jayapal's changing approach reflects the increasing criticism of Amazon. On Friday, she joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers who called for Jeff Bezos, Amazon's chief executive, to testify before Congress. A big part of the reason they want to hear from him are concerns that an Amazon lawyer may have misled Ms. Jayapal during a hearing last summer. Many progressives like Ms. Jayapal argue that the internet giant exploits workers and abuses its market power. Those criticisms have become louder during the coronavirus pandemic, which has made the public more dependent on Amazon's store and put the workers who keep it humming under intense pressure. But no other national elected official with Ms. Jayapal's liberal politics has a district filled with Amazon's corporate employees, who could be skeptical of her criticism but have become increasingly concerned about the company's treatment of workers in its supply chain. ""Two things can be true at the same time,"" Ms. Jayapal said. ""A company can be doing tremendous work that is incredibly valued and essential, and it can be treating workers badly.""

""We have tried to build a constructive relationship with Representative Jayapal, but that has proven difficult given her seeming lack of interest in getting to know our company and the facts,"" Mr. Herdener said. ""For example, she claims to have concerns about employee safety, yet she's declined our invitation to visit a fulfillment center to see for herself, and chose instead to attack us in the media."" Ms. Jayapal, 54, was elected to the House in 2016 after a stint as a state legislator and a career as an activist, jobs that had put her at odds with some of the major companies that call Seattle home. ""When I came in, I made a round of calls to everybody, and I said, 'Look, I know we haven't always seen eye to eye, but I represent the district and you're an employer in the district, and I want to hear what you have to say,'"" she said. She rose to become a co-chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and a prominent voice on the national left. These days, Ms. Jayapal is hunkered down with her family in Seattle when she's not in the nation's capital. The pandemic, she said, has made them more reliant on home deliveries, like groceries from a Seattle food cooperative that works with Instacart. They maintain an Amazon Prime membership for the occasional household purchase. ""I do feel some heartburn around inconsistency here with my frustrations around the things I'm seeing with some of the workers and then the fact that I'm using the service,"" Ms. Jayapal said.

She said she had been ""careful"" about how she handled her criticism of Amazon. She said she thought she had ""a responsibility to the people who work for Amazon, because they are my constituents, and a responsibility to the company to make sure that I'm trying to engage in a dialogue at least before making judgments."" But by last fall, she had become more exasperated, Ms. Jayapal said. After she asked the company for a meeting, her office said, Amazon sent a handful of people, including David Zapolsky, its general counsel. The conversation became ""tense,"" Ms. Jayapal said, when she outlined her concerns about worker safety and other issues, including a report from an undercover journalist in Britain that employees had been urinating in water bottles because the warehouses had limited bathrooms. ""I was getting really just a denial, almost, that any of these things were true, that any of these reports were true,"" she said. She said the Amazon executives had suggested ""that there are people who are out to get us."" Amazon said it had hoped to use the meeting to build a relationship with Ms. Jayapal, describing Mr. Zapolsky as a progressive leader. The company said Ms. Jayapal had been especially focused on the British report, which it said was not true. Not long after, Amazon started backing City Council candidates who opposed Seattle's most liberal legislators. Ms. Jayapal publicly rebuked the company for getting involved in the campaigns. Her concerns grew as she spoke with some Amazon workers about conditions in the warehouses, she said.

Among them was Maren Costa, a principal user experience designer at Amazon who was pressuring the company to address climate change and improve working conditions in its warehouses. Not long after Ms. Costa spoke with Ms. Jayapal last month, she and another internal activist were fired. The workers argued that the firings were retaliation for their criticism. Amazon has said they had violated company policies; they said they had been told that they broke a rule against solicitation by asking fellow employees to sign a petition asking for better conditions in the warehouses. Ms. Costa said she and her fellow activists were ""extremely heartened by the outpouring of support from elected officials and labor leaders,"" including Ms. Jayapal. Ms. Jayapal's concerns were heightened in late April when The Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon employees had consulted data from individual sellers on Amazon's platform in deciding whether to produce some private-label products. It raised questions about whether an Amazon lawyer truthfully answered a question about the data that Ms. Jayapal asked at a congressional hearing last year. Ms. Jayapal said she was troubled by ""the fact that they may have lied to me."" She said she had discussed referring the Amazon lawyer for a criminal perjury investigation, among other options, with leaders of the House Judiciary Committee's antitrust investigation into Amazon and other large tech companies. ""It's simply incorrect to say that Amazon was intentionally misleading in our testimony,"" said Mr. Herdener, the Amazon spokesman. ""While we don't believe these claims made by The Wall Street Journal are accurate, we take these allegations very seriously and have launched an internal investigation.""

Ms. Jayapal sent Mr. Bezos a letter outlining her concerns with the company the day after the Journal article appeared online. She suggested that the company provide hazard pay for workers and give them more information about its coronavirus response. A week later, she and her colleagues demanded his public testimony. Asked what she would tell a constituent who worked for Amazon about her decision to take on the company directly, Ms. Jayapal offered this: ""We are grateful for your work,"" she said. ""And this isn't about you. It is about how the management of Amazon and the corporation as a whole treats all of its workers.""",Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington tried to keep her concerns about the company private.

Movies,Sam Rockwell's Golden Globes Win Fuels a Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/movies/sam-rockwell-globes-racism-cop.html,"Sam Rockwell is the kind of actor for whom ""supporting actor"" categories were invented: a steady, colorful presence in acclaimed movies that are often headlined by higher-wattage stars.

Food,A Brief Guide to the Newer Reservation Apps,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/29/dining/restaurant-reservation-apps.html,"This diner-focused app lists only restaurants it has evaluated to make sure they meet its standards. You select a restaurant, time and number of diners; the app responds with a confirmation right away, or provides the odds that a table will become available later. COST $25 for a 10-day trial, $75 for three months. An ""elite"" annual package costs $1,250. Elite users get perks like priority on waiting lists, access to a special group of restaurants and the help of a live reservations manager. WORTH NOTING You have to cancel reservations yourself. So far, its services are limited to New York City, Los Angeles and Miami.

The Resy app and website boast that you can make a reservation with two taps on your phone (although a couple of scrolls may also be required). Resy works with over 1,000 restaurants in more than 80 American cities. It has attracted the most high-end restaurant defections from OpenTable. COST Free, but you have to enter credit-card information or Bitcoin to complete reservations for many of the more expensive restaurants. Each restaurant makes its own rules about fees for reservations or no-shows. WORTH NOTING Reservations can be canceled from the app or an email that Resy sends as a reminder. On this app and website, reservation options appear when you pull up reviews of any of the 4,000 or so restaurants that have signed on with Yelp. Enter your request, then swipe and click on the reservation time you want. As you view Yelp reviews, a filter allows you to find the restaurants that take reservations via Yelp.

WORTH NOTING You can get money back on meals by giving Yelp your credit-card information and using that card to pay. Enter a request, and this app shows the restaurants it has listed that have what you're looking for. Press the specific time you want, then enter your name, phone number and email address. WORTH NOTING The number of restaurants that use Reserve in each market varies widely, with more in Chicago and Boston and fewer in, say, New York. Though its 850 clients include many top restaurants like Blue Hill and Le Coucou, tables are rarely available in prime hours. Reserve also shows several restaurants that have no tables available, which can be annoying. This is the reservation app every parent has waited for. Owned by Yelp, it features only restaurants that don't take reservations and instead rely on a waiting list, like a Chili's at the local mall. Nowait shows how long the wait is at various casual restaurants, and allows you to reserve a spot on a restaurant's waiting list without going there. WORTH NOTING The app sends a polite reminder to your phone when it's time to start heading to the restaurant.

Like Nowait, the Spotluck app isn't interested in hot restaurants. Its goal is to fill seats in local places using an algorithm that incorporates the day of the week, time and weather, among other things, to calculate what kind of discount it would take to motivate a diner to eat out. WORTH NOTING You spin a virtual wheel (only one spin allowed each day) that randomly selects a restaurant and attaches a discount of up to 30 percent for a meal there. If you want to eat elsewhere, you may select one of the other restaurants shown and get a smaller discount there. A recent spin on a Monday in Midtown Manhattan came up with a 25 percent discount at the Croton Reservoir Tavern, but also offered 10 percent off at Boccone and 20 other places in the area. This app and website allow you to choose a restaurant, order a meal, pay for it and pick a time to eat it. When you show up, your meal is ready. The goal is to help restaurants get diners in and out in less than an hour.

Art & Design,Scouring 11 Time Zones for a Contemporary Russian Art Show,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/arts/design/scouring-11-time-zones-for-a-contemporary-russian-art-show.html,"MOSCOW -- It was an old Soviet tradition: No national art exhibition in Moscow was complete without at least one work from every region. Never mind that geographical balance often resulted in kitsch. Look at ""The People's Friendship Fountain,"" for example, which dominates a major park here that is still called the Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy. (Soviet, or what?) The fountain consists of 16 gilded maidens, each in the national costume of one republic of the Soviet Union, proffering local bounty like wheat or corn. So the Garage Museum of Contemporary Art faced a certain quandary as it took on the challenge of assembling the first representative sample of contemporary art today in Russia -- did it have to be a traditional geographic catalog, or would some other criterion work for a country that covers 11 time zones.

Six curators scoured some 40 cities, from Kaliningrad to Vladivostok, examining works by hundreds of artists and whittling the selection down to 68 works in seven representative categories. ""We discovered criteria, categories, optics and dimensions that we could not have in any way imagined before our trips,"" said Tatiana Volkova, one of the curators. The resulting exhibition, given the somewhat ambitious title of the Triennial of Russian Contemporary Art, opened on March 10 for two months to mixed reviews, underscoring just how difficult it is to boil down such a vast, complex country to just one exhibition. Despite the effort to find unknown talent in the hinterlands, there was a high percentage of works from Moscow and St. Petersburg, critics found. At least one argued that a universal theme would have been better than seven.

""I would have liked to see more new, but maybe there is none,"" Olga Kabanova, the art critic for the Vedomosti newspaper, said in an interview. ""The Triennial does give an understanding of contemporary art in Russia -- there are national stars and there are unknown artists worthy of attention and support."" A total of 200 portfolios are to be displayed eventually on the Triennial's website. The Garage Museum has been housed here since 2015 in a former 1,200-seat Soviet-era cafeteria in Gorky Park retrofitted by Rem Koolhaas. The founders helped kindle something of a rage among Moscow tycoons for building private art museums, with about 10 open or under construction. Russian plutocrats buy plenty of pricey Western art, too, but like a dowager who wears only her paste jewels in public, they tend to stash their Picassos, Bacons and Richters abroad. Given the fickle hand of Russian law, expensive art serves not least as Midas-like savings accounts out of reach over the border. Instead, these new institutions mostly specialize in Russian art from different epochs. Ms. Zhukova, from the outset, said she wanted to use Garage to explore Russian contemporary art, and from there give it international exposure.

Yet Ekaterina Inozemtseva, one of the curators, discovered two striking works there. One included in the ""Common Language"" category is a short video by a budding filmmaker, Zaurbek Tsugaev, 33, titled ""Hands-iPhone."" In it, an elderly grandmother runs her hands over an iPhone, seemingly trying to figure out how it works. ""What a contrast between the landscape of her hands and the flatness of the new gadget,"" Ms. Inozemtseva said during a tour of the show. Another piece from Chechnya in the ""Fidelity to Place"" category consisted of black-and-white metal house numbers from a Grozny street, with half missing at random. The artist, Aslan Gaisumov, 25, said he searched for artifacts from old Grozny and the 50 battered plaques were all he could find from one of the many streets leveled during recent wars with Russia. ""To me that was like a counter-memorial that brought back a certain memory before the war,"" said Roxana Marcoci, a senior curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, who was in Moscow for the Triennial's opening. ""It was done in a way that was postconceptual, but dealt with history."" Ms. Marcoci found the ""Art in Action"" category -- basically political art -- especially intriguing because Russian domestic politics rarely make headlines abroad. Much of the art in this section, often created by collectives, focused on the plight of Russian women.

Given the country's history, periodic references to Soviet life were inevitable. The choreographer Sasha Pirogova, 31, created the video ""Queue,"" of a dance piece based on a famous novel by Vladimir Sorokin. The book focused in detail on the almost biological life of the endless lines for everything in the Soviet Union. In ""Queue,"" some performers inked their position in line -- No. 1,227, for example -- right on their bodies as the line appeared to continue for eternity. Ms. Pirogova will be among the artists representing Russia in the next Venice Biennale. The ""Master Figure"" category grouped artists with long-established reputations. Ilgizar Khasanov, 58, from the Kazan in the south, presented a trilogy, ""Female, Male, Red,"" addressing gender issues. The striking centerpiece, ""Red,"" was inspired by starkly different gender roles in the Soviet Union. It consisted of a giant mobile made up of dozens of ordinary objects -- all Communist red -- used by the two sexes as they matured. Objects like a hairbrush and a dress are on one side; male icons like boxing gloves and toy cars on the other. Mr. Khasanov said that he was struck by the growing nostalgia for the Soviet Union despite its many problems, so he wanted to explore why people ""want to become Soviet again."" The plethora of work disguised just how hard it is to become an artist, noted Taus Makhacheva, 33, whose work ""The Way of an Object"" consisted of three puppets, modeled on museum objects from her native Dagestan, which take on a life of their own.

The Soviet Union treated artists well, she noted, granting them subsidized apartments, studios and vacations, and helping to distribute their work. No art scene in any Russian city receives any remotely similar support, she said. ""All these scenes exist 'despite' -- despite the reality, despite no support, despite everything,"" Ms. Makhacheva said. ""It is art despite, which makes it incredibly real and incredibly beautiful."" Over all, both locals and outsiders find the Triennial uneven, but ultimately an engaging start toward exposing contemporary Russian art to the world. Ms. Marcoci, from MoMA, called the exhibition ""an eye-opener"" with a ""conversational feel."" ""It is the first triennial of Russian art, but what is Russia?"" she said. ""Russia is a place grounded in multiple cultures -- it is uneven, but it felt like an exhibition with a lot of energy and an element of disruptiveness.""","The Garage Museum took on the challenge of hosting the Triennial of Russian Contemporary Art, an uneven and ambitious showcase in Moscow.",68c05884-fed2-53f9-af22-d32d548ef2ad,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/12/arts/12garage-1/11garage3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=914ed555c8fe40eaad05a1381519c5095f3a8153ef3e51e8782adf1a8ea9244f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artist Ilgizar Khasanov with his work ""Red,"" which addresses gender, at the Triennial of Russian Contemporary Art at the Garage Museum in Moscow.",68c05884-fed2-53f9-af22-d32d548ef2ad,N24News/imgs/68c05884-fed2-53f9-af22-d32d548ef2ad.jpg,14
Media,Mark Halperin's 'Game Change' Partner Says He Was Unaware,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/business/media/mark-halperin-game-change.html,"For the political journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann, work on the third installment of their popular ""Game Change"" book series -- set to be an insiders' account of the final two months of the 2016 presidential race -- came to an abrupt halt last Wednesday at around 10 a.m. That was when Mr. Heilemann received a call from a shaken Mr. Halperin, who informed his longtime partner in writing and reporting that CNN was about to publish a potentially damaging story. Several of Mr. Halperin's former colleagues at ABC News had accused him of sexual harassment and sexual assault. It was a short conversation. Before it was over, Mr. Halperin said he was sorry. ""I had never heard of, been exposed to or had any inkling of the notion that he had engaged in any behavior that could be described in even the broadest sense of being sexual harassment or sexual assault,"" Mr. Heilemann said, in his first public remarks since the claims against Mr. Halperin surfaced. He added, ""I was flabbergasted and shocked."" The two men were among the most successful and well-compensated teams in journalism. Their nine-year partnership generated an Emmy Award-winning HBO film, a pair of lucrative television franchises and best-selling books that defined a now-common kind of gossipy political reporting.

The partnership is now over. Hours after CNN's report about Mr. Halperin, Penguin Press killed the pair's coming book, and HBO pulled out of a planned mini-series based on it. Showtime, which airs their political documentary series, ""The Circus,"" said Mr. Halperin would not return. In the interview, Mr. Heilemann said he was still coming to terms with the accusations that have been lodged against his longtime collaborator. Mr. Halperin -- who has denied allegations of groping and assault, but acknowledged pursuing relationships with ABC colleagues -- worked at ABC until 2007, roughly a year before he teamed up with Mr. Heilemann for ""Game Change"" during the 2008 presidential campaign. ""The bare nature of the accusations are horrific and shocking and terrible,"" Mr. Heilemann said. ""These behaviors are not the behaviors that I witnessed, and they're not consistent with the person that I thought I knew. That's not an excuse. That's just the truth."" Mr. Halperin declined to comment for this article. The allegations against him, which have expanded in recent days as more women have come forward, place him in a group of media figures felled by claims of sexual misconduct in the wake of numerous allegations against the film mogul Harvey Weinstein. They include the literary editor Leon Wieseltier, the New Republic publisher Hamilton Fish, the Vox editorial director Lockhart Steele and the head of Amazon Studios, Roy Price. Mr. Halperin's alleged misconduct with younger subordinates has been described as predatory and a sign of endemic sexism in television news.

It remains unclear what will become of Mr. Halperin's contributions to the scuttled third installment in the ""Game Change"" series. The pair had conducted roughly 300 interviews for the book in recent months, Mr. Heilemann said.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation.
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed. ""We've done reporting that touches on important things both for history and for the current national dialogue,"" he said. For years, Mr. Halperin played the Washington insider to Mr. Heilemann's freewheeling descendant of Hunter S. Thompson, whose likeness he uses for his Twitter profile. The two achieved riches and prominence that most reporters only dream about. They moved through the crowds at rallies lit up by their own dedicated Showtime camera crew. Their employer, Bloomberg News, installed a huge promotional poster for their show featuring their images on the side of the Marriott in Des Moines, a popular hangout for campaign reporters. Their style was derided in some quarters as superficial, and some pundits criticized Mr. Halperin's interviews with President Trump during his candidacy as too cozy. ""Game Change,"" a No. 1 best-seller, sold nearly half a million copies; its HBO film adaptation won Emmys and Golden Globes. They wrote a sequel, ""Double Down: Game Change 2012,"" and appeared frequently on cable news; Bloomberg was said to be paying Mr. Halperin and Mr. Heilemann salaries in the range of $1 million. Mr. Heilemann, who made his reputation at Wired, The New Yorker and New York magazine, dreamed up the idea for ""Game Change"" -- a Hollywood-style account of a presidential election -- while vacationing in Aspen, Colo. He pitched the idea to Mr. Halperin, an acquaintance from the campaign trail, during a ride to a John McCain rally in 2008.

""Mark was my friend,"" Mr. Heilemann said. ""I cared about him then, and I care about him now. It's also the case that Mark wasn't in the circle of my closest friends."" Many of their interviews were conducted jointly. Asked if he could use that material for a prospective solo project, Mr. Heilemann replied: ""T.B.D. It's complicated."" Showtime said that the network remained on good terms with Mr. Heilemann and that it was examining whether ""The Circus"" will go on without Mr. Halperin. NBC News, where Mr. Heilemann is a contributor, has severed ties with Mr. Halperin. The men worked closely for nearly a decade, including a two-year stretch of near-daily contact for their Bloomberg TV show. What would Mr. Heilemann say to a skeptic who found it difficult to believe that he had been unaware of Mr. Halperin's alleged misbehavior? ""I would never try to argue anybody out of their skepticism about anything,"" Mr. Heilemann said. ""All I can say is, I barely knew Mark in the period of time when he stands accused of doing these things. People are entitled to their opinions about what I should have known, or must have known, or whatever. But the timeline is what the timeline is."" He added: ""I hope that my reputation has not been damaged by this. I don't feel like I'm crumpled in the corner in some way.""","The political journalist John Heilemann said he hadn't had ""any inkling"" of the misconduct alleged by several women concerning his co-author of nine years.",f5c76a25-8241-533a-8be1-8b9da8bbc2af,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/01/business/01HEILEMANN1/01HEILEMANN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=87df35e3f9ff4453f2e7167e14799d372fae9fc92f7735d6534ac2477b7b7c7f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Heilemann, right, and Mark Halperin discussing ""The Circus,"" their Showtime series, early last year.

Fashion & Style,Beyond the Pantsuit,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/02/fashion/chanel-alexander-mcqueen-paris-fashion-week.html,"PARIS -- It was raining on the final morning of the Paris shows, gray and overcast, but under the glass ceiling of the Grand Palais all was sunny and warm. The designer Karl Lagerfeld had built a beach, complete with dunes, sea grasses and surf lapping at the shore, through which the models splashed barefoot. The sand had come from a quarry outside the city and was due to be returned; the water's ebb and flow was controlled by hidden pistons, but the carefree mood was real.

There has been a lot of talk about women warriors during this season: Women taking it to the front lines; women gearing up for battles, supreme or otherwise; women readying themselves to fight for their cause. Mr. Lagerfeld was having none of it.

Instead he was having fun with leggings, with the house's classic boucle (boxy, oversized, slashed at the side like couture to show miniskirts beneath), with straw hats and Chanel logos and swirling parasol prints. Also little black dresses (tiered, flapper style, in silk chiffon). Also denim (palazzo-sized, with a monochromatic maillot). Bike shorts. Patent macs. You name it, he probably did it. Some more attractively than others. Chanel is a formula by now: Take some tweed, some quilting, add a dash of contemporary trend, a pinch of pearls and a sprinkling of double Cs, throw it all in a pot and stir. If a few of the ingredients make your nose wrinkle, like those lumpy oversized jackets, it's O.K. -- there are some sorbet-refreshing silk slips and shirt coverups about to go in, too.

What there isn't, even among all the choice, is what we have historically considered women's armor: the pantsuit. Granted, it's not traditionally a Chanel thing; the house tends more to the lunchable skirt suit, though even that was only nominally present. But Mr. Lagerfeld wasn't alone in eschewing either uniform. It hasn't been much of a focus overall.

If so, it's a big deal, in part because it reflects the idea that women no longer believe they have to dress like men to be taken seriously. At this stage, after all, anyone who doesn't take them seriously even in old laundry bags is an idiot. Besides, as at Chanel, designers are providing so many options. Choose what you like.

At Alexander McQueen, for example, where Sarah Burton has long been fascinated by pagan history, folklore and the blood of the tribes on which Britain was built, the designer combined the tough shields of leather blacksmith's aprons -- bolted onto one side, belted like corsetry around the waist, in butter-yellow molded bustiers and sweeping skirts -- with the lightest, cobwebby lace dresses, and showed it all loaded up with talismans (on necks, arms, ears) amid the giant boulders of a pre-Stonehenge world. Around those obstacles streamed leather painted with poppies and other blooms; Prince of Wales jackets with backs that had been cut open to expose the spine and trimmed in chains; and a slick black pair of trousers topped with the silver cobweb slip of a summer solstice priestess. The shoulders of a Maid Marian dress were power-puffed.

There's a sense of wildness and danger barely contained in Ms. Burton's clothes, even at their most filigree and flowery, which is what makes them interesting. Not the aggression that was once a part of the brand under its founder, but a willingness to go to extremes, even in something as simple as a crisp white shirt finished with cotton lace and fishtailing to the knee on one side.",Who needs male armor when you have Chanel's beach and Alexander McQueen's pagan goddesses?,44047ddf-2623-53a9-9136-611a46eab53d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/03/fashion/03CHANEL-INYT-chanel/03CHANEL-INYT-chanel-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=af785bdcf84664e4691c2884caab29d0515107bd7f0b8461a1bdff0b4f398f4e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Chanel, spring 2019.",44047ddf-2623-53a9-9136-611a46eab53d,N24News/imgs/44047ddf-2623-53a9-9136-611a46eab53d.jpg,19
Fashion & Style,Does Anyone Actually Go Diving With a Dive Watch?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/04/fashion/mens-style/does-anyone-actually-go-diving-with-a-dive-watch.html,"Ask yourself, how many buddies do you have with dive watches? Now ask yourself, how many of them dive with one?

One man who has made a living doing so is Jason Heaton, a Minnesota-based journalist, who is known to watch geeks as a test pilot for the world's most illustrious undersea timepieces. As a contributor to magazines like Men's Journal and Outside, and sites like Hodinkee and Gear Patrol, Mr. Heaton, 47, has scuba-tested many dive watches, ranging in price from a few hundred dollars for a Scurfa to a $145,000 Richard Mille over the course of more than 400 dives around the world.

Fresh off a dive off Sri Lanka, where, wearing a Rolex Submariner, he explored the wreck of the H.M.S. Hermes, an aircraft carrier sunk during World War II, Mr. Heaton discussed the continuing allure of dive watches in an era when many scuba enthusiasts consider them obsolete.

Q. First off, does any diver really need a dive watch?

Short answer, no. The electronic dive computer came into regular use in the late 1980s. You get on a dive boat now, nobody's wearing a watch -- well, maybe 10 percent are.

Opinion,Nothing Happens When Women Are Raped in Nigeria,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/04/opinion/nigeria-rape-sexual-abuse.html,"LAGOS, Nigeria -- In May, hundreds of thousands of people around the world became familiar with the slight smile of a young student named Uwa Omozuwa. She was studying in a church, working toward a degree in microbiology, when she was violently raped. Within days, she had died from the brutal injuries inflicted by her attacker. When Ms. Omozuwa's death became public knowledge, the outrage was swift and sustained. Social media was awash with posters featuring her smiling face and the hashtag #JusticeForUwa. Talk-show hosts, newspapers and blogs focused on the case. People criticized the public response of the Redeemed Christian Church of God, in one of whose branches Ms. Omozuwa was assaulted. This was extremely unusual, since Nigerians rarely engage critically with anything relating to churches. There was a consensus position: This kind of violence is unequivocally unacceptable. Nigerian women are fundamentally unsafe. Something has to be done about it. Within weeks of the #JusticeForUwa campaign, another high-profile rape case entered the public domain. D'banj, a pioneering and much-loved star in Nigeria's music industry, was accused by a young woman of breaking into her hotel room and raping her.

Seyitan Babatayo made the allegations herself, on Twitter, posting pictures and details of how the assault had played out. According to her, D'banj made sexual advances through an assistant. After she refused, he somehow got a copy of her room key, let himself in during the night and raped her. Unlike Ms. Omozuwa, Ms. Babatayo lived to tell her story. And this time the response was very different. Many -- including a prominent human rights activist -- cast aspersions on Ms. Babatayo and her perceptions of her experience. Her character was scrutinized (what was she doing in that hotel, anyway?), and her motives became the subject of heated speculation (clearly, she wanted some of D'banj's fame and money). Her word alone was not enough; to believe her, Nigerians needed her body, too. But Ms. Babatayo had made the great mistake of surviving. The hypocrisy was typical of Nigeria, a country organized around the lethal combination of a violently patriarchal culture and a puritanical relationship to sex. Here, men are actively socialized into the understanding that women exist to submit to them, meet their needs and confirm their masculinity through sexual availability. Men and boys are conditioned to exercise dominance. And the bodies of women and girls are their most ubiquitous training grounds. Between January and May, more than 700 rape cases were reported in Nigeria. Given that rape, even when there is a robust social and judicial framework for addressing the crime, is generally underreported and sexual violence tends to be treated in Nigeria as a taboo or ""family matter,"" it's safe to infer the true number is far higher. A corrupt police force only makes matters worse. In the past five years, hundreds of women -- including me -- have used social media to make credible allegations about sexual violence perpetrated by actors, social media celebrities, lecturers, colleagues, politicians, musicians and pastors. We come forward online because on the internet, we have a better, even if still tiny, chance of being believed and supported. Most survivors who make these claims don't go to the judicial system, because we know our society.

The truth is, the pain of women and girls -- including the kind of pain caused by sexual violence -- simply isn't a big deal in Nigeria. If anything, generalized female pain is a fundamental aspect of our social order. The more abuse a woman is able to meekly accept, the more virtue she is accorded by the people around her. And those who speak out against abuse are put back in their place. In 2019, for example, a photographer, Busola Dakolo, said that Biodun Fatoyinbo, pastor of a hugely popular prosperity-gospel church, raped her on two occasions about 20 years ago, when she was a minor. She was not the first woman to accuse Mr. Fatoyinbo of rape. The pastor stepped down temporarily, but was back in the pulpit within a month. That's the church. In the state, it's much the same. In 2016, a male senator, Dino Melaye, threatened another senator, Remi Tinubu, with rape. ""Nothing will happen!"" he bragged. Not only were there no consequences for Mr. Melaye's threat, a rally was organized in his defense -- complete with branded T-shirts, banners and posters. He had spoken the truth: In Nigeria, nothing happens when women are raped. Perhaps Ms. Babatayo knew that. Her allegations against D'banj were followed by a strange series of events. Her original tweets were deleted and promotional videos for D'banj's music were posted to her Twitter account. She was arrested by the police and detained for two days. Eventually, after several days of intense scrutiny and upheaval, Ms. Babatayo put out a statement saying that she and D'banj had reached a mutually satisfying ""non-monetary"" settlement. ""I just want my peace,"" she said. As a survivor myself, and one who has come forward publicly as well, I have some small idea of what Ms. Babatayo meant. It is excruciatingly unrewarding, for most of us, to raise our voices against the crushing weight of Nigeria's culture of misogyny. I always believed Ms. Babatayo. And I always will. When confronted with rape allegations such as those leveled against D'banj, we tend to ask, ""Given the circumstances, why would this man rape someone?"" But in Nigeria, the more productive question to ask is, ""Why would he not?"" OluTimehin Adegbeye (@OhTimehin) is a writer and a columnist at The Correspondent.

Style,Miss Golden Globe Is No More. Long Live the Golden Globe Ambassador.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/style/golden-globe-ambassador-johnson-simone-garcia.html,"Sistine Stallone, 19, still recalls the moment when she and her two sisters, Scarlet and Sophia, were summoned by their father, Sylvester Stallone, for a family meeting in their living room in Beverly Hills, Calif. ""I was like, 'uh oh,'"" she said, thinking they were grounded or something. But he had great news. ""He told us that we would all get to be Miss Golden Globe, and we started screaming."" The three Stallone sisters, each one as elongated as a Modigliani, were seen by some 20 million viewers when they helped pass out trophies at last year's Golden Globe Awards. Who knew the siblings would also usher out an affectionate but antiquated title?

""I'm so happy about the change because it's more inclusive and it promotes equality,"" Ms. Garcia Johnson said. ""I'm really passionate about those things."" The move is in step with the award industry's recent efforts to be more inclusive. ""Now, it's gender-neutral, and the ambassador could be a woman, a man, a transgender,"" said Anke Hofmann, vice president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which bestows the Golden Globes. Ms. Hofmann added that the group had been contemplating the name change, and adding more philanthropic duties, for a while.

This being Hollywood, there is fierce competition and campaigning by proud A-list parents for the role. The foreign press association was vague about the selection process, except to say that its board votes on which candidates are presented to the president, who makes the final pick. Greer Grammer, the daughter of Kelsey Grammer, first interviewed for the 2011 awards but lost out to Gia Mantegna. Three years later, Ms. Grammer expressed interest again and was told that she was chosen to be 2015 Miss Golden Globe.

Conversely, Corinne Foxx, daughter of Jamie Foxx, did not realize she was in the running to be the 2016 Miss Golden Globe 2016 until a call came ""out of the blue,"" she said. ""There's an enormous amount of anticipation to see who gets to do it,"" said Krista Smith, the executive West Coast editor of Vanity Fair. ""It's a gesture toward the new generation."" The tradition's track record of picking future stars is mixed, though there are notable exceptions. ""I think the H.F.P.A. looked at their crystal ball and thought I had a good shot,"" said Joely Fisher, the daughter of Connie Stevens and Eddie Fisher, who was Miss Golden Globe in 1992. Ms. Fisher went on to be nominated for a Golden Globe for her role on the TV show ""Ellen.""

Other former honorees have returned to the stage as winners. Melanie Griffith (1975) nabbed an award for ""Working Girl"" 14 years later; Laura Dern (1982) has racked up three wins and is nominated this year for ""Big Little Lies."" Nowadays, a thriving social media presence is perhaps as important as acting chops. ""We are keeping the tradition of a next-generation actor, who is also very involved with social media,"" Ms. Hofmann said. Ms. Garcia Johnson has 248,000 followers on Instagram, where she includes a link to a GoFundMe page for the legal defense fund for Time's Up, a new initiative for combating sexual harassment in Hollywood.","Simone Garcia Johnson, the daughter of Dwayne Johnson, takes over this year, with a new name for the ceremonial gig.",49468979-5946-5f50-bfa1-5a87e9138a2b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/fashion/07MISS-GG2/07MISS-GG2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b1b1192e56bc018a05ff42d6b21809686ad72de06c75e5a5517eb136b50ed849&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Simone Garcia Johnson, Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s daughter, is the first Golden Globe Ambassador.",49468979-5946-5f50-bfa1-5a87e9138a2b,N24News/imgs/49468979-5946-5f50-bfa1-5a87e9138a2b.jpg,15
Opinion,We Represented the Whistle-Blower. The Law Needs Urgent Help.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/opinion/whistleblower-intelligence-community.html,"Whistle-blowers are needed now more than ever. They must be persuaded that while there are always risks, the system can protect them. We served as the attorneys for the intelligence community whistle-blower, and every step of the way we sought to protect them from reprisal, threats and disclosure of their identity. The last six months have tested the boundaries of the integrity of our country's whistle-blower protections, not just from the framework of the law but also with respect to public perception. We were honored to represent the whistle-blower, who has smoothly transitioned to new counsel -- but we will continue to work, as we have for years, to strengthen the intelligence community whistle-blower system for future whistle-blowers. This case showed that the whistle-blower disclosure process can work, although there is much to be done to reinforce it. After the complaint was filed with the intelligence community's inspector general in August 2019, it made its way to Congress for oversight. Though the White House and the Department of Justice sought to block its progress, pressure from the legal team, Congress and the public forced the system to work. Was this perfect? No. But it ensured the serious allegations of misconduct reached the right people.

Our former client faced, and still faces, a sustained public campaign of intimidation -- including repeated tweets by President Trump and other senior figures that the whistle-blower must be publicly outed -- despite having participated in an established and encouraged process that guaranteed them certain protections under the law. Even members of Congress, individuals within the very body that created the statutory protections that exist for whistle-blowers, sought to expose the whistle-blower for political purposes and created harmful doubts concerning the integrity of the system. Joseph Maguire, until last week the acting director of national intelligence and himself an appointee of Mr. Trump, stated in public testimony last September that the whistle-blower ""acted in good faith and followed the law every step of the way."" The whistle-blower demonstrated that one can ensure that legitimate oversight occurs within the confines of the law and the policies and procedures of the intelligence community. Whistle-blowers play a particularly critical role in Congress's ability to oversee the intelligence community. As the executive branch controls classified information, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are reliant on inspectors general and whistle-blowers to conduct their constitutionally mandated oversight over federal agencies and even the president of the United States. In correspondence dated Oct. 22, 2019, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, composed of dozens of appointees, made it clear that ""whistle-blowers play an essential public service in coming forward"" by reporting their reasonable belief of waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct -- and that whistle-blowers ""should never suffer reprisal or even the threat of reprisal for doing so."" Significantly, the letter quotes Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, chairman and a co-founder of the Senate's Whistleblower Protection Caucus, who noted recently that whistle-blowers ""ought to be heard out and protected"" and ""we should always work to respect whistle-blowers' requests for confidentiality."" Members of the intelligence community, whether they are federal employees or government contractors, must follow the law in disclosing their reasonable belief of a violation of law, rule, regulation or an abuse of authority. They cannot avail themselves of whistle-blower channels available to other federal employees because they deal almost exclusively with classified information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could cause grave harm to our national security. It is for these reasons that Congress created a specific process where members of the intelligence community may disclose such information lawfully through an Office of Inspector General.

So when certain members of Congress attack a lawful whistle-blower, as our former client is, they jeopardize their own constitutional right to conduct oversight over the executive branch and intelligence-related matters. Rather than weakening the system, members of Congress should seek to strengthen it so they can be effective in their constitutionally mandated oversight role. That could include, but not be limited to, imposing penalties for exposing or intimidating lawful whistle-blowers and their attorneys, broadening the definition of whistle-blower retaliation beyond employment-related actions and creating a more direct path for intelligence community employees to report wrongdoing to Congress involving White House officials and even the president. We are ready to work with congressional members on both the left and the right to strengthen the system. We hope our former client's moral courage and personal integrity will inspire others to follow the law and speak up when they see something they reasonably believe to be wrong. All government leaders should encourage the process: Protecting whistle-blowers should never be a partisan activity. Lawful whistle-blowers should always -- always -- be protected from reprisal. That is the foundation of our democracy.","Future whistle-blowers must be persuaded that while there are always risks, the system can protect them.",9f5e838a-69aa-52a8-8444-0704087909cb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/01/opinion/01bakaj-zaid/01bakaj-zaid-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=77ff19cc38725ef5fe9898770bbfa1b2caccd1ebaa57cb7fd0b2e212f281baa3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A woman protesting outside a Donald Trump Jr, book promotion event on the UCLA campus in California last November.",9f5e838a-69aa-52a8-8444-0704087909cb,N24News/imgs/9f5e838a-69aa-52a8-8444-0704087909cb.jpg,11
Fashion & Style,"Fashion Week Today: Monse, from a Pair of Oscar de la Renta Alumni, Builds on Early Buzz",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/13/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-monse-rebecca-minkoff.html,"We'll be bringing you highlights from the shows, from the extravaganzas to the scrappy upstarts.

To charm editors, retailers and celebrities to your first show is an achievement; to lure them back for your second, a coup. At Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim's Monse show on Friday night, the High Line Hotel was filled with the kind of industry heavies that designers of twice and three times their vintage still work to attract.

The early buzz for Monse, and the coterie of celebrities (and their powerful stylists) who support it, have barely diminished. Lady Gaga, Selena Gomez, Allison Williams and Jessica Pare have all worn it, and many of those retailers who came to the first show bought the collection for their stores. (It will arrive soon at Bergdorf Goodman, Net-a-Porter and a laundry list of like-minded shops.) That's a feat, as well as a feel-good story -- and fashion, despite its proverbial frostiness, is hardly immune to those.

It also means that the pressure is on Mr. Garcia and Ms. Kim, alumni of Oscar de la Renta, to keep the heat up.

Their second collection followed lines similar to their first, offering a vision of evening and cocktail dressing de-starched -- in their case almost literally, as they whirled shirtwaists and sleeves into decorative details, wrapping them around the body and letting them trail. Smart new shirt options, like the striped blouse that opened the show, picked up the thread. To this, they added bloomer-ish bubble skirts, twisted Grecian gowns and sailor-style tuxedo pants that gaped open to reveal sequins. They played with fabrics -- like tongue-pink velvet and laminated silver taffeta -- to unexpected, and sometimes frankly wobbly, effect. Much of it seemed tricky, and not all of it flattering.",Plus: Ryan Roche does haute hippie and Rebecca Minkoff showed her spring collection ... again.,3a38a446-9925-5596-b647-8192b0df42f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/13/fashion/13-FW-PM4/13-FW-PM4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=8de7b8b9ccc8ebe388ba8fd262864e63e6897f0bdf69952f4b4fc404bc280b11&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Monse, fall 2016.",3a38a446-9925-5596-b647-8192b0df42f1,N24News/imgs/3a38a446-9925-5596-b647-8192b0df42f1.jpg,19
Your Money,Modern Safeguards for a Family-Owned Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/16/your-money/modern-safeguards-for-a-family-owned-business.html,"NO family wants to build a business only to see it disappear when family members get tired of running it. But let's face it, what that business really represents is a large majority of the family's wealth. There are a host of tried and true methods to get money out of the company short of selling it. The founders could take cash out or have the company take on debt to pay them out. They could bring in a minority partner to make an investment. But all of these options pose risks to the company and the family. Samuel P. Phelan and his two brothers considered these options, but they went for a more complex structure that allows them to have a say in the company and give their children control while leaving day-to-day operations in the hands of professional managers. They had taken over Taconic Farms, a breeder of genetically modified rats and mice for laboratory testing, from their mother, who had run the company since their father died in 1955. The company, based in Hudson, N.Y., has 800 employees in three countries and $125 million in annual sales. The United States government and major pharmaceutical companies are clients. Still, no successor among their seven children had emerged.

Over the last decade, the brothers, who are all in their 60s and 70s, had been thinking about how to keep the company in their family. ""There were members of the family involved in the business, but it became pretty evident that they weren't going to become the C.E.O. of the company,"" said Mr. Phelan, who is the executive board chairman. ""The other children were either too young and didn't know their careers or had started other careers."" The Phelan brothers faced a situation common to anyone who has built a business with family involvement. If they sell outright, they risk that the proceeds could have unforeseen effects on their children and grandchildren. If they try to keep the company in the family, they run the risk of the company failing, or worse, tearing the family apart. The brothers reached a conclusion that may not be for every company or family. They decided to create a holding company, Phelan Family Enterprises, to own and manage the three brothers' shares in the family business and to put their children and the children's spouses in charge of the holding company. They then brought in professional managers to run Taconic Farms. There are plenty of financial structures that can be used to protect a family business from estate taxes. But those strategies often fail to take into account the biggest issue: internal family dynamics and how those conflict with the decisions a company needs to make.

""Everyone talks the talk, but few people set up multigenerational structures rather than handing off a company from one generation to the next,"" said Frederic Marx, partner at Hemenway & Barnes, a Boston law firm and an adviser to the Phelan family. The American model of a family owning a single business ""comes at this,"" he said, ""by looking at the family business and saying, 'Let's see what happens when you die.' "" Mr. Marx said he considered what the Phelans did more of a European model of creating a group that manages the original company but also invests in other ideas that family members have. With this model, he said, the founder of the company could retain control of the holding company while giving children and grandchildren the capital to start other businesses -- or do something completely different. Getting the structure right took nearly a decade of thinking, Mr. Phelan said. When he and his brothers realized that their children would be overseeing the company instead of running it, they wanted to make sure the children knew what this would entail. ""We wanted to teach governance as much as it could be taught but also to get that sense of the company instilled into the next generation,"" Mr. Phelan said. ""It wasn't hard to instill that pride of ownership. We had to come to grips with, 'Is it worth it?' "" To keep the seven children and their spouses together, the family set up a family council that has monthly meetings. They have semiannual family retreats and drew up a list of family values that they enforce. ""We call people on the carpet when we don't see the values upheld,"" Mr. Phelan said. While it would have been far easier, and probably quicker, to sell the company, there are advantages to keeping a company family-owned, even if it is being run by someone else, wealth advisers said. From a purely business perspective, keeping a business private reduces the pressure to make decisions quickly. It can also protect the family members in other ways.

""Sometimes you're protecting the inheritors from themselves,"" said William Woodson, co-head of the ultra-high-net-worth business for the Americas at Credit Suisse Private Banking. ""They can't create the kind of liquidity that allows them to invest in other things where they won't make good choices."" But Mr. Woodson said that most families could not make the transition out the way the Phelans did. ""Intellectually, they know they should do something, but they postpone that decision until it is too late,"" he said. And families who do create these types of family structures usually do so only when they're forced to. Andrew Tanner, a managing director in the private business group at U.S. Trust, equated the realization to stubbing your toe. ""No one wakes up one day and says, 'I think it would be a good idea to bring in outside management,' "" he said. ""It doesn't often work out that Mom and Dad have four kids and one ends up in finance, one in sales, one in operations and one in human resources."" Mark Stevens, who last summer sold a substantial stake in MSCO, a marketing firm he created 18 years ago, said he was able to distance himself from the emotion of his business, where his wife also works, by thinking about it as an opportunity to put some money in the bank, bring in fresh ideas and still retain his chief executive role for a couple of years longer. Yet Mr. Stevens, who is 65, said he was open to the sale because he had seen many people miss their chance. ""We have people coming in all the time saying they should have an exit strategy or 'I had one but I didn't act on it,' "" he said. ""I've heard this for decades."" In its design, the European-style family group the Phelans have devised is both pragmatic and optimistic. Mr. Marx said the structure allowed the family to diversify their interests. The cash generated by the company will build up in the holding company, where it can be used for other investments or to help finance the companies family members start.

""There are only a certain number of people who can be in any family business,"" Mr. Marx said. ""If you're able to diversify the business, there are other businesses the family can go into."" For the optimistic, the structure also allows for family members to come back to the company if they want to. Still, there are risks that the structure will be too restrictive and create additional problems. ""It's pretty simple: a family is a very different type of organization than a business,"" said Marion McCollom Hampton, senior partner at Banyan Family Business Advisors. ""A family is historically rooted and it's a place where people depend on each other for their identities. A business is supposed to be a meritocracy, where emotion is supposed to be put aside and the business is run rationally."" And if this exercise in family ownership and cohesion does fail, the next generation can sell their stakes or the whole company. Mr. Phelan said he and his brothers thought of doing just that many times. ""I don't think there is a family that is serious about its business and is committed to it that doesn't ask itself periodically, 'Where would you rather be? Here slogging it out or in the Caribbean?' "" he said. ""When we came to grips with wanting to be on a beach some time, we thought about a sale. But it was never in our DNA to do that."" Now that decision will be up to their children.","The Phelan Brothers, owners of Taconic Farms, which breeds rodents for lab use, created a holding company as a way to maintain some family control over the business.",f6209ed0-590f-56c9-937c-757cfe6d7633,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/16/business/Wealth/Wealth-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=353&w=600&s=99bbcbe1b0bc05e133412c4642ab94b0a3d78404e8ebbee246bb7e2043c5a50c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Samuel Phelan is a co-owner of Taconic Farms, based in Hudson, N.Y.",f6209ed0-590f-56c9-937c-757cfe6d7633,N24News/imgs/f6209ed0-590f-56c9-937c-757cfe6d7633.jpg,21
Opinion,Trump's Magic Word,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/opinion/trump-dominate.html,"Have you noticed how almost every other word out of Donald Trump's mouth lately seems to be some variation on ""dominate?"" ""If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time,"" he told America's governors. ""They're going to run all over you. You'll look like a bunch of jerks."" This, of course, was in that telephone rant about protesters. There is something about crowds of people willing to take to the streets to denounce racism that seems to make the president feel, um, unmanly. ""I will not allow angry mobs to dominate,"" he told the country during his visit to the space launch.

Minneapolis authorities, he contended, were ""weak and pathetic"" until events spiraled out of control and the National Guard moved in. (""Domination ... it's a beautiful thing to watch."") Tweeting on the same subject, Trump reported: ""Great job done by all. Overwhelming force. Domination. Likewise, Minneapolis was great. (thank you President Trump!)"" Which pretty much sums up his week. And, I guess, his id. The president's most famous response to the protests was that assault on demonstrators outside the White House, in which federal troops cleared the area so that Trump could accomplish his important mission of standing in front of a church and holding up a Bible. Critics felt that in the pictures Trump looked as if he had never touched a Bible before in his life. True cynics felt that it looked as if he had never touched a book, period. Anyhow, everything has been going great, by Trump's interpretation. ""And we had no problem at all last night,"" he told Fox Radio on Wednesday. ""We had substantial dominant force and it -- we have to have a dominant force. Maybe it doesn't sound good to say it but you have to have a dominant force."" Dependency on the d-word seems to be catching. ""We need to dominate the battlespace,"" Defense Secretary Mark Esper told the governors during that same rather lively presidential phone call. Despite their mutual affection for the concept of domination, Esper has been drifting away from the administration line. Lately he's been trying to reassure the nation that the president isn't going to take it upon himself to send federal troops into cities uninvited, even as Trump himself seems to feel it's a pretty cool idea.

Esper has been serving as defense secretary for almost a year, which makes him, in Trump terms, a long-running cabinet veteran. Given the way the president treasures cabinet members who aren't afraid to speak their mind, insiders expressed confidence that he might well remain in the administration for quite a few more ... hours. ""As of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper,"" said the White House press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, on Wednesday. It's certainly been a tough time for the cabineteers. Attorney General William P. Barr is getting the blame for all the messiest aspects of that Trump trip to the church. And Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has been fighting off investigations into whether he gets government employees to run his personal errands. We are only bringing that last matter up because it provides a chance to revisit Trump's defense of Pompeo -- that it's better to have him use federal funds to buy a home helper than forcing him to ""wash dishes because maybe his wife isn't there."" After all, if Pompeo wasn't in the kitchen he might otherwise be ""on the phone with some world leader."" Yeah, and one thing we do not have to worry about is Donald Trump doing housework when Melania and all the help are out of town. What could be more un-dominant? The president's super-favorite word came up in his speech to the nation this week, when he urged deployment of the national guard ""in sufficient numbers that we dominate the streets."" In passing, he also assured Americans that they had no need to worry about ""your Second Amendment rights."" Have you noticed how often Trump throws the right to bear arms into these conversations? It's as if he's worried that any time he tells the country things are OK, he has to reassure them that won't mean less armaments. Just recently, while he was unveiling a program to help support agriculture during the coronavirus crisis, Trump assured visiting Virginia farmers: ""We're going after Virginia with your crazy governor. They want to take your Second Amendment away. You know that, right? You'll have nobody guarding your potatoes.""",What we have here is a failure to dominate.,1eccfb45-e8ec-5c89-948e-8bcaefb99e5a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/03/opinion/03collins1/03collins1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9e1ed2735ad219903153cc675af2588b515860442efb77f3622735148803cd92&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"National Guard soldiers protect a park opposite the White House from protesters, on Monday.",1eccfb45-e8ec-5c89-948e-8bcaefb99e5a,N24News/imgs/1eccfb45-e8ec-5c89-948e-8bcaefb99e5a.jpg,11
Television,'Here and Now' Series Premiere: This Great Experiment,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/arts/television/here-and-now-series-premiere-recap-eleven.html,"""Here and Now"" is going to be a weird show. That much is implied in the first moments of the series premiere, as a barrage of apparently unrelated images flashes across the screen, followed by a shot of a woman and a little boy playing on the beach. The camera quivers. The sound skips like an old record. The woman gasps, removes her sunglasses, calls out the name ""Ramon"" and scratches four long, deep gashes into her own face with her fingernails. She says something in a language that isn't English. It's as though we've entered some new ""Twin Peaks"" lodge. But, phew, it's nothing more than a dream. Or, at least, it seems that way when Ramon Bayer-Boatwright (Daniel Zovatto), a college student who designs video games, awakens in his Portland, Ore., apartment. That same morning, he summons the courage to take his flirting to the next level with Henry Bergen (Andy Bean), a bearded barista who might be Ramon's soul mate and who is surprisingly eager to accompany him to his father's 60th birthday party that evening. It's a good day. The only thing that seems off about it is that Ramon keeps seeing the number ""11:11."" First it's a clock in the coffee shop. Then it's the dashboard of his elliptical, at the gym, which freezes 11 minutes and 11 seconds into his workout. After a few of these scenes, it occurred to me that the four gashes from his dream also resembled four ones. Ramon tells Henry about a website that claims that people who are ""contacted"" by the number 11:11 have ""some positive mission to accomplish."" They laugh it off in bed, joking that their hookup is that mission. Still, the extent to which this show is going to be weird doesn't become clear until the final ten minutes of the episode. At the party, as his depressive philosophy professor father, Greg Boatwright (Tim Robbins), delivers an uncomfortably pessimistic speech, Ramon has a vision. There are four candles on top of a bookshelf, and their flames seem to stretch into, yes, four long, straight, blazing lines. No one else sees it.

This tragicomic scene, in which Ramon interrupts Greg's sad-sack monologue by screaming, cursing and hallucinating, is emblematic of what ""Here and Now"" seems to be: a pointedly contemporary family drama with supernatural elements. And, if this set piece is any indication, those two facets of the story won't always coexist so comfortably. The episode plays like a sort of Alan Ball greatest-hits medley. Ball scripted the Oscar-winning suburban lament ""American Beauty,"" then created the classic family drama ""Six Feet Under"" and the less-classic vampire soap ""True Blood"" for HBO. His shows all have political overtones (in ""True Blood,"" vampires ""come out"" to humans), and he loves using families as a prism through which to view American life. At his best, Ball creates characters that feel as lovably imperfect as your own parent or sibling; other times, it can feel as if he's screaming liberal talking points through the screen. It's intriguing, then, that the family he chose to put at the center of ""Here and Now,"" his return to HBO after a brief four-year absence, is the living embodiment of white liberal guilt. Greg made his name as a philosopher, decades ago, with a book called ""A Layperson's Guide to the Here and Now."" His sycophantic teaching assistant gushes to him about ""the way you marry Epicureanism with presentism, then reboot them both into something deeply, deeply moral."" We'll surely learn more about Greg's views as the season goes on, but for now, it sounds as if his ideas were about finding pleasure through focusing on the present, without allowing oneself to become a selfish jerk. That was before life in the 21st century plunged him into a moral crisis. Now, he's mourning his idealistic youth, visiting a prostitute once a week and sobbing on the way home. Greg's wife, Audrey Bayer-Boatwright (the great Holly Hunter), is his opposite -- energetic while he's chronically lethargic, controlling while he's out of control, obsessively involved in her children's lives while he barely acknowledges their existence. Twenty years ago, Audrey gave up her therapy practice to found something called the Empathy Project. She wants her son's new lover, Henry, to be her best friend, because that's just how cool she is with having a gay son. And although she's the kind of upper-middle-class white person who can't throw a house party without bringing in caterers, she does speak to them in fluent Spanish. In his speech, to his kids' understandable annoyance, Greg refers to their family as ""this great experiment."" Three of the four Bayer-Boatwright children were adopted from countries wronged by the United States. Ramon was born in Colombia. His elder siblings, Ashley (Jerrika Hinton), from Liberia, and Duc (Raymond Lee), from Vietnam, envy him. They call him ""Baby Jesus"" because, as Duc explains over drinks with Ashley and the male model she brought along from work, their parents ""just calmed down"" after they adopted Ramon. He didn't have to wear the national costumes Audrey forced on the older kids, maybe because he looked ""WASP white.""

Their parents' well-meaning attention to Ashley's and Duc's origins have apparently made them both fixated on and resistant to their racial and ethnic identities. They tease each other with slurs like ""angry black woman"" and ""ching chong Viet Cong."" Ashley changed her name, at 18, from one of African origin to what she calls ""the whitest name I can think of."" She's married to a kind, dull white man, the father of her young daughter, and she has a job that's very different from her parents' do-gooder professions: She works in the fashion industry. Duc, for his part, is so hungry for his dad's approval that he's become a ""motivational architect,"" feeding clients a simplified version of Greg's philosophy with slogans like, ""See it, want it, have it."" Also, he's celibate. Ramon's messianic nickname, and his soothing effect on his parents, may well turn out to have some connection to this 11:11 story line. But for now, what's clear is that there are two factions among the kids: Ashley with Duc, and Ramon with his 17-year-old sister, Kristen (Sosie Bacon), who idolizes Ramon. As their parents' sole biological child, she has a complex about being ""the boring white chick in the family."" So she escapes from herself, smoking weed, making fake Facebook accounts and wandering around Greg's party with a rubber horse mask on her head. When she loses her virginity with Ashley's model, he doesn't seem to mind that she stays in disguise the entire time. All of this -- the characters, their secrets and hangups, the supernatural stuff -- adds up to a fairly overstuffed premiere. And that's before Ramon visits the office of Dr. Farid Shokrani (Peter Macdissi), a psychiatrist who has a photo of the same scene (minus the torn-open face) Ramon saw in his dream. The woman, Dr. Shokrani says, is his mother. That's where the episode ends, although HBO has said that ""Here and Now"" will follow the doctor's family, too, so we'll surely learn more about them soon. In the meantime, I'm ambivalent. Ball wrote and directed the premiere, which accounts for the strong dialogue. I find Ramon and Audrey fascinating, and Kristen reminds me of Lauren Ambrose's Claire Fisher, the wonderfully angsty teen daughter from ""Six Feet Under."" I loved the conversation in which she reminds her mom, ""I am my own person who is not you."" Audrey and Duc haven't entirely come into focus yet, and Greg is a bit of a sulky, baby boomer dad cliche. (In ""American Beauty"" terms, he's a Lester Burnham for Trump's America.) Most of all, I'm worried the 11:11 stuff and the Bayer-Boatwright saga will never meld into one coherent story. The first episode of ""Here and Now"" held my attention, though, and that's all a pilot needs to do.","The new HBO series from the creator of ""Six Feet Under"" promises a deep dive into liberal guilt during the age of Trump.

Food,Missing an Ingredient? Here Are Substitutions You Can Use Instead,https://www.nytimes.com/article/substitutes-for-cooking.html,"Missing an Ingredient? Here Are Substitutions You Can Use Instead

The most important skill in the kitchen -- and, arguably, life -- is adaptability. The list below, which is by no means comprehensive, is meant to help you replace ingredients with confidence. Every alternative listed may not work in every case, especially when it comes to baking, but if you consider the ingredient's texture, flavor and cook time, and make decisions according to taste, you'll greatly expand your options -- and you may even end up with a dish you like better than the original. Flavor and texture are important considerations when substituting dairy products. When working with liquids, you can doctor consistency easily, thickening milk with a little flour or cornstarch to mimic half-and-half, or thinning out Greek yogurt with water to replicate milk. The ingredients below are ordered from thinnest to firmest; if you don't have the desired substitute for a specific item, feel free to move up or down the list.

Half-and-half: Thicken milk with a little cornstarch or flour (about 1 tablespoon per cup of liquid) or thin heavy cream with a splash of water. Heavy cream: For 1 cup heavy cream, substitute 3/4 cup milk plus 1/4 cup melted butter (for richness), or simply thicken 1 cup milk with 1 to 2 tablespoons cornstarch or even flour. (Whisk the milk into the dried ingredient little by little.) Other options include coconut milk or coconut cream (beware of increased sweetness), or even softened cream cheese whisked with a little water. Be aware that you won't be able to beat alternatives into fluffy whipped cream. Buttermilk: For 1 cup buttermilk, add 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice (or light vinegar, such as white vinegar, white wine vinegar or Champagne vinegar) to a measuring cup and add enough milk to reach 1 cup. Alternately, thin one part yogurt, sour cream or other creamy dairy product with one part milk, or thin two parts yogurt or other creamy dairy product with one part water. Butter: If using the butter to conduct heat, as in pan-frying, you could use olive oil or other fats. (See Oils and Fats category below.) For flavor substitutions -- like stirring butter into risotto or polenta to add richness -- a number of creamy options like heavy cream or mascarpone will achieve similar results. Creamy dairy products: Tangy, textural ingredients like crema, creme fraiche, mascarpone, Neufchatel, Quark, queso fresco, sour cream or yogurt of any variety can be used interchangeably.

Cheese: The cheese world is so vast that it's impossible to cover the entire range. When substituting cheeses, think about its purpose: Will your cheese melt evenly in a creamy pasta sauce, or spread easily on toast? If you're cooking the cheese, you might want to substitute a cheese with a similar texture, but if the cheese is used as an accent, you've got much more flexibility. Most widely available cheeses (predominantly cow's milk) can be broken down into the following broad categories: Oils and fats each have a smoke point, which is the temperature at which the oil or fat begins to burn: Neutral oils with high smoke points won't burn when exposed to high temperatures (as in deep-frying or pan-frying), whereas butter and other solid fats (with low smoke points) burn easily. We've grouped oils and fats into three categories, bearing in mind flavor and smoke point. While many of these ingredients in the following categories are interchangeable, you'll want to base your selection on those criteria. Solid fats (low smoke point): Bacon fat, butter, chicken fat, lard, margarine, vegetable shortening. Solid when refrigerated but liquid when hot, ghee (clarified butter) has a very high smoke point similar to neutral oils.

Most greens can be defined by their flavor and texture: Are they bitter or mild? Sturdy or tender? When choosing a substitute, consider how the greens are being used. Tender greens are often consumed raw while sturdy ones might need to be cooked longer; simply add the greens earlier or later in the cooking process as needed. Substituting vegetables in a recipe can be tricky, and depends largely on personal taste. But some can definitely step in for others: say brussels sprouts for broccoli. You'll just want to bear in mind texture, moisture content and density. We've broken common vegetables up into two categories, based on cook times: Many in the same category cook at a similar rate, but if you'd like to substitute a firm vegetable for a quick-cooking one or vice versa, simply increase or decrease the cook time by adding the ingredient earlier or later in your recipe. Because of garlic's pronounced flavor, it's difficult to find an exact substitute, but leeks, onions (red, white or yellow), scallions, shallots and spring onions are largely interchangeable. Garlic and onions are available in dried form (powdered, granulated or dehydrated as flakes), which are infinitely more potent -- and can skew bitter if overused. Substitute dried ingredients in place of fresh with moderation, and only when the fresh is called for in smaller quantities rather than bulk. Fresh herbs fall into two categories: tender, bright herbs (basil, chervil, chives, cilantro, dill, mint, parsley and tarragon), which are typically at their most flavorful when fresh, or woody, savory herbs (bay leaves, marjoram, oregano, rosemary, sage and thyme), which better retain their essential oils when dried. Since dried herbs are more potent than fresh, you'll want to use less: Substitute one teaspoon dried herbs for each tablespoon of chopped fresh herbs. In general, you can substitute one tender herb for another, or one woody herb for another, but substituting a woody herb for a tender herb (and vice versa) works less frequently. Rely on personal preference, availability and the other ingredients you're cooking with to pick an appropriate substitute.

While many home cooks plan meals around a protein, even that's flexible. Make protein substitutions according to preference and what you have on hand, and shift cook times accordingly, adding longer-cooking meats, like beef chuck, earlier or quick-cooking seafood later within the recipe. You can also adjust the size of the protein by cutting it into smaller pieces (or remove the meat from the bones) so it cooks faster, or leaving it in larger pieces so it cooks at a slower rate. Thinking broadly can expand your options even further: Tofu, lentils, beans and other vegetarian options can make excellent textural substitutes. Beef: If swapping one cut of beef for another, try to substitute tough cuts (like chuck, brisket or round roast) for other tough cuts, and tender cuts (like strip steak, flank steak or filet mignon) for other quick-cooking cuts. You can also use lamb in place of beef in many recipes, though its flavor is more assertive. Ground meat or fresh sausage: Both can be used interchangeably. You can remove sausages from their casings, and cook them as ground meat, or flavor plain ground meat with red-pepper flakes, fennel seed, Italian herbs and other seasonings. You can also substitute ground meat of any kind, swapping in ground pork for ground beef in meatballs, or ground chicken for ground turkey in a larb, for example. But bear in mind the fat content of whatever you're using: Ground pork is the fattier option; if cooking with ground beef, chicken, turkey or veal, you might want to add extra oil to provide extra fat. Pork: Bone-in pork chops cook in roughly the same time as steaks of similar thickness, but you will want to use a meat thermometer to check the temperature to achieve desired doneness. If working with diced pork stew meat, cubed beef stew meats will cook at a similar rate. Cubed chicken will also work, but you'll need to reduce cooking times. Chicken: You can substitute whole boneless, skinless breasts for boneless, skinless chicken thighs: Just butterfly the breasts or pound them thinly to achieve a similar thickness of thighs. (You may also need to adjust cook time.) If substituting bone-in, skin-on thighs, increase the cook time. Ground turkey or turkey breasts also achieve similar results as their chicken counterparts. Fish fillets: Most fish fillets are either lean (bass, catfish, cod, flounder, halibut, monkfish, red snapper, skate, sole, tilapia) or fatty (char, mahi-mahi, salmon, swordfish, tuna). Substitute lean for lean, and fatty for fatty.",Don't worry: You probably have something in your kitchen that will work. It might even improve the recipe.,9b9ece61-38ba-52ac-9e0a-afe70d753df7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/dining/07ingredients/07ingredients-facebookJumbo.jpg,"If you have a well-stocked pantry, you can make almost any dish work.",9b9ece61-38ba-52ac-9e0a-afe70d753df7,N24News/imgs/9b9ece61-38ba-52ac-9e0a-afe70d753df7.jpg,17

It occupies two storefronts, one with a long bar and the other a stretch of counter with a battalion of rotisseries and some seating, joined by a spacious rear dining room. Mr. Westermann has had some practice operating a restaurant in the United States. He ran the Cafe du Parc in Washington and became familiar with local farmers. He is a fan of our heritage chickens from small farms; his menu even lists how many days it took to raise each one (the longer the better). ""In France, it's poulet de Bresse,"" he said, referring to the chickens with blue feet, ""but here there are other breeds that can replicate the taste of Paris."" There are also guinea fowl, Cornish hens, ducks and squab, as well as poultry livers, egg dishes and a traditional Alsatian baeckeoffe casserole: (Opens Thursday): 30 East 20th Street, 212-267-7426, lecoqriconyc.com.

Belle Shoals There is no such town in the Deep South, but Josh Mazza and Steve Laycock, the owners, invented the plausible name and tailor the ambience with a vintage Wurlitzer and a menu of hush puppies, po' boys, biscuits with bourbon butter and drinks like Sazeracs and mint juleps: 10 Hope Street (Roebling Street), Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-218-6027, belleshoals.com.

Freds at Barneys On the top floor of the resuscitated Barneys in Chelsea is a new edition of the restaurant that has been run by Mark Strausman in the Madison Avenue store for years.

Real Estate,The 10 Tools You Need for Basic Home Repair,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/realestate/tools-for-basic-home-repair.html,"Basic tool kits, with all of the essentials and minimal filler, usually sell for under $50 -- which isn't much considering that an upgraded screwdriver alone costs about $25.





Now that you're spending nearly all your time at home, you may be noticing little things around the place that require your attention -- a door that won't close right, or a loose handrail. If you can't wait until quarantine ends to take on these projects (or if a wobbly hinge is driving you nuts), you can tackle most home repairs with a set of basic tools. As a staff writer at Wirecutter, my job includes evaluating and testing the infinite array of tools available and figuring out which ones are best for around-the-house use. I've been using tools on a near-daily basis for more than 20 years, including a decade working in construction as a carpenter, foreman and site supervisor. If you're starting from square one, I recommend getting a basic and inexpensive tool kit and slowly upgrading certain items as you take on more advanced projects and gain more skills.

The screwdriver I use most often for tightening hinges, assembling furniture and swapping out toy batteries is the MegaPro 13-in-1, which sells for under $30. We've tested almost 30 screwdrivers, and none come close to matching the distinct features of the MegaPro. The six double-headed bits -- all you could ever need for around-the-house work -- are stored in a spinning carousel that pops out of the back of the handle. The teardrop-shaped handle fits snugly in the hand, and the storage cap at the end spins freely so you can bear down on the screwdriver and still turn it -- a big help for loosening a stuck or rusted screw.

Tape measures are essential for spacing pictures on a wall, measuring a room for painting or checking if a piece of furniture will fit. A good tape measure is accurate, easy to read and designed with a durable blade, which is always the first thing to break. The Stanley PowerLock Tape Measure, a classic of the genre available for less than $20, excelled in our tests. Not only is it the cheapest, but it also offers the best combination of accuracy and durability. Even after scrubbing the blade with 60-grit sandpaper, we could clearly read the measurements.

Cheap hammers with wood or fiberglass handles can break, or the head can loosen over time. The Estwing E3-16C, which sells for around $30, is a single piece of steel from tip to tail, making it virtually indestructible. The curved claw is great for nail-pulling, and the padded handle is grippy but not squishy like some others. I've relied on Estwing hammers for decades and can attest to their longevity: The one I use most is almost 20 years old and hardly shows any wear.

Wrenches really shine for bathroom upgrades such as replacing a leaky shower head or installing a new bidet. Cheap wrenches loosen as you use them and can strip the corners of a nut. They also have minimalist handles, which make it difficult to lean into a stuck bolt. The Channellock 8WCB WideAzz 8-Inch Adjustable Wrench, available for about $25, is an upgrade in all respects. The smooth and easy adjustment holds over time, the handle has excellent padding and the jaws come to a point, so the Channellock can fit in tight spots. It easily cradles the end of a garden hose, something that most similarly sized wrenches can't do.

To avoid disaster, you should hang heavy items, like a set of shelves or a big mirror, on a stud. Finding those studs isn't always easy. Electronic stud-finders are notoriously unreliable and require a fussy calibration each time you use them. I've always had much better luck with small, inexpensive, magnet-based stud finders such as the C.H. Hanson 03040 Magnetic Stud Finder, which sells for less than $10. This little tool, hardly more than a plastic covering over two powerful magnets, finds the screws that are in the stud holding up the drywall.

Cheap hex wrenches come included with knockdown furniture, unassembled toys and towel bars -- you might even have a few loose ones in the kitchen drawer. Nicer ones, such as those in the Tekton 25282 26-piece Long Arm Ball Hex Key Wrench Set, are longer, easier to use and sold with a carrying case for about $15. The Tekton wrenches have a rounded end so they still fit the fastener at an angle, which helps with adjusting a loose doorknob, for example, or tightening a toilet paper holder. The folding case holds the wrenches snugly but not so tightly that we needed pliers to get them out, as we did with other sets we tested.

Some projects, like putting up curtain rods or hanging closet shelving, simply need a drill. But don't be put off by the massive tools that contractors use. Smaller, 12-volt models are lighter and easier to handle, and they have more than enough power for around-the-house work. The DeWalt DCD701F2 Xtreme 12V Max Brushless  3/8  in. Drill/Driver Kit sank more than 100 three-inch screws into solid wood in our tests, and it has the most comfortable, form-fitting handle we've ever used on a drill. It sells for about $100 and comes with an LED light that illuminates the front of the drill for when you're putting up that closet shelving.

Once you start collecting your own tools, you'll need a place to store them. Most toolboxes hold only a jumbled pile of tools, but the Milwaukee 13'' Jobsite Work Box, which sells for about $100, stores tools vertically so they stay organized and easy to grab. Because of the taller design (it's roughly the size of a five-gallon bucket), the Milwaukee is easy to carry, and with the lid on it doubles as a seat -- a good thing to have when you're working on a door handle or a cabinet hinge. The box has a relatively small footprint and a flat top, so you can easily store it in a hall closet and pile things on top of it.",Our homes are getting a lot more use while we shelter in place. Here are the tools you'll need to handle most projects.,6bb87042-d16f-5bc5-90bd-1a7340dccfb6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/18/realestate/18wirecutter-tools/18wirecutter-tools-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b366fbb5362fbee3fc7354794c25232c7552b71812a6a4cb270c64f69d154ce3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Basic tool kits, with all of the essentials and minimal filler, usually sell for under $50 — which isn't much considering that an upgraded screwdriver alone costs about $25.",6bb87042-d16f-5bc5-90bd-1a7340dccfb6,N24News/imgs/6bb87042-d16f-5bc5-90bd-1a7340dccfb6.jpg,7
Food,"As Manhattan's Chinatown Changes, Food Vendors Keep a Bit of the Old With the New",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/dining/chinatown-manhattan-food-vendors.html,"As Manhattan's Chinatown Changes, Food Vendors Keep a Bit of the Old With the New

Even when I lived hours away, Manhattan's Chinatown was my family's destination for groceries. Decades back, you couldn't find the same variety and quality of Chinese produce, meats and dried goods in most of the Mid-Atlantic. Cheaper options in Flushing, Queens; Sunset Park, Brooklyn; and elsewhere in the city have drawn working-class Chinese immigrants away from this neighborhood bordered by trendy SoHo and TriBeCa. As Chinatown's population changes, what will happen to the grocers and specialty food stores that feed the community? ""One of the reasons Chinese in our neighborhood have been able to sustain our community nutritionally is because these vendors exist,"" said Jan Lee, a Chinatown resident and property owner in the neighborhood. ""For gentrification, people think it'll be $8 coffee, but before that happens you'll displace a fishmonger or a fruit seller who is providing inexpensive food.""

For several years, Chinatown has helped teach my third-generation American children what it means to be Taiwanese-American, not only because they go to Mandarin school there, but also because, just as importantly, they eat the foods, foods that aren't pristine and sterilized, boneless and skinned. But while New York City's Chinese population continues to grow, by more than 70 percent since 2000, Manhattan's Chinatown is losing Chinese residents. According to census data, and the city's neighborhood map, Chinatown's Chinese population has declined by 30 percent since 2000. I spoke to some food shopkeepers, who ran first- and second-generation family businesses in Chinatown. Their answers both surprised and inspired me and suggested that while some see a neighborhood in decline, others see merely a transition.

Business was brisk, especially on Chinese New Year's. ""It was actually like a can of sardines."" Mr. Wu reminisced, ""long lines throughout the whole day."" And Mr. Wu loved it. Choosing products and seeing what sells at what price was like running little experiments for him. So while his sisters went into medicine and dentistry, he chose the family business. With two floors and 17,000 square feet, Hong Kong Supermarket is one of the largest in Chinatown and larger than most grocery stores in Manhattan: The store has several tanks for live fish and shellfish, a butcher section, a back wall entirely for frozen goods, and a lower level for kitchenware, herbs, rice and noodles.

Ms. Truong usually starts at 8 a.m. and works until 10 p.m. (Her mother, 83, often spends the day outside as well.) But she says her business has declined, and standing all day has started to wear on her. She pointed to her bowed legs and said her knees had been bothering her. Would she want one of her four children to continue the business? ""Of course not, I'm hoping they'll go to medical school!"" she said. Her two oldest are in college, at Columbia University and the University of Richmond. My 80-something-year-old uncle in Missouri said that before he died, he would love to be able to eat cherimoya, a fruit closely related to the soursop and brought to Southeast Asia from the Americas. We sent one from Ms. Truong.

The store will also sell conventional tofu, other soy-based products and sticky rice cake to serve older Chinatown residents. ""I still want to serve the community,"" Mr. Eng said. Though Mr. Eng has a family history in the tofu business (his father owned Fong Inn Too, along with other family members, on Mott Street, the oldest tofu and noodle shop in the city), this new store is a somewhat surprising turn for him. He had long disliked working at his family's store. ""Any little thing that needed attending to, it had to be done right away, seven days a week,"" said Mr. Eng, who was the youngest child. So a few years ago, when his parents and older brothers asked if he wanted to take over the business, he had no interest. Fong Inn Too, known as Hong An , closed in February 2017. Now though, at 51 with two young children, Mr. Eng is looking for a steady job instead of freelance photography. He had spent 10 years as a commercial photographer in Russia, where he met his wife.

But she still comes every day ""to point out the things they should pay attention to and how to solve problems,"" she added. One entire wall of this spacious store is occupied by glass tanks, which could be filled at various times with barramundi, spotted shrimp, whelk, Dungeness crabs, King crabs and lobsters. In the center are trays of razor clams and other shellfish next to several types of iced fish, and a bucket of frogs near the back (so as not to scare the non-Chinese customers, Steven Wong explained). Freeman Wong spent 10 years in the finance industry. But when his job required a move to Ohio, he decided in 2004 to dedicate himself full time to Aqua Best. ""I needed a little bit of time to figure out what I wanted to do,"" he said.

The business and its block have changed a lot since then. Its neighbors used to be a handful of other Chinese-owned seafood shops, now replaced by an ice cream shop and a Vietnamese restaurant among others. And wholesale makes up 90 percent of its revenue now, with restaurant clients like Blanca and Del Posto, along with nearby Chinese restaurants. Steven and Freeman Wong have partnered with a former executive chef from the restaurant Talde to open a seafood market and restaurant called Essex Pearl. It'll be ready next spring at the new Essex Crossing, an enormous development on the Lower East Side.","The population of Chinatown, one of Manhattan's few historic immigrant working class neighborhoods, is shifting.

Style,You May Be Surprised to Hear That Restoration Hardware Is Doing Great,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/19/style/restoration-hardware.html,"You May Be Surprised to Hear That Restoration Hardware Is Doing Great

On the second Saturday in September, the new RH Gallery opened its doors to the Meatpacking District, looking just as you'd expect: a glowering, 90,000-square-foot landscape of poured concrete flecked with bronze, stone and glass, through which sails a flotilla of enormous gray velvet and white linen sofas. This shopper became entangled in the downy raft of a massive sectional called Cloud, and struggled to right herself. Alongside her, a pair of tween siblings were curled over their devices; when they lurched up and wandered away, sales associates darted in to fluff the pillows. Along the charcoal-colored walls, armies of classical statuary and framed plaster intaglios offered a whiff of the Grand Tour. (""Intaglios can flex modern and classic at the same time,"" noted a design associate.) Welcome to the latest iteration of what began as Restoration Hardware, a chain of home goods that in recent years has become best-known less for dependable fixtures than its cumbersome catalog mailings, once reaching 17 pounds. But here were faux-shagreen consoles, chest-high urns stuffed with bright green moss and geodes glowing on the black bamboo tables, as if the Perseids had just whooshed through. Glassy conference rooms -- more intaglios, more moss -- were equipped with heavy black curtains, for those desiring to shop in private, with separate entrances to admit celebrities.

It was ostentatious, insistent and overwhelming. It was kind of familiar, too, on the site of Keith McNally's old Pastis restaurant, where street sex workers once roamed . This is RH's 85th store, and its biggest. It is architecturally quite lovely, the low-slung, hundred-year-old brick building erupting into a tough, industrial-looking glass and steel three-story structure with a rooftop garden and restaurant designed by Jim Gillam, of Backen, Gillam & Kroeger, the St. Helena, Calif., firm that has designed 21 such emporia. It opened the same week the parent company of Henri Bendel announced the closing of all its stores, marking both another death spasm of a certain kind of retail experience, and the unlikely success of a brand that has placed the same Belgian linen sofas, French caned beds and reproduction African objects in houses across the country. Department stores like Bendel, with its Street of Shops, and Bloomingdale's, with its themed extravaganzas, used to offer wares as an Indian bazaar does: a sensory overload of artisanal objects, along with pieces by upcoming designers. It's clear that Gary Friedman, RH's chairman, C.E.O. and brand avatar, is influenced by that model. But a closer match is the empire Ralph Lauren built, where stylists scout thrift stores and old magazines, and produce simulacra of alternate worlds.

Michael Cox and Felipe Bastos, both interior designers, were also inspecting the Clouds that Saturday. Mr. Bastos liked the fact that the sofas looked like unmade beds. ""They invite you to sit down again,"" he said. Mr. Bastos was shopping, as was this reporter, against the advice of an opinionated friend who insisted that ""white was the color of fear."" What did Mr. Cox think? ""It's a Freudian thing,"" he said with a grin. ""It has to do with retention, and holding your breath."" The designers responsible for the RH empire may be suffering from what the Scottish artist David Batchelor describes as ""chromophobia."" (Mr. Friedman would counter that neutrals are 80 percent of the furniture business.) In his book of the same name, from 2000, Mr. Batchelor warned of a creeping colorlessness in high-end interiors. ""Strategic emptiness,"" he wrote, was a Western problem -- and a sign of intellectual sloth -- that telegraphed a fear of the other. (Like Melville's discourse on the whiteness of the whale, it's worth a read.) Mr. Batchelor would likely be appalled by a visit to an RH Gallery. In any case, Mr. Cox, a principal at the design firm Foley & Cox who in his youth was design director of furniture at Polo/Ralph Lauren, had other concerns besides the 50 shades of gray and white palette in the store. He was impressed by the designer collaborations -- Fortuny chandeliers and tables by Wyeth -- and yet, he said later, he was reminded of Garanimals, the '70s era children's clothing line you could mix and match. ""It's for someone who doesn't feel confident putting together an interior on their own,"" he said, ""and so the pieces are simplified so that it's almost impossible to go wrong. In some ways it's related to the dumbing down of so much of life: an instant pudding interior so you don't have to think about what you want or define your personality."" But social science has shown humans can handle only so much choice. Recall the famous jam study, that demonstrated how consumers confronted by too many options of the same thing tend to not buy anything at all.

The new RH store was seven years in the making. It opened with a flashy party that had caviar bars and dewy-faced models, Martha Stewart and Ryan Seacrest, and Mr. Friedman, now 61, said it brought tears to his eyes. ""I was a stock boy at the Gap,"" he said, speaking from London, where he hopes to open more Galleries. ""I got booted out of junior college. I thought being a store manager was the best it was going to get. I though rich people had color TVs."" Mr. Friedman's origin story is worth knowing. His father died when he was five, and he was raised by his mother in a one-bedroom apartment in Sonoma, Calif. She was schizophrenic, and unable to work by the time he was 15. He carried a D-average at community college, and supported himself and his mother by working at the Gap. There, he was spotted by Millard ""Mickey"" Drexler, the veteran retailer who was then remaking the Gap into a multibillion dollar company. He promoted Mr. Friedman to store manager, and he then worked his way up to become the youngest regional manager there. After the Gap, Mr. Friedman was hired by Williams Sonoma, where he took over Pottery Barn, among other brands, and turned its tabletop business into a billion-dollar home furnishings company. He spent 14 years at Williams Sonoma, and left when he wasn't chosen to be its C.E.O., to take over a company that was careering toward bankruptcy. Restoration Hardware opened in 1979 as a source for old house restorers but by the late '90s had been reimagined as a quirky housewares store, selling objects with nostalgic narratives -- Italian fans and Stickley furniture, garden gnomes and office-style pencil sharpers, e.g. -- to baby boomers pining for their lost youth. By 2001, it was floundering. When Mr. Friedman took it over, he shook out the gnomes and the pencil sharpeners and the board games, and brought in supersized versions of stuff that was reminiscent of the work of designers like Axel Vervoordt or Christian Liaigre. There was a steam punk period, where every object was made from riveted aluminum, and a deconstructed period, when he sold shredded French balloon chairs. It was easy to parody. It was also appealing to a new shopping cohort, men like Mr. Friedman, who wore bluejeans and T-shirts with their blazers and maybe a silver bracelet and wanted interiors to match. In August of 2012, the year the company went public and rebranded itself as RH, Mr. Friedman, who was then divorced, stepped down as C.E.O. because he was having a relationship with a 26-year-old employee, a not uncommon practice for the time. Today, such a scenario might have played out quite differently. In its first day of trading, after Mr. Friedman rang the opening bell on the New York Stock Exchange, shares of the company rose 30 percent. Less than a year later, he was reinstated as C.E.O.

It was in 2012, too, that Emeco, the maker of the aluminum Navy chair since the 1940s, sued Restoration Hardware for reproducing it without permission (the suit was settled out of court). RH is certainly not the only company to make ersatz versions of design classics and many would argue that the practice benefits a consumer who has a taste for something more interesting than he can find at Room & Board but is unable to spend thousands of dollars on a leather and steel lounge chair by Mies van der Rohe, or does not have the time to find something truly vintage. But it's a practice that still rankles many in the design community. Others, like Mr. Drucker, will tell you that there isn't a house they've lived in or worked on in the last decade that doesn't have at least one piece from the company. ""He identified a customer who appreciates good design and doesn't have the budget to go to an interior designer and spend $15,000 on a couch,"" said Warren Shoulberg, who covers the retail and trade furniture business, of Mr. Friedman. ""More importantly, he's created a physical environment that nobody else is doing in the home business that takes people off their computers and into a store where they buy more stuff."" RH's revenues soared, post-IPO, and dipped again two years ago. But then a few things happened: the company consolidated its back-end operations and introduced a membership model, like Amazon Prime or Costco: $100 a year for 25 percent off all sales. Those customers, 405,000 to date, are now driving 95 percent of revenue. Additionally, RH has morphed into a hospitality business, with profitable restaurants and even a food, wine, art and design compound, to use RH parlance, in the Napa Valley. Next year, its first hotel, the RH Guesthouse, is planned to open on Gansevoort Street. Last year, in a collision of lifestyle brands that surely tore some corner of the universe, an RH team designed the new Goop headquarters in Santa Monica.

RH projects sales of nearly $2.5 billion for 2018, up about a billion from 2013. According to Furniture Today, a trade publication that ranks furniture and mattress companies by revenue each year, RH was number six in 2017, up from 13 five years ago. (Ashley HomeStore, a midpriced home store that also sells mattresses, was number one with over $4 billion in sales. Ikea, number three.) ""I like to say that retail has a shelf life, but Gary is only in his third or fourth inning,"" said Mr. Drexler, who now runs his own venture capital firm, of his former pupil. ""It's guaranteed that every fashion business will hit a wall, and frankly Gary has hit a number of walls, and he bounces back."" Lately, RH's appropriation efforts have gone into reproducing decorative items like spiral narwhal tusks, Congolese brass ankle bracelets and carved Ethiopian bowls. There are even a few originals to fit your inner Peter Beard, like antique fisherman's paddles from Indonesia. The reproductions are quite good, but tablescaping your home with such very particular objects that nonetheless have been scaled for a company with sales in the billions does present a challenge, taste-wise. How many bachelor pads can or should sport the same narwhal tusk, set of framed intaglios and cluster of geodes? On Saturday, Judith Bodnar, an internist from outside Albany, was trying out the Italia slope arm sofa in white linen for a pied-a-terre she's bought in Virginia Beach to be near her grandchildren. (""I don't want to be nana in the back bedroom,"" she said.) Would she be buying the spiky purple geode in front of her, too? She would not, because it turns out she already has a few. Dr. Bodnar and her late husband were adventurous travelers, she said, and avid collectors. In addition to geodes, they amassed fossils of trilobites, ferns and fishes, as well as an authentic poison blow gun from the Amazon that includes a piranha jaw to sharpen the darts. ""All I need is a sofa my girlfriends can sleep on,"" she said.","Restoration Hardware seemed doomed. Now, it's a vast and booming bricks and mortar empire.

Sports,"Acknowledging Distractions, Novak Djokovic Loses at Miami Open",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/26/sports/tennis/miami-open.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- In what is usually one of his most successful stretches of the season, top-ranked Novak Djokovic fell short of expectations for the second time this month, losing, 1-6, 7-5, 6-3, to No. 22 Roberto Bautista Agut in the fourth round of the Miami Open on Tuesday afternoon. After gaining a foothold in the match early in the second set, Bautista Agut endured a 40-minute rain delay before drawing level. After breaking for a 3-1 advantage, Bautista Agut dropped his serve but then broke Djokovic again immediately, extending his lead to 5-2 before the two traded holds to finish the match. ""The key of the match was at the beginning of the second set, no?"" Bautista Agut said. ""If I wanted to win the match, I had to be very close at the score. Otherwise Novak, when he gets an advantage, he plays really aggressive."" Indeed, Djokovic had never previously lost a match at the Miami Open after winning the first set, a string of 41 matches.

His advantage looked even more secure when he broke Bautista Agut in the first game of the second set, but Djokovic could not hold in the next game. ""I lost the momentum,"" Djokovic said. ""I lost the rhythm in the second set. I gave him a little room to step in, and he did. A little hope that he can come back, and he made a great comeback. But fault is on me, for sure. I had way too many opportunities that I wasted."" Djokovic, a six-time champion in Miami, came into the tournament with little momentum, having lost to Philipp Kohlschreiber in the third round at Indian Wells, a tournament where he is a five-time champion. The stumbles have come unexpectedly for Djokovic, who had appeared untouchable as he finished his run to a seventh Australian Open title in January, finishing off the major with a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 win over Rafael Nadal in the final. Djokovic's inability to dominate has been consistent with the parity on tour this season: The 19 ATP tournaments this season have each been won by a different man. While Djokovic is still a clear leader of the pack in the rankings, his leadership role off the court has perhaps hampered that status.

Djokovic, the president of the ATP player council, has spent these tournaments embroiled in a back room imbroglio over the ATP board's contentious decision not to renew the contract of the chief executive, Chris Kermode. Though Djokovic initially refuted a suggestion that those things had disrupted his play, he ultimately conceded that the distractions had been detrimental. ""I just had way too many things off the court,"" Djokovic said. ""I guess that affected me a little bit on the court."" It was Bautista Agut's third win over Djokovic in 10 matches. He also defeated him in their most recent meeting in January, in the semifinals of the ATP tournament in Doha, Qatar. Bautista Agut converted 4 of 7 break point opportunities on Tuesday, compared with 4 of 13 for Djokovic. ""This kind of match I should not have lost,"" Djokovic said. ""So many opportunities. Just way too many wasted opportunities."" ISNER ADVANCES; KYRGIOS LOSES The defending champion John Isner reached the Miami Open quarterfinals with a 7-6(5), 7-6(3) win over Britain's Kyle Edmund on Tuesday, while Nick Kyrgios, in a loss to Brona Coric, was given a point penalty for an audible obscenity.

The obscenity by Kyrgios, who produced perhaps the shot of the tournament early in his 4-6, 6-3, 6-2 loss to the 11th-seeded Coric, was apparently directed at a spectator. The penalty put him down a double break in the third set. Up next for Coric will be a clash with Felix Auger-Aliassime, who beat No. 17 Nikoloz Basilashvili, 7-6(4) 6-4, to become the first qualifier to reach the last eight in Miami since Guillermo Canas in 2007. Auger-Aliassime, an 18-year-old Canadian qualifier, also became the first player born in the 2000s to reach a Masters quarterfinal. Isner, known for his serve, fired 17 aces and won 81 percent of his first-serve points to reach the quarterfinals without dropping a set through three matches in Miami. He will next face Bautista Agut. (REUTERS) KVITOVA ATTACKER SENTENCED A man who stabbed the two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in her home was sentenced to eight years in prison on Tuesday. Radim Zondra, 33, was convicted of causing Kvitova serious bodily harm by a regional court in Brno, Czech Republic. The state prosecutor requested 12 years for Zondra, who pleaded not guilty to attacking Kvitova in December 2016 in her apartment in Prostejov. Kvitova's spokesman, Karel Tejkal, said she ""respects the ruling of an independent court."" ""She's satisfied with the verdict because she identified the convicted person as the attacker,"" Tejkal said. Zondra can appeal, and so can the prosecution.

Global Business,Sri Lankan Accountants Lure Global Outsourcers,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/30/business/global/30lanka.html,"COLOMBO, Sri Lanka  Southern China has its assembly plants. India has customer support centers, research laboratories and low-cost lawyers. And Sri Lanka's contribution to global outsourcing? Accountants  thousands of them, standing ready to crunch the world's numbers. As this tiny island nation staggers back from a bloody, decades-long civil war, one of its brightest business prospects was born from a surprising side effect of that conflict. Many Sri Lankans, for various reasons, studied accounting in such numbers during the war that this nation of about 20 million people now has an estimated 10,000 certified accountants. An additional 30,000 students are currently enrolled in accounting programs, according to the Sri Lankan Institute of Chartered Accountants. While that ratio is lower than in developed economies like the United States, it is much greater than in Sri Lanka's neighboring outsourcing giant, India.

Offices in Sri Lanka are doing financial work for some of the world's biggest companies, including the international bank HSBC and the insurer Aviva. And it is not simply payroll and bookkeeping. The outsourced work includes derivatives pricing and risk management for money managers and hedge funds, stock research for investment banks and underwriting for insurance companies. Many developing countries have ""one particular competency that they do better than anyone else,"" said Duminda Ariyasinghe, an executive director at Sri Lanka's Board of Investment. ""Financial accounting is that door opener for us."" With widespread use of English and a literacy rate of over 90 percent, along with rock-bottom wages, Sri Lanka hopes to transform its postwar economy from a sleepy tea and textiles island into a tiny, high-end outsourcing powerhouse. Already there are thousands of other Sri Lankans working in more common outsourcing fields, like information technology and software development. About 50,000 people in Sri Lanka are now employed in one form of outsourcing or another, according to Slasscom, an outsourcing trade group, and that figure is growing by 20 percent a year. During the war, Sri Lankan certified accountants would often use their skills as a springboard out of the country. That is why there are now Sri Lankans sprinkled among executive suites around the world, including the vice president of global business services at American Express and a financial controller at Standard Chartered Bank in the United Arab Emirates.

Now, though, the government and business community hope the country's young financial whizzes will have reason to stay home instead. Sri Lanka's government, headed by President Mahinda Rajapaksa, expects revenue from so-called knowledge-based outsourcing  which includes accounting  to triple to $1 billion in revenue by 2015. The stark wage differences between Sri Lanka and America, or even Sri Lanka and India, are a big part of the country's drawing card. In the United States, the median annual wage for accountants and auditors in May 2008 was $59,430, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sri Lankan workers in the accounting profession receive an average annual pay package of $5,900, according to a 2010 survey by the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants. Wages in Sri Lanka for financial outsourcing are about one-third less than in neighboring India, and hiring educated employees is easier in Sri Lanka, according to executives who do business in both countries. ""Skilled talent is accessible,"" said Dushan Soza, managing director of the Sri Lanka office of WNS Global Services, an outsourcing company with about 350 people in the country. Because Sri Lanka's accountants are still a relatively untapped asset on the global market, Mr. Soza said, hiring is easy and turnover is minimal. In the Indian city Mumbai, companies like his would have to go far out of the city to hire because of the level of competition, he said, but here in Colombo ""two miles from my office is my hiring range.""

Many international executives also quietly admit that Colombo's colonial architecture, excellent seafood restaurants and proximity to miles of sandy beaches make it a more alluring business travel destination than India's outsourcing centers. Sri Lanka's accounting specialty is rooted in the country's history of colonialism and conflict. State-financed universities here have traditionally not had enough places for qualified students, and they were often closed intermittently during the war. So students who could afford to attended private schools instead  in many cases accounting schools with British origins that date to Sri Lanka's independence from Britain in 1948. Over time, becoming a qualified accountant has become something well-educated, business-minded people in Sri Lanka do in addition to getting a degree in, say, physics or business management. Now, though, many students choose accounting over another degree. When Nilushika Gunasekera, secured a coveted spot at a public university, she turned it down to go to a privately run accounting school. University students do not get any exposure to a real business environment, she said, and they have several years to ""take things easy."" ""I didn't think going to the university would add value,"" she said. After accounting school, Ms. Gunasekera joined an outsourcing company doing work in cash management and banking. She now works for the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants in Colombo, a trade group. If the rest of the world discovers Sri Lanka's pool of low-cost accountants, as the government hopes, the country could lose some of its competitive edge because wages will go up and there may not be enough workers to meet the demand. But the government is offering various other incentives  including tax breaks, subsidized telecommunications and streamlined procedures for setting up new businesses  meant to encourage international companies to come here instead of India, Eastern Europe or the Philippines.

As foreign companies ramp up their presence here, local developers are building to accommodate them. In a neighborhood thick with tea warehouses and crossed by rail tracks, Jeevan Gnanam is turning the textile mills his grandfather built into a high-tech outsourcing center. Orion City, as the development is called, is miles from Colombo's slick World Trade Center skyscrapers, near a canal fringed with rundown buildings and palm trees. But it has already drawn big-name clients, including a division of the publishing giant Pearson and MphasiS, a technology company partly owned by Hewlett-Packard, which has said it will hire 2,000 people here in the next three years. ""Sri Lanka offers us a rich talent base that will allow us to serve our global clients,"" said Dinesh Venugopal, chief corporate development officer for MphasiS. Ultimately, Orion City will have three million square feet of office and retail space, including a 19-story building, said Mr. Gnanam, 28, who is the chief executive of the consortium that manages the development. It was difficult to convince his father and uncle that technology, not textiles, were Sri Lanka's future, he said, but they have come around recently. Building the industry and attracting foreign investment is crucial, he believes. ""Economic development has to take place,"" he said, ""for people to put the war in the past.""",What is Sri Lanka's contribution to global outsourcing?

Sports,Nuggets Surprise Everyone but Themselves,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/16/sports/denver-nuggets-los-angeles-clippers-game-7.html,"LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- The game, the series and one team's season were essentially over by the time Jamal Murray stared in the vicinity of the opposing bench as he bounced a no-look, behind-the-back pass to Nikola Jokic, the other half of the Denver Nuggets' fearsome duo. Jokic collected the pass and calmly sank one of his hallmark 12-foot floaters, to the dismay of the Los Angeles Clippers, who responded by pushing the ball upcourt so that Kawhi Leonard and Paul George could brick a pair of 3-pointers. There, in a tidy 30-second sequence, was the full feel of a series that surprised nearly everyone but the Nuggets, who engineered a triumph in the midst of their opponents' collapse. Let the post-mortems begin on the Clippers, whose season ended on Tuesday night with a 104-89 loss to the Nuggets in Game 7 of their Western Conference semifinal series. A year ago, the Clippers went all-in on a grand experiment to lure Leonard and George to Los Angeles, where there were hopes -- no, expectations -- of a championship run.

Instead, the Nuggets will face the Los Angeles Lakers in the conference finals after staging one comeback after another. ""So proud,"" said Nuggets Coach Michael Malone, whose team will open its series against the Lakers on Friday night. ""All the guys committed, never got down, believed in each other and believed in themselves. In light of all the noise outside of this series that we had no chance -- we had people guaranteeing it -- we found a way to beat a really good team."" And the Nuggets did it in record-breaking style. Never before had a playoff team overcome a 3-1 deficit in two consecutive series. After coming back against the Utah Jazz in the first round, the Nuggets did it against the Clippers in the conference semifinals, and they did it the hard way. The Nuggets trailed by 16 points in Game 5, by 19 points in Game 6 and by 12 points in Game 7. They won all three. ""We are just not accepting that somebody's better than us,"" Jokic said. On Tuesday, Murray scored 40 points while shooting 15 of 26 from the field, and no shot was more crushing than the fadeaway 3-pointer he drilled over the outstretched arms of Leonard late in the fourth quarter to push the Nuggets' lead to 18. And there was Jokic, a center who pirouettes with the ball as if he were playing water polo back home in Serbia. He had 16 points, 13 assists and 22 rebounds, toying with the Clippers throughout. If they threw multiple defenders at him, he dumped the ball to cutting teammates for dunks. If they sagged off him, he flicked high-arcing jumpers.

Last off-season, the Clippers mortgaged much of their immediate future to trade for George at Leonard's behest, sending five future first-round draft picks and two good players, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander and Danilo Gallinari, to the Oklahoma City Thunder. It is worth remembering that deal now more than ever: The Clippers gave up a ton. The expectation was that the Clippers would immediately vie for a title. But even before the league suspended play in March because of the coronavirus pandemic, they were struggling to find chemistry and string together long stretches of cohesive basketball. Those issues were only amplified once they arrived at Walt Disney World for the restart. Rivers rattled off the chunks of time in the league's so-called bubble that he said several of his players had missed for different reasons: 30 days for Montrezl Harrell, 16 days for Patrick Beverley, 14 days for Lou Williams. ""Some of that came back and haunted us,"" Rivers said. On Tuesday, the Clippers looked lifeless as the Nuggets eviscerated them in the second half. Leonard and George combined for 24 points while shooting 10 of 38 from the field. ""Just chemistry, being together,"" George said when asked how the team could improve. ""The more we can be together, the better we'll be."" The Nuggets understand that better than most. In the afterglow of the franchise's most significant win in a decade, Malone reflected on how some of the seeds were sown late in the 2017-18 season. The Nuggets were scrambling to make the playoffs when they stumbled that March, losing consecutive games to the Philadelphia 76ers and Toronto Raptors. Malone organized a team meeting so he could ask his players important questions: Who still believed they could make the postseason? Who wanted to pack their bags for the summer?

The Nuggets responded by winning six straight before their regular-season finale against the Minnesota Timberwolves, who were tied with the Nuggets for the eighth and final playoff spot in the West. The Timberwolves had acquired veterans like Jimmy Butler, Jamal Crawford and Taj Gibson. ""They were going for it,"" Malone said, and that might sound painfully familiar to Clippers fans. In any case, Minnesota won that game in overtime -- Denver narrowly missed the playoffs -- but Murray and Jokic showed plenty of toughness. ""We all said, 'We have something special here,'"" Malone said. ""'Let's stay with this. Let's see this grow.'

Science,Deer Antlers Couldn't Grow So Fast Without These Genes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/science/deer-antlers-genes.html,"Every spring, male deer undertake a unique biological ritual: sprouting and rapidly regrowing their massive, spiky antlers.

A complex matrix of bone, living tissue and nerve endings, deer antlers can reach 50 inches long and weigh more than 20 pounds before they are shed in winter. Not only are the antlers useful in attracting mates and fighting, they qualify deer as the only mammal that can regrow lost body parts.

Now, researchers say they have identified the two genes primarily responsible for antler regeneration in one species, fallow deer. The study, reported Tuesday in the Journal of Stem Cell Research and Therapy, notes that these genes are also found in humans, potentially opening new avenues of research into bone trauma and diseases.

""Deer antler formation shares similar biological mechanisms with human bone growth, but deer antlers grow much faster,"" said Peter Yang, an orthopedic researcher at the Stanford University School of Medicine and senior author of the study. Perhaps by studying the newly identified genes in humans, scientists may be able to developed treatments that could ""reproduce the rapid bone growth of deer antlers in human bone,"" and provide relief for people who suffer ailments like osteoporosis.",Studying the genes that let deer quickly regrow their antlers could one day lead to treatments for people who suffer bone ailments like osteoporosis.,23600fd3-c1a2-5c02-8261-d087ed7f8088,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/06/science/31TB-ANTLERS1/31TB-ANTLERS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=6d33b6d6fca9f924d2ead8e5b91a1fc0c18512b6149434bc4b5b56f0a8e5d847&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A red deer during rutting season in England.

Fashion & Style,Beard Envy,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/27/fashion/mens-style/beard-envy-growing-whiskers-facial-hair.html,"My grandfather didn't always shave alone. In the modest guest bathroom of our house in Orlando, Fla., sometimes I was there at his side, wanting to shave with him -- or pretend to.

He would fill the sink with hot water, grab a disposable razor, hand me one with a plastic guard covering the blade, and together we would lather up. I remember the sandpaper sound the razor made as it scraped away his whiskers. I couldn't wait to be able to do the same.

At age 15 I finally had some stubble, but it was so sparse that my face looked as if it were specked with dirt. I checked the mirror and told myself I would be able to grow a beard by age 18.

At 20 I started growing out my whiskers in an attempt to look older for a role, Judge Brack in Ibsen's ""Hedda Gabler."" After two months the results were in: bare cheeks, a fuzzy brown mustache, seven chin hairs. It was embarrassing, given that the 18-year-old playing Hedda's love interest had grown a thick beard in a week.

Technology,Consumer Groups Accuse Facebook of Duping Children,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/technology/facebook-children-privacy.html,"WASHINGTON -- More than a dozen children's advocacy groups on Thursday accused Facebook of knowingly deceiving children into racking up fees from games on its social network, the latest in a string of complaints against the company sent to federal regulators. The groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws by duping children into making in-app purchases in games like Angry Birds, PetVille and Ninja Saga, and then making it nearly impossible for children or their parents to seek refunds. The accusation stems from a 2012 lawsuit. The complaint, filed by 17 groups including Common Sense Media, Campaign for a Commercial Free Childhood and the Center for Digital Democracy, says the purchases were often done without a parent's permission. In some cases, they amounted to hundreds or thousands of dollars. ""Facebook's exploitative practices targeted a population universally recognized as vulnerable -- young people,"" the groups said in the complaint.

In Washington's greater focus on the power of Big Tech, Facebook has taken center stage. The social network's role in state-sponsored election interference, harmful content and privacy violations has set off a push for new privacy laws and multiple investigations of the company. Next week, Congress will debate proposals for a federal privacy law. The F.T.C. started investigating Facebook in March after The New York Times reported that the data of tens of millions of Facebook users was unknowingly shared with the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica. The agency is in the final stages of that investigation, with staff members and Facebook negotiating over a potential settlement that could include a multibillion-dollar fine and new restraints on the company's business practices, according to people familiar with the talks. The consumer groups do not believe the complaint will be included in the F.T.C.'s privacy investigation of Facebook because that case appears to be nearing its completion.

But the children's advocacy groups said they hoped their complaint would continue a drumbeat of pressure for Facebook to take more forceful steps to change its business practices oriented toward children. ""This is a pattern of behavior,"" said James Steyer, chief executive of Common Sense Media. ""Facebook has a moral obligation to change its culture towards practices that foster the well-being of kids and families, and the F.T.C. should ensure Facebook is acting responsibly.""

In a statement, Facebook said that in 2016 it had updated some of its policies governing purchases by minors. ""We have in place mechanisms to prevent fraud at the time of purchase, and we offer people the option to dispute purchases and seek refunds,"" the statement said. ""As part of our long history of working with parents and experts to offer tools for families navigating Facebook and the web, Facebook also has safeguards in place regarding minors' purchases."" Details about the in-app purchases came from court documents that were unsealed at the request of the Center for Investigative Reporting, a nonprofit journalism organization. The documents were part of a class-action lawsuit brought in 2012 and settled in 2016 for an undisclosed sum. The 135 pages of unsealed documents included internal corporate memos and emails in which Facebook employees encouraged game developers to create features that would get children to make credit card charges while playing games. In many cases, the children did not realize that their parents' credit cards were attached to the games or that they were spending real money, the consumer groups argued in their complaint. The F.T.C. polices consumer fraud, deception and unfair practices and is well versed in the issue of in-app purchases -- the charges made within an app and directly charged through iTunes or Google Play stores, for example. In 2013, the agency started an investigation into major charges by children using in-app purchases for things like ""gold coins"" in smartphone games. The F.T.C. reached a $32.5 million settlement with Apple and a $19 million settlement with Google over accusations that children were deceived into making such purchases and that the companies did not properly disclose to parents that they were being charged for their children's purchases.",The groups called on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws.,bfb5e3b5-c09e-5967-bcb3-70d3fd0f96b0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/22/business/22ftc-print/merlin_78242836_6bb75187-02b9-41e1-b853-6d3fd094a55f-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d1594f5cfa357f776e7701cdd9084e713e1afb14e19096d6ba3d03c40cbe66c1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Federal Trade Commission has been asked to investigate whether Facebook violated consumer protection and child privacy laws by duping children into making in-app purchases in Angry Birds and other games.,bfb5e3b5-c09e-5967-bcb3-70d3fd0f96b0,N24News/imgs/bfb5e3b5-c09e-5967-bcb3-70d3fd0f96b0.jpg,20
Books,What Do Presidents Need to Know?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/books/review/corey-brettschneider-oath-and-the-office.html,"Brettschneider's book, addressed to a presidential aspirant, begins with the question ""What do you need to know to be president?"" The answer: ""Most of all, you need to know the U.S. Constitution."" This framing is one of the book's great virtues: It moves the focus away from the too-common and too-narrow question of what the courts might force a president to do in the name of the Constitution to the more capacious question of how a president herself should understand her constitutional role.

For instance, Brettschneider devotes an early chapter to an examination of how presidents should use their bully pulpit -- not an issue the courts are likely to involve themselves in, and yet one of the most consequential parts of the modern presidency. ""There are things Americans should hear from their president, and also things they should not,"" he writes. Specifically, ""You should never use the bully pulpit to speak in a way that is contrary to the values of the Constitution.""

Indeed, Brettschneider's core claim is that the Constitution embodies values, not just prohibitions and commands, and a constitutionally conscientious president has an affirmative duty to promote those values, among them equality under the law, respect for individual rights, limited political power and political deliberativeness.

These are excellent values to be sure, but our constitutional tradition also embodies much uglier ones, like white supremacy, patriarchy, xenophobia and militarism. How does Brettschneider pick out the constitutional traditions to which future presidents should be faithful? The answer appears to come via a kind of Whig history according to which the Constitution has always embodied liberal ideals and has simply been working itself pure for the last two and a quarter centuries.

Thus, Brettschneider, a professor of political science at Brown University, criticizes Republicans' late-20th-century ""Southern strategy"" as inconsistent with American constitutional values, rather than recognizing the messier and sadder truth that it was a choice to embrace one grand constitutional narrative, that of white supremacism, over another, more egalitarian one. But Brettschneider's Whiggery also comes out in myriad smaller ways, as when he says that a couple of early-20th-century Supreme Court cases on the fireability of federal officers give rise to a coherent constitutional principle, rather than seeing them for what they in fact were: disjointed attempts to respond to the emergence of the modern administrative state.","Corey Brettschneider's ""The Oath and the Office"" offers advice to presidents on their constitutional duties.",68c5a4de-7e1f-5a8f-9ced-cf2e2ca19420,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/books/review/16Chafetz/16Chafetz-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=68f34064436a83cf7c0cc9283b2e34c4a4e983615943b86ce3545bf6656dd289&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Signing the Constitution, 1787.",68c5a4de-7e1f-5a8f-9ced-cf2e2ca19420,N24News/imgs/68c5a4de-7e1f-5a8f-9ced-cf2e2ca19420.jpg,13
Dance,Review: Dance Theater of Harlem Regains Its Footing,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/23/arts/dance/dance-theater-of-harlem-brahms-variations-system-review.html,"There was a time, five to 10 years ago, when it seemed that Dance Theater of Harlem might not survive. The company, founded in 1969 to prove that African-Americans could master ballet, had fallen into massive debt and gone into a temporary hiatus that stretched troublingly into nearly a decade.

In 2013, though, the troupe had a rebirth, a bit rough yet promising. In the years since, it hasn't been just the company's shrunken size (down from 55 dancers to 16 or 17) that has made it seem like a newborn. There have also been wobbles of technique and confidence, lurches and stumbles of taste. But at City Center on Friday and Saturday, as the troupe presented its fifth New York season since the reboot, there were many encouraging signs that this beloved company has found its footing.

Of the two New York premieres, ""Brahms Variations,"" by the group's under-recognized resident choreographer, Robert Garland, looked backward. Very much in a mode of George Balanchine, who was a godfather to this troupe, and his vision of the symmetries and hierarchies of French-Russian classicism, ""Brahms Variations"" is exceedingly polite, but such decorum and taste are rare enough to astonish. Moreover, what Mr. Garland has characterized as ""Harlem Swag"" comes across in his subtle musicality, which seems attached to the underpinnings of the score, with movement and music syncing at just the right moments.

That's not any old Harlem swag. That's Dance Theater of Harlem swag -- what the company used to be known for -- and it's wonderful to see. Not everyone in Friday night's cast seemed fully assured in this classical mode -- a nagging problem since the rebirth -- but watching the leads especially (Chyrstyn Fentroy and Da'Von Doane), you could believe in this company pulling the past into the present.","The troupe presented its fifth New York season since its reboot, at City Center.",d7ee5a0f-54c0-5968-b36a-206c9403784e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/24/arts/24DANCEHARLEM1/24DANCEHARLEM1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=344b683fa6b27179b9cda99e70410efc7da50465bdd6a8ad4ee45d469fb98e6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Chyrstyn Fentroy and Da'Von Doane, foreground, with other members of Dance Theater of Harlem performing in ""Brahms Variations"" at City Center.",d7ee5a0f-54c0-5968-b36a-206c9403784e,N24News/imgs/d7ee5a0f-54c0-5968-b36a-206c9403784e.jpg,6
Automobiles,Corvette Plays Dress-Up: Now Isn't That Special?,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/06/automobiles/autoreviews/06WHEEL.html,"WHAT IS IT? An All-American sports car, available as coupe or convertible. HOW MUCH? Coupe base price, $55,720 (convertible $59,530); as tested, $69,855 including $1,750 navigation system, $7,705 Premium Equipment Group (leather wrapped interior, upgraded audio system, heads-up display and more) and $1,195 Grand Sport Heritage Package (fender stripes, two-tone seats, embroidered headrest logos). WHAT MAKES IT RUN? A 6.2-liter V-8 with 430 or 436 horsepower; 6-speed manual or 6-speed automatic transmission. IS IT THIRSTY? Considering its muscularity, the Corvette drinks with surprising restraint. With the manual transmission, the E.P.A. rating is 16 miles per gallon in town and 26 on the highway.

SOME good news for Chevrolet: of all the high-end sporty cars sold in the United States last year, nearly one in six was a Corvette. Now, the bad news: Corvette sales nonetheless plunged in 2009 to depths unmatched since 1961, two years before the Sting Ray was born. Between anxious consumers and a flight from impractical sports cars that began well before the recession bushwhacked the economy, what J. D. Power calls the ""premium sporty"" class  two-seaters, coupes and convertibles above $40,000  withered to a paltry 89,000 sales last year from 230,000 in 2003. In 2009, Corvette sales tumbled by half, to just under 14,000, despite offering what is surely the broadest and most desirable lineup in its history. That roster already features the tail-kicking, 505-horsepower Z06 and the bank-breaking, 638-horse ZR1. But those Ferrari-baiters cost a respective $75,000 and $109,000. The basic Corvette coupe starts just under $50,000. Yet that model has been around since 2005, and its been-there, done-that status has fans pining for the next all-new 'Vette.

In the past, to break that holding pattern, Chevy has trotted out ""commemorative"" editions. These have included Indy Pace Car Corvettes with paint treatments lurid enough to make a Nascar sponsor gag on his corn dog. The new Grand Sport is nothing like those skin-deep screamers: it borrows just enough of the Z06's looks and performance to let buyers feel special. Yet the price is several floors below the penthouse of the Porsche 911. The GS is offered as a targa-roof coupe or convertible and you can get a 6-speed automatic. The Z06 comes only as a fixed-roof coupe with a manual gearbox.

The standard Corvette is handsome but tends to disappear in traffic. The GS's eye candy alone  including the Z06's bulging fenders, gill-like side louvers, gaping front air splitter and rear spoiler  is worth a good chunk of its $5,800 premium. The GS appears more streamlined, the wide hips drawing your eye along the slender waist. This is a great-looking Corvette. On my test car, chromed aluminum wheels reflected enough sunlight to incinerate anthills at 20 paces; those $1,995 wheels were the sole hint of vestigial cheesiness. I would divert that cash to the $1,195 dual-mode exhaust: it adds 6 horsepower (to 436) and opens valves under hard acceleration to let the V-8's cri de coeur be heard for blocks. Corvettes are rare on the streets of New York, where enthusiasts seem to prefer the troika of ""Beamer, Benz or Bentley""  not to mention Porsche  currently popularized by the rapper Lloyd Banks. Burbling through the hip East Village, my searing red Grand Sport test car seemed as conspicuous as a flying mountain banshee from ""Avatar"" alighting on Avenue C. The GS is also roughly as fun to pilot as those computer-generated creatures, its swooping and diving aided by a stiffened suspension and hulking wheels and tires that let it exceed 1g in cornering force  a supercar level of grip  before the tires break loose.

With its pushrod V-8, the GS scoots from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in about four seconds. As on the Z06, six-piston front brake calipers snare enormous 14-inch cross-drilled brake rotors, with four-piston brakes mated to 13.4-inch rotors in the back. The manual coupe also gets the fancy dry-sump lubrication system from the Z06 to make sure the car doesn't starve for oil during hard cornering. Don't faint when the mechanic rings up 10.5 quarts of oil  that's how much the GS holds. As with the Z06's larger 7-liter engine, the GS's dry-sump V-8 is assembled by hand by a single technician. On winding country roads north of New York City, the GS projected wave upon wave of Yankee power. The wide-bodied 'Vette can make a driver tentative as it hogs every inch of its lane, with steering that falls short of the platonic ideal of a Porsche. Yet the GS's tremendous roadholding and braking quickly build up a driver's confidence. As with any Corvette, the enormous cargo hatch, the surprisingly tolerable ride and the respectable fuel economy improve what is already a top value. There are flaws. The Corvette's plasticky interior has always been graded on a curve, achieving a ""C"" only when scored with the remedial students  meaning older Corvettes. True, the interior did improve significantly when the sixth-generation Corvette arrived as a 2005 model. Five years on, there is no excusing the uncomfortably thin seats, wrapped in leather so bachelor-pad chintzy that Chevy should include a Nagel print with every purchase. With its volatile, lock-up-your-daughters personality, the Z06 is still my favorite Corvette. (As for the ZR1, don't tell me how many Italian exotics it eats for breakfast  $109,000 is too much for a car with so much Chevy-ness oozing from its fiberglass pores.) For many buyers, the GS is the ideal compromise. Sad sales numbers don't lie. Buying a sports car now can seem like the ultimate in irrational exuberance. But as two-seat splurges go, the Corvette is more like rational exuberance. And if not, there's always a second mortgage.","For enthusiasts who can't wait for the next generation of the Corvette to arrive, the Grand Sport model offers some satisfaction.",cb01f15f-aef1-5a39-a93b-788772aa0fe8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/06/automobiles/WHEE/WHEE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=244&w=600&s=499dea5702917032b3ddaa35f65c77ae1c28afb2c0517dfd766a7fa1f161d6b4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Corvette Grand Sport borrows bits of the Z06, which costs $20,000 more.",cb01f15f-aef1-5a39-a93b-788772aa0fe8,N24News/imgs/cb01f15f-aef1-5a39-a93b-788772aa0fe8.jpg,23
Opinion,Jeff Bezos' Phone Hack Should Terrify Everyone,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/24/opinion/jeff-bezos-phone-hack.html,"If the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, wants to chat on WhatsApp, politely decline. That's the lesson from a series of reports this week based off a forensic examination of Jeff Bezos' communications with the crown prince. The investigation -- conducted at Mr. Bezos' request by FTI Consulting -- found that his phone had most likely been attacked in 2018 after he received a WhatsApp message from the prince's personal account. While my colleagues in the Times newsroom have pieced together details of the investigation, there's still a great deal unknown. And cybersecurity experts have serious questions about FTI's report, which, according to CyberScoop, ""has not impressed the information security community."" Still, the story seems to have everything: from lighthearted, embarrassingly earnest texts, ""divorced guy"" memes and world leaders who awkwardly sign their text messages with their full names to the deeply problematic issue of revenge porn and stealing of private nude photos. Though it's a gilded example of digital theft, there's something troubling and relatable about it all. Billionaires, they're just like us! Or maybe not. Looked at one way, the attack on Mr. Bezos' phone could be seen as yet more proof of what my colleague Kara Swisher called ""the death of privacy."" If the richest man in the world -- the man who sells listening devices used in millions of homes and whose servers create the internet's infrastructure -- can be hacked, what hope is there for us mere mortals?

Turns out, there's some. Yes, your personal privacy and security are constantly under threat. And yes, you should be trying to safeguard against malware, phishing and bulk data collection. But the Bezos attack is an example of extremely targeted surveillance, the potentially expensive and risky kind that is aimed at high-value targets like executives, government officials, celebrities and billionaires. And as it turns out, many of those with the most to lose are woefully inept at safeguarding their privacy.

Not long after the Bezos news broke this week, I spoke to Christopher Pierson, who founded BlackCloak, a cybersecurity company for high-net-worth and high-profile individuals -- executives, celebrities and billionaires. According to Mr. Pierson, few people take their digital lives as seriously as they should. ""The majority of clients we onboard come on in some kind of hacked state,"" he told me. ""Their computers are compromised or their login credentials are available on dark web. Their home camera systems are accessible to people on internet or their entire home and appliances are vulnerable and viewable by persons remotely."" Mr. Pierson suggests that's in part because high-value targets choose to focus on physical security over digital and invest in private bodyguards, camera systems and protections like kidnapping insurance. How bad is it? ""We see passwords in little black books on desks by the machines and in files on the computers. We see passwords that are the same everywhere. We absolutely do not see good use of dual factor authentication on email, health care and financial accounts. I'd say we see less than 1 percent of high-net-worth individuals using dual factor."" Mr. Pierson said BlackCloak has found more than 82 percent of its clients' current passwords on the dark web when it ran an initial search. ""In the case of high-net-worth individuals, the same compromised password is frequently used by 20 to 40 different accounts -- some of those are personal, some are in the office.""

What Mr. Pierson describes is low-hanging fruit -- the kind of security flaws that can quickly be fixed with a little knowledge and attention to detail. Even then, he said, it takes time for the true nature of clients' vulnerability to sink in. ""They're shocked when we give them their password and tell them where we found it, but it doesn't hit as hard as when we tell them their entire home automation system has been potentially online and viewable for three or five or eight years,"" he said. When it comes to a Bezos-style breach -- potentially at the hands of a nation-state's intelligence service -- high-profile targets would most likely be even less prepared. As Mr. Bezos' lengthy investigation into the 2018 attack shows, it's difficult to get straight answers even when you have the money and resources to run full forensics. Of course, it's not just wealth that turns somebody into a person of interest for hackers. Journalists, government employees, workers at energy companies and utilities could all be targets for someone. Those who work for financial companies, airlines, hospitals, universities, Hollywood studios and tech businesses are all potentially at risk. You can take steps to secure yourself from corporate data collection by using privacy settings on your phone. And to protect yourself from cyberattacks there are helpful guides you can use that have been vetted by security professionals. For most of us, the attack against Mr. Bezos isn't the death of privacy, but a reminder of the risks of living a connected life. It should be a moment to think as critically about what you do online as you might in the real world. Invest in a password manager. Turn on dual factor authentication. Be skeptical of any communication that looks out of place. For the ultrarich and influential, the Bezos hack should be a terrifying revelation. As the former State Department employee and whistle-blower John Napier Tye told me last autumn, ""For someone who's truly a high-value target, there is no way to safely use a digital device."" The stakes are astronomically high. Not just personally, as Mr. Bezos found, but professionally. Company secrets, matters of national security, access to critical infrastructure and the safety of employees could all be compromised by lax security at the top. The internet has long been thought of as a truly democratic tool, flattening and democratizing the ability to publish and communicate. It's also the great privacy equalizer. Money can buy a lot of things. But on a dangerous internet full of exploits, flawed code, shady actors and absent-minded humans, total, foolproof security is not one of them.",Those with the most to lose don't always safeguard their privacy very well.

Lev speaks! The phrase ""what did he know and when did he know it?"" is often bandied about whenever a high-ranking government official is accused of wrongdoing. In the case of Donald J. Trump and Ukraine, the president knew everything, and knew it from the very beginning because he set it in motion.

In interviews with Rachel Maddow on MSNBC and with The New York Times, Lev Parnas, the indicted Soviet-born associate of Rudy Giuliani, left no doubt that Mr. Trump knew ""everything,"" and Mike Pence and Bill Barr were involved in a criminal conspiracy that attempted to pressure the young Ukrainian president to announce investigations of Joe and Hunter Biden that could have unfairly influenced our 2020 election.

This new evidence is accompanied by documents that Mr. Parnas recently turned over to the House Intelligence Committee, which will undoubtedly be used by the Democratic House managers when Mr. Trump's impeachment trial begins in the Senate. The only question that remains unanswered is how many Republican senators will vote to uphold their oath of office and how many will continue to support the criminal in the Oval Office.",A reader says the Giuliani associate's statements leave no doubt that the president was deeply involved in the Ukraine affair.,b0c3fb6e-18c9-5031-8f5b-eb5e5e5c5c43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/15/us/15dcParnas/merlin_166609758_87322c82-08ee-4f02-827d-a568d50bd233-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=2ae52641dd58108fc9977e589d2e87e954dd15780528c86271a20a9520d99a24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lev Parnas, a Soviet-born businessman who played a central role in the campaign to pressure Ukraine to investigate political rivals of the president, last month in New York.",b0c3fb6e-18c9-5031-8f5b-eb5e5e5c5c43,N24News/imgs/b0c3fb6e-18c9-5031-8f5b-eb5e5e5c5c43.jpg,11
Art & Design,"Lessons From Robert Gober, Anxious Homebody",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/31/arts/design/robert-gober.html,"Robert Gober, ""Cat Litter"" (1990), cast plaster and vinyl-acrylic, can be seen online at the Matthew Marks Gallery. In the artist's realm, banal objects are given an impossible allure.

These days, as I stand at the kitchen sink, washing my hands and wondering why 20 seconds never seemed so long before, I find myself thinking of Robert Gober. So much of our current life-in-quarantine resembles the anxious homebody world he has imagined in his art. He first became known in the mid-1980s for pristine sculptures of sinks, usually with two holes in the place where the faucet should go. You might say he punctured the neutral surfaces of Minimalism, investing them with intimations of the human body, and bringing the unlikely themes of hygiene and handwashing to the forefront of contemporary art. Mr. Gober's art overlaps with our new, wash-around-the-clock culture in other ways as well. At a time when the pandemic has created shortages of staples like paper towels, common objects can seem to have a sudden luster, reminding us of Mr. Gober's habit of fetishizing household goods and giving them a radiant presence by virtue of his painstaking craftsmanship. Some of his sculptures consist of exacting replications of supermarket items -- a 25-pound bag of cat litter; or a Table Talk apple pie whose cardboard box is festooned with a fluorescent sticker advertising a price of 69 cents. Initially, Mr. Gober's food sculptures seemed to allude to a class of Americans who probably didn't eat kale or shop at Whole Foods, although now, I suspect, amid our pandemic deprivations, few among us would be foolish enough to decline a slice of Table Talk pie.

On the other hand, the family home, as defined by the artist, is also a place where things go seriously awry. He is best known for his sculptures of a lopped-off adult male leg jutting out from a wall, dismembered but still dressed for work. You can read it as a pop symbol of Oedipal struggle (i.e. the leg could belong to an unlucky father who was bumped off, like the Wicked Witch, when a house tumbled out of the sky and severed his leg). Or you can see it instead as an emblem of the American plague that descended on this country in the 1980s, when the AIDS epidemic was raging, and the normally quotidian rituals of domestic life were shadowed by catastrophe and death.

As it so happens, the Matthew Marks Gallery is now hosting its first online exhibition, ""Robert Gober: Sculpture, Photographs, and Works on Paper 1976 -2019"" (through June 10), a selection of 20 works spanning the artist's fertile career. Many of us have mixed feelings about online exhibitions, a hybrid form that poaches on the tradition of gallery-going while emptying it of sensual pleasure. On the other hand, it is all that we have at the moment. In its defense, if the desire to learn about art and the desire to feel represent opposite ends of the art-viewing spectrum, online exhibitions at least deliver the learning quotient of the experience.

The show at Matthew Marks opens dramatically, with ""Death Mask"" (2008), a white plaster oval that fills the screen, putting you face to face with what looks like an affable polar bear. It has piercing blue eyes, which are outlined in pencil, and a loosely painted red mouth. A link produces background information: Mr. Gober created the work after he lost his hound dog, Paco. ""Death Mask"" is a combined double likeness, melding the artist's features with the snout of his pooch. A documentary photograph shows the artist lying on a table on his back, a sage-green towel draped over him, an assistant daubing what appears to be wet plaster on his face. Also provided are the measurements of the work. It turns out to be only 10 inches tall. The truth is that sculpture, compared to other mediums, has the most to lose from digital reproduction. As you click around a screen, the abrupt changes in scale that can make an image too big or too small, too near or too far, tend to erase the psychological intimacy of Mr. Gober's objects and cause them to look like props for a horror movie. This is especially the case with ""Short Haired Cheese"" (1992-3), a generous wedge of Swiss sprouting thin, black strands of human hair. Ditto for ""Untitled"" (1992), a beeswax sculpture of a girl's right shoe, with hair growing inside. It crosses the Surrealist objet of the '30s with the identity politics of the '90s, as if to say that mutants-r-us.

Wondering how Mr. Gober is faring in the midst of the pandemic, I called him the other day. Now 65 years old, he is currently in lockdown out in Peconic, N.Y., on the North Fork of Long Island, in a house and garage-turned-studio where he has lived and worked for decades. I was eager to ask him whether he saw parallels between the current pandemic and the era of AIDS, for which there is still no vaccine. Mr. Gober first exhibited his sink sculptures at the Paula Cooper Gallery in 1985, about six months after the Food and Drug Administration approved a test for H.I.V., ending the period when asymptomatic people had no idea whether they were infected. Are his sink sculptures about the dream of cleanliness? ""The impossibility of cleanliness,"" he replied. ""There is the reality that I worked and lived through another epidemic in New York,"" he said, ""and there might be overtones of that now. But nobody was banging on pots and pans at 7 o'clock during the AIDS crisis."" Indeed, neither patients nor their caretakers were given the cheering support that has been extended to the medical community during the current epidemic. AIDS has since claimed the lives of more than 700,000 Americans. ""AIDS was always fatal,"" Mr. Gober said, referring to the earlier years, before the advent of effective drugs, whereas many victims of Covid-19 are likely to recover. ""The differences are more numerous than the similarities,"" he said. What is he working on these days? ""I am not really working,"" he said. ""I am not making art. My studio is shut, but I have been keeping my assistants employed. There are four of them, and they are working from home and sending me pictures. I have really been out in the garden. I have woods. I have a pond. I have a flower garden. I don't have vegetables, but I have a varied terrain piece of property and I have planted trees and shrubs. I usually see spring episodically. On weekends, or maybe I take a week. And this time I got to see it incrementally, like every day. It was very rewarding.""","A new view of Gober World, where social distancing and supermarket pie are the norm.",29145672-1690-5516-a92e-326e7e8bcf8c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/02/arts/01GOBER-NOTEBOOK2/01GOBER-NOTEBOOK2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=2a6e30945766235334c1d1bdbf4bed71942c1635f640d83c33a4a221fcb8869a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Gober, &ldquo;Cat Litter&rdquo; (1990), cast plaster and vinyl-acrylic, can be seen online at the Matthew Marks Gallery.

Theater,"Lip-Syncing Her Abduction, Matter-of-Factly",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/theater/lip-syncing-her-abduction-matter-of-factly.html,"The day before rehearsals resumed for Lucas Hnath's new play ""Dana H.,"" the star, Deirdre O'Connell, was quietly expecting her bad dreams to return. Having performed the piece last year in Los Angeles and Chicago, she knew what would happen when she slipped back into the role of the playwright's mother, a Florida chaplain, sitting alone onstage to recount the story of her violent abduction in 1997 and the five brutal months that followed, as her captor dragged her across the South from motel room to motel room, frightened and isolated. ""There's a nightmare that gets stimulated inside a person, just thinking about this stuff all the time,"" O'Connell said the other afternoon, in a brightly lit room at the Vineyard Theater's downtown Manhattan offices. ""I loved doing it. But it's sad, and it's scary."" It is also, for Hnath (pronounced nayth), personal -- a story he had long thought of telling in a play. ""And at various points,"" he said, ""my mother had expressed interest in me telling this."" Given how far its details veer from mainstream experience, though, the trouble was finding a way that wouldn't leave audiences wondering which parts were true and which he had made up.

Enter Steve Cosson, artistic director of the Civilians. He asked Hnath over coffee in 2015 -- before ""A Doll's House, Part 2"" and ""Hillary and Clinton"" took the writer to Broadway -- if he had any interest in making a piece of documentary theater. ""I have the memory, and it probably is a false memory,"" Hnath said, ""of it clicking in that moment and thinking, 'O.K., this is the right story and that's the right approach: for someone who is not me to interview my mother.'"" ""Because of course we know each other,"" Hnath said, his evident discomfort -- with giving an interview in the first place, with discussing a play about his mother's trauma -- evaporating for an instant as he laughed. ""I was interested in her telling the story to someone who knew nothing. So that there's no shorthand."" That someone was Cosson, who spent several days interviewing Hnath's mother, Dana Higginbotham, who these days works with hospice patients. The show's dialogue is audio culled from those recordings. Audiences hear Higginbotham describe her experience in her own voice, in her own emotional register.

Now in previews Off Broadway at the Vineyard, where it is directed by Les Waters, ""Dana H."" arrives at an interesting moment for stories of violence against women, with society re-evaluating its own metric for what constitutes a persuasive witness. Reviewing the show in the Los Angeles Times, Charles McNulty deemed it ""a sly referendum on how we process a survivor's story,"" while the critic Chris Jones, in the Chicago Tribune, noted that it prompts ""the question of whether or not you are listening to a reliable narrator."" Hnath, well aware of what he called the ""circular and wobbly shape of memory,"" said it was vital that the play ""match the reality of somebody recounting something really, really horrific that happened to them."" Unspooling recollections of her captor -- a man raised in the Aryan Brotherhood, whom she had counseled in the hospital where he was a psychiatric patient -- Higginbotham offers no florid displays of feeling as evidence of having suffered. The striking calm of her tone on the recordings came as no surprise to Hnath, 40, who was an undergraduate at New York University at the time of her abduction, and who stipulated, before the interview for this story, that he would not fill in any biographical details or discuss the events of the play. The matter-of-fact way that his mother speaks of that episode in her life is the same way he is forever asking actors in rehearsal to deliver lines that might otherwise seem to call for screaming or crying. (He suspects maternal influence as a possible factor in his preference for toning things down.)

To Hnath, the recording -- meticulously edited though it is -- serves as proof that he is not inventing details, and that a real person remembering severe, sustained emotional and physical stress might be subdued rather than agitated, might laugh in unexpected places, might weep only sparingly. ""I wanted that one layer of verification, of 'This is what it really sounds like,'"" he said. ""We sort of judge the legitimacy of what people are saying by how they perform it, which I think is extremely dangerous."" Of necessity, O'Connell's own performance hews to Higginbotham's expressively muted account, piped into O'Connell's skull through earbuds. Yet her portrayal is as fully realized as any other she might give, except that she has to squelch her voice while appearing to speak precisely in time with Higginbotham's. There is no room for error, because the recording plunges ahead, regardless; even her breathing must match it. It's a skill that took a few grueling months for O'Connell, 66, to learn, with the help of a lip-syncing coach, Steve Cuiffo. Hnath with his mother, Dana Higginbotham, whose abduction is recounted in the play. ""As an actor,"" she said, ""I can imagine being really interested in my interpretation of her telling this story. But this is much more my really having to surrender to her interpretation of the story, and I felt like there was a sort of purifying fire inherent in that problem, in having to lip-sync her.""

Hnath, whose oeuvre hopscotches from one form to another, was in graduate school at N.Y.U. when he developed a fascination with lip-syncing and dived into the works of the experimental theater maker Reza Abdoh. ""I went to the performing arts library every weekend and watched almost everything that they had on tape of his,"" he said. ""Even on video, you got the sense of the sort of strangeness, and that it almost feels like the performers are possessed."" Lip-syncing has an uncanny effect in ""Dana H.,"" a show that requires from O'Connell an unusual degree of isolation. Already alone onstage, she is also cut off from most of the sound of the audience. Out of town with the play, she was solitary much of the time offstage, too. So she is glad to be performing it at home in New York, where that won't be the case. On the day before the first rehearsal, she was high-spirited and funny, joking that she was in denial about how intense it was going to be. ""I think, 'Why was I so tired in Chicago? Why was it all I could do to get myself from the theater to my apartment every night? What was wrong with me?'"" She laughed. ""But I have this memory of being kind of a broken spirit and stumbling into my apartment, and I would make a nice bath of Epsom salts and watch a cooking program."" It's not a physically demanding part. Emotionally is a different matter. Knowing that this is a true story ""makes the world a darker place,"" she said. And, in O'Connell's view, the play taps into a lot about the moment we're living through, and the way that women in general -- and second-wave feminists like her in particular -- are lately looking at the world with fresh eyes.

""I felt like my toughness and my freedom were very connected to each other,"" she said, ""and I feel like this play is a lot about that. About being tough enough to find yourself in a situation that would kill a lot of people, and not die. And then you have that as a sort of badge in your life."" You also have the wounds, of course. Part of the hope of ""Dana H."" -- and, it seems, of Higginbotham -- is that it can do something to mend them. ""What she cares about a great deal,"" Hnath said, ""is how can she help those people who have undergone extraordinary trauma, how can she help them heal? So I think of myself less as telling her story than as being complicit in that mission."" He laughed to dismiss any loftiness. But O'Connell looks at ""Dana H."" as the work of a ""very feminist son"" trying to aid his powerful mother in taking care of her own trauma. And she finds that heartening. ""He's helping shepherd that,"" she said, ""and I feel like that's a good thing to be happening right now, as we try to make a very different world.""","Deirdre O'Connell has a peculiar challenge performing the recollections of Lucas Hnath's mother in his play ""Dana H.""

Media,News Networks Fall Short on Climate Story as Dolphins Die on the Beach,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/02/business/media/climate-change-news-media-red-tide-florida.html,"Ms. Gill found the first dead bottlenose dolphin of that day, wrote ""This is not normal"" in the sand below it and shared the image on Facebook Live.

NAPLES, Fla. -- Most people from the Northeast move to Florida to get out of the cold. Colleen Gill came to Naples because she heard the call of the wild. She had vacationed on this slice of coastal paradise for 20 years. She made regular jaunts to the Big Cypress National Preserve, home to cypress swamps and wild panthers. She kayaked in the Gulf. With each visit, she fell more in love. Ms. Gill and her husband own a hemp footwear company that they can manage from anywhere. So they sold their house in New Hampshire three years ago and headed down for good. Ms. Gill, 38, coveted her regular long walks on the white-sand beaches. By last summer, the walks had turned gruesome. Increasingly, there would be eels, tarpon and sea turtles dead or dying along the tide line.

Federal officials pointed to a red tide algae bloom as the culprit. Its toxins deplete seawater of oxygen and kill the sea creatures that ingest it. Red tide has killed wildlife along the Gulf Coast for centuries. But the latest bloom has been unusually persistent. It arrived over a year ago, and its effects have been extreme. Ms. Gill and others here argued that human activity had contributed to the stubborn bloom. She joined the debate on Facebook, making the case that the combined effects of sugar plantations, fertilizer runoff and warming seas were sustaining the microscopic Karenia brevis algae species and making it more lethal. Many scientists agree with that assessment, arguing that human-based nutrients and climate change are at least exacerbating the red tide and other algae blooms.

On community Facebook pages, neighbors accused Ms. Gill and others of getting worked up over nothing. The algae bloom was nature running its course, they said. Irked by the debate and concerned that the news media wasn't doing enough to cover what she was seeing on the beach, Ms. Gill, whose father was a producer for CBS News, started shooting videos with her iPhone during her morning walks. ""I started going around and filming more and more and more and more,"" she told me as we stood on the Naples pier. On Nov. 26, one of her videos went so viral that it drew the notice of The Naples Daily News and local news stations. In the video, Ms. Gill zoomed in on a six-foot-long, stiff, glistening dolphin carcass, its mouth frozen into a toothy smile. The creature was one of more than 20 dead bottlenose dolphins that had washed up on local beaches in recent days. ""This is the seventh one in 24 hours,"" Ms. Gill said through tears in the video. ""When is this going to stop?""

At roughly the same time, in Washington, President Trump told reporters outside the White House that he had doubts about the climate change report his administration had released the day after Thanksgiving.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The report warned that unmitigated global warming would take a huge economic toll on the country while causing crop failures, more extreme fires, stronger storms and, potentially, more severe algae blooms. The administration had made the report public without any effort to soften its conclusions, as the administration of George W. Bush had done with similar reports. Under President Trump, it seemed no longer necessary to spin the particulars, Coral Davenport reported for The New York Times. The administration had hit upon a new tactic that drew from lessons that Mr. Trump had learned on the campaign trail: All you have to do these days to combat facts is to declare them false. Disdain is stronger than spin.

As Steven J. Milloy, a skeptic of human-caused climate change and a member of the Trump transition team, said, there had been no need ""to stop the deep state"" from releasing the report when ""this is made-up hysteria, anyway."" Thankfully, cable news came to the rescue by making sure that those who commented on air about a report produced by scientists across 13 federal agencies were trained experts. No, wait. That's not what happened. On CNN, the former senator Rick Santorum disputed the findings with a canard: ""A lot of these scientists are driven by the money that they receive,"" he said. The network later came under fire when ""AC360"" had Mr. Santorum on again but canceled a planned interview with an author of the government report, the atmospheric scientist Katharine Hayhoe of Texas Tech University.

On NBC's ""Meet the Press,"" Danielle Pletka of the American Enterprise Institute attacked the climate change report by falsely stating, ""We need to also recognize that we just had two of the coldest years, the biggest drop in global temperatures, that we've had since the 1980s,"" although 2016 and 2017 were among the warmest years on record. My depressing Florida journey took me from the deadly beach in Naples to the other side of the state, where I met with Benjamin Kirtman, the director of the Cooperative Institute for Marine and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Miami. He suggested that television news bookers change their approach if they want to accurately reflect the debate. Citing the NASA finding that 97 percent of actively published climate scientists agree that warming trends are ""extremely likely due to human activities,"" Professor Kirtman said cable news shows should book three skeptics for every 97 nonskeptics. ""You have 97 percent of climate scientists who understand the science and know what the reality is, and then you find a podiatrist from Yahupitz who's going to tell you not to worry,"" he said. ""It's a false equivalence."" We were in his office on Virginia Key, in Miami. If human causes of climate change go unmitigated, he said, the Biscayne Bay will overcome the road here at high tide half the days of the year by 2100. Last year Miamians voted to spend some $200 million on sea walls and pumps and drains to mitigate the effects of the rising sea.

Yet despite that literal, concrete evidence, Professor Kirtman told me that a third of those he talks to about the data behind human-influenced climate change just don't buy it. So he has stopped trying to persuade that part of the population. ""They're going to have to find out for themselves,"" he said, ""when they can't sell their house."" I hadn't heard that kind of pessimism from Mr. Kirtman when I met him four years ago while covering the governor's race. I wondered whether Facebook hadn't contributed to hardening positions, with increasing talk of the ""deep state"" providing denialists with a fresh line of attack. That sort of conspiracy-mongering was part of why Ms. Gill said she had decided to post videos of the red tide carnage in Naples. She knew that in the ""fake news"" era doubters could accuse her of doctoring evidence, so she came up with a solution: ""I decided to do it on Facebook Live, so people couldn't be like, 'You made that up,'"" she told me. Still, not everyone was convinced by her posts, which have at times been met by ridicule, vitriol and ugly name-calling. On the other hand, as the arrival of television news crews suggested, she seemed to be breaking through. By the end of my time with Ms. Gill, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration declared that 42 dolphins had died in the previous 10 days. And a new emergency was breaking out. Sea birds -- including sandwich terns and common terns -- were dropping out of the sky, dying by the hundreds.

Veterinarians at the von Arx Wildlife Hospital of the Conservancy of Southwest Florida were deluged. The director, Joanna Fitzgerald, told me they weren't ready to blame red tide. Working in the reality business, they were awaiting lab results. But she added that she had never seen anything like it in 25 years. ""I don't understand the denial when there is proof of something like this affecting the animals,"" Ms. Fitzgerald said. ""I mean, you can't keep denying it."" After a pause, she added, ""I mean, obviously, you can. Because people are.""","A crusader films the red-tide carnage in Florida.

Art & Design,Why Rem Koolhaas Brought a Tractor to the Guggenheim,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/arts/design/rem-koolhaas-guggenheim.html,"Rem Koolhaas at the Koppert Cress greenhouse in the Netherlands, a space related to his new exhibition, ""Countryside, The Future,"" at the Guggenheim.Credit...Jussi Puikkonen for The New York Times



Rem Koolhaas at the Koppert Cress greenhouse in the Netherlands, a space related to his new exhibition, ""Countryside, The Future,"" at the Guggenheim.

THE HAGUE -- A manifesto and love letter to the city in the 1970s, the book ""Delirious New York"" helped propel the reputation of a young, restless Dutch journalist-and-screenwriter-turned-architect. Nearly forgotten now, a display of drawings accompanied the book in 1978 -- real and also wonderfully imaginary views of the city by the author, Rem Koolhaas, and his colleagues at the Office for Metropolitan Architecture, or OMA, the architecture firm founded a few years earlier by him, Madelon Vriesendorp, and Elia and Zoe Zenghelis to develop what they called ""a mutant form of urbanism."" ""The Sparkling Metropolis,"" as the show was called, occupied what then doubled as storage rooms at the top of the spiral of the Guggenheim Museum. ""The irony wasn't lost on me,"" Mr. Koolhaas remembered the other day, about the fact that Frank Lloyd Wright, the Guggenheim's architect, hated cities. We had gotten together in the Rotterdam offices of OMA. I had come to the Netherlands to talk with Mr. Koolhaas about the new Guggenheim exhibition he has put together -- a bookend to ""Delirious New York"" and, in a sense, to his career.

A corrective to the focus on growing cities, ""Countryside"" aims to turn a spotlight on the 98 percent of the planet not yet occupied by cities. Anticipating the obvious criticism, Mr. Koolhaas describes the show as a ""pointillist"" portrait, a ""global sampling"" of ""the current condition of 'countryside,'"" which he acknowledges seems ""a glaringly inadequate term for all the territory that is not urban."" By not-urban territory, in other words, Mr. Koolhaas means farms and wilderness and oceans and villages -- the Kalahari, the Great Barrier Reef and the Dakotas -- but also dense exurban clusters of high-tech industrial sites and mega-campuses for Amazon fulfillment centers and Tesla giga-factories in places like the high desert outside Reno, Nevada.

The show pings from urbanizing villages in Kenya along Chinese-funded train routes, to endangered communities in Siberia where climate change is hastening the melt of permafrost. There's a bit about satellites supplying real-time data to computer-driven tractors plowing immense mono-farms in Middle America; another about M-Pesa, a mobile-phone-based money-transfer system funding businesses in remote parts of Tanzania. And a bay in the Guggenheim rotunda is devoted to Iraqi, Syrian and other immigrants resuscitating ghost towns like Camini, in Calabria, Italy, and the village of Manheim, near Cologne, Germany. Years in gestation, the show is the collective output of an army of collaborators and students. Troy Conrad Therrien, the Guggenheim's curator for architecture, brought Mr. Koolhaas onboard in 2015 and oversaw the project's development. Among many others, Mr. Koolhaas teamed with Samir Bantal, who runs AMO, the research arm of OMA, and Niklas Maak, the excellent German architecture critic. Graphics for the museum layout and for the dense, palm-size catalog are by Irma Boom, the great Dutch book designer. The catalog's size is a kind of inside joke. Mr. Koolhaas is famous for producing doorstops. He takes no clear political position on many of the hot-button topics the show raises, portraying himself as a reporter not pundit, realist not cynic, equally amazed and appalled, refusing moral judgments or virtue signaling. A familiar pose by him, it may confuse some, frustrate others. The topics evolved out of ""a personal journey, where our energies led us,"" he told me.

The company's pony-tailed owner, Rob Baan, greeted us at the door. In a hothouse off the lobby he fed us samples of tiny chrysanthemums, shiso leaves and a flower whose name I failed to catch that he said was used in toothpaste, which instantly anesthetized my mouth for several troubling minutes. Mr. Baan then led us through airlock doors into the iridescent greenhouses. A dozen-odd years ago, the United Nations announced that this is the first urban century, the first time more than half the world's population lives in cities. Predictions were that some 70 percent of humans will be urban-dwellers by 2050. Having been left for dead a generation ago, cities suddenly became the next big thing. Books and biennials about cities flooded the architecture world. As Mr. Koolhaas says, the focus on urbanism ""gave people the right to ignore the countryside,"" incubating a ""reservoir of indignation"" -- although it's not quite clear whom he means by people. The people who turned out for Trump and Brexit certainly never forgot about themselves. Along which lines, this is the sort of show that may invite charges of slumming by a world-famous architect who, it is said, often gives off the imperious, slightly impatient impression that he has something better to do. At 75, tall and imposing, given to a uniform of gray and black slacks and mock turtlenecks, he can seem almost comically restless. When I chat with his friend Ms. Boom, a warm, exuberant character, before we all head out for a Japanese dinner in Amsterdam, he paces her house like a caged tiger.

He can be gruff, too, but also solicitous and generous, amusing like his prose, with a seemingly depthless appetite for new ideas and people. It says something that OMA has been an incubator for so many gifted architects, Zaha Hadid, Jeanne Gang and Sarah Whiting among them. The firm has a lot of other people overseeing projects around the world these days, which has left Mr. Koolhaas more time to ponder the Guggenheim exhibition. He traces the roots of the exhibition to walks that he took years ago around the Swiss village near St. Moritz where he and his partner and sometime collaborator, the British-born Dutch architect Petra Blaisse, used to holiday. He noticed the population dropping, the town growing; cows, horses and farmers giving way to immigrant domestic workers from Southeast Asia and absentee owners from Milan who spent millions of euros converting old barns into minimalist villas. He identified gentrification, in other words. This is what piqued his interest in the other 98 percent.

""Yes, there is something inherently ridiculous about suddenly realizing the rest of the world exists,"" he admits. But he says he learned years ago from a journalistic mentor to approach new situations as if he were a Martian, with an innocence that may appear clueless but also lets one notice what others no longer see because it has become too familiar. Mr. Therrien, the Guggenheim curator, puts it this way in the catalog: ""The countryside has long -- always? -- been chock-full of experts, overflowing with opinions, flooded by interpretations. But Martian strategy is necessarily unimpressed. Even the duly picked-over can be a rich harvest. Calling it ignored is not ignorant, it's strategic. It's an opening.""

That's the hope, anyway -- that ""Countryside,"" whatever criticism it provokes, ignites debate, gets people to think about developments and places that demand attention because city and country, urban and rural, are ultimately not separate issues. The show includes no buildings by OMA. The designer of the Seattle Public Library and the national library in Qatar, among other recent landmarks, makes clear that this exhibition is not about his architecture. It's useful to remember that Mr. Koolhaas started out his working career writing for a weekly in The Hague, honing a journalist's curiosity and detachment and penchant for pronouncements. He fell in with a faction of the Dutch avant-garde that wasn't so much political as ironic, camp, modernist; and like his father, he also wrote screenplays, including a film noir and an unproduced script for Russ Meyer. Montage became a motif running through his books, exhibitions and buildings. ""Countryside"" unspools along the rotunda montage-style, ideas and eras speeding by, figures unearthed like the German architect Herman Sorgel who, during the 1920s, cooked up a scheme to link Africa with Europe by lowering the Mediterranean 100 meters, irrigating the Sahara and installing new hydroelectric dams in Gibraltar and Suez to power the new continent, which he called Atlantropa. Atlantropa appears in the show alongside Stalin's and Mao's megalomaniacal plans for remaking the countryside, and also with the Great Green Wall, the African Union's current and far more benign attempt to transform a 4,700-mile-long, transcontinental swath of desert into arable land.

Through those airlock doors at Koppert Cress, the greenhouses looked like something out of ""Ad Astra"": silent spaces the length and breadth of New York avenue blocks, their atmosphere monitored like operating theaters, plants stretching as far as the eye could see in gridded rows beneath red, green or white lights. In the room of plants enveloped by a Dan Flavinesque pink light, I asked Mr. Koolhaas whether he found the greenhouse peaceful or stressful. ""Definitely stressful,"" he said, then added, ""and fantastically beautiful."" Places likes these are Mr. Koolhaas's big architectural reveal in ""Countryside."" What he calls ""post-human"" buildings -- whose boredom he finds ""hypnotic"" and ""banality breathtaking"" -- represent, he says, a ""new sublime."" He is referring to the expanding universe of data collection hubs, storage hangers and other digital-era behemoths that, like Koppert Cress, are reshaping the hinterlands. Designed by codes and algorithms, not human inspiration, industrial facilities on this scale, once upon a time, employed hundreds or thousands of workers. Now, like Koppert Cress, they're staffed by two dozen or so, with implications that ""Countryside"" doesn't get much into. For Mr. Koolhaas, the architecture is, like 1970s New York, a kind of revelation, calamity and unfolding experiment. A new manifesto. ""To drop the connection between humanism and architecture is of course extremely frightening,"" Mr. Koolhaas tells me when we leave Koppert Cress. ""But it is also exhilarating.""","The architect, a champion of cities, now turns a spotlight on the countryside in a sprawling new exhibition about the other 98 percent of the world.",35261404-046e-5cf8-aeef-3c93bec3cb43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/20/arts/20koolhaas4/20koolhaas4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b93058003cada0b94355f1aee25bfee23f4b1376a65bdbfe4f55a84a7e39ec4d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"One of the vast greenhouses in Koppert Cress, whose facility is the size of 23 football fields.",35261404-046e-5cf8-aeef-3c93bec3cb43,N24News/imgs/35261404-046e-5cf8-aeef-3c93bec3cb43.jpg,14
Food,Hot Enough for You? Try Eating Something Even Hotter,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/dining/chicken-soup-samgyetang-recipe.html,"There are less daunting methods to beat the summer heat than by wolfing down still-boiling chicken soup for lunch. But followers of a Korean tradition say that few are as effective.

Their mantra is ""yi yeol chi yeol,"" or ""fight fire with fire,"" and their weapon of choice is samgyetang, a whole young chicken or Cornish hen stuffed with glutinous rice, ginseng root, red dates and garlic, served piping hot in its own broth.

At the peak of summer, and especially on ""sambok,"" the three days of the year Koreans believe to be the hottest, according to the lunar calendar, many of them seek out roiling bowls of samgyetang in the belief that it replenishes nutrients, improves circulation and helps balance the body's internal and external temperatures.

""The concepts that make it good for you on a hot day are rooted in traditional Korean medicine and are very old,"" said Maangchi Kim, the Korean-Canadian cookbook author and YouTube star. Her video on making samgyetang has been viewed more than 1.4 million times.","On summer scorchers, Korean tradition calls for a boiling bowl of chicken, rice and ginseng that's believed to work better than anything cold.",467b7525-6d60-5650-9d76-55516c5d9e82,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/dining/26HOT1/19HOT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ad39fb778cd427782928e214e41f7849ddede9f426d567821d77df72f8b66c74&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Korean dish samgyetang, a stuffed young chicken in a piping-hot broth, is popular on steamy summer days.",467b7525-6d60-5650-9d76-55516c5d9e82,N24News/imgs/467b7525-6d60-5650-9d76-55516c5d9e82.jpg,17
Health,Marijuana and Vaping Are More Popular Than Cigarettes Among Teenagers,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/health/teen-drug-smoking.html,"Marijuana and Vaping Are More Popular Than Cigarettes Among Teenagers

Cigarette smoking has dropped so sharply among American teenagers that vaping and marijuana use are now more common, according to a national survey of adolescent drug use released Thursday. The report, sponsored by the federal government's National Institute on Drug Abuse and administered by the University of Michigan, found that 22.9 percent of high school seniors said they had used marijuana within the previous 30 days and 16.6 percent had used a vaping device. Only 9.7 percent had smoked cigarettes. The survey of 43,703 eighth-, 10th- and 12th-grade students in public and private schools nationwide raised concerns about the popularity of vaping devices, available in countless styles to appeal to different social groups. But it was otherwise optimistic. It found that teenagers' consumption of most substances -- including alcohol, tobacco, prescription opioids and stimulants -- has either fallen or held steady at last year's levels, the lowest rates in 20 years. By contrast, rates of marijuana use have remained largely consistent, with occasional small shifts, in recent years. (Studies show, however, that marijuana rates have risen among young adults in the last decade.)

""We're impressed by the improvement in substance use by all teenagers,"" said Dr. Wilson Compton, deputy director of the institute. Still, Dr. Compton continued, ""we don't yet know about the health problems in vaping."" Vaping devices, which typically vaporize substances into an inhalant, are perceived by some experts as a healthier alternative to traditional cigarettes because they do not include carcinogens that come with burning tobacco. But Dr. Compton said, ""The concern is that it may represent a new route for exposure to nicotine and marijuana."" The devices are typically sold with nicotine. But when 12th-graders were asked what they believed was in the mist they had vaped most recently, 51.8 percent said ""just flavoring."" When asked about use in the past month, one in 20 12th-graders said they had used marijuana in vaping devices and one in 10 said nicotine. Cassie Poncelow, a school counselor at Poudre High School in Fort Collins, Colo., has noticed an upsurge in vaping across all social groups. ""We're seeing a ton of it,"" she said. The devices are readily accessible and easy to conceal, she added.

""Kids are taking hits on their vape pens in the hallways and nobody notices,"" Ms. Poncelow said, noting that some devices resemble flash drives, which students plug into laptops to recharge. But educators and public health officials praised the drop in tobacco use. Dr. Compton noted that in 1996, 10.4 percent of eighth graders reported smoking cigarettes daily. By 2017, that figure fell to 0.6 percent. In 1997, daily smoking among 12th graders peaked at 24.6 percent. By 2017, only 4.2 percent smoked cigarettes daily. Thomas J. Glynn, a former director of cancer science at the American Cancer Society and an adjunct lecturer at Stanford University School of Medicine, hailed the continuing tobacco decline as ""an astounding accomplishment in public health."" ""But,"" he added, ""it doesn't mean we close the door and go home now."" While noting that the data on vaping devices as a gateway to cigarettes is inconclusive, he added, ""I think we have to have alarms out."" Dr. Compton attributed the tobacco decline to many factors, including strong public health antismoking campaigns, higher cigarette prices and peer pressure not to smoke. Students in all grade levels reported that they viewed cigarettes and alcohol as distasteful and a serious health risk. Similar explanations have been given for dropping rates of alcohol use, especially binge drinking. Students have become more self-conscious about the possibility of their drunken images being posted on social media, experts say, which can tarnish reputations and college eligibility. But marijuana? Not so much. In the report, only 14.1 percent of 12th graders said they saw a ""great risk"" from smoking marijuana occasionally. In 1991, 40.6 percent of seniors held that view. In 2017, nearly 24 percent of students in all three grades said they had used marijuana over the past year, a rate that has stayed relatively stable in recent years.

Allison Kilcoyne, who directs a health center at a high school in a Boston suburb, has seen firsthand the evidence of the survey's marijuana findings. Persuading students about marijuana's risk is tricky, said Ms. Kilcoyne, a family nurse practitioner, especially in a state that permits medical marijuana. ""They perceive there are no negative effects,"" Ms. Kilcoyne said. ""I talk about the impact on their developing brain and the risk of learning to smoke marijuana as a coping mechanism. We have other interventions, I say. But the problem is that for them, it works. They're feeling immediate relief of whatever symptoms they have. They're medicating themselves."" Yet while marijuana use among high school seniors has not declined, it has also not increased in recent years. Given that fewer students hold marijuana in disregard, researchers are perplexed but relieved that use of marijuana has not kept pace with attitudes toward it. ""Drug use tends to go hand in hand with perceptions of risk and approval,"" said Ty S. Schepis, an associate professor of psychology at Texas State University who studies adolescent and young adult drug use. But approving of marijuana may not necessarily translate in such a manner, he said. ""I've had friends who like to go sky diving. I would never go sky diving. There are certain activities that we may quietly condone or tacitly approve, even though the majority still may not want to engage in it.""","The latest national survey of adolescent drug use found declining use of most substances, including alcohol, tobacco, prescription opioids and stimulants.",4b9fe7cf-e612-5ebb-8422-a16e2c0d99c4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/14/science/14TEENDRUGS/14TEENDRUGS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=27953700b09050d41f59a2e1e8ab62d072408d5e51ec748387cc652cd5b3e9b1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Juul brand e-cigarette, which resembles a flash drive, is popular among underage vapers.

Movies,'The Weasels' Tale' Review: House Hunting,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/10/movies/the-weasels-tale-review.html,"The housemate dysfunction might be sad if it wasn't played for laughs. Mara is frozen in her starry past, and Norberto and Martin treat her and Pedro with self-aggrandizing nostalgia or contempt. But Campanella, who directed the Oscar-winning 2010 thriller ""The Secret in Their Eyes,"" sets up a routine of look-at-them-go one-upmanship. Would-be villains Barbara and Francisco look plain by comparison. (The older actors are fixtures of Argentine cinema, and the movie remakes a 1976 premise; Mundstock, who died in April, was a well-liked humorist.)

Norberto and Martin, professional cynics, spin their own plots to stymie the young swindlers, and the movie leans on our delectation in this. The Grand Guignol conclusion does fulfill the flair promised by the film's tuned-up colors and by Mara's vintage posters for her movies, which have glorious titles like ""The Other Woman Forever."" There's an attempt to reinvigorate the romance between Mara and Pedro, but that pales next to the bad behavior of their less savory companions. You can't keep a good weasel down.

Television,Danai Gurira Was 'Amazed' by Sunday's 'The Walking Dead',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/arts/television/the-walking-dead-michonne.html,"This interview includes spoilers for Sunday night's episode of ""The Walking Dead."" We find ourselves in an empty new world. People have retreated to their homes, and out in the streets the sight of some lone person shuffling toward you is cause for alarm -- keeping your distance is crucial. Is this real life ... or is it just ""The Walking Dead""? The parallels are hard to overlook. With its ghost-town cities and post-apocalyptic mood, AMC's popular zombie thriller is littered with references to the ruinous disease that ended the Time Before (""Clean Hands Protect Lives"" reads a cautioning poster we see in Sunday's episode of the show) that now seem familiar. And while the lead actress Danai Gurira, who plays the katana queen Michonne, didn't want to trivialize the ongoing coronavirus crisis by connecting it to the dark fantasy of a TV show, she, too, is unsettled. ""There's nothing quite like facing a pandemic,"" Gurira said in a recent interview. ""I've never experienced anything like this moment in our time on earth, and we're still in the middle of it, you know? It's a real moment-by-moment situation, which does relate to our show's themes -- the struggles that people are having, the tragedies, and the ways that we move forward and get through this together, as a society."" The society we've been immersed in on ""The Walking Dead"" for the last decade is now losing one longtime member. In Sunday's Season 10 episode, ""What We Become,"" Michonne takes her leave of the show, almost exactly eight years after her first appearance in the closing moments of Season 2. She was the mysterious hooded figure who rescued an endangered Andrea (Laurie Holden) by slicing through the undead as two docile ""walker"" pets stood behind her in chains -- a startling entrance that signaled the arrival of a fierce warrior.

Over the years, Michonne has become more complex: We've seen her vulnerable side, her romantic side, even her maternal side as she became the devoted mother of an adopted daughter, Judith, and her biological son RJ. That human dimension deepens further on Sunday's show, in a sequence in which a tripping Michonne reimagines a series of events from her past, suggesting what her life might have been like if she'd joined Team Negan (led by Jeffrey Dean Morgan), before discovering concrete evidence that her former lover, Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) was still alive, and out there ... somewhere. Michonne's exit from ""The Walking Dead"" will leave her children in the care of Uncle Daryl (Norman Reedus), and could free the character to pursue and maybe eventually reunite with Grimes, whose story will be continuing in planned films. The character's departure frees Gurira, who's also an esteemed playwright, to devote more time to her literary career. She's also the showrunner of HBO Max's limited-series adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's novel ""Amerikanah."" ""It's bittersweet,"" Gurira said of leaving ""The Walking Dead"" after all these years. ""But it's time for me to go on other journeys."" During a phone interview, Gurira talked about Michonne's alternative reality, the need for female leadership to be dramatized, and what she won't miss about ""The Walking Dead."" Here are edited excerpts from the conversation. What did you think about Michonne's final episode, where we get to see the life she might have led if she'd never helped Andrea? That was new! It has a ""Sliding Doors"" component, doesn't it? I never imagined stepping into this alternative reality for the character, going back to the beginning and remembering who she is and how that affects the choices she makes in the present day -- right up to her last choice at the end of the episode. It was fascinating, playing those moments of who she could have so easily become. She was very dislocated from her humanity when she met Andrea, and there was something about Andrea that made her decide to not do what she does in this alternate scenario. It was trippy -- in the literal and the storytelling sense.

I think what I've enjoyed most about this job is that every year there's stuff that you've never done before. Even back when Rick was gone, and then within the next episode, Michonne had a son. And that's why I'm finding it hard to leave, because I always knew that year after year, there was going to be something challenging that would stretch me. They walked me through this last episode long before I got the script. But I wasn't sure how it was going to work out until today, when I finally saw it. It was chilling to watch. And I don't even know how they did some of that. I mean, all of the stuff where you see Michonne making a different choice, that's new footage. But they blended old footage with new footage in an impressive way. I was quite amazed.

Well, all I'll say is, I've been part of ""The Walking Dead"" franchise and the Marvel movie franchise, and I've been taught to not talk about things. I'm not saying it is or it isn't happening. But I think it would be very cool to see this world open up in a way that you can do through a movie exploration. There are a lot of stories to tell that you can't get to when you're following a certain narrative in a TV show. But there are all these other narratives that are like, ""Oh, wouldn't that be interesting?"" It's extremely exciting. If she's not continuing in the franchise films, this episode closes her chapter. And she's inspired so many people. I think for all the women on our show, there's been a lot of power. You've seen a lot of female characters grow into their power and leadership and their ability to hold their own in whatever circumstances. I don't know how often you see that. I'm a feminist, and I advocate women's leadership, and I loved that shaking up society results in unabashed female leadership, at least in our show. We would benefit from further exploring that in the real world. That's something we have been deprived of, quite honestly. Michonne was very much someone I had to step up to, especially when she started to grow into herself and step away from her demons. When she became an item with Rick, Michonne was kind of more cool, and Rick was hot. The way she handles and assesses and comes to clarity about things -- I've always said, she's smarter than me, she's faster than me, and she's stronger than me. So I had to step into her agility and power. I always felt like I could learn from her as a woman, you know? When you were first learning how to be Michonne, didn't you practice her sword moves on your theater colleagues during the production of your play ""The Convert""?

I was in the basement of the Kirk Douglas Theatre in Culver City, and I had a practice sword made of wood. So I would be talking about the language components of the play while learning how to move my body with the sword. It was on my mind all the time. I felt like I needed to become one with ... not only with the character, but with how she moves and how her weapon moves in her hand. I create black female characters, and I'd never imagined a woman like this. So I wanted to give her my all, to do her justice. I would practice with the sword during every break, and I would constantly go back to the trainer to learn more. It was never, ""Oh, I'm great at this now."" It was a constant learning curve.

You're about to face another learning curve as a first-time showrunner. What lessons will you take from ""The Walking Dead"" -- any dos or don'ts? One of my goals is to show love and respect for the behind-the-scenes crew that most people don't get to see. Everyone's job on a show is so, so important. And I saw that attitude in action on ""The Walking Dead."" What do I not want? I don't want to do a tick check every night. I don't miss the ticks. Or the Georgia heat. It's such an important component of the show, to be in that environment, but we were literally sweating buckets and running through woods covered in gnats. There were times where it would be so hot, you'd be like, ""Am I about to faint?"" They were a little concerned, because I had been exerting myself, I was panting a little, and I had a new wig. But honestly, the heat of Georgia was a character in the show. There was nothing convenient about the world that those characters are in, you know? The dire circumstances are somewhat metaphorical. The show is metaphorically so many things -- the situations that these characters are going through and the way their lives can be completely altered by things unforeseen. That's something that definitely resonated for me. I created a play called ""Eclipsed,"" about Liberian women in a war zone, and all the things that happen to women in war zones -- how it affected them and their humanity and how they couldn't predict who they were going to become. And I started to connect it to ""The Walking Dead"" in the sense that Michonne felt like a woman in a war zone, and it raised the same question: Who did she have to become? It's about the choices you make in dire circumstances, when your humanity is tested and you have to fight for it. That's the core of the show -- the fight for your soul. It definitely resonates with the myriad unimaginable things that happen to human beings.","The actress, who stars as Michonne on the zombie thriller, discussed this week's episode and the future of her character.",c28cbbd6-d523-5ff6-9917-07af97947bfb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/arts/22danai1/22danai1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=bfa863f96e8c961651854f50d0a692b4d4b1e79721561804187300bf19303182&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Danai Gurira as Michonne in ""The Walking Dead.""",c28cbbd6-d523-5ff6-9917-07af97947bfb,N24News/imgs/c28cbbd6-d523-5ff6-9917-07af97947bfb.jpg,3
Your Money,Notre-Dame Donation Backlash Raises Debate: What's Worthy of Philanthropy?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/26/your-money/notre-dame-donation-backlash-philanthropy.html,"As flames engulfed Notre-Dame, people from around the world opened their wallets and began making donations. Within two days, nearly $1 billion was raised to help pay for the restoration of the 856-year-old cathedral in Paris. The charitable response was a reflection of Notre-Dame's stature as a cherished monument of French cultural heritage. Some benefactors pledged more than $100 million each, including Francois-Henri Pinault, whose wealth comes from luxury brands like Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, and Bernard Arnault, the richest person in Europe and chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH. But the outpouring met with resistance as critics wondered why tragedies like the incineration of the National Museum of Brazil in Rio de Janeiro in September did not receive the same degree of support. And it rekindled class resentment in a city already racked by the so-called Yellow Vest movement, a populist response to economic inequality in France that tapped into a rising global movement against the concentration of wealth. Some criticism was aimed at donors for not paying their fair share in taxes and thus depriving the French government of the revenue to repair Notre-Dame itself. Others denounced the reputational boost bestowed on philanthropists at a time of national tragedy. And some attacked the premise of giving so much to a damaged cathedral when that money could better benefit social service organizations that could provide food, shelter or a better education to needy citizens.

But philanthropic experts and advisers said they were not shocked by what seemed like an ungrateful response. ""It's not surprising,"" said Nicolas Berggruen, a billionaire philanthropist who founded the Berggruen Institute in Los Angeles, which aims to reshape political and social institutions to develop long-term solutions to society's challenges. ""In the age of anxiety, people will look to accuse lots of different groups for all of the evil or some of the evil. Rich people for sure fall into this. Philanthropists are an extension of that."" Others took a less philosophical approach, saying that for society to be most effective, philanthropists need to work with government and the private sector, not alone or in opposition to them. ""Instead of praising the act of philanthropy itself, people are saying it's not the highest and best use of that capital,"" said Nick Tedesco, senior philanthropic adviser at J.P. Morgan Private Bank. ""When did we get to a place where we feel comfortable criticizing other people's altruism?""

Those who are worried about the backlash think anger over unequal distribution of wealth is bleeding into the wrong areas. ""There's a lot of understandable concern about wealth inequality and a lot of concern about the bad behavior of some,"" said Phil Buchanan, chief executive of the Center for Effective Philanthropy and the author of ""Giving Done Right."" ""But I worry that we're conflating concerns over our approach to taxation with a critique of philanthropy, and I don't actually follow the logic,"" he added. ""I don't believe most big philanthropists are motivated by a desire to maintain the status quo via their giving or to protect themselves from higher taxation."" He said private philanthropic organizations like the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation supported ideas that had become part of the social fabric, like the 911 emergency system and the field of nurse practitioners. And the Libra Foundation, which is backed by a part of the Pritzker family, supplied $350,000 in grants to organizations addressing the needs of families being separated at the United States-Mexico border. Mr. Buchanan said that to solve social problems, all three sectors of society -- public, private and philanthropic -- needed to do the jobs they were meant to do at a high level, not be sidetracked by a backlash. ""What I'm more concerned about is the broad-brush critique of the whole concept of giving and the under-appreciation of all the good giving has done,"" he said. ""We need a healthy civil society doing different things.""

Mr. Tedesco had a different concern: that already too much money earmarked for philanthropy was not being put to use. ""With Notre-Dame, you were able to tap into otherwise dormant philanthropic capital,"" he said. ""But that leads to the question: Why is philanthropic capital lying idle? The nonprofit organizations don't know how to compel donors to give."" Instead of shying from criticism, philanthropists should accept it as the cost of trying out new things that may not work, Mr. Tedesco said. ""You should be more willing to own that criticism because it shows you're attempting to find solutions or approaches that will ultimately get to success."" But for those who would rather avoid backlash, anonymity is always an option. Caroline W. Hodkinson, director of philanthropic advisory at Bessemer Trust, said some of the firm's wealthiest clients were opting to use limited liability companies to hold money that was earmarked for philanthropy but that could also be used for impact investing. The investment vehicles give donors greater flexibility over how the money is managed, but they also provide near-total anonymity.

But anonymity presents a problem because of its inherent lack of transparency. ""I'm concerned about the anonymity issue,"" said Lawson Bader, chief executive of DonorsTrust, a donor-advised fund. Knowing who a benefactor is helps build trust, he said, whereas anonymity can hide potential conflicts. For instance, museums are re-examining gifts from the Sackler family, a prominent donor in the art world, after its involvement in the opioid crisis became known. Had the donations been made anonymously, they would not be under scrutiny now. Some critics hope that the backlash goes beyond assessing the merits of certain donors and donations and instead forces a wholesale re-evaluation of philanthropy. Anand Giridharadas, author of ""Winners Take All: The Elite Charade of Changing the World,"" said he found the criticism of the donations to Notre-Dame healthy and wanted to see more of it. ""I've been advocating for exactly that kind of reaction,"" he said. ""It is not hostility to giving. It's simply an injection of skepticism about this kind of exertion of power."" When philanthropists, particularly in the tech world, make sweeping pronouncements like Mark Zuckerberg's $3 billion plan to cure all disease, Mr. Giridharadas said, society needs to tone down its adulation and be skeptical. Mr. Giridharadas said he would like to see philanthropists make gifts instead to organizations that shake up the social order. ""The kind of giving I advocate is 'being a traitor to your class' giving,"" he said. Unlike Mr. Giridharadas, who supports shaking up norms, Mr. Berggruen is focused on helping democracies work better by drawing on the best philanthropic traditions. ""What philanthropists have done in America is much more to put their money to use in society,"" he said. ""The state has a role, but Bill Gates can take more risk than the private sector can and take different kinds of risk than the state can take. In America, on the whole, that's been beneficial."" Aside from the backlash, the debate stirred by the donations to Notre-Dame has also raised hope. ""The takeaway form Notre-Dame is, if that can happen in 24 hours, the resources are there to take on major issues,"" said Rob Hansen, founder of Goodnation, which measures the impact of donations. ""Imagine instead of redirecting that billion dollars, we raise another billion dollars to other causes.""","Philanthropic experts said they were not shocked by what seemed like an ungrateful response to the money raised to restore the cathedral, but few agreed on a solution.",7c584654-cabf-5857-9f6d-18dc01bbdeb6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/26/business/26wealth1/26wealth1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=246974fc23d91a0c16be419bdfa93d8daab9c88b4d05eaa22df0ca6cb57200f1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Nearly $1 billion was raised in two days to help pay for the restoration of Notre-Dame after it was scarred by an extensive fire.,7c584654-cabf-5857-9f6d-18dc01bbdeb6,N24News/imgs/7c584654-cabf-5857-9f6d-18dc01bbdeb6.jpg,21
Health,"Daily Low-Dose Aspirin No Longer Recommended by Doctors, if You're Healthy",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/18/health/aspirin-health.html,"For years, low-dose aspirin has been described as a panacea to ward off heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular disease. New guidelines, though, suggest that aspirin should not be prescribed to most adults who are in good cardiovascular health and that the risk of internal bleeding often outweighs the benefit.

The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association released the new guidelines on Sunday. They come on the heels of studies released last year that said daily low-dose aspirin -- 100 milligrams or less -- did not help older adults who do not have cardiovascular disease. Those results, published in three articles in The New England Journal of Medicine, surprised physicians and patients alike who for years believed aspirin would prevent any number of heart-related ills.

The authors of the new guidelines said low-dose aspirin should not be routinely given as a preventive measure to adults 70 years and older or to any adult who has an increased risk of bleeding.

""The guidelines are for people with no clinical signs of heart disease or stroke,"" said one of the authors, Dr. Erin Michos, the associate director of preventive cardiology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, in an interview on Monday.",New guidelines suggest the risk of bleeding outweighs the heart benefits among healthy adults who take low-dose aspirin.,0f0dffc1-12c6-5e99-b903-f0b9a42e45c7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/26/us/18xp-ASPIRIN/18xp-ASPIRIN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ed9c30973fe566f2467f172ee804b182736b23433835260c807880ed9a9cd019&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,New guidelines suggest low-dose aspirin should not be recommended to prevent heart attacks in healthy older adults.,0f0dffc1-12c6-5e99-b903-f0b9a42e45c7,N24News/imgs/0f0dffc1-12c6-5e99-b903-f0b9a42e45c7.jpg,1
Science,An Advance May Double the Capabilities of Fiber Optics,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/26/science/faster-fiber-optic-transmissions-reported-by-researchers.html,"Researchers have announced an advance that could double the capacity of fiber-optic circuits, potentially opening the way for networks to carry more data over long distances while significantly reducing their cost. Writing in the journal Science on Thursday, electrical engineers at the University of California, San Diego proposed a way to extend the range that beams of laser light in fiber-optic glass wires can travel and, in theory, achieve that dramatic improvement. One way to understand the challenge of sending data through fiber-optic circuits is to imagine a person shouting to someone else down a long corridor. As the listener moves farther away, the words become fainter and more difficult to discern as they echo off the walls. A similar challenge confronts the designers of networks that carry data. Beams of laser light packed densely in fiber-optic glass wires need to be both amplified and recreated at regular intervals to send them thousands of miles. The process of converting the optical ones from light to electricity and then back again is a significant part of the cost of these networks. The process also limits how much data they can carry.

In its report, the group described a way to ""predistort"" the data that is transmitted via laser beams so that it can be deciphered easily over great distances. This is done by creating, in effect, guardrails for the light beams with a device known as a frequency comb -- using very precise and evenly spaced signals -- to encode the information before it is transmitted. That has the effect of embedding a digital watermark in the original data, making it possible to transmit data accurately over much longer distances and dispense with the need to perform optical-to-electronic conversions at relatively short intervals. The researchers said they had set a transmission record for a fiber-optic message, sending it more than 7,400 miles in a laboratory experiment without having to regenerate the signal. That experiment is not discussed in the just-published paper. The research, which has been supported in part by Google and Sumitomo Electric Industries, a maker of fiber-optic cables, is a step closer to the vision of an ""all-optical network,"" according to Nikola Alic, one of the authors of the paper and a research scientist in the Photonics Laboratory of the California Institute for Telecommunications and Information Technologies at the University of California, San Diego.

Such a network would be significantly less expensive and could carry more data. So far, the researchers have been able to increase the power of the lasers twentyfold to achieve transmissions over far greater distances, he said. Until now, increasing the power of the laser signal in current fiber-optic networks has been analogous to moving in quicksand -- the more you increase the power, the greater the challenge of interference and distortion. ""The more you struggle, the worse off you are,"" Mr. Alic said. Bart Stuck, a venture capitalist at Signal Lake Management and a former Bell Laboratories scientist who conducted research in signal processing, said of the new paper, ""This is great engineering."" Similar ideas were used in an earlier era of communications, he noted. Although the concept was used in the world of analog voice communications, the U.C. San Diego researchers have pushed the ideas into the optical communications world. ""Their contribution is doing this at gigabits per second,"" Mr. Stuck said. Other optical scientists were more skeptical about the prospects for the new approach. ""This is very interesting research, but there will be challenges applying this approach in the real world,"" said Alan Huang, a former researcher at Bell Labs who has worked extensively with the ""Kerr Effect,"" a physical phenomenon that distorts optical signals, which the San Diego researchers are trying to overcome. ""Their results will be more or less effective depending on the type of data transmitted."" Optical networks emerged during the 1980s as a faster and higher-capacity alternative to copper-wire-based communications. Their ability to carry vast amounts of data has been further increased by encoding multiple streams of data in different frequencies or ""colors"" in the same beam of light. Because the signal needs to be both amplified and regenerated at regular intervals over long distances, power for the computers that make the conversion between light and electrical data is required. Each conversion step also introduces a brief delay, or ""latency."" The new research suggests a path that effectively eliminates the regeneration over long distances.","A group of electrical engineers says that sending information in a new fashion could, in theory, double the capacity of fiber-optic circuits.",eeb9dbcf-2a34-58fc-b729-f27264a5d9ed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/26/business/26fiber-web1/26fiber-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=545133cae35665b3840eed35b7d3e1e9ed7a2e6e50b8d57b941d9fa4d2df28fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A frequency comb, which transmits signals at precise, evenly spaced frequencies, helps decipher data that is transmitted via laser beams over great distances.",eeb9dbcf-2a34-58fc-b729-f27264a5d9ed,N24News/imgs/eeb9dbcf-2a34-58fc-b729-f27264a5d9ed.jpg,2
Music,Can the Mainstream Catch Up to Rico Nasty?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/26/arts/music/rico-nasty-nightmare-vacation.html,"When the rapper Rico Nasty talks about falling in love at first sight, she doesn't mean with an individual, but with a feeling. She's talking about her first time on a real stage, and not even as a performer, but as a hanger-on in the wings. Still, that night, everything was moving in dreamy slow motion. Nasty, now 23, had cautiously started releasing songs on SoundCloud around the time she finished high school in 2015, but she was still bashful about her dreams of becoming a rapper when the upstart teen sensation Lil Yachty invited her to a show. Even back then, when she was just Maria Kelly, a teenager from the Palmer Park neighborhood of Prince George's County, Md., Nasty was a charismatic cutup, and she'd caught Yachty's attention with her high jinks on Vine and Twitter. But standing up there behind him -- ""like a groupie, HA-HA!"" she recalled recently -- as the crowd went insane, something clicked for her.

She took a video of the crowd that night on her phone, and while at work as a receptionist at a hospital, she watched it over and over again, in between listening to beats and tapping out lyrics. In fact, she was on her phone so much that she got fired from that job. But Nasty used her final paycheck of about $300 to make a music video called ""iCarly,"" a bouncy nursery rhyme of illicit thrills named after a Nickelodeon show, and it was that three-minute bomb of magnetism that would prove to be her breakout. A year later, she sold out the very same Maryland venue that Lil Yachty had: ""How crazy is that?"" Six mixtapes and some years on, Rico Nasty is set to release her major label debut, ""Nightmare Vacation,"" on Dec. 4, via Atlantic Records. Combining her sugary, singsong side and the bruising, discordant, mosh-pit scream-rap that she's made her signature on recent viral hits, the album seeks to take advantage of a path for female rappers -- and Black pop stars -- that's never been wider or more for the taking, from Doja Cat and Tierra Whack to Lizzo, Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion. ""We in cahoots,"" Nasty said of the seemingly endless bounty of supportive female artists bubbling up online. ""I don't think it's going anywhere. It's not a phase."" She credited herself with showing that ""you don't have to dress a certain way and you don't have to sound a certain way to be a female rapper,"" but noted that ""there are so many other women that have broken boundaries in their own way."" On the sharpest of her new songs, like ""OHFR?"" and ""iPhone"" -- both produced by Dylan Brady of the brash, futuristic pop disrupters 100 gecs -- Nasty fuses her two dominant sonic impulses, sounding like she's gurgling glass shards with a wicked smile. An anime freak and student of N.O.R.E. and Joan Jett, Nicki Minaj and the Smiths, Tyler, the Creator and Avril Lavigne, Nasty is a master shape-shifter and pop culture collagist, attracting so many self-identified outsiders with her lovably abrasive and profane confidence that she may very well build a new mainstream coalition.

""Think about what the front row at a Rico Nasty concert looks like,"" the producer Kenny Beats, a close collaborator, said in an interview. ""It's literally any type of person who identifies any type of way, who might not feel like they fit in at the average Spotify Rap Caviar, Jingle Ball concert. This is a group of people who are sick of taking crap, feeling different or feeling like they're weird, and they come to a Rico concert and say, 'I'm about to scream my face off.'"" The relationship between Nasty and her most devoted followers has gotten so extreme that they frequently profess their love through requests for violence -- ""step on my neck, throw me through a wall,"" she rattled off -- culminating in her fielding (and fulfilling) constant demands that she smack them in the face. ""Then they started asking me to spit in their mouth,"" Nasty shrugged, adding that she immortalized one such concert moment on a T-shirt. ""I always ask, 'Are you OK at home?'"" she said with a shrug. But Nasty's proficiency with accepting extreme fandom and fostering connection has proved to be one her best marketing tactics, and it comes from the fact that she lived the other side as a self-professed teenage stan, or superfan, of artists like Rihanna and Nicki Minaj. ""To survive stan culture, you have to understand stan culture -- you have to have been a stan,"" she said. ""If anything, it makes me want to open up more.""

Kenny Beats remembered first meeting Nasty in the studio on one of her first big trips to Los Angeles, as a room full of producers were trying and failing to meet her standards the night the song was created. After recording over one of his premade instrumentals, Nasty ""looked so over it,"" the producer said, and left the vocal booth with a request: ""Can you make heavy metal?"" He whipped up a lurching, loud beat on the spot that was only about 10 percent done when Nasty said, ""OK, that's it, give me it like that,"" Kenny Beats recalled, expressing his astonishment that it would become her defining song so far. (The video for the track was so slapdash that his name was misspelled as ""Kenndy Beats."") ""She just does anything and everything,"" he said. The songwriter Jozzy said that Nasty also ""wanted to learn"" in the studio, taking direction to expand her ability to freestyle melodies, in addition to confrontation raps. ""She doesn't think she's a singer, but she really is,"" Jozzy said. Brady of 100 gecs also praised Nasty's punk attitude and willingness to experiment, pointing to her interest in pitch-shifting her vocals on ""iPhone,"" which they completed in two hours during their first time working together. ""She came in with this school Trapper Keeper and opened it up and it was full of like 100 pre-rolled joints, so I knew it was going to be a crazy session,"" he said.

Nasty credits her drive and work ethic to having a child as a teenager. ""Being a mother taught me to go get some money,"" she said. ""Once you become a mom, it's just like, 'OK, strategy. How are we going to pay for this?' You do what's necessary, and sometimes you get creative."" By the time her son was 6 months old, she was charging $75 for guest verses online. ""Rapping was the only thing I saw real results from,"" she said. Her cartoon personas and exaggerated bravado also stem from necessity. The night her son was conceived, she explained in an online documentary about her rise, Nasty's boyfriend passed away from an asthma attack. His death sent her into a suicidal depression, until she found out that she was pregnant -- at about seven months. In the tough period that followed, her mother pushed her to get a life plan together, and Nasty vowed that she would be featured by the rap magazine XXL, which went on to name her to one of its coveted Freshman spots in 2019. The coronavirus pandemic, however, has interrupted her steady rise, presenting challenges both emotional and financial. During a recent trip to New York she said that she got so used to people ""telling me I'm beautiful every day that I got a little depressed,"" adding, ""it's hard to feel famous when you're just walking past your dog every day. Notice me! Tell me to spit on you!"" But she quickly realized that given the myriad miseries in the world right now, it was selfish to center her career, even if the life of a touring musician wasn't as secure as it may appear from the outside.

""When coronavirus hit, it was like that Mister Krabs meme,"" with regards to money, Nasty said, referring to a photo of a perplexed ""SpongeBob SquarePants"" character. ""I could go to Rodeo and spend everything in my bank accounts in 30 minutes."" Without concerts, she has survived by selling her extra clothes, merchandise and a makeup collaboration, in addition to once again doing features for a fee that's healthier than in her early days. She's also had to manage expectations when it comes to her long-awaited debut album, and whether or not it will catapult her into a new echelon. ""When I first signed, I got a little depressed about that type of stuff,"" she admitted. ""'Why isn't it happening? What about me? What am I doing wrong? I have to be No. 1!'"" ""But if you look at the history of this, it's all about who lasts,"" Nasty said, openly wrestling with the extent of her ambition -- or at least admitting it. ""Let me not run away from that, because I tend to run away from owning what it is. I definitely do feel like this is my -- I hate when people do this -- but it's my time."" ""I do want to be 'can't walk around' famous,"" she said. ""That's what I want to be. I want to be 'swarming my hotel' famous. I want to be all that, I definitely do. And I think that I'm on my way.""",The 23-year-old Maryland rapper has built a cult following with her mixtapes of playful but bruising scream-rap.

Movies,"Netflix, Accused of Sexualizing Girls, Pulls Artwork for 'Cuties'",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/movies/netflix-cuties.html,"LONDON -- Netflix has changed the promotional image for ""Cuties,"" an award-winning French film, after it was accused of sexualizing girls. ""We're deeply sorry for the inappropriate artwork that we used for 'Cuties,'"" a spokeswoman for Netflix said. ""It was not OK, nor was it representative of this French film which won an award at Sundance. We've now updated the pictures and description."" Netflix's original artwork promoting ""Cuties"" on the streaming service featured a picture of four young girls posed provocatively, some twerking while wearing hot pants. Now, the promotional image shows the lead actress, Fathia Youssouf, looking over her shoulder. The complaints -- posted in part by followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory -- may have come as a surprise to some, given that ""Cuties,"" the debut feature by Maimouna Doucoure, has been praised for questioning how society and social media pressure young children into acting in sexually explicit ways. Doucoure was named best director in the world cinema category at this year's Sundance Film Festival and received a special mention at this year's Berlinale festival in Germany.

Some are still calling for the film, scheduled to land on Netflix on Sep. 9, to be deleted from the streaming service. One online petition, which had over 170,000 signatures on Friday, urged Netflix not to release it. ""THIS PROBLEM ISNT THE ARTWORK ITS THE FACT ITS ABOUT TWERKING ELEVEN YEAR OLDS FOR ADULT VIEWING PLEASURE,"" read an update to the petition, posted on Thursday. ""TAKE IT DOWN WE HAVE THE SCREENSHOTS,"" it added. Calls to remove the film have gained particular traction among supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory, who believe top Democrats and celebrities like the artist Marina Abramovic are behind a global child trafficking ring. ""Netflix just normalized pedophilia,"" one QAnon-supporting Facebook page posted on Friday. The change to the artwork is only the latest example of Netflix facing pressure to remove content from its streaming platform on moral grounds. In July, it canceled production of a series in Turkey after authorities refused it a permit because the show included a gay character. In 2018, Netflix complied with a request from the Saudi Arabian government and removed an episode of the show ""Patriot Act With Hasan Minhaj"" from the platform in that country because it included criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

The film itself -- released as ""Mignonnes"" in France -- has not caused any such rows. Doucoure's debut feature, it follows the story of 11-year-old Amy (Youssouf) as she struggles to find her place in life. At home, Amy has to please her mother, a Muslim from Senegal, but she's drawn to a group of friends who have their own dance troupe. Doucoure said in June during an interview at the Sundance Film Festival that the idea for ""Cuties"" partly came to her after she attended an event in Paris, where she watched a group of 11-year-olds performing a highly sexualized dance. ""I was so shocked,"" she said. ""For me, it was just, 'Oh my God. What am I seeing?'"" Many of the children's parents, who were also watching the show, wore traditional religious dress, she added, and the culture shock fascinated her. While researching the film, Doucoure became concerned about how social media pressures children to dress provocatively, she said. In France, where the film was released in theaters on Aug. 19, ""Cuties"" has not stirred any controversy. Clarisse Fabre, reviewing the film for Le Monde, said, ""The filmmaker skillfully refrains from passing judgment on the very explicit sexualization of the dance routines."" She named it a ""must see."" Le Figaro, another newspaper, also labeled it a ""film to see."" Reviewers at Sundance didn't see the film as fetishistic either. ""The sight of twerking preteen bodies is explicitly designed to shock mature audiences into a contemplation of today's destruction of innocence,"" wrote Fionnuala Halligan in Screen Daily, but she added that the film ultimately failed because it tried too hard to provoke censure. Doucoure hasn't commented on the fuss or the artwork, and her representative did not respond to an interview request on Friday. But she may appreciate some of the ongoing debate about the sexualization of children in society. ""We can't continue to close our eyes about that,"" she said in the interview at Sundance.","Conspiracy theorists and concerned parents complained about the image associated with ""Cuties,"" a French film that examines how children are encouraged to be sexualized.",0f9da66f-ba6a-50f4-845f-e2b83a0e2cf3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/21/arts/21CUTIES/21CUTIES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1748e01bd2d9c51c7435b9edc37531011cfe56093c8f0197d6f004ecab0b55ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fathia Youssouf, right, in ""Cuties.""",0f9da66f-ba6a-50f4-845f-e2b83a0e2cf3,N24News/imgs/0f9da66f-ba6a-50f4-845f-e2b83a0e2cf3.jpg,5
Theater,Is Milo Rau Really the Most Controversial Director in Theater?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/03/theater/milo-rau-ntgent-controversy.html,"""I'm a bit scandalous,"" the Swiss-born stage director Milo Rau says, ""but at the same time I'm very conservative. I like empathy, I like beauty.""

GHENT, Belgium -- In February, Milo Rau placed classified ads in a Belgian newspaper. He had just become artistic director of NTGent, the city's main theater, and needed actors for his opening production: a portrait of the city based on the Ghent Altarpiece. That altarpiece, completed in 1432, is the leading tourist attraction here and one of the most important works in the history of art. In intricate detail, it shows what seems like the entire cast of the Bible flocking to worship Jesus, in the form of a lamb. For the play, Mr. Rau needed a modern Adam and Eve and a modern Mary. He needed a shepherd, too, preferably with a flock of sheep to bring onstage. He also wanted some modern crusaders, and he knew who he thought fit the bill: jihadists, such as those who returned to Belgium after fighting for the Islamic State in Syria. ""Do you fight for your beliefs? For God?"" one ad reads. ""Did you fight for IS, or another religion?"" It then gave NTGent's email.

Few noticed the ad, but two weeks later Belgium's biggest-selling tabloid ran an article about it. Mr. Rau, 41 and barely known outside theater circles, quickly became the subject of a national -- then an international -- scandal. It was only two years after the Brussels terror attacks, in which 32 people died. ""I have a very broad vision of artistic freedom,"" a local government official said of putting a jihadist onstage, ""but here is a problem with criminal law."" An opinion piece in De Morgen, one of Belgium's more liberal newspapers, called it ""an uninspired and needlessly hurtful stunt."" NTGent didn't get any emails from former jihadists. It did get a lot of hate mail. ""I've had scandals before a premiere, but never afterward,"" Mr. Rau said last month, sitting on a terrace at NTGent's offices, taking a break from rehearsing the play, ""Lam Gods"" (named after the Altarpiece), ahead of its premiere. His meaning: that the controversy would disappear as soon as the play started.

""I didn't really expect the sensitivity,"" Mr. Rau added. He had apologized for the advertising gambit -- sort of: ""I said, 'O.K., sorry, my respect to everyone who died, but now let's ask why I am having this search to represent this subject onstage?' "" Mr. Rau's taboo-challenging productions over the last decade led one publication to call him ""the world's most controversial director."" Born in Bern, Switzerland, he broke out in 2009 with ""The Last Days of the Ceausescus,"" about the trial and execution of Romania's Communist leader and his wife; he was sued afterward by Ceausescu's son for using the family name. In 2015, he attracted attention for a project that included the staging of a mock criminal court in the Democratic Republic of Congo, to ask if the mining industry was complicit in massacres there. Two Congolese politicians were sacked shortly afterward. He drew more headlines in 2016 with ""Five Easy Pieces,"" about Marc Dutroux, a notorious Belgian pedophile and murderer, in which the actors were children. Despite the scandals, most of Mr. Rau's shows are acclaimed. ""It was remarkable,"" Jay Wegman, senior director of N.Y.U. Skirball, said of ""Five Easy Pieces."" ""It's such a horrific topic, but the way one experiences it is intensely moving."" The Skirball is putting it on in March in what will be Mr. Rau's first New York production. ""I found myself not only moved, but also laughing out loud a lot,"" Lyn Gardner wrote in The Guardian. She called the show ""the very opposite of sensational.""

Yet within the theater world, it's not Mr. Rau's plays that are causing a stir. Instead, it's his Ghent Manifesto, issued in May, in which he sets out how he thinks theaters should be run. Point 1: ""It's not just about portraying the world anymore. It's about changing it."" Point 4 bans the performance of classics. Point 7 calls for two amateurs in every performance. (""Animals don't count, but they are welcome,"" it adds.) Point 9 says at least one production per season must be rehearsed or performed in a war zone, an attempt to bring cultural infrastructure to where it's needed most. Even some admirers of his plays, and fellow experimental theatermakers, have been critical. ""I think it's really old-fashioned,"" Alexander Devriendt, artistic director of Ontroerend Goed, an acclaimed Belgian theater group, said in a telephone interview. ""He'll break the rules as soon as he needs to, so why have them?"" Mr. Rau's background doesn't immediately suggest he was destined to push boundaries. He was born in 1977; his father was a doctor, his mother a chemist. They divorced when he was young, and his mother became involved with a ""quite extremist Trotskyist guy"" who kept losing his job because of his views, Mr. Rau said. The family had to move repeatedly, and Mr. Rau said he changed schools ""12 or 13 times."" As a teenager, he learned Hebrew, Greek and Latin and read classical tragedies. But he moved into theater only after trying, and failing, to make movies. ""My first film came to cinemas in 2002 -- I was 25 -- and it was a total disaster,"" he said. It was based on a story by Thomas Pynchon, the American novelist, and featured ""my usual mix of violence, jokes and realism,"" Mr. Rau said. ""I was sure it would win all the prizes, and everybody hated it.""

The manifesto is his effort to end this row: ""I thought, 'O.K., how can we stop this ideological debate and really bring both together?' You follow these rules, then you have a new city theater."" Taking over NTGent gives him a chance to put the manifesto into practice, although it is hard to work out how serious he really is about it. ""I said from the beginning these are rules I want to follow, but it's impossible to do them all,"" he said. Mr. Rau has occasionally suffered himself for tackling difficult subjects. He once tried to stage a play about a Kosovan immigrant to Switzerland who murdered his daughter's teacher, which led to his mother being harassed so much she had to move. So why is he so drawn to making audiences stare down contemporary tragedies? ""I was interested forever in violence,"" Mr. Rau said. ""Violence itself, but also social violence, political violence, those moments when society really cracks and everything's possible. How are humans behaving in that moment, and 10 years, 20 years later? And why do they not behave like it normally? Theater's the one place -- the public place -- where you can talk about that trauma somehow.""

Controversies also bring him attention, Mr. Rau said (he admits to being an egotist), which in turn gets him money to make the plays he wants. ""O.K., I'm a bit scandalous,"" he said, ""but at the same time I'm very conservative. I like empathy, I like beauty, I like solidarity. I'm a big fan of old tools like catharsis."" Stefan Blaske, a dramatist who has long worked with Mr. Rau, said that they aren't trolling for reaction but rather research their subjects deeply. For ""Five Easy Pieces,"" for instance, they met Mr. Dutroux's father and the families of his victims, among many others. They hired psychologists to make sure the children were O.K. and knew the context around the play, too. Mr. Rau has children himself. ""In everything I've done with him, there is dignity,"" Mr. Blaske said, adding that Mr. Rau has empathy for his subjects. ""That is what makes me comfortable with it, because of course we, too, have moral doubts.""

She rehearsed a scene in which she shares this story, reading out the handwritten note he left behind. ""To start, thank you for everything and forgive me everything,"" the letter begins. ""I love you the most."" Ms. Ezzarhouni somehow delivered it calmly. ""Super,"" Mr. Rau said quietly when she was done, before drawing close to see if she was all right. Not everyone was so understanding. After just two performances of ""Lam Gods"" -- called ""an instant classic"" and ""a serene and smart"" show by Belgium's De Standaard newspaper -- Ms. Ezzarhouni withdrew from the production. Members of the Muslim community had pressured her to drop out because the play featured nudity and simulated sex, Mr. Rau reported in a telephone interview. ""I was sitting next to her, and her phone was going every 20 seconds with messages: 'What are you doing? Are you crazy?'"" he said. An audio recording of Ms. Ezzarhouni will be used as the run continues, Mr. Rau added, with a short statement explaining her departure. ""It's a shame,"" he said. ""That scene was really important, like the community winning over this cliche of jihadism. And now it's a little bit pessimistic."" ""But I suppose it is truer of where society is today,"" he added. ""Voila.""",He has a manifesto. He puts jihadism onstage. He's surrounded by scandal.

Health,A Tiny Hospital Struggles to Treat a Burst of Coronavirus Patients,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/16/health/coronavirus-rural-hospitals.html,"Dr. Desmond Wah is used to being the only physician tending to patients during his shifts at Margaret Mary Community Hospital in Batesville, Ind., population 6,500, where at least half of the 25 beds are usually empty. But he was hardly prepared for the weeklong shift he started on March 20, when the two counties Batesville straddles became one of rural America's worst coronavirus hot spots. By the end of the week, most of the hospital's beds were filled with patients who had either tested positive for or were suspected of having the virus. Six were on ventilators, two of which had been lent hastily by a local emergency medical services unit. With limited staff, equipment and medicine, Dr. Wah and a handful of nurses and respiratory therapists had to scramble. They had only five intensive care beds, and no experience with caring for multiple patients on ventilators at once. They ran out of propofol, the drug they normally use to anesthetize patients and had to urgently consult with an anesthesia team at a big Cincinnati hospital about alternatives. ""We were trying to manage them on a ventilator with limited support, burning through our sedation protocols, having to use sedatives we never typically use,"" Dr. Wah said. ""We were just cobbling stuff together.""

With older, poorer and less healthy populations than many of their urban and suburban counterparts, and far fewer specialists and financial resources, rural hospitals are potentially facing not only many more critically ill patients than they can handle, but also financial ruin because of the indefinite halt in outpatient revenue, which they rely on overwhelmingly. The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package that Congress approved last month includes $100 billion in emergency funds for hospitals, but those in rural areas say the formula for distributing the money favors their big urban counterparts. ""They were in a world of hurt even before this occurred,"" said Jimmy Lewis, the chief executive of HomeTown Health, a group that advocates for rural hospitals in Georgia, which is home to five of the 10 rural counties with the highest infection rates in the United States, according to a New York Times analysis.

Some rural hospitals are owned by larger systems that provide extra resources to help. That is the case in Cleburne County, Ark., which has reported 70 cases that began in a single church, and in Blaine County, Idaho, where more than 100 attendees at a ski event last month contracted the virus and which now has one of the highest per capita infection rates in the nation, with more than 450 reported cases. There, St. Luke's Wood River Medical Center in Ketchum, with 25 beds, temporarily lost most of its seven emergency medicine doctors to infection or exposure in recent weeks, but the St. Luke's system sent reinforcements from Boise, more than 150 miles away. The entire hospital closed for several weeks except for the emergency department, and it is sending patients seriously ill with coronavirus to hospitals in bigger cities. For Margaret Mary -- named after a mother and daughter who helped pay for the hospital to be built in the 1930s -- some of the most urgent questions are when, where and how to transfer patients too sick to handle locally. The hospital has transferred 20 patients to Cincinnati, a 45-minute drive away, so far, but that was not without layers of complications. Some patients' families were reluctant for them to leave their hometown hospital for the anonymity of a much bigger one, especially since nobody could accompany them.

Tom Wilson, a retired paramedic, got the news that his wife, Willa, 65, would be transferred to Christ Hospital in Cincinnati just as he was falling ill himself last month. Five weeks later she remains there on a ventilator, while Mr. Wilson, who was admitted to Margaret Mary for six days, is home alone. ""We wait on a call once a day from a doctor that tells us how she's doing, and that's about all the contact we have,"" said Mr. Wilson, 65, who lives in tiny Metamora, Ind., 15 miles from Batesville. ""It sucks."" At Margaret Mary, he knew some of the people who cared for him and felt at home. ""When my wife got transferred,"" he said, ""they came in and consoled me and we cried on each others' shoulders."" It is not yet clear why the Indiana counties that Margaret Mary serves, Franklin and Ripley, with a combined population of just over 40,000, were hit so hard by the virus, with a combined 163 cases and 10 deaths to date. An adjacent county, Decatur, has an even higher rate of infection, with 155 cases and 13 deaths. Unlike rural hot spots in Idaho, Utah and Colorado, which have large ski resorts that draw visitors from all over, the region has little tourism. Batesville is, however, just off busy Interstate 74, between Cincinnati and Indianapolis. And it has two large manufacturers, a casket company that has been there for more than a century and a medical supplier that makes hospital beds, which draw workers and visitors from outside the immediate area, including China, where the virus originated.

Among the coronavirus patients filling the emergency department at Margaret Mary the week of March 20 was Dr. Jeffrey Hatcher, an obstetrician who has delivered babies at the hospital since 1997. He started feeling sick in mid-March and fought the virus at home, alone with his dogs, until his oxygen saturation levels dropped low enough to frighten him. A chest X-ray and blood tests determined he did not need to be admitted, and he is now preparing to return to work. ""The beauty of our town is that you can pick up the phone, talk to our E.R. doc, he says he's got a spot for you, come on in,"" Dr. Hatcher said. ""Most people at the hospital are going to know you, whether you're their neighbor, somebody's relative, somebody's friend."" While hospitalists like Dr. Wah have handled coronavirus patients sick enough to be admitted to Margaret Mary, family doctors like Dr. Michelle Shorten have been trying to keep tabs on their chronically ill patients -- those with diabetes, high blood pressure, severe asthma and other such conditions -- via phone or video appointments, to ensure they, too, don't end up needing one of the hospital's scarce beds. Dr. Shorten has also been developing a ""surge plan"" in case the hospital gets an even bigger influx of coronavirus patients. She said the hospital could take as many as 66 inpatients -- almost three times its normal capacity -- with each room holding two patients and the labor and delivery department moving to a wing of the hospital normally used for same-day surgeries.

Other doctors who do not typically treat inpatients have volunteered to help, too. ""I even have a psychiatrist who informed me last week that he has pretty good experience working in an I.C.U. and if we need him, he will step up,"" Mr. Putnam, the hospital's chief executive officer, said. Even in good times, financially, rural hospitals like Margaret Mary have a much harder time staying afloat than larger, busier institutions. Forty-four percent of rural hospitals operate in the red, according to the Chartis Center for Rural Health, an advisory and analytics firm based in Maine, which also estimates that about 450 rural hospitals are at risk of having to close, as many already have. For most, the bulk of their revenue comes from run-of-the-mill medical appointments, tests, scans and other procedures done on an outpatient basis. With those canceled indefinitely, the cash that these hospitals have on hand has plummeted. Margaret Mary, which employs 40 doctors and 815 people over all, is in a better position than many: Indiana is among the 36 states that have expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, so relatively few of its patients are uninsured. The hospital has invested wisely over the decades and has built up cash reserves. Still, its daily revenues have plummeted to less than 40 percent of what they normally are, Mr. Putnam said.

""We are concerned that the few rural-specific provisions in the stimulus bill will be too little and too late for many rural hospitals,"" Ms. Elehwany said. ""Some of these hospitals aren't going to be there by the time the surge hits them."" Although Batesville got hit early and most rural counties have now confirmed at least one case, many rural hospitals predict they will not see a surge of coronavirus patients until next month or even June. Dr. Wah said they should be preparing scrupulously. ""Everyone wants to keep the business local, but you have to be aware of your limitations,"" he said. ""If your E.R. cannot handle it, don't try to be gung ho."" Margaret Mary's inpatient population peaked at 30 around March 30 and has dropped back to normal since then. If another surge should come, Dr. Wah dreads two things in particular. One is not having time to get to know each patient, as doctors in a slower rural environment are usually able to do. ""People were deteriorating so quickly that I had to be like, 'Sorry, I can't talk to you anymore just in case you crash and burn,'"" he recalled. Even worse is the prospect of having to rush when informing a family member that someone has died from the virus, as two of the hospital's coronavirus patients have so far.","Rural hospitals have few or no intensive care beds, ventilators or critical care specialists. Here's how one hospital, with a single doctor caring for inpatients, handled a Covid-19 surge.",322e94cb-f1c8-5ed9-a80e-d509c48e79ed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/17/science/14VIRUS-RURALHOSPITALS1/14VIRUS-RURALHOSPITALS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e4c71ece19f5fc276e3732d6cbcfafa2fd479e9118d267fd73e788c8f93efe0b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nearly all the beds at Margaret Mary Community Hospital in Batesville, Ind., were filled one day last month with confirmed or suspected coronavirus patients.",322e94cb-f1c8-5ed9-a80e-d509c48e79ed,N24News/imgs/322e94cb-f1c8-5ed9-a80e-d509c48e79ed.jpg,1
Health,"Centers to Treat Eating Disorders Are Growing, and Raising Concerns",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/15/health/eating-disorders-anorexia-bulimia-treatment-centers.html,"Ashley Bilkie, 29, at home in Northville, Mich. She enrolled in four inpatient programs for treatment of anorexia, for which her father said he paid at least $350,000 in unreimbursed costs, before making progress at Johns Hopkins Medical Center.

Their websites show peaceful scenes -- young women relaxing by the ocean or caring for horses in emerald pastures -- and boast of their chefs and other amenities. One center sends out invitations to a reception with cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. Another offers doctors and therapists all-expense-paid trips to visit and experience their offerings, including yoga classes. Several employ staff who call mental health professionals, saying they would love to have lunch. The marketing efforts by these for-profit residential care centers are aimed at patients with eating disorders and the clinicians who treat them. The programs have proliferated in recent years, with some companies expanding across the country. The rapid growth of the industry -- there are more than 75 centers, compared with 22 a decade ago, according to one count -- has been propelled by the Affordable Care Act and other changes in health insurance laws that have increased coverage for mental disorders, as well as by investments from private equity firms.

The residential programs, their directors say, fill a dire need, serving patients from areas where no adequate treatment is available. ""Only 15 to 30 percent of people have access to specialized care for eating disorders, which means there are a lot of people out there who have zippo,"" said Doug Bunnell, the chief clinical officer for Monte Nido, a program that began in Malibu, Calif., and now operates centers in five states. But the advertising and the profusion of centers, which typically cost $1,000 a day but can run much higher, is raising concerns among some eating disorders experts, who worry that some programs may be taking advantage of vulnerable patients and their families. In the companies' rush to expand, they argue, quality of treatment may be sacrificed for profit. And they question whether the spalike atmosphere of some programs is so comfortable that it fosters dependency. ""For the most part, the people who are running and working in these programs believe they're doing the right thing,"" said Dr. Angela Guarda, the director of the eating disorders program at the Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. ""But it's a slippery slope,"" she said. ""Money can cloud your view."" Many eating disorders specialists agree that some patients require the supervision of residential programs and benefit from the treatment. But studies showing the programs' effectiveness are scant, Dr. Guarda and other experts said. The methods of the handful of studies that exist have been criticized.

In an article to be published Monday in the journal Psychiatric Services, Dr. Evelyn Attia, a professor of psychiatry and director of the eating disorders program at Columbia University Medical Center, and four colleagues called for more transparency about the financial relationships between residential centers and the professionals who send them patients, and urged clinicians to be mindful of efforts to influence their recommended treatment. ""The effect of these clinician inducements, which are aimed at building a program's patient referral base, may not be fully recognized by the professionals they target,"" wrote Dr. Attia and her colleagues, who included Dr. Guarda. Several industry representatives said that while they had not seen the journal article, they agreed that more data on patient outcomes and stricter standards were needed. But, they said, the trips and seminars offered to clinicians were primarily educational. ""I don't think anyone in the eating disorders world is giving out swimming pools and trips to Europe and things like that,"" Dr. Bunnell said. Jillian Lampert, president of the Residential Eating Disorders Consortium, a group that represents about 85 percent of the centers, said, ""Health care's always been a business,"" adding that quality and profit were not mutually exclusive. If there are concerns, she said, ""we are incredibly open to having those conversations.""

Eating disorders are among the most difficult mental illnesses to treat. Anorexia, in particular, has stymied many of psychiatry's best treatment efforts. The illness has the highest mortality rate of any mental disorder, with patients dying from the medical complications of starvation or from suicide. And patients often resist treatments that make them feel uncomfortable. The most severely ill patients -- the prognosis is grimmer the longer someone has anorexia, studies suggest -- require hospital treatment just to stay alive. But even after being stabilized, many patients need continual supervision for a time to regain weight and learn new behavior. The length of stay in residential centers ranges from two weeks to a year. A 2006 study found that the average stay was 83 days. In the past, health insurance companies placed strict limits on coverage for eating disorders, treating them differently from other medical illnesses. Few insurers were willing to pay for 24-hour care after a patient was out of immediate danger. But the passage of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act in 2008 and the Affordable Care Act two years later mandated equal treatment. Lawsuits brought by the families of patients who were denied coverage added to the pressure on insurers. In 2012, a federal appeals court ruled that health plans must cover residential treatment for anorexia under California's parity law. The higher reimbursement rates offered some relief to families, who had often mortgaged their houses or drained their savings to pay for critically needed care. They also attracted the attention of Wall Street investors, who saw profits in providing treatment for so-called behavioral health problems like eating disorders, alcoholism and drug abuse. ""The number of covered lives is growing faster than the availability of services to treat them, creating compelling investment opportunities,"" the accounting and consulting firm BDO noted last year in an article on its website, referring to the effects of the legal changes. As the industry has expanded, larger centers have acquired smaller ones and some programs, flush with private equity investments, have expanded across the country. For example, Monte Nido, a treatment program founded by Carolyn Costin, a former teacher who recovered from an eating disorder, began with a center in Malibu.

But in 2012, with financing from Centre Partners, a middle-market equity firm, Monte Nido began opening new residential centers and day-treatment programs. The company now has centers in Oregon, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania and New York, including one in a renovated mansion in Westchester County. Last year, noting that the investment had ""tripled the company's facility footprint during our ownership period,"" Centre Partners sold Monte Nido to another investment firm, Levine Leichtman Capital Partners, for an undisclosed sum. ""I believe that the Monte Nido's [sic] approach to eating disorder treatment is what you and others like you have been waiting for,"" Ms. Costin wrote in a letter to potential patients on the company's website, which includes images of beaches, mountains and the Boston skyline on its home page. With a need to fill more beds, marketers for some centers make cold calls to psychiatrists, psychotherapists, medical doctors and others who treat eating disorders, offering to inform them about a program's advantages and inviting them to visit. The Denver-based Eating Recovery Center has a call center and employs 20 ""professional relations liaisons"" who contact clinicians across the country. The author and motivational speaker Jenni Schaefer, who recovered from an eating disorder, recently joined the program's outreach team. On its website, the company, which began with a single center, bills itself as ""the only national health care system devoted to serious eating disorders at all levels of care."" Craig Johnson, a well-known eating disorders specialist, joined the company in 2010 and has seen it through its expansion to 24 treatment programs in seven states, including three residential centers. He said when therapists visit, the focus is education, not entertainment. ""We're delivering lectures,"" Dr. Johnson said.

Some therapists see the offer of free trips as a chance to view the facilities that they might recommend to patients. Ann Jacob Smith, a family therapist in Chevy Chase, Md., said that last year, she accepted an invitation to visit the Oliver-Pyatt eating disorders center in Miami. (The center is now part of Monte Nido). ""It was absolutely promotional,"" she said, ""But it was actually really educational. They took us in depth into what they did."" Her later referrals were not influenced by the visit, she added. ""I'm not impressed by being romanced."" But Adrian Brown, a psychiatrist in Virginia, said that therapists who had not gone through the ""battle phase"" with drug companies might not even realize they were being swayed by financial interests. Dr. Brown recalled being offered a ""V.I.P."" trip to a treatment center, with the representative telling her, ""We will pay your way, put you up in a really nice hotel, all expenses paid, yoga and whatever.""

Prospective patients or family members searching for a treatment program sometimes turn to sites like edtreatmentreview.com or www.edtxreviews.com, where former patients describe their experiences at different centers, evaluating the staff, critiquing the food and noting whether cellphones are allowed. Many reviewers have spent time in more than one residential center and the opinions on any particular program vary widely, a range reflected in interviews with former patients over the last several months. Tina Klaus, a 51-year-old artist who has struggled with bulimia since she was 10, said residential care was initially useful. ""Residential treatment is vital when you are at your ultimate rock bottom"" she said. But once home, her illness worsened because ""you're going back into your life, you're going back into all the emotions you used your eating disorder to hide from."" Melissa R., 28, who asked that her last name not be used for reasons of privacy, said after several hospitalizations for anorexia, beginning when she was 21, she found a residential center in the Southwest on the Internet and spent six weeks there. The center, which she described as ""more like a resort,"" was ""somewhat helpful,"" she said, but not worth the time and money. ""People were nice, and the food was really good,"" she said. ""I had fun, I enjoyed rock climbing and stuff, but that's not why I was there. I'm paying a lot of money to get well, not to rock climb.""

Last year, she spent two months at Eating Recovery Center in Denver, moving from residential care to day treatment, and began to gain control of her illness. ""E.R.C. was the best place I've been,"" she said about the center. ""They were very individualized."" Ashley Bilkie, 29, had a different experience with E.R.C. When she returned home in February 2015 after about six months in the Denver program -- her fourth stay in an inpatient program for treatment of anorexia and her second at E.R.C. -- ""I was getting sicker and sicker,"" she said. She lost the weight she had gained back at the center. ""I had to buy children's clothing,"" she said. She was evasive with her parents. At the recovery center, she said, ""It was kind of like they set up a battle between myself and my parents."" For their part, Ms. Bilkie's parents, who for years had watched their daughter's health decline, grew frantic. Ms. Bilkie would disappear, her father, Robert Bilkie, said, and he would find her wandering the aisles at Kroger or Target. Driving through the neighborhood, he half-expected to see her hanging from a tree. It was also expensive. Mr. Bilkie, a financial adviser in Michigan, calculated that over three years, he paid at least $350,000 for unreimbursed inpatient care for his daughter. The Eating Recovery Center, he said, sent him bills for $30,000 each month. Mr. Bilkie paid willingly -- he was desperate to see Ashley get well, he said -- but no program seemed to produce lasting results. ""We spent an outrageous amount of money for what really amounted to ineffectual treatment,"" Mr. Bilkie said. Last fall, Ms. Bilkie entered the eating disorder center at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center, a university affiliated program.

The staff there gradually weaned her off some drugs she had been taking taking at the center in Denver, including high doses of Xanax, a tranquilizer, and Adderall, an attention deficit drug and a stimulant. In group therapy, other patients put pressure on her to change her behavior. It was a switch, she said, from previous groups, where patients talked about their problems. With the program's stress on weight restoration -- studies show that it is the best predictor of how anorexic patients will do once they leave, rather than, say, elevated mood -- her weight returned to normal. She was discharged in November and continues to do well. ""I hated every single solitary second of it,"" she said of the experience. ""But that's a good thing, because I was not comfortable, and it meant that something was working."" Dr. Ovidio Bermudez, the chief clinical officer of Eating Recovery Center, said that other patients have fared poorly at academic centers and then done well at E.R.C. Despite Ms. Bilkie's perception, he said, therapists at the program did not try to divide patients from their families. (Ms. Bilkie gave Eating Recovery Center permission to discuss her case.) ""We would have to filter this through 20/20 hindsight,"" Dr. Bermudez said. ""It's really hard to know what somebody's frame of mind is and the degree of fragility they bring to any treatment experience."" Dr. Anne Marie O'Melia, a psychiatrist at the recovery center, said Ms. Bilkie was on Xanax when she arrived and was fearful of reducing the drug's dosage, though the center tried. She was switched to Adderall from another stimulant at E.R.C., Dr. O'Melia said, to treat ""significant impulsivity."" Ms. Bilkie's history of ups and downs is not unusual for patients with eating disorders. ""In many cases, you see one step forward, two steps back,"" said Dr. Mark Friedlander, the chief medical officer for Aetna Behavioral Health.

His company, Dr. Friedlander said, considers residential care essential for treatment of some patients. But, he said, a lack of outcome studies, an absence of industry standards and a patchwork licensing system across states make it difficult for Aetna or other insurers to evaluate care. ""We would love to see greater consistency and higher standards,"" he said. To that end, a group of eating disorder specialists from treatment centers, including Eating Recovery Center and Monte Nido, have developed a list of minimum requirements for accreditation of residential programs. The Joint Commission, an independent company that accredits health care facilities, has adopted the requirements, which go into effect July 1. Dr. Lampert, president of the consortium, said the centers in the organization were also collecting data on patient outcomes, lengths of stay and other variables, with each center collecting data on 15 consecutive admissions of adults and adolescents. In the meantime, many patients and families will continue to rely on word of mouth and any information they can find online. ""These are black boxes,"" Dr. Scott Hadland, an adolescent medicine specialist at Harvard Medical School, said of the residential centers.

Dance,The Secrets and the Magic Are in the Details,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/19/arts/dance/vicky-shicks-pathetique-miniatures-in-detail.html,"In the program note for the current installment of Soaking Wet, the dance series that David Parker directs at the West End Theater on the Upper West Side, he speaks of presenting the work of Vicky Shick as a longtime dream come true. It seemed to him that her ""exacting, poetic work"" would be a perfect match for the ""funky, mysterious space"" on the second floor of a church. The debut on Thursday of Ms. Shick's ""Pathetique/Miniatures in Detail"" proved him right.

It's not just Ms. Shick who is perfect. ""Pathetique"" is her seventh collaboration with the costume designer Barbara Kilpatrick and the sound designer Elise Kermani. This is one of the most reliably beguiling teams in dance. That consistency might seem to preclude surprise -- each work is quite similar to the others -- yet it is nevertheless surprising how these three, every time, find or make fresh magic.

The magic tends to be modest and momentary. Though their 2013 piece, ""Everything You See,"" featured an uncharacteristically large cast of 10, it and each previous collaboration might also have been titled ""Miniatures in Detail."" Ms. Shick's choreography habitually takes the form of a series of brief -- sometimes very brief -- solos and duets brimming with particularities. This time, there's a cast of four: Ms. Shick, Marilyn Maywald, Omagbitse Omagbemi and Olsi Gjeci.

Casting matters. Ms. Shick, as might be expected, is a master of her own style and its unassuming blend of formal composition and sensual flow, of the everyday and the eccentric. But she's also marvelous at making -- or perhaps letting -- her dancers look their best, distinctive without affectation. Ms. Maywald is particularly lucid here. The extraordinary Ms. Omagbemi, new to Ms. Shick's work, brings something new to it: low-bending, African-seeming steps and a deep-seated intensity to hip action.","Vicky Shick's ""Pathétique/Miniatures in Detail"" is playing at the West End Theater as part of the Soaking Wet series.",eb749f6a-4dfb-526b-9c0a-37f6dfd90176,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/19/arts/19soaking/19soaking-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=430&w=600&s=4352292e00deaee0fd9784e962d472b80a563542a8922735b920f1e5497a4180&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Pathétique/Miniatures in Detail , by Vicky Shick, features Ms. Shick, left, and Omagbitse Omagbemi, at the West End Theater in the Soaking Wet series.",eb749f6a-4dfb-526b-9c0a-37f6dfd90176,N24News/imgs/eb749f6a-4dfb-526b-9c0a-37f6dfd90176.jpg,6
Books,What Do the Sex Lives of 'Three Women' Tell Us About Female Desire?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/09/books/review/three-women-lisa-taddeo.html,"This one is for the ladies. I have a small tray decorated with two gorgeous, red-lipped glamour girls, poised for the good life in front of a lush bush of bright pink flowers. Splashed across their image is this aphorism: ""I believe we have an opportunity to make some extremely poor choices."" This is one of women's abiding truths when it comes to their love lives. ""Falling in love"" frequently produces the curious inclination in a woman to abdicate her sovereignty and seat a man on her own throne. But then love for women has a long history as slavery. Sacrilege as it may be to say, ""falling in love"" remains criminally oversold to girls in our culture. From their earliest fairy tales, it is the Great Event. A man has always been a woman's best excuse to avoid her destiny; that a man is her destiny is one of patriarchy's most pernicious tenets. What a scam. And often we leap into our ""poor choices"" with the operatic flourish of Juliet, Madama Butterfly or Tosca -- all dead by suicide at show's end. Yet most of us survive our grand passions -- the truly great ones break you so as to remake you. These are what we will remember on our deathbeds as the moments when we were most alive. Deep eros plunges one face to face with death, here, now. But is the price we pay worth it? Enter a new treatise on the subject. Lisa Taddeo's ""Three Women"" is an excavation of three American women's love lives. All are white and (mostly) heterosexual, and they range in age from 16 to early 40s: a highly limited, though serviceable, group. Taddeo's subjects allowed her to observe them intimately over a number of years. She explains in an author's note that she spent countless hours with these women in person, on the phone and over text message and email, while following their social media accounts. She read their diaries, interviewed their friends and family and relied on their memories.

Taddeo's intent -- and her publisher's hope -- is to reveal what ""female desire"" looks like today. Despite the glut in our society of anything and everything sexual, very little approaches the shocking, truly revolutionary, revelations in the sexual fantasies of hundreds of women that Nancy Friday collected in the 1970s. The stunning variety and lasciviousness of female perversions detailed in Friday's anthologies knocked our madonna off her altar into the gutter -- but, under threat of anarchy, our loosened whore is always, soon again, chastened.

The result of Taddeo's investigation, however, is not a book about the vast terra infirma of female desire, but, rather, an excruciating expose of the ongoing epidemic of female fragility and neediness in the romantic arena -- a product of our insecurity, ignorance and zero self-regard. Taddeo's sad, searing, sometimes unbearably painful tales of bad decisions, agonies and humiliations at the shrine of ""love"" show us that, in spite of 10 to 15 minutes here and there of truly hot sex, a woman ""in love"" is frequently a basket case. The stories of Taddeo's subjects, Sloane, Lina and Maggie, all feature the illicit -- threesomes, dominance and submission, underage sex -- and each includes a hefty dose of good old-fashioned adultery. Maggie Wilken's story dominates the book and for good reason: It ended up in court. Maggie, who lives in Fargo, N.D., had a relationship for approximately one year, starting when she was 16, with Aaron Knodel, her 29-year-old high school English teacher, who was married with two young children. Maggie confides in a letter to Knodel her big secret: She has recently lost her virginity to a military man, 15 years her senior, while vacationing in Hawaii, and found it exciting. Knodel suggests they speak. So it begins.

Maggie does everything she can to ""preserve the relationship,"" not reminding him she is underage, not mentioning his wife and kids. Soon he texts her: ""I think I am falling in love with you."" He reads Maggie's copy of ""Twilight,"" returning it doused in his cologne, with masses of yellow Post-it Note annotations. ""I am your vampire lover,"" he writes, ""and you are my forbidden fruit."" She sleeps with the book. On his 30th birthday, Maggie texts him around 7 a.m. ""Happy Birthday!!!"" By 8 a.m. his wife has seen the message, and the affair is over. Boom. When Knodel is named ""North Dakota's Teacher of the Year"" in 2014, Maggie breaks her five years of silence and despair and tells her parents about the relationship. She goes to the police. Six months later her father slits his wrists and dies. In court Knodel fingers a rosary and claims not to remember Maggie much during the year of their affair, but does recall that she was ""needy"" and had ""issues."" He is acquitted on three of five charges of corrupting a minor. A mistrial is declared on the other two charges -- owing to a juror's sudden mysterious illness -- alleging oral and digital penetration. Knodel was reinstated with back pay and is currently teaching and coaching in the North Dakota public school system. Maggie, meanwhile, gains 30 pounds, survives on a cocktail of five drugs, drops out of college, plans her suicide by hanging, and waits tables. Despite everything, Maggie still loves her high school teacher. Cue Tammy Wynette. It is Taddeo's victory that we see Maggie's tragedy: Knodel gave this girl the validation, the attention, that no one else ever had -- or perhaps ever will. Her blessing, her curse. This is Taddeo's first book, but she has garnered two Pushcart Prizes for her dense, disturbing short stories about women. Here, but for a few quoted conversations, she writes her narratives in the third person, in her own dramatic, often overreaching, staccato prose. While the complex feelings of the women conveyed may well be true, the voice is categorically Taddeo's, not theirs. Nevertheless, the result is effective and affecting. Strangely, she has elected to draw no conclusions. So here are a few of mine.

Mother Nature has heavily handicapped women. From age 15 to 50 our brains are a swamp of hormones -- you know, the ones that make us the origin of the human race. A female orgasm releases a tsunami of neurochemicals, suctioning us to that fallible Joe who happens to be in the vicinity, every climax another knot in our involuntary bondage. And so we continue, despite more than 200 years of feminism culminating in Andrea Dworkin's glorious rage, to be inept voyagers in search of ""love,"" repeatedly abandoning our own ship to board some dude's dinghy. Why does the femme fatale -- who wields her unyielding power with charm -- in our culture have no traction as an actual role model? Where is Barbara Stanwyck when we need her? Extraordinary erotic longing rarely survives stabilization, and Taddeo reveals an avalanche of evidence, as if we needed more, that the cozy comforts of marriage and its defining, confining attribute, monogamy, provide the perfect petri dish for combustible sex -- with someone other than your spouse. Taddeo's book features one unethical, horny, entitled guy after another, but what else is new? Our current discourse is filled, rightly, with women's #MeToo revelations about loathsome male misbehavior and worse, while we simultaneously reassert our roles as their victims, confirming, with our nagging, weeping and public shaming, our complicity on the patriarchal merry-go-round. But patriarchy cannot change patriarchy, as a leopard cannot change his spots. The time is up, the clock has run out: Men no longer deserve our understanding or tears or time. Until women realize our pre-eminence, and act accordingly, with its inherent responsibilities, we will never get a grip on our own happiness. Might we shift our thinking, reorder our priorities and discipline our minds in our affairs with men? Can we change ourselves? If we did the world would change too.","To write her book, Lisa Taddeo spent thousands of hours over eight years getting to know her subjects in an effort to understand their erotic yearnings and obsessions.",27d5e8ce-7a10-50af-87b8-9794031e1790,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/11/books/review/11Bentley1/Bentley1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=cc55b361e6ff98bf3cf72d4d6aeec50c3c1148f8492df51aa1f00b4b86012274&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lisa Taddeo's book is an exposé of female fragility and neediness in the romantic arena.,27d5e8ce-7a10-50af-87b8-9794031e1790,N24News/imgs/27d5e8ce-7a10-50af-87b8-9794031e1790.jpg,13
Style,They Fled the Coronavirus. Now They're in Scenic Limbo.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/11/style/they-fled-the-coronavirus-now-theyre-in-scenic-limbo.html,"The day before Megan LeCrone, a soloist dancer with the New York City Ballet, turned 36, she got an urgent call from her longtime friend and fellow soloist Harrison Ball. ""If we don't leave now, we're not going to be able to get out,"" he told her. The date was March 20, when only 17,000 Americans had tested positive for the coronavirus, schools around the country had just closed and nonessential workers were beginning to tire of the ""are you wearing pants?"" jokes on Zoom. Ms. LeCrone and Mr. Ball sped through Kennedy International Airport, which was deserted, and, despite takeoffs being canceled all around them, boarded the final flight to their destination. ""It felt like we were crossing into West Berlin,"" Mr. Ball said. They were, in fact, flying to the Bahamas. And there they have remained. If you're going on week nine of an air-shaft view, with 17 varieties of pasta shapes for company, you may be breathing into a paper bag right now. And while many who can afford it stayed proudly in their home cities, some decided to move, ""Green Acres""-like, to less-infected pastures.

Not just the Matt Damons or Jerry Seinfelds of the world. (Mr. Damon is staying in the seaside resort town of Dalkey, Ireland, after production for a forthcoming Ridley Scott film was shut down nearby; Mr. Seinfeld, who lives with his family in a terraced duplex in the Beresford on Central Park West, is sequestered in East Hampton.) The New York City Department of Sanitation has recorded a more than a 3 percent drop in garbage in the more affluent ZIP codes of the Upper East and West Sides. But there are also those who thought they could sneak in a quick getaway and be back in plenty of time for Dr. Fauci's next warning of impending doom. Which brings us back to Ms. LeCrone and Mr. Ball, and everyone else interviewed for this story. To put it bluntly, they get it. They know that their privilege -- financial, physical, professional, personal -- allowed them to leave their homes, where infections were rapidly multiplying. They know you will have about as much sympathy for them as you did for David Geffen on his $590 million superyacht in the Grenadines, or those newlyweds who kept an entire hotel staff at work in the Maldives. They also know they cannot get home. After a spring break family ski trip to Lake Tahoe in California was canceled, Morgan Bernstein, the director of strategic initiatives at U.C. Berkeley's Haas School of Business, thought of an empty house her mother keeps in Honolulu. ""We floated the idea of going to Hawaii by a couple of friends and they said, 'It sounds amazing, but you know you might get stuck there,'"" Ms. Bernstein said. ""At the time it was, 'Ha-ha, yeah, right.'""

Two months later, her husband is unemployed, the family car is in need of repairs after a Bay Area break-in, and their kids are happily playing catch with floating coconuts. ""I really struggled at first feeling trapped between work and vacation, feeling displaced and isolated, even though it's definitely not a 'poor me' situation,"" Ms. Bernstein said. ""I would half-jokingly bring things up on Zoom happy hours with my friends about not having my pajamas and face lotions and all the little things that make me feel like I'm at home. They were like, 'Seriously, Morgan? You're complaining about cleansers when you're in Hawaii?'"" Ms. Bernstein also worries about the faux-rosy reality she has created for her 5- and 7-year-olds. ""They get that there is a virus that is making people sick, but I've never seen them happier,"" she said. ""They think they're on an extended vacation. It makes me wonder if I'm robbing my kids of the experience of understanding what the world is going through. Are they not going to relate to their peers because they will have experienced this time in such a different way?""

They spent their first 12 days surfing on remote beaches with no internet access. The second Ms. Boher walked into her hotel room in Granada, she turned on the air-conditioner and flipped on CNN. ""The first thing we thought when we saw what had happened to the world was, 'Dear God,'"" she said. Just then, a truck drove down the street with someone claiming to be from the government yelling through a megaphone in Spanish, ""Hey, everybody! You know how the United States and China think they're better than us? They're screwed now!"" After several failed attempts to find a place to stay (locals were understandably wary of renting to possibly infected tourists), Ms. Boher met a woman who charged $500 for a casita on a property shared by a virus-fleeing Australian couple, sack of coconuts and plantains included. ""I'm still in the same mental reality as everyone else, regardless of where I physically am,"" she said. ""I look at the news and I'm devastated for hours. But I also have gratitude for real change. I've lived in cities my whole life and now I watch the first star come out every night."" She has a friend in Los Angeles fulfilling pipe orders and no ticket home, since the airline she flew down doesn't operate the route anymore. ""We all have a story of this time,"" Ms. Boher said. ""And this is just my little story. This is my chain of weird events. It's not better. It's not worse. It just is.""

Across the planet, Josh Anchors, the director of global admissions at Leman Manhattan Preparatory School in New York, and his girlfriend of three months, Navia Nguyen, landed in Indonesia with hours to spare before visitors were banned. Without the same social restrictions that were in place in New York, Mr. Anchors got to Bali in time for five surf sessions and a trip to the wellness center that his girlfriend owns, where he luxuriated in a microdermabrasion facial, manicure, pedicure and vitamin-C drip. But once the government closed nonessential businesses on April 1, he was quarantined at his girlfriend's house, testing out the nascent relationship under conditions so extreme it's a wonder producers of ""The Bachelor"" didn't devise them. ""You really get to know someone in depth in these circumstances,"" Mr. Anchors said. ""This is isolation-ship. Quaran-ship? Every once in a while we are like, 'What are we doing?'"" (Plus an expletive.)

At first, he hid from colleagues the fact that he was halfway across the globe, and set his alarm to 2 or 3 a.m. to join meetings that would have been midafternoon back in New York. He has since come clean. ""There's no reason to go home now, other than hugging my parents, which I can't even do,"" Mr. Anchors said. Working remotely has only increased his job efficiency, and he's hopeful that with comparatively few cases on the island, his dry surfboard will be back in action soon. ""I don't feel stranded,"" he said. ""I feel liberated."" After years working as an event planner in New York, Laura Ling had saved up enough money to travel for months and caught the last flight into Medellin, Colombia, before the borders closed.

""It was very weird to be two or three weeks ahead in terms of the virus. I knew their corona-future,"" she said. After hearing that immigration officers were picking up tourists on the streets and throwing them out of the country, she began self-quarantining, venturing out occasionally to her balcony or rooftop terrace. ""My industry is dead,"" Ms. Ling said. ""I talk to colleagues, and we know we won't be making any money off events in 2020. I've just started to think about what other career options I have."" Every night she watches President Ivan Duque's nightly address to the nation, where he talks about saving abuelos and abuelas. ""I have no regrets about coming here and I don't think about anything beyond the next three days,"" she said. ""At least I am still learning Spanish.""

Back in the Bahamas, Mr. Ball and Ms. LeCrone also don't know when they'll return to the barre, with their ballet company's entire spring season canceled. They stick to a strict daily regimen of swimming, ballet, yoga and a scary-sounding class called ""Shaun T's Insanity."" They pay an islander $10 to deliver giant bags of mangoes and eat whatever they can catch spearfishing. They also check in on New York friends whose practice jetes have become the bane of downstairs neighbors' lives. ""Artists are dramatic by nature so there is a lot of, 'Are we ever going to dance again?'"" Mr. Ball said. ""We decided maybe we shouldn't have the ocean in the background,"" Ms. LeCrone said. ""We're trying to be sensitive."" Minus the exercise, I can relate from a few islands away. I, too, booked an impromptu trip, in my case to St. John, a few days after a long-planned family vacation to Israel had to be shelved. In retrospect, the plan -- hatched on a crowded R train home from work -- was far from responsible, though then schools were still in session and my office was open. After our third attempt at a flight home got canceled, my husband took his new mask of frolicking-turtle-print fabric, made by a local who calls himself Iron Man, and hopped a choppy 30-minute ferry to another island to procure a printer and cheap laptop so our daughters could attend online school. I tried to convince vacation property owners that they could indeed rent to us because we had arrived before the government-mandated tourist ban. (Luckily, I didn't have to ask the woman with whom I six-foot-distance-chatted on a hike, who sprinted away when I told her where I'd arrived from five weeks earlier.)

I sometimes feel guilt for not being ""New York strong,"" as Gov. Andrew Cuomo would say (yes, I watch him here too), along with sadness for my city, relief that I didn't bring illness to this hospital-free island and worry about paying my bills after renting a vacation home for three months instead of two weeks. But my time on this island (the two known Covid-19 cases are on the mend) is also a tonic, and I don't take for granted the simpler life of afternoon beach swims and visits to the island's beloved, songwriting organic gardener, Josephine, for her immunity-boosting ""bush tea."" A couple of days before I left New York, the comedian Sarah Silverman flew in there and settled into a rented apartment that her friend Adam Schlesinger had found. They had plans to workshop ""The Bedwetter,"" the musical they'd co-written with Joshua Harmon, based on Ms. Silverman's memoir. The afternoon Broadway went dark, Ms. Silverman, Mr. Schlesinger and the show's director, Anne Kauffman, sat around the rental eating pizza, drinking wine and getting updates on when Linda Lavin, a cast member, would land in the city. ""We figured, well, this is what it is, and eventually when it passes, we'll all be together rehearsing,"" Ms. Silverman later told me. ""That was the last time I socialized in person. And it was the last time I will ever see Adam."" Eighteen days later, Mr. Schlesinger, the frontman of Fountains of Wayne, died of Covid-19 at 52. Ms. Silverman is staying put until at least mid-June, her apartment eerily quiet (""I never realized how many New Yorkers seem to have a place 'upstate.'"") but with a washer and dryer (which, to New Yorkers, may be a bigger brag than a Zoom ocean background). Ms. Silverman also takes in the view every evening, from her vacation balcony, a.k.a. fire escape. ""I live for 7 to 7:03 p.m. when the whole city seems to be howling and banging pots and pans in a collective primal scream."" She is also not rushing to hop on a plane home. ""Against all reason,"" she said. ""I feel safer here.""","Some feel sheepish about their choice to retreat from stricken cities, for intervals that are stretching on. Others have found it liberating.",fd7d10a8-9bc0-55b2-8829-0ac8b275ca52,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/fashion/08VIRUS-STRANDED1/08VIRUS-STRANDED1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3a5d379e0f7d3de4bdbeb54cc55098adf7a24f83903e477e83a5aaac3283bcee&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Josh Anchors in Bali,fd7d10a8-9bc0-55b2-8829-0ac8b275ca52,N24News/imgs/fd7d10a8-9bc0-55b2-8829-0ac8b275ca52.jpg,15
Economy,Trump Move on Job Training Brings 'Skills Gap' Debate to the Fore,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/business/economy/trump-job-training-skills-gap.html,"President Trump is taking one of the most concrete steps of his presidency on Thursday to address the employment prospects of workers left behind by the current economic expansion. In doing so, he also joins a long-running and occasionally contentious debate over whether those workers have the skills they need to land desirable jobs. Mr. Trump's action comes in the form of an executive order expanding federally funded apprenticeship programs. The order would create a category of programs that industry groups and other third parties could develop and then submit for Labor Department approval, rather than working within existing department guidelines. ""Apprenticeships place students into great jobs without the crippling debt of traditional four-year college degrees,"" Mr. Trump said. ""Instead apprentices earn while they learn."" Mr. Trump would redirect over $100 million of federal job training money to pay for the new apprenticeships, supplementing $90 million in funding for the existing program.

Corporate groups hailed the idea of expanding apprenticeship programs and making them more flexible, arguing that apprenticeships are a reliable path to good-paying jobs in sectors like retail and hospitality for those who could no longer support themselves in production sectors like manufacturing. ""We applaud the Department of Labor and the administration for being willing to look at how to craft this in a way that brings apprenticeships to a new range of audiences,"" said Rob Gifford, executive vice president of the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation, which oversees the industry group's apprenticeship programs. Mr. Gifford gave credit to the Obama administration for making industries like his eligible for apprenticeship funding. The restaurant industry group won a contract worth up to about $9.75 million under the Obama-era program to create apprenticeships that would run from six months to two years and help candidates for management positions acquire skills in such areas as accounting and sanitation practices. But Mr. Gifford said that streamlining regulations could make apprenticeship programs even more effective. The administration's interest in apprenticeships stands in contrast to the cutbacks for other forms of job training in its budget proposal, involving far larger sums. The Association of Community College Trustees said that while it welcomed Thursday's move, it remained worried about ""the severe cuts proposed to federal work force and education programs.""

Underlying the relatively modest size and scope of Mr. Trump's proposal is a much bigger idea about why workers who have lost good-paying jobs that do not require a college degree are struggling to find work at comparable wages. In the eyes of the president and many corporate leaders, the crux of the problem is skills -- the proposition that employers are eager to fill millions of good-paying jobs that workers lack the skills to perform. ""The U.S. faces a serious skills gap,"" Labor Secretary R. Alexander Acosta said during a call with reporters last week, pointing to six million vacant jobs -- the most since the department starting keeping track in the early 2000s. The vacancies were especially abundant in manufacturing, information technology and health care, he said. If the unemployed could acquire the necessary skills through apprenticeships or course work, the thinking goes, companies could quickly fill these jobs, providing workers with economic security and stimulating the economy.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. Despite the belief of some, however, there is little evidence that the economy is suffering from an unusually large skills gap. While economic indicators do show a historically high number of job vacancies, as Mr. Acosta pointed out, research economists tend to believe that the skills gap accounts for, at most, a limited portion of this development. Many experts believe it plays almost no role at all. One way to see this is to hypothetically assign unemployed workers to jobs or industries regardless of their qualifications, essentially assuming away the skills gap. The difference between the hypothetical unemployment rate that results from this exercise and the actual unemployment rate would show the extent to which the skills gap is driving unemployment.

But when you do this, according to Aysegul Sahin, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the size of the skills gap today is unremarkable. ""The level of mismatch at the occupation level is pretty much where it was before the Great Recession,"" she said. Ms. Sahin points to two other factors causing employers to take longer to fill jobs: the aging of the work force and a long-term decline in the proportion of start-ups in the economy. Older businesses tend to grow more slowly and typically take longer to fill vacancies as a result. They often devote more resources to the process and have more bureaucracy overseeing it, such as a human resources department. Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago, helped create an index showing that the average time it takes to fill a job is the longest since January 2001. He believes that a skills gap could be part of the explanation, but he also sees several other factors. For example, he said, employers have better technology and data to screen candidates for drug problems, criminal records or credit problems, prolonging the hiring process. Proponents of the skills gap hypothesis typically contend that the loss of many jobs in manufacturing, for example, is offset by the creation of jobs at comparable pay that the same workers could perform with somewhat more training. ""Demand is growing for middle-skill workers -- machinists, technicians, health care practitioners and a broad range of other roles,"" Jamie Dimon, the chief executive of JPMorgan Chase, said in a Politico op-ed in 2014. But extensive economic research on the subject suggests essentially the opposite trend: The proportion of middle-skill jobs in the economy has declined since the 1980s, while relative job growth has been concentrated at either the low end of the spectrum, like retail, or the high end, like software development, a related phenomenon economists refer to as job-market ""polarization."" The former class of jobs tends to be undesirable for many former factory workers. The latter tends to be out of reach even with additional training.

Consider health care, one of the sectors both Mr. Acosta, the labor secretary, and Mr. Dimon alluded to as a promising source of middle-skill jobs for retrained workers. Of the six million vacancies Mr. Acosta cited in the overall labor market, one million were in the health care sector as of April, the latest month for which data is available. But the industry hired only about a half-million workers that month -- the largest absolute gap of any sector between vacancies and hires. Some of these jobs are in fact good-paying middle-skill jobs, like diagnostic medical sonographers. The same is true in areas like retail and hospitality, where workers can earn a reasonable living by getting on the management track. Apprenticeships, which have been shown to lead to higher-paying jobs, may well help more workers land these jobs. But about 70 percent of the health care jobs that the Labor Department predicts will exist in 2024 and classifies among the fastest-growing occupations in the economy paid a median wage of less than $26,000 in 2016 -- primarily home health care aides and personal care aides. By contrast, many of the high-paying jobs, like nurse practitioners and nurse midwives, require college or post-college degrees. So the potential for skills-building to fill many of the economy's job vacancies is limited. ""I don't want to say the skill-mismatch problem is irrelevant -- it certainly isn't if you think about a 45-year-old who loses a job in a traditional industry and needs to find a new job,"" said Gordon Hanson, an economist at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied job-market polarization. ""But we do have abundant evidence that there are just fewer of those middle-skilled jobs available.""","With millions of jobs unfilled, the president seeks to expand apprenticeships. But many economists say training is not a factor in most vacancies.",9c184dd8-d3e7-5491-964b-c656151183d6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/16/business/16LABOR1/16LABOR1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=26d2b313731fc4d335d070b313cca85bf76f9c6c6eb61678d1151de41804f2a2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Trump with his daughter Ivanka Trump and Gov.

Music,Peggy Gou Is Kicking Her Electronic Music Career to the Next Level,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/arts/music/peggy-gou-dj-kicks.html,"The South Korean producer and D.J. Peggy Gou was still lugging around four big bags filled with CDs and vinyl records in 2017, long after other D.J.s had gone digital. She knew exactly what tracks were on each disc and didn't want to fumble around during sets, which make her nervous enough as it is. Her baggage was also a buffer against skepticism. In a genre filled with dudes ready to question a musician's bona fides, it was a tangible (and heavy) symbol of her knowledge. ""I was scared to change,"" she said. Gou, 28, who makes bright, danceable electronic music that is catchy and memorable, even to genre newcomers, is less afraid now. This year, she started a label, Gudu Records, and a fashion line called Kirin; released a critically acclaimed EP; and booked prime slots at Glastonbury and Primavera Sound, among other big European festivals. And last month , she became the 69th producer to release a mix for the DJ-Kicks series, a decades-old showcase that has hosted names like Carl Craig, Four Tet, Kode9 and Nina Kraviz. Electronic music, like the clubs in which it flourishes, is divided into those who belong and those who don't. Being chosen to captain a DJ-Kicks mix is a consummate sign of belonging that marks Gou's arrival as a potential crossover artist in a world where few such figures exist.

Gou's DJ-Kicks mix reaches into the history of house and techno, as well as her personal history. It includes the earliest track she started work on , the shuffling, sample-heavy ""Hungboo,"" named for the hero of a Korean fairy tale. Since her adolescence, Gou has been a migratory creature, moving first between London and South Korea, and then all over the world. She first arrived in England when she was 14 to study English, and lived with several different guardians. She did not have an easy relationship with any of them. ""They just locked me up in the house and the school so I obviously became a devil,"" she said. ""I became a rebel.""

That sense of rebellion pushed her out dancing nearly every weekend. Back then, she said, she didn't even worry about whether the music was good. The club ""is one of those places where everybody goes for the same reason,"" she said. ""In a club, it doesn't matter who you are, what you do or where you're from."" She moved back to Korea when she was 18, but felt more comfortable in London and, about six months later, decided to study fashion there. In 2011, while out dancing, she discovered deep house, a subtler genre of dance music than the EDM she'd been accustomed to. Albums like Roman Flugel's ""Fatty Folders,"" from 2011 -- a high-water mark for left-field techno -- permanently changed her palate. ""I listened to it and my jaw just dropped,"" she said. After that, ""I became a nerd."" She was encouraged, first to D.J. and then to make her own music, by people with whom she had personal relationships . Her first love, a Kiwi EDM fan whom she met in Korea, taught her to D.J. in 2009. Four years later, a Facebook friend offered to teach her how to use Ableton, the music production software, and she began to create her own tracks. The first draft of ""Hungboo"" was completed in 2014. Two years later, she released a burst of music, including the EP ""Seek for Maktoop,"" on Ninja Tune. Word of her talent started to float through the underground, and she began securing bigger bookings. ""I was seeing her name pop up places,"" said Tim Sweeney, who hosted Gou on his radio show Beats in Space in 2017. ""She was part of the Berlin scene, the names that were always at Panorama bar or Berghain. She did a great D.J. set for us. The one thing that I remember that was different: She only brought CDs.""

Her record covers and the logo for her label Gudu, drawn by the artist Jee-ook Choi, make pop art out of traditional Korean dancing masks. (Gudu means ""shoe"" in Korean, and Peggy Shoe is a popular nickname.) But Gou has another explanation: ""It also means Peggy Gou does,"" she said. There's a tiger lounging on a bed on the cover of her DJ-Kicks mix, which marks a shift in spirit animal for Gou, who has made her love for giraffes so well-known that inflatable ones frequently crowd-surf at her shows. ""Tiger is wild and I'm wild,"" she said. ""And do you know why I like giraffe? I'm the opposite of a giraffe. I'm very hyper and full of energy."" Gou's energy is obvious in her music, and she is confident in its mass appeal. Asked how to get people who are not normally fans of electronic music into club genres like house and techno, she thought for a moment before alighting on an idea. ""Do you think it would be too cocky to say maybe try to let them hear what I do?"" she asked. ""I don't want to sound like a bighead! But maybe you can say it in a nice, humble way.""","The 28-year-old producer and D.J. started a label and a fashion line, and released a mix for an acclaimed series.",60a9e46d-1ab9-5598-aa3f-7c9c6f039690,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/03/arts/03gou/03gou-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=81c01b7753682450e4c36634baafb196e3310f90182dc539a13be0e8fbfe57fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Peggy Gou learned to D.J. in 2009.

Style,Amar'e Stoudemire Is on a Religious Quest,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/03/style/amare-stoudemire-judaism.html,"The halls of the Jewish Museum in Manhattan were hushed and dim as Amar'e Stoudemire stepped inside. At nearly seven feet tall, the former New York Knicks star towered over the smattering of other visitors. With furrowed brow, he considered dozens of Jewish relics on display: a chunk of carved third-century marble, twinkling candelabra and a carved wooden chest for keeping the Torah, the sacred scrolls of Judaism. Mr. Stoudemire had just announced, only hours earlier, hopes of returning to the N.B.A. after leaving two years ago, but he'd reserved the afternoon for showing his spiritual side.

At 35, he is part sports mogul, part holy man. With some 15 years as a basketball star, Mr. Stoudemire has stepped out as an entrepreneur, dipping into the art and fashion worlds, opening a winery and publishing a series of books. He is also taking what he frequently calls a ""spiritual journey"" into the Bible, Israel and Judaism. It's a turn that has fascinated and confounded some observers. A museum employee hurried behind Mr. Stoudemire to point out pieces of interest, sprinkling her sentences with Yiddish and craning to make eye contact. But Mr. Stoudemire seemed at ease among the cases of Judaica, explaining items to two friends and his wife, Alexis Welch, who accompanied him. Walking past a collection of ritual rams' horns from the 18th century, one friend asked, ""Have you ever played one, Amar'e?"" Mr. Stoudemire nodded. ""It takes practice to find the right channel,"" he said, ""but it's a profound sound."" Mr. Stoudemire was raised in a churchgoing home but has long felt more of an affinity for the ancient Hebrews of the Bible than for modern-day Christians. He has made a dozen pilgrimages to Israel, the first in 2010 (and would one day like to move there), and studies Torah daily, peppering his social media feed with Hebrew words and phrases. He also uses a biblical moniker, Yehosaphat. This name was splashed in big white letters on the black leather jacket he wore to the museum. Two necklaces glittered on his chest; one, a Hebrew menorah, the other, a Jesus medallion.

His faith mixes elements of Christianity and Judaism and draws deeply from Hebrew Israelite traditions -- a complex set of faith groups bound together by a belief that African-Americans are the true descendants of the biblical Israelites. ""I'm an Israelite. That's just who I am,"" he said. Around 2012, the same year he married his longtime girlfriend and was mourning the death of his older brother, Mr. Stoudemire delved deeper into religious study. He became involved in a Jesus-worshiping Hebrew Israelite organization, Israel of God, where he was baptized in 2013; he has also been studying alongside Jewish rabbis since around that same time. Mr. Stoudemire seems undeterred by religious gatekeepers who might discourage such exploration. ""I study with elders, with rabbis, with everyone,"" he said. ""I don't limit myself.""

And Mr. Stoudemire's faith has animated his professional forays. In 2014, he produced a documentary, ""Village of Peace,"" about a longtime Hebrew Israelite community in Dimona, Israel. Mr. Stoudemire calls his mushrooming private miscellany of art -- including a Jean-Michel Basquiat canvas, among some 70 other pieces -- the Melech Collection, using a Hebrew word for king. A new addition to this collection is a 45-foot mural depicting the fiery siege of Jerusalem's Second Temple in A.D. 70. (The piece, ""The Temple Within,"" by the artist Steven Cogle, was unveiled at Scope Miami Beach in December.) And his new wine label, Stoudemire Cellars, released three new bottles in time for Passover this year: a cabernet sauvignon and other blends of red, all kosher and made from grapes crushed at an Israeli vineyard. Mr. Stoudemire also hosts an internet course on the popular legends of the biblical Lost Tribes of Israel.

Sitting, slightly hunched, with his entourage at the Russ & Daughters cafe in the basement of the museum, Mr. Stoudemire picked at his salad with a fork. Across from him, Ms. Welch ate an everything bagel with thick slabs of lox. ""You just can't go wrong with this,"" she said. When he was in his 20s, and during eight seasons with the Phoenix Suns, Mr. Stoudemire was a dynamic and oft-copied player. In 2010, he signed a lucrative and much-hyped deal with the Knicks but suffered a series of debilitating knee injuries in the following years. He left the N.B.A. in 2016 to play professionally in Israel for the team Hapoel Jerusalem, in which he had an ownership stake. (In farewell notes, Mr. Stoudemire insisted his departure wasn't about ""collecting a paycheck overseas"" but returning to what he saw as his ancestral homeland.) His move was a coup for the Jerusalem club, and the Stoudemire family was treated like royalty by locals. But there were also tensions overseas with the head coach and referees, as well as a flare-up over comments he made about how he would react to a gay teammate. (Mr. Stoudemire later apologized.) Though Mr. Stoudemire led Hapoel to victory in the 2017 Israeli Premier League championship, his contract wasn't immediately renewed. Hapoel has expressed renewed interest in recent weeks, and if an N.B.A. offer fails to materialize, Mr. Stoudemire could return to Jerusalem. After the museum, the group was chauffeured downtown in a shiny black S.U.V to J. Levine Judaica & Books, a cluttered shop for religious objects that holds sentimental value for Ms. Welch and Mr. Stoudemire. On the occasion of the couple's New York rooftop wedding in 2012, Mr. Stoudemire picked up a new Jewish prayer shawl from this shop. Danny Levine, the shop's longtime owner, greeted the couple dressed in a suit and wide patterned tie. ""Welcome to Jewish New York,"" he said, spreading his arms out with a showman's flair. ""Since 1905!""",Accompanying the former N.B.A. star as he explores Jewish landmarks in New York.,8f77171f-8526-5f5a-ad62-0f5a0c8492dd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/fashion/05AMARE-1/merlin_138656556_2f1cfcc3-2224-49c6-8af2-edc6c3065619-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a0c9497296a0f75a04d96b9e478ac5910377001d0cd63f78cdc6f60ab0b72d21&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Amar'e Stoudemire attempts to blow a shofar at J.

Sports,The Olympics Want Tiger Woods. He Wants to Go. But There's a Catch.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/20/sports/golf/tiger-woods-Olympics.html,"The Olympics Want Tiger Woods. He Wants to Go. But There's a Catch. 
* None  

In November 2008, two officials from the International Golf Federation traveled to Switzerland to make a case for returning their sport's athletes to the Olympics after a century-long hiatus. But as the men made their presentation to members of the International Olympic Committee, they quickly realized they were pitching to an audience fixated on a single player. Never mind the sport's global reach or its charitable impact and cornerstone values of honesty and fair play. To Ty Votaw, who was helping make golf's case for inclusion, it was clear from the start what the I.O.C. considered golf's greatest asset. ""The very first question asked was, 'Will Tiger Woods play?'"" Votaw said. Twelve years later, the Olympics still covet Woods -- now, perhaps, more than ever. The problem is that there may not be a spot for him. In 2008, Woods's participation seemed foreordained. He stood alongside Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps as one of the world's most dominant athletes, and was coming off a season that had included his 14th major title. For the 10th time in 11 years, he ended the year ranked No. 1. Woods, with his star power, and the Olympics, with their global stage, looked like a marriage brokered in a corporate boardroom. Yet while Woods's spirit was willing, a back injury sidelined him for most of 2016, sinking his hopes of qualifying for that summer's competition in Rio de Janeiro. Golf returned to the Games without him, and the Englishman Justin Rose won the gold medal. Now, four years later, Woods is the closest he has been to the Olympics since he attended an archery event at the 1984 Games in Los Angeles with his father. To qualify, he must be one of the top four American players ranked inside the world top 15 as of June 22. Woods is currently seventh in the world, but he is only the fifth-best American heading into this week's Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego. At the moment, Brooks Koepka, Justin Thomas, Dustin Johnson and Patrick Cantlay hold the four Olympic tournament places reserved for Americans. Woods, 44, spoke last fall of his desire to participate in the Tokyo Games, describing it as a ""once-in-a-lifetime experience."" ""And especially at the age I'll be, I don't know if I have many more chances,"" he said. Woods is no stranger to international competition, having played in the Ryder Cup and the Presidents Cup. It may comfort Woods that in the post-World War II era, two United States Olympians, the sailors Paul Smart in 1948 and Everard Endt in 1952, have won gold medals in their 50s. So it's not necessarily now or never for him. But for an Olympic movement ravaged by the cancers of corruption and cheating, and reeling from the retirements of Bolt and Phelps, there would be no time like the present to plug into Woods's transcendence. ""I know TV companies for obvious reasons are excited about it,"" said Peter Dawson, the International Golf Federation's president. So, it would appear, is the host country. In October, roughly 60 miles from the Olympic venue, Japanese fans cheered louder for Woods than they did their native son, Hideki Matsuyama, at the inaugural Zozo Championship, which Woods won wire to wire. Yes, Woods is currently the odd man out among Americans. But that is, as Dawson joked, ""nothing that another Masters win wouldn't cure."" In 2016, the top four men in line to headline the Olympic field -- Jason Day, Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy and Johnson -- chose not to compete for reasons that included the fear of contracting the mosquito-borne Zika virus. This year, it's possible an American player or two could be sidelined by something else: money. The men's competition in Tokyo will take place two weeks after the British Open and two weeks before the start of the three-tournament FedEx Cup playoffs, which offer a $60 million total purse, including a $15 million payoff to the eventual winner. The first playoff event is outside Boston, 14 time zones from Tokyo, and so it is not unthinkable that a top player, prioritizing majors over medals or playoff riches over Olympic gold, might decide that it's not worth making the round-the-world journey to Japan at such a key moment in his season. Could somebody also stay home because of outside pressure to step aside to make room for Woods? ""There may be some of that,"" Dawson said, though he quickly added, ""I'm sure Tiger wouldn't want to get into the Games that way."" It has happened before, though. At the 2004 Australian swimming trials, the superstar Ian Thorpe, the world-record holder and reigning Olympic champion in the 400-meter freestyle, was disqualified from his heat for a false start after he lost his balance on the blocks and fell into the water. The top two finishers in the final qualified for the Athens Games, and scores of Australians soon were publicly calling on Craig Stevens, the runner-up, to relinquish his spot to Thorpe. There was no danger that Stevens or Thorpe would miss the Games; both had qualified in other events. But a month later, during a televised interview for which he was paid a six-figure sum, Stevens announced that he was ceding his spot in the 400 freestyle to Thorpe, who went on to successfully defend his Olympic title. For the moment, Woods still controls his fate. After his victory last year at the Masters, he described the Olympics as ""a big goal,"" but he admitted ""getting there and making the team is going to be the tough part."" One option, Woods acknowledged, was that he might have to play more than he would like in the first half of 2020 in the pursuit of Olympic qualifying points. A strong finish this week, at an event he has won seven times, would be a great start. ""I just know that if I play well in the big events like I did this year,"" Woods said last year, ""things will take care of itself.""","Golf was restored to the Games, in part, to forge an association with stars like Woods. But with a few months left to qualify, he is on the outside looking in.",f23f8dc3-1fcb-51ca-bf3f-00f83ac01251,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/20/sports/20tiger-top/20tiger-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3517eece465b27add760294d1d3e81691cbeb69660461d6d170d9fd63eafd867&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tiger Woods missed golf's return to the Olympics in 2016, but is eager to play in Tokyo this year.",f23f8dc3-1fcb-51ca-bf3f-00f83ac01251,N24News/imgs/f23f8dc3-1fcb-51ca-bf3f-00f83ac01251.jpg,9

Real Estate,Fancy Swimming Pools as Building Perks,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/realestate/fancy-swimming-pools-as-building-perks.html,"For those of us who slog on the subway to Rockaway for a dip in the ocean, or sit in traffic en route to weekend houses by the water, the idea of having a pool in our apartment buildings might sound like the ultimate luxury. Simply push an elevator button and, moments later, dive in.

But for certain rarefied strata of residential real estate in New York, a pool is becoming common. And pools in new or soon-to-open buildings go way beyond the basic. Some have been elevated from the usual location in the basement to ground level or higher, opening up to gardens and skyline views. Many are long enough for lap swimming, embellished with fancy finishes and flanked by lounge chairs.

""A pool gives an aura to a building,"" said James Lansill, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group.

Some developers are going to significant lengths to provide that allure, even shoehorning pools into existing buildings during conversions. At 135 West 52nd Street, a condominium created in a building that previously housed the Flatotel, the Chetrit Group and Clipper Equity took basement space that the hotel had used for offices and filled it with a lap pool with a wall of backlit glass painted to resemble onyx. At another condo, 88 & 90 Lex, a merger of a 1927 building and a 1958 building, the HFZ Capital Group is installing an L-shape pool for the joined buildings to share.",Pools in some new apartment buildings have been elevated from their usual basement locations or embellished with high-end finishes.,f8d25cfc-2ce9-506c-849e-8674fd45d128,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/24/realestate/24POOLS1/24POOLS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=ec40462ca5bad24d28abb53a08cc10a12e6a42346c9b0f07ce5f015112bf74fb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A rooftop pool at QLIC in Long Island City offers Manhattan views.,f8d25cfc-2ce9-506c-849e-8674fd45d128,N24News/imgs/f8d25cfc-2ce9-506c-849e-8674fd45d128.jpg,7
Books,"Liane Moriarty's New Novel, Set at a Spa, Features Some Killer Treatments",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/books/review/liane-moriarty-nine-perfect-strangers.html,"The perfect foil for the formidable Masha, and the standout spa-goer, is Frances Welty. Frances is a middle-aged romance novelist who's feeling terrible about herself after her publisher rejected her new manuscript, a reviewer hated her latest book and an online con man broke her heart in a catfishing scam. Frances may be down on her luck, and herself, but her warm sense of humor makes her completely relatable. At the pool, trying to impress another spa-goer, ""she wanted to convey strength in all her future interactions with this man, and her soft white body ... didn't convey much except 52 years of good living and a weakness for chocolate Lindt balls."" Frances describes the mandatory smoothies as ""green sludge"" and even tries to smuggle chocolate into Tranquillum House, acknowledging: ""This was rock-bottom. She'd just licked a Kit Kat wrapper.""

The other characters are also fully realized, with compelling lives, relationships and motivations. They include a sports marketing consultant, a husband and wife who won the lottery and are trying to salvage their marriage, a health-spa junkie (""I indulge and atone, indulge and atone""), a once-famous athlete and a recently divorced mother of four. An especially poignant story line follows another married couple, Heather and Napoleon, and their 20-year-old daughter, Zoe, who are all grieving the suicide of Zoe's twin brother, Zach. A subplot like that can veer into melodrama, but Moriarty handles it deftly. For example, when Zoe is asked about her upcoming birthday, she answers simply: ""I don't celebrate on that day anymore. I kind of changed my birthday.""

To divulge what happens next would spoil a major plot twist, though readers are given a tiny hint early on when Masha asks Frances how she likes the book she is reading. ""Frances thought about this.

Travel,What Tituss Burgess Can't Travel Without,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/10/travel/tituss-burgess-netflix-unbreakable-kimmy-schmidt.html,"The actor and singer Tituss Burgess has appeared in many Broadway productions over his 14-year career, but he may be most famous as the scene-stealing Titus Andromedon in the television show ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt."" The final episodes of the show, for which Mr. Burgess has received four Emmy nominations, began streaming last month on Netflix.

Because he travels frequently for work, Mr. Burgess's ideal vacation is a staycation. ""I truly don't like to go anywhere,"" he says. ""But sometimes I'll seek out the newest hotel in New York, and my partner and I will have a staycation. You know, we just choose a new area, whether it's downtown, South Street Seaport, the East Side, something like that. I suppose that counts as traveling because in New York getting anywhere takes a half an hour.""

While he calls New York City his home, it's only on these staycations that Mr. Burgess takes time to check out new restaurants and theater productions. ""New York has everything to offer but when you live here and you're dealing with the everyday -isms and eccentricities of the city, you may or may not have energy to take advantage of all the wonderful things that tourists take advantage of. Or you want to but are too exhausted by the time you're done doing your day.""

Mr. Burgess has a list of things that make a staycation perfect. ""We'll have the champagne already in the room before we check in so that we don't have to do that when we get there,"" he says. ""We'll probably run a bath, then our masseuse will be ready. It's just quite literally less is more on our vacations: fancy bubbly, a massage, a Broadway show, food and lots of sleep.""","The Emmy-nominated actor and singer prefers staycations in New York City.

Science,"Peter Mansfield, M.R.I. Pioneer and Nobel Laureate, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/11/science/peter-mansfield-dead-nobel-prize-magnetic-resonance-imaging.html,"Sir Peter Mansfield, who shared a Nobel Prize for discoveries that underpinned the invention of magnetic resonance imaging, the method of peering inside the human body that revolutionized medicine, died on Wednesday. He was 83. The University of Nottingham in England, where Dr. Mansfield had been a professor of physics, announced his death but not did say where he died. He lived in England. Magnetic resonance imaging, or M.R.I., has enabled doctors to diagnose and examine injuries to ligaments, bones and organs without cutting open the body or risking the radiation dangers of X-rays. ""It's hugely important,"" said Charles P. Slichter, an emeritus physics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. ""It's such an all-pervasive technique."" Dr. Mansfield worked in his laboratory as a postdoctoral researcher in the 1960s.

Dr. Mansfield was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2003, along with Paul C. Lauterbur, a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The two had worked independent of each other in studying magnetic resonance imaging. Their research proceeded from an understanding that the nuclei of most atoms act as tiny magnets that line up when placed in a magnetic field. If the field is set at a specific strength, the atoms can absorb and emit radio waves. Scientists initially used the technique, called nuclear magnetic resonance, or N.M.R., to study atoms and molecules, deducing properties from the emitted waves. In his early research, Dr. Mansfield developed N.M.R. techniques to study crystals. Later, in 1972, as he worked to refine and sharpen N.M.R. data, he had a conversation with two colleagues about what applications such advances might lead to. He soon realized that if an object were placed in a nonuniform magnetic field -- one that is stronger at one end than the other -- scientists might be able to piece together a three-dimensional image of its atomic structure. When Dr. Mansfield presented this research at a scientific conference the next year, an audience member asked him how his work compared to findings by Dr. Lauterbur that had been recently published in the journal Nature. Dr. Mansfield said he was not aware of that work.

Both scientists had developed techniques for turning N.M.R. data into images -- Dr. Lauterbur while he was at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. When N.M.R. imaging became common for medical use, the name was changed to magnetic resonance imaging; the word ""nuclear"" was dropped for fear that patients might think radioactive elements were being used. Dr. Mansfield built a prototype of a magnetic resonance imaging machine in 1978, and he volunteered to be the first person to be enclosed in it and scanned, even though some scientists worried that its nonuniform magnetic field could induce cardiac fibrillation. ""He was the guinea pig,"" said Richard Bowtell, a professor at Nottingham, who had been one of Dr. Mansfield's graduate students. ""He went into the scanner. There was the worry it would knock him dead."" Dr. Mansfield's own calculations indicated no danger. ""In fact, the scan went well, and after fifty minutes and sweltering heat, I got out of the machine dripping like a wet rag,"" he wrote in his 2013 autobiography, ""The Long Road to Stockholm: The Story of M.R.I."" Dr. Mansfield went on to seek faster scans that could capture the beating of a heart. He developed a technique called echo-planar imaging, which could assemble an image in less than a second instead of minutes or hours. His techniques enabled scientists to take a rapid-fire succession of images that tracked the movement of internal organs. That led to another advance called functional M.R.I., which depicts activity in the brain.

""He worked on it for 10 years before it took off,"" Dr. Bowtell said. ""He was very driven. He was very able to follow an idea in the face of adversity."" Peter Mansfield was born in London on Oct. 9, 1933. Partly because of a reorganization of the British school system, he did not finish high school. A guidance counselor asked him what he wanted to do. ""Well, actually, I wouldn't mind being a scientist,"" Dr. Mansfield recalled saying. The counselor, incredulous, suggested that he seek a more practical vocation. At 15, he became a printer's apprentice and took classes five evenings a week to complete his secondary education. In the newspaper one day, he read an article about how someone had achieved his schoolboy dream of becoming a rocketeer. Intrigued, he wrote to the newspaper asking how he might become a rocketeer, too. He was advised to send an application to the government. Impressed with him, officials at the government's Rocket Propulsion Department hired him to be an assistant. He resigned his printer apprenticeship. That job was interrupted by two years of military service. Then, at 23, he entered Queen Mary College at the University of London. He completed his undergraduate degree in 1959 and then a doctoral degree in physics, also at Queen Mary, in 1962. During college, his interest shifted from rockets to physics and nuclear magnetic resonance. He worked with Dr. Slichter for two years at the University of Illinois before obtaining a faculty position at the University of Nottingham in 1964. He was a fellow of the Royal Society, London, and knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1993. Survivors include his wife, Jean; two daughters, Sarah and Gillian; and four grandchildren. After Dr. Mansfield received the Nobel Prize, Dr. Slichter reminded him that no award, no matter how prestigious, could compare to the satisfaction of advancing medicine and saving lives. Dr. Slichter told him, ""What you've done is much more important than a Nobel.""",Dr. Mansfield's discoveries enabled doctors to diagnose and examine injuries without exposing the patient to radiation or cutting open the body.,e5455350-880f-50f7-9c89-4a5dd5c6075a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/12/world/12mansfield-obit/12mansfield-obit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=4f6f610618422e49478dd9f122f481057ac834011e2df282a1240780ade93335&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Peter Mansfield built an M.R.I. machine in 1978 and was the first person to be scanned by it.

Real Estate,Merchants Wait for the Promise of Vanderbilt Avenue. And Wait.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/realestate/merchants-wait-for-the-promise-of-vanderbilt-avenue-and-wait.html,"For over a decade, Ellen Fishman has been waiting for business to improve at Amorina Cucina Rustica, the restaurant she owns with her husband on Vanderbilt Avenue in Brooklyn. Her pizzeria sits in the shadow of the $4.9 billion megadevelopment once known as Atlantic Yards, which has promised to deliver thousands of new residents and visitors to the area since it was proposed in 2003. But so far, the biggest change Ms. Fishman and other Vanderbilt Avenue merchants have seen is rising rent. The project has been troubled by delays, financial setbacks, lawsuits and political wrangling. And the opening of the Barclays Center, the centerpiece of the development, in 2012, did not deliver substantial new business to Vanderbilt, despite expectations that it would. All the while, Prospect Heights merchants on Vanderbilt, on the southeastern edge of the development, have been waiting for thousands of new residents to settle at the 22-acre development, now called Pacific Park Brooklyn, and stream into their shops.

This fall, the first residential tower will open, and others will soon follow. Ms. Fishman hopes that a payoff might finally come. ""Everybody is really having their fingers crossed,"" she said. ""I'm sure there are a few businesses that are really hanging on by a thread, waiting for this bump up.""

Retail rents have been rising in anticipation that the project will change the character of the stretch of Vanderbilt that runs from Atlantic Avenue to Grand Army Plaza. Hair salons and hardware stores have been replaced with artisanal bakeries and farm-to-table restaurants. Some storefronts have remained vacant as landlords wait for higher-paying tenants. Even some newer stores have struggled to survive, according to the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council and Ms. Fishman, president of the Vanderbilt Avenue Merchants District. But shopkeepers found that after the Barclays Center -- home to the Islanders and the Nets, at Atlantic and Flatbush Avenues -- opened, sports fans and concertgoers simply did not walk the 15 minutes to Vanderbilt Avenue to eat. Also, construction of the 14 residential buildings, originally scheduled to finish by this year, stalled. But the retailers' rents rose anyway.

""Nobody projected it was going to take 12 years,"" said Gib Veconi, the chairman of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Development Council. ""A lot of those neighborhood entrepreneurs who were here in the early part of the last decade haven't been able to hold on."" Ms. Fishman and her husband, Albano Ballerini, own a separate building on Vanderbilt with a storefront. Retail brokers told her to ask $10,000 a month for the small, 750-square-foot space. ""It was absurd. Who could possibly do that?"" she said. Instead, the couple rented it at a fraction of what the brokers suggested to Daly Pie, a bakery cafe that opened in June. Since the project's developer, Greenland Forest City Partners, agreed two years ago to build the affordable apartments faster, residential buildings have been rising. In all, the project will contain 6,430 apartments, including 2,250 affordable units to be completed by 2025. The first tower, a 32-story rental at 461 Dean Street, opens this fall. A 17-story condominium, 550 Vanderbilt, with about 250 apartments will open by next year. So too will 535 Carlton, an 18-story rental with almost 300 apartments. Another tower, 38 Sixth Avenue at Dean Street, will open in 2017 with about 300 apartments. When complete, the project is expected to add more than 13,000 residents to the area. ""If you're a restaurateur and you just make ends meet, suddenly you have an opportunity to make real money,"" said Ofer Cohen, the president of TerraCRG, a real estate brokerage based in Prospect Heights. ""And I feel like it's already started to happen.""

Ms. Fishman and Mr. Ballerini, who opened their restaurant 11 years ago, would like to start serving lunch and hope their delivery business will spike as new tenants order pizza. The buildings will also bring new businesses to the area. The project includes 247,000 square feet of retail. A large portion of that will eventually be housed in an office tower planned for a site opposite the Barclays Center. Most of the residential buildings will include some retail space, too, adding new space for smaller shops on Vanderbilt Avenue and Dean Street. Four storefronts will open at 535 Carlton, totaling 9,000 square feet, and 550 Vanderbilt will have 7,000 square feet of retail. A 26-story tower, 615 Dean, which broke ground in December, will have space for two stores when it opens. Many of the storefronts will face Dean Street, which runs parallel to Atlantic Avenue and has minimal retail. ""Dean Street will be literally forming its identity,"" said Peter Levitan, a principal at Lee & Associates, a commercial real estate brokerage. Greenland Forest City is courting smaller, locally owned businesses. Storefronts that open onto a landscaped park space would most likely house a restaurant or cafe. Others could suit a small grocery store, a pet store or a child care center, said Susi Yu, the executive vice president of development at Forest City Ratner, which was the sole developer before it sold a 70 percent stake of the project in 2014 to Greenland USA, a subsidiary of the Chinese company Greenland Group. ""The goal is not to have big-box retail here,"" said Scott Solish, manager of development for Greenland USA. ""The strategy is to complement what's here.""","Rents are rising in anticipation of the Pacific Park Brooklyn project, but it has been troubled by delays, financial setbacks and political wrangling.",c6b3e59c-40e6-58bc-a324-88bba0551618,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/30/business/31VANDERBILTAVE3/31VANDERBILTAVE3-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7239ce124b87259f09ee9ab3d913548327dd5ba10b7e4f6af98d55ecbd029e29&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,535 Carlton is a still-unfinished 18-story building that should open this fall with nearly 300 apartments for rent.

Science,"Jerome S. Bruner, Who Shaped Understanding of the Young Mind, Dies at 100",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/09/science/jerome-s-bruner-who-shaped-understanding-of-the-young-mind-dies-at-100.html,"Jerome S. Bruner, whose theories about perception, child development and learning informed education policy for generations and helped launch the modern study of creative problem solving, known as the cognitive revolution, died on Sunday at his home in Manhattan. He was 100. His death was confirmed by his partner, Eleanor M. Fox. Dr. Bruner was a researcher at Harvard in the 1940s when he became impatient with behaviorism, then a widely held theory, which viewed learning in terms of stimulus and response: the chime of a bell before mealtime and salivation, in Ivan Pavlov's famous dog experiments. Dr. Bruner believed that behaviorism, rooted in animal experiments, ignored many dimensions of human mental experience. In one 1947 experiment, he found that children from low-income households perceived a coin to be larger than it actually was -- their desires apparently shaping not only their thinking but also the physical dimensions of what they saw. In subsequent work, he argued that the mind is not a passive learner -- not a stimulus-response machine -- but an active one, bringing a full complement of motives, instincts and intentions to shape comprehension, as well as perception. His writings -- in particular the book ""A Study of Thinking"" (1956), written with Jacqueline J. Goodnow and George A. Austin -- inspired a generation of psychologists and helped break the hold of behaviorism on the field.

To build a more complete theory, he and the experimentalist George A. Miller, a Harvard colleague, founded the Center for Cognitive Studies, which supported investigation into the inner workings of human thought. Much later, this shift in focus from behavior to information processing came to be known as the cognitive revolution. ""He was a psychologist of possibilities,"" said Howard Gardner, a professor of psychology at Harvard. ""He opened one door of the mind after another, and then moved on to something different."" Dr. Gardner added, ""He was the most important contributor to educational thinking since John Dewey -- and there is no one like him today."" Dr. Bruner's work made him a sought-after expert on development and education. In the late 1950s, after the Soviet Union launched Sputnik, the first satellite in space, officials and prominent educators called for a deeper commitment to education, particularly in the sciences.

In 1959, federal science agencies convened a meeting of top scholars at Woods Hole, in Massachusetts, to brainstorm about possible reforms. Dr. Bruner, who ran the meeting, summarized participants' views in ""The Process of Education"" (1960), a book that quickly became a landmark text in education reform and theory. ""We begin with the hypothesis that any subject can be taught effectively in some intellectually honest form to any child at any age of development,"" Dr. Bruner wrote, in what would become one of the most widely quoted lines in education circles. One idea that emerged from the meeting was the ""spiral curriculum,"" in which teachers introduce students to topics early, in age-appropriate language, and revisit the same subjects in subsequent years, adding depth and complexity. Many school districts have incorporated that approach, beginning in grade school. Later, Dr. Bruner drew on his experience at Woods Hole to help design Head Start, the federal program introduced in 1965 to improve preschool development. In 1972, Dr. Bruner took a position at Oxford University, where, always intellectually restless, he began arguing that cognitive psychology should be broadened to include narrative construction and culture, which also shape the strategies people use to make sense of the world. ""Through Jerome Bruner, the cognitive revolution hit educational thinking, in the United States and around the world,"" said Patricia Greenfield, a professor of psychology at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a former student of his. Jerome Seymour Bruner was born in Manhattan on Oct. 1, 1915, the youngest of three children of Herman and Rose Bruner, who had immigrated from Poland. His father worked as a watchmaker, among other jobs, and his mother managed the household. He also had an older half brother.

Born blind because of cataracts, he had an experimental operation to restore his vision at age 2. The memory of that explosion of sight and color never left him, friends said, and guided his later thinking about how the mind shapes perception. So, too, did social adaptation: His father died when Jerome was 12, and his mother moved the family to Florida, where he attended a series of high schools. Dr. Bruner graduated from Duke University with a degree in psychology in 1937 before entering a doctoral program at Harvard, where he met his first wife, Katherine Frost. The marriage ended in divorce, as did his second marriage. His third wife, Carol Feldman, died before him. Besides Dr. Fox, a professor at New York University School of Law, Dr. Bruner is survived by a son, Whitley, and a daughter, Jane Bruner Mullane, both from his first marriage, as well as three grandchildren. Dr. Bruner wrote or co-wrote a dozen influential books and won a long list of awards in psychology and education. In the 1990s, he became an educational ambassador of sorts, working with preschools in Reggio Emilia, an Italian town near Bologna, and elsewhere. A number of preschools around the world use the Reggio Emilia approach, inspired by Dr. Bruner's work there. He finished his career at N.Y.U. as a law professor, using his ideas about thinking, culture and storytelling to analyze legal reasoning and punishment. He retired in 2013. ""He was an anthropologist, really, never comfortable in one field or with one theory,"" Dr. Fox said. ""He was always looking for broader connections.""","Dr. Bruner's writings, which helped reduce the influence of behaviorism on psychology, were vastly influential on education policy.",4861f9b0-875c-5083-b87c-cfe308776abf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/09/us/09bruner-obit/09bruner-obit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b0327b53701c0dcf87aae753602c850c4397d96fc1b4257596a0e7b8bce11865&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jerome S.

Style,"LeBron James, a Fan of Tacos, Seeks to Trademark 'Taco Tuesday'",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/style/lebron-james-taco-tuesday-trademark.html,"""It has nothing to do with stopping others from using the ter m,"" a spokesman for the basketball star said.

It's an undisputed fact that LeBron James loves tacos, especially on Tuesdays. And this Tuesday night, for seemingly the thousandth time, the millennial N.B.A. superstar went on Instagram and announced to his tens of millions of followers: ""You know what it is! Taco Tuesdayyyyyy!"" This is how he lets people know it is his family's taco night. Mr. James's custom usually includes the addition of a howl delivered in an exaggerated Spanish or Mexican-ish accent. His fans love it. And now the 34-year-old forward for the Los Angeles Lakers is making a move to formalize a claim on the phrase. On Aug. 15, a company called LBJ Trademarks LLC filed a request with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office on behalf of Mr. James to trademark ""Taco Tuesday."" The company seeks protection for use of the phrase in a host of forums, including ""downloadable audio/visual works,"" podcasts, social media, online marketing and ""entertainment services."" USA Today first reported on the request this weekend. ""The filing was to protect the company from potential lawsuits should we decide to pursue any ideas, nothing of which is in development,"" a spokesman for Mr. James said this week on (taco) Tuesday. ""It has nothing to do with stopping others from using the term .""

Trouble is, the phrase is already a federal trademark for a company in Wyoming. That trademark is itself a source of dispute and grumbling. At issue, for taco lovers far and wide, is the question: Should anyone hold a trademark for a phrase in liberal usage at Mexican restaurants across the country? A Brief and Shady History of Taco Tuesday Gustavo Arellano, a longtime taco chronicler and author of the book ""Taco U.S.A.,"" has found references to American businesses highlighting tacos or other Mexican foods on Tuesdays as far back as 1933. Now a features writer for The Los Angeles Times, Mr. Arellano chalked up Mr. James's move to a newcomer's naivete. After all, Mr. James is only entering his second season playing for Los Angeles, after playing for teams in other cities. ""In LeBron's defense, he was in Cleveland, he was in Miami -- hardly capitals of Mexican food,"" he said. Mr. Arellano argued that the current trademark for ""Taco Tuesday,"" which has been held since 1989 by the franchise restaurant chain Taco John's, based in Cheyenne, Wyo., is a classic case of ""Columbusing."" Mr. James's effort to claim the term now, he said, could be an opportunity to ""free"" it for use by all. Currently, the U.S. patent office recognizes four trademarks related to tacos and Tuesdays: ""Techno Taco Tuesday,"" for an entertainment company in Las Vegas; ""Tuesdays Were Made for Tacos at Rosa's!"" for a restaurant in Fort Worth; ""Taco Tuesday,"" for the Gregory Hotel in Somers Point, N.J. (applicable only in the state of New Jersey); and the 1989 trademark held by Taco John's (applicable throughout the United States, except in New Jersey).

Twenty-five other filings, including the request by LBJ Trademarks LLC, are pending or dead. Taco John's, which did not respond to a request for comment, has been known to aggressively protect its claim on the term. But policing the use of ""Taco Tuesday"" is likely a futile endeavor: just Google ""Taco Tuesday"" and the name of any medium-sized or larger big city. Hundreds of restaurants, bars, and cantinas use the alliterative phrase to promote taco and drink specials on their menus, flagrantly ignoring a federal trademark. In Los Angeles, which may be the taco capital of the U.S., the news of the N.B.A. champ's filing was met with frowns, guffaws or shrugs. At Trejo's Tacos on La Brea Avenue, it was just another Tuesday on a hot September afternoon. Customers lined up at the taqueria -- founded by the actor and hometown hero Danny Trejo -- to have mini tacos of carnitas, cauliflower or spicy shrimp, for around $2.75 apiece. There's a special Tuesdays-only menu at Trejo's. ""It's a national slogan. To patent it? Come on, give me a break,"" said Valerie Bracamontes, 53, who was dining at Trejo's with three members of her family. ""He definitely doesn't know L.A.,"" she said. For some, Mr. James's affected accent with the ""Taco Tuesday"" gag is a separate source of discomfort. It's been described as cringe-worthy, and possibly a play on the Looney Tunes character Speedy Gonzales. ""If you're going to do a 'grito,'"" or traditional Mexican 'yell,' Mr. Arellano said, ""at least do a good one."" Still, tacos are ""so ingrained in our cultural milieu as Californians that it doesn't even strike people who are non-Mexican necessarily that it is not indigenous to us,"" said Alison Rose Jefferson, a third-generation L.A. native and an independent historian of the African-American experience in Southern California.

That was the vibe on Tuesday afternoon at Worldwide Tacos, a taco shack in South Los Angeles that is legendary for what are often described as soul food tacos . There are more than 150 possible tacos or burritos on the menu, usually a frightening prospect for taco purists from other parts of L.A. The business got a boost last year with a scene on the HBO series ""Insecure"" -- the show's star Issa Rae orders, and then sings to, the B.B.Q. salmon taco -- but wait-times are long, and even its operating hours remain elusive. Customers arrive, leave their order and phone number, and go somewhere else to wait for an hour or more to get pinged when their food is ready. Faithful customers say the waits are worth it. The lamb-and-blueberry taco is another surprising standout. Al Sennie, who was preparing tacos on Tuesday at Worldwide, said Mr. James should not be faulted for his business acumen, ""if he can get away with it."" L.A. will always love the Lakers, he said. But he paused when asked if the trademark request was ill-advised. ""Before he came over here it was already 'Taco Tuesday'"" in Los Angeles, Mr. Sennie said. ""He should come down to Worldwide and really know what Taco Tuesday is all about, and bring the whole team."" Mr. Sennie, making his own potentially exaggerated claim, added: ""These are the best tacos in L.A.""","""It has nothing to do with stopping others from using the term,"" a spokesman for the basketball star said.",a44f9396-a1a7-5c34-83a6-e8fdb0d771e4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/04/fashion/04tacotuesday-promo/04tacotuesday-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2ed56886769ca2544abdac4ffc64f57e244a45f54dc61f7a1d087375d80ac86f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"LeBron James on Sunday, clearly looking forward to Tuesday.",a44f9396-a1a7-5c34-83a6-e8fdb0d771e4,N24News/imgs/a44f9396-a1a7-5c34-83a6-e8fdb0d771e4.jpg,15
Science,"In Many Species, a Family Dinner Means Something Else",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/science/cannibalism-animal-biology.html,"Humans are sometimes said to occupy a ""pecking order,"" but of course the term actually refers to chickens and other poultry. Mild pecking is normal behavior in the flock, employed by dominant birds (or ""despots"") as a way to remind subordinates of their lower social position. But the practice can turn gruesome when thousands of birds are packed wing to wing. Then, some bottom-of-the-order birds are pecked to death -- and eaten. As poultry and egg farms increased in size in the 1920s and 1930s, feather-pecking and cannibalism, known in the trade as ""pick out,"" became serious threats. In 1939, Joseph Haas, founder of the National Band and Tag Company, devised a fashionable method to deal with cooped-up cannibals: mini sunglasses equipped with red celluloid lenses on a hinged aluminum frame. Poultry farmers were informed that having their chickens see the world through rose-tinted cheaters would ""make a sissy of your toughest birds."" Until relatively recently, the party line among scientists was that cannibalism occurred in only a few species in the wild, like black widow spiders and praying mantises. Cannibalism, researchers felt, was an aberrant behavior resulting from a lack of alternative forms of nutrition or the stresses associated with captive conditions.

But over the decades, evidence has been gathering for an alternative view. Cannibalism, it turns out, occurs in hundreds of species, perhaps thousands. The behavior varies in frequency between major animal groups -- nonexistent in some, common in others. It varies from species to species and even within the same species, depending on local environmental conditions. As important, the behavior serves a variety of functions, depending on the cannibal, and some of these have nothing to do with stress or captive conditions. There are even instances in which an individual being cannibalized receives a benefit. Before his death in a boating accident in 2000, Gary Polis, an ecologist at the University of California, Davis, came up with a list of cannibalism-related rules for invertebrates. Immature animals are consumed more often than adults, he found, and many species do not recognize individuals of their own kind (especially eggs and immature stages) as anything other than food. He noted that cannibalism was more common in females than in males, and that as alternative forms of nutrition decrease in availability, incidents of cannibalism will increase. Lastly, in a given population, cannibalism is often directly related to the degree of overcrowding.

That price, though, can be substantial. Cannibals that consume their own relatives remove those genes from the population, reducing what scientists call their inclusive fitness. But the most significant drawback appears to be a greater chance of acquiring harmful, species-specific parasites or pathogens. In the most famous example, the Fore people of New Guinea were nearly driven to extinction as a result of their ritualized consumption of brains and other tissues cut from the bodies of deceased kin. Many had died of kuru, a neurodegenerative condition similar to mad cow disease, and their tissues contained the pathogen, spreading it even further. As a new generation of researchers builds upon the work of scientists like Dr. Polis and Laurel Fox, an evolutionary biologist at the University of California, Santa Cruz, cannibalism in nature has begun to seem almost normal. We now know that a significant amount of cannibalism occurs in mollusks, insects and arachnids. Additionally, thousands of aquatic invertebrates like clams and corals have tiny eggs and larvae that are often a major food source for the filter-feeding adults -- itself a form of indiscriminate cannibalism. In many fish species, adults can be a million times as large as their own eggs. Fish eggs, larvae and fry are vast in number, minute in size and high in nutritional value. This makes them a nonthreatening and easily collected food source. It is also why ichthyologists consider the absence of cannibalism in fishes, rather than its presence, to be the exceptional case.

But the black lace-weaver spider (Amaurobius ferox) takes the concept of prepackaged meals a step further. One day after spiderlings hatch, new mothers lay a clutch of trophic eggs, which are doled out to their hungry babies. This keeps them satisfied for the next three days, after which the spiderlings are ready for their next stage of development. After their first molt, black lace-weaver spiderlings are too large for their mother to care for, though they are in dire need of additional food. In a sacrificial act of parenting, she calls the babies to her by drumming on the web and presses her body down into the gathering crowd. The ravenous spiderlings swarm over their mother's body. Then they eat her alive. In sand tiger sharks (Carcharias taurus), the babies doing the cannibalizing are not even born yet. The young of sand tigers, like hammerheads (Sphyrna zygaena) and blue sharks (Prionace glauca), develop inside the females' oviducts, a developmental strategy known as histotrophic viviparity. Scientists who first looked at late-term sand tiger embryos in 1948 noticed that these specimens were anatomically well developed, with mouths full of sharp teeth -- a point (or several) driven home when one researcher was bitten on the hand while probing the oviduct of a pregnant specimen.

Strangely, these late-term embryos also had swollen bellies, which were initially thought to be yolk sacs, a form of stored food. This was puzzling, since most of the nutrient-rich yolk should have been used up by this late stage of development. Further investigation showed that the abdominal bumps were not yolk sacs at all -- they were stomachs full of smaller fetal sharks. These embryos had fallen victim to the ultimate in sibling rivalry, a form of in utero cannibalism known as adelphophagy (from the ancient Greek for ""brother eating"") -- sibling cannibalism. Such behavior is possible because sand tiger shark oviducts contain embryos at different developmental stages (a characteristic that also evolved in birds). Once the largest of the embryos run through their own yolk supply, they begin consuming eggs.

And when the eggs are gone, the ravenous fetal sharks begin consuming their smaller siblings. Ultimately, only two pups remain, one in each oviduct. This is similar to the ""lifeboat strategy"" seen in birds like vultures and egrets. Here cannibalism is often the end result of asynchronous hatching: two eggs are laid, but one hatches several days before the other. The firstborn chick uses its extra bulk to win squabbles over food with its younger brother or sister. In instances where the parents are unable to provide enough to eat, the firstborn will kill and consume the younger sibling. During times of stress, this is an efficient way to produce well-nourished offspring -- albeit fewer of them.

Examples of animal cannibalism are as numerous as they are interesting, from spadefoot toad larvae who eat their own brood-mates to legless amphibians called caecilians whose hatchlings peel and consume their mothers' skin. And they occur among mammals, too. Polar bears consume other polar bears, and were doing so long before climate change impacted their hunting practices. And male lions, after taking over a pride, will eat the cubs that another male has sired. Both are examples of heterocannibalism -- the eating of nonrelatives. In lions, incoming males seek to terminate the maternal investment in unrelated cubs. More important, a lioness with cubs will not come into heat for a year and a half after giving birth. But, as has been observed in other mammals, like bears, a lioness that loses her cubs becomes sexually receptive almost immediately. It Isn't Just for Animals Are there instances where, as in the animal kingdom, human cannibalism makes sense? And if so, could this behavior resurface in the future? Cannibalism may be gruesome, and repugnant to our current sensibilities, but it has been widely practiced for a variety of reasons. Funerary cannibalism was practiced by groups like the Fore of New Guinea and the Wari' of Brazil. These indigenous people were as mortified at the concept of burying their dead as newly arrived missionaries and anthropologists were at the thought of consuming their own departed loved ones.

Throughout their long history, body parts were such important ingredients in Chinese culinary cannibalism that the historian and author Key Ray Chong devoted a 13-page chapter in his book ""Cannibalism in China"" to ""Methods of Cooking Human Flesh."" Rather than an emergency ration consumed as a last resort, there are many reports that exotic human-based dishes were prepared for Chinese royalty and upper-class citizens. Human cannibalism has also been an instrument of terror. The practice was used to instill horror and intense fear in dissenters during China's Cultural Revolution, and Japanese soldiers cannibalized prisoners of war during World War II (a fate that President George H. W. Bush barely escaped after his plane was shot down). While filial piety is a highly regarded Confucian virtue, it was also the basis for an extreme act of cannibalism-related self-sacrifice. According to Chong, from ancient China through the 19th century, relatives provided parts of their own bodies (thigh and upper arm were the most commonly used) for the consumption and medical benefit of their elders. Then there are the more familiar stories, the tales of human cannibalism that springs from hunger. Throughout history and across multiple cultures, when people faced extremely stressful conditions like sieges, famines and strandings (the snowbound Donner Party), many eventually consumed their dead -- even their own relatives. In a procedure that had become known to seafarers as ""the custom of the sea,"" sailors cast adrift on the open ocean drew straws. The sailor who drew the short straw gave up his life so that rest might eat. In perhaps the most famous case, in 1765 a storm dismasted the American sloop Peggy, leaving it adrift in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean with its captain, nine crewmen and a single slave. After consuming the ship's cat, their uniform buttons and a leather bilge pump, and after the captain had retreated to his cabin clutching a pistol, the crew decided to draw lots. The loser was to be served up as dinner. By an incredible coincidence, the slave drew the short straw. Although the man begged for his life, the captain was unable to prevent his murder, later writing that as the crew prepared to cook the body, one sailor rushed in, tore away the slave's liver and ate it raw. This is the horrific origin of the term ""lifeboat strategy,"" co-opted by ornithologists over two centuries later to describe the fate of unfortunate nestlings.

As scientists have come to understand, factors like overpopulation and a lack of alternative forms of nutrition lead to cannibalism among animals, and it is clear that even modern humans have been driven to the behavior on many occasions. What, then, of the future? Populations are growing. Resources are dwindling. Deserts are spreading. And the societal rules that bind us together are proving more fragile than we ever imagined they could be. Maybe it is wise to remember that human cannibalism, so unthinkable now, was not uncommon not so long ago.","Once thought to be aberrant behavior, cannibalism is common in the natural world — and for many species, not necessarily a bad thing.",ffd6f4bf-afcb-5cf1-831d-2cf57ce40219,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/31/science/31Cannibal/31Cannibal-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=76a8184eb698950deb8e1dcaf53386e351e0861d60b0254fbfd0936dda701075&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A Komodo dragon in Indonesia eating the carcass of another dragon.,ffd6f4bf-afcb-5cf1-831d-2cf57ce40219,N24News/imgs/ffd6f4bf-afcb-5cf1-831d-2cf57ce40219.jpg,2
Dance,Five Dancers Accuse City Ballet's Peter Martins of Physical Abuse,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/arts/dance/peter-martins-ballet-new-york-city-physical-abuse.html,"In 1993, Jeffrey Edwards was a soloist with New York City Ballet when he did something radical, at least for the company: He accused Peter Martins, the powerful ballet master in chief, of verbal and physical abuse, and reported him. ""I brought a complaint to the general manager, company manager and the dancers' union, describing Peter's conduct in detail,"" Mr. Edwards said in a recent statement to The New York Times. The union, the American Guild of Musical Artists, confirmed that it had received the complaint. But to all appearances, nothing much happened. Mr. Martins continued in his role as leader of City Ballet and the School of American Ballet, and Mr. Edwards left the company shortly thereafter. The next year, Victor Ostrovsky, a 12-year-old student at the ballet school, had his own run-in with Mr. Martins. During a dress rehearsal, Mr. Ostrovsky said he was horsing around onstage with other children when Mr. Martins became enraged and grabbed him by the back of the neck in what Mr. Ostrovsky called ""a death lock.""

""He's yanking me around to the left and to the right, he's digging his left thumb and his middle finger -- I felt like he was piercing my muscle,"" Mr. Ostrovsky said in a telephone interview. ""I started crying and sobbing profusely."" He dropped out of the school. ""I was depressed; I was embarrassed,"" he said. ""He assaulted me onstage in front of the whole cast."" Mr. Edwards and Mr. Ostrovsky are two of five City Ballet dancers -- one of whom still works with the company -- who in recent interviews accused Mr. Martins of threatening or physically abusing them and others in the company. Their descriptions of his behavior -- from raising his fist to physical altercations -- could be another problem for Mr. Martins, who has taken a leave as the leader of City Ballet and the School of American Ballet while they investigate a sexual harassment claim against him. Mr. Martins has long been known to have intimate relationships with dancers, as well as a quick, volcanic temper. That he was able to act so freely, his critics say, points to dysfunctional power relationships between Mr. Martins and his employees, and between him and City Ballet's management, which at times seems to have looked the other way. After incidents with Mr. Edwards and another dancer, Kelly Boal -- who recently described her encounter to The Washington Post -- some dancers suggested adding an ""abuse clause"" to their contract. Lindsay Fischer, a former City Ballet dancer who was head of the union committee at the time, said the clause -- which had originally been proposed in response to a racist incident at the Houston Ballet -- was ultimately voted down. ""In the end, we left the contract the way it was,"" said Mr. Fischer, now principal balletmaster, at the National Ballet of Canada. ""Our opinion was we were already protected by ordinary law, not to mention human decency.""

Stephen E. Tisman, a lawyer for Mr. Martins, said: ""While the investigation is going on, Peter is not going to be commenting publicly on allegations."" City Ballet and the school also said they were unable to comment, citing the investigation. Mr. Martins is an outsize figure in the dance world, controlling virtually every aspect of City Ballet -- from choreography to casting -- and making it nearly impossible for dancers to speak up without professional consequences. Alina Dronova, a dancer in the corps de ballet for 17 years, said Mr. Martins was routinely allowed to be aggressive. ""He would grab me by my neck and kick me out of his office,"" she said. ""He would do that to almost everyone."" For dancers to succeed, it sometimes seemed as if physical intimidation had to be endured. ""I have the visual of him standing over me with a fist clenched two weeks before he promoted me,"" said a current member of the company who asking for anonymity out of fear of repercussions. John Clifford, a principal dancer and choreographer under George Balanchine, recalled teaching a City Ballet class in 1987 when Mr. Martins grew angry with him. ""He slammed his fists into the wall about an inch from my head,"" Mr. Clifford said. ""It was a violent, intimidating act, and it scared me. ""He just blew up,"" Mr. Clifford continued, adding that Mr. Martins never asked him back. Mr. Clifford is also one of two former dancers who said they witnessed Mr. Martins get violent with Heather Watts, a former principal dancer with the company who had a yearslong stormy romantic relationship with Mr. Martins.

""I saw him pick her up and slam her into a cement wall,"" Mr. Clifford recalled. ""I was outside his dressing room."" (Ms. Watts declined to comment.) ""I want to make sure these girls who are reporting this are taken seriously,"" added Mr. Clifford, the founding artistic director of Los Angeles Dance Theater. ""It's not gossip, it's fact. It's something I saw with my own eyes."" In 1992, Mr. Martins was charged with third-degree assault against his wife, Darci Kistler, then a principal in the company. Ms. Kistler told the police that her arms and legs had been cut and bruised. The misdemeanor charge was later dropped. Several of the interviewed dancers expressed surprise that City Ballet had kept Mr. Martins on after that incident. Over the weekend, City Ballet appointed an interim team of City Ballet dancers to lead the company during Mr. Martins's absence, the duration of which has not been specified. The team was introduced to the company at a Saturday meeting of City Ballet's dancers, Katherine Brown the executive director, and two trustees: Charles W. Scharf, the chairman, and Robert I. Lipp, the vice chairman. At the meeting, Mr. Lipp expressed hope that Mr. Martins could soon ""be back and continuing in his regular role."" ""I know it's not business as usual,"" he added. ""We're going to do the right thing, whatever that turns out to be.""","The accusations, spanning decades, come after a sexual harassment claim against Mr. Martins.",2b5f5d92-37fd-5faa-a99d-1326991089f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/02/arts/danceJMP/dance-inquiry1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c471b13d32666fd0b15119fef3cb06f1688b39676be41bbcc949cfe69188cb5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Peter Martins with dancers from the New York City Ballet.,2b5f5d92-37fd-5faa-a99d-1326991089f3,N24News/imgs/2b5f5d92-37fd-5faa-a99d-1326991089f3.jpg,6
Fashion & Style,Why You Should Love Secondhand Fashion Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/13/fashion/the-realreal-consignment-store.html,"The following is a real story about the RealReal, a luxury consignment start-up that now has a brick-and-mortar store in SoHo. A few months ago, a friend walked into an intimate gathering wearing a daisy print Celine skirt. One of our mutual friends said to her, ""I saw that on the RealReal."" Another said, ""Oh, I'm so happy you were the one who got it."" This is perhaps how billionaires chat after a Sotheby's auction, which is not the camaraderie and pride one would expect to hear about secondhand shopping. The huge success (the RealReal has raised $173 million since its founding) of various consignment sites feels opposed to the foundering retail business. There is Grailed, which focuses on street wear, and Heroine, a women's wear counterpart, along with Vestiaire Collective and 1stdibs. They have consumed the middle market, taking customers for whom actual luxury pricing is too real ... real. Shopping consignment is also a beautiful distraction. It is fashion Candy Crush; finding and scoring certain pieces can feel like a personal victory. Women I know who are familiar with the RealReal said they've started looking at it daily; the rest of the world is just too real ... real.

All items on display in the store are simultaneously available to shop online. Sales associates can scan items for customers in person, temporarily removing them from the site while they're being considered on the floor. Even while shopping in the store, there is the same it-could-disappear-at-any-moment feeling you get online. In the store which was designed by Courtney Applebaum, the interior designer for the Row (a label represented on almost every rack), you can wait on gorgeous textural couches while your pieces are appraised. There is a flower stall at the front where you can buy stems by Fox Fodder Farm, a coffee bar downstairs and weekly events and workshops, like Faux Fridays, which instruct attendees on how to spot fake Louis Vuitton, Chanel and designer sneakers. In the middle of the floor is a collaborator-curated space, and this month the selection was chosen by Vanessa Traina and Allee Goldstein of the Line. Nearby, one can slide racks of clothing out from a large console of hidden cabinets. They swoosh out deliciously, packed with treasures. A friend described the sensation of unveiling these clothes as incredibly erotic. Upon entering, the first two things I checked out were the same price: a Frank Stella copper lithograph and a Balenciaga leather jacket with a shearling collar ($2,500). A saleswoman approached and struck up a conversation that bopped its way to the question ""So what do you do with your art history degree?""

Lady Bird replies, ""It's perfect."" The two shift instantly to loving, fawning friends. It's delightful. My youthful experiences in thrift stores with my mother followed the opposite emotional structure. We would have some of our nicest conversations among the racks, until I found something I wanted; then the (low stakes) conflict would begin, almost always over the size of a garment I was holding. My mother would see a women's 3X or girls 14 tag and, probably exhausted because I was known to idle in the store's fluorescent-lit dust for up to five hours a weekend, protest. ""That's not your size,"" she would say. I would argue, ""Size doesn't exist in this space!"" And I still believe that to thrift or shop consignment, a little of this philosophy is required.

A size 8 on one tag in the RealReal may be the same measurements as a size zero on another. At the store, clothes are arranged on Extra-Small/Small racks and Medium/Large racks. But really, the size of the clothes depends on how you want them to fit, and it's a game of eyeing and trying. Unlike the website, clothes here are arranged only by size, not by type or color or designer (apart from one Gucci rack, where there was a leather bag for $2,850 with ""REAL"" painted in yellow above the logo). Size is abstract to me even in a store with a single brand, but a friend I was with said she didn't like her position in the space to be about her size. Fair enough. On the other hand, it's possible to encounter a lot of things you wouldn't click on on the site. Online, the pieces are photographed beautifully, masking (not in a deceptive way) wear in the fabric. When you can hold them, it's a different experience. A Chanel tweed blazer with a loose button is $1,295. There were little threads, fabric that's not worn out but was definitely sighing, and tiny snags on many items. Wool Proenza pants ($225), a cotton Tome dress ($295) and a suede Acne skirt ($245) are all worth it if one longed for them on the runway. Many pieces seem to be under $300, or else above $1,200. I found a few exceptions, but when you see $1,395 consistently, a sudden $295 feels like a precious mistake to be grabbed immediately. In other consignment shops in the city, I let my mind wonder if the clothes belong to someone recently deceased. Here it's possible to mostly dissociate from their former lives and think only about the future.

Food,"At Puerta del Sol, Beef and Potatoes Take Cues From Bolivia",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/09/dining/puerta-del-sol-review.html,"Beef heart is a mighty muscle, built to power nearly a ton's worth of animal. But at Puerta del Sol in Woodside, Queens, it's all melt, coaxed by smoke and repeatedly brushed with olive oil and its own slow juices on the grill. As in the high, thin-aired Andean city of La Paz, Bolivia, where the owner, Jose Sanchez, grew up, hearts are cut down to mouthfuls and strung on skewers that arrive with burned tips. They're served with a sturdy potato and the mandated sauce: peanuts toasted with salt and ground to butter, then simmered with aji amarillo, an indigenous chile that ranks in heat alongside Tabasco and cayenne. What registers is less fire than sun-soaked ripeness.

Around 4,300 people of Bolivian descent live in New York City, according to Census Bureau estimates, with more than half settled in Queens. Only a few restaurants in the city have ever specialized in the landlocked nation's cuisine, and several -- Pena Grill, Raices, Cumbre, Renacer, Vergel Casa de Campo -- have cycled through this Woodside address.

Mr. Sanchez, who came to the United States in 1985 at the age of 18, has owned a Colombian restaurant, Los Arrieros in Jackson Heights, for more than two decades. (Colombians outnumber Bolivians in the city by more than 20 to one.) In October, he took over this Woodside storefront and renamed it Puerta del Sol, after the ancient megalithic gate in the Tiwanaku ruins outside La Paz, carved out of one great slab of andesite. Magda Riveros, the chef, makes food that is unfussy and dangerously ample. A broad flat steak comes with a drape of Colombian white cheese almost equal to it in dimensions, along with giant fava beans, wrinkly skinned and chewy, and a cob of mote (hominy), its dense kernels the size of back molars and steadfastly unsweet. A meal may begin with saltenas, which look like grand empanadas, fat and upright, with a thick, nubbly braid on top. But their insides reveal an affinity to Chinese xiao long bao: The dough, tinged with sugar and gilded by egg wash, is wrapped around ice-cream scoops of chilled jigote -- a soup-stew of coarsely chopped top round or chicken, loaded with olives, raisins and potatoes -- which, as the saltena bakes, starts to seethe. For charquekan, beef is hung to dry for three days, then boiled and struck with a mallet until it frays. Crisped in a pan, the strands emerge as a kind of ossified tumbleweed of meat, shattering and salty. It's surrounded by triangles of creamy Colombian white cheese, a pale shoulder of potato and two hard-boiled eggs, waiting to be peeled.

Bolivia and its neighbor Peru were the birthplace of the potato, which may explain its omnipresence here, tucked alongside trucha (fried trout, harking back to its cousins in Lake Titicaca) and huddled under a stew of beef tongue and aji rojo, a mild chile with an intimation of smoked blueberry jam. French fries are half-sunk in sopa de mani, a soup of beef broth and pulverized peanuts; somehow the fries soak up the broth without wholly losing structure, and are a delight. It's worth ordering a side of chuno, potatoes left to bask in the Andean sun by day and freeze by night, over and over until they turn black and hard and can last forever. They're boiled until just slightly relaxed and taste of earth and tracts of time.","A meal punctuated with potatoes in various forms may begin with tender, skewered beef hearts at this small, welcoming spot in Woodside, Queens.",c2aca71e-daff-5f90-b6ed-f7942f062ec9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/15/dining/09hungry1/merlin_154312050_c7115f84-321b-45f5-9219-9c61263e7e62-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a29b477c0ae7b211954428c9ae8e0db4316a58371ae00bcc92abcd5c2faffc6d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The food at Puerta del Sol is unfussy and dangerously ample, with potatoes represented in almost every dish.",c2aca71e-daff-5f90-b6ed-f7942f062ec9,N24News/imgs/c2aca71e-daff-5f90-b6ed-f7942f062ec9.jpg,17
Music,Why Obsessive K-Pop Fans Are Turning Toward Political Activism,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/arts/music/k-pop-fans-trump-politics.html,"In certain corners of the internet, the organizing prowess of K-pop fans -- the typically young and diverse international enthusiasts of Korean pop music who congregate daily on social media -- has long been the stuff of legend: Through coordinated group action, so-called fan armies of acts like BTS and Blackpink make sure that their favorite idols are trending topics who lead the music charts and sell out stadiums from South Korea to the Rose Bowl in Los Angeles and Citi Field in New York. Now, amid a pandemic, a forthcoming presidential election and inescapable conversations about race, this loose collective of digital warriors is trying to exert its influence in a new realm: the American political arena. Spurred at first by the ongoing Black Lives Matter protests around the world, K-pop stans made themselves known outside of music circles this weekend, when some took credit for helping to inflate expectations for President Trump's rally in Oklahoma by reserving tickets they had no plans to use. But while the Trump campaign has denied that the pointed prank affected rally attendance, blaming protesters and the news media instead, the call to action in K-pop circles revealed a growing realization that fans' efficient social-media tactics for fund-raising or making a song go viral can also be used for political activism.

""The English-speaking K-pop fans who are getting involved in this, who are up on these issues, these are not foreigners,"" said CedarBough Saeji, an academic who studies K-pop fan culture. ""These are Americans."" ""That these young, socially progressive, outward-looking people who are really adept at using these online platforms -- who are stuck at home and online even more because of Covid-19 -- that these people are doing political things is not surprising,"" added Ms. Saeji, a visiting assistant professor of East Asian culture at Indiana University Bloomington. ""These are young people who are completely willing to learn about a new culture to follow their interest in some pop-culture product. These are exactly the kind of people who are the opposite of the Trump audience that claps when he disses 'Parasite' and says that 'Gone With the Wind' is a real movie."" In the days since Mr. Trump's rally in Tulsa, no evidence has emerged that South Korean fans of K-pop were involved in any significant way in the ""no-show"" campaign. South Korean news media instead relayed American reports from Tulsa, treating the episode mainly as a gag by teenage fans of K-pop and TikTok users in the United States. South Koreans tend to follow U.S. elections closely because they could affect alliance relations between Washington and Seoul, and American policy on North Korea. But they generally remain wary of taking sides in U.S. politics. Mr. Trump has been quite popular among liberal South Koreans, including young people, by raising hopes that his diplomacy with North Korea's leader, Kim Jong-un, might produce a breakthrough in long-stalled talks on ending the North's nuclear threat and establishing peace on the Korean Peninsula.

On Monday, some South Koreans responded to the news from Tulsa by expressing concern about how Mr. Trump might react. ""Why does K-pop meddle in an American political dispute,"" wrote one reader of a local newspaper article about the rally. But while K-pop culture in South Korea is a largely apolitical mainstream concern, leaving fan armies to focus on boosting album sales and propping up their idols, the community's position as a subculture in the United States may lend itself to more radical gestures, especially at a time of increased political polarization.

""Although K-pop's message is not necessarily political in an overt sense, they are often about empowerment and self-confidence,"" said the author of the ""Ask a Korean!"" blog, who uses the pen name T.K. Park. ""Lots of first-time K-pop fans, for example, got into BTS because the group's message of 'love yourself' strongly resonated with them."" And since such content has attracted an audience made up largely of women and people of color, Mr. Park added, ""this message pushes them to be more expressive with every aspect of their lives, including politics."" They had also already honed the necessary skills. ""K-pop fans learned how to organize through their fandom,"" Mr. Park said. ""K-pop is a digital-native music,"" he added, and South Korea's early adoption of nationwide broadband service ""made Korean pop music respond to the demands of the internet, and also made K-pop's fandom the most sophisticated actors in the digital sphere."" He pointed to the near-constant campaigns to flood radio stations with song requests or sell out concert tickets in a matter of minutes as a training ground: ""All of these activities can be translated into politics very easily."" Nicole Santero, a fan and Ph.D. student with a focus on the BTS Army who also runs the data-focused @ResearchBTS account, found that in May, there were only two days when a term related to the group was not trending worldwide on Twitter.

""Sometimes they don't even mean to trend, but there's so many of them that sometimes they accidentally trend random words,"" she said. ""They're really, really passionate people who just fight for what they love. Those characteristics translate well when you look at social issues."" A spokeswoman for Twitter said that K-pop was the most tweeted about music genre worldwide, with more than 6.1 billion tweets in 2019, an increase of 15 percent from the year before. BTS was the most tweeted about artist for the last three years, the company added. TikTok and Facebook declined to provide data. The recent turn toward political activism in the United States also follows a concerted effort by K-pop fans in recent years to make positive change en masse, in part as a reaction to the groups' reputations as superficial, silly and even menacing mobs. Like the most fervent fan bases of American pop stars -- including Justin Bieber's Beliebers, Beyonce's BeyHive or Nicki Minaj's Barbz, known collectively as ""stans"" after the Eminem song about an obsessive stalker -- K-pop followers have been accused of harassment for piling onto critics or rivals. In South Korea, they have also been viewed as overly fawning, and even cultlike, banding together, for instance, to buy presents like luxury watches for famous singers. But these days, philanthropic donations to uncontroversial causes like the poor, the old or the terminally ill -- often in made in the name of chosen artists -- are more common. ""This was a way to remake fandom in the eyes of the public,"" Ms. Saeji said.","After claiming some credit for the fizzling of President Trump's rally in Oklahoma, the online armies of Korean pop music listeners are feeling prepared and empowered.",9715983b-2390-528e-8023-64f8f3278b0d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/22/arts/22kpop2/22kpop2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7956bdb6d1aa23a449b4ccaf1239c6a237efccf97eaa3851605b9b1fb984f8ee&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A crowd of K-pop fans at the annual KCON convention in Newark in 2015.

Dance,"Dazzling a Prince, Slowly, Gently, on Point",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/08/arts/dance/cinderella-to-join-american-ballet-theater-repertory.html,"Your world is not the only world: That's the lesson of Romantic ballet. And when a grown woman moves from one world to another, she herself is transformed. In Prokofiev's ""Cinderella,"" not only does the title character's dream come true, but she becomes her dream version of herself. Though there have been multiple stagings of this 1945 three-act score, the only one to stand the test of time has been Frederick Ashton's ""Cinderella"" (1948), which enters the repertory of American Ballet Theater on Monday at the Metropolitan Opera House. It's a ballet of which I hate to miss a performance. I scarcely care about changes of cast; I just love getting to know the choreography better. Whenever anybody else is in the kitchen, Cinderella is just a supporting character on the sidelines. Center stage belongs to her grotesque Stepsisters (who, in the British tradition of Christmas pantomime dames, are played by men). She dances on point and with natural grace -- but at this stage, she's just a Second Hand Rose. Alone, she dances the step she just saw the Dancing Master teach her sisters: First she parodies them, then she shows how it should go to perfection. Next she waltzes -- with her broom, which is, she thinks, her only prince for the evening. Yet, in the ballroom, she's at once the work's prima ballerina, to a thrilling but baffling degree. From the moment of her first appearance at the top of the staircase, nobody questions her supremacy.

During Ashton's lifetime, the ugly sisters were often the ballet's highlight. Ashton himself and Robert Helpmann, wonderfully naughty clowns, long gave classic performances of the roles. But this work has been rehearsed with little humor since their deaths, so that at the Royal Ballet in Covent Garden, their roles are often now just camp checklists of stale gags, without connective wit. Never mind: This only serves to better reveal this ballet's true nature. The greatest strokes of ""Cinderella"" have nothing to do with comedy. Its heart is in its steps, and they tell a story with layers beyond any in the printed program. Cinderella begins to discover ballet's transcendent side when, in the second half of Act I, her Fairy Godmother turns the kitchen into a space for magic. The seasons of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter dance solos for her -- each complex, tight-packed, and intricate. Prokofiev's music for them is very far from sugarcoated: Spring and Autumn sound violent, abrupt, and there is no white-Christmas charm to Winter.

Ashton gives each her own character. Spring's jumps, with feet tucked together, were based on the idea of ""bursting of buds""; Summer has alternating imagery of languor, stillness and spinning speed; Autumn has off-balance pirouettes that suggest sudden whirlwinds; and Winter, in one diagonal, seems, with her circling feet, to spread films of ice on the floor. Then the Fairy Godmother leads all four dancers in a quick recap, with all four quoting particular steps. As we realize we're watching a theme-and-variations construction, we get a clue of what's to follow. Next comes the corps de ballet of 12 Stars. The waltz that Prokofiev gives them is one of his most irresistible melodies; Ashton responds to it in brilliant geometries but also with a strikingly percussive emphasis. It's famous that his favorite two words in rehearsal were ""bend"" and ""more""; these corps dancers bend from the waist -- forward, backward, sideways -- as they mark out the music's dark pulse. Four Seasons, 12 Stars: These will be Cinderella's retinue when she goes to the ball, but they are spirits of time, and their dances keep making us alternately conscious and heedless of the clock. The Act II ballroom is pervaded by this double-edged sense of time. Often, a staccato delivery of steps helps to make us feel that this is no ordinary ballroom; it's dense, charged. Indeed, it's surreal. The Jester and the Prince's four male companions start to quote steps from the Seasons variations (those tucked-up feet-together jumps, for instance), as if they belonged to the same magical realm as those spirits they've never yet met.

And at times, it becomes a chamber of mirrors, with dancers presenting choreography with their backs to us. The most enchanting example of this occurs in Cinderella's solo. As the music of her opening phrases returns -- its soft 4/4 meter suggests the quarter-hour chimes of a clock -- she dances up the centerline of the stage, with her back to us. In one mini-phrase, while poised on point, she bends backward from the waist, looking calmly over her shoulder: The meter takes her from upright to arching back and then upright again on Beats 2, 3, 4 of the bar, all while poised on the same one point. Despite the dance's strong pulse, the image suggests that she's beyond both time and gravity. Even when alone with the Prince, she stays remote. In their pas de deux, he no sooner lifts her than her legs beat a frisson of response. Later partnering sequences take her to greater heights of rapture. Here's that tucked-up feet-together jump again -- but, when done as a lift, it changes out of recognition.

This is one of the great ballet love scenes, and yet hero and heroine remain mysteries to each other, seldom looking at each other's faces. As their dance comes to a close, she spins around him in one circle of turns and then another. (The sequence seems based on Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the great ""Never Gonna Dance"" duet of ""Swing Time."") She's his, but she's not; they're together but apart. Then, at midnight, dream switches into nightmare. Courtiers, Jester, Stars, Seasons all turn into an implacable machine, hemming her in. Ashton gives one astounding step to the four Seasons here: In unison, partnered by the Prince's four friends, they do single fouette turns, but the killer moment comes as they implacably lower their working legs (while the music grinds out time at its cruelest). Those feet descend like a portcullis, or like simultaneous guillotines. Cinderella seems to have been in Wonderland and through the Looking Glass; she's the only real person onstage, and now she flees. Back in the kitchen in Act III, Cinderella is Second Hand Rose again, all quotations; but now it's her ballroom self she's quoting. Those steps, that magic: What was real? When the Prince reclaims her, she again enters a world of transcendence. Now, however, time exerts no pressure. In a supported adagio that Ashton added in the early 1960s, the largo phrase that she dances with the Prince is a variation on the step she once imitated from the Dancing Master and her Stepsisters. But now, it's slow, grand, serene (they look each other in the face in one sequence); and the Seasons and Stars amplify it chorally. Here, at last, these lovers have world enough, and time.","Frederick Ashton's ""Cinderella,"" which enters the repertory of American Ballet Theater on Monday at the Metropolitan Opera House, is the only staging of Prokofiev's score to stand the test of time.",339d67c0-04af-5a94-a9f4-fe6226e48b4f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/08/arts/08CINDERELLA1/08CINDERELLA1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=276&w=600&s=360efc51724675965d5ae8ff9b15adf283220502ac02ddc76a4fbf55bd9d9b04&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Jeffrey Cirio and Misa Kuranaga, center, in Boston Ballet's March staging of ""Cinderella.""",339d67c0-04af-5a94-a9f4-fe6226e48b4f,N24News/imgs/339d67c0-04af-5a94-a9f4-fe6226e48b4f.jpg,6
Real Estate,Upper Manhattan Nest for a Mother and Son,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/28/realestate/upper-manhattan-nest-for-a-mother-and-son.html,"The Greenwich Village apartment where Laura Martin lived with her son, Dax Roy, couldn't have been more convenient. It was across Sixth Avenue from his elementary school. On school mornings, Ms. Martin would walk Dax across the street and then return home. The rent on their 1,100-square-foot two-bedroom was around $6,000 a month. Neighbors who moved into the building more recently ""who had the same apartment were paying like $8,000 or something,"" said Ms. Martin, an inventor and product designer in her 40s, who, having endured tiny kitchens, invented a magnetic spice rack. Her goal was to purchase a similar space for a lower monthly outlay. ""At first I objected to moving because I liked my old home and, you know, there's no place like home,"" said Dax, an actor who is now 11. But he was finishing elementary school and would be entering middle school in a different part of town, so it was a good time for a change.

The Audubon Park Historic District, which includes part of Riverside Drive in the West 150s, beckoned. A friend had moved there four years ago. And ""Tio Papi,"" a movie in which Dax played the youngest of six children, had been filmed there three years ago. The buildings were grand and handsome, in a neighborhood with a kind of bohemian vibe. ""That's what the Village used to be,"" Ms. Martin said. She went there to visit the six-story Crillon Court, built in the mid-1920s and recently restored. Two-bedroom condominium units were priced in the $600,000s, which seemed high. ""I preferred something before it is renovated so I could do it,"" said Ms. Martin, a graduate of Parsons the New School for Design.

Beth Gittleman, an agent there, showed her a renovated apartment in an eight-unit condo for $555,000 on low-rise Edgecombe Avenue, which is southeast of Audubon Park. Monthly charges were in the mid-$500s. It was a ""nicely done but out-of-a-catalog kind of thing,"" Ms. Martin said. ""She wasn't into the area,"" Ms. Gittleman said. ""She had her heart set on Riverside Drive."" So they headed north to a six-story condominium conversion on Riverside Drive in Hamilton Heights in the high West 140s. A two-bedroom there was $595,000, with monthly charges of around $800. The views were of brick walls. ""It wasn't quite there. I knew we could do better,"" Ms. Martin said.

Ms. Gittleman persuaded her to visit co-op buildings, not just condos. ""You are going to get more space for your price,"" Ms. Gittleman said. ""Co-ops up here are different from downtown. There is a little more leniency."" At a grand 1911 doorman co-op building back in the Audubon Park Historic District, Ms. Martin saw a two-bedroom with around 950 square feet. The asking price was $479,000, with maintenance of around $1,200 a month. The building had a liberal sublet policy, potentially advantageous if Dax needed to move temporarily for an acting job. The apartment had original details and a renovated kitchen. The view ""looks like West Side Story, all the fire escapes,"" Ms. Martin said. She knew she had found their new home. ""There was other interest,"" Ms. Gittleman said. Wanting to minimize chances of being outbid, Ms. Martin offered $484,000, and was accepted. She, Dax and Red arrived earlier in the summer.

Dax has the master bedroom. The bedrooms are at opposite ends of the apartment, ""so I sort of get my own side of the house,"" he said. ""In my old apartment, we had a huge living room but my room was tiny, and now I have a big room but the living room is medium-sized. I get to keep a lot more stuff in my room and I won't be crammed."" Ms. Martin, whose home is often filled with guests, said she is not used to living with only one bathroom. She is decorating around the crooked floors and bulky radiators. Cell reception inside is not ideal. Nor is the apartment's combination washer-dryer. ""I am ready to throw it out the window,"" Ms. Martin said. ""I put some clothes in there and they came out smelly and hard."" Instead she uses the building's ""nice big laundry room with industrial-size washers and dryers, and there's something to be said for four loads at once."" She and her son love their new neighborhood, filled with Dominican restaurants and dotted with intriguing offerings, like the 18-month-old Taszo Espresso Bar for the area's emerging cappuccino-drinking demographic. The family's living expenses have plunged: Housing costs are less than half of what they were. In her new neighborhood, dry-cleaning and pressing a pleated skirt costs just $4.50. ""I almost fell over,"" Ms. Martin said. She accompanies Dax downtown to school and back by subway and bus. ""I like doing it,"" she said. In the past, other parents ""would walk their kids to school and have these conversations, but we lived across the street. Now we get to have conversations and talk about stuff, and it's actually my favorite time of the day.""","Laura Martin and her son, Dax Roy, sought to buy an apartment in Audubon Park.",686151ca-d5b7-5c86-afb8-958193ea44a0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/28/realestate/28HUNT-MAIN/28HUNT-MAIN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=f6b78659a11b09395817adfb640493b628dec76088f55c5995ade60e18778459&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"THE BUYER Laura Martin at home with her son, Dax Roy, and Red in the Audubon Park Historic District.",686151ca-d5b7-5c86-afb8-958193ea44a0,N24News/imgs/686151ca-d5b7-5c86-afb8-958193ea44a0.jpg,7
Health,"Patient, Can You Spare a Dime?",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/health/hospitals-donations-patients.html,"Should your doctor ask you to make a donation to help the medical center where you were treated? If you are a generous donor, should you be rewarded with a better room -- or your doctor's cellphone number? Medical centers across the United States are asking patients, especially wealthy ones, to donate money, in addition to whatever they pay for actual care. The money is needed, the providers say, to defray costs or provide charity care. Despite rigid privacy rules regarding medical records, hospital fund-raising offices are allowed to look at patient's finances to see if he or she might be wealthy enough to make a significant donation. Ethical guidelines from professional societies say these practices are acceptable. Until now, no one has asked patients themselves what they think about these increasingly common tactics. A new national survey, published on Tuesday in JAMA, finds that most patients are repelled by these solicitations.

""This is the first study, to my knowledge, reporting what members of the lay public think,"" said Dr. Joseph Carrese, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins Berman Institute of Bioethics. Dr. Reshma Jagsi, an ethicist and radiation oncologist at the University of Michigan and lead author of the survey, said she was worried about striking the right balance between the need for funds and the risk of alienating patients. ""We know how important philanthropic funds are to the institutions where we work,"" she said. ""Yet we have a discomfort that is natural, especially in the context of that sacred patient-physician relationship."" Some patients do appreciate an opportunity to donate and to show their gratitude to their doctors and the medical institution where they received care, she said. Dr. Jagsi began probing these questions five years ago with a survey of cancer specialists. Nearly half had been taught to identify wealthy patients, she found, and a third said they had been asked to solicit donations directly from patients. Some 3 percent said they had been promised payments if a patient donated.

To Dr. Jagsi's surprise, no one followed up with a survey of patients and the general public. So she decided to do it. The new survey involved a representative sample of the United States population and three other groups: wealthy people, cancer patients and patients with heart disease. The responses were generally the same among all the groups. But the wealthy patients were slightly more likely to find it acceptable for big donors to get special treatment in return for their contributions. Asked if they approved of doctors directly asking patients to donate when the patients had not brought it up, 85.8 percent of the general public disapproved, as did 80.5 of people with incomes above $250,000, 85.5 percent of cancer patients and 88.9 percent of heart patients. Asked if it was permissible for doctors to give patients' names to the hospital's fund-raising office without permission, 91.5 percent of the general public said no, as did 89.1 percent of wealthy people, 93.7 percent of cancer patients and 94 percent of heart patients. Respondents almost universally disapproved of allowing fund-raising offices to check the value of patients' homes or to review other available information to find out which patients were wealthy. Ethicists said they were not surprised by the survey's results. There is a long history of abuses of the doctor-patient relationship, including bribes, kickbacks, self-referrals and charitable contributions, noted Dr. Jonathan Moreno, an ethicist at the University of Pennsylvania.

Fund-raising that crosses ethical lines is unacceptable, he added, and not so different. Even Hippocrates worried about these issues, advising doctors not to give special treatment to the wealthy and to provide care without compensation to patients who had little money. But current practices at many medical centers are hard to justify, he added. ""Absent evidence that soliciting patients with financial means makes much difference to an institution's financial viability, and in an era of rampant mistrust, it's best to forgo such practices,"" Dr. Moreno said. But donations are important to medical centers, said Dr. Marschall Runge, dean of the University of Michigan Medical School and chief executive of its health system. Donations to the university medical center, for example, help defray costs for patients without insurance who are transported by helicopter for urgent care. Yet Dr. Runge recognized the potential for conflicts between the medical system's need for money and its obligations to treat patients in the most ethical and honest way. Dr. Jagsi has helped Dr. Runge and others in the hospital's administration formulate policies that prohibit doctors from directly asking patients to donate. ""If a patient says, 'Gee, I'd like to help. Is there anything I can do?,' the doctor would approach the development office,"" Dr. Runge said. ""But development will never approach a patient without the physician's consent."" The medical center also does not give big donors special privileges, although that is a common practice elsewhere, Dr. Runge said.","Hospitals are increasingly soliciting donations from patients, and the patients don't much like it, a new survey finds.",580f8540-928a-5757-a187-fcb44c7a6fdd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/21/science/21DONATE1/21DONATE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=08c84284981cdd148f143345c2a2b1f19d8eec11b8dbce5170cf5e6c752f0604&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Administrators at the University of Michigan Medical School have formulated policies regarding how patients may be asked to donate.,580f8540-928a-5757-a187-fcb44c7a6fdd,N24News/imgs/580f8540-928a-5757-a187-fcb44c7a6fdd.jpg,1
Art & Design,"Overlooked in Atlanta, Black Female Artists Try Miami",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/arts/design/atlanta-black-female-artists-art-basel-miami-beach.html,"The artists Grace Kisa, Angela Davis Johnson and Evelyn Quinones at TILA Studios in suburban Atlanta before their recent trip to Art Basel Miami Beach, where they hoped for a break.

ATLANTA -- Grace Kisa's whimsical sculpture, ""Love is an Open Door,"" features two blue porcelain faces, one with a bluebird on its head, atop brass candlestick bodies. This is her signature -- using coils, bottle caps and other unconventional materials inspired by the Kenyan tradition of creating art with found objects. But gallery owners and collectors unfamiliar with the East African aesthetic have closed their doors, she said, calling her sculptures spooky voodoo dolls. Angela Davis Johnson got a similar response when she showed curators her paintings, which almost always feature black women and fabrics to pay homage to her seamstress mother. One, ""An open mouth creek,"" depicts a black girl with sad eyes and blue hair whose mouth is shut -- though she looks like she wants to talk. It's a piece that speaks to the silencing of black women throughout history. Ms. Johnson has been told that her work is too political and that she should stay away from race-related issues if she wants to be commercially viable. ""I was told once to focus on black women in a church setting because that is what buyers love,"" Ms. Davis Johnson recalled.

Recently, to connect with curators and prospective buyers, 10 female artists tried something dramatic and different: underrepresented in Atlanta, they headed to Art Basel Miami Beach, hoping to get their break at one of the most dynamic, diverse art events in the country. ""We've seen a lot of black women exhibit their work here, but not on the level of their white peers,"" said Tiffany LaTrice, the owner of TILA Studios, an art studio and exhibition space for African-American women in the working-class East Point suburb, who organized the women's Miami trip. In Atlanta, she pointed out, emerging female artists are often funneled into ""entry-level shows that aren't really curated."" ""They have to wait a longer time than their peers,"" she said, ""so they're usually older when they hit their stride and I don't think it has to be that way.""

Ms. LaTrice has made it her mission to change that. Several months ago she contacted Franklin Sirmans, director of the Perez Art Museum Miami (known as PAMM), a contemporary art museum, about presenting the women's work and hosting a brunch during fair week. While Mr. Sirmans was unfamiliar with Ms. LaTrice's group, he has had his eye on Atlanta as an epicenter of black culture since he studied at Morehouse College there. With sponsorships and crowd funding support, the group headed to Miami. In addition to Ms. Johnson and Ms. Kisa, it included the painters Ariel Dannielle, Ebony Black and Sachi Rome; the multimedia artists Christa David and Shon Pittman; the graphic artists Ayanna Smith and Jasmine Nicole Williams; and the photographer Evelyn Quinones. Their work would be on display on video screens at PAMM during Art Basel. Kate Atwood, executive director of ChooseATL, a program of the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce, acknowledged that the city had a long way to go before it could compete with New York and Los Angeles in creating a supportive ecosystem for artists. (ChooseATL followed the artists' journeys to Art Basel Miami Beach on its streaming channel, THEA.) ""We need to make sure that we're not losing that talent anymore,"" Ms. Atwood said. Signs of progress made by nonwhite artists have filled the news, from rising museum acquisitions to new curatorial positions to the top prices gained recently in auctions. Yet African-American artists and curators interviewed for this article said progress comes slowly, with many barriers to success. According to the Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau there are 50 art galleries for a city of nearly 500,000 people -- in a state that bounces between 48th and 50th in arts funding. The artists spoke of limited access to the city's cultural gatekeepers, who are mostly white. In addition, many black women who are the primary breadwinners for their families cannot afford the studio fees, ranging up to $1,000 per month, that would grant them access to a peer network. An artist herself, Ms. LaTrice, 29, understands their struggles. Born in Chattanooga, Tenn., she moved to New York and then to Atlanta after earning her master's degree in women's history from Sarah Lawrence College. She had no network or connections before she formed TILA. Today her studio trains women how to write a strong artist statement, develop a CV and shoot their work professionally, not just on an iPhone. Her studio is a resource ""so they don't feel alone,"" she said.

Ms. Kisa, 50, a full-time artist with a home studio, wistfully recalled the 1990s as a golden age, with the arrival of the National Black Arts Festival drawing talent from all over the world to sell their work. ""To be able to walk down the aisle and see work that I saw on 'The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air' or 'The Steve Harvey Show' -- that show was more than a market, it was a cultural experience,"" Ms. Kisa said. She added that day care centers brought children to the fair to see the work of the artists -- and ""they'd go, 'Girls can draw?'"" When the predominantly white-owned galleries in the upscale Buckhead district did show the work of black artists, ""they might have one male and one female,"" Ms. Kisa said -- something, artists point out, that hasn't changed much. A handful of black-owned galleries opened to meet the demand of clients looking for African-American artists, but many went out of business after the financial crisis in 2008. And so artists like Ms. Kisa have sought alternative venues, traveling to Jazz Fest in New Orleans to find buyers, but watching the cost of a booth, lodging and transportation slash profits. Even if Ms. Kisa finds representation by a top-tier gallery in Atlanta, the standard commission is 50 percent, and her prices are not currently high enough to justify splitting profits with the gallery. Alan Avery, a gallery owner here for nearly 40 years, said he's looking to represent work with ""archival potential,"" made with materials ""that can go into a museum and hold up over time"" -- but not all emerging artists can afford expensive materials.

Of 42 artists on his roster, two are black women (he exhibits and sells work by Kara Walker and represents Fabiola Jean-Louis, a photographer whose work addresses the historical treatment of black women from past centuries). Mr. Avery said that he didn't mind work that deals with difficult subjects like race, but said that for the first 25 years of his career, African-American artists brought work to him that reinforced stereotypes. ""Every painter was doing black men with big lips blowing trumpets,"" he said. ""They were doing it to appeal to what they thought was the art buyer."" He added, ""You have someone come along like Fabiola or Michi Meko, and they're having some of the same conversation about race, but from a different perspective."" Arnika Dawkins, one of the city's few black female gallery owners, said that she did not show any of the kind of work that Mr. Avery described. She opened her gallery in a predominantly African-American, middle-class neighborhood in southwestern Atlanta in 2012 and exhibits fine art photography on subjects related to African-American history and current events. But the stereotype conundrum is familiar to Brenda Fannin, who opened her Buckhead gallery four years ago after leaving a successful executive career at Verizon and Microsoft. The work she shows by artists of color is mostly abstract. ""Am I being embraced by black collectors? No,"" Ms. Fannin said, adding that her taste is not what they expect. On the other hand, she says, white art collectors are not willing to buy from a black gallery owner either. ""We fear what we don't know,"" she added.

Ms. Quinones, 47, who is Afro-Latina, said she had grappled with isolation since she moved here from New York. ""There have been times when people will say to me 'you're black' and another person will say 'she's not black, she speaks Spanish,' and they only consider black to be African-American, but black is worldwide."" Her work focuses on people who are ignored. One photo, of a homeless woman on Peachtree Street, is now a part of Fulton County's permanent collection, but translating those wins into a living hasn't happened yet (she has a day job as a graphic designer). Finding a peer network seemed impossible until she joined Sistagraphy, a collective of black women photographers. In Miami, at the brunch at PAMM, 250 black women artists gathered, and Ms. Quinones watched her work streaming on a video screen. She described the experience as ""empowering and inspiring,"" and connected with artists she had long admired, including the multimedia artist Firelei Baez, from the Dominican Republic. ""The most valuable thing has been bonding with other women artists,"" Ms. Quinones said. ""This experience has given me the confidence to experiment more and work on the ideas that I have been holding onto into my head."" So, did an appearance at Art Basel Miami Beach propel any of their careers? It's too soon to tell. For Ms. Davis Johnson, 37, the trip to Miami offered exposure to a global audience. ""I've been wanting to go to Art Basel for years but there's always been a barrier, whether it's with my children or finances,"" said Ms. Johnson, who is a single mother to a 6-year-old and 4-year-old. She calls her children ""museum babies"" and brought them to the fair with her.

She found the streets of Miami draped with art by people from all around the world, and explained that just being in that creative space could make all the difference for her career trajectory. ""To see a room full of black women who are not only saying that they're artists, but they're living it -- people I admired for so long -- it was perfection,"" Ms. Davis Johnson said. ""People were talking about motherhood, being an art professional and the dedication it takes. I feel my craft, how I approach work, has shifted because of the works that I've seen."" Beyond the brunch, going with the group to Miami empowered her to claim a seat at the international art table, despite the barriers. ""I am not interested in waiting for someone to say yes before I can share work,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm going to walk away from this experience broader, and with a deeper drive to make work that is illuminating us.""",Would an appearance at Art Basel Miami Beach help ten women scale the barriers of rejection or aesthetic misunderstanding they found in Georgia?,9df0b045-45cf-56c3-b400-3071e981f48a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/arts/16artbasel-miami1/16artbasel-miami1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7c3e63807e6929cc97c6634c78d423369889311c94b46515901743317da9e471&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The artists Grace Kisa, Angela Davis Johnson and Evelyn Quiñones at TILA Studios in suburban Atlanta before their recent trip to Art Basel Miami Beach, where they hoped for a break.",9df0b045-45cf-56c3-b400-3071e981f48a,N24News/imgs/9df0b045-45cf-56c3-b400-3071e981f48a.jpg,14
Music,Aching Lullaby: The Week in Classical Music,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/25/arts/music/classical-music-youtube.html,"[Read all of our classical music coverage here.] Readers and listeners, here's wishing you a very happy, and hopefully relaxing, Memorial Day weekend. On Monday I went to the premiere screening of a restored version of Meredith Monk's ""Quarry"" at Anthology Film Archives. (Seth Colter Walls did a fascinating interview with her a few days before, with excerpts from the restoration.) There are dated aspects to the piece, but also passages of great beauty and performances of intense commitment. (Here, in very much not restored footage, is an amazing Ping Chong as the nameless Dictator.) It was a poignant moment when, during a question and answer period after the screening, the handful of original performers who were in the audience were asked to stand.

Also, I was deeply impressed by the playing of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in Beethoven and Mahler (and Tony Tommasini was equally enthusiastic about the National Symphony Orchestra). The coming Next Wave Festival at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the first to be organized by David Binder, finds music depressingly next-to-nonexistent. There's more interest in this vague, tiny squib of a mission statement for Stefan Herheim's upcoming Berlin production of Wagner's ""Ring"" than there was in Robert Lepage's entire cycle at the Metropolitan Opera. And Alex Ross memorably sniffs at the Shed's programming as ""Gesamtkunstwerk by Skype."" ZACHARY WOOLFE

As Ben Miller writes in this sharp preview, productions of these operas have been hard to come by -- in part because of Stockhausen's extraordinary staging requirements. Most famous of these, perhaps, is the ""Helicopter String Quartet,"" from ""Mittwoch aus Licht,"" in which each member of a string quartet boards a different helicopter, and plays the work after taking off into the air. Paradoxically, this most difficult-to-stage portion of ""Licht"" has long been the easiest section of the cycle to hear at home. While recordings of most of ""Licht"" can only be purchased by mail order, from the Stockhausen Verlag, a studio recording of the ""Helicopter String Quartet"" has long been more widely available on a release by the Arditti String Quartet. You won't derive any sense of the overall ""Licht"" narrative from this string quartet, though the work does provide a look at Stockhausen's vibrant imagination, as tremolo playing from the string instruments collides with the whirring of propeller blades. SETH COLTER WALLS

On Sunday, at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Leon Botstein led The Orchestra Now in a program called ""Abstraction in Music and Art,"" tied to one of the Met's current exhibitions. With just about 45 minutes of playing, this was more of a lecture than it was a traditional orchestral concert. But the stretches of commentary and the performances both had their moments. Mr. Botstein delivered some learned, witty remarks (complete with slide show) on the aesthetic ties between Anton Webern, Morton Feldman and the visual art scenes of their respective eras. Webern's ""Six Pieces for Orchestra"" was played sensitively, twice, both before and after the intermission.

Yet the real star of the show was the belated New York premiere of Feldman's ""Orchestra"": a nearly 20-minute work of drifting sublimity that predates the composer's ""Neither,"" a one-act opera with a text by Samuel Beckett. Mr. Botstein and the players did justice to the strangeness of ""Orchestra."" A meditative mood prevailed through whisper-quiet passages and more formidable, massed ones. And the strings brought a sneaky sense of unease to the haunting melodic line that reappears throughout the work's final minutes. That same riff turns up, later, in ""Neither"" -- as well as in ""Elemental Procedures,"" another piece that Feldman drafted before the opera. (Feldman fans can find recordings of both ""Orchestra"" and ""Elemental Procedures"" on a recent recording from the Wergo label.) SETH COLTER WALLS

The pianist Daniil Trifonov is clearly drawn to the turbulent, mercurial, sometimes downright strange elements of Schumann's fantastical piano music, as he showed earlier this year in a recital at Carnegie Hall. That evening he performed the quirky collection of short pieces called ""Bunter Blatter"" (""Colored Leaves""), almost never played complete, and tore through another rarity, the ""Presto Passionato."" (He will play that program again on July 26 at Caramoor in Katonah, N.Y.) Last Saturday Mr. Trifonov played Schumann's Piano Concerto with the Met Orchestra and Valery Gergiev at Carnegie Hall. (The orchestra returns with Yannick Nezet-Seguin on June 3 and June 14.) Not surprisingly, he brought out the rhapsodic Romanticism of the music. Yet I was even more impressed by the grace and clarity of his playing, especially in the dreamy slow movement and the buoyant, rippling finale.","Daniil Trifonov playing Schumann, Morton Feldman and the composer-pianist Kelly Moran were among the highlights.",d57a0ae0-c7e8-554e-a2c1-eca22d5882de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/25/arts/25moments/25moments-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=98396487e85323471c281c4377515ac2a1003c03bf656877ae12582c8467ca85&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Meredith Monk in her opera ""Quarry,"" a restored film version of which was screened this week.",d57a0ae0-c7e8-554e-a2c1-eca22d5882de,N24News/imgs/d57a0ae0-c7e8-554e-a2c1-eca22d5882de.jpg,12
Art & Design,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/31/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,"Edmundo Meza (1955-85), known as Mundo, was a young artist and activist who died of AIDS-related causes. His name and creative and social networks have inspired ""Axis Mundo: Queer Networks in Chicano L.A.,"" a show at 205 Hudson Gallery and the Leubsdorf Gallery at Hunter College. Mundo, of course, translates as ""world,"" and this exceptionally rich show, part of the ""Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA"" project initiated by the Getty Foundation, includes more than 50 artists and offers a primer on queer artists based in the Chicano communities of Los Angeles from the late 1960s through the early 1990s. Bodies, appearances and posing are key throughout the show. Jef Huereque's painting ""My Parents in Their Matching Zoot Suits"" (1973) and Judith F. Baca's '70s photographs of herself as a femme fatale hark back to 1940s Los Angeles, while Laura Aguilar's pictures document people who frequented the Plush Pony lesbian bar in the '90s. Videos of the punk band Nervous Gender from the '80s and photographs of performance works created by Elsa Flores, Les Petites Bonbons and other artists display a variety of approaches.

One object that resurfaces here -- second only to the simultaneously paraded and parodied macho mustache -- is a T-shirt that says ""Maricon,"" whose wearers (and particularly the group the Maricon Collective) are proudly appropriating a Spanish slur for gay men and turning it into a rallying slogan. Clothing was also central to Mr. Meza and Simon Doonan's window displays at the Maxfield Bleu boutique in West Hollywood in the 1980s, shown here in photographs (although Mr. Meza's figurative paintings are, to my eyes, less successful). The explosion of creativity concentrated in ""Axis Mundo"" is notable partly because much of it happened outside institutions. It was inspired by fine art as well as by movies, television, fashion, comic books and performers like the gender-bending David Bowie, with a mind toward what the show organizers call ""world-making"" or fostering alternative ""mundos."" In this sense, ""Axis Mundo"" serves as a reminder that art happens everywhere, on the margins or rising out of activism and presenting itself vociferously in the streets and elsewhere. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

Organized by Taylor Trabulus and the artist Reba Maybury at Gavin Brown downtown, ""Putting Out"" is an 18-artist paean to the sexual power of controlling the narrative. Hal Fischer's perfectly-pitched 1977 photograph ""Signifiers for a Male Response"" briefly explains a few classic sartorial signals, like a handkerchief worn on the left or keys on the right, once used among gay men, while an equally lovely 2018 collage by Frida Orupabo comprises images of women's body parts cut out and pinned back together with delicate violence. Two heart-wrenching photographs of Hollywood hustlers by Philip-Lorca diCorcia turn the act of posing, which Mr. diCorcia paid for at his subjects' going rates, into a commodified sexual performance of its own, and six crumpled bronze iterations of Elizabeth Stephens's ""The Porn Star/Academic Bronzed Panty Collection"" are extravagantly discomfiting.

But the show's intellectual engine is its pairing of three prints from Leigh Ledare's 2012 series ""An Invitation,"" with the performance artist Cosey Fanni Tutti's 2003 diptych ""Sexy Confessions of a Shop Assistant, Experience Bedtime Novel, Vol. 1 No. 9."" Mr. Ledare's project superimposes photographs of a naked woman with her face redacted on front pages of The New York Times; Cosey Fanni Tutti's piece consists of all the pages from a 1970s erotic novel, illustrated with more naked photos. Mr. Ledare's photos, ostensibly originating from a private commission from a ""prominent European couple,"" are displayed along with an elaborate legal agreement concerning their use, while Cosey Fanni Tutti's all feature herself. His images depict the ambiguous relationship between a sexually objectified woman and the person looking at her -- between photographer and model -- while hers draw the gallery visitor directly into the same ambiguity by making the artist herself the subject. In both cases, though, once the work is in the gallery, it's the artist who's in charge. WILL HEINRICH

The work of the Cameroon-born Pascale Marthine Tayou illustrates the complications of the global art model in which artists adopt a handful of industry-approved elements -- found objects, pop culture, some form of political critique -- and inject local details. In his solo exhibition, ""Colorful Line,"" at Richard Taittinger, the formula sometimes works. More often, it does not. An exuberant wall installation, ""Plastic Tree"" (2018), stands at the entrance, with plastic bags in bright colors attached to tree branches, a simple and disturbing reminder of how little things, like the single-use plastic bag, add up to huge environmental consequences. The vivid colors of this work also connect with the show's title, which refers to the ""color line"" of racial segregation, as well as to King Louis XIV's original ""Code Noir"" (1685) decree that defined the conditions of slavery in the French colonial empire.

Race and color are best addressed in the ""Kids Mascarade"" series of photographs that show children in red-soiled landscapes wearing plastic animal masks that appear suspiciously, menacingly Caucasian. Less successful works use traditional forms of sub-Saharan African sculpture, but with found objects like pots and bowls, collaging the ethnographic with the post-colonial in a simplistic and familiar move that feels reminiscent of the Indian artist Subodh Gupta. What goes unquestioned here is context: the collision of the global-gallery universe and the street or junk heaps of other worlds. Mr. Tayou straddles both (he lives in Belgium as well as Cameroon), but what about his audience? Most of the work here feels vapid and generic, not questioning enough the soil and the ground we stand on, be it red, black, white or concrete. MARTHA SCHWENDENER

This show, organized by the artist Carl D'Alvia, is about the human form -- specifically distortions of it, as the title says -- but for the 16 contributors, the goal seems less fidelity to outward appearances than to emotional states. They playfully use the body to render the complexity, comedy and vulnerability of our condition. Sally Saul's ""Blue Lady"" (2018) holds perky flowers but looks apprehensive. She stands next to another of Ms. Saul's pieces, which features a skull whose eye sockets and bone plates appear set in a permanent expression of confusion and concern. The message: Our anxieties don't leave us even when we're dead. Behind them, a self-portrait by Robert Arneson features a brick imprinted with his name on its head; titled ""Balancing Act"" (1975), the work depicts the burden that bearing one's own identity can be. A nearby Elizabeth Catlett sculpture, ""Faces for Two Worlds"" (1980), takes up this idea more earnestly: A bronze head with two opposing faces visualizes the concept of double consciousness. There are few complete bodies in ""Distortions""; instead, a sense of fragmentation prevails. It's best expressed in the work of Caroline Wells Chandler, whose pairs of legs, hand making a peace sign, buttocks that looks like two meatballs, and other colorful, crocheted parts are spread across a wall in the gallery. All of them seem to emerge from what could be bodies of water or portals, suggesting the radical possibilities of rebirth.

Style,Dressing the Part: Melania Trump at the White House Easter Egg Roll,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/18/style/melania-trump-white-house-easter-egg-roll.html,"Since the Easter Egg Roll was revived under Betty Ford, most of the first ladies who have hosted the event wore suits, or at least jackets, suggesting it was a professional commitment. Hillary Clinton displayed her penchant for rainbow-colored pantsuits when she was host, resplendent one year in buttercup yellow, another in grass green. When the Obamas were in the White House, they significantly relaxed the rules, the president often going without a tie or jacket, and Michelle Obama most often in pants with a J. Crew T-shirt or cardigan and Converse (one Tracy Reese floral dress excepted). The message was one of a new, more relaxed, modern and active era.

But just as the Ralph Lauren suit that Mrs. Trump wore during the inaugural parade called to mind Jackie Kennedy and Camelot, the pink dress called to mind another, more rarefied time. It was for neither work nor play, but rather a Great Gatsby garden party.

Indeed, in its unique, made-to-order-ness, it was itself a rarefied garment -- Mr. Pierre does not have his own commercial collection, so he will not be reproducing the dress, as he acknowledged -- and thus in line with Mr. Trump's image-making. This is not about outreach or accessibility. It's about aspirational role-play of a highly telegenic kind.

That's why in so many ways Mrs. Trump's clothes increasingly seem like costumes for a series titled ""In The White House"": a perfect camera-ready version of what one imagines a first lady might wear, from the almost military-inspired suits and coats she has been choosing for various official appearances -- the belted white trench coat from The Row she wore at the International Women of Courage Awards; the Dolce & Gabbana jacket she wore for her official portrait; the belted green dress she wore to accompany Queen Raina of Jordan to a Washington charter school -- to the more romantic, but minimal, organzas of Mr. Pierre.","The Hervé Pierre frock was another of Mrs. Trump's camera-ready choices, just what you imagine a first lady might wear.",b7c9d66d-14d4-5edf-ac17-8451db87b86d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/19/fashion/18otr-A/18otr-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=880e93c509eccda8ecd2586efa705ddacf3dc07e8cb2ead0afea8f1516c8a3a4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Melania Trump in a dress by Hervé Pierre, with President Trump and their son Barron, at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll.",b7c9d66d-14d4-5edf-ac17-8451db87b86d,N24News/imgs/b7c9d66d-14d4-5edf-ac17-8451db87b86d.jpg,15

He said he wanted to set it up on a filing cabinet so we could see a dashboard he'd built that allowed us to monitor data about NYT Cooking in real time: what groups of readers were searching for at any given moment; what they were reading; what they were sharing on social media.

As Craig Finn sings in ""Chillout Tent,"" the Hold Steady song about two kids who meet-cute at a concert where they've both overdosed, ""It was kind of sexy, but it was kind of creepy."" Still, Hugh's monitor sits humming on the filing cabinet to this day, and from it I can tell you with a significant amount of confidence that the two things users of our site and apps are most interested in - like, all of the time - are salmon and chicken.

Sports,Tiger vs. Phil (and Tom vs. Peyton) Turn Rivalry Into Laughs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/24/sports/golf/tiger-woods-tom-brady-manning-mickelson-result.html,"The charity golf match pitting Tiger Woods and Peyton Manning against Phil Mickelson and Tom Brady on Sunday figured to be good TV. It had big names, longstanding rivalries spanning two sports, an intriguing combination of talents and the prospect of the unforeseen. To say it did not disappoint would be an understatement. Because, seriously, did anyone truly expect these developments? Right from the start, Brady played so horrendously -- in one 30-minute stretch he put consecutive tee shots in the woods, a pond and on a cart path next to the out of bounds -- that he was mocked by the guest TV analyst Charles Barkley, whose golf swing is as bad as any ever captured on video. Brady looked more disgusted than he had after his final N.F.L. pass last season, and that was a pick-6 in a playoff rout. Twitter followers in the 44 states outside New England were jubilant and could not type their taunts of Brady fast enough. A grinning Bill Belichick must have felt vindicated for giving up on an aging athlete clearly on the decline. Brooks Koepka, the world's third-ranked golfer, who was watching from his Florida home, posted to Twitter that he would donate $100,000 to coronavirus relief efforts if Brady parred a hole on the front nine.

""Shut your mouth, Chuck,"" Brady yelled in response to Barkley's commentary, which in this exhibition was delivered directly into an earpiece Brady was wearing.
* None
* Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. Oh, yes, and then, with his back to the television cameras, Brady bent over to retrieve his golf ball from the seventh hole and split his pants for all to see. Do you think that elicited a response on social media? Brady's dramatic shot also gave the Brady-Mickelson team a jolt of momentum at a time when it was being trounced. And magically, Brady suddenly started to play better. The competition at the Medalist Golf Club in Hobe Sound, Fla., grew close and had juice with genuinely biting, but funny, banter between the participants.

And it went down to the final putt on the last hole with Woods and Manning winning, 1-up. Moreover, with the help of Brady's comeback, and the solid play and winsome personality of Manning, Sunday's match provided more than four hours of entertaining live sports that will most likely be a major television ratings success. The event was originally billed as a rematch of sorts, pitting Woods and Mickelson two years after they played a boring head-to-head contest on Thanksgiving weekend in 2018, on a pay-per-view broadcast was riddled with problems. Sunday's reprise was saved by the N.F.L. interlopers, which really might not have been a surprise since everyday golfers love to imagine how they would handle the pressure of playing with top golf pros on national TV. Hint: We would look like Brady before the seventh hole. Yes, to be sure, Brady and Manning, two of the most accomplished athletes of the last 25 years, are not average people plucked off the street. But as golfers they sure looked like it from time to time. And watching Woods and Mickelson try to work with that level of golf expertise to win a match was fascinating.

And here are two discoveries from watching that experience unfold: Woods is not warm and fuzzy, but his golf game and surgically rebuilt back are both in terrific shape. Woods rarely missed a shot of any kind and consistently hammered his driver, a sometime nemesis, accurately and with power. Woods's swing was fluid, he walked with ease and he frequently bent and stretched without any apparent discomfort. His short game could be dazzling. Mickelson thinks he is ""Phil"" Nye the Science Guy. Mickelson's dissertations to Brady on how to stroke a 10-foot putt would go on for about two minutes with detailed explanations about how the shading of a green surface reflected the grass grain and would affect the rolling of a putt. It was great stuff for golf geeks, but by the end of the match it was as if Mickelson was trying out for a part on ""The Big Bang Theory."" The match was not always the finest promotion of social distancing. The golfers stood less than six feet apart from time to time. There were occasional fist bumps. Once or twice, a golf ball was snatched from the green and flipped to a partner.",Tiger Woods beat Phil Mickelson in a head-to-head rematch while their mortal-looking N.F.L. partners — Tom Brady and Peyton Manning — drew barbs and laughs.,2af01181-4dcb-59e7-b48b-52bb9a378de6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/24/sports/24golf-match-1/merlin_172804188_2bcf8fa3-77cd-4979-a27a-e33b434f0668-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=97d555f5d5bb7f5eabc97f4bd80589e96a3b79b599ad17a256f631f76983b495&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Peyton Manning reading the green with Tiger Woods, who had not played since finishing last at an event in February.",2af01181-4dcb-59e7-b48b-52bb9a378de6,N24News/imgs/2af01181-4dcb-59e7-b48b-52bb9a378de6.jpg,9
Opinion,What Grade Does Trump's China Trade Deal Deserve? Incomplete,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/opinion/editorials/trump-china-trade-deal.html,"The key deal terms are straightforward: China has promised to buy a heaping pile of stuff from the United States over the next two years, and to make it a little easier for American companies to do business in China. The United States has promised to stop raising tariffs.

President Trump is justified in describing these terms as something new. The United States historically has focused on negotiating the rules of international trade, and then allowing economic conditions to determine the volume. The Trump administration, by contrast, is primarily focused on increasing the volume of exports to China. It wrested from China an agreement to increase its total purchases from $186 billion in 2017 to $309 billion in 2021.

There's no real precedent for that kind of rapid increase in trade with another country, and some analysts doubt that China even intends to fully meet the terms. The bigger issue, however, is that even if China comes through -- even if America ships a lot more soybeans and natural gas, and sells more financial and technical services -- the United States may not benefit.

The deal is structured to reduce the annual trade deficit between the two countries, allowing Mr. Trump to claim a political victory. Mr. Trump views trade as a competition between the United States and China, and he follows the balance of trade in much the same way that sports fans keep track of the score. But bilateral trade balances are economically insignificant. It doesn't matter if a nation has a trade deficit with China if it has offsetting trade surpluses with other nations. And in this case, much of what China has agreed to buy from the United States would have been sold to other nations. Increasing exports to China doesn't mean that the United States is increasing overall exports. The economic benefit may be quite small.

The commitments also end after two years. China is making no promises beyond 2021.

There are important downsides, too. The United States is essentially demanding that China shift trade away from other countries, some of which are American allies. The United States also has long pushed China to develop a more market-oriented economy. This deal, by contrast, encourages China's government to orchestrate purchasing, most likely with a heavy reliance on the very state-owned enterprises the United States has long sought to constrain. The short-term benefits could come at the expense of America's longer-term interests.",The cost of President Trump's China strategy continues to grow. He has yet to show that the benefits are worth it.,ca6cacc0-5f88-5cd1-b0ed-4df1b1b5eeac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/16/opinion/16chinadealWeb/16chinadealWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7d7b18b2c80c88c17203e03b2d14556b5823a24e797d1c7a190bb1ababfa848e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Vice Premier Liu He of China and President Trump signed an initial trade deal at the White House on Wednesday.,ca6cacc0-5f88-5cd1-b0ed-4df1b1b5eeac,N24News/imgs/ca6cacc0-5f88-5cd1-b0ed-4df1b1b5eeac.jpg,11

Travel,Five Places to Go in San Diego,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/12/travel/five-places-to-go-san-diego-california-barrio-logan.html,"In San Diego, residents have long heard the charge that their fair city is a place where people put more stock in sunny weather and surfing than in art, architecture and cuisine. But Barrio Logan is challenging that outdated perception. The neighborhood, southeast of downtown, is among its oldest and most diverse. It also has long been a center of Latino culture. Today, a new crop of locally owned art galleries, breweries and restaurants, mostly along Logan Avenue, are popping up alongside the auto body shops and fruterias.

The owner of !Salud! tacos, Ernie Becerra, turned his taco-catering company into a brick and mortar space in 2015. The dinerlike interior evokes the lowrider lifestyle with a tattoo-inspired mural and a pinstripe car hood. The place features tacos like the Barrio, a meat and vegetable stew served on a flour tortilla topped with nopales, avocado and sour cream.","In San Diego's Barrio Logan, locally owned art galleries, breweries and restaurants are popping up alongside auto body shops and fruterías.",4e892da2-f0d3-593c-8b7e-9c3ec7a5b05f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/16/travel/16SURFACING1/16SURFACING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=81f84690f7acb7f53ef5f42efab7b431cf98571b40f82e2236c77048a9e9e807&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"¡Salud! features tacos like the Barrio, a meat and vegetable stew served on a flour tortilla topped with nopales, avocado and sour cream.",4e892da2-f0d3-593c-8b7e-9c3ec7a5b05f,N24News/imgs/4e892da2-f0d3-593c-8b7e-9c3ec7a5b05f.jpg,4
Sports,"College Football Rule Changes: Quicker Replays, Zeros on Jerseys and Social Distancing",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/sports/ncaafootball/college-football-rule-changes.html,"College football is supposed to return in force this month, with the first Football Bowl Subdivision games scheduled for Thursday. If it does -- with stadiums enforcing social distancing, players and coaches in masks on the sidelines and tailgating banned on many campuses -- the sport's rules will be a little different. We spoke with Steve Shaw, the N.C.A.A.'s national coordinator of football officials, and Greg Burks, the coordinator of football officials for the Big 12 Conference, about the new rules for 2020. The pandemic prompted limited changes to the rules themselves.

Team areas, ordinarily marked at the 25-yard lines, have been expanded by 10 yards at each end, giving players, coaches and support staff far more room to spread out along the sidelines. ""This modification is really to allow the head coaches to really reorganize their sidelines and their personnel to promote social distancing,"" said Shaw, who is also the secretary-rules editor for football for the N.C.A.A. ""The blob that kind of follows the ball, we're trying to minimize that."" Speaking of blobs, teams won't be allowed to send phalanxes of players to coin tosses that have long been crowded with honorary captains, photographers and radio reporters. Instead, one captain from each team will join the referee and the umpire at midfield for a distanced gathering. ""That toss is going to look very different with only four people in the center of the field,"" Shaw said.

Waves of activism swept through college football during the off-season. Now, a new N.C.A.A. policy will allow players, with some limits, to use their uniforms to call attention to social justice issues. Patches, ordinarily worn on a jersey's front or sleeve and traditionally used to commemorate events like the 150th anniversary of college football, can now relate to social justice causes if a school or conference approves. Players will not be required to wear any patches. Although the optional patches must be identical among the players who wear them, the nameplate on the back of a jersey will offer more room for individualism. Under the N.C.A.A.'s guidelines, players' surnames may, with the permission of a conference or school, be replaced with ""names/words intended to celebrate or memorialize people, events or other causes."" The words do not have to be the same from one player to another. Iowa State announced this week that its football team would honor Jack Trice, the first Black player at the university and the man for whom its stadium is named, with patches. And East Carolina's coach, Mike Houston, said last month that he expected his team to take advantage of the N.C.A.A.'s new approach. ""We want to be unified in what we stand for,"" Houston said. ""In our locker room, we embrace each other, we embrace the diversity of each other. We want equality for everyone. We want social justice for everyone."" And to help relieve pressure on coaches for single-digit player numbers, the N.C.A.A. has also added another legal numeral for jerseys: 0. For the most of the game, reviews are expected to conclude within two minutes. Replay is a staple of college football, but Shaw and other officials want reviews to conclude more quickly. A new rule says that the ""expectation"" is that most reviews will be finished within two minutes, though analyses that involve multiple elements or could affect the end of the game will not be subject to that timeline.

Exceedingly long reviews, Shaw said, created the possibility of overthinking particular plays, especially ones that deal with relatively simple matters like whether a ball was caught or not. ""If you get close to two minutes and you can't tell or you still are looking for the right view, then that's your answer -- it's time to let it stand and move on and let's keep the game moving,"" Shaw said. ""What is replay really there for? It's to correct obvious errors on the field with indisputable video evidence."" Burks said he expected many replays would wrap up within the two-minute recommendation. But he also said he was telling Big 12 officials to keep their ultimate focus on making the correct call. ""We don't stop the game just out of hand,"" he said. ""When we stop the game, we really think there's something there."" Players don't have to go to the locker room if they're disqualified after a targeting penalty. College football leaders believe the targeting rule is working and prompting players to think twice. Now they want to curb what Burks and Shaw both described as the sport's ""walk of shame."" Players who are disqualified from a game because of targeting will now be allowed to remain in the team area instead of going to the locker room. Players who are ejected for other reasons will still have to leave the area around the field. ""This is an opportunity to say, this is a football play and, in most cases, a targeting disqualification was not because a player was with malice and trying to injure an opponent,"" Burks said. ""Did we want to treat it like we would a fighting foul, or two unsportsmanlikes?""

The answer, Burks said, from coaches and officials was a resounding ""no."" Officiating will look different. Burks acknowledged that 2020 was not a particularly drastic year for playing rule changes -- ""once the game starts,"" he said, ""you'll see things get back to normal pretty quickly"" -- but college sports executives are warning that officiating itself will be unusual because of the pandemic. Electronic whistles are, for instance, being widely recommended. ""The thought of the official going to their mouth 100-plus times a game, or blowing spittle out from the whistle, is not fit for our new environment,"" Shaw said. Officials, who may wear goggles and are expected to wear masks even during plays, have been urged to brush up on the mechanics of working as part of a six- or seven-person crew in case someone tests positive before kickoff, compromising the typical eight-person unit. The traditional crew meetings the night before games will be conducted virtually, even from within the same hotel. Burks insists, though, that the game day standards for officials will remain the same. ""Once the games start, there are no excuses for not performing at the same level that the expectations are every year,"" he said. ""You've got to have the mind-set that once this starts, there are no excuses."" Coaches, officiating executives said, certainly will not be more forgiving of errors. Those new whistles, by the way? They will be black, a change Shaw requested after he tested one that was red and black -- colors that make Georgia fans swell with pride -- and thought back to his days as a Southeastern Conference referee. ""I was just thinking if you go to Auburn and you pull out a Georgia whistle, it's not going to go over very well,"" Shaw said.","Officials will use electronic whistles this year, and we read the updated rules so you don't have to decipher what they're enforcing.",cb0d8145-2e5e-57b4-8e2e-bacf33fb8aa8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/02/sports/02footballrules01/02footballrules01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0ea05a18c0958cde7975a83a27ec8bcb94940f86e8557316e408d074e5dfdf14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ahead of the college football season, referees are being told to brush up on working in smaller crews in case anyone in their eight-person unit tests positive for the coronavirus.",cb0d8145-2e5e-57b4-8e2e-bacf33fb8aa8,N24News/imgs/cb0d8145-2e5e-57b4-8e2e-bacf33fb8aa8.jpg,9
Style,The Glamorous Grandmas of Instagram,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/20/style/instagram-grandmas.html,"""I'm not 20. I don't want to be 20, but I'm really freaking cool. That's what I think about when I'm posting a photo."" Photographed with a hip thrust forward to show off her Margiela apron dress and modishly frayed jeans, Lyn Slater projects a kind of swagger pretty rare among her peers. A professor at the Graduate School of Social Service at Fordham University, with hyper-chic side gigs as a model and blogger, she is known to a wider public as an Instagram idol. Sure, she's 64 , a time when some women her age are feeling pressed to close up shop. But if you are Ms. Slater, that's not going to happen. On Accidental Icon, her influential Instagram account, she tends to vamp in an eye-catching mash-up of Comme des Garcons, Yohji Yamamoto and consignment store finds. Her following, hundreds of thousands strong, skews young, she said, and is responsive to her sass. ""I flaunt it,"" she said. ""I'm not 20. I don't want to be 20, but I'm really freaking cool. That's what I think about when I'm posting a photo.""

Her brash voice is one in a chorus of like-minded contemporaries and women in their 70s and 80s, who are taking on matters of aging with an audacity -- and riveting style -- their mothers might have envied. Married or single, working or not, and most often grandmothers, they are asserting their presence on Instagram, intent, in the process, on subverting shopworn notions of what ""old"" looks and feels like. They are, to hear some tell it, ""100 percent slaying.""

""The idea of what these older women look like has changed,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""If they were stylish in their youth, they will still be stylish now. They continue to be who they were."" That observation is echoed in the Elastic Generation, a 2018 J. Walter Thomson survey of 55- to 72-year-old women in England. ""Our collective understanding of what later life looks like remains woefully outdated,"" Marie Stafford, the European director of the JWT Innovation Group, wrote in her introduction. ""Age no longer dictates the way we live. Physical capacity, financial circumstances and mind-set arguably have far greater influence."" A woman in her 50s, then, ""might be a grandmother or a new mother,"" the study goes on to say. ""She might be an entrepreneur, a wild motorcyclist or a multi-marathon runner. Her lifestyle is not governed by her age but by her values and the things she cares about."" Some of these women and their counterparts abroad are still subscribing to the counterculture values and maverick stance they adopted in the 1960s and '70s. ""We are not going to be little old ladies sitting in a nursing home with blue-rinsed hair,"" said Jenny Kee, @Jennykeeoz, a 71-year-old Australian artist and knitwear designer. ""Or if we are going to be in a nursing home, we'll be there with our marijuana, our health foods and our great sense of style.""

Ms. Slater echoed that sentiment. ""When I was young, we were burning our bras and promoting free love,"" she said. ""We were getting high. Why would we accept the aging image of our mothers?"" In their wardrobes, unfettered self-expression is the rule. Dorrie Jacobson, an 83-year-old former Playboy bunny, piqued interest last year when she began modeling lacy black lingerie on her Senior Style Bible Instagram account. In an interview, as on her feed, she urges followers to ditch cobwebby notions of how a woman her age should dress. ""Wear what you like,"" she said . ""Age-appropriate has nothing to do with it."" That brand of feistiness likely owes a debt to a few playfully cantankerous online role models, women who call themselves ""Insta-grans,"" who have made brazenness a virtue. Making waves, and a little cash on the side, are pop sensations like Baddie Winkle (89-year-old Helen Ruth Elam Van Winkle), whose posts are conceived to flip convention on its head. Snapped in shrilly colorful knits, skimpy swimwear and, in one instance, a pink message T-shirt that reads, ""Be a slut, do whatever you want,"" Ms. Van Winkle has transcended cult status. She has millions of followers and is paid to tout brands like Got2B hair products and Smirnoff on her account, and has made personal appearances at Sephora. There is 69-year-old Lili Hayes, whose posts tend to send up stereotyped images of Jewish mom-ness. Ms. Hayes, who, as her online bio makes clear, is always a little ticked off, underscores her peevishness with a street-wear-inflected style. Her fashion signature: an ever-expanding collection of Supreme caps.

Chalk up their influence to a palpable shift in the wind. Their advent coincides with the stepped-up visibility, and clout, of political outliers like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, whose weathered features loom large these days on theater screens, to say nothing of a voluble coterie of older women in Congress. Entertainment legends like Cher, the redoubtably glamorous grandma in ""Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again,"" which arrives in theaters next month, do their utmost as well to spruce up the image of aging. In an apparently more hospitable climate, designers and advertisers have begun to acknowledge a more mature market, pushing a concept of inclusion to extend not just to race and ethnicity but also to age. Maye Musk, 70, models for Concept Korea and is featured in Harper's Bazaar; Yasmin Le Bon, in her 50s, strikes poses for Armani; and at 65, Isabella Rossellini has returned as a face of Lancome, the beauty brand that dropped her 20 years earlier. Even so, those campaigns can carry a whiff of tokenism. According to the Elastic Generation study, women over 50 are still greatly underrepresented in proportion to their spending power. Also overlooked is their social media savvy. Eschewing stereotypes, 73 percent of participants ""hate the way their generation is patronized when it comes to technology,"" the report says. Six out of 10 say they find tech ""fascinating,"" according to the report, and many of those may actually be more competent using tech than their younger counterparts.

While they court and may relish a surge in attention, some prominent influencers balk at being profiled. ""It's colonizing to be put out there exclusively with women your age,"" Ms. Slater said. ""Every woman should be able to open a magazine and see herself there as part of a mix."" Sarah-Jane Adams, 63, who turned to Instagram to show off the jewelry she sells, makes no references in her posts to her gray hair. ""I don't feel as if I'm trying to play the old card,"" she said. She would rather be judged on the particulars. ""I was a punk,"" she said, ""and before that I was a hippie. Now I've merged the two cultures. I'm part of the Germaine Greer generation. But in the world of social media, I'm simply lumped with all the over-60s."" Privacy is a concern as well. ""Men reach out all the time,"" said Ms. Correll, who has been married for 43 years and is a grandmother of four. ""Sometimes it scares me. I'm constantly deleting their posts.""

Still, the outcome is more often positive. Posting on Instagram reinforces a sense of solidarity that may have been missing elsewhere in their lives. As Mr. Cohen of Advanced Style noted: ""Some of these women don't live in big cities.

That online community encompasses a surprisingly youthful contingent. On Instagram, many of Ms. Slater's followers range in age from 25 to 35. ""Young people don't seem to have the same bias that older people do,"" she said. ""They don't like categories -- they deconstruct all these historical groupings like gender.

Ms. Kee ascribes the enthusiasm of girls in their teens and women in their early 20s to a wish-I'd-been-there mentality. Among her special champions, she said, is her 13-year-old granddaughter, an ardent fan of '60s rock, especially the Beatles.

Travel,"With Mobile Camping, Remote Destinations and Light Footprints",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/05/travel/mobile-camping-tours.html,"Mobile camping experiences, with easily movable tents and gear, are popping up in some of the remotest corners of the world, allowing travelers to explore unspoiled landscapes while leaving a light footprint.

""Authentic connection with the natural world is hard to find when staying in traditional accommodations,"" said Tom Marchant, a founder of the luxury travel outfitter Black Tomato regarding its new mobile camping service Blink, which lets guests customize their experience, from choosing the location to designing their tents. Camps can be set up anywhere in the world -- glaciers, deserts, jungles, coastlines -- and come with a butler, private chef, local guide, driver and masseuse. (All-inclusive rates start at approximately $10,000 per person excluding airfare.) After guests depart the entire camp disappears without a trace.

In Tanzania's central Serengeti, Roving Bushtops' compact camping trucks unpack into six 1,000-square-foot luxury safari tents. The area is abundant year-round with zebras, wildcats, giraffes and elephants, including herds of wildebeests that migrate past the camp from November to March. When taking a break from daily game drives, guests can linger on their private decks, enjoy unlimited complimentary massages or take balloon rides. All-inclusive rates start at $990 per person per night including butler service, a la carte dining and a private 4WD vehicle.

The landscape of Bolivia's Uyuni Salt Lake is so surreal that ""Star Wars"" is featuring it as a fictional planet in its coming film. Travelers can experience its otherworldly appeal with Crillon Tours' camping expeditions in fully loaded Airstream campers equipped with comfortable beds, a kitchen table, hot showers and a stocked minibar. A private driver, guide and chef accompany guests as they explore the salt flats' giant cactuses and flamingos and surrounding Andean villages.

Movies,'The Kid' Review: A Wild West Showdown Spurs a Coming-of-Age Dilemma,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/movies/the-kid-review.html,"Starting as violently as it plans to continue, Vincent D'Onofrio's ""The Kid"" drops us into a savage altercation as Rio (Jake Schur), 13, kills his abusive father before slicing the face of his scummy uncle, Grant (Chris Pratt). Primed by the boy's affectless narration (here, when characters aren't practicing brutality, they're talking about it), we intuit that what will follow for Rio and his older sister, Sara (Leila George), is unlikely to be pretty.

Set in the American Southwest in 1879, ""The Kid"" feels less like an actual movie than a table-napkin idea for one. A fateful encounter with Billy the Kid (Dane DeHaan) and his nemesis, Sheriff Pat Garrett (Ethan Hawke), lands the siblings in Santa Fe and back in Grant's clutches. For Sara, that means the brothel, where Grant seemingly has a season pass; for Rio, it means deciding which of his two new acquaintances he can trust to rescue her.","Vincent D'Onofrio's film, structured around a showdown between Billy the Kid and Pat Garrett, suffers from a fuzzy screenplay.",dd24b53a-a807-5090-92a6-aa2b417a2f77,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/08/arts/08thekid1/thekid1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=287c9e661ce906b75c2190b10a7f1cbfb74b31e97051a4fd935d434de33e9418&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dane DeHaan and Ethan Hawke in &ldquo;The Kid.&rdquo;,dd24b53a-a807-5090-92a6-aa2b417a2f77,N24News/imgs/dd24b53a-a807-5090-92a6-aa2b417a2f77.jpg,5
Health,"Do Serial Killers Just Stop? Yes, Sometimes",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/health/serial-killers-golden-state.html,"The Golden State Killer's barrage of rapes and murders began in a gold mining area east of Sacramento in 1976. By 1986, it seemed to have stopped. With the arrest Tuesday of Joseph James DeAngelo, 72, who has been charged so far with eight counts of murder, more than 30 years had passed since the last episode in the series. That long period of quiescence seems to fly in the face of the popular belief that serial rapists and killers are incapable of stopping. But forensic psychiatrists, criminal profilers and homicide detectives who pursue cold cases say that assumption is more myth than reality. Joseph James DeAngelo, upon his arrest this week. ""These are not acts that a person is compelled to do,"" said J. Reid Meloy, a forensic psychologist and professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. ""They are intentional and predatory. There is choice, capacity and opportunity that is exercised.""

Any number of factors can contribute to a dormant stretch. An extensive 2008 study on serial murder for the F.B.I.'s National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime found that killers may quiet down when they find other outlets for their emotions. The study mentioned Dennis Rader, known as the BTK Killer, who murdered 10 people from 1974 to 1991, but had no other victims before being apprehended in 2005. ""During interviews conducted by law enforcement, Rader admitted to engaging in autoerotic activities as a substitute for his killings,"" the report said. Other killers might have changed behavior after moving away from the original epicenter of activity. Ted Bundy mutilated and murdered perhaps more than 30 young women in the 1970s. Yet there were stretches along his peripatetic travels when he was not associated with murders in those areas. In some cases, jobs and families might have stabilized and exacerbating sources of stress might have faded, some experts said.

Dr. Michael H. Stone, a professor of forensic psychiatry at Columbia University who has extensively studied serial killers, noted that Gary Ridgeway, the Green River Killer, murdered prostitutes during his first two difficult marriages. He married a third time, more happily, and the killings dwindled. ""Some of these men have little oases of compassion, within the vast desert of their contempt and hatred of women,"" Dr. Stone said. So far, the authorities have not offered any public explanation as to why the Golden State Killer spree, for which Mr. DeAngelo was arrested this week, began and continued, much less stopped. But some experts point to the most banal explanation: In 1986, when he was 40, Mr. DeAngelo may have aged out. ""The testosterone levels are down,"" Dr. Stone said. ""His capacity to perform is weakened,"" he added, noting that he was merely speculating. The prey drive is lessened. An undated driver's license photo of Dennis Rader, also known as the BTK killer. Mark Safarik, a retired F.B.I. criminal profiler and consultant to crime shows like ""Bones"" and ""The Blacklist,"" recently worked on a study with academic researchers about older sexual homicide offenders. ""They are really rare over age 50,"" he said. ""We just don't see them. Pedophiles over 50, yes. But not rape-murderers."" There is little research on why spree killers desist for reasons other than getting caught. No one knows what has happened to a serial killer of young women on Long Island.

""There has never been a survey of serial killers asking them why they stopped,"" said Eric Witzig, a retired homicide detective and chairman of the Murder Accountability Project, a database of unsolved murders. ""All we have are anecdotal hunches,"" he said. Perhaps a victim struggled and spooked the attacker, he said. The killer ""might think then, 'Maybe I don't want to do this anymore because I might get caught.' Or, 'I want to stop and reflect on the carnage I wreaked in the past.'""

Or, said Dr. Bruce E. Harry, a retired forensic psychiatrist with the University of Missouri medical school: ""Maybe they get tired or bored and just don't want to do it anymore."" Mr. Safarik, the retired F.B.I. crime profiler, was a beat cop in the late 1970s in Davis, Calif. and remembers being on stakeouts for the Golden State Killer, watching with night surveillance scopes for a man scrambling over rooftops or escaping into nearby fields. Then as now, police believed that the suspect had military or law enforcement training, which helped him evade detection. One reason the rapist-murderer may have stopped in the late 80s, speculated Mr. Safarik, is that he was becoming aware of the ability to collect DNA evidence, left by the most meager material. The public was becoming familiar with it, he said, particularly through television dramas. Several experts, underlining the notion that so little is yet known about Mr. DeAngelo -- including most significantly whether he committed the crimes -- wondered whether the criminal behavior did stop entirely in 1986. ""I would want to look at other rapes and murders in the areas where he lived over time,"" Dr. Meloy said. ""I would be skeptical that there was a complete shutdown at age 40.""",Joseph James DeAngelo's arrest occurred more than 30 years after the Golden State Killer's spree ended. Experts cite cases involving murderers whose crimes ceased long before they were caught.,80977fa8-1655-511a-ba44-7e1e3a2e4206,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/27/science/27SERIAL3/27SERIAL3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=253dd8a95e618f01a322d4cc52ea1246ff34d0e14d5c14edbf919b659b4ba4d8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The serial killer Ted Bundy being escorted from court in 1977 in Aspen, Colo.",80977fa8-1655-511a-ba44-7e1e3a2e4206,N24News/imgs/80977fa8-1655-511a-ba44-7e1e3a2e4206.jpg,1
Media,How NBC Finished Second on the Trump Video Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/10/business/media/how-nbc-finished-second-on-the-trump-video-story.html,"Days after a blockbuster video emerged capturing Donald J. Trump, then a reality television host, making vulgar remarks about aggressively kissing and groping women, a question was still reverberating around media and political circles: Why was NBC not the first to report its own story? The footage of Mr. Trump came from a 2005 segment for ""Access Hollywood,"" the syndicated entertainment program owned by NBCUniversal. The video was discovered last Monday by an ""Access Hollywood"" producer, and Andrew Lack, the chairman of NBC News, learned of the tape's existence the next day, according to two people briefed on internal network discussions. Yet on Friday afternoon, it was The Washington Post that posted the video to its website, rocking the political world and earning the envy of journalists across the country. The delay stemmed from a combination of factors, including a legal review, intranet work fiefs and the slow-turning wheels of a sprawling corporate infrastructure, according to several people familiar with the process, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the internal discussions. The Post reporter who obtained the tape, David Fahrenthold, received a copy late Friday morning. When NBC's news division learned that The Post was working on the story, it moved quickly: Within about 10 minutes of The Post's publishing its version, the NBC News correspondent Katy Tur went on MSNBC with a story about the video, showing the footage.

Interviews show that NBC lawyers, erring on the side of caution, examined whether the network could be vulnerable to a lawsuit for airing the recording, and discussed whether it was ethical to use live-microphone audio from a private moment with Mr. Trump -- who was inside a van, off-camera -- that was not intended to be broadcast. Executives at NBC's news division, meanwhile, deferred to their corporate cousins at ""Access Hollywood,"" giving them first crack at airing the footage that was theirs -- even as the entertainment show, unaccustomed to stories of such gravity, took its time. NBC officials, believing that the footage was closely guarded, did not think it was in danger of leaking. Complicating matters was the presence in the tape of Billy Bush, one of NBC's most important on-air personalities, who can be heard discussing a woman's legs and laughing along with Mr. Trump as he jokes about kissing women, and grabbing their genitalia, without their consent. Mr. Bush, who said he was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" by his behavior, is facing an online backlash. Early in the weekend, NBC had no plans to discipline him, but on Sunday evening the network said it was suspending him indefinitely. It was unclear how long he would be away from the show. On Saturday, NBC officials said that they had acted responsibly in vetting the Trump video and that a three-day delay was a short amount of time to prepare a story of such magnitude and sensitivity.

Mark Kornblau, a senior vice president for communications at NBC News, said that throughout the process the news division was always prepared to run with the news and that it applied rigorous journalistic standards in approaching the story. ""The only filter we looked through this story was: Is it newsworthy? Yes,"" Mr. Kornblau said. ""And then how can we, as quickly and as responsibly as possible, get it to publication? We did exactly what you want and expect from a great news organization to get there.""
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. NBC employees have speculated on who might have leaked the ""Access Hollywood"" video to The Post, wondering if someone inside the network believed the due diligence was taking too long. The timing is unfortunate for NBC, which has faced criticism throughout the presidential campaign. The anchor Matt Lauer, for instance, was castigated for his less-than-aggressive questioning of Mr. Trump at a town hall forum last month. NBC also invited Mr. Trump to host ""Saturday Night Live"" during the Republican primary; CNBC held a widely panned Republican primary debate that prompted a backlash from the party; and even Jimmy Fallon, the ""Tonight Show"" host, was dinged by fellow comedians for playfully mussing Mr. Trump's hair during an interview. This latest episode began last Monday, when ""Access Hollywood"" producers read about Mr. Trump's treatment of women on ""The Apprentice,"" and recalled their own 2005 segment featuring Mr. Trump and a trip to a soap opera set. After unearthing the footage of Mr. Trump making crude remarks, Rob Silverstein, the executive producer of ""Access Hollywood,"" informed NBC News executives of the discovery, according to two people familiar with the timeline.

But conversations about how to handle the bombshell moved slowly, in part because of the Rosh Hashana holiday. On Tuesday, Mr. Lack found out about the tape, as two NBCUniversal lawyers, Kimberley D. Harris and Susan E. Weiner, began considering a variety of legal questions. Did NBC have the right to broadcast the tape? Could it be sued? The legal back-and-forth -- and the huge corporate infrastructure at NBC, which is owned by Comcast -- slowed down the process, even though everyone involved acknowledged the tape's newsworthiness, several people said. Still, a plan was put in place: Once the lawyers gave a green light, ""Access Hollywood"" would report the story first, and NBC News could quickly follow up. ""Access Hollywood"" and NBC News were not working in concert on their reports, according to several people. By Friday morning, lacking comment from some principals -- including the Trump campaign -- and with Hurricane Matthew dominating the news cycle, ""Access Hollywood"" producers decided to push their broadcast to Monday, after the second presidential debate. But then The Post called for comment early Friday afternoon. ""Access Hollywood"" and NBC News producers were blindsided. NBC News rushed to pull together a story. On MSNBC's initial report that afternoon, Ms. Tur described the contents of the video, but referred to The Post only once, citing a comment from the Trump campaign that the network had not yet obtained. There is unlikely to be another bombshell from ""Access Hollywood."" A spokeswoman for the show said in a statement: ""We have combed through every interview we have done with Mr. Trump over the past 20 years and at this time, we have not uncovered any other footage that rises to this level."" Rival syndicated entertainment shows like ""Extra,"" ""Inside Edition"" and ""Entertainment Tonight"" are searching for their own newsworthy footage of Mr. Trump, though there are no indications that they have found equally explosive material.",Top NBC officials learned early last week of the video of Donald J.

 Nick LaMela, left, and John LaMela, who are twins, and their sister, Amanda LaMela, live in the same building in the financial district. The three siblings say they have one another's backs -- and a standing Monday-night dinner date.

Last summer, Ana Villafane, 26, left behind her life in Los Angeles and moved to New York to make her Broadway debut playing Gloria Estefan in the musical ""On Your Feet!"" It could have been a very lonely introduction to a new city if not for the fact that her sister, Carmen Villafane, 28, was waiting for her. Carmen helped Ana find a furnished studio, a sublet in Times Square that is just a ""forward roll"" to the theater and about a 10-block stroll up Ninth Avenue to big sister. ""Having her here is grounding,"" Ana said. ""Yeah, I'm surrounded by people, but I don't know any of them. So when you're drowning in that crowd, I know there's one person that not only do I know, but she's family."" Some adult brothers and sisters deliberately choose to live on different coasts or at least in different boroughs from one another, happy to leave behind a childhood rival. But others elect to stay near their siblings and help create a second phase of family life.

""I've had quite a few siblings who wanted to live in close proximity, if not in the same apartment,"" said Tiga McLoyd, an associate broker for Citi Habitats in Manhattan. ""Many of them are New York City transplants who have left friends and family behind. They love the city, but there's a sense of disconnect that never really goes away. Unless you're lucky enough to have roots in the city, spending time with family is not part of the routine."" For Carmen Villafane, the director of communications at Complex, a digital media company aimed at millenials, having her sister nearby is not the same as living close to a friend. ""It's different,"" she said. ""I can sit around with her and not speak, which is a lot of our hangs."" Ana's vocal rest schedule gives the pair plenty of opportunity to communicate in shorthand, whether they're camping out in her dressing room, or at the studio apartment that Carmen rents for $1,850 a month near Columbus Circle, an address well known to Seamless, the online food-ordering service. ""The stretch between our apartments, every spot has become 'our spot,' "" Carmen said. Despite their opposite work schedules, the sisters are able to take yoga classes or get their nails done together, and meet up for breakfast at Margon, a Cuban place between their apartments that offers a taste of home.

The siblings, who grew up in Miami, also look out for each other. When Ana was sick, Carmen dispatched a Postmates delivery of over-the-counter medicines to her. When Carmen succumbed to a seasonal virus, Ana was there for her. Here are more fascinating tales you can't help but read all the way to the end.
* None
* Getting Personal With Iman. The supermodel talks about life after David Bowie, their Catskills refuge and the perfume inspired by their love.
* A Resilient Team for a Broken Nation. With the Taliban in control, what, and whom, is Afghanistan's national soccer team playing for?
* The Fight of This Old Boxer's Life Was With His Own Family. A battle among   Marvin Stein's family over his fortune broke out, and he suddenly found himself powerless to fight for himself. ""I showed up at her office with all the Broadway remedies: Lemon Lozenge from Juice Generation, zinc and ginger."" The sisters aren't sure if they will put down roots in New York City, but for now, it is home. ""I eventually want to have a family and have them grow up the way I did, with the yard and the whole thing,"" Carmen said. ""But right now I want to be close to her."" According to John Logan, a professor of sociology at Brown University: ""Family relationships are the strongest part of most people's social networks. So it makes sense that those who don't already have a family setting in the neighborhood where they live might want to create it. This is what people do all around the world."" Michelle Mandara DeBellis, 34, and Ani Sandoval, 33, are known as ""the sisters"" in the Upper East Side building where they have lived for the past 10 years, before husbands and children were part of the picture. ""I moved into the building first,"" said Mrs. DeBellis, a director of media relations at Golin for Nintendo of America. ""We were in our 20s then. If the walls could talk!""

""We rely on each other,"" said Mrs. Sandoval, a junior interior designer with Jennifer Flanders and Fifty Two Rooms. ""Even for things as silly as one of our husbands is working late and we need coverage"" for child care. The nearness of in-laws ""makes me feel wealthy, having them here for everything,"" said Ani's husband, Dre Sandoval, 34, the senior creative director at ABC News Marketing and Creative. ""Having family built in, family dinners, activities. The ability to just get in a car together and go. Or go to the park. Or have them watch Desi,"" the Sandovals' 19-month-old son. And when scary situations arise -- for example, when the DeBellises' son, Damian, took a tumble off the bed -- they know they can rely on their siblings. ""I was at a work event,"" said Damian's father, Frank DeBellis, 36, a sales representative at Wilson Daniels Wholesale. ""So Dre took him to the E.R. right away. Things like that, you can't put a price on."" The DeBellis family recently welcomed a daughter, Rosie, who is 1 month old. ""The boys, they're like brothers,"" Mrs. Sandoval said. ""Because they share a nanny and are together every day and on the weekends, they almost look out for each other.""

Van C. Tran, an assistant professor of sociology at Columbia University, said: ""At the absence of parents, siblings fill in a much-needed void and are among the few people that we really trust. As family size has become smaller in recent decades, a greater value has been placed on the familial bond."" ""The other reason people value siblings,"" Mr. Tran said, ""is the rise of the 'sharing economy' "" -- services like Airbnb and Uber -- ""which is meant to reduce transactional costs in an era of growing financial insecurity and rising unaffordability. In this context of 'sharing,' many people would rather share with their siblings than with strangers."" This was certainly the case for the husband-and-wife team of Edward and Lien Lin when they opened Bricolage, a Vietnamese gastro pub in Park Slope, Brooklyn. Lien Lin, 35, the restaurant's executive chef, depends on her sister, Kathy Ho, 38, an adjunct professor of law/supervising social worker at Fordham University School of Law, and Kathy's fiance, Sean Mauch, 43, a mathematician, for a great deal of child care. Mrs. Lin and Mr. Lin, 37, a chef and a partner in the restaurant, have a 4-year-old son, Jaxon. ""I really can't imagine how I'd do it without her,"" said Mrs. Lin, who often puts in 16-hour work days, whether making her banh canh noodles with pickles and tofu in a coconut curry sauce, or washing dishes when short on help. Ms. Ho works at Fordham two days a week and Jaxon is enrolled in a preschool with flexible hours; Dr. Mauch often picks him up. Depending on how late her sister is working, Ms. Ho and Dr. Mauch may take Jaxon to their home and put him to bed there.

The arrangement involved some reshuffling. When the Lins moved to New York from California in 2013, Ms. Ho was living on the Lower East Side. The Lins rented a two-bedroom apartment for $3,000 a month in the Boerum Hill section of Brooklyn, specifically because it was on the same subway line as Ms. Ho's apartment, to make drop-offs and pickups of Jaxon that much easier. Then, as the opening of Bricolage drew near, they enticed Ms. Ho and Dr. Mauch to consider Brooklyn. After some deliberation, Ms. Ho gave up her rent-regulated apartment and moved into a two-bedroom apartment in Downtown Brooklyn, also for $3,000 a month. The sisters now reside on the same street, just a five-minute walk from each other. The help has gone both ways, said Ms. Ho, who has been fed by her sister on countless nights as she completes her Ph.D. For the sisters, who are ethnically Chinese refugees from Vietnam, relying on relatives is nothing new. After the family fled to the United States in 1981, ""We grew up in a house with 14 people in there,"" Mrs. Lin said, referring to her childhood home in California. ""Our three aunts lived with us, our grandparents lived with us. While my parents were at work, my grandma would watch us and my aunties were there. We just lived with each other and took care of each other."" John LaMela, an account coordinator with North 6th Agency, and Nick LaMela, a staff auditor at the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, are identical 23-year-old twins. They grew up in upstate Marlboro, N.Y., attended Marist College together, and now share a $2,700-a-month studio apartment in the financial district. Their beds are separated by a bookcase. ""Sometimes I'll run over to his side and just, like, body-slam him,"" John said. "" 'Wake up, wake up! It's Saturday morning!' "" Their sister, Amanda LaMela, 27, a men's wear buyer for Ross Stores, lives six floors up in a $2,900-a-month studio that she shares with a roommate.

The brothers split the rent, but otherwise operate on what they call ""the college barter system."" If one pays for dry cleaning, the other owes him beer. They do not worry about being too close for comfort. ""It's a big enough building that everyone has their own privacy when they want it,"" John said. ""And if we need space from each other, one of us will go upstairs and hang out with Amanda."" The LaMelas are one another's backup. Take the night Amanda went to sleep early and was awakened by what she described as ""an intense creditor knock"" on the door. She texted her roommate, who was out and who promptly texted her brother John. He had not been at home, either, but he was nearby. ""He runs over and sweat is dripping from his face,"" Amanda said, only to discover that the insistent visitor was Nick, who had deviated from their usual secret sibling knock. ""So I know if anything did go down, they'd be here in 30 seconds,"" Amanda said. The LaMelas have a weekly pasta night tradition at Osteria Morini in SoHo, where pasta dishes can be had for $10 on Mondays from 9 p.m. to closing. ""I knew they'd love the idea,"" Amanda said. ""And I don't think anyone else would want to meet me at 9 p.m. I've got these two guys who have the same ideas of carbohydrates that I do. They're not the enemy.""

Aside from the outings, the LaMela siblings rely on one other for moral support. ""Say I had a bad day at work,"" John said. ""Amanda is the first person I call."" Dr. Logan said: ""The sort of social support most young adults need is having someone to talk to, somebody to rely on. That doesn't necessarily require living in the same building, but being in the same town is quite important."" The call of homeownership will soon put the LaMelas under different roofs: Amanda is in contract to buy an apartment a four-minute walk away, and she and her roommate are moving there. But, she said, if that roommate leaves, she would consider rooming with John -- Nick has a serious girlfriend. And maybe one or both of the twins will want to buy a place in her building; she'll be on the lookout. For the DeBellis and Sandoval families, real estate will also spell the end to the sibling setup. The Sandovals will move to Old Greenwich, Conn., this summer after the birth of their second child. Priced out of the city, they recently bought a three-bedroom fixer-upper for $646,000. And even though the DeBellises plan to eventually follow the Sandovals to suburbia, no doubt to a home within a short driving distance, the move marks the end of an era for the sisters. ""The city can be tough,"" Mrs. DeBellis said, tearing up at the thought of the Sandovals' impending move. ""I love the city. But it will be a much different experience without my sister being down the hall.""","Some young New Yorkers are keeping their adult siblings near, creating a happy second phase of family life.",f059a86f-1e26-5d96-9c03-925d460dcc89,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/20/realestate/20COVJP1/20COVJP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7e9140219946b94f5319346e37f7840be85675a8d8601a95655ae247ed790950&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ana Villafañe, left, who stars in the Broadway musical ""On Your Feet!,"" lives within easy reach of her sister, Carmen Villafañe.",f059a86f-1e26-5d96-9c03-925d460dcc89,N24News/imgs/f059a86f-1e26-5d96-9c03-925d460dcc89.jpg,7
Real Estate,"For Some Brokers, 2011 Was Tops",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/15/realestate/in-the-region-westchester-for-some-brokers-2011-was-tops.html,"SINGLE-FAMILY home sales in Westchester were down about 4.5 percent in 2011 from the year before, and dollar volume was off about 6 percent -- partly the result of the downward trend of house prices, said P. Gilbert Mercurio, who recently retired as chief executive of the Westchester-Putnam Board of Realtors. Yet despite this and other discouraging news from Westchester's housing market, 2011 was not a bad year for everyone. Several brokerages reported banner years -- among them McClellan Sotheby's International Realty in Pelham; Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty in White Plains; Houlihan Lawrence, based in Bronxville; and Keller Williams NY Realty in White Plains and Bedford. Also, some agents racked up more sales in 2011 than before the housing market imploded several years ago. Westchester's top-producing agent, Nancy Kennedy of Houlihan Lawrence, logged upward of $60 million in sales last year, more than when the market was at its peak five years ago.

Houlihan Lawrence, which has offices in several counties with 15 of Westchester's 20 top-producing sales agents, captured 34 percent of the total dollar volume in the county -- $2.6 billion -- in 2011, similar to 2010. In 2009, it captured 30 percent. For most, however, the market barely lumbered along. Many agents dropped out of the field altogether. As a result of the hard times, membership in the Westchester-Putnam Board of Realtors fell in recent years to 6,700 from 8,000 -- a decline that prompted its merger on Jan. 1 with counterpart groups in Rockland and Orange. Similarly, some agencies were absorbed by larger ones, notably Nelson Vrooman GMAC Real Estate in White Plains, which was acquired by Better Homes and Gardens Rand. Those who thrived in 2011 attributed their success to a combination of variables, including an aggressive response to a recalcitrant market -- specifically, increased advertising and greater reliance on the Internet and technology. Another factor was New York City's strengthened market, which allowed more property owners to sell their condominiums and cooperatives there and move north.

In Pelham, 29 miles from Manhattan by Metro-North -- dollar volume increased, said Sona Davidian, an owner of McClellan Sotheby's. The tally for all sales in town was $166 million in 2011, up from $147 million in 2010. According to Ms. Davidian, McClellan Sotheby's made $82 million of that amount; in 2010, it took in $64 million. The agency sold just three more houses in 2011 than in 2010, but of the total, more were on the expensive end. Gary Leogrande, the principal of Keller Williams NY Realty, took a different tack. Whereas other agencies shied away from foreclosures and short sales, he said his agency embraced them, becoming a specialist in the field. ""Five years ago most of the transactions we completed were normal, not distressed, sales,"" said Mr. Leogrande, the president of the Empire Access Multiple Listing Service. ""Now 15 percent of our business is short sales and and/or bank-owned properties, and it's paid off for us."" Mr. Leogrande's brokerage logged more than $100 million in Westchester sales last year, exceeding the previous year's levels, he said -- although he declined to reveal the numbers for 2010. To beat the odds in an ailing market, agencies like Better Homes and Gardens Rand Realty went on the offensive by acquiring smaller, struggling agencies, said J. P. Endres, the office manager for Rand in White Plains. ""While others were closing, we expanded,"" said Ms. Endres, who is also the secretary-treasurer of the New York State Association of Realtors. ""Some people get paralyzed in a market like this one. Others forge ahead.""

In addition to Nelson Vrooman, her agency acquired the Gorbutt Group, an independent firm in White Plains, and Century 21 Wolff, which had several offices in the county. It also opened offices in Larchmont, Scarsdale and Somers, going toe-to-toe with agencies well established in those towns. Better Homes and Gardens Rand, which has offices in Putnam, Orange, Rockland and Dutchess Counties, has also begun expanding into northern New Jersey and is now eyeing Connecticut, Ms. Endres said. She also said its White Plains office alone completed $100 million in sales in 2011, up from $56 million in 2007. ""The key is how you handle yourself in an adverse market,"" she said. ""In flush times, like 2005, anybody can sell a house; in tough times, it's another story."" Ms. Kennedy of Houlihan Lawrence, which had 15 of the county's top-producing brokers, proved that point. Her year was ""one of the best years I've ever had,"" she said. One tactic adopted by Ms. Kennedy -- who works out of Houlihan's Croton office, and who has just assumed the presidency of the Hudson Gateway Association of Realtors, the newly merged trade group -- was to jettison the adage that all real estate is local. ""As the market became more challenging,"" she said, ""I expanded my territory. You can't afford to specialize anymore in a specific territory, or for that matter, even limit yourself to a specific price range. ""In past years, buyers moved on to another broker if they weren't able to find a house in your area,"" she said, adding that the new rule in a changed market is to ""stay with a client wherever they go, until they find the house of their dreams and the deal is done.""","Several Westchester County brokerages reported a banner year, racking up greater dollar volume in 2011 than in recent years.",45ce8b0c-ba09-5b95-9e46-f5b2f2b1f9e2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/01/15/realestate/15WEZONE_SPAN/we-zone-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=360&w=600&s=5b6b69795afc264bb3b7096f56f865ed212c216f9927eebe2cb5f0e6dec614c8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Nancy Kennedy, a broker with Houlihan Lawrence, at a house that she is showing in Croton-on-Hudson.

Health,Michigan Case Adds U.S. Dimension to Debate on Genital Mutilation,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/10/health/genital-mutilation-muslim-dawoodi-bohra-michigan-case.html,"As more details emerge about the first-ever charges of female genital mutilation in the United States, the case is opening a window onto a small immigrant community, while stirring impassioned discussion about genital cutting among women who have experienced it. At a hearing in Michigan this past week, a federal prosecutor said the defendants -- two doctors and a clinic manager from a small Shiite Muslim sect -- were believed to have arranged cutting for up to 100 girls since 2005. The prosecutor, Sara Woodward, said investigators had so far identified eight girls. The unprecedented charges provide an unusual case study of a practice outlawed in the United States two decades ago but still seen in parts of Africa, the Middle East and, less frequently, South Asia. The focus on the Dawoodi Bohra, a sect of about 1.2 million based in western India, with clusters in the United States, Pakistan and elsewhere, is spurring Bohra women to describe their experiences publicly. Some are doing so for the first time, defying the sect's historic secrecy about cutting and taking a risk that they or relatives will be ostracized. ""This Michigan case made me think I want to speak out,"" said Nazia Mirza, 34, who was cut at age 6 in her hometown, Houston. ""To me it's very much like a rape survivor. If you don't say anything, then how are you going to expose it and bring awareness?""

The case prompted Tasneem Raja, 34, a journalist, to write about being cut in New Jersey. She said she had received ""an outpouring of emails from people saying thank you."" But Ms. Raja said the case was exposing a spectrum of feelings. Even among Bohra women who oppose cutting, she said, views range from ""women who say this has greatly impacted their sex life and their ability to enjoy sex, to people like me who walked away with lifelong emotional trauma, to people who say, 'I don't see what the big deal is.'"" Some worry the case is stoking anti-Muslim sentiment, though cutting is not in the Quran or practiced in many Muslim societies. And some Bohras who oppose cutting nonetheless feel the defendants are being unfairly demonized for a practice endorsed by their religion's leadership. ""I don't want to be pro the practice, but I don't want it to be exaggerated into something completely barbaric,"" said Maryah Haidery, 37, who comes from a Bohra family in New Jersey and had never spoken publicly about her cutting before. Ms. Haidery, who does medical writing for pharmaceutical companies, said she was ""very concerned about this violation"" in Michigan, but also ""taken aback by how vilified that Michigan doctor had become.""

Prosecutors, citing phone records, texts, interviews and surveillance video, accuse Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, an emergency medicine physician, of cutting the genitals of two 7-year-old girls from Minnesota. Dr. Fakhruddin Attar, an internist, is accused of letting Dr. Nagarwala use his Burhani Medical Clinic in Livonia. His wife, Farida Attar, the clinic's office manager, is accused of holding the girls' hands during the Feb. 3 procedures and urging others to deceive investigators. According to a criminal complaint, one of the Minnesota girls told investigators that it was a ""special girls' trip"" for a procedure ""to get the germs out."" A medical examination showed that the girl's labia minora had been ""altered or removed,"" that the clitoral hood was ""abnormal in appearance"" and that she had scar tissue and small lacerations. The other girl said that she ""'got a shot' and it hurt really badly and she screamed,"" and that ""after the procedure, she could barely walk, and she felt pain all the way down to her ankle,"" the complaint said. An examination found a small incision in her clitoral hood and a small tear to her labia minora. Dr. Attar said Dr. Nagarwala occasionally used his clinic to see 6- to 9-year-old Bohra girls for ""problems with their genitals, including treatment of genital rashes,"" the complaint said. The Minnesota girls' parents have not been charged. At least one girl was briefly removed from her parents' custody. Michigan's Child Protective Services has initiated petitions to terminate custodial rights of several Bohra parents whose daughters are believed to have undergone cutting, including Dr. Nagarwala's 12-year-old daughter and the Attars' 8-year-old daughter. The Attars were released on bond, confined to house arrest; Dr. Nagarwala remained in prison. Michigan's Dawoodi Bohra mosque, Anjuman-e-Najmi, where the defendants worship, said in a statement after the arrests that ""any violation of U.S. law is counter to instructions to our community members"" and ""does not reflect the everyday lives of the Dawoodi Bohras in America.""

Dr. Nagarwala, 44, who was born in America, received her medical degree from Johns Hopkins and worked at Henry Ford Health System, which fired her after the arrest and said no cutting had occurred at its facilities. Her lawyer, Shannon Smith, said Dr. Nagarwala acknowledged ""removing a sesame seed-sized amount of mucous membrane"" from the clitoral hood. ""What she did does not meet the definition of female genital mutilation,"" Ms. Smith said, calling it ""a ritual nick"" and ""a protected religious procedure."" Dr. Attar's lawyer, Mary Chartier, said her client was at a bookstore when prosecutors claim he met Dr. Nagarwala at the clinic. But she said ""he knew that this century-old religious rite of passage was being conducted at his clinic"" and believed ""it wasn't female genital mutilation."" It is unclear how common cutting is in the United States. In 1996, genital mutilation of girls was banned, and in 2013, so was traveling outside the United States for cutting. The World Health Organization considers all forms of cutting to be human rights violations.

The practice varies by culture and can include narrowing the vaginal opening and sewing it virtually closed, removing the clitoris or labia, or cutting, piercing, burning or scraping the clitoral hood. Dawoodi Bohra's form of it, sometimes called khatna, typically involves the clitoral hood. But all types can vary depending on tradition and whether the practitioner has medical training. Lawyers for the Michigan defendants argue that their clients' practice is milder than male circumcision. ""With what my client was doing,"" Ms. Smith said, ""we're talking removal of the mucous membrane, and the girls are walking out the door 10 minutes later just fine."" But while male circumcision has opponents, it is legal, and some medical experts link it to health advantages. In contrast, the cutting of female genitalia can cause serious difficulty or pain during sex, pregnancy or childbirth. ""Health providers know the harms and the short-term and long-term complications,"" said Dr. Nawal Nour, director of the African Women's Health Center at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, who is experienced in treating such patients. For the Dawoodi Bohra sect, which encourages education, particularly on a path toward medical and engineering professions, cutting increasingly generates debate. In 2015, three Bohras in Australia were convicted of performing cutting. Afterward, leaders in India circulated letters to mosques worldwide, saying Bohras should follow laws of the countries where they live. Later, however, several Bohra women recalled, the highest Bohra leader gave a speech saying Bohra traditions should continue despite Western opposition.

Khatna, like many cutting traditions, is performed by women; men often say they are unaware of its occurrence. Justifications for it vary, including to curb sexual promiscuity, preserve tradition or, said Ms. Raja, ""take a bad bug or a germ out of you."" Ms. Mirza mostly remembers ""a woman holding me -- I was screaming."" Married with two children, Ms. Mirza, who left the sect, said cutting had ""totally affected me in terms of my intimacy and struggling to feel pleasure."" Ms. Haidery's experience is complex. Cut by a relative with medical training using an anesthetic, she remembers little pain, saying she was told that ""I had to do this in order to be fit to be married."" When an obstetrician examining her during pregnancy noticed nothing unusual, ""I thought maybe it's not a huge deal,"" she said. Still, she said that ""I was shocked"" when Bohra friends in New Jersey mentioned getting their daughters cut and was ""very happy that I didn't have a girl."" Mariya Taher, a co-founder of a Bohra anti-cutting group, Sahiyo, which conducted a 2015 survey of Bohra women, said some Bohras considered cutting a ""social norm"" and ""if you don't get it done you're doing something wrong and you're not helping your daughter out."" But more women now consider it ""gender violence,"" especially serious because ""it's happening to little girls,"" she said. ""You're tampering with female genitalia,"" Ms. Mirza said. ""It violates you as a human being and it shouldn't be done, end of story.""","The first-ever charges in America call attention to the practices of a small Muslim sect, and have women coming forward to describe their experiences.",e1e96597-1e38-5f48-a696-64502c72b756,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/10/science/10CUTTING1/10CUTTING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f3a4fad0667e49443dcbfa730532557ba6181f40c7564f86c231b2ce496c5a6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nazia Mirza of Texas is a member of the Dawoodi Bohra religious sect, which has a long tradition of cutting girls' genitalia.

Automobiles,"In Some Classes, Buyers Are Not Ready to Give Up Their V-8s",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/15/automobiles/15LUXO.html,"CARS around the world are making do with fewer cylinders to save fuel; the engine of the Tata Nano, to cite one extreme case, has just two.

Yet this is America, land of cheap gasoline and home of the brave V-8, a country where 4-cylinder engines have mainly populated rental fleets and econocars. So the question nags: how low are we willing to go in the cylinder count, especially for models that stake their images on power and prestige?

Ford has already made waves with the announcement that its EcoBoost 4-cylinder will be available in the redesigned Explorer. But cowboys, urban and otherwise, might swallow their Skoal if they see 4-cylinder engines in a new, smaller pickup that carries an F-Series badge, an idea that Ford has said it is considering.

Chevrolet has tested a turbo 4 in its muscle-car Camaro.

Media,The Atlantic Retracts Ruth Shalit Barrett Article on Niche Sports,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/01/business/media/atlantic-ruth-shalit-barrett.html,"""I never imagined an outcome like this,"" the writer Ruth Shalit Barrett said of The Atlantic article. ""And I'm so very sorry that this is where things have ended up.""





The Atlantic on Sunday took the extraordinary step of retracting an article by Ruth Shalit Barrett, who was a rising young political reporter in the 1990s when accusations of plagiarism derailed her career as an associate editor at The New Republic. ""We cannot attest to the trustworthiness and credibility of the author, and therefore we cannot attest to the veracity of the article,"" The Atlantic said in an editor's note that it updated on Sunday night. The buzzy article, which was published online last month and appears in the magazine's November print edition, chronicles a world of wealthy parents in the Connecticut suburbs obsessed with prodding their children into niche sports like fencing, crew and squash in hopes of getting them into Ivy League schools. In the editor's note, The Atlantic said that its fact-checking department had thoroughly rechecked the article, which was more than 6,000 words, speaking with more than 40 sources and independently corroborating information.

""But we now know that the author misled our fact-checkers, lied to our editors, and is accused of inducing at least one source to lie to our fact-checking department,"" the note said. ""We believe that these actions fatally undermined the effectiveness of the fact-checking process. It is impossible for us to vouch for the accuracy of this article. This is what necessitates a full retraction. We apologize to our readers."" The Atlantic said it had decided to take down the online version, but to make available a PDF of the article as it appears in the print edition, as a way to preserve the ""historical record."" The retraction came after a nearly 800-word editor's note was appended to the article on Friday suggesting that Ms. Barrett had deceived the publication. The deception, according to the editor's note, centered on a woman featured in the article who was identified by her middle name, Sloane. She was described as a stay-at-home mother with three daughters and a son, details that The Atlantic's fact-checking department said it had verified with the mother before publication. But Sloane later acknowledged through her lawyer that she does not have a son, according to the editor's note, which said it had investigated the issue after questions were raised by a Washington Post media critic, Erik Wemple.

According to the editor's note, Sloane's lawyer said Ms. Barrett had ""first proposed the invention of a son, and encouraged Sloane to deceive The Atlantic as a way to protect her anonymity.""

""When we asked Barrett about these allegations, she initially denied them, saying that Sloane had told her she had a son, and that she had believed Sloane,"" the editor's note said. ""The next day, when we questioned her again, she admitted that she was 'complicit' in 'compounding the deception' and that 'it would not be fair to Sloane' to blame her alone for deceiving The Atlantic."" The editor's note said that although Ms. Barrett had denied that the invention of a son was her idea, she had acknowledged that ""'on some level I did know that it was BS' and 'I do take responsibility.'"" Ms. Barrett had been an up-and-coming young reporter with a contract at GQ magazine before she was accused of plagiarism at The New Republic. Those accusations, in 1994 and 1995, were based on a close resemblance between passages and sentences in articles Ms. Barrett wrote and material in articles by other reporters on the same subjects. At the time, she said she had confused her typewritten notes with articles downloaded from the research site Lexis-Nexis. The New Republic printed apologies for both incidents. Ms. Barrett was also criticized for a 1995 cover article in The New Republic that described The Washington Post's quest for diversity on its staff as having diminished the quality of its coverage. The article drew angry denunciations by The Post's editor and publisher and attacks that she was a careless reporter. Ms. Barrett left The New Republic in 1999 and took a job in advertising. In a 1999 interview with The Washington City Paper, she described her meteoric rise and fall in journalism: ""I was 23 years old, I was writing New Republic pieces, I was writing cover stories for The New York Times Magazine, I was filing columns for GQ, and at the same time, I was bopping around and being a 23-year-old and buying miniskirts with my GQ money. And yes, I loved it, but guess what? One false move and it all came tumbling down.""

Since the 1990s, she has written occasionally for various publications. Columns she wrote when she worked in advertising appeared in Salon from 1999 to 2001. She also wrote for New York magazine's Vulture in 2018, and for Elle magazine in 2015, when she profiled the actor Jamie Dornan from the movie ""Fifty Shades of Grey,"" according to her website. The Atlantic said it had assigned her the sports article as a freelancer because more than two decades had passed since those incidents and because her work had appeared in reputable magazines in recent years. The editor's note said The Atlantic also considered the argument that Ms. Barrett deserved a second chance. ""We were wrong to make this assignment, however,"" the editor's note said. ""It reflects poor judgment on our part, and we regret our decision."" Her byline in The Atlantic might not have immediately resonated with readers because she was using her married name, Ruth S. Barrett, and not Ruth Shalit, which was her byline when the prior incidents occurred. In its editor's note, The Atlantic said it had updated the byline to Ruth Shalit Barrett ""in the interest of transparency."" In an email on Sunday night, Ms. Barrett said the reference to a son had been inserted at Sloane's request late in the editing process. ""It was a serious error and misjudgment on my part to allow Sloane to claim this son, but my intentions were honorable -- to allow an agitated source who was fearful of being identified to protect her anonymity,"" she said. ""Every other fact about Sloane is correct and verifiable through public records and competitive squash and fencing tournament websites.""",Ms. Barrett had been a rising young political reporter in the 1990s before accusations of plagiarism derailed her career as an associate editor at The New Republic.,2399fac3-e881-544e-8ea2-9c9f065a3dc3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/02/business/media/01xp-atlantic-print/01xp-atlantic01-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1dc8c42bb2efd93de8b45803ee8f4693322711a7fee17895d861b76a8fd6bca0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;I never imagined an outcome like this,&rdquo; the writer Ruth Shalit Barrett said of The Atlantic article. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;m so very sorry that this is where things have ended up.&rdquo;",2399fac3-e881-544e-8ea2-9c9f065a3dc3,N24News/imgs/2399fac3-e881-544e-8ea2-9c9f065a3dc3.jpg,16
Sports,Former Head of XFL Sues Its Controlling Owner,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/21/sports/football/xfl-oliver-luck-vince-mcmahon-sued.html,"The former commissioner of the XFL recently filed a wrongful-termination lawsuit in federal court against the football league's controlling owner, Vince McMahon, three days after the short-lived sports venture filed for bankruptcy.

The lawsuit, filed by Oliver Luck last Thursday in U.S. District Court in Connecticut, contends that McMahon breached the terms of Luck's contract when McMahon's company, Alpha Entertainment, fired him on April 9.

McMahon, a wrestling mogul and the face of the WWE brand, has twice dabbled in trying to build an alternative to the National Football League in the past 20 years -- both times with lackluster results. The previous incarnation of the league, which this time had eight teams and sought to differentiate itself from the N.F.L. with rules changes, was also called the XFL.

Luck's dismissal came one day before the XFL suspended its operations and laid off its staff, its season disrupted by the coronavirus pandemic that has forced the cancellation of sporting events worldwide. The XFL had played five weeks of its season.","The former commissioner said the football league, which filed for bankruptcy, breached the terms of his contract.",39672180-f4da-5e6d-93a3-3ead9476bc77,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/21/sports/21xp-virus-xflsuit/21xp-virus-xflsuit-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=dd4c61ab1078c5d8f452f026ccdb0f6245928b157fbb29dac6513efe2404f1b4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Oliver Luck, the XFL commissioner, was dismissed one day before the league suspended operations.",39672180-f4da-5e6d-93a3-3ead9476bc77,N24News/imgs/39672180-f4da-5e6d-93a3-3ead9476bc77.jpg,9
Style,Do Plants Have Something to Say?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/26/style/can-plants-talk.html,"Monica Gagliano says that she has received Yoda-like advice from trees and shrubbery. She recalls being rocked like a baby by the spirit of a fern. She has ridden on the back of an invisible bear conjured by an osha root. She once accidentally bent space and time while playing the ocarina, an ancient wind instrument, in a redwood forest. ""Oryngham,"" she says, means ""thank you"" in plant language. These interactions have taken place in dreams, visions, songs and telekinetic interactions, sometimes with the help of shamans or ayahuasca. This has all gone on around the same time as Dr. Gagliano's scientific research, which has broken boundaries in the field of plant behavior and signaling. Currently at the University of Sydney in Australia, she has published a number of studies that support the view that plants are, to some extent, intelligent. Her experiments suggest that they can learn behaviors and remember them. Her work also suggests that plants can ""hear"" running water and even produce clicking noises, perhaps to communicate. Plants have directly shaped her experiments and career path. In 2012, she says, an oak tree assured her that a risky grant application -- proposing research on sound communication in plants -- would be successful. ""You are here to tell our stories,"" the tree told her. ""These experiences are not like, 'Oh you're a weirdo, this is happening just to you,'"" Dr. Gagliano said. Learning from plants, she said, is a long-documented ceremonial practice (if not one typically endorsed by scientists).

""This is part of the repertoire of human experiences,"" she said. ""We've been doing this forever and ever, and are still doing this."" Dr. Gagliano knows that these claims, based on subjective experiences and not scientific evidence, can easily be read as delusional. She also knows that this could damage her scientific career -- plant scientists in particular really hate this sort of thing. Back in 1973, an explosively popular book, ""The Secret Life of Plants,"" made pseudoscientific claims about plants, including that they enjoy classical music and can read human minds. The book was firmly discredited, but the maelstrom made many institutions and researchers reasonably wary of bold statements about botanical aptitude. Regardless, last year Dr. Gagliano published a heady and meandering memoir about the conversations with plants that inspired her peer-reviewed work, titled ""Thus Spoke the Plant."" She believes, like many scientists and environmentalists do, that in order to save the planet we have to understand ourselves as part of the natural world. It's just that she also believes the plants themselves can speak to this point. ""I want people to realize that the world is full of magic, but not as something only some people can do, or something that is outside of this world,"" she said. ""No, it's all here.""

Language, for example, doesn't seem to be limited to humans. Prairie dogs use adjectives (lots of them) and Alston's singing mice, a species found in Central America, chirp ""politely."" Ravens have demonstrated advanced planning, another blow to human exceptionalism, by bartering for food and selecting the best tools for future use. The list goes on. Leaf-cutter ants not only invented farming a couple million years before we did, but they have their own landfills -- and garbagemen. Even slime molds can be said to make ""decisions,"" and are so good at determining the most efficient route between resources that researchers have suggested we use them to help design highways. But it may be plants whose capacities are the most head-rattling, if only because we tend to view them as decor. Plants can do a lot of things we can't. Trees can clone themselves into 80,000-year-old superorganisms. Corn can summon wasps to attack caterpillars. But research suggests we also have some things in common. Plants share nutrients and recognize kin. They communicate with each other. They can count. They can feel you touching them. So we know that plants respond to their environments in sophisticated, complex ways -- ""far more complex than most of us realized a few years ago,"" said Ted Farmer, a botanist at University of Lausanne in Switzerland and one of the first to defend the concept of inter-plant communication. Dr. Farmer is among those still ""very"" uncomfortable describing plants, which lack neurons, as ""intelligent."" But now it's ""consciousness"" -- another word without a firm definition -- that's really raising hackles in the scientific community.

A group of biologists published a paper this summer with the matter-of-fact title ""Plants Neither Possess nor Require Consciousness."" The authors warned against anthropomorphism, and argued that proponents of plant consciousness have ""consistently glossed over"" the unique capacities of the brain. Though her book went unremarked upon, Dr. Gagliano's experiments and statements ascribing feelings and subjectivity to plants were among those critiqued, and she was categorized witheringly within ""a new wave of Romantic biology."" Versions of this debate have been simmering for years. In 2013, Michael Pollan wrote about Dr. Gagliano presenting the results of an experiment to an incredulous audience. That study is likely her most widely known. In it, she sought to discover whether plants, like animals, could demonstrate a basic type of learning called ""habituation."" The Mimosa pudica -- you may know it as the ""sensitive plant"" -- contracts its leaves when touched. So, in the experiment, potted mimosas were dropped a few harmless inches onto foam. At first, the leaves closed up immediately. But over time, they stopped reacting. It wasn't that they were fatigued, Dr. Gagliano wrote, because, when the pots were shaken, the leaves closed up again. And when the dropping test was repeated a month later, their leaves remained unruffled. The plants had ""learned"" that the drop wasn't a threat, Dr. Gagliano argued. The plants remembered. And subsequent research has suggested that plants may indeed be capable of some type of memory. But Dr. Gagliano's conclusion didn't go over well at the time. Her framing of the data didn't help. She insists that she doesn't use metaphors in her work, and that ""learning"" is the best description we have for what took place, even if we don't know how the plants are doing it.

To communicate with plants, Dr. Gagliano followed the dieta, or the shamanic method in the indigenous Amazonian tradition by which a human establishes a dialogue with a plant. The rules can vary, but it usually involves following a diet (no salt, alcohol, sugar or sex; some animal products may also be prohibited, depending on the culture) and drinking a plant concoction (sometimes hallucinogenic, sometimes not) in isolation for days, weeks or months. An icaro, or medicine song, is said to be shared by the plant, as well as visions and dreams, and the plant's healing knowledge becomes a part of the human. It's not fun, she warned. Dr. Gagliano worked with multiple plant shamans, or vegetalistas, in Peru. There she bathed in the foul-smelling pulp of an Ayahuma tree, which then designed a scientific experiment for her, instructing her to ""train young plants in a maze and give them freedom of choice."" The Ayahuma also helped her diagram a 2017 study investigating pea plants' use of sound to detect water.

In the memoir, she wrote that she also traveled to California to work with a health care professional who conducts vision quest ceremonies (that's when the oak tree spoke to her). She visited ""the Diviner,"" a man trained by the Dagara people of Ghana and Burkina Faso to channel nature spirits. At a certain point, Dr. Gagliano began going solo, ""working with"" plants like basil in her own veggie patch. ""Did you ever wonder if you were going insane?"" I asked. ""Absolutely,"" she said, and laughed. ""I still do."" But she believes she should be free to talk openly about these experiences. ""Maybe we should admit that we hardly understand who we are, we hardly understand where we are at, we know very little compared to what there is to know,"" she said. ""To be open to explore and learn, I think that is the sign of wisdom, not of madness. And maybe wisdom and madness do look very similar, at some point.""

But Dr. Gagliano's journey, her supporters say, is rooted in a desire to challenge dominant assumptions. ""I have been working with the idea of plant intelligence for many years,"" said Luis Eduardo Luna, an anthropologist and ayahuasca researcher in Brazil who has collaborated with Dr. Gagliano. Back in 1984, he published a paper in the Journal of Ethnopharmacology detailing the concept of plants as teachers in the Peruvian Amazon. Dr. Luna said he was excited to hear these ideas expressed by a scientist, rather than someone in the humanities. ""Perhaps we are living in a much more interesting universe, perhaps we are living in a planet full of intelligent life,"" Dr. Luna said. ""I think it's very important that we recover, somehow, this idea of the sacrality of nature, in the terrible situation in which we are today."" ""I'm really interested in the notion of plants as teachers, what we can learn from them as models,"" said Robin Wall Kimmerer, an author, botanist and SUNY professor, and a member of the Citizen Potawatomi Nation. ""And that comes from my work with indigenous knowledge, because that is a fundamental assumption of indigenous environmental philosophy."" Dr. Kimmerer doesn't see Dr. Gagliano's experiences as mystical processes so much as poorly understood ones.

Given this context, it's logical that critique over her approach hasn't stopped Dr. Gagliano from finding an audience. She spoke about plant intelligence at last year's Bioneers Conference, and was invited to speak at last year's Science and Nonduality conference, along with Deepak Chopra and Paul Stamets, a respected mycologist who believes that mushrooms are trying to communicate with humans through their hallucinogenic properties. This summer, Dr. Gagliano sat on a sold-out panel called ""Intelligence Without Brains"" at the World Science Festival. There I eavesdropped on a woman excitedly explaining Mr. Pollan's recent book on psychedelic therapy to her mom. Why had they come? ""We're plant ladies!"" said one, beaming. ""There's a lot about plants that we don't know that might end up saving us, in some regard."" Dr. Gagliano spoke about plants with pointed familiarity. In her telling, they became jaunty little characters; she used pronouns like ""he"" and ""they"" -- never ""it."" At the festival, a young woman asked Dr. Gagliano how her scientific work had changed her understanding of the world. ""The main difference is that I used to live in a world of objects, and now I live in a world of subjects,"" she said. There were murmurs of approval. ""And so, I am never alone.""",One scientist is definitely listening.,951da417-17f9-5c1b-80a7-a894149fc371,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/05/fashion/05plantlife-1/05plantlife-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bfa0637a4a6f7bcf897bd86ae8398062fb1479bb01b2ad540f67b65d0c1c560b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Monica Gagliano, all ears in Central Park.",951da417-17f9-5c1b-80a7-a894149fc371,N24News/imgs/951da417-17f9-5c1b-80a7-a894149fc371.jpg,15
Art & Design,A Bumpy Journey From Havana to New York Ends at 'Wild Noise/Ruido Salvaje',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/arts/design/a-bumpy-journey-from-havana-to-new-york-ends-at-wild-noise-ruido-salvaje.html,"Storm clouds have piled up around ""Wild Noise/Ruido Salvaje,"" an exhibition of contemporary Cuban work at the Bronx Museum of the Arts. The show was planned a few years ago as a two-part mutual exchange of permanent collection work between the Bronx Museum and the National Museum of Fine Arts in Havana. In May 2015, the Bronx material, a juicy globalist grab bag, made the trip to Cuba without a hitch and returned home safely. The prearranged shipment of Cuban art from the National Museum to New York, however, hit a roadblock when, according to the Bronx Museum, Cuban authorities refused to let any of it leave the island. Whatever the full story of that setback, the Bronx Museum moved ahead with a make-do version of the project. Working with two National Museum curators, Corina Matamoros and Aylet Ojeda Jequin, it patched together the present show from its own holdings and American loans. And even then there were problems.

One scheduled artist in the Bronx Museum's collection, Tania Bruguera, was under government house arrest in Cuba in May 2015 and not included in the Bronx show there, though she could and should have been. She recently backed out of the New York leg of ""Wild Noise,"" protesting the museum's failure to speak out critically to the Cuban government. (The museum, for its part, harbors hopes that a Cuba-to-New-York exchange will at some point come off.)

There's no question that the exhibition as it will finally open here is a far less challenging affair than Ms. Bruguera would have wished. Although it claims to be ""an exploration of contemporary Cuban art from the 1970s to the present,"" it is in no way a representative survey. Like the Bronx collection display in Havana, it's a sedate sampler, one without a shaping point of view. Wild and noisy are exactly what it is not. This is disappointing. At the same time, the show doesn't lack for political content; there's plenty, however discreetly framed. And there are advantages to having no ironbound curatorial concept in play: At least the 30 or so artists get equal time with their varied voices, some mild, some strong, several new to New York.

Still, some thematic structuring would have been a help, even at the risk of reinforcing stereotypes of tropical exoticism, revolutionary fervor, etc. One obvious theme is the presence of nature, a universally loaded one in the age of climate crisis. It's everywhere here. The performance artist Glenda Leon notates music and dance scores with images of raindrops. The Cuban-American conceptualist Maria Elena Gonzalez punches holes in photographs of palm trees. Humberto Diaz, currently an artist-in-residence at the Bronx Museum, extends the active life of fallen tree branches he scavenges from the city's parks by attaching industrial brooms to their tips. For a long-unseen installation from the early 1990s, the artist Alexis Leiva Machado, known as Kcho, transforms a set of palm saplings into what look like giant oars, a reminder of earlier waves of exodus from the island by boat to escape political persecution.

The Cuban-born Ana Mendieta (1948-1985) was part of that refugee generation and came to the United States as a child. Her attachment to Cuba remained profound, often expressed as an intimate, sacrificial identification with the natural world. In a series of works called ""Siluetas,"" she virtually merged with it, buried herself, by tracing and burning the shape of her body into the earth, as documented in a dozen photographs from her art school years at the University of Iowa in the 1970s. ""Silueta Works in Iowa (Tree and Fire, Old Man's Creek),"" from 1976-78, by Ana Mendieta. In such images, Ms. Mendieta was indirectly referring to a specific aspect of Cuban cultural history: the forced mass migration that was the Atlantic slave trade. Beginning in the 16th century, hundreds of thousands of slaves were shipped from Africa to Spanish colonial Cuba to work on sugar plantations, bringing their languages, arts and spiritual lives with them. The spirit of Afro-Caribbean religions that developed on the island was central to much of Ms. Mendieta's work, and to that of several other artists in the show. In the 1980s, Jose Bedia became a priest of Palo Monte, a religion with roots in the Kongo kingdom of Central Africa, home to many New World slaves. Belkis Ayon, who took her own life in Havana in 1999 at age 32, was inspired by Abakua, an all-male, Nigerian-derived secret society that she, heretically, infuses with female energy in a magnificent body of black-and-white figurative prints. These hybrid faiths, and others, are still widely practiced. And skin color continues to be, even in a country that once made utopian claims to colorblindness, a social and economic determinant. This is a reality that the artist Maria Magdalena Campos-Pons has been addressing for years in ritualistic whiteface performances -- one took place, unannounced, in Piazza San Marco during the 2013 Venice Biennale -- and in role-playing photographic self-portraits, like the ones in the show.

Ezequiel Suarez, who with the artist Sandra Ceballos founded Havana's oldest alternative space, Espacio Aglutinador, was hounded by censors in the 1990s. In response, he took to writing secret, tweet-size messages to Castro on the reverse side of his abstract embroideries, literally hiding subversive content in his art. 4 Other Names to Know in Latin American Art Paving the way. Frida Kahlo is internationally renowned for the emotional intensity of her work. But she is not the only woman from Latin America to leave her mark in the art world. Here are four more to know: 1. Luchita Hurtado. For years, Hurtado worked in the shadow of her husbands and more famous peers. Her paintings, which emphasize the interconnectedness of all living things, didn't get recognition from the art world until late in her life. 2. Belkis Ayon. A Cuban printmaker, Ayon was a master in the art of collagraphy. She worked almost exclusively in black, white and gray. She used her art, focused on a secret religious fraternity, to explore the themes of humanity and spirituality. 3. Ana Mendieta. Mendieta's art was sometimes violent, often unapologetically feminist and usually raw. She incorporated natural materials like blood, dirt, water and fire, and displayed her work through photography, film and live performances. 4. Remedios Varo. Though she was born in Spain, Varo's work is indelibly linked to Mexico, where she immigrated during World War II. Her style is reminiscent of Renaissance art in its exquisite precision, but her dreamlike paintings were otherworldly in tone. For decades, to the outside world, Cuban art meant propaganda. Portraits of Castro and Che Guevara were best sellers because that's all that was on the market. The curators of ""Wild Noise"" put an antic spin on this phenomenon, without abandoning it. But they also include some genuinely moving political work. In 1996, Mr. Toirac and Ms. Marrero did a series of 12 portraits, from news photos, of corpses found in a city morgue after the Cuban president, Fulgencio Batista, had been overthrown by the Revolution in 1959. Who these people were, and why and how they died, is unrecorded. The military has memorials to unknown soldiers; these are unknown citizens. The artists treat them with reverence, painting their features with wine and gold leaf.

They take a refined, even delicate approach to a large subject. There are other examples. Diana Fonseca Quinones distills the texture of a crumbling Havana in small abstract collages made of paint scraps harvested from building exteriors. Pedro Pablo Oliva portrays Jose Marti, the apostle of Cuban independence, as a slumbering saint in dapper tropical whites. And the conceptualist Wilfredo Prieto sketches, in the faintest of ink lines on a long paper scroll, images of every project he has completed in a prolific career. In the end, Ms. Bruguera's resistance to a show that she found to be too unprotestingly in line with the Cuban government's dictatorial control of art is well taken. And this leads to a natural question: If work from the permanent collection of the National Museum in Havana had traveled, would it be any more radical than what we see here? In short, ""Wild Noise"" maybe as good as we could expect considering the official sources and compromises involved. We may find a bolder take on truth-in-history in a larger show, ""Adios Utopia: Dreams and Deceptions in Cuban Art Since 1950,"" which opens at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, on March 5. In terms of point of view, the title alone speaks volumes.","Although it claims to explore contemporary art in Cuba from the 1970s on, this show isn't a representative survey.

Media,PBS Is Creating a Channel Exclusively for Children,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/23/business/media/pbs-is-creating-a-channel-exclusively-for-children.html,"PBS is starting a new 24-hour channel dedicated solely to children's programming. The channel, which will be called PBS Kids and will be announced on Tuesday, will be free. It is expected to debut later this year -- most likely in the fall. PBS Kids will also be available online with a live stream. More children's programming is available than ever, much of it being watched through streaming services and on-demand. Netflix has significantly increased its children's offerings in recent years, and it is expected to have 35 original series for children by year's end. Last month, HBO began broadcasting the latest season of ""Sesame Street,"" after it took over first-run rights for the series from PBS. HBO has said more children's programming is coming, and Amazon has also produced shows aimed at that demographic.

PBS will use the channel to broadcast popular shows already on its stations, like ""Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood,"" ""Dinosaur Train"" and ""Wild Kratts."" PBS Kids will exist as a subchannel. Other PBS subchannels include World (which airs mostly documentaries) and Create (which broadcasts shows dedicated to topics like cooking and travel). PBS said the children's channel was not created with a hope of lifting fund-raising efforts, despite the recent loss of the first-air rights to ""Sesame Street."" ""This is not designed in and of itself as a fund-raising effort,"" said Paula Kerger, the chief executive of PBS. The broadcaster said the new channel would be distinguished from other children's programming for the same reason PBS's programming has always stood out: It is free, with an emphasis on educational content. ""There's a huge distinction between the content that's available through other media providers and PBS,"" said Lesli Rotenberg, the broadcaster's general manager of children's programming. ""Even though there may be more, there isn't necessarily more educational content for kids.""

PBS said that its live stream would also offer educational game opportunities for children. Ms. Rotenberg said that PBS's online games received twice as many page views and significantly more users than videos. The idea for PBS Kids arose, in part, because children are watching programs all day, not just in the morning and after school. ""The challenge is when a lot of kids are available to be watching, we are broadcasting other things like the 'NewsHour,' "" Ms. Kerger said. ""There are a lot of children, particularly that are home in early prime time, we aren't able to accommodate them except for on-demand. Given the fact that there are so many kids where on-demand is not an option, we want to be able to reach those kids."" PBS was once in business with Comcast for the 24-hour children's channel called Sprout (the two are no longer connected). Ms. Kerger said that partnership was when PBS learned that there was also a valuable place for children's programming in prime time. ""The assumption was that after 6 at night there wasn't as much an appetite for kids' content,"" she said. ""Actually, deep into prime time, there are still a lot of kids watching television. There is an interesting phenomenon that parents talk about that the time they want public television content is during early evening hours when everyone is just getting home, and they're trying to make dinner, and we're not there.""","The 24-hour channel, PBS Kids, will be free and is expected to debut later this fall.

Dance,Skewering the Pretensions of Their Rarefied Milieu,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/06/arts/dance/larissa-velez-jacksons-star-crap-method-spoofs-dance.html,"To name a performance ""Star Crap Method"" is to lower all expectations except the expectation of humor. And at the Chocolate Factory on Tuesday, when Larissa Velez-Jackson's work had its debut, the disarming effect of the title was reinforced with some preshow karaoke. Audience members were also invited to decorate the theater with objects that evoked the central word in the title.

Yet, as Ms. Velez-Jackson soon explained, there was a method. She and her colleagues, Tyler Ashley and Talya Epstein, would be making up the show on the spot. The lighting designer, Kathy Kaufmann, would be improvising, too. And the person in the ski mask, moving around mirrors on wheels and later referred to as the White Shadow -- that was the stage manager, Lillie De.

The explanation was part of the method. The performers commented on their own performance. This self-described ""transparency around process"" was yet another disclaimer, but it was also part of a joke. Ms. Velez-Jackson's comments, like characterizing the show as ""the complete encapsulation of my entire artistic identity,"" suggested an affectionate insider's sendup of the pieties, pretensions and platitudes common to experimental dance shows at the Chocolate Factory.

Among the items on the wall was a manifesto about resisting ""every possible definition of what dance should be."" The performance took this seriously and didn't. The haphazard movement incorporated various styles of dance, even rehearsed flashes of unison, but the principled adherence to amateurishness put all the pressure on the improvisational wit of the performers, who didn't come close to sustaining interest for the show's 90 minutes.","Sending up the pretensions of experimental dance, Larissa Velez-Jackson presented her work ""Star Crap Method"" at the Chocolate Factory.",b8ad4c70-7e98-58d5-8795-65668c3836c2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/06/arts/STAR/STAR-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=384&w=600&s=0f57f632a42de1c22ec677b96b9749605320c33c4b1cc78dddbf88d6357d5df4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Larissa Velez-Jackson, center, with Tyler Ashley, left, and Talya Epstein in Ms. Velez-Jackson's ""Star Crap Method"" at the Chocolate Factory.",b8ad4c70-7e98-58d5-8795-65668c3836c2,N24News/imgs/b8ad4c70-7e98-58d5-8795-65668c3836c2.jpg,6

Meet the average American man. He weighs 198 pounds and stands 5 feet 9 inches tall. He has a 40-inch waist, and his body mass index is 29 , at the high end of the ""overweight"" category. The picture for the average woman? She is roughly 5 feet 4 inches tall, and weighs 171 pounds, with a 39-inch waist. Her B.M.I. is close to 30. That's a not at all how Americans used to look. New data show that both men and women gained a whopping 24 pounds on average from 1960 to 2002; through 2016, men gained an additional eight pounds, and women another seven pounds. The new report, published by the National Center for Health Statistics, contains some remarkable insights into changes in the American body in recent decades. In 1999, white men averaged 192 pounds, and black men, 189 pounds. By 2016, the average white man weighed 202 pounds, and the average black man, 198 pounds. (These are rounded numbers.) Average waist size among white men increased to 40 inches in 2016 from 39 inches in 1999, and among black men to 39 inches from 38 inches. An average woman in 1999 weighed 164 pounds and had a 36-inch waist. Black women averaged 186 pounds in 2016, almost unchanged since 1999. But the average white woman weighed 162 pounds in 1999 and 171 pounds in 2016. Average waist size among black women in 2016 rose to 40 inches from 39 inches in 2016, and among white women to 38 inches from 36 inches. The C.D.C. has data on Hispanics beginning only in 2007, when Hispanic men weighed on average 184 pounds. By 2016, the figure was 191 pounds. The average Hispanic woman in 2016 weighed 169 pounds, compared with 161 pounds in 2007. Among all men, age-adjusted mean height increased to 69.4 inches (about 5 feet 9 inches) in 2005 from 69.2 inches in 1999, and then decreased to 69.1 inches by 2016. The decrease may result from an increasing population of Mexican-American men, whose average height in 2016 was 66.5 inches. Black men's average height decreased to 69.1 inches in 2016 from 69.3 in 2005. Women's average height did not change significantly over the period. ""People tend to overreport their height and underreport their weight,"" said the senior author, Cynthia L. Ogden, an epidemiologist at the C.D.C.

Dance,"Abuse Accusations Against Peter Martins Are Not Corroborated, Inquiry Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/15/arts/dance/peter-martins-ballet-investigation.html,"A two-month investigation into the conduct of Peter Martins, the former chief of New York City Ballet and its school, did not corroborate any allegations of sexual harassment or physical abuse that several former dancers and others made against him this winter, according to a statement on Thursday. Still, the ballet and school announced new policies to assure that dancers ""feel safe, respected and able to voice their opinions and concerns freely."" The mixed signals -- that there was no verifiable abuse, yet new policies were needed -- infuriated some former dancers who had accused Mr. Martins of misconduct. Yet there were also bound to be frustrations among supporters of Mr. Martins, who retired last month under the pressure of the allegations, even though he professed his innocence and the investigation wasn't complete. Some said they wished he still led the ballet or want to hold a tribute honoring him. Mr. Martins, in a statement provided by his lawyer, said he was ""gratified for the conclusions"" of the investigation, conducted by an outside counsel, Barbara Hoey; her report will not be publicly released.

""I retired to allow those glorious institutions to move past the turmoil that resulted from these charges,"" Mr. Martins, 71, said. ""It is my hope that, with the investigation concluded, they can refocus, without distraction, on their roles as the world's pre-eminent ballet company and school."" The investigation, which was initiated by the company and its School of American Ballet, was denounced Thursday by two former dancers who had come forward with accusations. They said Ms. Hoey, who interviewed them, had seemed sharply skeptical of their accounts of abuse. One of the dancers, Kelly Cass Boal, said she believed that the investigation was a whitewash meant to protect management and Mr. Martins. Ms. Hoey, reached by telephone Thursday, said in response: ""We did not discount anyone's experience. We took all views and all facts into consideration in preparing the report."" Charles W. Scharf, the chairman of the ballet, defended the thoroughness of the investigation, which included interviews with 77 current and former dancers and others. ""I think we've done all that we can at this point. I think we've done what's appropriate, I think we've done what's fair,"" he said in an interview. ""We encouraged people to speak.""

The inquiry was prompted by an anonymous letter sent in early December to the company and school that accused Mr. Martins of sexual harassment. In the wake of the letter's allegation -- the specifics were never released -- several former dancers came forward with reports of physical and verbal abuse by Mr. Martins. Other former dancers described a culture of fear about speaking up, retribution for whistle-blowers and enabling by the board and management. According to the statement from the ballet and school, ""Ultimately the investigation did not corroborate the allegations of harassment or violence both made in the anonymous letter and reported in the media regarding Mr. Martins."" Victor Ostrovsky, who had described being handled violently by Mr. Martins as a 12-year-old student at the ballet school, said on Thursday he was surprised by that conclusion. ""The investigation was improperly done,"" he said. ""They weren't able to prove through witnesses anything? That just doesn't make sense. I was on stage with a bunch of kids -- they all knew what happened."" Mr. Ostrovsky said the outcome only confirmed his misgivings after meeting with the investigator, Ms. Hoey, the management lawyer. ""She wasn't blatantly discrediting me, but it felt like she was suggesting that maybe I didn't experience that,"" Mr. Ostrovsky said. Ms. Boal, a former City Ballet soloist who in December described having been choked by Mr. Martins, said talking to Ms. Hoey ""felt like she was trying to make it sound like what I'm saying is false. They were doing the investigation just to say what they're saying right now.""

""They're going to make it look pretty,"" said Ms. Boal, who is married to Peter Boal, artistic director of Pacific Northwest Ballet in Seattle and director of its school. Many of those who say they were mistreated by Mr. Martins have remarked on the lack of any public statement or apology from the board in response to their accusations regarding Mr. Martins. In particular, several have expressed being disappointed by the public silence from Sarah Jessica Parker, the vice chairwoman of the board, who has been vocal about the Time's Up movement in Hollywood. Ms. Parker, in a text message Thursday, said ""it was very important to me that any allegation was taken seriously"" and that she had supported ""a rigorous outside investigation."" She said she and many current company dancers ""continue to be in conversation"" and that ""their safety and a healthy, creative work environment is paramount to me, always has been and always will be."" A number of current dancers, as well as some current and former board members, have remained loyal to Mr. Martins and continue to regret his departure. Megan Fairchild, a principal dancer with the company, said Thursday, ""This is what I thought would happen, because that's the experience that I had, so I'm not surprised at all."" She added, ""I felt that when he was leaving it was a sad thing and a shame and that we would not be our best company."" Earle Mack, a former trustee, whose wife, Carol D. Mack, continues to serve on the board, said in an interview before the investigation's conclusion that the board ""acted prematurely"" in letting Mr. Martins go.

""It was a kind of knee-jerk reaction,"" Mr. Mack said, ""and he did not deserve that kind of treatment after 34 years of his life running the company, rebuilding the company."" ""If they're not going to give him his due and a fair send-off,"" Mr. Mack added, ""then I will do it."" Mr. Scharf, the board chairman, said of Mr. Martins' departure, ""I feel very comfortable that we're in a place where people are in agreement about going forward this way."" Asked if there would be a tribute to Mr. Martins at some point, Mr. Scharf said, ""We haven't gotten to that point yet."" It remains unclear when a successor to Mr. Martins will be named; Mr. Scharf said the ballet had only begun the search process. A team of dancers is leading the company in the interim: Justin Peck, Rebecca Krohn, Jonathan Stafford and Craig Hall. Because Mr. Martins had been in charge for more than 30 years, Mr. Scharf said, the ballet has an opportunity to examine the role anew, including whether it should be held by just one person and whether that person should head both the company and the school. The statement said that ""enhanced policies and practices"" are being put in place, and that the ballet now has mandatory training programs ""covering employee interactions""; a strengthened code of conduct on equal employment opportunities and nondiscrimination; and ""practices to ensure a workplace that is free from bias, prejudice or harassment.""","Former New York City Ballet dancers accused Mr. Martins of verbal and physical abuse, and an anonymous letter contained sexual harassment allegations against him.",2fce3bee-fa0e-5590-b762-405bfdb3e238,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/16/nyregion/16BALLET/16BALLET-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5c9b45f6014274fa3a599420e1d860f92b3d8e8b08237cb495ba74287cd9624f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Peter Martins, the former leader of the New York City Ballet and its School of American Ballet.",2fce3bee-fa0e-5590-b762-405bfdb3e238,N24News/imgs/2fce3bee-fa0e-5590-b762-405bfdb3e238.jpg,6
Art & Design,A 'Great Wealth Transfer' Is Coming. What Will It Mean for Art?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/arts/design/great-wealth-transfer-art.html,"A 'Great Wealth Transfer' Is Coming. What Will It Mean for Art?

The numbers vary wildly, but all are dizzying: $15 trillion. $30 trillion. $59 trillion. $68 trillion. These are the figures being bandied about as economists and financial experts try to get their heads around a global phenomenon known as the ""Great Wealth Transfer."" Between now and 2030, an estimated $15.4 trillion of assets will have been passed down the generations by the world's richest people, according to a report published this year by the specialist analytics company Wealth-X. ""With the global wealthy population at an all-time high, the next 10 years will see the biggest-ever wealth transfer in modern history,"" said Maeen Shaban, the director of research and data analytics at Wealth-X, whose report concentrates on people with net assets of $5 million or more -- the richest 0.1 percent of global society. The Wealth-X report estimates that America's wealthiest will pass on $8.8 trillion of assets over the next decade. Most of those are baby boomers currently in their mid-60s and older who over the years have benefited from financial deregulation, globalization, and rising real estate and stock prices. They will hand down assets to members of Generation X, in their 40s and 50s, and, to a lesser extent, to millennials now in their mid-20s and 30s, the report says. Most of those assets will be financial: stocks, bonds and trust funds. ""Illiquid assets"" like real estate and investments of passion -- including art -- make up more than $1.9 trillion of the total, according to Wealth-X. Doug Woodham, a managing partner of Art Fiduciary Advisors, an advisory company in New York, said there were many collectors born after 1940 who, ""through a combination of luck and good judgment,"" have bought art from the 1960s, '70s and '80s that has significantly gone up in value. ""There are lots of collections that will come to market over the next 20 years,"" he said. But will today's wealthy 30-somethings and 40-somethings develop a passion for buying art that will maintain its price? Digitally minded millennials' widely observed preference for experiences rather than possessions might suggest otherwise. According to the Wealth-X report, wealthy people aged 70 and over now list art as their sixth most popular interest, passion or hobby. Art drops off the list among those aged under 70, with sports, technology and philanthropy the most popular interests among the under-50s. ""At the moment, people aged about 60 are at the peak of the earning capacity,"" said Marc Porter, the chairman of Christie's America, ""and they are buying postwar art that was collected by their parents' generation. The cycle will change."" Drew Watson, an art services specialist at Bank of America Private Bank, said there was a cultural difference between pre-boomer collectors, motivated by ""connoisseurship and aesthetic appreciation,"" and subsequent generations, who had ""more of an awareness of the financial component of art."" As a result, boomer collectors have been less inclined to donate art to museums, either public or private, and lose a leverageable asset. Out of public spiritedness -- and a desire to reduce tax bills -- collectors from an older generation have tended to keep their masterpieces away from the auctioneer's gavel. In the United States, works donated to nonprofit institutions during a collector's lifetime do not incur capital gains tax. Mr. Woodham pointed out that while masterpieces by the great names of Western art will continue to command exceptional sums, ""second-tier works by second-tier artists"" -- which represent the bulk of what most collectors own -- are ""unlikely to be great stores of value over time."" The price of art is particularly vulnerable to changes in collecting taste, he said. Take Impressionism, the rocket fuel of the late-1980s art boom. Although a superb Monet masterpiece sold for a record $110.7 million at Sotheby's in May, two good, market-fresh landscape paintings by his fellow Impressionist Alfred Sisley were knocked down at Sotheby's to single bids of $1 million in November. Similar works by Sisley routinely sold for about $1.5 million in the 1990s, according to Artnet, the art market information company. Changes in taste could also be a ticking bomb for the Andy Warhol market. In 2017, Jean-Michel Basquiat dethroned Warhol as the biggest-selling American artist at auction, and remained so in 2018, according to Artprice, a French-based analytics company. A Warhol ""Marilyn"" silkscreen painting valued at $50 million is expected to be included in next year's eagerly awaited auction of the $700 million collection of the New York divorcees Harry and Linda Macklowe. That painting may well fetch a spectacular price. But in the long-term, will there be a global depth of demand to support the prices of the many canvases accumulated by boomer collectors? Will 30-something tech magnates connect to Elvis Presley and Elizabeth Taylor? ""You have to be an artist and an activist who fits into a social justice or environmental narrative,"" Mr. Woodham said, characterizing the kind of art that today's younger collectors want to buy. Jayne Wrightsman at home in 1966. The oil heiress's collection will be offered at Christie's next year. Where that will leave the market for dead white male avant-garde artists is anyone's guess. Next April, Christie's will serve as a reminder of the changing vagaries of money and taste when it auctions the private collection of Jayne Wrightsman, the oil heiress, museum patron and society hostess who died in April at age 99. Estimated to raise $8 million, and sold to benefit philanthropy, this material, with its emphasis on 18th-century French decorative arts, represents the apogee of another era of taste from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. A marble-topped upright ""table de cafe"" made in the 1780s by Martin Carlin for the aunts of Louis XVI is estimated to sell for $80,000. Gerald Reitlinger, in his 1963 book, ""The Economics of Taste,"" wrote that back in 1937, when 18th-century French furniture was all the rage with the ultrawealthy, a desk by Carlin sold for 8,000 pounds, or about $700,000 in today's money. That same year, a Cubist still life by Picasso failed to sell at auction for PS105, according to Reitlinger. Wealth-X, in its report, said that ""while the fundamentals of wealth transfer perpetuate, the external environment will continue to evolve."" So, too, will how the wealthy spend their money.","More than $15 trillion in assets is expected to be passed to younger generations in the next decade, including a lot of art.

Israeli researchers followed 125 babies from birth through 10 years. About 43 percent of the mothers had a diagnosis of major depression, and the rest constituted a control group. The study is in Depression & Anxiety.

The investigators tested the children's and mothers' saliva for cortisol, the stress hormone, as well as for an antibody called secretory immunoglobulin A, or SIgA, high levels of which indicate activation of the immune system. They also visited the families to assess the mother's emotional health and to observe behavioral problems in children.

Books,Mughal Men Ruled South Asia — and One Man Was Ruled by a Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/10/books/review/empress-nur-jahan-ruby-lal.html,"Though she was just one of Jahangir's wives, she became his favorite and was often by his side as he traveled his empire. We know that she held a special position, unlike that of any other woman, because she issued royal decrees and coins were minted bearing her name, something done for sovereigns, not their wives. Her rise created tensions in the court and the royal family, which were documented by foreign envoys, who often wrote with disdain about Nur's influence over Jahangir and described him as an alcoholic. Britain's ambassador, Thomas Roe, concluded that Nur ""governs him, and wynds him up at her pleasure.""

While filled with particulars, ""Empress"" can, at times, feel disjointed as Lal breezes over some of the larger developments and changes in Nur's life. While she dwells extensively on the milieu of the harem, she spends little time explaining what led Jahangir to elevate Nur above his other wives. The most we get is the assumption that Jahangir was impressed by Nur's generosity and good will and that she had added influence because her father and brother held important positions at court.

Later Lal abruptly reveals that Nur concluded that Shah Jahan, a son of Jahangir by one of his other wives and widely considered the heir apparent, was a threat to her power, even though she had earlier written that Nur and Shah Jahan were getting on well. The failure to comment on the intervening period is an odd oversight, given that this familial rift would become very consequential when Shah Jahan rebelled against and succeeded his father.

Lal is clearly constrained by the paucity of the material she has to work with. But she seems too reluctant to draw inferences and make analytical deductions. She might not be able to say definitely what transpired between Nur and Jahangir or Nur and Shah Jahan, but she could tell readers what she thinks is the most credible and plausible account. Still, Lal has done a service to readers interested in the Mughal period and the many forgotten or poorly remembered women of Indian history. She has helped shine a little light on an enigmatic character many think they know but few actually understand.","The daughter of Persian immigrants, Nur Jahan became the favorite wife and the co-ruler of Emperor Jahangir.

Sports,"In Competition for Top Jobs, in the N.F.L. and Beyond, It Pays to Be a White Man",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/sports/football/rooney-rule-nfl-coach-diversity.html,"In Competition for Top Jobs, in the N.F.L. and Beyond, It Pays to Be a White Man

The hiring season for head coaches in the N.F.L., the world's richest sports organization, is nearing its end the way it almost does. Five N.F.L. teams replaced their head coaches, and only one of the new hires -- Ron Rivera in Washington -- was not white. After reaching a high-water mark of eight minority coaches two years ago, the league has just four now that the Cleveland Browns reportedly decided on Sunday to hire Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski, who is white, as their head coach. The dearth of coaches of color stands out in a league in which about three-quarters of the players are black, a figure that has steadily risen during the past several decades. The Giants have been criticized by diversity advocates for choosing Joe Judge, a white man, to be their new head coach even though he has no such experience. He does have recommendations from prominent coaches he had worked for, including Bill Belichick, who has led the New England Patriots to six Super Bowl championships. Judge ""just has a certain presence about him,"" Giants co-owner John Mara said, in explaining why Judge stood out.

Hiring processes often include nods toward inclusion. In the N.F.L.'s case, that is the Rooney Rule, which requires teams to ""interview at least one diverse candidate from the Career Development Advisory Panel list or a diverse candidate not currently employed by the club."" The rule has been around since 2003, yet when it's time to choose a leader, decision makers, who are largely white, have usually selected someone who looks like them and they are rarely punished for violating the letter or the spirit of the rule. In addition to the paucity of coaches of color, just two teams employ minority general managers, the senior football position in N.F.L. front offices.

Richard Lapchick, the director of the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, which tracks diversity at major sports leagues, said the N.F.L. and corporate America have the same self-inflicted problem -- a failure to provide access to the clubby, largely white and male world at the highest echelon of power.

* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. ""Corporations are definitely not stocked with women and minorities at its higher ranks,"" Lapchick said. ""It's very much a white man's environment."" But unlike large corporations, which have the flexibility to create new positions and can define success in a multitude of ways, the N.F.L. has a stark racial contrast between its players and coaches that is hard to hide when millions of fans see the team sidelines every weekend. This has turned into a source of embarrassment for the league. ""When we look at the numbers, they're not where they should be,"" Troy Vincent, the executive vice president of football operations at the N.F.L., said last month. ""Who can pound their chest and be proud of what we see?"" Recently, the main avenue to head coaching jobs in the N.F.L. has been experience guiding an offense, a role in which minorities have been underrepresented. Among the 32 teams this season, there were two African-American offensive coordinators and 10 defensive coordinators. In November, the N.F.L. acknowledged that it must do more to promote diversity when it hired Dasha Smith as its chief people officer, responsible for ""talent and diversity strategies"" and other initiatives. Smith previously worked at Sony Music, Time Inc. and at an investment firm.

Unlike big corporations like Sony that have boards and shareholders, the N.F.L.'s 32 owners essentially govern themselves. Commissioner Roger Goodell serves at the pleasure of the owners, and he cannot force them to hire coaches of color, nor can he impose quotas. He rarely uses his bully pulpit to pressure the owners about hiring practices or anything else. Marvin Lewis, who is black and has been without a head coaching job since 2018, acknowledged that owners are essentially unaccountable. ""This is somebody's business, this is somebody's franchise, and nobody's going to tell them who to hire,"" said Lewis, who guided the Cincinnati Bengals to the playoffs seven times in 16 seasons as head coach. Richard Sherman, a cornerback for the San Francisco 49ers, said the actions of N.F.L. owners give him little faith that they have any interest in changing their ways. Just two N.F.L. owners are not white. ""Owners still look a certain way, they still come from a very old background,"" Sherman said. ""They could not care less."" Race continues to be a fraught issue for the N.F.L. The league was roiled when black players knelt during the playing of the national anthem to shine a light on police brutality. The controversy went into hyper-drive when President Trump urged the owners to fire players who protested. Colin Kaepernick, the former quarterback who popularized kneeling during the anthem, has been out of work since 2017.

Diversity advocates say that the preference for white coaches and general managers is unlikely to change much until more team owners are people of color. While 28 percent of management jobs at the league headquarters belong to people of color, the representation among the teams' top front-office executives is 11 percent, according to the Institute for Diversity and Ethics in Sport, which compiles an annual report on the hiring of women and minorities in the N.F.L. ""People hire people they're comfortable with, and the people you feel most comfortable with are people with similar ideas,"" said Rod Graves, a former N.F.L. general manager and league executive who now runs the Fritz Pollard Alliance, which promotes diversity in football. Jerry Jones, the owner of the Cowboys, hired Mike McCarthy, who won a Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers. Both men are white. While the Cowboys followed the Rooney Rule and interviewed minority candidates, Jones revealed that he'd had his heart set on McCarthy all along. ""I knew Mike McCarthy long before he ever walked through these doors,"" Jones said on Wednesday. ""So much more went into how and why he's sitting at this table today."" The job interview, it seemed, was a mere formality. As for the Giants, Mara touted the team's search process, which he said included ""the deepest and most talented group of candidates that I've seen."" Judge, 38, who until this season had never coached a unit in the N.F.L. other than special teams, prevailed because of his intangibles, Mara said. Experts say the only way the N.F.L. will change is if the owners take it upon themselves to expand their view of available candidates.

The Rooney Rule could require teams to interview minority candidates not just for head coach and general manager, but for other coaching jobs. The rule could be expanded to front office positions, Graves at the Fritz Pollard Alliance said. The league office took a similar step in 2016 when it mandated that at least one woman be interviewed for any executive openings in the N.F.L. head office. However, any rule forcing change would require N.F.L. owners to do something they rarely do -- strip themselves of the power to do what they want.","Only one of five head coach openings in the N.F.L. this off-season has been filled by a person of color, which is how it often goes at the country's elite organizations.",bef70366-c6cb-52e0-ae3b-42486894237b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/10/sports/10rooney/merlin_166890903_774a5699-3131-4960-9447-64e1aa551a06-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cb124105cf76fe8506834f92ecd3da913e206b35be9ff9b3d022c64f7206f6b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Giants introduced Joe Judge, center, as their new head coach on Thursday.",bef70366-c6cb-52e0-ae3b-42486894237b,N24News/imgs/bef70366-c6cb-52e0-ae3b-42486894237b.jpg,9
Dance,"Odysseys Into Martha Graham World, One Dramatic, the Other Abstract",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/02/arts/dance/martha-graham-pam-tanowitz-maxine-doyle.html,"Martha Graham dancers rehearse Bobbi Jene Smith and Maxine Doyle's new work, ""Deo,"" inspired by the myth of Demeter and Persephone.

Female power is something that Martha Graham radiated. This revolutionary modern dance choreographer, who once said that the only sin a person could have was mediocrity, created a repertory that celebrates women in all their grief and triumph. This season, the Martha Graham Dance Company explores female empowerment with the start of its two-year EVE Project, commemorating the 1920 ratification of the 19th Amendment that gave women the power to vote. Included are two new works: Pam Tanowitz's ""Untitled (Souvenir),"" in which she merges Graham's steps with her own; and ""Deo,"" a collaboration by Maxine Doyle and Bobbi Jene Smith. Inspired by the myth of Demeter and Persephone, ""Deo"" explores issues surrounding women and mortality with, aptly, an all-female cast. Janet Eilber, the company's artistic director, said it was important for the works to be different in approach. She chose her choreographers accordingly: drama on one side (Ms. Doyle and Ms. Smith) and pure movement on the other (Ms. Tanowitz).

Ms. Doyle, the associate director and choreographer of the British theater company Punchdrunk brought in Ms. Smith; they met when Ms. Smith performed in the immersive ""Sleep No More,"" one of Punchdrunk's best-known productions. Before that, Ms. Smith was a member of Batsheva Dance Company where she trained in Gaga, the sensation-based dance language created by the choreographer Ohad Naharin. While Ms. Smith veers toward luscious, deeply felt movement, Ms. Tanowitz loves to invent steps and to mine dance history for inspiration. She's done both for her premiere, in which she regards Graham's steps and set pieces -- a few will decorate the stage, but subtly so -- as souvenirs, or mementos, from her body of work. Specifically, she's used movement from ""The Legend of Judith"" (1967), which she said she related to on a visceral level; and ""Dark Meadow"" (1946), one of her favorite Graham works. ""I wanted the balance of Martha's abstraction and her modernism,"" Ms. Eilber said. ""Pam's into puzzle solving, lines. It was also the fact that she was really interested in the idea of borrowing Graham material and transforming it."" Ms. Doyle and Ms. Smith were all about delving into the dancers' inherent theatricality. Ms. Tanowitz had a different mission: ""How do we keep the physicality,"" she said, ""but take away the overlay of the drama?""

In the end, what the works have in common is how they expose something singular: The dancers as individuals. What follows are edited excerpts from recent interviews with the choreographers about their odysseys into the world of Graham. GRAHAM, PAM, GRAHAM, PAM I spliced together movement. I would take one step from Graham's ""The Legend of Judith"" and one step from Pam, and sew them together. That became a whole new phrase. In rehearsals, the dancers would be like, ""Graham, Pam, Graham, Pam."" I also took the male solo from ""Dark Meadow"" and made it a male trio. Lorenzo Pagano's doing the legs and the torso, Lloyd Mayor is doing the arms and then I have Lloyd Knight reversing it all. A DANCE NERD'S DREAM COME TRUE I watched archival videos and that's where ""The Legend of Judith"" came in. I'm a dance nerd so it's all really exciting to me. The dancers learned all the movement before I walked in for the first rehearsal. It was like Christmas morning: I had all of these steps to choose from. But it's scary. I have to say that. I try to forget about it and honor it, but I feel the weight of history on me.

SHE COULDN'T HELP HERSELF I planned on using existing Graham material that wasn't necessarily well known, but I watched a rehearsal of ""Dark Meadow,"" which is a very famous piece I'm obsessed with. It starts out in silence -- it's basically step-touch, step-touch and to me it's about group will and strong women. I couldn't stop thinking about it so I used it. I broke my own rule. NO DRAMA QUEENS What I'm asking them to do -- to take away the drama -- is very challenging. They don't need to look out and to be presentational. I tell them to take their focus in. It's strong and what we realized is that it's created a different kind of drama: It's about being present in the physicality and dancing with people onstage. THE OUTCOME This showed me that my movement isn't so different from Graham's. [Laughs] It has told me that dance is dance and steps are steps. Aside from the obvious of the Graham architecture of the hands or the highly stylized head, the actual steps are steps that we all use. Lloyd Knight: ""You come in as you, and that's a great feeling. You are performing, but it's in a very stripped-down way. I loved every minute of it. The drama isn't there, but in a weird way it brings up feelings: You're just coming out as yourself.""

Bobbi Jene Smith Gaga and the Graham movement are very different, but there's something impulsively animal about the connection to pleasure and strength and power and imagination, and that magical combination of content and action and physicality. They both create that. Doyle The myth of Demeter and Persephone really spoke to me as a woman, it spoke to me as a mother and it spoke to me as a daughter. I was thinking about how the work would sit within the rep, and how it could honor, in some way, the themes and concerns and ideas of Graham as a creator. Rather than telling the story or the narrative of Demeter, we decided to look more at the themes of the story, which are separation, rage and grief. Doyle I worked with a process that is about using dramatic tone and physical tensions in the body to tell stories and express emotion. There's an inherent sensuality and connection to their vulnerability and their madness, and the distance between those two things, that I'm really drawn to. Smith I don't think you could ever ask them, ""What are you thinking about in this moment?"" and they'd say, ""Oh nothing, I don't know yet. I'm working on it."" They're coming with a whole vessel of memories and stories in their bodies. Xin Ying: ""Bobbi talks about how as a woman you're almost like a mountain: You have your leg muscles, and you want to feel the power of them. You don't think, oh my legs are too big. [Laughs] Suddenly I feel, Oh, I'm beautiful just the way I am.""","Two Graham company commissions — by Maxine Doyle and Bobbi Jene Smith, and by Pam Tanowitz — lean into different sides of Martha the creator.",6b7b7612-d8e2-513b-9ddb-873aefb6797a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/03/arts/02graham-womeni/02graham-womeni-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=5317897ca366e42cf8dbdfe1291dbd1bd87077db5705724e26cb7a3a01dd81e7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Martha Graham dancers rehearse Bobbi Jene Smith and Maxine Doyle&rsquo;s new work, &ldquo;Deo,&rdquo; inspired by the myth of Demeter and Persephone.",6b7b7612-d8e2-513b-9ddb-873aefb6797a,N24News/imgs/6b7b7612-d8e2-513b-9ddb-873aefb6797a.jpg,6

This clever, clockwork song has Ed Sheeran abetted by the pop pros Max Martin and Shellback. True to Sheeran's catalog, it's a tale of insecurity at a party that somehow turns to romance: ""You take my hand, finish my drink, say shall we dance."" The crucial clockwork is Afro-Caribbean: the syncopated backbeat that links dancehall, reggaeton and dembow, which is stripped down and then decorated differently verse to verse. Along the way arrive high piano chords, backup ""oohs,"" a ""hell yeah"" out of Beck, floating keyboard notes and Justin Bieber's Auto-Tuned vocals joining in for star power in the guise of male bonding. Without that Afro-Caribbean beat, the song wouldn't exist. JON PARELES

The titans of grime have remained admirably true to form even as their popularity has exploded far beyond what seemed possible even a few years ago. Stormzy, long the genre's most accessible star, will be one of the headliners at the Glastonbury Festival next month, a first for a grime artist. His new single ""Vossi Bop"" bested Taylor Swift to top the British singles chart. It's fleet, confident, almost joyous hip-hop, skipping out on low end almost entirely in favor of some chipper boasts and a flow that oozes from one bar to the next. Meanwhile, Skepta remains a ferocious and tart rapper, and ""Bullet From a Gun"" continues the bruising, both in the way he jabs his syllables, and also in his sentiments: ""See it's too easy to write a sad song about how my dad raised me/'Cause I'm looking in the mirror and my dad made me/A real top boy, I just can't play the victim."" JON CARAMANICA

Whatever her partner did, it wasn't minor. ""You need to stay out of my way,"" Jhene Aiko warns. ""Triggered"" circles through a few piano chords as she processes a major betrayal. It's a negotiation with her partner, with herself, with her continued attachment and her roiling anger: ""You are my enemy, you are no friend of mine,"" she decides, but moments later realizes she's still attracted. ""All that history, all that's history,"" she says, but soon realizes, ""I'll calm down eventually."" Emotionally, this story isn't over. PARELES Zayn and Zhavia Ward, 'A Whole New World (End Title)'

""Contra Todo"" -- ""Against All"" is the battle cry that opens ""Almadura,"" the second solo album by iLe: Ileana Mercedes Cabra Joglar, who sang and rapped for a decade with Calle 13. With a melody that hints at Afro-Caribbean chants, an obstinate drumbeat and burly saxophones backing her up, she vows -- for herself and, it seems, for her hurricane-battered home, Puerto Rico -- to become ""the shout of a silenced voice."" PARELES

Everyone misses Sade during her long silences, and for some songwriters, it's an opportunity to provide mantras of melancholy. As part of a new EP titled ""Spirit,"" Rhye -- the songwriter Michael Milosh -- croons ""I want to be needed/that's what I need"" in a track that's as intricate as it is subdued; a full band and string arrangement infuse themselves behind the echoey piano chords that begin the song. The singer and songwriter Niia collaborates with the producer Robin Hannibal, a founder and ex-member of Rhye, in the even slower, preternaturally hazy ""If I Cared,"" which gradually reveals its pitilessness in a sweet whisper: ""I don't want to hurt you/again and again,"" Niia sings, but then again, ""you're weak by nature/and I'm sharp like a razor."" PARELES Mark Dresser Seven, 'Black Arthur's Bounce (In Memory of Arthur Blythe)'

The name of the new album from Mark Dresser, a bassist with unimpeachable avant-garde credentials and a waxy, flexible attack, is ""Ain't Nothing But a Cyber Coup & You."" As you might expect, it's a healthy mix of droll irreverence and life-or-death conviction, played by a septet of masterful improvisers. Who else embodied this kind of musical approach? Nobody better than Arthur Blythe, the underappreciated alto saxophonist known as ""Black Arthur,"" who died in 2017. On ""Black Arthur's Bounce,"" Dresser pays homage as he leads his band through crooked dance grooves, well-cropped swing, riotous bursts of improvising and, finally, an almost-peaceful fade away. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

The ASAP Mob first arrived in hip-hop as a crew of aesthetes, but what's become clear over time is that the mode the members thrive in the most is rowdy rhyming. ""Pups,"" the new ASAP Ferg single, is essentially a remake of DMX's ""Get at Me Dog,"" delivered with the rawness of a freestyle on an old DJ Clue mixtape. While Ferg leans in to his sense of humor, ASAP Rocky doubles down on the clipped, nimble flows that he sometimes abandons on his solo projects, but which mark him as an inventive rapper hiding in plain sight. CARAMANICA

The latest project from Davis, an emerging alto saxophonist, is Alula, her most formally innovative group yet. It's a trio, with two established experimentalists laying the foundation under her sax: Matt Mitchell on synthesizers and Gregory Saunier (best known as a member of Deerhoof) on drums. Each of the 11 tunes on her new album has its own identity, but they're all unified by a loose, scrappy energy and a dedication to serious plotting. ""Landing"" stands out, for its papery synth sound, long sax tones and percussion that sounds like a marching-band drummer rehearsing alone in an empty auditorium. It's just the right amount of unsettling -- like what you'd expect to hear in the background after a confounding, climactic scene in a great Lynch film. RUSSONELLO","Hear tracks by Mary J.

Health,Many Medical Decision Tools Disadvantage Black Patients,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/17/health/many-medical-decision-tools-disadvantage-black-patients.html,"Unbeknown to most patients, their race is incorporated into numerous medical decision-making tools and formulas that doctors consult to decide treatment for a range of conditions and services, including heart disease, cancer and maternity care, according to a new paper published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine. The unintended result, the paper concludes, has been to direct medical resources away from black patients and to deny some black patients treatment options available to white patients. The tools are often digital calculators on websites of medical organizations or -- in the case of assessing kidney function -- actually built into the tools commercial labs use to calculate normal values of blood tests. They assess risk and potential outcomes based on formulas derived from population studies and modeling that looked for variables associated with different outcomes. ""These tests are woven into the fabric of medicine,"" said Dr. David Jones, the paper's senior author, a Harvard historian who also teaches ethics to medical students.

""Despite mounting evidence that race is not a reliable proxy for genetic difference, the belief that it is has become embedded, sometimes insidiously, within medical practice,"" he wrote. The paper is being published at a tense moment in American society as black communities, disproportionately affected by the coronavirus, protest unequal treatment in other areas of their lives. Dr. Jones said he believed the developers of the tools, who often are academic researchers, are motivated by empiricism, not racism. But the results, his analysis found, have often led to black patients being steered away from treatments or procedures that white patients received. The paper included a chart listing nine areas of medicine where there are race-based tests, and it analyzed the consequences. For example, it reported, labs routinely use a kidney function calculator that adjusts filtration rates for black patients. With the adjustment, black patients end up with slightly better rates than whites, which can be enough to make those with borderline rates ineligible to be on a kidney transplant list. An online osteoporosis risk calculator endorsed by the National Osteoporosis Foundation, among others, calculates chances of a fracture differently for black and white women. Black women end up having a score that makes them less likely to be prescribed osteoporosis medication than white women who are similar in other respects.

An obstetric calculator based on observational data concludes that black women who had a previous cesarean birth are less likely to have a successful vaginal birth in a subsequent pregnancy. Dr. Jones added that it is time to stop what amounts to racial profiling in medicine. ""We need to get off this train,"" he said. The New England Journal paper built on a collection of recent findings and assessments, including those in a recent paper about kidney function by Dr. Nwamaka Denise Eneanya and her colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania. To determine how well kidneys are working, doctors use a blood test that measures a protein called creatinine to estimate kidney filtration rate. Low filtration rates indicate a kidney problem. Dr. Eneanya's team noted that patients with a filtration rate of less than 30 were referred to kidney specialists. They gave an example of a white patient whose level was 28, according to the calculator. A black patient with the same creatinine level would get a race correction under the formula that raises the level to 33. Consequently, the black patient would not get a referral to a specialist. The same effect could make some black patients ineligible to be put on a list for a kidney transplant -- those with filtration rates of 20 or above are ineligible. The formula originated with data from a federal study more than two decades ago that asked if a low-protein diet reduced the risk of kidney disease (it did not, the study showed). The study included precise measures of kidney function and creatinine levels, which let researchers use creatinine to estimate kidney function. The formula fit the data best when they included an adjustment for black patients.

In a more recent paper, in 2009, the researchers combined data from a number of studies to devise an improved formula, asking which variables made the formula best fit the data. Race popped up again. ""The formula was widely adopted,"" said Dr. Melanie Hoenig, a kidney specialist at Harvard Medical School. One of its principal authors, Dr. Lesley Inker, a kidney specialist at Tufts Medical Center, said she hears the critics. ""What we say is, 'You're right. I understand the difficulty in assigning race,'"" Dr. Inker said. She is working on developing a more accurate formula that does not include race. She added that black patients should be told that their race alters the calculation and should be given an option to have their race excluded. But, she says, the current formula also can be an advantage for black patients. Those with filtration rates below 30 are ineligible to be prescribed metformin, the first line drug for diabetes, and SGLT2 inhibitors, a more recent class of diabetes drugs. One problem, is that it is not clear how race is determined. It shows up in medical records but, said Dr. Peter Reese, a kidney transplant specialist and epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, ""I worry that in some situations they look at you and assume."" With the formulas, there is no accounting for people of mixed race, as the authors of the New England Journal paper and other doctors have noted.

Even if race does have a real effect on lab values for creatinine, why assume it is because of the genetics that determine skin color, some experts asked. ""It could be diet or any of a number of things,"" Dr. Hoenig said, noting that a large protein-heavy meal can temporarily raise creatinine levels. One often cited explanation is the belief that black people are more muscular than white people, and muscles can release creatinine into the blood. In a recent paper, Dr. Vanessa Grubbs, a kidney specialist at the University of California, San Francisco, tried to trace the origins of that belief and found only a few decades-old studies that did not even measure muscle mass directly, including one saying black children are thinner than white children. A group of medical students at Harvard has been trying to change the approach to assessing kidney function, with some success. The group, including Leo Eisenstein, Danika Barry and Cameron Nutt, had heard Dr. Jones in lectures saying race was a social construct and then went into the clinic, where they were told to use a formula that corrects for race in assessing kidney function. Instead of complaining, Dr. Hoenig told the students, why not go to the leadership and suggest a change? Labs could simply not list race when sending in blood tests for creatinine -- in that case the formula's default would be the level for whites. Or they could give results as a range and explain to patients that the numbers are an estimate. A few years ago, Dr. Hoenig and the students made the rounds to executives at Beth Israel Medical Center.","Doctors look to these digital calculators to make treatment decisions, but they can end up denying black patients access to certain specialists, drugs and transplants.",886680d1-8e27-57f0-861e-7afd697bb26f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/16/science/167RACE-MEDICINE/167RACE-MEDICINE-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7eefe097923af945d3971473c21da71d4ecc10eba58bef8fe0af9439cfa1b077&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A dialysis specialist donned personal protective equipment before treating a patient with coronavirus in a Maryland hospital.

Economy,Few New Jobs as Jobless Rate Rises to 9.8%,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/04/business/economy/04jobs.html,"After several months of improvement, hiring by businesses slowed to a crawl in November, a development that is sure to intensify the debate over what can and should be done to reignite the economy. The United States added a total of just 39,000 jobs last month, down from an upwardly revised gain of 172,000 in October, the Labor Department reported on Friday. With local governments shedding jobs, the additions in the private sector were too small to reduce the ranks of the unemployed or even to keep pace with people entering the work force. The unemployment rate, which is based on a separate survey of households, rose to 9.8 percent in November. It was the highest jobless rate since April and up from 9.6 percent in October. The outlook remains bleak. More than 15 million people are out of work, among them 6.3 million who have been jobless for six months or longer. Many are about to exhaust their unemployment benefits, which have been extended repeatedly by the government because of the severity of the downturn.

The latest snapshot of the labor market cast a pall over what had been a brightening picture of a steadying economy. In recent weeks, the average number of people applying for unemployment benefits has generally declined. Pending home sales topped forecasts in October, while last month retail sales posted one of the biggest increases in years. The anemic job figures could lend support to the Obama administration's call to extend unemployment benefits as well as to recent efforts by Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, to continue to stimulate the economy. Plodding economic growth, however, seems insufficient to persuade businesses to hire. ""Obviously this is a disappointing report, to say the least,"" James F. O'Sullivan, chief economist at MF Global, said of the monthly jobs data. But given other promising signs, he said, he did not believe the recovery had been derailed. ""Certainly the weight of evidence is that the economy is improving."" Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said, ""This highlights that the recovery is fragile."" In addition to pressing for an extension of unemployment benefits, he called for a continuation of what are known as the Bush tax cuts for the middle class as well as a collection of proposals that the White House is now referring to as the Obama tax cuts. ""To have taxes go up on 98 percent of Americans,"" Mr. Goolsbee said, ""would pose a risk to the aggregate economic performance.""

The weak November job numbers will also feed the politically charged debate over whether the government should seek to aggressively reduce the deficit or be willing to spend more until the economy returns to better health. The stock markets shrugged off the report, which was well shy of the forecast for a gain of 150,000 jobs, as all the major indexes rose slightly on Friday. Part of the surprise in the November report was that layoffs, which had subsided earlier this year, picked up again. The number of people who were unemployed because they had been laid off or had concluded a temporary assignment increased by 390,000. Private companies, which have been hiring since the beginning of the year, added 50,000 jobs in November. Most of those increases came in the temporary help and health care sectors. Manufacturers, which had demonstrated some strength earlier in the year, eliminated 13,000 jobs, and despite recent sales increases, the retail sector shed more than 28,000 jobs. One sign of continued insecurity among employers was that temporary workers accounted for 40,000 of the jobs added in the private sector. Staffing firms said companies were continuing to use contract workers to fill gaps rather than binding themselves to permanent employees. Employers are ""still in the position of saying, 'Hey, we need help, but only when we absolutely have to do we commit to permanent hiring,' "" said Tig Gilliam, chief executive of Adecco North America. ""That uncertainty takes time to overcome."" Included in the latest report were revisions for previous months. The agency said that the economy added 172,000 jobs in October, more than the 151,000 it originally reported. Many risks remain for the economy. The latest report showed 14,000 jobs were cut by local governments, a decline that could accelerate if states and towns were required to prune further to deal with shrinking budgets and larger deficits.

With President Obama's deficit commission examining long-term spending cuts, unemployment benefits expiring and a Congressional fight looming over tax cuts, consumers could become more reluctant to spend despite some recent signs of renewed vigor. That, in turn, could cause businesses to reconsider hiring plans. Advocates for the unemployed expressed dismay over the latest jobs report. ""I'm still trying to get my jaw off the floor,"" said Andrew Stettner, deputy director of the National Employment Law Project. ""What it does is it kills the story that maybe I thought we could start telling, which was steady improvement. If we had four months in a row of improving jobs numbers, we would still need a lot of work to get back to full employment, but now it's not even moving in the right direction."" The absence of robust hiring has puzzled some because companies are enjoying strong earnings and building large cash reserves. ""A lot of this profit increase has come about from cost-cutting,"" said Kevin Logan, chief United States economist in HSBC's global banking and markets unit. ""And I think a lot of businesses are saying they don't have the pricing power they'd like, and they're cautious about growth in final demand, and that may be reflected back to decisions about investment and job creation."" Analysts generally estimate that the economy needs to add 100,000 to 125,000 jobs a month simply to keep up with new entrants to the labor force. So if employers keep hiring at the pace of recent months, it will do little to help reduce the unemployment rate for some time. At November's pace, the unemployment rate could actually rise further. Some have predicted an unemployment rate of 10 percent next year. There was little sign that companies were straining to meet demand by pushing existing workers. The average workweek held steady at 34.3 hours, while average hourly earnings increased by just 1 percent, to $22.75. Usually, growth in wages and the number of hours worked point to more hiring. The median length of time the unemployed had been out of work rose to 21.6 weeks, the third consecutive monthly increase. For those who have been searching for work for more than six months, this is a particularly discouraging prospect.","The economy added only 39,000 jobs in November, dampening hopes that a recovery was building.",15e374d3-13a5-5533-8c69-aec5595b618e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/04/business/economy/04jobs-395/04jobs-395-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=b257afc1253eb0060130b7f0e3c8cd992f845d972f8b32a93487405f3a6ca702&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A job applicant, left, speaks with a career consultant at the Workforce Alliance Career Center in West Palm Beach, Fla., this week.",15e374d3-13a5-5533-8c69-aec5595b618e,N24News/imgs/15e374d3-13a5-5533-8c69-aec5595b618e.jpg,8
Real Estate,Frida Kahlo Never Slept Here,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/22/realestate/frida-kahlo-never-slept-here.html,"Ever wonder how Jimi Hendrix's bedroom would look if he were alive today?

No? Well, one British company has reimagined it anyway, along with contemporary bedrooms for four other historical figures: William Shakespeare, Queen Elizabeth I, Coco Chanel and Frida Kahlo. Neville Johnson, which makes bespoke furniture and staircases, commissioned iProspect, a public relations and creative agency, to come up with the digital renderings, modeled by studying each individual's style attributes and the homes he or she once occupied.

Mr. Hendrix, it appears, would fit right in with the recent boho interiors trend. His imagined bedroom is a kind of upscale, white-walled hippie loft, with clashing Persian rugs, a leather pouf and other low furniture. Ms. Chanel's boudoir, on the other hand, maintains her famous black-and-white palette and has the opulent but impersonal look of a luxury hotel room (she lived at the Ritz in Paris).

The project may seem a bit random, like a pandemic-inspired PR stunt, but it's not exactly a one-off. iProspect has created similar what-ifs for other clients, imagining the New York that could have been -- filled with ambitious projects that were never built -- for Barratt London, a U.K. homebuilder, and offering modern takes on the pub featured in the long-running British TV show ""Coronation Street,"" for David Wilson Homes, another homebuilder.

Science,Tiny Brains Don't Stop These Birds From Having a Complex Society,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/science/birds-society-vulturine-guineafowl.html,"The vulturine guineafowl of eastern Africa ""don't only have small brains relative to mammals,"" said one researcher. ""They also have quite small brains relative to other birds.""



A pack of baldheaded, boldly plumaged birds steps through the grass shoulder to shoulder, red eyes darting around. They look like middle schoolers seeking a cafeteria table at lunchtime. Perhaps they're not so different. A study published Monday in Current Biology shows that the vulturine guineafowl of eastern Africa, like humans, have many-layered societies. In the past, scientists hypothesized that such social structures require a lot of brainpower. But the pea-brained guineafowl are revealing the flaws in that assumption. Damien Farine, who led the research and is an ornithologist at the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior who studies collective behavior, first worked in Kenya during his postdoctoral research on baboon societies. Baboons are a model for researchers trying to understand how human society evolved. Some kinds of baboons live in groups within groups, a structure that's called a multilevel society. ""Humans are the classic multilevel society,"" Dr. Farine said. Imagine a human family living in a village: The family might be friendly with other families within the village, which in turn might have ties to neighboring villages, and so on.

Keeping track of these relationships can be complicated. ""People have long hypothesized that living in complex society is one of the reasons why we've evolved such large brains,"" Dr. Farine said. Researchers have found evidence for multilevel societies in some other large-brained mammals, such as monkeys, elephants, giraffes and sperm whales. But as Dr. Farine studied baboons, he also watched the vulturine guineafowl wandering around his study site. ""I was really struck by the social behavior that they exhibited,"" he said. These hefty birds can fly, but rarely choose to. Instead, they stroll across the landscape in packs, often walking so closely that their bodies touch. They may chase each other or fight to maintain their strict hierarchies. But at other times they engage in friendly behaviors like sharing food. Their groups are unusually large for birds, sometimes including 60 or more individuals. And while most other social birds are very territorial, Dr. Farine says, groups of vulturine guineafowl don't mind sharing turf. He suspected the guineafowl might have a social structure just as interesting as baboons. So he and his colleagues began an intensive study of vulturine guineafowl society at the Mpala Research Center in Nanyuki, Kenya. For a year, they made daily observations of 441 birds -- nearly every adult in the local population. They counted 18 groups in total. Colored leg bands in unique combinations let researchers tell the black-and-blue birds apart. Scientists also attached little solar-powered GPS devices to the backs of 58 birds, including one or more in each group. This let them see exactly where every group went, 24 hours a day, for a whole year. They found that group membership was stable; birds stuck with their pack. Each group included multiple breeding pairs, along with other birds. Groups often met and interacted -- in fact, certain groups seemed to prefer hanging out together. Some groups even bunked together at night. ""Even though they did not share the same home range during the day, they seemed to seek each other out at night and roost together,"" Dr. Farine said.

The birds would all fly into the trees to sleep, then alight in the morning -- hundreds of birds milling around in one place -- and gradually sort themselves back into their original groups for the day. The vulturine guineafowl, in other words, have a multilevel society. There are groups within groups within the population as a whole. Dr. Farine says there even seem to be clusters of friends within the small groups. This is the first time anyone has observed such a society in a bird. And Dr. Farine emphasizes this particular bird's poor intellectual endowment: ""They don't only have small brains relative to mammals. They also have quite small brains relative to other birds,"" he said. Larissa Swedell, a biological anthropologist at Queens College in New York who studies baboons, finds the results convincing. ""It looks like they have demonstrated a multilevel society, which is really interesting in these small-brained birds,"" she said. ""But it's not completely surprising."" That's because even among primates, Dr. Swedell says, it's not always the brainiest species that have multilevel societies. Living in this kind of society might actually make it easier to keep track of the social order. For example, if groups are stable and a bird or baboon can identify just one or two individuals within a group, it knows which group it's looking at -- no need for a brain that can recognize every single animal. Multilevel societies also let animals adjust their group sizes based on whatever challenges they're facing, Dr. Swedell says. Depending on what predators or resources are around, it might make sense to travel in a conglomerate group rather than a smaller one. She notes that baboon groups may also come together to sleep, like the vulturine guineafowl. Dr. Farine agrees that the vulturine guineafowl might not be all that unusual. ""Having a multilevel structure may, in and of itself, not require having a large brain,"" he said.",Scientists discovered that vulturine guineafowl live in multilevel societies reminiscent of our own.,b7960da1-f07b-515a-a48c-4f8c4cfcee9d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/12/science/04TB-BIRDSSOCIETY1/04TB-BIRDSSOCIETY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=1953b6b735238fca00c0842150d0b97fc2e28d24d41027ef2b6838dbc6307d31&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The vulturine guineafowl of eastern Africa &ldquo;don&rsquo;t only have small brains relative to mammals,&rdquo; said one researcher. &ldquo;They also have quite small brains relative to other birds.&rdquo;",b7960da1-f07b-515a-a48c-4f8c4cfcee9d,N24News/imgs/b7960da1-f07b-515a-a48c-4f8c4cfcee9d.jpg,2
Your Money,Putting an Estate Value on the Assets Unique to You,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/your-money/putting-an-estate-value-on-the-assets-unique-to-you.html,"J. D. Salinger working on ""Catcher in the Rye"" during World War II. Mr. Salinger died in 2010, but newly discovered manuscripts could greatly increase the value of his estate.

MICHAEL JACKSON and J. D. Salinger would seem to have had little in common beyond being famous, reclusive (to different degrees) and the subject of much speculation about their personal lives. But in death the King of Pop and the author of ""The Catcher in the Rye"" have become sources of fascination and speculation among estate lawyers and the people charged with putting a price on hard-to-value assets, like royalties that continue paying after they are gone. Mr. Jackson, who died in June 2009, had revenue from his songs and his share in a music catalog; Mr. Salinger, who died in January 2010, had the royalty income from his books, which continue to be read and taught in schools. But the speculation arises over what may not have been known or calculated at the time of their deaths. Mr. Jackson's death was good for his earning potential -- his estate now receives hundreds of millions of dollars a year, according to an analysis by Forbes. As for Mr. Salinger, a new documentary film claims that he had five finished manuscripts that will be published starting in 2015 and are likely to sell well. In both instances, it would have been hard to know the value of those assets when their creators died, particularly in Mr. Jackson's case. He had not had a successful record in many years, and the value of the record catalog was lower at the end of the recession than it is today. But trying to divine such values, however difficult, is an important part of settling any estate and avoiding the ire of the Internal Revenue Service. It also applies more broadly than many people think.

""The appraisal process is more of an art than a science,"" said Richard A. Behrendt, director of estate planning at the financial services firm Baird and a former I.R.S. inspector. ""When I was auditing returns, more than half the issues were valuation issues because of the speculative nature of appraisals. It's very common."" Property like a privately held small business, a big art collection, a share in rental properties or intellectual property like television or movie credits, patents or even Web site domain names are not as easy to value as, say, a stock portfolio. Executors of estates for people who owned small businesses, particularly in service areas like law, accounting or medicine, where the revenue is reliant upon the owner, often face the opposite problem of the Salinger and Jackson estates: the values plummet when their owners are gone, but the I.R.S. still assesses a tax on the value at the date of death. ""My husband and I own a law firm, and part of the appeal of our law firm is us,"" said Kelly Phillips Erb, a lawyer outside Philadelphia who has blogged on the tax matters related to the Jackson estate. ""If we're not around the next day, the value of the firm isn't worth as much. The I.R.S. doesn't care, and that presents a challenge for small-business owners."" She said keeping detailed records, like minute books, and updating stock certificates helps in establishing a case for a certain valuation. An estate can also ask the I.R.S. to use an alternate valuation date that is six months after the date of death to take into consideration a loss of value.

Another debate occurs when the valuations are far apart. This happened in the Jackson case. When he died in June 2009, the recession seemed to be dragging on and his reputation was in tatters from years of lawsuits and accusations of molesting children. After his death his reputation markedly improved and his music began selling again. The following year, in September 2010, the National Bureau of Economic Research declared that the recession had actually ended the previous June, around the time of his death, so in hindsight the future value of his record catalog was higher. Yet the values assigned by the appraisers for Mr. Jackson's estate and those for the I.R.S. were so far apart that the I.R.S. filed suit asking for $700 million in estate taxes and penalties. The issue now turns on whether Mr. Jackson's estate was worth nearly as much in the moment before he died as the I.R.S. contends it was worth after. Lance S. Hall, president of FMV Opinions, an appraisal firm that lost a bid to value the Jackson estate, said such wide disparities were becoming common, because the I.R.S. uses the higher value as a negotiating tactic. ""Suppose the real value of an estate is $20 million, and suppose the taxpayer's expert comes in at $17 million,"" Mr. Hall said. ""The I.R.S.'s valuation engineer is likely to come in at $40 million. That's going to scare the living daylights out of a person. But in the negotiation, the I.R.S. might get more because they could settle on $28 million.""

Mr. Hall said that there were not always ways to prevent such a dispute, but that he encouraged clients being audited to persist to the appeals stage, where the auditors either have to settle the case or bring in an outside appraiser who might have to defend his valuation in court. The problem for the Salinger estate may be closer to what happens to people whose patents or other intangible property have zero value at death but a far higher value in the years to come. Sarah T. Connolly, a partner at Nixon Peabody in Boston, said she dealt with many professors at the cutting edge of research who held patents that might be worth something only if others built on their work. She calls these ""building blocks."" ""Say our decedent has block 'E' and he knows it's going to be important one day,"" she said. ""It doesn't have any value on the date of death, but it could explode in the future if someone comes up with blocks A to D and F to J."" As long as people list that asset -- and the I.R.S. does not challenge the value assigned to it before the three-year statute of limitation has expired -- then they should be fine, Ms. Connolly said. The mistake people make is not listing something in the estate tax filing, which could open them up to an I.R.S. audit after the statute of limitations because they filed an incomplete report. Yet there are areas where the I.R.S. is more understanding with taxpayers. One is when it allows a so-called blockage discount. Mr. Behrendt said one of the best known cases involved David Smith, the sculptor, who had 425 pieces of his own work when he died in 1965. Had they all been sold at once, their value would have been far less, so the I.R.S. allowed a lower valuation. This can also apply to people who own large blocks of publicly traded stock. ""I've seen it happen a couple of times with Berkshire Hathaway stock,"" Mr. Behrendt said. ""It trades over $100,000 a share. If you had 100 shares, it's going to be tough to sell, so you get a lack of marketability discount.""

That discount is generally 3 to 5 percent, he said. The same holds true for a minority interest in a business or even a rental property, which would be valued lower because of lack of control. More difficult still would be valuing a collection. Ms. Erb said her father had a room filled with Coca-Cola memorabilia. ""It's not worth what you think it is or even what you paid for it,"" she said. ""You'd have to find a niche buyer, and no one is walking around saying: 'You know what I want? A room filled with Coca-Cola stuff.' "" Yet she said she would advise someone with an obscure collection to get it valued for estate tax purposes and to establish a basis for when the items would be sold. Some figure they can coax an appraiser into lowering a valuation for them, but the I.R.S. has gotten wise to that. Mr. Behrendt said that when he was an auditor in the 1990s, the value of lake properties in Wisconsin was exploding but their valuations on estate tax returns remained low. So he called a local appraiser and asked, ""Can you do something on the low end for me?"" Mr. Behrendt said the appraiser replied: ""Oh, sure. I do that all the time."" The I.R.S. now has penalties for appraisers who come in with artificially low valuations. But for people needing a valuation for an estate -- or other purposes, like a divorce or a business lawsuit -- skimping on a qualified appraiser carries risks. Chris M. Mellen, president of Delphi Valuation Advisors, pointed out that three of the 11 adequate-disclosure regulations had to do with establishing the credentials of the appraiser to even assign a value to something. ""If you don't follow all of the adequate-disclosure rules and the I.R.S. catches a technicality, then the statute of limitations is gone and the client could be audited past Year 3,"" Mr. Mellen said. ""You need to know the rules of the game, given the purposes of the valuations."" If the appraiser doesn't, the other side could prevail -- without any negotiation.","The unknowable vagaries of time can complicate the appraisal of the assets in an estate — and yet appraise you must, or risk incurring penalties from the I.R.S.",03516a24-31c0-58c4-a906-60ca04623bb3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/28/business/Wealth1/Wealth1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=273&w=600&s=cab3193a439ea694f2f6125a16312a2de676fe114d3a8de114a7dbdf16c4e27c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"J. D.

Science,"Dr. Wayne Bardin, 85, Innovative Researcher on Birth Control, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/science/dr-wayne-bardin-dead.html,"He helped develop long-acting implanted contraceptive devices -- like Norplant, Jadelle and Mirena -- used by millions of women around the world.

Dr. C. Wayne Bardin, a groundbreaking researcher in reproductive physiology, who was instrumental in the development of long-acting contraceptive methods -- like Norplant, Jadelle and Mirena -- used by millions of women around the world, died on Oct. 10 at his home in Manhattan. He was 85. His wife, Beatrice Bardin, confirmed the death without specifying a cause. An endocrinologist, Dr. Bardin was passionate about finding ways for women to take control of their own health. While working for the nonprofit research organization the Population Council -- as director of its Center for Biomedical Research and chairman of its International Committee for Contraception Research -- he oversaw clinical trials in the mid-1990s that led to the approval of mifepristone, or RU-486, a synthetic steroid used as part of the so-called ""abortion pill"" to terminate a pregnancy. When Dr. Bardin joined the Population Council in the late 1970s, the birth-control pill had been around for nearly two decades, but it provided only short-term contraception; women had to remember to take it regularly. And long-acting contraceptives, like intrauterine devices, or IUDs, which were developed in the early 1900s, were difficult to insert and remove and could have severe side effects. Many women who used them experienced cramps, infections and heavy bleeding. One IUD, the Dalkon Shield, was linked in the 1970s to incidences of pelvic inflammatory disease and even death, casting a shadow over the entire market.

Dr. Bardin resolved to invest in new ""bench to bedside"" research -- where the results of laboratory work are used directly on patients -- to develop better contraceptive drugs and delivery systems. ""As much as he respected basic research, Dr. Bardin really wanted to see products that would change people's lives come to fruition,"" said James Sailer, the current executive director of the Center for Biomedical Research, in New York City. Dr. Bardin was part of a research team led by Sheldon J. Segal that developed Norplant, a tiny device in which six silicon rods the size of matchsticks, surgically implanted under the skin of the upper arm, release small amounts of the female hormone progestin every day. The hormone prevented pregnancy by thickening cervical mucus, making it impenetrable by sperm, and stopping the regular release of eggs for up to five years. It was one of the first significant advances in long-acting contraceptives since the Dalkon Shield disaster. Introduced in 1991, Norplant was hailed as a welcome alternative to birth-control pills. ""Once it was put in, women didn't need to remember to take medication every day,"" Elizabeth Watkins, who studies the history of contraceptives at the University of California, San Francisco, said in a phone interview. ""You could set it and forget it."" But Norplant, too, turned out to have unwanted side effects. Some women complained of unpredictable bleeding, Dr. Watkins said; others experienced weight gain and hair loss. Many doctors and Planned Parenthood clinics declined to stock the device because of its cost ($365 per kit, plus about $500 more for the insertion -- totaling, in today's money, about $1,250). Moreover, they said, they could treat more women with birth-control pills, which presented fewer side effects.

From 1991 to 1994, legislators in many states proposed ways to incentivize the use of Norplant among welfare recipients, or even force them to use it, hoping that if women on welfare had fewer children, government costs would be reduced. None of these proposals became law, but the increasing controversy surrounding Norplant led its manufacturer, Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories (now Wyeth Pharmaceuticals) to take it off the market in 2002. It was never re-introduced. Seeking a successor to Norplant, Dr. Bardin and his team developed an implanted delivery system manufactured by Schering Oy under the name Jadelle. Jadelle uses just two silicon rods, in contrast to Norplant's six, to release a form of progestin. The federal Food and Drug Administration approved the device, initially as a means to prevent pregnancies for three years, a period that was later increased to five years, but in the wake of the Norplant controversy the manufacturer decided to market it only outside the United States. A few years later another contraceptive device that Dr. Bardin and others developed at the Population Council was approved by the F.D.A. and introduced by Berlex Laboratories (now Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals) as Mirena, an IUD that emits a progestin for five years. He also oversaw the development of Nestorone, a novel progestin that is released for up to a year through an easy-to-use vaginal ring, also developed by the researchers, that women could insert and remove themselves. The device was approved by the F.DA. under the brand name Annovera in 2018. Dr. Bardin's research for the Population Council also helped scientists understand how mifepristone, or RU-486, works to abort a pregnancy. A synthetic steroid, RU-486 blocks the action of progesterone and prompts the uterus to shed its lining. It becomes what is known as the ""abortion pill"" when used in combination with misoprostol, which causes contractions. The F.D.A. approved RU-486 in 2000. Dr. Bardin paved the way for successful research into male contraceptives as well. ""There has been a lot of skepticism around whether men would ever use a contraceptive, but Dr. Bardin saw it as an obvious unmet need,"" said Mr. Sailer, of the Center for Biomedical Research.","He helped develop long-acting implanted contraceptive devices — like Norplant, Jadelle and Mirena — used by millions of women around the world.",18a43b13-2958-5dd0-9641-679e308d0b61,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/15/obituaries/15Bardin1/13Bardin1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a331e2d12f4b18ef7faa53c1030a3b5e1997e42ed269b5cdc9ab7a41d969d7ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Dr. C.

Science,The Mystery of the Himalayas' Skeleton Lake Just Got Weirder,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/20/science/skeleton-lake-archaeology-roopkund.html,"Nestled in the Indian Himalayas, some 16,500 feet above sea level, sits Roopkund Lake. One hundred and thirty feet wide, it is frozen for much of the year, a frosty pond in a lonely, snowbound valley. But on warmer days, it delivers a macabre performance, as hundreds of human skeletons, some with flesh still attached, emerge from what has become known as Skeleton Lake. Who were these individuals, and what befell them? One leading idea was that they died simultaneously in a catastrophic event more than 1,000 years ago. An unpublished anthropological survey from several years ago studied five skeletons and estimated they were 1,200 years old. But a new genetic analysis carried out by scientists in India, America and Germany has upended that theory. The study, which examined DNA from 38 remains, indicates that there wasn't just one mass dumping of the dead, but several, spread over a millennium. The report, published Tuesday in Nature Communications, has led to a ""far richer view into the possible histories of this site"" than previous efforts provided, said Jennifer Raff, a geneticist and anthropologist at the University of Kansas who was not involved with the work.

[Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Anthropologists have known about Roopkund Lake for several decades, but little was known about the provenance of its skeletons. Rockslides, migrating ice and even human visitors have disturbed and moved the remains, making it difficult to decipher when and how the individuals were buried, much less who they were. ""In a case like this, that becomes impossible,"" said Cat Jarman, a bioarchaeologist at the University of Bristol in England who was not part of the research team. Genetic analysis has helped make some sense of the jumble of bones. The researchers, led in part by Niraj Rai, an expert in ancient DNA at the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences in India, and David Reich, a geneticist at Harvard University, extracted DNA from the remains of dozens of skeletal samples, and managed to identify 23 males and 15 females. Based on populations living today, these individuals fit into three distinct genetic groups. Twenty-three , including males and females, had ancestries typical of contemporary South Asians; their remains were deposited at the lake between the 7th and 10th centuries , and not all at once. Some skeletons were more ancient than others, suggesting that many were interred at the lake lifetimes apart.

How all these individuals met their end is anyone's guess. There's no evidence of bacterial infections, so an epidemic was probably not to blame. Perhaps the challenging high-altitude environment proved fatal. The earlier study, of five skeletal samples, found three with unhealed compression fractures , perhaps inflicted by huge hailstones , although that conclusion is open to debate. In any case, across a range of centuries ""it's hard to believe that each individual died in exactly the same way,"" said Eadaoin Harney, a doctoral student at Harvard and the lead author on the study. The individuals included children and elderly adults, but none were family relatives. Chemical signatures from the skeletons indicate that the individuals had significantly different diets, adding support to the notion that several distinct population groups are represented. If accounts of their journeys exist somewhere, none have been uncovered so far. ""We have searched all the archives, but no such records were found,"" said Dr. Rai. The researchers note that Roopkund Lake is situated on a route known to modern-day Hindu pilgrims , so perhaps some of the South Asian individuals died while taking part. But that is less likely to explain the presence of individuals from the distant eastern Mediterranean. Perhaps they weren't actually Mediterranean migrants, Dr. Jarman said. Their genetic ancestry resembles that of present-day people from Greece or Crete, but current distribution may not apply to ancient populations. Regardless, this group came from somewhere far from Roopkund Lake, for reasons unknown. Maybe the site held significance for groups with various religious beliefs, said Dr. Jarman. Maybe some of the skeletons were brought for burial, possibly to be left in the lake. Or maybe there were ill-fated explorers -- driven by a desire to see a spectacular mountain range, killed by their own curiosity.","Every summer, hundreds of ancient bones emerge from the ice.

Fashion & Style,Costume National and John Varvatos Reach for Rock 'n' Roll,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/19/fashion/costume-national-and-john-varvatos-milan-mens-fashion-week-2015.html,"MILAN -- A recurring beef a person who writes about style and fashion might develop is the lazy reference designers inevitably make to rockers. Depending on who you're consulting, rock 'n' roll has been around for a good 70 years. That's a lot of music. When someone like Ennio Capasa of Costume National, a decent man and equally so a designer, cites rock musicians as his inspiration, a listener is often left to wonder which ones: the Rolling Stones, the Kills, the Pretenders, the White Stripes, Sleater-Kinney? A lot of collections here have used Jimi Hendrix samples or Bob Dylan for background music -- both stellar examples of rock musicians who blessed the world with their musical genius and their not-inconsiderable style. Mr. Capasa's show was supported by a soundtrack created by the fine D.J. Sebastien Perrin and that had the effect of making you want to head for a club immediately and start to dance.

The show produced a different reaction. Inspired by the designer's recent time in Los Angeles collaborating with the performance artist Marina Abramovic, the Costume National presentation seemed like a fine example of what can be produced with access to good Italian tailoring and a few zippers and grommets. But rock?

Except that the casting included the weirdly compelling 18-year-old Irish model Liam Gardner, whose eye-covering bangs call to mind -- at least for those of a dinosaur generation -- the sadly forgotten musical tyro Skip Spence, of the brilliant Bay Area psychedelic band Moby Grape, the clothes were largely generic: double-breasted fingertip length coats, check; skinny leather jeans, check; shoes with Cuban heels rendered as a wedge. All right, that's a novel idea. In truth, it is not entirely fair to say of Mr. Spence that history misplaced him. In 2003, the novelist William Gibson published a lavish, almost fetishistic, appreciation of the musician's jeans in the fanzine Ugly Things. The essay was republished recently in an anthology from Another Man magazine. Despite the tumult of his personal life (he was a heroin addict), Mr. Spence was a style avatar around which any designer who can manage Google Images might easily build a career.

So, for that matter, were the other members of the band. Despite that, perhaps the sole designer and rock fan who has ever referenced Moby Grape is Anna Sui. And she does women's wear. Oh, well. John Varvatos similarly, and with the passion of a true fan, invokes rockers as his influence almost every season. Aside from the obligatory Tom Petty toppers in his show -- held Saturday evening in an underground space near a vast development erected to coincide with Expo Milano 2015 -- Mr. Varvatos's references to rock were largely limited to designs purportedly inspired by Richard Avedon photos of Dylan ambling moodily through Central Park circa ""Sad-Eyed Lady of the Lowlands.""

The stretch leather jeans, the hand-stained suede jackets, the shearlings and motorbike jackets fell well within the design idiom on which Mr. Varvatos has built a successful career and thriving business. Yet a guitar case carried as an accessory hardly telegraphs a rock 'n' roll spirit. To achieve his intended effect, Mr. Varvatos might consider taking a page from a glorious proto-punk band, MC5. Let go of your inhibitions. Remember what truly inspired you to be rock 'n' roll in the first place. Kick out the jams.","Lots of designers say they are inspired by rockers, but few really seem to understand them.",9868e191-889e-54c1-9613-9b7fc4325699,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/19/fashion/19costume-A/19costume-A-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=960d1b623fe16a87fe8873a0b816889b80f0882c1ccc5917862b46f75425e22b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"On the runway for Costume National, the Irish model Liam Gardner.",9868e191-889e-54c1-9613-9b7fc4325699,N24News/imgs/9868e191-889e-54c1-9613-9b7fc4325699.jpg,19
Global Business,European Central Bank Keeps Rates at Record Lows,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/05/business/global/05rates.html,"LONDON  With the economic recovery showing some resilience in Europe, the Bank of England and the European Central Bank left their main interest rates at record lows on Thursday. The Bank of England decided against any new stimulus measures for Britain, a day after the Federal Reserve moved to buy an additional $600 billion in government bonds to strengthen the United States economy. The British bank left its bond purchasing program at PS200 billion, or $322 billion, and its main interest rate at 0.5 percent. And the president of the European Central Bank, Jean-Claude Trichet, indicated at a news conference Thursday in Frankfurt that the Fed's move would not force the bank to change its monetary strategy, adding that the current rate at 1 percent was ""appropriate."" Unlike the United States, Europe continues to experience some growth momentum. While the American economy has stumbled amid uncertainty about the housing market, and as consumers remain reluctant to spend, relatively strong growth in Germany, Europe's biggest economy, more than made up for weaker growth in countries like Spain and Ireland. Germany mainly benefited from rising demand for its exports, made more attractive by a drop in the euro.

Mr. Trichet said that a ""positive underlying momentum,"" helped by continued demand for Europe's exports, ""remains in place"" for the euro zone. Still he said that, despite the encouraging developments, ""uncertainties are remaining."" He mentioned the ""re-emergence of tensions in financial markets"" and possible increases in the prices of oil and other commodities. Growth in the 16-country euro zone has allowed the central bank to effectively tighten monetary policy by gradually withdrawing the low-interest loans it provided to banks that were short of cash. Some economists warned that another round of government debt purchases, or quantitative easing, by the Federal Reserve could prove to be a roadblock for Europe's recovery by lifting the euro and the pound against the dollar and pushing up commodity prices. Mr. Trichet said Thursday that he had no reason to believe that the United States was ""playing the strategy of a weak dollar."" But Julian Callow, chief European economist at Barclays Capital in London, said that ""the E.C.B.'s task is clearly complicated considerably by the Fed's action.""

""It could push up global asset prices and commodities,"" which could fuel inflation, and ""the E.C.B. is likely to be more concerned that the Fed could end up pushing the dollar down too far at this stage,"" Mr. Callow said. The Bank of England considered expanding purchases of government debt last month, but positive economic data released since then eased pressure for it to act. The services sector, including banks and airlines, and manufacturing reported unexpected growth in October, and growth of Britain's gross domestic product beat economists' forecasts in the third quarter. The Bank of England would find it ""hard to justify further purchases without some evidence,"" Jens Larsen, chief European economist at RBC Capital Markets in London and a former Bank of England official, said. ""The rebound has been pretty robust and inflation has surprised us on the upside,"" he said. ""At the same time there are clearly some big risks facing the economy. Quantitative easing is not off the table."" The main risk for Britain's sustained recovery is the government's austerity program, which is expected to affect consumers beginning early next year. An increase in sales tax combined with deep cuts in government spending, including the elimination of an estimated 490,000 jobs, might slow the recovery despite the recent encouraging signs. Signs that consumers hold back on spending because of job uncertainty have already been seen. Sales at Next, one of the biggest clothing retailers in Britain, fell in the third quarter, and the company expects the last three months of the year to be more difficult. Last month, house prices fell the most since January 2009, as buyers postponed investments and more property came to the market.

Many economists expect Bank of England policy makers to postpone any decision on more stimulus until next year, when the impact of the largest spending cuts since World War II becomes clearer. Britain's opposition Labour Party has warned that the private sector might not be able to fill the gap and that spending cuts that are too extensive risk a recession. At the same time, inflation remains well above the Bank of England's target of 2 percent, making it harder for policy makers to argue for pumping more capital into the economy. But many economists expect interest rates to remain unchanged for at least six months, and the Bank of England has said that it expected inflation to drop by 2012.

Opinion,"What We, the Taliban, Want",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/20/opinion/taliban-afghanistan-war-haqqani.html,"When our representatives started negotiating with the United States in 2018, our confidence that the talks would yield results was close to zero. We did not trust American intentions after 18 years of war and several previous attempts at negotiation that had proved futile. Nevertheless, we decided to try once more. The long war has exacted a terrible cost from everyone. We thought it unwise to dismiss any potential opportunity for peace no matter how meager the prospects of its success. For more than four decades, precious Afghan lives have been lost every day. Everyone has lost somebody they loved. Everyone is tired of war. I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop. We did not choose our war with the foreign coalition led by the United States. We were forced to defend ourselves. The withdrawal of foreign forces has been our first and foremost demand. That we today stand at the threshold of a peace agreement with the United States is no small milestone.

Even when President Trump called off the talks, we kept the door to peace open because we Afghans suffer the most from the continuation of the war. No peace agreement, following on the heels of such intensive talks, comes without mutual compromises. That we stuck with such turbulent talks with the enemy we have fought bitterly for two decades, even as death rained from the sky, testifies to our commitment to ending the hostilities and bringing peace to our country. We are aware of the concerns and questions in and outside Afghanistan about the kind of government we would have after the foreign troops withdraw. My response to such concerns is that it will depend on a consensus among Afghans. We should not let our worries get in the way of a process of genuine discussion and deliberation free for the first time from foreign domination and interference.

I am confident that, liberated from foreign domination and interference, we together will find a way to build an Islamic system in which all Afghans have equal rights, where the rights of women that are granted by Islam -- from the right to education to the right to work -- are protected, and where merit is the basis for equal opportunity. We are also aware of concerns about the potential of Afghanistan being used by disruptive groups to threaten regional and world security. But these concerns are inflated: Reports about foreign groups in Afghanistan are politically motivated exaggerations by the warmongering players on all sides of the war. It is not in the interest of any Afghan to allow such groups to hijack our country and turn it into a battleground. We have already suffered enough from foreign interventions. We will take all measures in partnership with other Afghans to make sure the new Afghanistan is a bastion of stability and that nobody feels threatened on our soil. We are conscious of the immense challenges ahead. Perhaps our biggest challenge is to ensure that various Afghan groups work hard and sincerely toward defining our common future. I am confident that it is possible. If we can reach an agreement with a foreign enemy, we must be able to resolve intra-Afghan disagreements through talks. Another challenge will be keeping the international community interested and positively engaged during the transition to peace and after the withdrawal of foreign troops. The support of the international community will be crucial to stabilizing and developing Afghanistan. We are ready to work on the basis of mutual respect with our international partners on long-term peace-building and reconstruction. After the United States withdraws its troops, it can play a constructive role in the postwar development and reconstruction of Afghanistan. We acknowledge the importance of maintaining friendly relations with all countries and take their concerns seriously. Afghanistan cannot afford to live in isolation. The new Afghanistan will be a responsible member of the international community.

We will remain committed to all international conventions as long as they are compatible with Islamic principles. And we expect other countries to respect the sovereignty and stability of our country and consider it as a ground for cooperation rather than competition and conflict. More immediately, there will be the challenge of putting into effect our agreement with the United States. A degree of trust has been built through our talks with the American negotiators in Doha, Qatar, but just as the United States does not trust us completely, we too are very far from fully trusting it. We are about to sign an agreement with the United States and we are fully committed to carrying out its every single provision, in letter and spirit. Achieving the potential of the agreement, ensuring its success and earning lasting peace will depend on an equally scrupulous observance by the United States of each of its commitments. Only then can we have complete trust and lay the foundation for cooperation -- or even a partnership -- in the future. My fellow Afghans will soon celebrate this historic agreement. Once it is entirely fulfilled, Afghans will see the departure of all foreign troops. As we arrive at this milestone, I believe it is not a distant dream that we will soon see the day when we will come together with all our Afghan brothers and sisters, start moving toward lasting peace and lay the foundation of a new Afghanistan. We would then celebrate a new beginning that invites all our compatriots to return from their exile to our country -- to our shared home where everybody would have the right to live with dignity, in peace.

Books,A Literary Guide to the Oscars,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/21/books/oscars-reading-guide.html,"Spike Lee's movie -- about a black police officer, Ron Stallworth, who infiltrates his local Ku Klux Klan chapter in the 1970s -- is adapted from Stallworth's memoir. ""BLACK KLANSMAN"" (Flatiron) details the detective's investigation and efforts to derail the organization, even managing to befriend David Duke. Linda Gordon's ""THE SECOND COMING OF THE KKK: The Ku Klux Klan of the 1920s and the American Political Tradition"" (Norton) is a sobering account of the group's history and role in society. The KKK exercised huge influence over local politics and everyday life, to a jaw-dropping degree; our reviewer said the book ""should be required reading.""

For a novel that deals with many of the movie's central themes, check out Maurice Carlos Ruffin's debut, ""WE CAST A SHADOW"" (One World). Set in the future, in a deeply racist American South, the story's narrator is a black lawyer who goes to extraordinary lengths to protect his biracial son from experiencing racism. Our reviewer said the book ""asks some of the most important questions fiction can ask, and it does so with energetic and acrobatic prose, hilarious wordplay and great heart.""

If you'd like to spend more time in Wakanda, the universe of ""Black Panther,"" check out Ta-Nehisi Coates's reprisal of the comic, illustrated by Brian Stelfreeze. In their first volume, ""A NATION UNDER OUR FEET"" (Marvel), a superhuman terrorist group is rattling the nation, and the leader T'Challa must lead the country through the uprising and help determine its future. For another fantastical, sprawling story set in Africa, look to Marlon James's new novel, ""BLACK LEOPARD, RED WOLF"" (Riverhead), the first of an expected trilogy that's been compared to ""Game of Thrones."" Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi's epic novel, ""KINTU"" (Transit Books) is set in present-day Uganda, and follows one family's efforts to evade a curse that's followed them for generations.

Barry Jenkins' film is based on James Baldwin's 1974 novel of the same name, and follows a young couple in 1970s New York whose lives are thrown into chaos when the man is wrongly imprisoned. If you'd like to explore more by Baldwin, consider his debut novel, ""GO TELL IT ON THE MOUNTAIN,"" the loosely autobiographical story of a man growing up in Harlem in the 1930s. For a more contemporary story, there's ""AN AMERICAN MARRIAGE"" (Algonquin) by Tayari Jones, which follows a young African-American couple ""on the come-up"" whose lives are upended after the husband is convicted of a rape he didn't commit. To understand the devastating effects of the mass incarceration of black men, look to James Forman Jr.'s ""LOCKING UP OUR OWN: Crime and Punishment in Black America"" (Farrar, Straus & Giroux). His book shows the role of black mayors, judges and police chiefs, taking office amid a surge in crime and drug addiction, in putting in place measures that would prove devastating for poor black neighborhoods.

In their novel ""THE NANNY DIARIES"" (St. Martin's Griffin), Emma McLaughlin and Nicola Kraus -- both former nannies themselves -- include plenty of hilarious details in their story of child care among wealthy Manhattanites. Don't let the title of Leila Slimani's novel deceive you: ""THE PERFECT NANNY"" (Penguin) is a chilling psychological thriller ripped right from the headlines, with a family's caretaker who snaps and kills the children. The book was named one of The Times's 10 Best Books of 2018. The author P. L. Travers wrote six Mary Poppins books, but was an intensely private woman.

Health,"2 New Ebola Vaccines Pass Important Early Test, Researchers Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/health/2-new-ebola-vaccines-pass-important-early-test-researchers-say.html,"Two new Ebola vaccines have passed an important test, protecting monkeys against the strain of the virus responsible for the current deadly outbreak, researchers reported on Wednesday. Only one dose was needed, and there were no apparent side effects. The vaccines have not yet been tested in people, but safety trials in healthy volunteers will probably begin early this summer, said Thomas W. Geisbert, an Ebola expert at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and the senior author of a report published on Wednesday in the journal Nature. Tests in nonhuman primates are an important step, because those animals are far more closely related to humans than are other lab animals. The study of the new vaccines involved 10 macaques. Eight were vaccinated, and two, as controls, were not. The vaccinated animals showed no signs of side effects from the vaccine, Dr. Geisbert said. On the 28th day after the vaccines were given, all the monkeys were injected with Ebola virus from the current outbreak. No vaccinated monkeys became ill, but the unvaccinated ones both died within a week.

The two new vaccines are improved versions of an older one that was licensed to Merck and is now being tested for efficacy in people in Liberia. The older vaccine can cause unpleasant side effects like fever and pain in joints and muscles. (Another vaccine, licensed to GlaxoSmithKline, is also being tested in West Africa, and has not had serious side effects.) The side effects of the vaccine licensed to Merck were not considered serious enough to block its use. But they could pose problems during an outbreak because they resemble early symptoms of Ebola, so patients with a fever soon after vaccination might have to be tested or even quarantined until it was determined whether they were infected or just having a reaction to the shot.  Michael Stravato for The New York Times ""I think these improved vaccines should fix that,"" Dr. Geisbert said in an email. The two newer vaccines are being made by Profectus BioSciences. The company's chief scientific officer, John Eldridge, said the company had received $55 million in recent months to work on Ebola vaccines from a consortium of government agencies that includes the National Institutes of Health and the Department of Defense. He said that Profectus was also working on another vaccine that would protect people against several strains of Ebola as well as Marburg, a related virus. None of the vaccines is likely to be approved much before 2017, he said. Several authors of the Nature report are scientists employed by Profectus. The study described in the report was paid for by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Texas Medical Branch.

The Merck and Profectus Ebola vaccines are made from vesicular stomatitis virus, or V.S.V., which causes a mouth disease in cattle but rarely infects people. Profectus specializes in vaccines based on V.S.V. In the Ebola vaccines, the stomatitis virus is genetically engineered to make a protein from the surface of the Ebola virus, which stimulates the immune system to recognize Ebola, fight if off and prevent infection. The side effects are caused by the stomatitis virus, which replicates in the bloodstream. In the newer vaccines the V.S.V. has been genetically altered further to attenuate it, meaning that it will not replicate as much or reach such high blood levels as the original. The lower levels reduce side effects but do not reduce the vaccine's ability to create immunity, Dr. Eldridge said. Half the monkeys in the study received a highly attenuated version, and the other half a less attenuated form. The two vaccines worked equally well, so Profectus plans to develop the more attenuated one, because it should be safer, Dr. Eldridge said. The 28-day period between vaccination and exposure to the virus was picked to match up with previous studies, so that results could be compared, but the vaccine probably starts working much sooner than that, Dr. Geisbert said. Future studies will try to find out just how quickly the vaccine works.",The vaccines protected monkeys from the virus that has killed thousands in Africa.

Opinion,There Used to Be Justice. Now We Have Bill Barr.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/opinion/barr-trump-rule-of-law.html,"Ms. Bazelon is a staff writer at The New York Times Magazine. Mr. Posner is a professor of law at the University of Chicago.



This week, more than 2,000 former officials of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. called on Attorney General William Barr to resign for dropping the prosecution of Michael Flynn, who had pleaded guilty to lying to the F.B.I. when he was President Trump's national security adviser. ""Subsequent events strongly suggest political interference in Flynn's prosecution,"" the former officials said in an open letter published online. They condemned Mr. Barr for having ""once again assaulted the rule of law,"" in light of his earlier decision to overrule career prosecutors and seek a lighter sentence than what they had recommended for another Trump associate, Roger Stone. It's easy to grow numb to the abuses of the Trump era. But Mr. Barr's intervention in the Flynn and Stone cases is a deviation even from the standards at the outset of Mr. Trump's presidency. The corrosion at the Justice Department from the beginning to the homestretch of Mr. Trump's first term illustrates a long-term problem of maintaining the independence of a department with unrivaled powers of investigation and prosecution. More troubling, as recent history has shown, there are no easy ways to rein in an attorney general whose loyalty to a president stands ahead of his fidelity to the rule of law.

Jeff Sessions, Mr. Trump's first attorney general, followed the advice of career professionals at the Justice Department by recusing himself from the F.B.I.'s investigation of the Trump campaign's ties to Russia in 2016. He did so because of his own meetings with Russia's ambassador while he was advising the campaign. Mr. Sessions's recusal opened the door for his deputy, Rod Rosenstein, to appoint the special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian campaign interference after Mr. Trump fired James Comey, the F.B.I. director. By doing so, Mr. Rosenstein allowed a federal investigation into the campaign of a sitting president to proceed. While Mr. Trump repeatedly inveighed against the Mueller investigation, its work continued, upholding a crucial norm of Justice Department independence, however uneasily. Then Mr. Barr became attorney general. Establishment figures in Washington hoped he would check Mr. Trump, given his deep experience in the Justice Department, including two years as attorney general under President George H.W. Bush. Instead, Mr. Barr muffled the impact of the special counsel's final report on Russian interference in the 2016 campaign by suggesting that it absolved Mr. Trump when it did not. A federal judge later called Mr. Barr's comments ""misleading"" and said ""his lack of candor"" about the report called into question his ""credibility."" Mr. Barr also opened a criminal investigation into the origins of the Russia investigation, despite the conclusion of his department's inspector general that the F.B.I. had adequate reason to proceed. His department declined to investigate the whistle-blower complaint about the president's phone call last July with President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. That decision led dozens of government inspectors general to warn that the Justice Department ""could seriously undermine the critical role whistle blowers play."" Then came Mr. Barr's interference in the long-running Stone and Flynn prosecutions, both times fulfilling Mr. Trump's stated desires and serving his political interests. The attorney general, whom the president hires and can fire, is supposed to advise the president and advance his or her policies. But he is also obligated to enforce the law impartially and not to use it to shield the president's allies or punish his enemies. After its inception in 1870, the Justice Department cycled between periods of cronyism and professionalism. The problem of cronyism was on full display in Watergate. President Richard Nixon's attorney general, John Mitchell, was jailed for his role in the scandal. Hoping to clean up the department, President Gerald Ford appointed Edward Levi, the president of the University of Chicago, who was widely regarded for his integrity. Mr. Levi boosted morale and professionalism at the Justice Department and reined in the F.B.I., whose abuses had badly tarnished the reputation of that agency.

But there was no guarantee that attorneys general who followed Mr. Levi would uphold his standards. So in 1978, Congress passed a law that created an independent counsel, whom the attorney general could authorize to investigate top executive-branch officials for wrongdoing. Because the counsel was chosen by a three-judge panel and could be removed only for cause, the counsel operated beyond the influence of the president and the attorney general. The law addressed the competing loyalties inherent in the job of attorney general by walling him or her off from certain investigations. But Congress let the law expire in 1999 as both parties tired of independent counsels they saw as abusing their powers. Without this external watchdog, the stage was set again for conflict between politics and the rule of law. John Ashcroft, George W. Bush's first attorney general, resisted some of the Bush administration's claims to broad executive power in the wake of Sept. 11. But Mr. Ashcroft's successor, Alberto Gonzales, was a longtime Bush crony who resigned after repeated battles with Congress raised questions about whether his responsibilities to the law took a back seat to his loyalty to Mr. Bush. President Barack Obama appointed an ally with his own professional reputation, Eric Holder, as his first attorney general, and a career prosecutor, Loretta Lynch, as his second. Ms. Lynch found herself mired in controversy for talking to former President Bill Clinton on an airport tarmac while his wife was under investigation for mishandling classified information. Ms. Lynch's breach seems minor now but led her to defer the decision whether to prosecute Hillary Clinton to the F.B.I. and her aides. The norm of independence held. Now we have Mr. Barr. The next president could reassert that standard by appointing someone in the mold of Edward Levi. But history suggests that too often presidents prefer an attorney general whom they can control. Will Congress be able to step in? Not fully, it seems. Democrats in the House investigated Mr. Trump's dealings with Ukraine when Mr. Barr's Justice Department declined to do so, but they didn't have a clear path for compelling witnesses to testify, as a prosecutor would. And if the attorney general is willing to drop charges against an executive-branch official like Mr. Flynn, who lied to the F.B.I., then what's to stop him from refusing to prosecute officials who lie to Congress? This week, the Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases about whether Congress can subpoena the president's tax returns. The back-and-forth hinted that the court could erect new barriers for Congress when it seeks to keep the executive in check. This suggests that Congress erred by allowing the independent counsel statute to expire. The potential that political considerations could warp decisions by the president and attorney general require this extra check on the executive branch. The best way to stop the downward spiral of the Justice Department is to protect it from its own boss.

Health,New Injection Method Makes an Old TB Vaccine Far More Powerful,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/health/tuberculosis-vaccine.html,"New Injection Method Makes an Old TB Vaccine Far More Powerful

In the constant search for a vaccine against tuberculosis -- which now kills more people around the world than any other infectious disease -- researchers have made an unusual discovery. In tests on monkeys, they found that an almost century-old vaccine routinely given to infants in many countries is far more protective when injected into a vein rather than by the normal route, just under the skin. Injecting the vaccine into a vein completely protected nine of 10 monkeys who were exposed to large doses of live TB germs six months later, according to the study. The research was led by scientists from the University of Pittsburgh's medical school and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and published Wednesday by the journal Nature. Although routine childhood vaccinations are not generally injected into a vein, an experimental malaria vaccine delivered that way has been successfully given to hundreds of children in Africa, so it is theoretically possible, the authors said.

At the same time, all the experts warned that rigorous safety testing would be needed before live bacteria can be injected into human bloodstreams. Even the weakened bacteria used in vaccines can be dangerous for people with H.I.V. BCG vaccine, like most vaccines made with live weakened virus, is not given to pregnant women, although it has not been shown to harm fetuses. In parts of Africa and Asia, H.I.V. often circulates in populations at high risk of tuberculosis, so the potential that someone with undiagnosed H.I.V. could be killed by the vaccine would be high, experts said. Researchers also still need to determine how long the protection lasts, since the monkeys were tested after only six months. Also, tuberculosis research in the 1960s showed that injecting just the cell walls of bacteria worked almost as well as injecting whole bacteria. ""If cell walls can be tweaked to be as protective, this would be a lot better,"" said Dr. Lalita Ramakrishnan, a tuberculosis researcher at the University of Cambridge, because cell walls could not reproduce in someone with a weak immune system. In rare instances, the vaccine has caused severe reactions in cancer patients. In four cases described in medical literature, Dr. Ramakrishnan said, BCG vaccine was intravenously injected into cancer patients -- either accidentally or deliberately. One patient died, one had to be treated with anti-tuberculosis drugs, and two suffered anaphylactic reactions but recovered.

The Nature study tested different ways to deliver the BCG vaccine to six groups of rhesus macaques, which are even more susceptible to TB than people. The first group got the standard dose by the normal skin injection route, a second got a much stronger dose, a third inhaled a vaccine-containing mist, a fourth got both injection and mist, and a fifth got the stronger dose by vein. The sixth, the control group, got no vaccine. After six months, only the monkeys injected intravenously were well protected. ""The effects were amazing,"" said JoAnne L. Flynn, a microbiologist at the Pitt Center for Vaccine Research and co-author of the study. Not only did nine of 10 monkeys who got the vaccine injected in their veins show no lung inflammation, she said, but they had 100,000 times fewer TB bacteria in their lungs. Dr. Robert A. Seder, chief of cellular immunology at the N.I.A.I.D. and a co-author, said he believed that getting the bacteria directly to the lungs and lymph nodes primed reservoirs of white blood cells in those tissues to mount a powerful, long-lasting immune response. Dr. Seder had proposed testing the new injection method for the TB vaccine because he had used the same method in developing an experimental malaria vaccine made with irradiated parasites. Venous injection let the parasites travel directly to the liver, where they primed white blood cells, he said. For those studies, he said, intravenous injections were safely given to thousands of people in six African countries, some as young as five months old.

Although BCG is given to infants, the most likely eventual target group for intravenous administration would be children about 10 years old, Dr. Flynn and Dr. Seder said, because they have more mature immune systems. Also, for unknown reasons, tuberculosis tends to attack infants but not young children, and then attack again at puberty and in the early years of adulthood. ""In the U.S. we think of TB as an old people's disease,"" Dr. Flynn said. ""But in the rest of the world, it's mostly one of young adults."" Scientists have been working for decades to make a powerful, long-lasting vaccine. Recently, a new candidate from GSK showed itself to be about 50 percent protective in humans. But it was tested for its ability to keep people with latent tuberculosis from developing active disease, not for protecting people never previously exposed to TB -- as was done with the monkeys -- and might work differently, Dr. Seder said. Intravenous administration of BCG vaccine has been tried before. In the late 1960s, researchers tested the idea on a few monkeys and found it to be highly protective. But for unknown reasons, they did not pursue that route. The chief authors of those studies, Dr. William R. Barclay and Edgar E. Ribi, have since died. In the introduction to a later study, Dr. Seder said, they described intravenous injection of vaccines as ""impractical"" for humans and instead endorsed giving BCG by aerosol mist. That idea was never adopted either, and it did not work well in the current study.",Giving the vaccine intravenously to monkeys provided 90% protection against tuberculosis. More testing is needed before humans can be inoculated that way.,8668f9d1-4cf4-560b-b66a-ded843470a53,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/science/01TUBERCULOSIS/01TUBERCULOSIS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=551&w=1050&s=845c22fb8b9113d55a3c14cc63327e86fd78540dca595686789e2d7e63c64195&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In these PET scans of monkey lungs, the yellow and red highlight inflammation from TB infection.

Technology,Apple Removes Apps From China Store That Help Internet Users Evade Censorship,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/29/technology/china-apple-censorhip.html,"HONG KONG -- China appears to have received help on Saturday from an unlikely source in its fight against tools that help users evade its Great Firewall of internet censorship: Apple. Software made by foreign companies to help users skirt the country's system of internet filters has vanished from Apple's app store on the mainland. One company, ExpressVPN, posted a letter it had received from Apple saying that its app had been taken down ""because it includes content that is illegal in China."" Another tweeted from its official account that its app had been removed. A search on Saturday showed that a number of the most popular foreign virtual-private networks, also known as VPNs, which give users access to the unfiltered internet in China, were no longer accessible on the company's app store there.

ExpressVPN wrote in its blog that the removal was ""surprising and unfortunate."" It added, ""We're disappointed in this development, as it represents the most drastic measure the Chinese government has taken to block the use of VPNs to date, and we are troubled to see Apple aiding China's censorship efforts."" Sunday Yokubaitis, president of Golden Frog, a company that makes privacy and security software including VyprVPN, said its software, too, had been taken down from the app store. ""We gladly filed an amicus brief in support of Apple in their backdoor encryption battle with the F.B.I.,"" he said, ""so we are extremely disappointed that Apple has bowed to pressure from China to remove VPN apps without citing any Chinese law or regulation that makes VPN illegal."" He added, ""We view access to internet in China as a human rights issue, and I would expect Apple to value human rights over profits."" In a statement, Apple noted that the Chinese government announced this year that all developers offering VPNs needed to obtain a government license. ""We have been required to remove some VPN apps in China that do not meet the new regulations,"" the company said. ""These apps remain available in all other markets where they do business.""

This is not the first time that Apple has removed apps at the request of the Chinese government, but it is a new reminder of how deeply beholden the tech giant has become to Beijing at a moment when the leadership has been pushing to tighten its control over the internet. The removals signal a new push by China to control the internet. In the past, the Great Firewall has used technology to disrupt VPNs, and Beijing has shut down Chinese VPNs and even aimed a huge cyberattack at a well-known foreign site hosting code that circumvented the filters. But they also mark the first time China has successfully used its influence with a major foreign tech platform, like Apple, to push back against the software makers. While internet crackdowns often peak every five years, ahead of a key Chinese Communist Party congress, this year's efforts cover fresh ground, a likely indication that stricter controls of things like VPNs will persist after the congress this autumn. Earlier this month, China also began a partial block of the Facebook-owned messaging app WhatsApp. Greater China is Apple's largest market outside the United States. That has left the company more vulnerable than almost any other American technology firm to a Chinese campaign to wean itself off foreign technology and tighten control over foreign tech companies operating there. In response, Apple has made a number of moves to ensure that it stays on Beijing's good side. Last year, the company complied with what it said was a request from the Chinese authorities to remove from its China app store news apps created by The New York Times. This month, the company said it would open its first data center in China to comply with a new law that pushes foreign firms to store more of their data in China. Apple has operated its app store in China for many years with only the occasional run-in with the government. The VPN crackdown and Beijing's move in December to target news sites indicate that China's internet regulators have taken a deeper interest, and are exerting more control, over what is available on Apple's China app store.",The world's most valuable company appears to have pulled down the apps amid China's deepening crackdown on tools that evade internet controls.,07a1deda-dc0d-53d6-a2d3-6ace94a95369,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/31/business/apple-img/apple-img-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a525f499ed0eb78a86a39f821d168b500b711c41fc7f33e2e79564e0f3c2cd1b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Software made by foreign companies to help users skirt China's internet filters has vanished from Apple's app store on the mainland.,07a1deda-dc0d-53d6-a2d3-6ace94a95369,N24News/imgs/07a1deda-dc0d-53d6-a2d3-6ace94a95369.jpg,20
Real Estate,Breaking Ground Where Echoes of Edison Linger in New Jersey,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/06/realestate/commercial/breaking-ground-where-echoes-of-edison-linger-in-new-jersey.html,"Renovations of the former Edison battery factory will include restoring its facade and replacing roughly 900 windows that wrap around the building.

WEST ORANGE, N.J. -- The facade of Thomas Edison's last factory in this town crumbles behind a chain-link fence on Main Street. The dilapidated building sits on several acres of fallow land, a sharp contrast to its state in 1914, when it was just one piece of the American inventor's formidable manufacturing operation. In the last few weeks, workers have begun restoring the 400,000-square-foot Edison Storage Battery factory, the first step in a $230 million redevelopment project. Called Edison Village, it is intended to transform 21 acres in this New York City suburb into a neighborhood with shops, parking and housing. The start of construction brings a decade of setbacks to a close, despite lingering concerns from some residents that the project might not deliver on its promise of renewal. West Orange, with 46,700 residents spread over 12.5 square miles, is about 20 miles from Manhattan. The first phase of the project will create about 330 rental apartments and bring 18,500 square feet of retail space, as well as parking and streetscape improvements to the complex. The site is opposite Edison's laboratory, which is now part of the Thomas Edison National Historic Park, where visitors can tour his home in nearby Llewellyn Park and learn about his inventions.

The second phase, with about 230 townhouses and 20,000 square feet of retail, which could include a small grocery store, according to the developer, will replace a CVS pharmacy and a Barton Press factory about a block from the battery factory. ""This is a big opportunity for the downtown to see some rebirth,"" said West Orange's mayor, Robert D. Parisi. ""Old downtowns are struggling to survive in a modern world.""

The town adopted a redevelopment plan for the area in 2003, and designated a redeveloper, Prism Capital Partners of Bloomfield, N.J., three years later. The original plan to build condos was derailed by the recession. The project hit another roadblock in 2012, when five West Orange residents filed a lawsuit challenging the town's decision to issue $6.3 million of municipal bonds to finance infrastructure improvements. Last December, the State Supreme Court upheld a lower-court ruling in favor of the town, clearing a path for redevelopment to begin. And in February, Prism secured a $70 million construction loan.

Like many older American suburbs, West Orange struggles to draw visitors to its aging downtown. Its Main Street winds along a mile-and-a-half-long stretch of houses, municipal buildings and offices interspersed with pockets of disconnected retail. It makes for an unwieldy stroll. The plan's critics oppose using public money to finance a private development that might not deliver sufficient revenue to a middle-class community burdened with high property taxes. An influx of new residents could strain public schools and worsen traffic on a congested artery, they say. ""I shudder to think about the impact of a failed project,"" said Joe Krakoviak, a member of the town council and a critic of the plan. Edison Village's detractors argue that the approval process was opaque, leaving questions about the viability of the plan. Among the concerns are that Edison Village is not within walking distance of a train station, unlike similar projects in other New Jersey suburbs, and that the nearest stop for a bus to Manhattan is about a half-mile walk. Prism, though, says it plans to offer shuttle service to a train station.

In its prime, the area around the factory, at Main Street and Lakeside Avenue, was a center of industry, not retail. At its peak, 10,000 workers toiled in dozens of buildings here. Around 850 of them worked in the four battery factory buildings, which made batteries for industrial uses like submarines and mining lamps. ""Many residents still tell me stories about their grandfathers who worked for Edison,"" said Joseph Fagan, a local historian. ""Edison helped place West Orange on the map.""

But by the 1960s, many of the American inventor's businesses had been spun off. The businesses slowly failed, said Leonard DeGraaf, an archivist at the Thomas Edison National Historical Park. ""That had an enormous impact on the community,"" he said. In the early 1970s, the factories were razed, except for the battery complex, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Mr. Parisi, who grew up near the factories and still lives in the neighborhood, remembers gathering with neighbors on the street as a young boy to watch the buildings implode. For days afterward, he and his friends climbed through the rubble, scouring for remnants of Edison's inventions and finding some of the wax cylinders that had been used for phonographs. Edison Village, with grounds open to the public during the day, is intended to usher into the downtown the new era of the American urban center. New retail will open in about a year and a half, bringing coffee shops and restaurants to a drab block that faces an auto body shop, a bar and some houses. The Edison factory, which will house nearly all of the apartments, will open in about two and a half years. Planned building renovations include restoring the facade and replacing the roughly 800 windows that wrap around the buildings, offering views of the neighboring brick laboratory and, in the distance, the New York City skyline.

The complex will have a pool, a fitness center and 20 penthouse duplex apartments. Asking rents for the loftlike apartments could start around $1,600 a month for a studio and $2,600 for a two-bedroom. Streetscape improvements will add lighting, replace sidewalks and move utility poles. Supporters of the project hope that the investment will draw other businesses and developers that might be reluctant to be the first to invest in downtown. ""Redevelopment is a powerful tool,"" said Eugene Diaz, a principal at Prism, which is developing the project with Dune Real Estate Partners and Greenfield Partners. ""It breeds confidence for people to take chances.""

Still, some residents are skeptical of the deal, particularly the decision to issue municipal bonds to finance the infrastructure work. Under a 30-year tax-alternative agreement, the mayor estimates that the town could receive as much as $1.188 million a year in payments from Prism, but only after the first phase of the development is fully occupied. At a minimum, it would receive $650,000 a year. The town now collects $465,683 in property taxes for the Edison site, Mr. Parisi said. A tax agreement has not yet been reached for the second phase of the project. Critics argue that the payment arrangement amounts to a substantial tax break for a project that will bring new residents who could strain schools and infrastructure. Property taxes are already high. Last year, the average residential tax bill was roughly $13,000, and the average home value was about $338,000. ""The taxpayers should not be subsidizing these guys,"" said Mark Meyerowitz, a plaintiff in the lawsuit against the town. ""It's just a bad deal for the citizens of West Orange."" Mr. Parisi said he expected that the development would not draw a large number of families with school-age children, arguing that such developments tend to appeal to young professionals and empty nesters. As for traffic, Ashland Avenue, a street that runs parallel to Main Street, will be extended during the second phase of the project, easing congestion. Ultimately, Mr. Parisi sees the alternative -- leaving a hulking eyesore in the middle of town -- as the greater risk. ""The goal,"" he said, ""was to revitalize a neighborhood."" Mr. Parisi added that increasing tax rolls was not the main objective. ""We have tried to do everything we can to roll out the red carpet for this type of development,"" he said.","Construction begins on Edison Village, a West Orange redevelopment project, despite concerns that it might not deliver on its promise of renewal.",c99c54c1-6db6-5810-8a40-616d34f6f589,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/04/05/business/06edison/06edison-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=314c34f5040fe026b91aac04c7b3230d86867d58509924967ef348ddf4c82a3b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Edison factory once made batteries for industrial uses like submarines and mining lamps.,c99c54c1-6db6-5810-8a40-616d34f6f589,N24News/imgs/c99c54c1-6db6-5810-8a40-616d34f6f589.jpg,7

They make them with workers' pants type of material and I have them in a cargo style. I got them at Kith in black and I also have them in olive green. They're very high quality, in a Japanese cut. I don't even really know what it means, but I always feel super-Japanese when I wear those pants because of the fit. They're the only pants that are comfortable when I wear them on my real waist.

Coat I'm a jacket collector. I have puffers and flights, which are bomber jackets. There's a dark green puffer with a yellow and red hood from Marni. I have no idea where I got it. I also have some cool bubbles by Fjallraven. I don't really care about brands. I just like what I like.

Shoes I go between my Danner boots and my yearly supply of Yeezy V2s -- I got the one with the tan stripe. The Danner boots are like combat boots. I like the comfort and the look. They're a good winter boot, but I'd wear them with pants in the summer, too.

Accessories I rotate between my two Rolex watches and my chains and my custom jewelry and my custom teeth by Toronto Grillz. For my custom jewelry, I go to my man in New York on 47th Street in the diamond district, Mr. Flawless. I met him through industry friends.

Fashion & Style,A Connection Was Made 'Within Seconds' of Their First Call,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/29/fashion/weddings/a-connection-was-made-within-seconds-of-their-first-call.html,"Because marriage is an ever-evolving experience, we constantly shift, change and, in some cases, start over. In It's No Secret, couples share thoughts about commitment and tell us what they have learned along the way, revealing their secret to making it work. Occupations Ms. Lewis is a former jingle writer turned real estate broker for the Corcoran Group; Ms. Sager is the director of listings at Citi Habitats. The couple married May 16, 2015 before more than 120 guests at the Down Town Association in Manhattan's Financial District. They were supposed to marry at Ramscale Studio, a loft space in the West Village, but the air-conditioner broke four days before the wedding. Ms. Sager's boss, Gary L. Malin, the president of Citi Habitats who became a Universal Life minister, officiated. Ms. Lewis's mother, who was too ill to attend, watched via FaceTime. The couple walked down the aisle to two versions of ""One Fine Day"" (by the Chiffons and Natalie Merchant). They live in Chelsea with their rescue hound, Mia. In 1998, Ms. Lewis got a call from a friend saying she was going to a bar with some gal pals; there was someone she wanted her to meet, a possible love interest. ""I was recently single,"" she said. ""I was dating a lot. When she told me Nancy was 40 I said, 'She's too old.'"" At the time Ms. Lewis was 39. ""I had a proclivity for younger people,"" she added.

Ms. Lewis stood her ground, but agreed to phone Ms. Sager the following day. ""Within five seconds we were joking and connected in sarcasm,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""It was as if we had known each other for years."" The call turned into meeting for a drink. The drink led to dinner two days later, which morphed into an overnight. Hours and hours of phone calls followed. ""We could talk until 1 or 3 in the morning,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""We would fall asleep on the phone. It never got old. I wanted to be with her from Day 1."" And so they were. Years went by, then a decade. Yet no proposal followed. ""I wasn't going to be the one to ask. I'd asked so many times,"" Ms. Lewis said. ""Nancy never wanted to marry."" Then on Valentine's Day 2015, Ms. Sager surprised Ms. Lewis by presenting her with a silver box. Inside were 17 hand-painted cards depicting something symbolic for each year they had been together. ""The last card was of a couple getting married with our faces superimposed over theirs. It was the most amazing proposal,"" she said. They were married three months later. Ms. Lewis My mother died shortly after our wedding. Marriage provided me with a sense of safety and family that helped with the profound loss. It made our connection even deeper and more beautiful.

The second I met Nancy, I knew her. It was love at first sight for me. Nancy is very funny, sharp and smart. She's beautiful inside and out. She's very succinct and precise; I'm very broad stroke and emotional. I'm better one on one; she's better in a crowd. I'm a sentimental pack rat; Nancy pares everything down to what she wants and needs. It's because of those differences that we have a successful relationship. We are each other's antidepressants. We encourage each other's positives and successes, and make up for each other's deficits.

We don't really argue. We recognize that we have differences. We don't agree on everything but we have learned to talk it out and agree to disagree. Usually one of us is feeling vulnerable that has nothing to do with the other person, and it splashes onto the relationship. Over the years, Nancy has become willing to step outside her comfort zone. She's more open. She can make things succinct and she simplifies the world in a way for me that I probably complicate for her. She's got an incredible heart, which she doesn't give away easily. It takes a long time to earn her trust and get to know her. Every day is a little bit of a challenge and that keeps me engaged. I've learned that I'm capable of a deep and lasting commitment, and sustaining interest in someone other than myself. Her challenges, joys and sadness are something I'm interested in, and invested in. Our relationship takes up space. It makes my small world feel expanded and large because I have this person to share it with, which is never boring. Ms. Sager I wasn't anti-marriage. To me, I was already in a committed relationship. But Laurie really wanted to get married, and I've learned if something matters to her, it matters to me. I've learned to be less selfish and stubborn. I tend to get into a bubble. Laurie reminds me I'm in a relationship and to be present. That I'm going through this journey with someone else. I love her for that. Laurie is a kind, gentle, compassionate person. She's loyal and dependable. She's smart and has a quick mind. And she's creative. She's poetic; I'm pragmatic. And that gets us to a middle ground that's positive and works.

If either of us is having a bad day we help each other laugh through it. That's become stronger over the years. She's made me grow in all my relationships. She's made me a better version of me. We've done that for each other. As different as we are, we have a lot of similarities: we both come from upper /middle class, Jewish backgrounds. She's from the suburbs of New York; I'm from the suburbs of Philadelphia. Our parents are from the same generation. We're both short, dark, and are the same age. We've experienced life at the same pace. We get the same cultural references. It's the same description; there's comfort in that. We were together for 17 years before we got married. We already had the power of two. But when you stand up and agree to spend the rest of our lives together, you become a force. Every morning we have a routine. It always starts with Laurie asking, 'Do you know what today is?' It's my job to answer it: 1,280 days or whatever number it is for the day. That's how many days we've been married. I never get bored of saying it. It's become part of us.","""We already had the power of two.

Art & Design,"Christo, Trump and the Art World's Biggest Protest Yet",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/arts/design/christo-protest-donald-trump-colorado-artwork.html,"With one dramatic no, a major artist has just escalated the culture world's war against Donald J. Trump. For more than 20 years, the artist Christo has worked tirelessly and spent $15 million of his own money to create a vast public artwork in Colorado that would draw thousands of tourists and rival the ambition of ""The Gates,"" the saffron transformation of Central Park that made him and Jeanne-Claude, his collaborator and wife, two of the most talked-about artists of their generation. But Christo said this week that he had decided to walk away from the Colorado project -- a silvery canopy suspended temporarily over 42 miles of the Arkansas River -- because the terrain, federally owned, has a new landlord he refuses to have anything to do with: President Trump.

His decision is by far the most visible -- and costly -- protest of the new administration from within the art world, whose dependence on ultra-wealthy and sometimes politically conservative collectors has tended to inhibit galleries, museums and artists from the kind of full-throated public disavowal of Mr. Trump expressed by some other segments of the creative world. Last week, the artist Richard Prince fired an opening salvo, returning a $36,000 payment for an artwork depicting Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, owned by her family.

The Christo project, titled ""Over the River,"" conceived with his wife, who died in 2009, has been fiercely opposed in state and federal court by a group of Coloradans who contend that it will endanger wildlife and cause other problems in Bighorn Sheep Canyon. Almost six miles of fabric panels were to be erected over the river for two weeks, at a cost that could have exceeded $50 million. Christo, who sells artwork depicting his proposed projects to pay for them completely on his own, has prevailed in every court battle and is awaiting a decision by a federal appeals court that would represent a final stand by opponents. But in an interview on Tuesday, he said that even if he won the case, he would no longer go forward with the work. ""I came from a Communist country,"" said Christo, 81, who was born Christo Vladimirov Javacheff in Bulgaria and moved to New York with Jeanne-Claude in 1964, becoming an American citizen in 1973. ""I use my own money and my own work and my own plans because I like to be totally free. And here now, the federal government is our landlord. They own the land. I can't do a project that benefits this landlord."" Asked to elaborate on his views of the new president, he said only, ""The decision speaks for itself."" He added, ""My decision process was that, like many others, I never believed that Trump would be elected.""

The establishment art world is slowly beginning to become more vocal about Mr. Trump, invoking the power of past protest movements, like the Art Workers Coalition, whose Moratorium of Art to End the War in Vietnam pressured museums to close for a day in October 1969, and led the next year to an Art Strike Against Racism, War and Oppression, which drew picketers to the Metropolitan Museum of Art because it declined to shut its doors. In late November, more than 150 prominent artists, curators and gallery workers picketed in front of the Puck Building in Downtown Manhattan, owned by the family of Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband and now a senior adviser to President Trump. Under the banner of a continuing social-media and protest movement called Dear Ivanka, critics of the President have directed almost daily condemnations of his actions and policies to his daughter, a prominent art collector. And on Inauguration Day, dozens of galleries -- and a few public art institutions -- closed in cities across the country as a part of a movement, J20, that plans to broaden protest activities in the coming months to address issues like racism, immigration and gentrification. Aesthetic refusal as a form of protest does not have universal support in the art world. Some see it as ineffective, a defeatist position that denies the power of expression itself to effect change. ""I would argue that this project, on a river that traverses both red and blue states, could draw attention to the importance of federal land management and stewardship of the environment,"" said Tom Eccles, the executive director of the Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College and former director of the Public Art Fund in New York. ""If anything, Christo's projects promote a sense of collective wonder, something we need more than ever right now.""

Hope Hicks, a spokeswoman for the White House, said it had no comment. Christo, whose work usually involves monumental wrapping or draping, a kind of beautifying abstraction of architecture or landscape, is known not only for ""The Gates,"" but also for highly visible projects like ""Wrapped Reichstag,"" in Berlin, realized in 1995 after more than 20 years of planning and proposals. Last year, ""The Floating Piers,"" a yellow-orange walkway of fabric atop 220,000 interlocking polyethylene cubes on Lake Iseo in the Lombardy region of Italy, drew 1.2 million visitors. The Colorado project would have been the largest work Christo had ever attempted in America. In interviews, he spoke about how the idea came about in 1985, during a project in which he and Jeanne-Claude had wrapped the Pont Neuf in Paris. ""We looked up at the fabric, and it was so beautiful, silvery and shimmering in the reflected light of the river, and we smiled at each other,"" he said. The two inspected dozens of rivers and selected a length of the Arkansas, partly because it was a popular rafting spot, and the canopied fabric, stretched over steel wire cables anchored on the banks, would be best seen from beneath, on the water itself. The project, expected to take more than two years to construct, was to remain in place for two weeks, during an August, before, like all of Christo and Jeanne-Claude's projects, being dismantled. In court, Christo argued that he had taken every step possible to prevent long-term damage to the river, land around it, or animal or plant life. The group that has opposed him, Rags Over the Arkansas River, or ROAR, has argued that the federal Bureau of Land Management, in approving the project, failed to take sufficiently into account its possible threat to bighorn sheep and the impact on traffic on U.S. Highway 50 through the canyon. On Wednesday, Joan Anzelmo, a spokeswoman for ROAR, said it was ""ecstatic"" to hear of the decision, no matter what the artist's reasons. ""This means local people will now be protected,"" she said, ""as well as wildlife, birds and fish."" In the interview on Tuesday, Christo said the Job-like patience required in seeking approval for his projects has always been an element of the spirit of the projects themselves. He needs to feel passion about them, in the same way that a more traditional painter or sculptor does, he added. But in this case, ""that pleasure is gone"" because of the nature of the new administration. ""I am not excited about the project anymore,"" he said. ""Why should I spend more money on something I don't want to do?""","The artist spent $15 million and more than 20 years on a vast artwork in Colorado to rival his masterpiece, ""The Gates.""

Books,Did America Use Bioweapons in Korea? Nicholson Baker Tried to Find Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/books/review/baseless-nicholson-baker.html,"BASELESS

My Search for Secrets in the Ruins of the Freedom of Information Act

By Nicholson Baker This has been a hard season for truth. Between the disinformation surrounding the coronavirus, Russian bots on the internet, police cover-ups of excessive force applied to unarmed civilians and the regular torrent of lies emanating from the White House, objective reality seems to be fading before our eyes. Nicholson Baker (no relation) now weighs in with ""Baseless,"" an account of his efforts to pry old secrets out of the C.I.A. through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), in the service of truth. Unfortunately, he only adds to the ball of confusion that is our world today. ""Baseless"" evolved from a seven-year quest by Baker to obtain classified Air Force memos on a secret government program called ""Project Baseless,"" which he thinks might reveal whether or not the United States used biological weapons during the Korean War. (The North Koreans claimed we did.) The pursuit becomes part of the story, as Baker exposes how the C.I.A. and the United States military have gutted much of FOIA one redaction at a time, stalling for years on releasing documents and trying to rebury what has been exposed already. Along the way, he dredges up many of the ""nasty, ugly, wrong things"" done by intelligence agencies and the military in our name, especially during the Cold War era. Baker's proposed policy solutions, including a vast increase in declassification and transparency, and the termination of the C.I.A. as we know it, are all to the good. The crimes the agency committed during the Cold War, particularly in Latin America -- subverting elections, running death squads and coups, even destroying food sources -- are some of the worst things this country has ever done.

Yet too often, Baker's search for the truth dissolves in his own prejudices and rampaging sense of moral superiority. ""Baseless"" is framed as a work diary he kept for three months in 2019, in which we are also treated to tidbits about his children, his wife, the two small dachshunds they adopted from the Humane Society in Bangor, Maine; the weather; what he's eating -- potatoes, a granola bar, bean soup, yellow lentils and ginger, noodles, ""a baked good from the cafeteria"" and ""a crunchy baked good""; as well as any number of grating maxims. (""Be a leaf tumbling and leaping around a gravestone. Don't be a gravestone."") Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Baker is making a case for himself as a man of small and virtuous pleasures. He goes to a Quaker meeting. He loves his wife and the warmth of her body in bed. He loves the feel of a paw in his hand, the smell of a laundry detergent that reminds him of his son.

By contrast, our leading Cold War wise men, with their ""deep crazy suspicions and enmities,"" are ""not normal people."" Baker can be slashingly funny about this ""tiny handful of unelected desk warriors,"" middle-aged men reveling in ""a form of treehouse, boy's-club, prep-school ugliness"" and their ""power to wage political war via cablegram in a suit and tie, and drop hints to newspaper columnists over cocktails in a Georgetown living room that same night."" Yet Baker smears even the likes of this establishment with what he chooses to ""redact"" on his own. His distortions, speculations and omissions outstrip any effort to note them all. Suffice it to say that in his view there is not a calamity anywhere in the world that was not caused by a United States government program. Baker wonders ""idly and perhaps unfairly"" whether a 1920s Department of Agriculture effort to eradicate barberry bush didn't make the Dust Bowl worse. (It didn't.) And he muses that ""Rabbit fever, Q fever, bird flu, Lyme tick disease, wheat stem rust, African swine fever and hog cholera all look, to my nonscientist's eye, like unnatural epidemics that owe their outbreaks to the laboratory"" -- an American laboratory, that is.

To my nonscientist's eye. Similar caveats -- ""we may never have incontrovertible proof,"" ""it's remotely possible, though perhaps eternally unprovable,"" ""we may never know,"" ""it's at least possible,"" ""will we ever know?,"" ""let me just blurt out what I think happened,"" etc. -- infest Baker's narrative, usually preceded or followed by wild accusations (and, occasionally, by a sign of self-awareness: ""I lay in bed some of today reading more of this book, hating it, excited by it, embarrassed by it""). At times, the book is framed as a deliberate challenge to the intelligence community: ""I could be completely wrong. The only way to prove me wrong is by declassifying the entire document."" But this is not how a historian proceeds. Again and again, Baker bristles with anger over actions that were ""seriously contemplated"" by the C.I.A., other intelligence agencies and the military -- but never undertaken. ""I felt trembly and disgusted at the same time,"" he writes of Operation Sphinx, a proposal to gas millions of Japanese from the air during World War II. ""It's a horrible and disillusioning thing to know that your own country was passing around a paper like Sphinx in the Pentagon."" Really? To know that in a brutal war men thought brutal things? At another point, he questions the ""long, interesting, confusing letter"" he got from Floyd O'Neal, one of some 30 captured American airmen and Marines who ""confessed"" to germ-warfare bombing in Korea. O'Neal's confession is ""surprising and moving, though, whether or not it's true,"" Baker tells us. O'Neal ""recanted completely"" after he was released, and writes in his letter of sustaining torture so awful he still won't describe it to Baker more than 50 years later: ""What they did for the next days I don't care to discuss but I finally agreed to sign their confession."" There is nothing surprising or moving about a coerced confession, save for O'Neal's ability to endure the price it exacted. Baker concedes that ""Americans individually have done good things,"" a gesture followed by a banal list that includes ""sunglasses,"" ""topiary,"" ""no-hitters"" and ""the midcentury New Yorker."" Yes, and also little baby ducks and old pickup trucks. This is another affectation of virtue, not a moral argument. I share Baker's disgust with all the crazy, wasteful, illegal, counterproductive and murderous things the C.I.A. has done, and no doubt continues to do. Hell, I even like dogs. Baker's Olympian worldview, though, takes him to almost the same place he landed in ""Human Smoke,"" his paste-up 2008 history of the road to World War II: immobilized by purity and concluding that we should never have intervened, even to stop the Nazis. Americans are neither beasts nor angels, just human beings trying to forge our way through the murky moral choices this world poses. To pretend otherwise is perhaps the worst deception of all.","""Baseless,"" the novelist's new work of nonfiction, is the record of a frustrated investigation and an indictment of government secrecy.",9a7ae54e-96db-5ad2-bc2d-63a4d1ca900a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/08/books/review/Baker1/Baker1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7a05d92754249554836d920ce4ab05906469753f949c550dafacba995b316e51&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nicholson Baker dredges up many of the ""nasty, ugly, wrong things"" done by intelligence agencies and the military in our name, especially during the Cold War era.",9a7ae54e-96db-5ad2-bc2d-63a4d1ca900a,N24News/imgs/9a7ae54e-96db-5ad2-bc2d-63a4d1ca900a.jpg,13
Books,A Sudanese Slave Starts a New Life in an Italian Convent,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/04/books/review/bakhita-veronique-olmi-roman-catholic-saint.html,"BAKHITA

 A Novel of the Saint of Sudan

 By Veronique Olmi

 Translated by Adriana Hunter

Veronique Olmi's novel retells the story of a strong young woman who was exploited and dehumanized before finding herself in more merciful and hopeful circumstances. In ""Bakhita,"" fraught personal experiences intersect with historical and political events and time-honored religious practices, all encompassed within the span of the protagonist's own life -- which moves from a village in late-19th-century Sudan to a convent in post-World-War-II Italy, and from slavery to sainthood.

Translated from the French by Adriana Hunter into clear and affecting prose, ""Bakhita"" unfolds a distinctive array of timely concerns -- the subjugation of women of color, human trafficking, female solidarity, personal and institutional conflicts that knot together issues of race, class, gender and religion -- and explores them through the suffering, willpower and undiminished dignity of a small frightened girl turned resolute young woman turned gentle old nun. The novel also joins a much larger tradition of accounts of holy women and men that have been compiled over the centuries, including the ""Storia Meravigliosa"" (""marvelous or wonderful story""), a 1931 chronicle of Sister Josephine Bakhita's life that was disseminated by the Italian religious order she had joined.

To be sure, there is nothing wonderful in the first half of the novel, never mind the evidence for the meaning of Bakhita's name, ""lucky one"" in Arabic, which she is caustically assigned by one of the slave traders who sell and resell her and subject her to unspeakable barbarity. She never replaces it because she can't remember her real name or that of her village and family, all destroyed when she was first captured at about the age of 7, in the mid-1870s.

Olmi traces out the child's successive captivities and introduces us to the fellow slaves she befriends and loses while being marched in chains from Darfur to Khartoum. In excruciating detail, Olmi describes what's done to Bakhita and what she sees done to others -- women, children and babies -- along a vulture-shadowed slave route and as an urban house slave. This could come across as gratuitously lurid, not least because the narrative is focused on and through Bakhita, whose psychological scarring is outpaced only by her physical scarring. On occasion, however, Olmi shifts into a cooler, more documentarian perspective that emphasizes the factual basis of both the individual story and its larger historical events. This prevents us from becoming either desensitized or cheaply fascinated by the otherwise relentless chronicling of Bakhita's misery-filled Sudan days.","Véronique Olmi's novel ""Bakhita"" reimagines the real-life story of St. Josephine Bakhita, captured as a child in Darfur and liberated in Venice.",dc3a99a0-5d35-5864-8acb-bb30f77af602,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/books/review/00Boyagoda1/00Boyagoda1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=84e53f5302e30775430a2a4b7147f2fa66bba47bf3f1504e7afe91ef537fb037&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"<p>Véronique Olmi's novel ""Bakhita"" reimagines the life of a Sudanese saint.</p>",dc3a99a0-5d35-5864-8acb-bb30f77af602,N24News/imgs/dc3a99a0-5d35-5864-8acb-bb30f77af602.jpg,13
Movies,"Clint Eastwood Sues, Says He Has Nothing to Do With CBD Products",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/22/movies/clint-eastwood-cbd-defamation-lawsuit.html,"The Academy Award-winning actor, producer and director, 90, filed two lawsuits Wednesday in federal court in Los Angeles against three CBD manufacturers and marketers that had posted online articles falsely claiming that he endorsed CBD products and 10 online retailers who he alleged had manipulated search results to make it look like he had done so. He is seeking millions of dollars in damages and a court order that the companies be forced to give up their profits.

""Mr. Eastwood has no connection of any kind whatsoever to any CBD products and never gave such an interview,"" the court documents say.

The first lawsuit, claiming defamation, targets three CBD companies -- Sera Labs Inc., Greendios and For Our Vets LLC -- that produced fake news stories claiming that Eastwood endorsed their products and that he was leaving filmmaking to focus on the CBD business. The second suit argues that 10 companies and individuals are using programming code to insert Eastwood's name into online search results for CBD products, misleading consumers into thinking the filmmaker is manufacturing or endorsing them.

Your Money,How to Make the Family Business Work Across the Generations,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/your-money/family-business-multiple-generations.html,"Yuta Suzuki was studying finance with the goal of becoming an investment banker. Then his father called. ""He came to me with a serious face and said, 'I heard you're good at math,'"" Mr. Suzuki, 37, said. ""We have a small problem. We need your help."" His father, Toshio Suzuki, was the chef and co-owner of the restaurant Sushi Zen, which had been a Midtown Manhattan institution for more than 30 years. And his problem wasn't so small. ""When I looked at the books it wasn't healthy,"" his son said. But the son wanted to help. ""I thought it was a great opportunity to try out what I could do,"" he said. ""I stared at everything from auditing, to regular food purchases, to how consistently everyone was cutting the fish.""

And in the process, he found himself working in a sushi restaurant. Five years later, Sushi Zen is closed, but father and son are continuing the family business in a new venture called Suzuki. There, the tables are turned, with the son running the business so his father can just make sushi. ""When I was operating Sushi Zen, it was my duty solely to keep the business afloat and keep the guests happy,"" the elder Mr. Suzuki, 71, said through a translator. ""In the new place, financing and management are covered by my son. I wanted to focus on training and bringing up my younger staff."" Conversations about family business succession are as complicated as families themselves, but since the businesses are usually the primary driver of wealth in the family, it is essential to have such discussions, uncomfortable or not. That doesn't mean they go smoothly, or even happen when they should. ""The business and the family are usually so intertwined,"" said Karen Reynolds Sharkey, national business owner strategist at U.S. Trust, the banking company. ""The business is really another member of the family as they grow up."" The Suzuki family transition has been smooth so far. (A younger brother has not expressed interest in the business.) But advisers say that when transitions go smoothly, there has been a lot of planning, a bit of luck or both.

Jose Der emigrated from Cuba nearly 60 years ago and set up Der Dau, his custom boot-making business, in New York. It counts celebrities and fashion-conscious urbanites as clients. His son Joseph, 44, said he had been groomed since age 8 to take over the business. ""I grew up becoming a cobbler and learned all the trades from him,"" he said. His two sisters, by contrast, were not interested in the boot-making business, which made the succession decision easier. Still, taking something that his father created and making it his own wasn't easy at first. ""He's very old school, very traditional,"" Joseph Der said of his father. ""I like fashion. I brought out a lot of funny colors, and it took off."" Mr. Der said that early on, when he wanted to make the family's boots less traditional and more fashionable to attract clients like Madonna, he clashed with his father.

When his father, who is in his 90s, let him do that, he said he learned a valuable lesson: ""If two people work together and they can kind of compromise with each other, they can work as a great team."" For a family business to be passed on to a son or daughter, the critical factor is the desire of the child to be involved. ""At the end of the day, it starts with what the second generation wants,"" Mr. Genberg said. ""You're going to make something work that doesn't work?"" Liza Towell Boyd, a top equestrian, had success riding other people's horses since age 10. Her father, Jack Towell, said the family joked that her nickname was ""cash machine."" ""People would send me horses, and she'd ride them and make them famous and I'd sell them,"" said Mr. Towell, who owns Finally Farm in Camden, S.C. ""She couldn't get paid, but I could."" While Ms. Boyd, now in her late 30s, continues to compete on the national hunter jumper circuit, she has taken on more responsibilities with the family business, from training horses to teaching children and up-and-coming riders. ""He's my biggest cheerleader in competitions, but also on the business side, too,"" she said. ""You need someone there to teach you the ropes and to be honest and to work really hard and be dedicated.""

""When I married my husband I said, 'You're marrying my father too,'"" Ms. Boyd recalled. ""He's the first person to call in the morning and the last person I talk to at night."" Dennis Shah started working in his father's high-end wallpaper business, Chambord Prints, in Hoboken, N.J., straight out of business school in the 1980s. He had a good 20-year run before he realized he needed to take it in a different direction. ""We were a factory, and business started to die out,"" said Mr. Shah, 52. ""Wallpaper was going out of style by 2005. I still had faith in the product."" So he contracted with several artists to create custom wallpaper, to reinvigorate the company's product line. ""One of the big things is my father's way of being able to trust me and being able to delegate and to think strategically,"" Mr. Shah said. His father, now 86, said he appreciated his son's ability to inject a modern perspective. ""Working together, we get ideas from each other,"" said H. K. Shah. ""I'm a 16th- century person. He's a 21st-century person. It helps us get better and better."" In some instances, the child needs to push back. Yuta Suzuki said his father's vision for their new restaurant was to have a 10-seat sushi bar where he used only the best 30 percent of a fish and served it to be eaten immediately. His son pointed out that this was probably not the best way to turn a profit.

So they compromised. The elder Mr. Suzuki controls the sushi bar, but there are two other restaurants within the space -- traditional kaiseki dining and a sit-down sushi space -- to offer different dining experiences and bigger margins. Daisy Medici, a managing director at GenSpring, a wealth management firm, says she encourages families that run businesses to develop voluntary governance policies. ""They need to put policies in place with how they're going to work together,"" she said. ""We have risk management policies, a code of conduct, trust distribution policies, vacation home policies."" The likelihood of friction is high, but so is the opportunity to grow closer. The younger Mr. Suzuki, for instance, said that going into the restaurant business helped him understand what his father had been doing all those years. ""I never experienced that father-son relationship because he worked six days a week, and then on Sunday he slept because he was so exhausted,"" he said. ""I got to experience the day with him and the chefs."" Now that he is overseeing Suzuki restaurant, he said, he feels the pride of running something that helps his whole family. Where he struggles is calling himself his father's boss. ""I never pictured that I'd be hiring my father,"" he said. ""I try not to think of that.""","Lessons from families in the sushi, boot-making and wallpaper businesses.",3e9c8918-786a-53c9-aa9f-03ed72ef7e80,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/23/business/24WEALTH3/24WEALTH3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=550f87d73fcc1e09328dda6f6a6f7e79c7d216ae0bfa49d7d89b77aa69b4c40a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Toshio Suzuki, left, and his son Yuta at their restaurant.

Science,Lab-Grown Meat That Doesn't Look Like Mush,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/science/lab-meat-texture.html,"The alt-meat industry has created quite a sizzle, promising delicious burgers, steaks and even sushi that is grown from animal cells in the lab. But most cellular agriculture still looks like mush. The manufacturing process -- which starts with animal muscle and fat grown from stem cells in petri dishes -- is fine for making burgers, but it fails to provide the kind of texture needed for more substantial cuts of meat, like steaks. On Monday, scientists at Harvard University reported that they had found a way to more closely mimic the form and flavor of real meat, by growing the muscle cells of cows and rabbits on a gelatin scaffold. Their research was published in the journal Science of Food. ""We showed that it can be done,"" said Luke MacQueen, the Harvard researcher who led the study. ""Now we'll keep improving our methods, tweaking the type of scaffold fiber to try even more complex textures, tastes and nutritional profiles.""

Refining this technique and others like it could help more people, including serious carnivores, consider lab-grown meat as a sustainable, ethical alternative to meat raised for slaughter, Dr. MacQueen said. In the body, groups of cells get physical support from an extracellular matrix, which is made up of water, collagen proteins and various nutrients. The extracellular matrix also provides essential cues for growth, cell orientation and differentiation. ""Muscle cells need a structure to grow on, the same way the walls of a building need a steel frame or a house needs a wooden skeleton,"" said Kevin Kit Parker, a bioengineer at Harvard and also a co-author of the study. To mimic this cellular environment, Dr. Parker and his colleagues decided to make scaffolds out of different concentrations of gelatin, a protein product derived from collagen. When collagen-rich meat cuts, such as beef chuck, are cooked, the heat naturally melts collagen fibers into softer gelatin, giving meat its succulent texture, Dr. Parker said. To make gelatin microfibers, the researchers dissolved commercially available gelatin powder in water and spun it like cotton candy. Rotating the gelatinous slurry at high speeds allowed fibers to form at the bottom of the spinner. Using enzymes, the researchers then cross-linked the fibers to form a strong, woven structure for cells to grow on.

Rabbit and cow cells latched onto the gelatin scaffold, growing until they formed about a square inch of muscle. To test whether the final product resembled the texture and behavior of meat that chefs and home cooks use every day, the researchers performed a variety of food industry analyses: simulating cooking by heating the lab-grown meat on a hot plate, compressing it as if with a meat mallet and measuring the force needed to cut each piece of meat. They found that their lab-grown meat fell in between the springiness of a hamburger and a beef tenderloin.

The Harvard scientists are not the only ones testing scaffolds for cell-based meat. Some researchers have been inspired by the field of regenerative medicine, where scaffolds are used to help grow tissue that may one day be used for repairing organs or replacing grafts. They have transformed spinach leaves into scaffolds by removing all the plant's cells and using the empty cell walls as a frame for growing animal tissue. Other groups have modified apples, artichokes and the threadlike roots of mushrooms. Cellular agriculture companies are also devising scaffolds from naturally occurring materials, such as cellulose, starch and alginate, which may be more affordable than engineering scaffolds from scratch. ""Different cells have different needs,"" said Justin Kolbeck, co-founder and C.E.O. of Wild Type, a start-up making cultured salmon. ""Fish flakes differently because its underlying architecture is quite different from other types of meat. Our cells also grow at different temperatures from mammalian systems, so the scaffolds we develop need to be really optimized for fish cells in all of these regards."" Before cultured meat or fish becomes a dinnertime staple, companies also must overcome challenges of scale, said Gregory Ziegler, a food science professor at Pennsylvania State University. They need to optimize the media that cells grow in and arrange large bioreactor facilities to culture enormous volumes of cells at a pace that matches customer demand. It took Wild Type three and a half weeks to create a pound of salmon for a tasting event at Portland, Oregon's Olympia Oyster Bar in June.","In their quest to make a lab-grown steak, researchers devised a form of scaffolding made with gelatin.",ce2374db-9692-5017-9c34-05db23ded0bb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/29/science/25CULTUREDMEAT1/merlin_163255269_06e96f60-58e9-473f-a8a6-c046012bb9d0-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bde7b01c57c9581af8c8ee371b3aed1d9c358bf1bc9bac731b89636be7b40840&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sheets of gelatin fibers form a base for muscle cells to grow on, and add texture to cultured meat.",ce2374db-9692-5017-9c34-05db23ded0bb,N24News/imgs/ce2374db-9692-5017-9c34-05db23ded0bb.jpg,2
Your Money,How Big Do You Want Your Nest Egg to Be?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/your-money/how-big-do-you-want-your-nest-egg-to-be.html,"How Big Do You Want Your Nest Egg to Be?

Twenty million dollars. That's how much Julien Mellon needs to live the life he wants. With that kind of cash, Mr. Mellon, a 32-year-old tour guide, could buy a ""beautiful"" home with enough left over to spend $100,000 a year (""in 2017 dollars"") until the day he dies. That same number would also work for Celeste Hilling, the founder, chief and product formulator at Skin Authority. Twenty million would allow her to put her 17-year-old daughter through college, ""give to philanthropy -- especially women's and children's causes -- start another company, and travel as part of work combined with personal pursuits,"" said Ms. Hilling, 58. And then there is Susan Sosnow, a real estate investor and landlord. All Ms. Sosnow, 49, needs to feel secure is $36,000 a year. Really. She nets a fraction of that as a landlord. Explaining the relatively low figure, she said: ""I'm not interested in traveling; I'm interested in creating paradise at home, Candyland. I'm still driving the '99 Ford Escort wagon I bought for $3,200 cash in 2004. But sometimes it sits in my driveway for a week and I just ride my bike around.""

Money may not buy happiness, but it can certainly buy freedom and security, which contribute mightily to happiness. It also helps alleviate sadness, as a 2015 paper found. In the study, researchers examined data from over 12,000 Americans. Wealthier individuals did not experience greater feelings of happiness on a day-to-day basis, but they did experience reduced feelings of sadness. ""We argue that this reduction in sadness occurs because money provides a sense of perceived control,"" said Elizabeth W. Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and a co-author of the paper. She also co-authored the book ""Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending.""

Jill Falcon, 46, a single stay-at-home mother of a 4-year-old, agrees. While she does not believe there is a number to buy happiness, ""Money buys safety, convenience, luxury,"" she said. ""It can reduce worries and stress. I would love the freedom money would bring."" At a time when the ranks of the ultrawealthy -- millionaires and even billionaires -- are on the rise, the magic number for many people is surprisingly modest. Celeste Hilling would like $20 million. The founder, chief and product formulator at Skin Authority, Ms. Hilling would put her 17-year-old daughter through college, support causes for women and children, start another company and travel. Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times So how much is ""enough""? Clearly, the definition of enough depends on where you live and your responsibilities. Ms. Sosnow is single and lives in Gainesville, Fla., which is significantly less expensive than San Diego, where Ms. Hilling lives with her husband and daughter, or Brooklyn, where Mr. Mellon resides. For Ms. Falcon, ""enough"" is somewhere between $8 million and $10 million, so she could give her daughter ""the best of everything,"" as she put it: ""Private school, college, money for an advanced degree at an Ivy League university, two homes, unlimited vacations. Retirement. Cars, gas, food, shelter, extras. I'd also like to make sure my mom is set for life not having to worry about money."" But it's not pure hedonism. Ms. Falcon also wants to contribute to charity. So does Andrea Todd. Her number hovers around $65 million. With that she would travel with her family. But ""I see that as an educational experience more than a luxury item purchased with a windfall,"" said Ms. Todd, 51, a writer and teacher in Sacramento who is married with three children. ""We'd travel cheap and dirty, with immersion in mind."" But she would also buy a farm for animals, as Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey, did. While Ms. Todd would continue teaching at Cristo Rey, a Catholic high school in Sacramento, she would not take a salary. She would also give money to all her alma maters that would be used for tuition. ""I worked my way through Catholic school and college,"" she said. ""It would make me very happy to ensure other students were relieved of that stress.""

""We have a half mil in the bank, and I panic all the time about not having enough,"" Ms. Todd said. In addition to her parents and in-laws, all of whom are in their 90s ""with two pension plans possibly running out,"" her two children will be heading to college in the next five years. She also has a $500,000 home with $400,000 still owed on it and a retirement fund that did not begin until 2002, when her husband graduated from law school.

Others would like enough money to allow them to pursue other interests. Valerie Smaldone, a media personality and brand strategist in New York, who declined to give her age, said she could make it work with a monthly stipend of $10,000 for the rest of her life. She'd like a minimum of $250,000 in retirement income on top of that, which would continue to appreciate yearly. She doesn't plan to ever stop working, but if she had ""stupid money"" to live off, she said, she would ""produce a film or a play, or provide funding to animals who are abused. Learn something I always wanted to learn. Take a serious wine course, or do something in the food industry."" Melissa Soalt, the founder of global self-defense programs for women, would be set with a cool $5 million. ""Being self-employed often means having to 'sing for my supper,'"" said Ms. Soalt, 61, of Amherst, Mass. ""This would take some of the pressure off. It would not only make my life more secure -- I would purchase a modest home -- but allow me to do more to help the world."" ""Without the actual money, things remain realistically out of reach,"" she added. Kendall Rush, 47 and a grandfather, knows exactly how he would allocate his fantasy $6 million: He would take $2 million to pay off debts for himself and his immediate family, secure housing and transportation, and set up a communal trust fund with the rest for emergencies and medical. ""The third million would go toward relocation of myself and my household,"" Mr. Rush, a help-desk administrator for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in Buffalo, wrote in an email. ""Half a million for educational trust fund for kids and family. Half a million in personal accounts for day-to-day expenses. One million for investments stocks/bonds. One million to invest in small, local businesses.""

As he got older and made money, he felt the need to show off all the trappings of his rich life. ""I remember buying a Porsche and then a Bentley because it looked better,"" he said. He has also owned a Ferrari. He got rid of them (now he collects motorcycles -- he has nine), but he is fond of his lifestyle. So if for some reason he could no longer work, he would like $10 million. ""Ten million dollars wouldn't affect my lifestyle and allow me to continue it,"" which includes zipping around the world at a moment's notice, he said. Lynne Dewhurst McBurney, 50, who manages litigation for a financial services company and lives with her husband and son in Ridgewood, N.J., would not quit her job if she got her $6 million. But she might retire earlier. ""Maybe it's a secret homage to Lee Majors,"" she said, referring to the actor who played the lead in ""The Six Million Dollar Man,"" a 1970s television show. ""But it's more like, own my home plus a pied-a-terre in Paris, and a cottage in Maine, and live off interest income from the $4 million we'd have left,"" she said. Mr. Mellon has a more visceral reason for how he arrived at his $20 million number. ""The real story for me personally is how bad it hurts that I don't believe I will ever be able to own a home in the place where I grew up,"" said Mr. Mellon, who was raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The actress Michelle Williams ""bought the house I grew up dreaming of"" in the Victorian Flatbush Historic District, said Mr. Mellon. If housing weren't an issue, he would need very little: just enough to invest so he would never need to work again. ""If I assume that I can own it outright, I imagine having enough to replace the boiler and fix the roof and keep up with my membership at MoMA,"" he said. As for Ms. Sosnow, her life is simple and straightforward. ""If I wanted more money, I could pursue it, but why?"" she said.","A sampling indicates people's calculations typically range into seven (or even eight) figures. But one woman says $36,000 a year would be just fine.",2623989b-a38e-5680-8b55-268a0a2fecc5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/26/business/26NUMBER2/26NUMBER2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f4629ec1ac97fb9e5a4ac8843e052c01dd97a7987126ce83377e8631fe3a6417&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julien Mellon is a tour guide who was raised in Flatbush, Brooklyn.

Music,Lady Antebellum Sues the Singer Lady A Over Name Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/arts/music/lady-antebellum-lady-a-lawsuit.html,"When the country trio Lady Antebellum announced last month that it would change its Civil War-referencing band name to Lady A out of respect for Black people, the group credited the widespread protests against police brutality for revealing ""blind spots we didn't even know existed.""

Barely a day later, another blind spot made itself known: Anita White, a blues singer and Black woman, had been using the stage name Lady A for over 20 years. ""This is my life,"" she said.

In the weeks that followed, an apparent detente between the two parties, initially celebrated on social media by both sides, faltered when representatives for White ""demanded a $10 million payment,"" the band said in a statement on Wednesday. Now, the platinum-selling Nashville group has filed a lawsuit that seeks no monetary damages, but asks the court to affirm ""a trademark we have held for many years.""

The trio, whose suit says it began using the nickname Lady A not long after it formed in 2006, said that it was not aiming to have White change her moniker, but seeking to protect itself from further litigation. The group first applied to register ""Lady A"" for use in music, videos, live performances and merchandise in 2010, the suit says, adding ""no oppositions were filed by any person or entity, including White.""","The platinum-selling country group's new name was already being used by a blues singer.

Movies,'Annabelle Comes Home' Review: An Evil Doll Returns and She's Not Alone,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/movies/annabelle-comes-home-review.html,"After warning us that the possessed doll is ""a beacon for other spirits,"" the demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren (Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga) lock her in a special artifacts room in their home alongside other malevolent bits and bobs. A priest's blessing and signage along the lines of ""Super-duper evil -- keep out!"" complete the security arrangements as the Warrens promptly clear off, leaving their young daughter, her babysitter and a bereaved friend to their own devices. Anyone in any doubt as to what happens next clearly needs to get out more.

Groaning predictability, though, is only one problem in a movie choking on haunted-house cliches and so short of genuine scares that its most traumatizing sight might be the Warrens' hideous wallpaper. Shadows flit past mirrors and doors vibrate to the battering of invisible fists, weak teasers with disappointing payoffs. Excepting Katie Sarife, whose subtly shaded performance as the wildly incautious friend augurs a fine career in tough-yet-tender roles, ""Annabelle Comes Home"" feels stretched and tired.

Music,Hospitals Play 'Songs of Hope' as Virus Patients Go Home,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/arts/music/coronavirus-hospital-songs.html,"In the 11 days he spent fighting Covid-19 at Montefiore Nyack Hospital, there was one thing Mark Schwarz couldn't figure out. ""Occasionally throughout the days there, you would randomly start hearing music playing and wonder, 'What's that for?'"" Mr. Schwarz, 54, said on Tuesday. On Monday, when it finally came time for Mr. Schwarz to go home from the hospital in Nyack, N.Y., he heard for himself: The cheerful chorus of the Beatles' ""Here Comes the Sun"" rang through the hospital hallways to celebrate his discharge. Pick a hospital in the metropolitan area of New York these days, and you are likely to find that the staff has identified a song as the fitting soundtrack to the release of patients who had been hospitalized because of the virus.

Many have chosen ""Here Comes the Sun,"" long associated with finding joy through hard times. When it and other songs are played, it is not only a tribute to the resilience of the patient, but also an anthem of affirmation for the medical professionals: Through long shifts, with few positive moments and supplies stretched thin, they have saved another life.

""I think it was more of a recognition of them than me,"" Mr. Schwarz agreed. At some hospitals, the music starts playing long before discharge. At Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, for example, nurses call for a ""Code Sun"" when a patient is removed from a ventilator and successfully breathing on their own; Montefiore Nyack plays it when patients move out of intensive care. ""Honestly,"" said Devjit Roy, Mr. Schwarz's doctor at Montefiore Nyack, ""I guess it's just the sound of hope."" Several hospitals have chosen tracks with similar gentle optimism -- ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" at NYC Health + Hospitals/Coney Island, Bill Withers's ""Lean on Me"" at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. Others go straight for inspirational rock: Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin'"" is a popular pick, as is Survivor's ""Eye of the Tiger.""

Some hospitals opt for a more literal soundtrack. When a patient comes off a ventilator at Mount Sinai South Nassau in Oceanside, N.Y., hospital staff put on Anna Nalick's ""Breathe (2 AM)."" Elsewhere on Long Island, at Mather Hospital in Port Jefferson, it's the Police's ""Every Breath You Take."" Using music to celebrate patient milestones is not brand new, of course. At NYC Health + Hospitals/Metropolitan in East Harlem, the ICU director, Natoushka Trenard, said they traditionally play music when a baby is born. Right now, she said, extubating a patient feels similarly miraculous. ""Don't Stop Believin',"" she said, ""sort of goes with the theme that in addition to all the science we're trying to apply to these patients, all the medicine, all the research we're trying to do in real time while this is happening -- faith plays a part in this.""



""Whenever the right song comes on, like 'Eye of the Tiger,' we all just start singing to keep the morale up,"" Dr. Roy said. The music is only one of several ways that medical professionals are trying to keep spirits high, both for patients and each other. At Montefiore Nyack, the physician who discharges the most coronavirus patients each day is crowned the ""Covid Crusher."" Nurses give the winner orange juice and a tiara.

During Karla Duarte's three weeks at Cohen Children's Medical Center in Queens, nurses brought in photos of her dog, Canelo, and had a spa day where they did her hair and painted her nails red. But music was also a big part of boosting her morale. Karla, 16, heard ""Here Comes the Sun"" when she was taken off the ECMO life support machine. When she was discharged Sunday, the staff sent her home with ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough."" ""We've lost some patients, and we've had some victories,"" said her doctor, James Schneider. But the song served as a reminder, he added, that ""there is hope and value to what we do, and despite the challenges we've been facing together as a group over the last month, there is no mountain high enough. We're going to overcome.""","Anthems like ""Don't Stop Believin',"" the ""Rocky"" theme and ""Every Breath You Take"" have been adopted by hospitals to celebrate each victory in the battle against coronavirus.",9f9622e3-0732-5bf0-b50d-21c4f02ebccb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/23/arts/23virus-anthems-1/23virus-anthems-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7fc77fe20a83d3981b3c0a815912b3cfe57faa5ddac5ab7f9a5f67753016f8eb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Karla Duarte, holding a colorful poster signed by the nursing staff, was discharged on Sunday to the tune of ""Ain't No Mountain High Enough.""",9f9622e3-0732-5bf0-b50d-21c4f02ebccb,N24News/imgs/9f9622e3-0732-5bf0-b50d-21c4f02ebccb.jpg,12
Television,Jussie Smollett Pleads Not Guilty in Repeat Appearance in Court,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/24/arts/television/jussie-smollett-hate-crime.html,"CHICAGO -- Almost a year after he walked out of court seemingly a free man, the actor Jussie Smollett returned to court on Monday to again face charges that he had lied to the police about a hate crime attack that detectives said he had staged. Mr. Smollett, 37, appeared in court two weeks after a special prosecutor, Dan K. Webb, announced that a grand jury had indicted Mr. Smollett on nearly identical charges that the Cook County State's Attorney's Office dropped 11 months ago. Mr. Smollett's lawyer, Tina Glandian, entered a plea of not guilty as her client stood before the judge, hands clasped and with his black overcoat still on. The judge, James B. Linn of Cook County Circuit Court, allowed the actor to remain free, saying he was not a flight risk and rejecting prosecutors' request for $10,000 bail. Mr. Smollett walked out without comment, his departure captured by a line of television cameras in the hallways outside the courtroom. [A timeline of the case|What we know about the evidence] The case has spellbound the city ever since Mr. Smollett, who played a son of a hip-hop mogul on the Fox drama ""Empire,"" reported on Jan. 29, 2019, that he had been attacked by two men who shouted racist and homophobic slurs, placed a noose around his neck and poured bleach on him. Mr. Smollett, who is gay, told the police that the attackers also yelled, ""This is MAGA country,"" a reference to President Trump's 2016 campaign slogan.

But the Police Department concluded that Mr. Smollett had paid two brothers to stage the attack because he was unhappy with his salary on ""Empire."" Weeks after Mr. Smollett was indicted, the state's attorney's office dropped the charges against him. In exchange, Mr. Smollett performed 15 hours of community service and forfeited the $10,000 bond that had released him from jail. Prosecutors said at the time that it was an appropriate resolution because Mr. Smollett was not a violent criminal and had a long record of community service. But the outcome angered prominent officials in Chicago, including then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel; the city is now suing Mr. Smollett for more than $130,000 it said it had spent investigating the reported hate crime. Mr. Smollett has maintained his innocence throughout, denying that he had hired the brothers. A judge appointed Mr. Webb, a former federal prosecutor, as special prosecutor last year after concluding that the State's Attorney, Kim Foxx, had acted improperly when she handed the case to her deputy instead of someone outside her office. Ms. Foxx had removed herself from the case because of contact she had with representatives of Mr. Smollett when the police still considered him a victim.

When the office approved the first grand jury indictment, it appeared to have strong evidence against Mr. Smollett, Mr. Webb said. There was no indication that prosecutors had learned new information casting doubt on Mr. Smollett's guilt before the office dropped all of the charges against him without requiring that he admit wrongdoing, Mr. Webb said. Ms. Glandian, the actor's lawyer, said on Monday that she had filed a motion with the Illinois Supreme Court arguing that the new indictment constituted double jeopardy because Mr. Smollett had already been punished by forfeiting the $10,000 bond. ""Trying to punish him a second time around is not permitted,"" she said outside court, adding that it was ""very frustrating"" for Mr. Smollett to be back in court nearly a year after the charges were dropped. Mr. Webb did not comment on the motion, but is likely to argue that because Mr. Smollett never was tried or pleaded guilty, he was still eligible to be prosecuted. Ms. Foxx is running for re-election, and her opponents in the Democratic primary have criticized her office's handling of the Smollett case. Her campaign denounced the ""James Comey-like timing"" of the new charges, referring to the former F.B.I. director's public pronouncements about the investigation into Hillary Clinton's email server just before she lost to Mr. Trump. Mr. Webb said that he had not found any wrongdoing by Ms. Foxx's office, but that he was still investigating. Mr. Smollett was dropped from the cast of ""Empire"" after his arrest last year. Since then, his acting and singing career appears to have stalled, and he has had little public exposure beyond his court appearances.","Nearly a year after prosecutors in Chicago dropped charges accusing the actor of staging a hate crime attack on himself, the case has been revived.",14df94b6-9918-56eb-93de-4de9ac6b8f1e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/24/arts/24smollett/24smollett-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=984fe92081f1f83515d72794f9fb86f6fa12db78d0261b39693b62e47b66dcc5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jussie Smollett arrives at court on Monday.,14df94b6-9918-56eb-93de-4de9ac6b8f1e,N24News/imgs/14df94b6-9918-56eb-93de-4de9ac6b8f1e.jpg,3

Sports,"'Gate Was Zero,' but Dana White Says U.F.C. 249 Was a Success",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/sports/UFC-249-dana-white-joe-rogan.html,"At a news conference after a pay-per-view card, Dana White, the Ultimate Fighting Championship president, usually strolls to the dais clutching a sheet of paper and reads out the event's attendance and ticket revenue.

But U.F.C. 249 in Jacksonville, Fla., on Saturday night wasn't a usual fight card. It landed there after the coronavirus pandemic forced a postponement and a venue change. Along the way, the U.F.C. had to replace one of the fighters in the main event. And the fight card, the first major North American pro sports competition since mid-March, unfolded without spectators, who were barred from the arena under guidelines meant to prevent the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus.

Still, after Justin Gaethje beat Tony Ferguson to win the interim lightweight belt, White appeared at the postfight news conference as he always does, stat sheet in hand.

""Gate was zero. Attendance was zero,"" he said. ""That's a first.""

But despite the hit to ticket revenue, White left Saturday's event optimistic about the near-term future.The U.F.C. has two more events scheduled for Jacksonville this week, on Wednesday and Saturday, and White is seeking clearance from the Nevada Athletic Commission to host fights on May 23 at the U.F.C.'s Apex Center in Las Vegas. He held up Saturday's event as proof that under the right guidelines, pro sports events could proceed safely.",The organization's president voiced optimism even after a bout on Saturday was canceled because a fighter tested positive for the virus.,32eec63f-15fd-5017-8805-588fbb62c928,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/11/sports/10ufc-folo1-print/10ufc-folo-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=0a454773bda2852386e34b1eb0e45966a23651ace2e77f2fcb29e48956b0c222&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Members of the media watched one of the bouts at U.F.C. 249 on Saturday night in Jacksonville, Fla.",32eec63f-15fd-5017-8805-588fbb62c928,N24News/imgs/32eec63f-15fd-5017-8805-588fbb62c928.jpg,9
Your Money,Red-Flag Time: Your Broker Offers a Can't-Miss Sales Contest,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/22/your-money/red-flag-time-your-broker-offers-a-cant-miss-sales-contest.html,"The poor and middle class may not be the only ones to fall victim to financial firms. Even the wealthy, who are supposed to be sophisticated about money matters, can be targets. According to the Massachusetts securities regulator, Morgan Stanley ran a sales contest to give incentives to its brokers to sell securities-backed loans to its wealth management clients in Massachusetts and Rhode Island. The sales contest tripled the number of these loans in those states in 2014 and 2015, the regulator said in a complaint this month. Whether the bank's clients actually needed such potentially high-risk and costly products is not clear. The complaint against Morgan Stanley came just weeks after Wells Fargo was fined $185 million for opening thousands of sham accounts for its mostly middle-class customers.

Morgan Stanley has denied the charges. But the accusations against both banks, experts say, give new meaning to the phrase ""buyer beware."" When brokers try to sell products like securities-backed loans -- which are similar to margin loans but with lower interest rates and different requirements on when they can be called -- the only thing that is certain is that the broker will make more money. First of all, no one disputes that sales contests are a way of life at large brokerage houses, even if they are not sanctioned at the top. Kevin Neal, a former broker at UBS Wealth Management who founded Moenio, a client advocacy firm focused on helping clients find the best advisers, said that sales contests were common when he was a broker and that they remain a part of the culture at all the big companies. ""At the end of the day, they're sales organizations,"" he said. ""They're not an entity that was created for benevolency. They're institutions that are created to make money.""

He said, though, that the companies needed guidelines on how the contests could be conducted. The reward for pushing the loans at Morgan Stanley was rather low. It started at $100 a person and rose to $166 a person, if the broker could sell 30 loans, known as portfolio loan accounts, or P.L.A.s, according to the complaint. Adviser emails showed an enthusiasm for the program that sounded more like outtakes of a Hollywood movie about financial scheming, not what investors might think are the internal emails of one of the largest wealth management companies in the United States. ""One participating Financial Advisor asked, 'Does the bonus stop at 30 PLA's? What if we do 60?? Does that double the bonus to our team??? You know how we are about BDA money!!!'"" B.D.A. stands for business development allowances, which was the bonus that brokers received. Andrew Stoltmann, a lawyer in Chicago who has brought more than 1,000 cases against brokers, suggested that investors adopt a degree of cynicism. ""You have to always question why the broker is calling you with a new product or a different nontraditional investment,"" Mr. Stoltmann said. ""If they do call, be extremely wary."" He suggested that investors ask the brokers to send something in writing with their recommendations, even if it's just an email. That, he said, is one way to have proof of what you were being told. ""These brokers love to sell the sizzle and downplay the risk,"" he said. ""But they get real nervous when they have to put pen to paper.""

Another strategy is to ask the broker why a certain product benefits you, said Gavin Morrissey, managing partner at Financial Strategy Associates, a financial services firm. ""I know some people wouldn't be comfortable answering that,"" Mr. Morrissey said. ""Clients should continuously ask good questions of the adviser. 'I don't understand the portfolio. Why do you have me in this alternative allocation?' Or they say, 'Why did you sell me this thing? I don't know what it does.'"" Even then, there is a risk that a client might not understand the answer. Mr. Morrissey said. That is why it is important that wealthy clients have their advisers, accountants and lawyers speaking to one another. ""If you have someone who is unwilling to inform those other professionals,"" he said, ""the question is, why wouldn't you share something like that?"" He added, ""Wouldn't it be a good idea to know what they're doing?"" In most instances, the brokers pushing products are within their rights. Unlike registered investment advisers, who are required to consider clients' best interests, brokers are held to the lower standard of suitability. And what may be suitable for them to sell may not be suitable -- or certainly prudent -- for their clients to own. , said people who choose to work with firms that have a sales culture need to understand that and make their judgments accordingly. ""If you walk into a car lot, you know you're in a sales process, and your mind shifts to being more aware and more defensive,"" he said. ""When you walk into a firm and you're being led by returns, you still have to be in that mode. You have to be aware that there are people who are selling you things that aren't in your best interest.""

Mr. Gjertsen said that there are products far more common than securities-based loans that clients need to be wary of. He said complicated annuities, which he often sees sold to older clients, can be overly expensive for the guaranteed income they provide. One red flag is a long surrender period -- the time during which a customer would need to pay a penalty to cash in the annuity. The longer that time period -- anything around 10 or 15 years -- the higher the salesman's commission. ""It's within the client's right to ask that professional who sold them an annuity how much commission they're making,"" he said. ""That person is going to say, 'Don't worry about it. The insurance company is paying me.' That's not the point. The point is, am I getting the value for that transaction?"" Frank Moore, chief executive of Vintage Financial Services in Ann Arbor, Mich., and a member of the board of the National Association of Personal Financial Advisors, said one of the more shocking abuses he saw recently was an older client with $2.5 million -- $1.5 million was in annuities, the other $1 million was in nonpublic real estate investment trusts, which are largely illiquid unless they go public. ""We see this stuff all the time,"" he said. ""This one was egregious enough that we may counsel the client to file a claim"" with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Of course, securities-based loans, annuities and illiquid investments are right for certain clients. How to assess them, though, requires extensive research. Mr. Neal of Moenio gave the example of structured notes. These are products created by banks to provide a certain upside and limit the downside for clients. An example would be a note that provided 105 percent of the return of an index tracking the Standard & Poor's 500 and protection against a 10 percent loss.","When brokers try to sell a product like a securities-backed loan, they aren't being charitable.
