* None 

... A Half Hour, And I Want Something Different When to watch: Now, on Hulu Six seasons of this Canadian comedy are currently available to stream, and you might wind up blazing through all of them before Season 7 comes out in October -- it's that fun and surprising. Set in a rural town, ""Letterkenny"" has unique rhythms and stylized dialogue that's sometimes outrageously dirty but more often just hilarious in its specificity (especially lines from Daryl, played by Nathan Dales). Lots of today's best comedies seem alike in attitude or style, but ""Letterkenny"" is flying a solo mission; the jokes are twice as funny because they're so distinctive. ... Six Hours, But That's It When to watch: Starting Friday, on Netflix Sacha Baron Cohen takes on a serious role as the real-life Mossad agent Eli Cohen in this six-part mini-series. Eli Cohen worked under an assumed identity in Syria in the 1960s, eventually infiltrating powerful political and military circles. ""The Spy"" is focused much more on small moments of social adaptability than on big action sequences, but after a slow start it really zips along -- not ignoring the psychological costs of living undercover, but not exactly unpacking them, either. If you like high-tension period dramas, try this. ... Several Hours, and I Want Something Bingeable When to watch: Now, on Netflix This Spanish drama (in Spanish, with subtitles, or dubbed) about an elaborate bank heist is as addictive as early-era ""24,"" following the kind of nonstop cliffhanger-resolution pattern that leads to hours and hours of couch time. While the story got a little thin toward the end of Part 2, Part 3, which debuted this summer, refocuses the action on a new heist that brings some of the band back together, including Tokyo (Ursula Corbero). The exact criminal mechanics can be a little arcane, but there's enough human longing to sustain the momentum even when the caper gets somewhat confusing.",Catch up on a Canadian cult comedy and watch Sacha Baron Cohen get serious for a change.,2cf6e319-4f7c-541a-a627-85335cae117d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/06/arts/06watching-letterkenny/06watching-letterkenny-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=697e1661abb81606bacf977738bbee9f6056de7c8345956e81c4bbaa9444b828&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nathan Dales in ""Letterkenny.""",2cf6e319-4f7c-541a-a627-85335cae117d,N24News/imgs/2cf6e319-4f7c-541a-a627-85335cae117d.jpg,3
Music,"Review: Ahead of 'My Fair Lady,' Two Operatic Pygmalions",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/arts/music/review-my-fair-lady-pygmalion-new-york-city-opera.html,"Is a double bill just a way to fill a couple of hours? Or should it somehow be balanced -- in length, weight, subject matter, mood and aesthetic impact -- to make a unified statement?

On the surface, New York City Opera's coupling of two Pygmalion operas at the Gerald W. Lynch Theater at John Jay College over the weekend seemed to make good -- not to say obvious -- sense, particularly with a Broadway revival of Lerner and Loewe's ""My Fair Lady,"" based on the same story, currently in previews.

But in the event, a greater contrast would have been hard to imagine. Donizetti's spare, somber ""Il Pigmalione"" (1816) is, as program notes pointed out, a student exercise, an extended not-quite-mad scene, and basically a one-man show. Rameau's ""Pigmalion"" (1748) is technically an acte de ballet: a lavish romp and hardly an opera at all.

Both works depart from the mythological tale, in Ovid's ""Metamorphoses,"" of a sculptor who falls in love with a female statue of his own making. In Ovid, Venus brings the ivory figure to sensate life.",New York City Opera presented a double bill of works by Donizetti and Rameau that had less in common than expected.,fd8ae40d-b8ac-5a7b-859b-5402e413ac45,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/27/arts/27CITYOPERA1/27CITYOPERA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c56d1508a3f0981b4fe7185a94a3f3e4d6526341f8ca208fa53c77f4c9c46cfe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Piotr Buszewski in the title role of Donizetti&rsquo;s &ldquo;Il Pigmalione&rdquo; at New York City Opera.

Travel,"In Turkey, Adventure Travel Takes the Plunge",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/travel/turkey-kas-swimming.html,"Honestly, I didn't think our Mediterranean vacation could get much better. The dozen of us on the trip had already swum several miles a day through astonishing turquoise waters off Kas, a remote village on Turkey's southwest coast, where cliffs soar up from the sea, the soft air is scented with jasmine and views of the glimmering bay are downright therapeutic. Amid a ring of seven islands earlier in the week, our group of open-water swimmers glided alongside limestone coastlines, the sunlight spangling the underwater landscape of smooth boulders and serrated pillars. We swam over marine forests swaying in the current. We crossed into the open sea, pulling rhythmically through a panorama of royal blue, a laser show of sunbeams funneling into a gleaming ring in the depth. ""It's like swimming in the sky,"" my reluctant-swimmer wife, Susan, would say later in our breezy hotel room. Susan; our daughters, Jenna and Michaela; and I were on a weeklong adventure -- a swim vacation. It is a puzzling thing to many but is slowly gaining popularity among water lovers. The tours are a tiny sliver of one of the fastest-growing segments of tourism, so-called adventure travel, which typically involves some sort of physical activity, connection with nature and cultural immersion. Think of trekking through gorilla habitats in Rwanda or kayaking down the River Kwai in Thailand -- the antithesis of a package tour to Las Vegas.

Now, we were on the final leg of our longest single swim, a 5K international crossing from a large rock near the Greek island of Meis to the Kas peninsula, our guide Bruce Allender leading the way in a dinghy. I cruised through the pack looking for our daughters and saw them swimming side by side at the front. Ever since they were young, I had been trying to get these two to love swimming as much as I do. Both had reluctantly agreed to swim on their high school teams, but had no interest in chlorinated laps as young adults, now in their mid-20s. They didn't like swimming in lakes or at the beach, either, with little tolerance for critters, waves or cool, dark water.

I steered in between them, smiling in the clear, blue-green sea. We were arcing our cupped hands into the water in unison, catching views of one another with each breath. It was bliss. And it was followed by another magical moment, when I swam the next day in sync with a large sea turtle that surely was inviting me to hitch a ride. Our family agreed that it was our best holiday ever. Not everything was perfect, of course. I would have preferred actually stepping onto the isle of Meis to start the Greece-to-Turkey swim instead of hopping from the boat a long way offshore. (That shore-to-shore crossing is undertaken by locals in an annual race in June -- and at night by refugees passing through Turkey to seek asylum in Greece. Ali Gumrukcu, the captain of the daily ferry between Kas and Meis, said that of the roughly 400 refugees crossing the water into Greece each month, most of them from Syria, 10 to 20 brave the swim, waiting for nights with no moonlight so they would be undetected.) There were confusing moments when a local competitor of SwimTrek veered his big boat toward one of our dinghies and yelled threats. And then there were the two fighting dogs that crashed through the doorway of a dance bar and nearly bowled me over. Like most people, we had never heard of a swim vacation. When Jenna visited us in London in 2014 and arranged a hiking tour in Portugal, I wondered if there were such a thing for swimming, too. We went online and, sure enough, several companies offered trips.

His association, based in Seattle, jointly published the United Nations World Tourism Organization's latest global report on adventure tourism. It noted how spending had surged in recent years as travelers increasingly sought authentic experiences in remote locales. Swimming wasn't on the association's list of 34 adventure activities, from backpacking to caving to safaris. But swim tours, he said, are in sync with the growing number of people and travel businesses customizing trips and combining interests like hiking and bird-watching, cycling and wine. ""It's engaging in immersive experiences,"" Mr. Stowell said. It's ""so much more meaningful than the highly packaged tours."" Simon Murie came up with the idea for SwimTrek in 2000, when he spent a week organizing a trip to Turkey to swim the Hellespont, the fabled stretch of water between Europe and Asia described by Lord Byron and prominent in Greek mythology. The logistics were such a hassle he figured that others would be interested in the trip if someone else did all the work and they could just turn up and swim. He led his first tour in 2003, island-hopping in Greece. Since then, Mr. Murie said, the business has grown from 90 swimmers a year to more than 2,500 taking trips to more than 30 locations around the globe, including the Hellespont in late August. Interest in open-water swimming enjoyed a boost when it was added to the Beijing Olympics in 2008, and open-water races around the globe are flourishing. Several companies are adding swim tours, some in Turkey. ""It's going to be the next hot swimming spot, we think,"" said Hopper McDonough, who runs the American company SwimVacation, which this year added a Turkish coast swim tour to its Hawaii and yacht-based British Virgin Islands trips. Kas, which dates back to antiquity and has a bohemian vibe, is popular with swimmers because of the dramatic setting of mountains and Mediterranean -- its waters clean, calm and free of Jet Skis and sharks. It became popular with backpackers in the 1980s, later with divers, now with swimmers. People who take these tours have at least two common bonds -- swimming and a sense of adventure. Our group included a British design engineer, a Swedish geologist, a retired molecular biologist from New Zealand, a 30-something Irish couple who did the Ironman 140.6-mile triathlon in 2014, an English investor training for the Ironman, and his 17-year-old daughter. We all hit it off right away.

""It's like holidays as a child,"" she said. We started with a briefing under a rising full moon at a table outside our hotel. Our guides, Bruce, an Australian masters swimming coach, and Alice Williams, a British beach lifeguard, explained that we would be divvied up into three teams based on speed and that we'd never be more than a moment or two away from our escorts in boats. Our 7:30 a.m. orientation swim, hopping from a deck on the limestone ridge into jade-green water 20 feet deep, was meant to assess our abilities. But something was strange. The water was a bit cool, then suddenly ice-cold in large patches and blurry, as if baby oil had been poured in. We were swimming through what locals call sweet water, percolating down from mountaintops, pouring out cold and mineral rich through rock just below the surface. After breakfast at the hotel (weak coffee, delicious local tomatoes), we trooped down the narrow brick streets flanked by low-rise apartments and hotels, their balconies draped with thick strands of pink, white and blue bougainvillea. Under a hot sun at the harbor, we stepped onto the gulet -- a 46-foot cross between a tiny yacht and a giant pontoon -- owned and piloted by Mustafa and Zeynep Sarica. We motored 25 minutes to a peninsula. The sea was a slightly chilly 77 degrees. Our three groups stuck close to the rocky coastline to avoid the current. At times we swam a foot or two above the cragged shelves of submerged rock, as if soaring over canyons. We would swim about 20 minutes and stop to rest and drink from water bottles or to check out a turtle floating below, some passing trumpet fish or another otherworldly seascape. When we emerged onto the teak-slatted deck after an hour or so, me shivering, hot tea never tasted better. The grilled chicken and fresh salads prepared by Zeynep for lunch seemed more flavorful. Later, Bruce and Alice videotaped our strokes from above the water and below for technique pointers. Jane Evans, from outside of Dublin, joked that in Ireland they say there are 50 shades of green; here, there are 50 shades of blue. One of my favorite routes was the archipelago swim. One minute we were peering underwater at the waves plowing fizzily into an island's limestone bank; the next, we were in open sea more than 100 feet deep, as if drifting through an indigo dome, with no bottom in sight.

The day with the most variety was our swim and hike at the ruins of Aperlai, which long ago made a rare purple dye for the Roman empire. An earthquake about A.D. 600 submerged part of the town, and we swam over the outlines of the storehouses for the shells that held the prized pigment. On the way to the ruins, tilting my head to breathe on the right, the view reminded me of the Delaware Water Gap in the Poconos, the dark green mountainside towering against the bright blue sky. Breathing to the left, I was back in the Mediterranean, the shoreline hemmed by thick ridges of white and gray limestone that sloped into the crystalline water. Climbing up a steep, rock-rutted trail, we stopped to inspect large stone tombs with curved lids and posed for group pictures against ancient crumbling walls. From the highest point on the hill, the shallow bay was a kaleidoscope of aquamarine and electric blue, the boat like a little toy in the water below. On the last full day of swimming, I was exploring an azure bay after lunch when I came across a dark circle, maybe 25 feet below. I took a deep breath and scooped down through the water, every six feet or so pinching my nose and blowing out to pop my ears -- a tip I got from Mike, the retired scientist. A geometric pattern of a shell sharpened as I descended to the floor, and I fanned my fingers across its ridges. The turtle rose up slowly as I rushed to the surface for air. When I came back under it was floating as if in slow motion, flapping prehistoric-looking fins, banking to the left. I glided above, mimicking its underwater flight, as sunlight flickered across its shield. We swam for eight minutes, me several feet above, plunging down to rub its shell. The turtle kept close. It was almost as if it were welcoming me to latch on. So I did. For three rides, several seconds each, swooping through an ocean of velvety blue.

The tours generally range from one to eight days with eight to 14 swimmers and routes of two to three kilometers, twice a day. Weeklong tours start about $1,000 a person, including hotel, boat and daytime meals but not flights, dinners or tips. The pricier tours are based on boats. Swimmers are often in their 30s to 50s, though ages range from 16 to the 80s, and as many are single as couples and families. Some operators also offer private tours. Travel insurance is required. What to Consider It's best to have some open-water swimming experience to get the most out of a trip; even avid pool swimmers can get freaked out when surrounded by the sea with no bottom visible. But tour operators cater to both advanced and novice swimmers and offer stroke analysis and coaching. Swimming in the sea can be easier than in a pool because of the buoyancy, and there are fins to speed the pace. How Safe Is It? The locations usually feature clear, relatively calm water free of watercraft and sharks. The tour guides are certified beach lifeguards with first aid training and powerboat licenses. They say the biggest hazards can be Jet Skis, jelly fish, sudden storms and swimmer fatigue. Bring a rash guard and a lot more sunscreen than you think you will need. SwimTrek (swimtrek.com) is the largest operator with more than 30 destinations. Trips run January to November, from a one-day swim at Alcatraz to eight days in the Greek Sporades. SwimQuest (swimquest.uk.com) offers tours from Britain to Thailand, as well as coaching weeks in the Mediterranean with the Olympic open-water medalist Cassie Patten.",Open-water swimming in places like ancient Turkey joins the ranks of options for adventure vacations.,1dcd26ad-5bc9-57e8-a33e-c9e18ba8d984,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/travel/14SWIM1/14SWIM1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=ef988aab6ff5df02c95563e33e7b2547deba2f372f4391fba300a3059e9cfcc3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A SwimTrek group in Turkish waters.,1dcd26ad-5bc9-57e8-a33e-c9e18ba8d984,N24News/imgs/1dcd26ad-5bc9-57e8-a33e-c9e18ba8d984.jpg,4
Automobiles,N.H.T.S.A. Reports Increased Traffic Deaths,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/automobiles/nhtsa-reports-increased-traffic-deaths.html,"More people died on United States roads in 2012 than in 2011, according to a report from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Motorcyclist and pedestrian deaths each increased for the third year in a row, and deaths of bicyclists reached the highest level in six years. Over all, however, traffic deaths continue to be at historic lows.

Fatalities in 2011 were at their lowest level since 1949. The 2012 increase could not be attributed to Americans driving more, because motorists drove nearly the same number of miles in 2012 as they did in 2011, according to the report. Highway deaths increased to 33,561 in 2012, according to the safety agency's 2012 Fatality Analysis Reporting System, known as FARS. That is 1,082 - or 3.3 percent - more than the 2011 figure. The majority of the increase occurred in the first quarter of 2012, which the report notes was the warmest in history.

The estimated number of people injured rose as well, by 6.5 percent, in what N.H.T.S.A. described in its report as a ""statistically significant change"" from 2011. There did not seem to be one single issue that explained the increases - according to the federal agency, which released the data - and some crashes associated with traditional risk factors even fell. For example, the number of young drivers involved in fatal crashes continued to decline.

Here are some of the conclusions the agency reached:

# Of those killed in passenger vehicles in 2012, 52 percent were not wearing seatbelts.

# Pedestrian deaths were 6.4 percent higher than in 2011, and they increased for the third consecutive year. Most occurred in urban areas, away from intersections, at night, and many involved alcohol.","Traffic deaths were up in 2012 over 2011, but the federal  agency says they are still near historic lows.",8d09e235-d669-5682-8893-8603baf984bd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/11/16/automobiles/16TRAFFICDEATHS-image/16TRAFFICDEATHS-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=339&w=600&s=139eed759e9da86e9dfb69324230a6404b3a1d2533be926b3a13eeedeb034711&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Four people died in this crash in Yuba City, Calif., on Nov. 12.

Health,"Food Companies Have Cut Back on Calories, Study Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/01/09/health/food-companies-have-cut-back-on-calories-study-says.html,"How big a difference does cutting 78 calories out of an American's daily diet make? It may depend on who's counting. That is the average amount a day that a study by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation said was the result of a five-year reduction of calories (totaling 6.4 trillion) in sales of food and beverages by 16 major companies. The tally was assessed through a foundation grant to University of North Carolina, and was part of a years-long effort by the nonprofit organization to reduce childhood obesity in the United States. The companies involved, as varied as Bumble Bee Foods and Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, account for 36 percent of the calories in all packaged foods and beverages sold.

Dr. James S. Marks, senior vice president with responsibility for the foundation's health group, said he was encouraged by the progress made beyond the companies' original pledge to drop caloric contents in their products by 1 trillion calories by 2010. ""Now we hope that others see the success these companies have had and make the same commitment."" Nestle has marketed its Edy's ""Slow Churned"" ice cream as having less fat. Food policy experts were less impressed. Companies have been under intense pressure by consumers who are shunning high-calorie, high-fat foods in search of healthier alternatives. Nutritionists noted that the study may paint a rosier picture of calorie reduction because its starting point was 2007, when grocery store sales were strong, rather than in 2009 when the companies began planning their program and the recession had put a dent in such sales. The analysis also does not account for meals Americans eat in restaurants, where they could be consuming more calories. Nor does it distinguish between a reduction in calories that is attributable to company efforts and those that consumers have simply made on their own.

""It's great to see companies selling fewer calories and reformulating their products to reduce fat and sugar, but it's hard to know how much is due to the proactive efforts of the industry rather than changes in Americans' eating habits, "" said Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""It's not as if Coke and Pepsi are encouraging people to drink less soda -- in fact, Coke and Pepsi are lobbying against state and local policies aimed at reducing consumption of soda."" Nonetheless, Ms. Wootan said a reduction of 78 calories a day was significant, whoever is responsible. ""The whole obesity epidemic can be explained by an extra 100 to 150 calories a day,"" she said. Sales of the processed foods that typically line the long rows in the center of grocery stores have been stagnant, and beverage companies have been scrambling as consumers abandon sugary carbonated drinks for water and diet varieties. ""I see an evolution in the way consumers are looking at foods and beverages they purchase,"" said Chavanne Hanson, a dietitian and nutritionist who serves as ""wellness champion"" at Nestle USA, one of the 16 companies. ""That challenges us, which is great for us and great for society because of how important it is to address the issue of calorie balance and the concerns we have from a public health standpoint about obesity and weight."" General Mills has offered its Yoplait Greek 100 yogurt, with 100 calories. Other companies also started ""healthy"" foods. To that end and toward their goal, companies have shrunk package sizes, eliminated oils, reduced sugar and salt and introduced new products. Campbell's, for example, introduced a number of ""light"" products, like Campbell's Homestyle Light Italian Wedding Soup and diet V8 V-Fusion Plus Energy drinks with 10 calories in an 8-ounce serving. Jimmy Dean, a division of Hillshire Brands, began selling sausage crumbles made from turkey.

""Companies like these with a higher percentage of sales coming from 'better for you' products show strong growth, higher profits and better corporate reputations,"" Dr. Marks said. ""That connection between offering healthier products and doing better in the marketplace is a message all of the food industry needs to heed."" Nestle, for example, developed a new, proprietary technology to make what it calls ""Slow Churned"" Edy's and Dreyer's ice creams. ""We were able to make an ice cream with half the fat and one-third of calories just by the process we used to create it,"" said Ms. Hanson of Nestle. She said the company was now selling almost as much of the Slow-Churned products as it does its basic ice cream products. Nestle also reduced the sugar in Nesquik by 25 percent; used seasonings and flavorings to help it reduce the oil in some of the sauces used in its Lean Cuisine and Stouffer's frozen food products; and began packaging its Haagen-Dazs and other ice creams in single-serve cups. ""These things help consumers be mindful of how much they are consuming,"" Ms. Hanson said. The introduction of Yoplait Greek 100, a 100-calorie version of its Greek yogurt, was the largest new product debut in 20 years for the brand, said Kris Patton, a spokeswoman for General Mills, its corporate parent, with $150 million in sales its first year.",A study found there were trillions of fewer calories in the foods sold by 16 large companies. But some were skeptical that corporate effort alone was the cause.,66d0cc11-01f9-5367-b1fe-124cc2a96d1a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/01/09/business/Calories1/Calories1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=662&w=600&s=ad01feef919f134b5a773be2a6e2fbe77a8cbf0b47b05c9759f5f8de9920abfd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Nestlé has marketed its Edy's ""Slow Churned"" ice cream as having less fat.",66d0cc11-01f9-5367-b1fe-124cc2a96d1a,N24News/imgs/66d0cc11-01f9-5367-b1fe-124cc2a96d1a.jpg,1

Dance,"Review: A Cuban Troupe's Strong Dancers, Less Strong Premieres",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/18/arts/dance/malpaso-dance-company-joyce-review.html,"It was a bold move when Osnel Delgado and Daileidys Carrazana left Danza Contemporanea de Cuba to form their own company, with Fernando Saez, in 2012. And it was even cheekier when they named their troupe after the Spanish word for ""misstep."" Malpaso Dance Company, returning to the Joyce Theater on Wednesday, is a leading contemporary group in Cuba. But while its dancers remain driven and invigorating, the three works on the Joyce program, including New York premieres by Aszure Barton and Sonya Tayeh, paid unintentional homage to the company's name: They were missteps. At times, Ms. Barton's ""Indomitable Waltz,"" which she described in a program interview as an ""intimate exploration of the soul,"" had a somber, contemplative approach. (When she was creating it, her father was ill.) But little about it felt persuasive until the final solo when Dunia Acosta was left alone to inch her way across the stage with swiveling steps and measured moments of stillness.

Set to music by the Balanescu Quartet, Michael Nyman and Nils Frahm, ""Indomitable Waltz"" unfolded as a series of vignettes with flipping moods that made it difficult to pin down what emotion Ms. Barton was after. Sometimes yearning, sometimes playful -- typically (and annoyingly) whenever the women were featured -- its manner was both bumpy and predictable.

It wasn't difficult to grasp where she was going with her movement, which was highlighted by loose joints: Knees bent into deep plies and arms rippled out like slippery fabric. The men, at times, became rubbery acrobats, bending, buckling and then springing back to life. But where was the composition? The frequent sight of evenly spaced dancers, dressed simply in grays and blacks, was overly static. By the time Ms. Acosta's solo rolled around, it seemed as if the dance was finally starting. It was too late. After ""Ocaso,"" a duet by Mr. Delgado that he performed with Ms. Carrazana -- a disappointing array of emotionless embraces and melting falls to the floor -- the program closed with Ms. Tayeh's ""Face the Torrent."" Set in an apocalyptic world, it featured eight dancers moving from the back to the front of the stage over and over again under hazy spotlights. This repeated action -- steps in slow motion -- was more menacing than mesmerizing. Throughout, the dancer Abel Rojo, striking and sinuous, slipped out of the group clutching his head or hinging down to the floor. A score by the cellist Colette Alexander, with the musical group the Bengsons, featured whispered words -- among them ""quivering"" and ""shivering"" -- that gradually became clear with repetition.

""Face the Torrent"" did send a certain chill down the spine, but it shouldn't have lasted longer than a music video.

Travel,The Accidental Winemakers of Mendoza,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/10/travel/the-accidental-winemakers-of-mendoza.html,"On a hot summer afternoon in the Uco Valley, south of Mendoza, Argentina, last December, six of us gathered for a wine blending of malbec, cabernet franc and syrah grapes that had been harvested nine months earlier. Our task: to decide what to do with the juice that had been aging in oak barrels for several months. As Mariana, our winemaker, guided us through the tastes and smells of the 2014 harvest, we stopped to take in the view of the majestic Andes Mountains in the distance. Agritourism may be big in these parts but we were taking it one step further than most: The wine we were blending was from our own vineyard. Enthralled by the region nine years ago, New York family members and friends with no experience in winemaking banded together to find an excuse to revisit it year after year. The price was $100,000, but not enough for the two other principal buyers and me to buy a house. This year, we will produce our fourth vintage, enabling us to share our wine and our tales of owning a vineyard in a faraway part of the world. How had we become accidental winemakers in the booming Argentine wine country? The first step was falling in love with Mendoza. It isn't hard to do. Mendoza is a leafy city founded in 1561 by Spanish settlers. The combination of lovely squares and wide boulevards adds to the colonial feel, as does an intricate web of canals running through the city. The place is alive with adventure travelers and oenophiles.

I first visited the region in 2006 with two friends, Tom and Cap. During our stay at the Cavas Wine Lodge, a Relais & Chateaux hotel 30 minutes from the city, we visited a dozen vineyards. We also fit in some hiking and horseback riding in the foothills of the Andes, then dined under the vines at Cavas. Our group went on to Santiago for a wedding, but my heart stayed in the Mendoza region. Anytime I heard that someone was heading there, I would ask them to come back with suggestions on how I might invest in the area. A friend, Martha, hit on the intriguing idea of opening our own winery. She had met Michael Evans, an American who traveled there for vacation in 2004, but decided to stay. He joined forces with a local Argentine, Pablo Gimenez Rilli, and the winemaker Santiago Achaval to establish a new business model for winemaking.

Vines of Mendoza would be a 1,000-acre operation that would produce its own wine, and sell land to commercial producers, including restaurateurs who could create their own exclusive wines. And they would make three-to-10-acre parcels available to private investors. The concept was that you could contract with the main company in a land purchase, select the grapes you wanted to plant and then piggyback onto all of the master vineyard's winemaking services for planting, harvesting and bottling your own wine. Today the ""going-in"" cost ($85,000 an acre) covers everything up to the first bottling of the first harvest. While there are other private ownership communities throughout the region, such as Casa de Uco and Dragonback Estate, creating an easy way for investors to become a part of the scene, Vines had a big vision for itself. A day with Mr. Evans exploring the property on horseback, followed by an authentic Argentine asado (barbecue), is all it took to convince me that I could create my own wine. While he explained how the private ownership terms worked, I thought of the line from the lyricist and novelist Paulo Coelho, ""life was always a matter of waiting for the right moment to act!""

Fortunately, I have a lot of friends who love wine, particularly Jack and Jay, each of whom has his own wine cellar. When I returned home, I lobbied hard, talking them into investing in a vineyard. ""Let me get this right,"" Jack said. ""You want me to make an investment thousands of miles away in a place that I've never been to with people who I have never met?"" ""But Jack, you love wine,"" I said. ""Imagine your own wine label. What better time than now?"" Ultimately, he and Jay agreed that the idea was irresistible. Martha wanted in on it, too, and within weeks, JMJ (Jack, Michael, Martha, Jay) Vines LLC was born. We bought three acres to plant right away and another 10 acres that would remain fallow until we got our winemaking feet wet.

We didn't rush down and make our first pilgrimage to our vineyard together. But within the first year of our venture, all of the partners had taken trips to explore the land and mull over what we had done. I remember standing on the barren land wondering if we had done the right thing. When I looked at the stunning scenery, I knew that this would become an adventure of a lifetime. During this trip, it was my job to work with the winemakers to decide what type of grapes we'd plant, and to communicate the choices back home. Sitting with a glass of malbec to make the final decision was what I called ""just another day at the vineyard."" 

We settled on growing malbec, Argentina's signature grape. (Over 70 percent of the world's malbec is grown there.) The grape was introduced to Argentina in the 1860s and has blossomed thanks to the terroir there, a combination of sun, heat, soil, altitude and temperature that ensures ripeness and acidity, important to the rich, velvety full-flavored wine that it is known for. Grown over a 2,000-mile stretch from Salta in the north to Patagonia in the south, the Argentine malbec has seduced the palate of wine drinkers everywhere.

We would plant an acre each of malbec, cabernet franc and syrah, although in hindsight, we should have planted all malbec, since owners can buy other grapes grown at Vines for blending to produce other types of wines. In 2008, I went back to Mendoza with a few friends to lead the ceremonial planting of the baby vines. It would take three years before we could blend our first wine. We would be able to produce 80 cases an acre from that first harvest. Once the vines matured in Years 5 and 6, production would swell to several hundred cases an acre. Since then, we have gone to the area at least once a year. We plan our visits around the harvest or blending season. Or we pick a holiday that we celebrate there. The 11-hour overnight flight from New York to Santiago with the 30-minute hop to Mendoza has also allowed us to do an occasional five-day weekend. Learning how to plant the vines, which could thrive for more than 75 years, we spent a few hours on our hands and knees, placing them in the earth, as farmers have done for centuries.

At home, we tasted dozens of malbecs from the region, hoping that someday we would capture some of the great fruits of blackberry, plum and black cherry with a hint of floral notes that create the perfect wine. In spring of 2011, as our first harvest approached, eight of us assembled to attend winemaking camp and participate in the harvest. We clipped and piled our plump grapes into large plastic bins. Jack and his wife, Amy, joined in, as did Martha, the proud birth mother of the idea, along with Tom. While Jay couldn't join us, we sent him videos of our group at work.

Our day of winemaking had bonded us in a way that none of us had anticipated, with shared moments that we talk about every time we see one another. Nine months later, most of our group headed back to Mendoza for the official blending of the grapes. Additional friends joined to partake in the winemaker's experience. Today, there are over 150 private vineyard owners at Vines, creating a global community, who communicate regularly. We've cheered one another on at marathons, celebrated weddings and births, and made toasts with our wines. We have learned that each year, the blending produces a different wine, as it depends on the weather conditions of the growing season. For 2014, Mariana predicted it would be a great year for malbec. We liked the taste of our grapes so much that we will produce four barrels (or 100 cases) of malbec, one barrel of syrah and our own blend of those two with cabernet franc that we named Founder's Reserve. To help finance the production, we sold 70 percent of our grapes on the Vines exchange. That helps us almost break even on our annual wine production. With the good luck from our Lechuza, our experience has been both fun and affordable. We expect that our wine will arrive in New York in September of this year, in time for family gatherings and the holidays. Lechuza is now my holiday gift to colleagues, clients and friends. We have all decided to keep our wine for our own use. A group of us will be in Argentina at least once a year for harvest or blending. Our investment has become a lot more than just owning a vineyard. It has enriched friendships, created new ones and established a place that we now call home.","In Argentine wine country, a group of New York friends invest in a vineyard, creating vintages in a place now as familiar as home.",c32abdf7-7071-52b0-9c3a-4493bec976af,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/10/travel/10ARGENTINA2/10ARGENTINA2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4361703ff046094e1957d412ce344872c7b9b5bfe966a5f364bd12014b767ff6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sampling the density and temperature of the wine.,c32abdf7-7071-52b0-9c3a-4493bec976af,N24News/imgs/c32abdf7-7071-52b0-9c3a-4493bec976af.jpg,4
Music,4 New Operas in 4 Months? Only in Berlin,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/24/arts/music/berlin-opera.html,"BERLIN -- No place on earth rivals Berlin for the volume and variety of opera on offer, from Georg Frideric Handel to Hans Werner Henze. The city has three world-class companies, which this season have combined for a total of 85 fully staged productions. And they are investing in new works to run alongside the old war horses. When Detlev Glanert's ""Oceane,"" inspired by a 19th-century novella about a woman who attempts to live outside patriarchal bourgeois society, has its premiere at the Deutsche Oper on April 28, it will be the third of four works taking their first bows here this season. Just a week later, the Komische Oper will present ""M: A City Searches For a Murderer"" by Moritz Eggert, based on the classic film thriller by Fritz Lang. Earlier this year, the Staatsoper presented Beat Furrer's ""Violetter Schnee"" and a completely revised version of Jorg Widmann's 2012 ""Babylon."" Matthias Schulz, the Staatsoper's general director, said in an interview that ""to show commissioned works is essential, to show that opera isn't just a museum. It's a living art form."" There are challenges inherent in adding new works to what remains a conservative field. While world premieres generate excitement among enthusiasts, attracting a general audience is tricky, and it is difficult for new operas to gain a foothold in the repertoire.

More often than not, it's here today and gone tomorrow for fresh commissions, even the most critically praised ones, which tend to present too much of a financial risk to revive past their first performances. State-funded opera houses don't need to be full every night to pay the bills. But administrators don't want to perform to half-empty houses. ""I don't just want my work to be done once,"" Mr. Glanert, the composer of ""Oceane,"" said in an interview. (And he has been fortunate, with multiple productions for most of his 10 operas.) Robert Carsen, who is directing ""Oceane,"" put it more bluntly: ""When I do a world premiere, I always say that I hope I'm not working on a world 'derniere.'""

Of Berlin's three opera houses, the Deutsche Oper has shown the most sustained commitment to new work. Its artistic director, Dietmar Schwarz, has scheduled a major contemporary opera each season since he took on that position in 2012, including three world premieres. But only one of those, Aribert Reimann's ""L'Invisible,"" is scheduled for revival -- on the occasion of its composer's 85th birthday in 2021. ""We think it's important to do it again,"" Mr. Schwarz said, ""but financially it will probably be difficult.""

Mr. Widmann, the composer, said he didn't know after its premiere seven years ago in Munich if ""Babylon"" ""would ever be performed again. So many new pieces, especially monstrously complex pieces, never are. I'm very grateful for this house's trust to give this crazy piece another chance."" (Mr. Widmann completely revised the work, a Biblical epic, to produce a new ""Berlin version."") According to the Staatsoper, ticket sales were strong for both ""Babylon"" and ""Violetter Schnee,"" an intense and mysterious 100-minute work about people trapped in an apocalyptic snowstorm, even if they received mixed reviews. The company will revive both works in coming seasons. ""When we do efforts like that, and they are successful, we have to bring them back,"" Mr. Schulz said. Companies attempt to attract audiences to these new works by promoting them as central events of the season. But working on them, said Mr. Carsen, the director, is always a leap into the unknown. ""I always approach anything I'm directing as if it's just been written,"" he said. ""And I want people to hear it and see it as if they've never seen it or heard it before. Which is, of course, the case with a world premiere.""

""If the audience feels it's performed and sung fantastically and if it touches their hearts,"" he said, ""then the modern musical language should not be a barrier."" Mr. Eggert, the composer of ""M,"" said, ""Many people expect to suffer through a new opera. It's a challenge for everyone, for the audience and the composers as well: how to create new works that can be understood without reading lengthy program notes."" His 90-minute score contains an enormous children's chorus, spoken dialogue, synthesizers, and sound effects to evoke the big city. Barrie Kosky, the artistic director of the Komische Oper and the director of the production, said he asked the composer to channel the Weimar-style spirit of Kurt Weill. Mr. Kosky said this was ""a deliberate attempt to create a link with the Berlin music-theater history, and as a 'Gesamtkunstwerk'"" -- a ""total work of art"" -- ""it goes in a completely different direction than what Detlef Glanert or Beat Furrer or Jorg Widmann does."" But whether ""M"" would come back in a future season, he couldn't say. Mr. Glanert said that it's only natural for it to take time for audiences to become acclimated to the new. ""Music is performed, evaluated and flops, or is performed again,"" he said. ""That's the life cycle of any piece of music. And I think this is normal.""

""In fact,"" he added, ""I'm appalled that it doesn't happen."" The polemics to this effect that appear on his blog inspire some hate mail, but also support, especially from people who work in the field. ""Something has to change,"" he said. Mr. Kosky said he had reservations. ""We have a duty, of course, to replenish the repertoire, but there are always questions hanging over my head,"" he said. ""Are the proscenium and the orchestra pit really the future of opera in the 21st century? Are we just creating these works for institutions? Do we all create them because we're worried desperately that our Dracula-like dependence on 400 years of repertoire is going to come to an end if we don't find new pieces?"" Although his house is rolling out the red carpet for ""M,"" Mr. Kosky said his first allegiance is to the classics. ""I am a signed-up member of the opera necrophiliacs club,"" he said. ""I can't survive without my Mozart, Puccini and Richard Strauss."" Mr. Widmann, whose work deftly blends contemporary and historical styles, said he resisted writing operas when he was younger, but now felt it was his duty. ""I need this as a composer, and the audience needs it, too,"" he said. ""To me, the whole opera system would not make sense at all if you only play the same old operas over and over again.""

He is fortunate to be surrounded by supportive institutions. ""We're very lucky that we have the money to do this,"" said Mr. Schwarz, of the Deutsche Oper. ""It's very important that you have this kind of art, which is not commercial. That we haven't yet found a contemporary work that can be part of the repertory over the past 40 years doesn't mean that we should give up."" (The important works of Philip Glass and John Adams are slowly making inroads in Germany.) Mr. Kosky said he isn't giving up on world premieres, either, but he's thinking beyond classically-trained composers. He wanted the next one he worked on to be ""an operetta. But I want a great rock band or a brilliant jazz composer to do it."" ""I'm sorry,"" he added. ""I'm an old showgirl and I like a bit of a tune.""",The opera season in many cities goes by without a single new work.

Fashion & Style,"In Myanmar, a Glittering Heritage",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/05/fashion/jewelry-myanmar.html,"YANGON, Myanmar -- When Thiri Tin Htut was growing up here in the 1970s, she and her three sisters would play by pretending to sell each other gemstones. But the rubies and sapphires in their small hands were real, she recalled, and her parents allowed the game only after their daughters were old enough to not swallow the merchandise. Myanmar's precious stones are known abroad for their exceptionally high quality, and Ms. Thiri Tin Htut's family has been in the gem business since the 19th century: Her great-great-grandfather, U Hmat, was the chief ruby miner for Thibaw, the country's last imperial king, and later generations worked as gem miners or traders in Myanmar, Thailand and Europe. So when Ms. Thiri Tin Htut returned to Myanmar in 1995 after living for a decade in Thailand, Switzerland and the United States, opening an artisanal jewelry boutique with one of her sisters seemed like a natural career move, she said.

""I had a lot of gemstones to play around with, so I could be creative,"" Ms. Thiri Tin Htut, 44, said on a recent afternoon at the boutique, Manawmaya House of Jewels. ""I was not confined to making mainstream commercial stuff."" Over two decades, Manawmaya House of Jewels, which operates in a residential neighborhood of Yangon, Myanmar's cultural and business capital, has quietly emerged as a destination for jewelry enthusiasts from Myanmar and beyond. Its nondescript exterior makes it look like an ordinary residence. But the two-floor showroom inside has glass cabinets full of jewelry that sparkles with rare rubies and sapphires, along with other precious and semiprecious stones. All of the jewelry is handmade on the premises by a dozen craftspeople, and about 90 percent of the gemstones are from Myanmar, Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said. Her prices start at about $2,000 per piece.

Some customers ask her to repeat designs, she added, but she always refuses. ""I say, 'I can make it similar, but not exactly the same,' "" she said. ""I prefer not to, because I want everyone who buys a piece of jewelry from me to feel special and unique."" Ms. Thiri Tin Htut is opinionated and independent, ""and it somehow comes through in the pieces,"" said M. H. Au, a client in Hong Kong who discovered Manawmaya House on a trip to Yangon in 2014. Ms. Au said in a telephone interview that the boutique's jewelry blends traditional and contemporary styles in a way that sets it apart from both local jewelry markets and international brands. ""I have to say, I was really pleasantly surprised,"" she said. Human rights groups have long maintained that the country's gem mines, many of which have ties to the Myanmar Army, are havens for abuse and corruption. A 2003 United States law banned the import of jade and rubies from Myanmar, with conditions, and the ban was strengthened through additional rules passed during the administrations of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. But Myanmar has undergone a dramatic political transition since 2012, when its first free parliamentary election in decades ended a long and painful period of military rule. Since then, the United States has been gradually easing the economic sanctions that it had imposed on many sectors of Myanmar's economy.

In September, President Obama said he had decided to lift all remaining sanctions against Myanmar, also known as Burma, in part to show support for the political reform process. ""It is the right thing to do in order to ensure that the people of Burma see rewards from a new way of doing business and a new government,"" he said, sitting in the Oval Office beside Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, a former political prisoner and Nobel laureate who is now Myanmar's de facto leader. Mr. Obama canceled the sanctions for good in October. The same month, a delegation of American jewelry executives visited Myanmar's gem-producing capital, Mogok, in an effort to promote what they called ""responsible commerce."" Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said that she welcomed the lifting of the American sanctions and hoped the move would lead to more transparency in Myanmar's gemstone sector. But for her, gems and jewelry have always been more personal than political. She said that people in her family talk of a legend in which her great-great-grandfather, Mr. Hmat, heard a voice urging him to climb atop his village hut at midnight.

Competition from other Yangon jewelry shops is increasing as Myanmar's economy opens up, she said, and it is unclear whether anyone from the next generation of her family will eventually take over the business. But compared with her eldest daughter, she added, her younger one, who is 13, so far seems ""a bit more keen on jewelry."" ""She likes making and wearing"" it, Ms. Thiri Tin Htut said. ""That's a good start.""",A jewelry designer's ancestor was chief ruby miner for the country's last imperial king.,eb2390f2-57f7-5945-af3c-850ea0d13f0e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/05/style/05myanmar01-inyt/05myanmar01-inyt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b0d54e5e17cc725924b2d0af107a3728c3833263d9e7e2322a7b30e136c4f88d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Thiri Tin Htut, managing director of Manawmaya House of Jewels, in Yangon, Myanmar.",eb2390f2-57f7-5945-af3c-850ea0d13f0e,N24News/imgs/eb2390f2-57f7-5945-af3c-850ea0d13f0e.jpg,19
Style,Catwalk Crashers at Chanel. Animal Sex at Stella.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/01/style/chanel-alexander-mcqueen-stella-mccartney-paris-fashion-week.html,"PARIS -- The morning of Jacques Chirac's funeral the sun came out. There was an autumn crispness to the air and Paris was, on Monday , as it is wont to be at such times, gleaming with pomp and a sense of circumstance past. President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia was in town; so was President Bill Clinton . So were a number of other world leaders, come to pay their respects to a man who once led France. As a crowd gathered for the Sacai show in the Grand Palais, a motorcade went by. The fashion gang watched the black cars and the accompanying vehicles, and then filed upstairs to discover -- George Clinton, the Parliament Funkadelic founder , sitting front row. It was a less jarring segue than it sounds. The designer Chitose Abe had taken the band's album, ""One Nation Under a Groove,"" as the inspiration for a collection that was effectively an argument for unity: of big oversize trousers and hard-core trench coats and sheer, weightless blouses spliced into a single jumpsuit; of many, many different size polka dots; of cartographic prints, flickering hither and yon on the points of scarf dresses and suits.

We are the world! Or at least the world map. It was fitting. This is a time to come together. Or at least mostly it is: The security guards at Chanel were less keen to embrace the catwalk crasher who ran down the bleachers to hop into the final parade across the roofs-of-Paris set that the designer Virginie Viard had created in the Grand Palais. She turned out to be a French YouTuber and comedian known as Marie S'Infiltre, doing her thing. Ms. Viard, however, seems to have not yet found her thing. She has the unenviable job of following the legend that was Karl Lagerfeld, and is certainly going through the motions of continuity, from the big sets to the classic Chanel boucle-and-pearl-isms, petite Parisienne coats and dresses. And she is trying for an update. But shorts -- short coat-rompers, metallic pink leather matching shorts and jackets, teeny black Lycra ... hot pants? paired with sparkling tops and a chain belt -- do not currency (or youth) make.

Save that last combo, which was so subversively peculiar, it was kind of fun, and the final looks, which combined completely casual long skirts and shirts with sparkling silver embroidery like a blase shrug in face of fancy, it all feels very minor. The motions are there, but there's no oomph. The soul and animating wit that extended from Coco to Karl are missing. They need to be reunited.

It was unexpected, for example, to arrive at the Opera Garnier, the Second Empire theater with a Chagall ceiling , for Stella McCartney 's show and discover that all over the gold interior there were videos playing of bears and zebras and monkeys and armadillos (and other kinds of animals) -- enthusiastically engaged in the act of procreation. That's one way to underscore the importance of communion. Another is basing the cut of a simple blouse or pair of trousers or lace dress on the circle, as Ms. McCartney did in scalloped cottons that curved around the arms and legs, potentially unforgiving volumes she aerates with ease, mixed in with cool safari suiting and loose halter dresses covered in photographic flower field prints she shot during on a bike ride in the countryside.

It's also a lot of symbolism for clothes to contain, and these particular clothes didn't, entirely -- they mostly just looked cool and uncomplicated to wear -- but in case you missed it (and maybe it doesn't matter, if consumers get the clothes) on every seat was a green (duh) paper detailing Ms. McCartney's milestones when it came to sustainability: PVC-free, angora-free, mohair-free, plastic-bottle free, solar panels in stores and so on. She has been a proponent of animal rights since she founded her business, and increasingly an activist trying to wake fashion up to climate change. Mostly, the industry has decided to join her.

Yet, in focusing so much on materials, legitimate as that is, another dimension of sustainability tends to be overlooked: the part that is not simply about chemistry and landfill but also community, communication, employment, the passing on of tradition. As Sarah Burton at Alexander McQueen made clear in a collection rooted in the nexus of man and earth and sky, where another kind of extinction was in the offing. It opened with a simple puffed-sleeve dress in white linen, which had been naturally bleached by being left outside in the sun. And it ended with skinny black pants under a jacket lavishly draped in what turned out to be toiles reimagined as oily beetled linen (beetling being a once-common process in which fabric is painted with potato starch and then pounded by large wooden blocks).",Extinction at Alexander McQueen.

Television,'Mr. Robot' Series Finale Recap: The Real Thing,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/23/arts/television/mr-robot-series-finale-recap.html,"Let's talk about what the series finale of ""Mr. Robot"" isn't. First and foremost, it is not a story of parallel dimensions and alternate realities. At least, not insofar as these things exist anywhere outside the mind. Despite appearances to the contrary, Whiterose's huge MacGuffin didn't send Elliot Alderson to a new world where the problems of the old one have been wiped clean. That doesn't stop him -- the Elliot we know, the one with the black hoodie -- from wandering around inside a place that sure looks like an alternate reality, though. In fact, the first half of the series's two-part conclusion backtracks from where the previous episode left off, showing us how our version of Elliot wound up in the shiny happy alternate Elliot's apartment. It turns out that both Elliots exist simultaneously. This leads to a lot of confusion when our Elliot visits his childhood home and encounters his mother, or goes to his beloved Angela's apartment and encounters her parents, including a friendly retiree version of the E Corp chief executive Phillip Price. But there's a sinister edge to all these encounters. After all, Elliot's mother abused him, as did his father, and they're both dead; here they're cheery, loving, living parents, and yet Elliot's sister Darlene is nowhere to be found. And every time the two Elliots brush against each other, earthquakes erupt.

After one such tremor, the new Elliot falls and hits his head on his radiator, paralyzing him. And our Elliot -- who has taken to looking right into the camera when his voice-over narration addresses us directly -- kills him in order to take his place and marry Angela, the woman he loves. This plan falls apart pretty rapidly. A cop who is a dead ringer for the F.B.I. agent Dom DiPierro stops Elliot as he tries to load his alternate self's corpse into his car. When Elliot flees to Coney Island, where the wedding is to take place, he's greeted by a wedding party full of people in fsociety's trademark money-man masks. Before long he's seeing the face of his alternate personality Mr. Robot on every passerby, like something out of an Aphex Twin video or ""Being John Malkovich."" The E Corp executive Tyrell Wellick appears to shoot him and bury him in a shallow grave. Angela leads him to fsociety's old headquarters, where she tells him that he's not Elliot: ""You're the Mastermind,"" she says cryptically. Whiterose's machine did not somehow create a better world. If it wasn't clear already, a segment in which some kind of mental avatar in the form of Elliot's therapist, Krista, makes it so: This is all in Elliot's head. But never mind the walk-back from the science-fictional explanation of this new world: The show has something even bolder in mind. Over the course of the finale's second half, a major ""everything you know is wrong"" revelation emerges.

Our Elliot is not the real Elliot at all. He is just one more alternate personality, the ""Mastermind"" who embodies Elliot's rage and thirst for vengeance against the 1 percent and its destructive system. He took over shortly before the beginning of the show's story, at which point he shunted Elliot's ""real"" personality into the placid alternate reality he entered after having been knocked unconscious when Whiterose's machine exploded. That's why that new world's Elliot is so happy, so successful, so surrounded by friends and by love. Our Elliot, the Mastermind, needed to keep the real Elliot someplace that was part paradise, part prison -- a place where he would be safe, yes, but also where he would feel no need to escape and retake control. It's the Mastermind incarnation of Elliot who wakes up in the hospital, his sister, Darlene, by his side. After informing Elliot that he has been credited with stopping a nuclear meltdown, destroying the machine (which never fully activated) and saving the world, she confesses that she knew she had been dealing with someone other than the real Elliot -- ""the one I grew up with,"" as she puts it -- all along. She kept silent because she treasured the time this Elliot wanted to spend with her, after she had pushed his true self away. The episode concludes with our ""Mastermind"" Elliot joining the other manifestations of his shattered psyche -- his abusive mother; his inner child; his protective Mr. Robot; and ""the voyeurs,"" a.k.a. us, in the audience -- as they willingly retreat into oblivion. Esmail represents this with the light from a movie projector, which becomes a dizzying vortex of blurred images, a ""2001"" star gate at 24 frames per second. Then Elliot -- the real Elliot -- wakes up again, and this time all we see is a close-up of one of his eyes, filled with tears. Darlene approaches and, looking directly into the camera, says ""Hello, Elliot."" And with that, it's goodbye, ""Mr. Robot."" But in a way we already said goodbye to ""Mr. Robot,"" or at least ""Mr. Robot"" as we knew it. The creator, writer and director Sam Esmail did not choose to end his series as a techno-thriller, or a deadly game of cat and mouse, or a science-fiction mind-bender, or a work of political agitprop. He -- and his luminous cast, particularly Rami Malek and Carly Chaikin as Elliot and Darlene -- ended it as an exploration of an alienated, mentally ill young man.

Elliot's psychological coping mechanisms may have been ... baroque, to say the least. But his underlying problems, from the childhood abuse to his fury at the condition of the world, are far from unique. Perhaps you share one, or both. In the end, the most tantalizing fantasy ""Mr. Robot"" places before us isn't a reckoning with the upper class or the creation of an alternate reality, it's the possibility of reintegrating our shattered selves and healing the breaches caused by the people, and the system, that have hurt us. No, I'm not fully convinced by Elliot's concluding declaration that standing our ground and refusing to change who we are is sufficient for changing the world for the better. I'm not even sure that it's sufficient for changing our individual lives for the better. But as another paranoid TV thriller once put it, I want to believe. And for making me want to believe, ""Mr. Robot"" has my thanks.",Sam Esmail's paranoid techno-thriller kept the major twists coming until the very end.,74d321cd-8e59-5091-adb1-eb360eb62430,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/22/arts/22mrrobot-recap/22mrrobot-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=524&w=1000&s=1a9407ab64bf021c36f2af7360906a22fca3c90cf240ffa93aa832072d84f4aa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rami Malek in Part 1 of the series finale of ""Mr. Robot.""",74d321cd-8e59-5091-adb1-eb360eb62430,N24News/imgs/74d321cd-8e59-5091-adb1-eb360eb62430.jpg,3
Books,Literary Nonprofit Buys Elizabeth Bishop's Key West Home,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/13/books/elizabeth-bishop-home-key-west.html,"Elizabeth Bishop lived in this house in Key West from 1938 to 1946. ""You can see the history right away,"" said Arlo Haskell, executive director of Key West Literary Seminar.





""The art of losing isn't hard to master,"" begins Elizabeth Bishop's poem ""One Art,"" followed by a recounting of her losses, which include ""three loved houses."" Now Key West Literary Seminar, a literature nonprofit that has championed the writer's work, is paying $1.2 million for the first of those houses, which she lived in for nearly a decade. It plans to use the Key West house as its headquarters. Arlo Haskell, the nonprofit's executive director, called Bishop, who died in 1979, its ""guiding spirit."" The organization devoted its 1993 seminar entirely to her writing, and more recently it has incorporated her letters, poems and photographs into its programming for young people.

Bishop is one of many American writers associated with Key West, Florida's southernmost island. The playwright Tennessee Williams and the novelist Ernest Hemingway, whose former home is now a museum, famously lived there. Ann Beattie, Joy Williams and Judy Blume, who runs a bookstore in the city, live there now. The opportunity to promote Bishop's work, Haskell said, in part feels like a ""feminist response to all the Hemingway energy that goes on here.""

Bishop, who was born in Worcester, Mass., in 1911, was deeply influenced by her time in Key West and by the house itself, said Thomas Travisano, whose biography of the poet, ""Love Unknown: The Life and Worlds of Elizabeth Bishop,"" was published by Viking this month.

Bishop was raised by different relatives; her father died when she was an infant, and her mother was put in a mental institution when Bishop was only 5. Travisano called her early poems ""fables of enclosure,"" based on her somewhat isolated upbringing. Those poems rarely mentioned the natural world directly, but that changed after she moved to Florida, he said. ""You suddenly have the natural world, and birds are clowning around, and you've got the sun and the sea and the sky,"" Travisano said. ""That quality carried over into all of her later work."" It was there that Bishop wrote most of her first poetry collection, ""North and South,"" which came out in 1946.

Bishop liked living near the ocean, a change of scenery from her upbringing in New England and Nova Scotia, where her mother's family was from. She liked the night life and the pace of the city, Travisano said. He added that it was also significant for Bishop to finally have a house of her own after a childhood of illness and abuse. ""This was the first place that she had a home,"" he said. Bishop later moved to Brazil and then back to Massachusetts, where she lived until her death at 68.","The poet lived on the Florida island for nearly a decade, and her former house will become the headquarters for Key West Literary Seminar.",f9a9c0dc-9579-5cf6-8e25-461e082af9da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/19/books/12Bishop11/merlin_164223222_4b820892-de63-459c-b0f1-64e36d472a9e-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2c1a0de1d0ffd9f809f34167a797b9fcb60bb83c18a1d9ee6034ce1edb22df90&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Elizabeth Bishop lived in this house in Key West from 1938 to 1946.

Food,Everyday Wines: The Most Important Bottles You Will Drink,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/dining/drinks/everyday-wines.html,"Books have been written about the marvels of Montrachet, the complexities of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti and the luscious wonders of Yquem, all remarkable wines that most people can only dream of being able to afford. Instagram is lined with photos of the proverbial unicorn wines, bottles so rare that they are sighted with the frequency of mystical animals. Somehow, these shots often seem to be posted by sommeliers, proving that such bottles are scarce only for those without access to other people's money. As much attention as is paid to the rare and profound bottles that fire the imagination, far less is devoted to the sorts of wines that people might actually consume at any given weeknight meal. Yet the bottles we might open every day are actually the most important wines in our lives, just as the art we live with in our homes is ultimately more meaningful than what we might see on an occasional visit to a museum.

The rare bottled masterpiece may stretch the mind, enlarging our notion of what wine can be and the emotions it can provoke. These special bottles, if we are lucky enough to drink one, occupy an exalted place because they set benchmarks and stretch context as they surprise and astound. But the simpler pleasures of everyday wines shape our attitudes and desires, pique the curiosity and fire the imagination. They forge our relationship with wine, and ultimately define its role in our lives. The joys of one cannot be understood without the pleasures of the other. Missing out on either side distorts the whole. But I would argue that for people who love wine or who want to understand it better, paying more attention to everyday wines rather than rare and expensive bottles can improve one's drinking life significantly. This especially holds true for wine authorities of all kinds. Rather than paying lip service every once in a while to ""good values"" or ""Tuesday night bottles,"" I would like to see regular, purposeful attention directed at everyday wines, good bottles that are moderately priced and easy to drink in relaxed, casual settings, yet are still interesting enough to inspire wonder and to be deeply pleasurable. The world is full of these sorts of wines, yet paradoxically they seem hard to come by. How can that be? Over the last 25 years, an explosion in diversity has blown apart the once-simple framework for getting to know and understand wine. Here in the United States, we now have access to more different sorts of wines than ever before, from more places, in more styles, made often from grapes that were largely unknown at the end of the 20th century.

But rather than make the job of finding and selecting a good, interesting bottle easier, this new diversity seems to have made it more difficult. So many choices can be confusing. Rather than take a chance on the unknown, many people choose instead to settle for familiar grapes, enticing brand names and well-known places. I have great sympathy with this point of view. We have only so much time and energy to absorb new ideas, especially in a world in which the unexpected arrives at frightening speed. Good food and good wine are not everybody's priority. Even if you would like it to be a more important part of your life, wine still comes in too many varieties and from too many places to comfortably and quickly absorb. So I would like to offer some practical recommendations to make it easier to drink better every day. Think of wine as food. If you care where your food comes from, how it's raised, grown or made and about its ethical and health consequences, apply that same logic to wine. You will end up with wine that is grown and made more conscientiously, with greater thought and care. Your wines will be less likely to be widgets and more likely to be expressions of culture. Topple wine off its pedestal. It's just a beverage, a pleasurable drink. It should be thought of as a staple of the table, like bread or olive oil. It's not just for special occasions, it's not only ceremonial, it does not require special tools to enjoy or unusual powers of taste or smell to know what's good and what's not. We know oysters are wonderful, for example, but some people cannot abide them, and the same is true with certain wines. It's just personal taste, not a judgment of one's personality or character. Think of the occasion, rather than what's at the top of a universal scale of greatness. Many might agree that grand cru Burgundy or first-growth Bordeaux or older Barolos are among the very best wines in the world. But those might not be the best wines for a weeknight, when you are tired and want a quick bite and an easygoing bottle. On those occasions, the very best wine might be a good Finger Lakes riesling, or a basic Etna Rosso, not a profound Chambertin. Find a good wine shop. This greatly increases the odds of finding good bottles, because conscientious merchants have weeded out much of the dreck. Avoid supermarkets and other indifferent outlets. Though you may find the occasional decent bottle, they are full of processed wines and vacuous brands that are the equivalent of empty calories.

Rely on merchants and sommeliers. Nobody knows the wares better than the merchants who buy them. In good shops, ask for help. Tell them your budget, maybe what you are cooking, or the kinds of foods you like to eat if you are buying more than a bottle or two. This direct approach is far more useful than looking at apps that aggregate scores or purport to discern your taste. Merchants want return business. Forging a good relationship will pay off sooner than you think. The same is true in restaurants, where good sommeliers are more concerned with your happiness than in upselling you to more expensive bottles. They want you back. Spend a little more. For $10, you can find many sound bottles, but I've long argued that at $15 to $20 the potential for quality and excitement increases exponentially. I realize that for many people that is a lot to spend on wine every day, or even every other day. But nonetheless, that's the reality of wine pricing. If it's too much, maybe try it once a week. Commit to diversity. I don't like to think in terms of house wines, likable bottles that are bought in bulk. So many great wines are available today that it seems a shame for the sole choice to be white or red. This is not to say that you should avoid buying age-worthy wines by the case. It's a great pleasure to drink the same bottles over the arc of their existence, to see how they evolve. That's a lot different from drinking the same wines every night. Explore. If you stick only with inexpensive versions of well-known, high-status grapes like pinot noir, chardonnay or cabernet sauvignon, you will rarely find good value. Many of these cheaper bottles are processed with technology or flavorings to imitate expensive bottles. Instead, you will find better values by seeking out honestly made wines from little-known grapes and largely unknown areas. If you can take these steps, you will be on your way to drinking much better. Other things can be helpful, like having some decent wine glasses. But nothing is more important than the wine itself. Good wine will still be good consumed from tumblers, but even the best glasses won't help a mediocre bottle. One more element will help to further the appreciation of everyday wines: Broaden the definition of greatness. Every worthy type of wine has a role to play. Pairing bottles to occasions is every bit as important as pairing wine with food. For too long, we have thought of great wines solely in terms of their potential to age, to evolve, to be profound and to be complex. These are all wonderful attributes, and they define wine at its highest level.","Much attention has been paid to profound bottles, with their complexity and ability to age. But it's time to focus on the ones we encounter daily.",399e0b45-1ac7-5866-858c-a31c6ab3f517,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/28/dining/28pour/28pour-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=ce0698329d28113782f40637ed54002d9c71491518880f4a18e556788e375295&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Matching the wine to the occasion is more important than the greatness of any one bottle.,399e0b45-1ac7-5866-858c-a31c6ab3f517,N24News/imgs/399e0b45-1ac7-5866-858c-a31c6ab3f517.jpg,17
Books,Eliminating Child Poverty With a Government Check,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/28/books/review/invisible-americans-jeff-madrick.html,"It's a paradox of American childhood poverty that experts routinely devise the most complex solutions for it -- or in recent parlance ""innovations"" -- most of which are elaborate, costly or otherwise impractical to implement.

Jeff Madrick is an exception to this rule. In his new book, ""Invisible Americans: The Tragic Cost of Child Poverty,"" he argues for a solution for children so simple that even a child could understand it: Give poor families money for their kids. In clear, spare prose, he lays out a proposal for something akin to a basic income guarantee for parents of children under 18. ""Poor children have many requirements, but above all they need money,"" he writes. He returns to this point repeatedly: ""Child poverty is too punishing and harmful to wait years for results -- especially when cash distributions can help today.""

Madrick's idea is essentially a subset of universal basic income, a concept championed by an increasing number of prominent Americans -- from the presidential candidate Andrew Yang to the conservative social scientist Charles Murray and the Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. Madrick, a veteran journalist and economic analyst, imagines a government-funded allowance to families that would equal $4,000 to $5,000 per child each year. Every family with children would get some money, which would avoid the problem of only offering the stipend to the guardians of poor youth. After all, there are millions of ""near poor"" and struggling middle-class families as well, trying to pay for their kids out of stagnant incomes. (According to current guidelines, a family of four living on $25,750 or less qualifies as poor; realistically, Madrick argues, the number should be closer to $50,000.) In addition, he would have the allowance ladled out according to a principle of ""non-paternalism""; in other words, it would be unconditional, like love.","In ""Invisible Americans,"" the veteran journalist Jeff Madrick lays out a simple solution to child poverty, a condition that affects 17.5 percent of this country's kids.",57a5e383-a34d-5d74-bd5b-e1f6f502d07f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/04/books/review/Quart1/Quart1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=962628bc327f7764807d843a2b4171dfc37cdfb030f499c3bd217f572828d0dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"In clear, spare prose, Jeff Madrick lays out a proposal for something akin to a basic income guarantee for parents of children under 18.",57a5e383-a34d-5d74-bd5b-e1f6f502d07f,N24News/imgs/57a5e383-a34d-5d74-bd5b-e1f6f502d07f.jpg,13

As exotic as they appear, these beings share a comforting familiarity: They are bilaterally symmetrical with, for the most part, a pair of eyes staring from a head connected by a neck to a torso equipped with matching pairs of limbs.

In their basic body plan they are little different from the motley crew in the public room of the Spouter-Inn where Ishmael meets Queequeg, Melville's illustrated man.

Media,Netflix Will Keep 'Friends' Through Next Year in a $100 Million Agreement,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/04/business/media/netflix-friends.html,"Are Netflix and ""Friends"" on a break? The answer is no -- for now. Reruns of Joey's thespian trials, Chandler's hapless sarcasm, Monica's compulsive cleanliness, Phoebe's feline riffs and the seemingly permanent courtship of Ross and Rachel will be available to watch on Netflix for at least another year, the streaming service has announced. But it will come at a steep price: The company will pay around $100 million to continue licensing the program from its owner, WarnerMedia, according to two people with direct knowledge of the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of the deal. That's a significant jump from the $30 million a year that Netflix had paid previously to stream the show. But the new amount reflects the thirst for content in the streaming age. Online viewing is the future of entertainment, and the industry's biggest players -- including WarnerMedia's parent, AT&T; the Walt Disney Company; Comcast's NBCUniversal; Viacom; CBS; and Discovery -- are retooling their streaming operations to take on services like Netflix and Amazon. For Netflix, paying big money for hit content is necessary to expanding its customer base, now 57 million in the United States and 130 million worldwide.

Questions about the show's future on the service began over the weekend when customers spotted a notice on Netflix's ""Friends"" page that read, ""Availability Until 1/1/19."" Some of the show's fans turned apoplectic. ""The only reason I have an account with Netflix is to rewatch Friends,"" Hayley Kiyoko posted on Twitter. ""Why @netflix are you hurting us."" The Netflix account responded: ""I would never hurt you, Hayley."" At an investor conference in New York on Monday, Ted Sarandos, head of Netflix's content division, said the show's departure ""is a rumor."" Later, the company officially announced the show would remain on the service. ""The Holiday Armadillo has granted your wish: 'Friends' will still be there for you in the US throughout 2019,"" Netflix posted in a tweet, which included an image of the character Ross in an armadillo suit from a scene in which he tries to explain the story of Hanukkah to his son. The deal to keep ""Friends"" on Netflix was due to expire by the end of the year, but both Netflix and AT&T had been negotiating for at least a few months to extend it, the people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Complicating the negotiation was AT&T's plan to begin a streaming service of its own by the end of 2019. AT&T acquired Time Warner in June for $85.4 billion, landing prized assets such as HBO, CNN and the Warner Bros. film and TV studios, which include shows like ""Friends"" and ""Big Bang Theory"" and blockbuster movies like ""Wonder Woman.""

""That's content we definitely want on our platform,"" AT&T's chief executive, Randall Stephenson, said of ""Friends"" at an investor conference on Tuesday. ""And clearly it's important to Netflix as well.""
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. He added that the new agreement between the two is nonexclusive, meaning ""Friends"" is likely to appear on AT&T's coming service by 2020. The sides are currently negotiating rates for after 2019 that would be significantly lower than $100 million, since the show would no longer stream exclusively on Netflix, the people with knowledge of the matter said. It's also possible that ""Friends"" could leave Netflix after next year, they added. To attract new streaming customers, AT&T will likely have to keep some of its shows and films off other services like Netflix and have them available only on AT&T's offering. Disney, which plans to debut its own streaming service by the end of next year, will start pulling some of its films from Netflix after next year. At AT&T's analyst conference last month, John Stankey, the executive put in charge of WarnerMedia, said streaming players like Netflix were ""going to see a pretty substantial structural shift"" in the availability of content over the next 18 to 24 months. Companies like Netflix ""should expect their libraries are going to get a lot thinner,"" he said. Streaming services have anticipated this for years. In order to differentiate one offering from another, Netflix, Hulu and Amazon have stressed the importance of exclusive content. Netflix, for example, has spent billions building up original shows, including hits like ""Stranger Things."" ""That's going to make it exciting for us,"" the Netflix chief executive, Reed Hastings, said on the company's earnings call in October of the forthcoming competition. ""It's great for consumers. Incredible for producers. I mean there's never been so much TV and movies being created around the world. So the game is on."" The market will support two or three on-demand streaming services, including Netflix, Mr. Stephenson said on Tuesday, ""and we want to be one of the two or three.""",The streaming service and AT&T struck an agreement that raises the yearly licensing fee for the show by more than three times.,143b3658-cd4f-5471-af0d-b5577cb103db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/05/business/05FRIENDS/05FRIENDS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=8bba9357504e60625c16b0954e5837fa14af3ec4320aaa91055556a70aa37a3e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Friends"" ended its 10-year run on NBC in 2004.

She grabbed Stephen Colbert by the hand and told him: ""I'm filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States -- tonight!"" Then she listed the reasons she's running. ""I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I would fight for my own -- which is why I believe that health care should be a right and not a privilege,"" she said. ""It's why I believe we should have better public schools for our kids, because it shouldn't matter what block you grow up on. And I believe that anybody who wants to work hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class.""

Colbert reminded Gillibrand that he had run presidential campaigns (as stunts, of course) in 2008 and 2012. ""I know how difficult it can be. I hope it goes better for you than it did for me,"" he joked. Then Colbert offered the senator a basket full of charms and souvenirs, including a plane ticket to Michigan -- a sidelong swipe at Hillary Clinton, who neglected to campaign in that state in 2016 and famously lost it to Trump.

Jimmy Fallon taped Tuesday's ""Tonight Show"" in Puerto Rico, and things got going with a bang. During the opening sequence, Fallon joined Lin-Manuel Miranda and the cast of ""Hamilton"" in the theater in San Juan where they're currently performing the musical. Then, along with Questlove and Black Thought of the Roots, he wandered into downtown San Juan, where he met up with the singer Bad Bunny. An impromptu dance party started. Later in the show, Fallon interviewed Miranda about his decision to bring ""Hamilton"" to Puerto Rico, where the playwright and actor's father is from. Miranda talked about the resonances between the subject matter in ""Hamilton"" and the experiences of Puerto Ricans. ""There's a song in this show called 'Hurricane,' and I could barely get through it last night, because it is about that,"" he said. ""What I remember from Hurricane Maria so vividly was the quiet -- was, like, literally not being able to hear from the island in that sort of immediate aftermath. And the opening line to that song is, 'In the eye of a hurricane, there's quiet.' So it sort of brought all that back."" He said he hadn't imagined ""it would resonate in this particular way.""

Representative Steve King -- who has a long history of making racist remarks -- was stripped of his committee posts this week by congressional Republican leaders after saying in an interview with The New York Times that he wasn't sure why terms like ""white supremacist"" and ""white nationalist"" were considered offensive. He's been derided by politicians on both sides of the aisle, and some Republicans have called for him to resign. One person who has not weighed in is Trump, who told reporters that he had not been following the story. Hearing this, Trevor Noah feigned astonishment. ""You haven't been following it? What else are you doing? [impersonating Trump] 'I'm extremely busy, folks. You think a name like ""Jeff Bozo"" just comes out of nowhere, huh? Genius like that takes time!'"" -- TREVOR NOAH, referring to Trump's new epithet for Jeff Bezos ""In an interview with The New York Times, Steve King basically said that he doesn't think there's anything wrong with being a white supremacist. Now, that feels like a pretty racist thing to say -- which makes it even more surprising that Trump isn't following this. I mean, you'd think an algorithm would have recommended it by now. It'd be like, 'If you like Charlottesville, you'll love Steve King!'"" -- TREVOR NOAH After critiquing Trump, Noah aired a noir-style skit in which he donned a detective's outfit and tried to sleuth out whether King is, in fact, a racist. Seth Meyers decided to examine how Trump's policies were affecting the rural voters who helped elect him.","""Normally I would wonder if you didn't know how to spell it or if you just made a typo,"" Seth Meyers said.

Opinion,Choose a Gift That Changes Lives,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/21/opinion/sunday/charitable-holiday-gift-guide.html,"This will be a painful holiday season in many households, with fewer people hugging and handing out gifts. But if you're feeling that the holidays have been ""canceled"" and you're struggling to find hope and meaning this season, have I got some uplifting ideas for you! Every year at this time I offer a holiday guide suggesting ""gifts with meaning"" rather than one more scarf or tie that will sit in the bottom of a drawer. This year I recommend three inspiring organizations that can help you transform a life -- and I bet your Aunt Mabel would prefer such a gift in her name to more perfume. A reader has pledged $1 million so that for each of 10 years, my top charity in this guide will receive $100,000. Two other readers are providing $50,000 again this year to be split between the two runners-up. And other readers will surely contribute much more (you donated $3 million last year). You can easily make donations through the Kristof Holiday Impact Prize website, and here's what they will accomplish: Educate a girl. My grand prize winner is Camfed (originally called the Campaign for Female Education), which helps girls in African countries get an education. One of the world's best bargains is the chance to help a girl go to school in a country like Ghana, Malawi or Zimbabwe: A year in high school costs $150, elementary school about $30.

To understand the transformative power of education, consider a brilliant Zimbabwean girl named Angeline. Other students laughed at Angeline for attending school barefoot and wearing a torn dress with nothing underneath. Officials shouted her name at school assemblies when her family was behind in paying school fees. ""It was an epic humiliation,"" she remembers. But what Angeline lacked in resources and wardrobe, she made up for in brain power: In the seventh-grade nationwide exams, hers was No. 1 in her district, and she had one of the best scores in the entire country. Yet still she couldn't afford high school -- until Camfed gave her a scholarship, and then Angeline performed brilliantly. Today, Angeline Murimirwa, 40, is executive director of Camfed's programs in Africa, helping 123,000 girls a year get an education. I've followed Camfed for more than a dozen years, and one reason I chose it as my grand prize winner is that it's close to a perpetual motion machine. Some 157,000 Camfed graduates pay it forward by mentoring girls and paying their fees (each graduate financially supports five students on average, not counting those in her own household). Camfed alumnae actually support more students than Camfed itself, a virtuous cycle that grows over time. Supporting education is particularly important this year because the coronavirus pandemic is leading millions of girls to drop out of school, and the United Nations estimates that the pandemic may push 13 million girls into child marriages. Who wouldn't rather give a girl an education than put one more present under a tree?

Send a young person to college. Another prize winner is OneGoal, which mentors low-income students in the United States, helping them graduate from high school and succeed in college. OneGoal ensures that Black lives matter: 96 percent of participants are students of color, and it provides a bridge for them to complete high school and get a solid start in college. OneGoal supports 12,500 students, and 99 percent of them graduate from high school and 86 percent go on to college. Because first-generation college students sometimes flounder in their first year and leave without a degree, OneGoal supports them through that critical first year. Melissa Connelly, 37, the organization's chief executive, exemplifies the challenges some students face and how much difference a helping hand can make. One of six children in a dysfunctional home with a mom struggling with addiction, Melissa routinely skipped school and often ran away from home or was kicked out; she spent much of high school homeless. As a Black girl earning D's in school, she was pegged as hopeless and put in a truancy class -- a babysitting program for problem kids until they dropped out. ""I was that kid who was written off as a lost cause,"" she remembers. But Melissa's white boyfriend was in Advanced Placement classes, and she protested the difference in education they were getting in the same school. She also had a superb social worker who guided her, and Melissa was able to talk her way into A.P. classes -- and from then on earned straight A's. It took five years of attending four colleges, juggling tuition bills the whole way, to earn a B.A. She then earned two graduate degrees. Mentoring programs like OneGoal are particularly important now because remote learning has been a catastrophe for children in chaotic homes without internet access. McKinsey & Company has warned that an additional one million kids may drop out of school during this pandemic. OneGoal is working hard to keep these kids on track, and it costs only about $1,600 to add a student to OneGoal for a year.

Restore a person's sight. My final prize winner is the Himalayan Cataract Project, also known as Cure Blindness, which fights blindness in Asia and Africa. This, too, is a bargain: The surgery can cost as little as $25 per person, or $50 for both eyes. The Himalayan Cataract Project was founded by Dr. Sanduk Ruit, a Nepali ophthalmologist who helped develop a cataract microsurgery technique (the ""Nepal method""), and Dr. Geoff Tabin of Stanford University Medical School. I traveled to the remote town of Hetauda, Nepal, to watch the doctors perform the surgeries -- and I've rarely seen anything so exhilarating. After years of blindness, a 50-year-old woman, Thuli Maya Thing, was among those lined up for the operation. ""I can't fetch firewood or water,"" she told me. ""I fall down many times. I've been burned by the fire."" A day after the surgery, I watched as her bandages were removed. She stood blinking, and then smiled giddily as she saw her surroundings for the first time in years. Doctors tested her vision and found it to be 20/20. ""I used to get around by crawling,"" she said, ""and now I can get up and walk.""

Focusing Philanthropy will also pay for the credit card transaction costs of your donation, so that 100 cents on the dollar will go to your designated charity. Of course, this year many people are financially constrained, so I'm also recommending two options for those who would prefer to volunteer their time. One is Reading Partners, which deploys adult volunteers who coach disadvantaged children in reading (during the pandemic, this is typically done by Zoom). More than 90 percent of Reading Partners children are kids of color, nearly all qualifying for free or reduced-price lunches. Only 22 percent of third graders nationwide who receive free or reduced-price lunches read at grade level, but tutoring makes a huge difference. About three-quarters of third and fourth graders in Reading Partners are able to close the gap with their peers. Reading is one of the most important tools a child needs, in school and in life, and a volunteer can provide that gift. My other volunteer recommendation is Court Appointed Special Advocates, or CASA, which supports foster youth in nearly every county in the country. I recommend CASA because America's foster care system is broken, and our 400,000 foster kids need help. Only 58 percent of foster kids graduate from high school by age 19, and one-fifth are homeless within a year and a half of turning 18 and aging out of the system. By the age of 26, a majority of these young women and men have been arrested.

We can't fix foster care overnight, but we can help these neglected kids negotiate a sometimes uncaring system -- and that's what CASA does. Volunteers provide support and advocacy for children who sometimes have no one else to trust, while helping them navigate the bureaucracy. You can volunteer for Reading Partners or CASA through the same website, KristofImpact.org. When I began these giving guides in 2009, they raised eyebrows. My colleagues and I wondered: Is it appropriate for a journalist to make such recommendations? Yet the suggestions filled a need. Many readers would like to be more generous but don't know who to give to, while great nonprofits are desperate for support to change lives. So I'm again playing matchmaker, at a time when the pandemic makes the needs more urgent. I hope you find that the chance to help others brings you some holiday cheer.

Media,New Way to Pay Songwriters and Musicians in the Streaming Age Advances,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/28/business/media/music-copyright-digital-services.html,"From left, songwriters Kay Hanley and Michelle Lewis, with Dina LaPolt, a music industry lawyer who said the Music Modernization Act ""is going to revolutionize the way songwriters get paid in America.""

New Way to Pay Songwriters and Musicians in the Streaming Age Advances

For a decade, the music industry has promoted a motley series of copyright bills to Congress, only to watch them fail. In an effort to update music copyright law for the digital age, the various players involved -- tech companies, music publishers, songwriters, musicians and radio broadcasters -- assembled an ambitious bill that addressed their concerns. On Thursday, in a sign that their work is paying off, the Senate Judiciary Committee discussed the matter in some detail and voted in favor of the bill, the Music Modernization Act. ""This is going to revolutionize the way songwriters get paid in America,"" said Dina LaPolt, a lawyer who has been one of the music industry's most aggressive supporters of the bill.

The bill is meant to correct the flaws and loopholes that have led musicians to complain about unfair compensation from streaming services, while also protecting companies like Spotify from lawsuits. It also establishes a truce between music publishers and digital music services over an aspect of licensing that has led to a string of multimillion-dollar lawsuits. For years, songwriters and music publishers have argued that streaming services have routinely failed to properly acquire mechanical licenses -- the permission to reproduce a piece of music for sale or consumption, a term that goes back to the days of player pianos. At the same time, Spotify and other companies said that there was no authoritative database identifying who owned what. David Israelite, the president of the National Music Publishers' Association and one of the main drivers behind the bill, said that the prospect of continuing litigation brought the tech companies to the table. ""I have no doubt that we could have sued them out of existence,"" Mr. Israelite said of streaming services. ""But we took a different approach. We decided that we wanted to settle this and try to fix the problem, because we want them to be our business partners."" Lobbyists said they were confident the bill would be passed by the full Senate, and eventually become law, despite concerns raised by a few senators at the hearing. A version of the bill passed the House unanimously in April.

The legislation would establish a licensing collective, to be overseen by songwriters and publishers, and paid for by the digital services, with rights information maintained by the copyright owners. Digital services, which now must track down rights holders or file notices in bulk with the Copyright Office, will be able to receive blanket licenses from the collective. In exchange, the services will gain protections against lawsuits. In a lawsuit filed late last year, for example -- just before a cutoff date set by the bill -- a music publisher representing songs by Tom Petty, Stevie Nicks and others sued Spotify for $1.6 billion over licensing lapses. Under the Music Modernization Act, the licensing collective would serve as a one-stop shop to obtain those rights.

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Some Republicans on the Judiciary Committee, including the Texas senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, expressed reservations on Thursday about a collective established by the government rather than the free market, but still voted in favor of the bill. Christopher Harrison, the chief executive of the Digital Media Association, a group that includes Google, Apple and Amazon, said that the new process would remove the bad faith that has existed between music publishers and streaming services. ""I describe those conversations as like the end of a Tarantino movie, where everybody is pointing guns at each other and claiming it's the other person's fault,"" Mr. Harrison said. ""We had a number of really frank conversations with publishers, saying, 'Let's get past who is to blame and figure out how to solve the problem.'"" A critical element of the bill would allow musicians to be paid for digital plays of recordings made before 1972, which are not covered by federal copyright. At a Senate hearing last month, Smokey Robinson called that rule unfair. ""An arbitrary date on the calendar,"" he said, ""should not be the arbiter of value."" The bill also includes two provisions favored by Ascap and BMI, the industry's two biggest royalty clearinghouses, over the complex procedures used to set royalty rates in federal courts.

Both groups, which are governed by federal regulations, would be able to introduce new kinds of evidence in court. Those trials are now overseen by a pair of federal judges whose decisions are endlessly scrutinized for clues about future cases; under the Music Modernization Act, the cases would be randomly assigned to a pool of judges in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, which the bill's backers argue would make the process more fair. The Music Modernization Act combines parts of several proposals made over the last year. But some parts of the legislation have been proposed before in separate bills, most of which collapsed from disputes among warring factions of the music industry. ""Congress was getting tired of us coming to them with narrow fixes,"" said Daryl Friedman, the chief advocacy officer of the Recording Academy, the organization behind the Grammy Awards. Although lobbyists agreed on a compromise bill that has broad support, one long-sought change to copyright law -- the ability for performers and record companies to be paid when songs are played on terrestrial radio, in addition to songwriters -- was sacrificed to gain support from broadcasters, who for decades have bitterly opposed such a change. The bill does have its detractors, including publishers that did not want to relinquish the right to sue digital services. Christian Castle, a lawyer and blogger who is often critical of Silicon Valley, said the bill also does not adequately provide for the costs of setting up a comprehensive rights database. ""It is a phenomenally huge undertaking which has befuddled everybody,"" Mr. Castle said, ""and there is no process for it."" A report by the Congressional Budget Office in April, prepared for the House version of the bill, estimated the cost of establishing the licensing collective at $47 million.","A Senate committee voted in favor of the Music Modernization Act, moving it one step closer to becoming law. It aims to modernize the analog-era music copyright law.",0e61e709-ce73-5056-841c-e2b2c467a292,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/29/business/29MUSICBILL02/29MUSICBILL02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e42f39b51fc3ef9201f6386951a675debd5fbbdec5f8985d8de0f05fe614a365&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, songwriters Kay Hanley and Michelle Lewis, with Dina LaPolt, a music industry lawyer who said the Music Modernization Act &ldquo;is going to revolutionize the way songwriters get paid in America.&rdquo;",0e61e709-ce73-5056-841c-e2b2c467a292,N24News/imgs/0e61e709-ce73-5056-841c-e2b2c467a292.jpg,16
Economy,"E.C.B. Shifts Guidance, as Europe Moves Toward Normalcy",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/07/business/economy/ecb-euro-italy.html,"FRANKFURT -- Political instability in a heavily indebted eurozone country. The prospect of a trade war with the United States. Stock market turmoil. None of it fazed the European Central Bank, which took another small step back from crisis mode on Thursday. The bank's policymakers, who set monetary policy for the 19-nation euro area, held interest rates steady, but dropped language from their communique in which they had promised to ramp up economic stimulus measures again ""if the outlook becomes less favorable."" It was a subtle but important change. By omitting the phrase, which it has repeated since December 2016, the central bank was in effect saying that the eurozone was no longer in imminent danger of going up in flames, and that it was time to begin stowing the fire hoses.

The expression of confidence came despite warnings from Mario Draghi, the central bank's president, about trade tensions with the United States. Mr. Draghi, in an obvious reference to President Trump's plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, said during a news conference that it was ""dangerous"" for countries to change the terms of trade unilaterally, rather than through negotiations. The protectionist measures were part of a general diplomatic deterioration, Mr. Draghi added, and could damage the confidence that businesses needed before they would invest in expansion and hiring. ""If you put tariffs against your allies,"" Mr. Draghi said, ""one wonders who the enemies are."" It was the second news conference in a row in which Mr. Draghi had expressed exasperation with the Trump administration. In January, he accused Steven Mnuchin, the U.S. treasury secretary, of violating international agreements by making comments that caused the dollar to fall against the euro, giving American products a price advantage in foreign markets. Still, the European Central Bank's Governing Council was not alarmed enough by the potential trade war to interrupt its gradual exit from the emergency measures it has used to keep the eurozone from falling apart during a decade of financial and economic turmoil.

While Thursday's communique merely omitted a single sentence, and Mr. Draghi sought to downplay the importance of the change, investors appeared to find it significant.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Markets reacted swiftly, with the euro jumping as much as 0.5 percent against the dollar, and the yield on the German 10-year bond, the benchmark for the region, rising five basis points. ""It's a tacit acknowledgment that the economic outlook in Europe is rosier than it was,"" James Athey, a senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments, said in a statement. He added, ""The reaction should not be overdone. This is an infinitesimal step forwards."" Some analysts had predicted that the central bank would make no changes in the language it uses to communicate its intentions to financial markets, in light of a confused election result in Italy. On Sunday about half of Italians voted for populist candidates on the left and right, and left no party with a clear mandate to form a government. There is now very little chance that the country will make the sweeping changes needed to break its economy out of prolonged stagnation. Its political deadlock and economic doldrums are a threat to the rest of the common currency area. Italy's government debt, measured as a percentage of economic output, is among the highest in the world and, in Europe, second only to Greece's. But Italy also has the eurozone's third-largest economy, with output 10 times that of Greece, making it a far bigger danger to the region's financial stability if investors begin to doubt the government's solvency.

""We have to bury the hope that Italy will catch up with Germany and France with reforms,"" Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Berenberg, a German bank, said over lunch with reporters in Frankfurt on Tuesday. ""Italy will more likely worsen its ability to carry its debt."" The European Central Bank was also unfazed by the ups and downs of global stock markets since the Governing Council last met on monetary policy. Mr. Draghi pointed out that the market turmoil was centered on the United States and ""it was pretty short."" As expected, the Governing Council opted on Thursday to leave monetary policy unchanged. Interest rates will remain at a record low level. There is a faction on the Governing Council that is worried that inflation, now dormant, could get out of hand if the central bank waits too long to stop its purchases of government and corporate bonds, a form of money printing intended to stimulate the economy. That faction has been in the minority, but appeared to win the upper hand on Thursday.","The European Central Bank made a subtle but important change in a statement, taking a step toward exiting crisis mode in its monetary policy.",f8e8cd3f-1316-5791-a60f-bbc891468c17,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/09/business/09ECB/09ECB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=72b9359fb4cccc254369b9e1f57da5cf3dec95ee86305fd2f9d538c48d758ee2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank.

Science,Elephants Really Can't Hold Their Liquor,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/20/science/drunk-elephants-genes.html,"Humans are not the only animals that get drunk. Birds that gorge on fermented berries and sap are known to fall out of trees and crash into windows. Elk that overdo it with rotting apples get stuck in trees. Moose wasted on overripe crab apples get tangled in swing sets, hammocks and even Christmas lights.

Elephants, though, are the animal kingdom's most well-known boozers. One scientific paper describes elephant trainers rewarding animals with beer and other alcoholic beverages, with one elephant in the 18th century said to have drunk 30 bottles of port a day. In 1974, a herd of 150 elephants in West Bengal, India, became intoxicated after breaking into a brewery, then went on a rampage that destroyed buildings and killed five people.

Despite these widespread reports, scientists have questioned whether animals -- especially large ones such as elephants and elk -- actually become inebriated. In 2006, researchers calculated that based on the amount of alcohol it takes to get a human drunk, a 6,600-pound elephant on a bender would have to quickly consume up to 27 liters of seven percent ethanol, the key ingredient in alcohol. Such a quantity of booze is unlikely to be obtained in the wild. Intoxicated wild elephants, the researchers concluded, must be a myth. As the lead author said at the time, ""People just want to believe in drunken elephants.""

If you are one who wanted to believe, a study published in April in Biology Letters might serve as your vindication. A team of scientists say that the earlier myth-busting researchers made a common mistake: They assumed that elephants would have to consume as much alcohol to get drunk as humans do. In fact, elephants are likely exceptional lightweights because they -- and many other mammals -- lack a key enzyme that quickly metabolizes ethanol. The findings highlight the need to consider species on an individual basis.","Humans and other species have a gene mutation that lets them digest alcohol. In other species, it's missing.",2b4025a4-5ff6-5850-85f2-5ec3ca95967c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/26/science/20TB-DRUNKELEPHANTS1/20SCI-DRUNKELEPHANTS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=51be72efd3241e9182676c8b24c5acb663b2c69fff480b83570ffe18b6f950b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Look at these lightweights at the Elephant Conservation Center in Laos.,2b4025a4-5ff6-5850-85f2-5ec3ca95967c,N24News/imgs/2b4025a4-5ff6-5850-85f2-5ec3ca95967c.jpg,2
Travel,Airport Hotels Go Glam,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/travel/airport-hotels-go-glam.html,"In recent years, several properties have opened at airports around the globe with attractive amenities, sleek design and tasty food. They're welcoming hotels for travelers to spend a night or even a multiday layover.

""The old stereotype used to be that airport hotels were dumpy or staid,"" said Reneta McCarthy, a senior lecturer at the School of Hotel Administration at Cornell University. ""That's no longer the case, and you see many more interesting and vibrant properties, most notably from companies who want to reinvigorate their brands.""

An artistic experience close enough for a layover

Ms. McCarthy recently stayed at The Westin Denver International Airport, one such hotel. ""It was such a happening spot with an airy lobby and had a unique design sensibility,"" she said. ""I would definitely go back and recommend it to others.""

The hotel is in a building designed by the architecture firm Gensler and is LEED platinum certified. Its design is meant to resemble the wings of a bird; the building has a curved shape that swoops down in the middle, revealing views of the adjacent terminal, while the glass curtain walls reflect the sky. The Westin commissioned three artists to create the large-scale works in and around the property. One of them is Patrick Marold, a local artist, whose sculpture ""Shadow Array,"" is made with 236 beetle-kill spruce logs from Southern Colorado and is situated outside.","Airport hotels don't have to be purely functional and only places to sleep before or after a long flight.

Travel,Want to Relax in a Nice Hotel for 15 Minutes? An App Can Make That Happen,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/travel/app-luxury-hotel-rooms-by-the-minute.html,"Why pay for an overnight hotel stay when you need a room during the day for only a few hours or even just a few minutes? It's an idea that is likely to appeal to many consumers, according to a handful of companies that sell hotel rooms for short blocks of time. By-the-hour hotel rooms aren't a novel concept. In fact, they have a reputation for being used for illicit reasons, said Sean Hennessy, a hotel consultant and an assistant professor of hospitality at the Jonathan M. Tisch Center for Hospitality and Tourism at New York University. But while these brief rentals are traditionally found at budget hotels, the enterprises today involve higher-end properties and are targeting middle-class to affluent customers for considerably different purposes. ""Now, more than ever before, the hotel industry is focused on trying to generate as much revenue as possible, and taking advantage of empty rooms during the day is one way to do that,"" Mr. Hennessy said. The guests who might book these rooms, he said, include travelers with layovers, corporate travelers who need a quiet place to work and don't have an office in town, and locals who are seeking some downtime during the day and find it more convenient to check into a hotel near where they are rather than go back home.

Mr. Hennessy said that it can often be too logistically challenging for hotels to try sell rooms for small pockets of time on their own, and instead, a growing number of properties are collaborating with companies that can help them. One example is HotelsbyDay.com, with a presence in more than 60 cities in the United States, including New York City, Chicago and Denver, as well as in London and Paris. The brand works with more than 600 hotels in the three- to five-star categories, and rooms are available to book for a minimum of four hours between 9 a.m. and 7 p.m. Pricing varies by destination, but the chief executive officer, Yannis Moati, said that the national average is $90 for four hours. Dayuse.com, available for 4,000 hotels in 22 countries, also partners with three- to five-star properties, with a three-hour minimum on reservations. And now, with the app Recharge, users can book rooms by the minute at luxury properties in New York City and San Francisco. Intrigued by the idea, I used Recharge to book stays at three hotels in New York City, where I live. My visits were all under a half-hour, and over the course of a weekend, I got the feel of what it was like to be a by-the-minute hotel guest.

Recharge launched in San Francisco in 2016 and last April in New York City and can be used to book rooms by the minute in about 20 hotels in each destination, at any time of day or night. Many are five-star properties, such as the Surrey and the Pierre in New York City and the Taj Campton Palace in San Francisco, and some are in the four-star category. In 2018, the service will expand to Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami and Washington, D.C. The company's co-founder and chief executive officer, Manny Bamfo, said that he started Recharge because he believed that there was a demand for hotel stays in minute-long increments. These stays can be booked for immediate visits or for ones up to a day in advance, but booking is only through the app. Recharge's customers -- more than 30,000 as of November -- are mostly locals and include mothers who want a clean place to nurse their babies or pump their breast milk, people seeking a quiet space to take a phone call and those seeking a midday reprieve. ""We've even had fathers who need to change their child's diaper and would rather do it in a hotel room than in a coffee shop bathroom,"" Mr. Bamfo said. ""You pay for the amount of time you need and nothing more."" Hotels benefit, too, Mr. Bamfo said: According to the company's research, a 250-room property can get almost 275-rooms' worth of revenue in one day from these short stays. Every hotel listed on Recharge's app has a service fee, ranging from $30 to $50. The more luxurious the hotel, the higher the fee. After the service fee, per minute prices for the stays range from 50 cents to $2. Pricing for the same property can fluctuate throughout the day, depending on supply and demand, and some hotels may have a minimum charge at certain times of the day. I tried Recharge on a weekend when I had to hit different neighborhoods in Manhattan for various errands.

My first trial was on a Saturday afternoon after I unexpectedly spent two hours at the Apple store on Fifth Avenue in Midtown, getting my iPhone fixed. There was just an hour before my dinner reservation on the West Side, and going back to my East Side apartment only to leave again almost immediately for the meal seemed like a waste of time. Here was my opportunity to turn to Recharge. The app showed availability in a dozen hotels, including the Pierre, just a few blocks away. I reserved my room, showed up five minutes later and was warmly greeted at the front desk by an employee, who had a record of my booking and offered me a bottle of water. Although my room overlooked a wall, it was well-appointed with silk fabrics, wood furniture and a white marble bath stocked with toiletries from the luxury brand Etro. I relaxed on the bed, weary from my long wait at Apple, and after channel-flipping for 15 minutes, I was somewhat revived and ready to enjoy my night out. Checking out, which involved clicking one button on the app, couldn't have been easier, and once I did, I got an email receipt for my $69.95 stay. The next day, between returning clothes at multiple stores, buying baby gifts and restocking my spices with a trip to Kalustyan's in the Curry Hill neighborhood, I checked into two hotels when I needed a break. The first one was Fifty NYC, an Affinia hotel , in Midtown East. Recharge listed the property in the four-star category, and it was indeed less lavish than the Pierre, although the service was just as warm. My room's simple decor didn't bother me, but the lack of light did: on a bright, sunny day, my view of a wall made it feel like it was dark outside. I caught up on emails during my 14-minute, $45.03 stay, and although it was time well-spent, more natural light would have made that time more pleasant. Would I fare better at the Michelangelo, on the West Side? No, as it turned out. The property, with gleaming marble floors and gilded elevators, was opulent, and my room was spacious, but it was the darkest of the three. I spent $61.05 for my 20 minutes there, which I used to call my mother-in-law in India, and truthfully, I couldn't have stayed much more -- the ambience was too gloomy. Mr. Bamfo said that my rooms were not reflective of the typical Recharge experience. ""Hotels put our customers in any available rooms, even if they're not in the entry-level category,"" he said. ""It's unusual that you would be in a string of dark rooms."" Recharge is easy to use and has an appealing list of hotels. In a market in which companies sell stays at properties for small chunks of time, the brand's by-the-minute feature helps it stand out. I can't necessarily justify paying to use it on a regular basis, but I can see why some people would. When you need a place to put your feet up or are seeking privacy for another reason, checking into a fancy hotel room for as little as a few minutes may be just the thing.",Recharge lets you rent a room by the minute at luxury properties.

Automobiles,Mercedes-Benz Simulator Shows Off Safety Technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/22/automobiles/mercedes-benz-simulator-shows-off-safety-technology.html,"MONTVALE, N.J. -- There is little doubt that Mercedes-Benz is has advanced safety technology, and the automaker prides itself on its ability to offer semiautonomous safety features even on its entry-level models. To show off its electronic safety measures, Mercedes-Benz USA set up an ""Intelligent Drive"" simulator here at its corporate headquarters. The setup consisted of a silver S-Class sedan with huge video monitors on three sides. A bank of computers in the trunk controlled the monitors and a series of actuators under the car, as well as three smaller monitors for the rearview mirror positions. Surprisingly lifelike, the simulator succeeded in making the back-seat passengers a little queasy. The point, of course, was to illustrate how Mercedes's semiautonomous safety systems worked. The cars still require driver input - if you take your hands off the wheel, the system complains with a warning light and an alarm - but new technology makes it easier to recover from moments of inattention without encountering disaster. In real life, cameras and radar sensors can see objects around the car and determine whether they're moving or stationary. The signals collected by the cameras and sensors then tell the car's computer what needs to happen to keep the car's occupants safe: For instance, if the brakes or steering need to be applied, if the lights should be adjusted or if the driver needs a reminder to pay attention to the road.

A pair of safety engineers - Matthias Struck and Andreas Gottschol - demonstrated the simulator, which they said was a toned-down version of a fully automated - and, because it includes a movable platform, much less portable - simulator the automaker had for testing at its world headquarters in Stuttgart, Germany. The screens displayed a German landscape that, although it appeared something like a video game, was realistic enough to convey the motion of driving; think Grand Theft Auto, but not as fancy. There were other cars on the road - Volkswagens, Audis and, of course, other Benzes - and drivers in the left lane actually got out of the way when faster traffic approached from behind. Here are some of the systems Mercedes had for journalists to test on the light edition of its simulator: # Distronic Plus with Steering Assist: This adaptive cruise-control system adjusts speed as traffic conditions change, leaving adequate space between your vehicle and the one ahead. The actual distance depends on speed and can also be adjusted by the driver to something that is far enough away to instill a feeling of safety in the driver, yet close enough to keep interlopers from cutting in during heavy traffic. Sensors in the front bumpers ""read"" lane markings and help the driver stay on course. In the simulator, the cruise speed was set at about 60 miles per hour on a limited-access highway setting. The system maintained the car's following distance when vehicles ahead slowed or stopped, but when I removed my hands from the steering wheel and laid them at my sides, the computer expressed its displeasure by emitting a warning tone and lights. Mr. Gottschol said the top cruise speed was about 124 m.p.h. # Active Lane Keeping with Blind Spot Assist: Working a bit differently than the adaptive cruise-steering function, this system nudges the vehicle back into its lane if the driver allows it to meander. Sensors in the front and rear of the vehicle also allow it to sense when there is another vehicle in the blind spot.

In the simulated setting of a limited-access highway, the program demonstrated what it felt like when the car corrected its position with a slight pull of the brakes on one side. It was easy to imagine that this feature would help drowsy drivers. # Collision Prevention Assist: When the car was moving quickly, this system activated alarms and the brakes to prevent collisions. But it did not stop the car completely. I found out the hard way that if the driver activates the brakes first, the system steps aside and lets the driver have full control. It was a good example of how this technology is not fully autonomous, still deferring to human input. # Pre-Safe Braking with Pedestrian Detection: Driving along a narrow lane in a town-driving simulation, Mr. Gottschol instructed me to act as if I didn't see the pedestrian stepping into the street in front of a virtual Starbucks. The system did its job, and the simulator car stopped short with a mechanical lurch. The engineers said that in real life, Pre-Safe will stop the car completely at speeds up to 31 m.p.h. They also pointed out that in an actual car the lurch would be much more intense than the computer- and actuator-generated one. # Adaptive Highbeam Assist: Mercedes' intelligent lights are an attractive feature. Because they're tied in with the car's sensors and cameras, you can leave them on the bright setting all night if you wish. As you approach a car from the rear, the system detects where the car is and carves out a shadow in the beam, so the driver ahead isn't blinded by bright light in his mirror. The system also switches to low beams as oncoming traffic approaches and detects pedestrians and animals (yes, it knows the difference and tells you) along the side of the road. # Pre-Safe Plus Rear End Collision Protection: The car's rear sensors detect impending rear-end collisions, tightening the seatbelts and applying the brakes to minimize the impact on occupants. There is also an Attention Assist feature that helps fatigued drivers from getting into trouble. It works by analyzing your driving habits and looking for signs that you may be losing alertness, particularly after you've been in the saddle for more than two and a half hours. All of these systems worked great, particularly during tame, responsible driving. But because a simulator operator can drive irresponsibly with impunity, Mercedes's engineers indulged me in some spirited driving around a virtual parking lot. I was instructed to reverse at full speed and cut the wheel, throwing the car into Drive as soon as the nose whipped around. For the most part, the maneuver worked, with the simulator adding authenticity to the spinning video screen with a little body roll and the sound of screeching tires. After a few of those and a series of Nascar-style doughnuts on the virtual grass, the back-seat passenger reported feeling markedly more dizzy.","Outfitted with sensors, cameras and computers, Mercedes-Benz vehicles are able to avoid hazards.",8e7de73a-6f7c-55a5-a068-45c0bd42486c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/21/automobiles/21SIMULATOR-image1/21SIMULATOR-image1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=315&w=600&s=8cbf72263a7af852d0b2233be395815d0a65c51f20a810c84175f7d8cae4402f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Using a combination of cameras and sensors, Mercedes-Benz has been able to program cars to avoid road hazards.",8e7de73a-6f7c-55a5-a068-45c0bd42486c,N24News/imgs/8e7de73a-6f7c-55a5-a068-45c0bd42486c.jpg,23
Style,Art Is Fashion Is Art Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/13/style/token-canal-street.html,"I've been to Token maybe a half dozen times in the last few months. It's a modest store, jammed in between a tattoo shop and a smoke shop, in a neighborhood that you just ... find yourself in. Dimes, Scarr's, Metrograph, Kiki's. Not quite a neighborhood in the Jane Jacobs sense, but the sort of area that New York breeds and then snuffs out. Small cafes, stores with modern shelving, a destination restaurant or two. One of two things will happen. The vacant storefronts will fill up, rents will skyrocket, the current inhabitants will get forced out; or a plateau followed by an ebb, these few blocks slowly withering back to tumbleweed territory.

For either outcome, Token may be a durable fit. It doesn't ask for much. It is not a whole lot to look at: some T-shirts (O.K., a lot of T-shirts), a smattering of other clothing, some art and photography books, a rack of surfboards. (Token, the brand, is a surf line.)

But what Token lacks in product mix it makes up for in ideology. We're in a moment in which the lines between art and fashion -- or, I should say, the people who make art and the people who make fashion -- is blurrier than ever. People dabble in both, often with little distinction between the two. That is the new normal: A T-shirt is a zine is a cap is an album is a painting. The medium matters far less than the intent with which the art was made. Some of the most intriguing items at Token are from artists who dabble in clothing, like Joe Garvey, whose T-shirt designs are sneakily elegiac ($40 to $45) and which I happily snapped up. There are shirts and zines from the outlaw-focused publisher Paper Work, and collaborations with the artist Peter Sutherland and the young curators Katja Horvat and Paige Silveria ($60). And there is a thoughtful collection of books and zines for sale as well. I particularly enjoyed Rafael Rios's disarmingly intimate ""Family"" and ""Dog Dance,"" a collection of Brad Elterman's behind-the-scenes pics of late '70s-early '80s Los Angeles excess. Also Dizzy, an art magazine and one of my favorite new periodicals of the last couple of years.

Token is part of a passel of worthwhile stores in the area. Patricia Field's ARTFashion takes the line-blurring remit a little more seriously, stocking artist-made clothes that have been assaulted by paint. Elkel carries men's clothing with sharp ideological corners. The Hunt is a curio shop set up in an old appliance storefront. And Coming Soon is a smart -- and very pastel -- modern design and furniture shop. A couple of storefronts down from Token is Labor, the not-very-breathable skate shop. (I have not been in the Alexander Olch store across the street because I have not yet been cast in a Whit Stillman film.) That there are so many books and magazines at Token makes sense, because despite the store's small footprint, it has a kind of magnetism that draws people in and encourages them to stay. I am not alone in that. Every time I've been there, people are lingering. Some were friends of the clerk or the store, some were just customers. But almost everyone found a reason to dawdle.

The last time I visited, a very chill and patient sales clerk fielded a seemingly endless barrage of passers-by. When I walked in, he was planning a skate hang with a friend. Before long, he was pulled away by an older gentleman with a film-director look who was surveying the store's collection of surfboards because he needed one before the next day. Next, the sales clerk patiently tolerated -- or perhaps politely tuned out -- a noob who was trying on a work jacket with high-visibility panels by UPWW, the high-end work wear line, and loudly remarking how it might allow him to walk into a construction site, but also go to a bar, while his friend mused out loud about looking to find the same garment online. As it happens, on this day, Token was hosting a quasi art show. No, that set-piece performance of the blunders of cross-cultural understanding wasn't it. Rather, there were some Cali Thornhill DeWitt posters, a surfboard designed in collaboration with the British graffiti brand Gasius, some rowdy Neckface books. Part of the store was essentially shrouded in a canvas tent, with videos projected onto the fabric. I got to talking with the clerk about art and fashion. Some artists, he said, didn't, or couldn't, see themselves working in an accessible space like this. But what gives Token its quiet energy is that so many of them do, embracing a notion of artistic practice flexible and un-self-conscious enough to allow studio art and product design to live side by side. The lesson is to just make it, and let the output fall where it may.","Studio art and product design live side by side at Token, a local hangout of sorts on Canal Street.",ae7dd05c-ca4b-5d99-9278-62ef838b7cd5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/fashion/14CRITICAL-1/14CRITICAL-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c7c32ef542c2ea87a3fe216ed6446e95257144f518608e2e5f72e664c8cad585&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Token, on Canal Street, where artists dabble in clothing.",ae7dd05c-ca4b-5d99-9278-62ef838b7cd5,N24News/imgs/ae7dd05c-ca4b-5d99-9278-62ef838b7cd5.jpg,15
Global Business,China's Central Bank Hits Brake on Hot Economy,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/13/business/global/13yuan.html,"HONG KONG  As most countries agonize over how to keep their barely reviving economies growing, China is already looking to slam on the brakes. China's central bank moved late Friday to reduce lending to companies and individuals by requiring large commercial banks to increase the amount of cash they park with the central bank. The move, which came earlier than most economists had expected, was meant to slow China's breakneck economy and inflation. It was the second time in a month that the central bank had directed the country's banks to increase reserves. In spite of the earlier edict, which took effect on Jan. 18, banks actually lent more money in January than in the previous three months combined, illustrating just how hard it is for Beijing to modulate its rapidly expanding economy. Chinese economists now predict the economy will grow about 10 percent this year, while Western economists put the figure closer to 12 percent. The growth reflects a revival of exports, strong consumer spending and heavy government investment in infrastructure projects like high-speed rail lines.

But authorities in Beijing are walking a delicate and difficult line. They consider controlling inflation as key to domestic peace because in the past the erosion of the spending power of workers has led to unrest. At the same time, if China brakes too hard, it risks slowing global growth overall and throwing other countries, including the United States, back into recession. For the first time in history, China's economy is acting as a major engine pulling the rest of the world out of recession. Economic reports Friday showed that most of Europe's major economies either shrank or barely grew in the fourth quarter of last year. The United States had strong growth in the fourth quarter, leaving many wondering when Washington will start increasing interest rates. The Federal Reserve has signaled it will be months. Fears that China's move Friday would slow global growth sent share prices sliding across Europe and pushed New York markets lower when they opened, though they recovered some of the losses. China's commercial banks have become important lenders to the rest of the world as American banks have considerably reduced lending.

""The timing is a surprise,"" said Qing Wang, an economist in the Hong Kong office of Morgan Stanley, referring to the central bank's action. Policy makers inject additional cash each year into the country's financial system before Lunar New Year to accommodate holiday spending. Raising the bank reserve ratio could prevent banks from turning that into loans for activities like real estate speculation.  Jing Ulrich, the managing director and chairwoman of China equities and commodities at J. P. Morgan, said, ""The message coming out of China has been quite clear  policy makers are becoming more concerned about containing inflationary expectations and managing the risk of asset price bubbles as a result of last year's aggressive expansion of credit."" Stephen Green, the head of greater China research in the Shanghai office of Standard Chartered Bank, said that he had been expecting one increase a month in the ratio for the foreseeable future as a way to slow the economy and the threat of inflation. The government began a stimulus plan of more than half-trillion dollars last year, and even before that Beijing had a huge public investment program to strengthen the country's infrastructure. At the same time, Chinese families are snapping up cars, apartments and other big-ticket items. China passed the United States last year to become the world's largest car market by number of vehicles sold. Car sales in January were more than double the level of a year earlier.

Families, real estate developers and industrial companies have all been borrowing heavily and have started paying more for everything from food to apartments. Last month apartment prices surged and the pace of wholesale inflation doubled. Chinese families have the cash to buy cars now partly because they still have extremely high savings rates by international standards and partly because the state-controlled banking sector went on a lending spree over the last year at the government's request. China's banks largely avoided investing in the mortgage-backed securities, credit-default swaps and other esoteric financial instruments that have caused tremendous damage to the balance sheets of Western banks in the last two years, leaving them less able or less willing to lend. The National Bureau of Statistics of China said Thursday that annual inflation in producer prices had more than doubled in January from December, to 4.3 percent. Average housing prices in large and midsize cities were up 9.5 percent last month from a year earlier, the fastest rate of increase in 19 months. Rising producer prices and asset prices have not yet fed into high inflation in consumer prices, which were up only 1.5 percent last month from a year earlier despite an increase in food prices. The central bank action Friday was aimed at keeping a tight rein on consumer prices. The central bank pushed up the reserve ratio by half a percentage point, to 16.5 percent, for large banks, and 14.5 percent for small banks, effective Feb. 25. Small financial institutions that mainly lend to farmers, like rural credit cooperatives, are temporarily exempted from the increase to make sure they can provide loans for spring planting. As the government tries to keep inflation in check, the conventional remedy in most industrialized countries would be to push up the interest rates that borrowers must pay for loans, typically through actions in money markets. But that would draw even more investment into China, at a time when the Chinese authorities are already struggling to control foreign cash that has been flowing in. Banks have been keeping about 18 percent of their assets at the central bank recently. But raising the minimum makes it less likely big banks will start lending that money.","For the second time in less than five weeks, China's central bank has moved to limit lending, a step that came earlier than most economists had expected.",f919f45d-e9f2-5569-9c70-f17191be2f37,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/02/13/business/global/13yuan-ready/13yuan-ready-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=d50548e8c66019fcc34111058b1dfd56559d904965edf0c0fc0253ee6b93aba7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A worker shown resting at a construction site of a real estate project in Guangzhou, China, last month.

Sports,"In Texas, the Land of Football, It's Rugby to the Rescue",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/sports/ncaafootball/football-rugby-texas-tackling-concussions.html,"ARLINGTON, Tex. -- Raymond Kitchen had other places he would rather have been than in a big, empty football stadium at 7 a.m. on a Saturday. But there he was, three days before Christmas, with 450 other high school football coaches, attending a two-hour lecture on tackling at AT&T Stadium, the home of the Dallas Cowboys. The lecture was a part of an ambitious effort to have all of the state's 23,000 junior high and high school football coaches become familiar with, by August, a program that teaches rugby-style tackling. It emphasizes the use of the shoulder, not the head, in bringing down the player with the ball. The program was created by Atavus, a company based in Seattle that says it can produce more effective tacklers by teaching defenders to square up before hitting a ball carrier and to use their shoulders and legs for leverage and power. Coaches like Kitchen seem receptive to the message Atavus is trying to popularize. ""It's where to put your head that is the focus now,"" Kitchen, a defensive coach at James Bowie High School in Arlington, said after he finished a written test that was a part of the certification. ""Every year, with C.T.E., every coach is now, 'Get your head out of it,'"" he added, using the initialism for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated hits to the head.

From the viewpoint of the Texas High School Coaches Association, any program that might reduce the number of head injuries in football, and the apprehension that they create, is worth looking at. Even if the program is inspired by a sport, rugby, that is much more prominent in other parts of the world than it is in the United States. After all, while participation in high school football in Texas has remained relatively steady over the past decade, the game is not growing here as fast as it once was. In part, that is because of specialization, which has locked some children into other sports. But another factor is the concern by a growing number of parents that football is simply too dangerous. That concern was clearly a part of the narrative at the seminar. Over and over, coaches who were present said the game was ""under attack,"" even in Texas, where football is nearly a religion. And to a man, they insisted that the benefits of the game -- which they maintain teaches grittiness and teamwork -- far outweighed its risks.

""The most important part of it is getting moms to realize that the game is safer than it probably ever has been because of coaches' awareness of concussions and all the things we're trying to teach them, and because of the tackling training that's coming on board,"" said D. W. Rutledge, who retired recently as the executive director of the Texas High School Coaches Association. Rutledge and the coaches association have tried to reassure skittish parents by adopting rules that govern when players can return to action after a concussion and also limit the number of full-contact practices. Now they have turned to the rugby-style tackling program in their latest, and perhaps most elaborate, attempt to convince skeptics that football can be made safer to play.

Rutledge and his second-in-command, Joe Martin, started searching for tackling programs about two years ago, concerned that state legislators might call for further restrictions on the sport. The most well-known tackling program was one designed by U.S.A. Football, which is funded by the N.F.L. But its emphasis was primarily on youth football. Rutledge and Martin wanted something that addressed older and more powerful athletes, and they were impressed with Atavus because of the dozens of techniques it uses to teach defenders how to approach ball carriers and bring them down. Pete Carroll, the coach of the Seattle Seahawks, has promoted ""hawk tackling,"" which borrows heavily from rugby. But Atavus, which works with coaches at Ohio State, Michigan State, Rutgers and other colleges, also uses video to analyze and rate tackles as well as identify additional drills to address deficiencies.

In seizing on rugby as a model, Atavus was choosing to highlight a sport in which tackling above the shoulder is not permitted; some players wear ""scrum caps'' but none wear the hard plastic helmets used in football; and the rate of concussions is lower than in football, according to Dawn Comstock, a sports injury epidemiologist at the Colorado School of Public Health. Rex Norris, a former football coach in Texas who helped develop the tackling program for Atavus, which is called Tacklytics, knew that some coaches might be suspicious of techniques borrowed from rugby, and consider them an attempt to soften the way football is played, even though rugby is a physical sport played by burly athletes. So he started his hourlong presentation last month with a blunt proclamation: ""We believe in tackling the legs,"" he told the coaches. ""We believe in body-on-body contact. And we believe in knocking the runner backward. We know how much this game is changing, and as coaches, we have to continue to change. We have to continue to change how we think, about how we practice."" Norris spoke to the coaches as a peer. But a part of him was akin to a physics professor trying to translate complex equations into simple concepts. Being an effective tackler, he told those at the seminar, was not just about bringing down a ball carrier, but about maximizing one's power and control. To tackle effectively, a defender must take the right angle to the ball, face the ball carrier and use his legs, hips and shoulder in concert. ""It's not how fast you are coming, but if you are under control,"" he said.

Common sense suggests that avoiding head hits will reduce concussions and curtail the many smaller impacts with the helmet that have also been linked to long-term brain disease. One of the effective ways to do that is limiting the number of full-contact practices, something promoted by groups like Practice Like Pros, which partners with Atavus. But the link between concussions in football and tackling programs that reduce exposure to the head is far from established. For example, U.S.A. Football walked back a study it released about how its Heads Up Football program had helped reduce concussions on the youth level. And one of the difficulties in designing rigorous studies is establishing just what led to players' concussions. They can get concussions for other reasons -- such as hitting their head on the turf -- that have nothing to do with tackling the ball carrier. Art Maerlender, the director of clinical research at the Center for Brain, Biology and Behavior at the University of Nebraska, in Lincoln, and a medical adviser to Atavus, said he was developing a ""more fine-grained analysis"" to account for all the variables that can lead to a concussion. Still, he noted, ""just reducing the amount of times you hit your head makes sense,"" he said. He also said that from his perspective, ""this focus on technique is really quite new in American football.'' At least anecdotally, the Atavus tackling technique appears to help. Rodney Webb, the head coach at Rockwall High School, about a half-hour's drive from Dallas, started using the program in 2016. While his players quickly learned the drills in practice, their results during games did not improve until the second season. In the season and a half since then, the number of missed tackles fell 30 percent, Webb said, and his varsity team had no concussions in the most recent season. ""When it comes to tackling, it is a safer practice and a better practice,"" he said of the rugby-style technique. ""It's a win-win.""

As in Texas, many states have introduced return-to-play guidelines following concussions, and have limited the number of full-contact practices. Some of those states are now looking at how the tackling-technique program is taking hold in Texas. Representatives from high school football coaches associations in Alabama, Georgia and Oklahoma, among others, have spoken to Rutledge and Martin about their experience with Atavus. Meanwhile, U.S.A. Football is beginning to promote its own rugby-style tackling program. But whether any program can reverse the tide of players joining other sports is another question. Coaches know that parental skepticism can run deep, even in Texas. ""I'm not the first one to say it, but football is dead in 15 years because mama doesn't want her kids to play the game,"" said Jim McDougle, an offensive coordinator at Bryan Adams High School in Dallas. ""You can be as safe as you want to be, but it's still a violent sport.""","Why rugby? Because its tackling techniques emphasize use of the shoulder, which increasingly appeals to football coaches leery of concussions. Even in Texas.",cbe7cfd4-a91f-534f-b7a6-319255b457a7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/03/sports/00tackling-top/00tackling-top-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=712565d0a6db1a17f680fddff803609891bacce87d100318c4e69979677e9cba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Football coaches watched a video during the tackling certification program at AT&amp;T Stadium in Arlington, Tex.",cbe7cfd4-a91f-534f-b7a6-319255b457a7,N24News/imgs/cbe7cfd4-a91f-534f-b7a6-319255b457a7.jpg,9
Automobiles,Three's a Crowd: The Bench Seat Is Benched,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/26/automobiles/threes-a-crowd-the-bench-seat-is-benched.html,"FULL-SIZE American sedans are an endangered species, and the front bench seat is fading away with them.

 That car, the current-generation Chevrolet Impala, will go away in a few months, too.

Front bench seats -- essentially a door-to-door couch -- were the default seating mode for most of the American car industry's history. Benches were cheaper to make than individual chairs, and they provided space for the most passengers. The column-mounted gear shifter, which freed space for a third passenger in the middle of the front seat, was a breakthrough when it appeared on Cadillacs and Pontiacs in 1938.","The 2013 Cadillac XTS comes with only front bucket seats, unlike the DTS it replaced, leaving only one new passenger car in the United States with an available front bench seat.",ee27ad2a-c22f-50f6-8545-0e2a545d0009,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/08/26/automobiles/26BENC/26BENC-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=6061df004b324184c8f322d959ce6002fd141fe6bc53ce28cc7b5601894eec8e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,IT'S A STRETCH The 1964 Buick Electra 225 came with wide open spaces.,ee27ad2a-c22f-50f6-8545-0e2a545d0009,N24News/imgs/ee27ad2a-c22f-50f6-8545-0e2a545d0009.jpg,23
Global Business,Chinese Power Player Places Risky Bet on Moviegoing,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/25/business/global/china-tycoon-places-risky-bet-on-us-movie-market.html,"BEIJING -- Hollywood studios, facing steep challenges in the North American movie market, are taking more interest in China. The Walt Disney Company and Marvel Studios, a division of Disney's Marvel Entertainment subsidiary, are producing ""Iron Man 3"" in China. News Corporation recently bought a stake in the Bona Film Group in Beijing. And an agreement with Chinese authorities will allow more American companies to distribute more movies and reap a greater share of the box office in China, the world's fastest-growing economy. But at least one billionaire businessman is betting that the American movie market is still the ticket to international success. And he is Chinese. Wang Jianlin, a rags-to-riches tycoon, is taking over AMC Entertainment, North America's second-largest movie theater chain behind Regal Entertainment. And he is promising to integrate it into a new, made in China, global brand called the Wanda Group.

Mr. Wang, 57, is regarded as one of the most successful Chinese real estate tycoons. His $17 billion empire includes huge commercial property developments, five-star hotels, tourist resorts, a film and television production company and Asia's largest cinema network. Now, by paying $2.6 billion to acquire AMC, the Wanda Group is extending its reach globally. The deal, announced Sunday, is still subject to the approval of United States regulators, though there are no hints it will be blocked. The purchase signifies a new era for Mr. Wang and in China's development. Companies here are moving away from low-cost manufacturing and going abroad in search of natural resources and global consumer brands, part of an effort to upgrade the nation's economy. In an interview at his spacious headquarters in Beijing, Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman, said he was pondering his next international destination: Europe. ""We're already negotiating,"" he said. Wanda is a private company in a nation dominated by state-owned enterprises. But the AMC deal is closely aligned with the Chinese government's priorities, which include encouraging Chinese companies to ""go global,"" pushing an overhaul of Chinese media and entertainment properties and placing greater emphasis on consumer spending.

But whether Wanda, a 24-year-old enterprise with little international experience, can make a success of such a big acquisition and create a global property and entertainment brand is debatable, analysts say. ""China has great entrepreneurs,"" says Duncan Clark, chairman of BDA China, a Beijing-based investment advisory firm. ""But the question is: How will they take these companies international? Are they going to be willing to learn and adapt?"" One of the biggest experiments in this area is being undertaken by Mr. Wang, a former army officer who has turned a tiny real estate venture into a national brand. Wanda, which started in Dalian, a northeastern city, and moved its headquarters to Wanda Plaza in Beijing, is a colossus with 183 million square feet of land under development or operation.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. In 1988, Mr. Wang -- who entered the army at 15, after middle school -- says he left a job as a local government official in Dalian and borrowed $80,000 to start a business he now describes as a ""sprinting elephant."" Wang Yongping, founder of the China Commercial Real Estate Association, described the chairman of Wanda as usually a step ahead of other Chinese real estate barons. ""He always has a vision,"" Mr. Wang, no relation, said. ""When everybody was doing housing property, he jumped out to focus on commercial property. When everybody was chasing commercial property, he was eyeing culture and tourism -- the industries that the government is stressing and cultivating.""

That few Chinese companies have managed to establish global brands is of little concern to Wanda's chairman. And buying a stake in a company focused on a quintessentially American experience -- moviegoing -- seemed hardly daunting for a man who survived the Cultural Revolution, a period of social and political madness in China. ""In setting goals and executing a strategy, Wanda is sophisticated,"" said Mr. Wang, the Wanda chairman. ""We have good systems and departments. If targets are not reached, a yellow light goes off."" Mr. Wang usually hits his targets, he says. The company has experienced 30 percent growth in the last year, even in a down market. And he promises that by 2015 the Wanda Group will have overall revenue of about $30 billion. Which raises the question: Why invest in the United States cinema market at a time of weakness, when box office receipts are sluggish and American film producers are looking to China?

Some analysts have suggested that Mr. Wang's acquisition of AMC was political, an effort to curry favor with Chinese leaders, who are pushing their nation to enhance its influence by exporting cultural products. Others contend that Mr. Wang is eager to establish himself as China's first global corporate chief. ""This is kind of a statement deal for him,"" said an executive familiar with the Wanda-AMC talks, but not authorized to discuss them. ""He's coming out of China, and this is an area he has great interest in. He kept emphasizing he just wants to learn how cinemas are operated in the U.S. It's not just about the money.""

But to pull off the deal, Wanda needed plenty of that: more than $3 billion in cash, including $500 million it has promised to invest in AMC in North America. Financing such a big deal in a tough credit environment, and with China's property market in a slump, was some feat. In the end, much of the cash came from China's big, state-controlled banks. To ensure that the deal succeeds, Mr. Wang said he would keep AMC's management in place with long-term pay incentives, and invest heavily in renovating older American theaters in an effort to bolster revenue. Asked whether AMC would show films that the Chinese government found offensive, such as one dealing with the contentious issue of rebellions in Tibet, Mr. Wang said he would not interfere with decisions by his management team in the United States. He also dismissed speculation in China that his ties to Bo Xilai, the fallen Politburo leader who also got his start in Dalian, could harm the Wanda Group. ""We knew each other, and were very familiar with one another,"" he said. ""But it was just a working relationship. There was no personal relationship."" He said the government had not asked to investigate the group. Throughout the interview, Mr. Wang -- who spoke calmly and quietly, and occasionally twirled his thumbs -- said he was focusing on targets and executing strategies, fast. Buying a Hollywood movie studio was not planned, he said, but he would not rule it out. Hotels and American shopping malls are more likely targets, he said. ""We don't have the strategy to go global in real estate,"" he said. ""But for globalization and going out, we would like to buy hotels and hotel management companies. We also like department stores.""","Wang Jianlin, a rags-to-riches mogul, is taking over AMC Entertainment and promising to integrate it into a global brand called the Wanda Group.",57fa4845-444d-5f0b-866b-ca87d54f5a60,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/05/25/business/WANDA/WANDA-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=cf1f83cb1b924182b3eae48733975e1e60894e989ade17fc927a09a2c77fa777&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Wang Jianlin, chairman of the Wanda Group, in Beijing.

Science,"China's Ban on Wildlife Trade a Big Step, but Has Loopholes, Conservationists Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/27/science/coronavirus-pangolin-wildlife-ban-china.html,"China this week announced a permanent ban on wildlife trade and consumption that international conservationists greeted as a major step, but one with troublesome loopholes for trade in wild animals for medicinal uses.

A wild animal market in Wuhan may have been where the outbreak of Covid-19 began, and pangolins, in particular, have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.

China had already banned the wildlife markets. The action on Monday by a standing committee of the 13th National People's Congress went further. The decision on ""Comprehensively Prohibiting the Illegal Trade of Wild Animals, Eliminating the Bad Habits of Wild Animal Consumption, and Protecting the Health and Safety of the People,"" bans all trade and eating of non-aquatic wild animals.

But, according to an analysis by the Wildlife Conservation Society, the decision does not ban trade for fur, medicine or research. ""This creates a potential loophole for traffickers who may exploit the nonfood exemptions to sell or trade live wildlife,"" the group said in a statement.","The coronavirus epidemic prompted China to permanently ban trade of wild animals as food, but not for medicinal use.",db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/27/science/27VIRUS-WILDLIFE/27VIRUS-WILDLIFE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=8bf0c6a8165e1dbb055d688530ff7d4f773699f6048da7e45f591a7610c17989&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Pangolins in particular have been proposed as a possible host of the virus before it jumped to people.,db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b,N24News/imgs/db88eea7-0634-5fd4-8cd4-f2ccbd47147b.jpg,2
Real Estate,"Celebrity Luxe, Then and Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/realestate/new-jersey-in-the-region-celebrity-luxe-then-and-now.html,"IN eastern Monmouth County, the name Hartshorne has plenty of resonance. In addition to Hartshorne Road and Hartshorne Woods Park, there's the Hartshorne mansion, a brick Tudor-style home on the banks of the Shrewsbury River in Little Silver. It was built in 1929 by the Olympic figure skater Harold Hartshorne. In eastern Morris County, it is the Gorga name that rings bells. One of the ""Real Housewives of New Jersey,"" Melissa Gorga, with her husband, Joe, has drawn much local attention since joining the show's cast two years ago. But the couple's palatial Montville home, built by Mr. Gorga, has in a way upstaged them. It draws a steady stream of celebrity hounds; they knock on the door and, when the famed owners appear, snap pictures. Both of these unusual houses are on the market, and even with their 80-year age difference, a comparison confirms a proverb: the more things change in the luxury real estate market, the more they stay the same.

Now for some stylistic differences: the Hartshorne living room's ceiling is crosshatched with beams imported from the Black Forest in Germany, while the Gorgas' is trimmed in decorative gold, with an enormous crystal chandelier descending halfway into the room. The Hartstorne home has 217 leaded-glass windows, many inset with stained-glass images of historical or allegorical figures. At the Gorga home, some windows are shaped like oversized Coke bottles; others run room height and width. Harold Hartshorne left his mark by including his initials in bas-relief on the gutter downspouts. Joe Gorga tipped his hat to his heritage by including limestone from Italy in the exterior. In addition to all the custom styling, the houses each have elements linked to their creators' career choices. For Harold Hartshorne, a five-time national champion, an Olympic silver and bronze medalist, and a primary force in ice-dancing, that meant building a skating pond, where he and his fellow skaters, including the Olympian and movie star Sonja Henie, could skate when the Shrewsbury River failed to freeze over. In the basement of the Gorga house, Mr. Gorga installed a state-of-the-art recording studio for his wife, who has produced several songs there, including two that have reached the Top 10 in downloads. Entertaining family and guests has been a central activity at both homes, and each has an enormous kitchen, though the Hartshorne kitchen wasn't expanded to its current size until 1987, by the house's current owners, Blair and Kurt Richter. The Gorgas -- whose family feuds with Mr. Gorga's sister Teresa Giudice, a fellow ""housewife"" on the program, are legendary -- felt it was necessary to have a large central island with a wraparound granite counter, for producing the kind of Italian feasts their relatives have come to expect. ""We have a huge family and I love to entertain,"" Mrs. Gorga said. ""But we also wanted it to be kid-friendly so it would feel like home for them."" She pointed out her 2- and 4-year-old sons, who ran between the kitchen and two playrooms on a recent steaming hot day. (Her 6-year-old daughter was at school.)

Selling a house owned or once occupied by a celebrity has its challenges. And in the case of a historic house, so does setting the price. Two doors down from the Hartshorne mansion, which is listed for $5.9 million, a similarly sized 11-year-old house is on the market for almost $2 million more; it is viewed as having all the latest modern conveniences. But the difference doesn't bother Sarah Pomphrey of Coldwell Banker, the agent for the Hartshorne property, who knows she has something unique, on 4.5 acres edged on three sides by 870 feet of waterfront.

""I can show you waterfront houses all day long, and I can show you big houses all day long,"" she said, ""but here you have a historic house, in great shape, on the water. How many of those are there out there?"" Mr. Richter, the seller, said it hadn't been the original occupant who had drawn him to the eight-bedroom house 25 years ago. (Hartshorne died in 1961 in a plane crash, en route to coach a skating competition in Belgium. Before the Richters, the house had two other owners.) ""That Harold Hartshorne lived here was not as important as the style and charm,"" Mr. Richter said. ""I'm European by nature, and this house spoke to me."" He and his wife decided to sell because their children have grown and moved away. The Gorgas say they're selling because they want to move back to Franklin Lakes, where they lived before coming to Montville. They say they plan to build a house as big as this one -- perhaps larger. (They denied recent reports that they can't afford to live in their Montville house and are planning to scale back.) Listed with Jerome Sahlman of Re/Max Village Square at $3.8 million, the house has a limited market, but that hasn't stopped people from trying to get a look inside. To sort bona fide potential buyers from the merely curious, the agent requires visitors to qualify for more than $5 million in financing, according to Mrs. Gorga. Also, there are no open houses planned. That said, Mr. Gorga, who has built custom houses throughout Bergen, Morris and Passaic Counties, feels their notoriety can't hurt. ""I believe if someone's really a fan and they have this type of money,"" he said, ""they can say, 'I love them, and I bought their house.' ""","Two palatial houses on the market — one in Little Silver, the other in Montville — have style and age differences, but also a surprising amount in common.",68868aa6-4306-563b-b3f5-6045da52c39b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/07/01/realestate/01NJZONE_SPAN/01NJZONE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=350&w=600&s=7255b51c727fc7ae2f5a5e7710c5064b6368f8d93d0b5901d2f3f8e393918144&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Montville home of a ""Real Housewives"" star.",68868aa6-4306-563b-b3f5-6045da52c39b,N24News/imgs/68868aa6-4306-563b-b3f5-6045da52c39b.jpg,7
Health,Job Prospects Are Dimming for Radiology Trainees,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/health/trainees-in-radiology-and-other-specialties-see-dream-jobs-disappearing.html,"For years, medical students who chose a residency in radiology were said to be on the ROAD to happiness. The acronym highlighted the specialties -- radiology, ophthalmology, anesthesiology and dermatology -- said to promise the best lifestyle for doctors, including the most money for the least grueling work. Not anymore. Radiologists still make twice as much as family doctors, but are high on the list of specialists whose incomes are in steepest decline. Recent radiology graduates with huge medical school debts are having trouble finding work, let alone the $400,000-and-up dream jobs that beckoned as they signed on for five to seven years of relatively low-paid labor as trainees. On Internet forums, younger radiology residents agonize about whether it is too late to switch tracks. At St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx, a dozen radiologists in training, including Dr. Luke Gerges, 28, are suddenly stranded on an expensive road to nowhere. All received termination notices recently because their hospital is ending their residency program next year as part of a plan to replace its radiologists with a teleradiology company that reads diagnostic images remotely. ""Those days of raking in the dough with radiology are gone,"" said Dr. Gerges, who is four years beyond medical school and $300,000 in debt. He said he chose a specialty he loves without caring that big salaries were waning, but never imagined it would be this hard to finish his postgraduate training and get a job.

""No one is going to hire me to be a radiologist without my training,"" he said. Few specialties have been immune to the same factors depressing radiology: deep Medicare cuts, cut-rate competition driven by technology, doubts about the health value of many tests and procedures and new measures to tilt public money to primary care. The case of St. Barnabas may be extreme, said Dr. Paul H. Ellenbogen, chairman of the American College of Radiology, the principal organization of the nation's 30,000 radiologists, who called the hospital's treatment of the residents ""unconscionable."" But it is part of a larger pattern that has made radiology the target of a dozen cuts in Medicare reimbursement since 2006, he said, totaling $6 billion. ""We were somewhat victims of our success,"" said Dr. Ellenbogen, in Dallas, whose career spans what radiologists call the golden years, when the cost of diagnostic imaging grew faster than other items in health care. Starting in the 1980s, the advent of technology like M.R.I.'s and CT scans, combined with a fee-for-service system, created ballooning demand for imaging and drove the compensation of radiologists to unsustainable heights, he said. ""That led to a sense of entitlement in some people's minds,"" he said. ""And that led to this development of offshore remote reading of cases."" By 2001, with the supply of radiologists limited by a 1997 Congressional cap on all Medicare-supported residencies, nighttime demand was unmanageable for smaller emergency rooms. So-called nighthawk radiology services began pooling the diagnostic imaging loads of several hospitals and transmitting them electronically to American radiologists stationed overseas or working from home.

Though outsourcing to India grabbed headlines, the big growth in teleradiology was domestic. Now the nighthawk companies, staffed by recent radiology graduates, are competing for the daytime work, too. St. Barnabas pays radiology residents $48,000 to $60,000 a year and collects about $150,000 for each in ""direct graduate medical education"" Medicare payments, which, besides their pay, is supposed to cover malpractice insurance and education in the program, accredited by the American Osteopathic Association. But the hospital will not release the money to other programs where the radiology residents could complete their training, Steven Clark, a hospital spokesman, said, because it plans to use the money to expand primary-care residencies. That decision could be seen as a small victory for national policies intended to bolster primary care. But to many St. Barnabas residents, it mainly shows that the system of graduate medical education is broken.

""If the model becomes that everything is remote reading, it comes at the expense of training,"" said Dr. Nirav Shelat, another third-year radiology resident. ""Are we going to allow our trainees to essentially be kicked out by corporations?"" St. Barnabas, a 461-bed community hospital that lost $10 million last year and pays its chief executive nearly $1 million annually, now contracts with a traditional group practice of 18 radiologists to be its radiology department. Mr. Clark would not name the companies competing to replace the group practice, but said, ""From a cost-cutting perspective and from a quality perspective, you can have a lot more people reading X-rays remotely than you can inside the hospital."" In desperation to find a new traineeship. Dr. David Zelman, a fourth-year resident, offered to work without pay. He said hospitals told him that it would be unethical to accept free labor, or that training him would still be too costly without additional money for malpractice insurance and benefits.

One hospital, McLaren Macomb, in suburban Detroit, instead offered several residents slots in its ""unfunded program,"" in which most radiology residents essentially pay for their own positions through donations, typically from a spouse or parents: $65,000 a year to cover a $42,000 salary and $2,000 for expenses. ""Obviously it would be your last choice, but if there are no open funded positions and you can scrounge up the funds, keep it in mind,"" the program director, Dr. Eli Shapiro, wrote in an e-mail to Dr. Gerges. Dr. Shapiro, 57, added in an interview that every specialty was clamoring for more residents. ""They're nice to have,"" he said, ""especially when there's a call at 3 o'clock in the morning. They're around and I'm not."" Despite declining prospects, competition for many traineeships is fiercer because the number of medical school graduates has grown by a third since 2002. ""The way this whole medical education is, you're essentially just in an indentured servitude position,"" said Dr. Tom Chen, a first-year radiology resident at St. Barnabas from Queens. The demand for imaging began to slow after 2006, even as technology increased productivity, studies show. Besides reimbursement cuts and rising deductibles, factors that curbed the scans included new concerns about radiation and useless tests. Compensation began to drop. Last year, an annual salary survey of 24,000 physicians by Medscape, an online resource for doctors, found radiologists and orthopedic surgeons still topped the list of specialties, but their mean incomes had dropped by 10 percent between 2010 and 2011, to $315,000 from $350,000.

Your Money,"In Lending Circles, a Roundabout Way to a Higher Credit Score",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/11/your-money/raising-a-credit-score-from-zero-to-789-in-26-months.html,"Shweta Kohli has always paid her own way. Her straight-A average won her a full scholarship to San Francisco State University at the same time she worked a 40-hour week as a waitress at a cafe. But when she applied for a credit card after graduation, she was turned down because she had no credit history. So three years ago, Ms. Kohli, now 34, joined a lending circle -- a small group of people who chip in every month to lend money to one another at no interest. Managed by the Mission Asset Fund, a nonprofit group in San Francisco that works with credit-rating agencies, the circle offered Ms. Kohli something no bank would: a chunk of cash and a chance to build a credit score. After faithfully making payments -- and socking away enough to buy a 1997 Ford Mustang -- she raised her credit score from zero to 789 in 26 months. Ms. Kohli, ever the striver, said: ""My goal is to keep it at 850, the highest."" While informal lending circles among families, acquaintances, co-workers and neighbors are familiar to hundreds of millions of people all over the globe, they are rarely recognized by mainstream financial institutions.

But now these centuries-old networks are being seen as a promising tool to help low-income Americans build credit records, part of a new frontier of the war on poverty that has attracted a crazy-quilt coalition of supporters that include major banks, immigrant activists and academic researchers. In August, California became the first state to enact a law allowing nonprofits to offer small no-interest, no-fee loans, attracting unanimous support from Republican and Democratic lawmakers. ""It crosses party lines, it crosses ideological lines because it's so simple,"" said State Senator Lou Correa, a Democrat from Santa Ana who sponsored the bill. ""Access to credit is very important in breaking the cycle of poverty,"" Mr. Correa said. Without a credit score, you cannot get a car loan, rent an apartment, obtain a mortgage or build a business. Prospective employers and even dating services frequently check credit scores, which a credit-rating agency generates based on a person's history of debt and payments. ""It's very hard to be a part of the economic mainstream"" without credit, said Amy Brown, a program officer at the Ford Foundation. ""Over time, it makes it really hard to build wealth and move up."" As many as 64 million Americans lack this type of paper trail, leading them to rely on alternatives like exorbitantly priced payday lenders and check-cashing stores.

""A credit report is like a passport to the financial marketplace,"" said Jose Quinonez, the chief executive of Mission Asset Fund. ""Without that passport, you're denied entry."" Making payments on time to other members of the lending circle is just like paying off a bank loan or a credit card, supporters point out. The only difference is that one activity is recorded -- and can therefore be used to build a credit score -- and the other is not. ""Credit scores are calculated with data that is too narrow,"" argues a new report on informal lending and saving tools from U.S. Financial Diaries, a research study of low- and moderate-income families: ""It may be just as relevant to a lender whether a prospective borrower has the discipline to make regular savings deposits as to make regular loan payments."" After months of faithfully making payments -- and socking away enough to buy a 1997 Ford Mustang. Advocates and financial institutions have increasingly been looking for new ways to assist those who are off the financial grid to plug into the system, said Robert Annibale, global director of community development and microfinance at Citibank, which is investing in several pilot projects. Some banks offer credit building loans -- a kind of loan with training wheels -- in which people borrow money for the sole purpose of paying it back. The Credit Builders Alliance, a membership organization of nonprofits, helps low and moderate-income households report payments like rent to credit-rating agencies. Mission Asset Fund formalizes the informal loans arranged through lending circles by making sure all the participants sign a contract or promissory note and reporting every payment to national credit bureaus.

The fund represents only a minuscule portion of the lending industry -- through partnerships with 26 other nonprofit organizations it has facilitated about $3 million worth of loans among 2,200 people -- but the Ford Foundation has recently issued a $350,000 grant to help expand its program nationwide. ""It's a new take on efforts to build credit,"" Ms. Brown said. ""It's sort of brilliant, as a social justice philanthropy."" The fund has also received support from some big banks, including JPMorgan Chase and Citibank. Mr. Quinonez, the fund's director and a native of Mexico, said his own family used lending circles when he was growing up. The conventional view that low-income people are financially illiterate, he says, is mistaken. ""They were managing money in ways we just didn't understand or conceptualize,"" he said. Known as tandas in Mexico, susus in West Africa, pandeiros in Brazil and huis in Asia, these informal savings and lending networks continue to be a mainstay of immigrant communities around the country. Generally, each member of a small group -- usually six to 10 people -- contributes a set amount of money, say $100, on a regular schedule for a set period of time. Each member of the circle in turn receives the whole pot until everyone gets a payout. Circles continually disband and regroup. Mission Asset Fund, which also provides extensive financial counseling and education, markets its lending circles around what it calls ""financial pain points"": a security deposit to rent an apartment, the $680 citizenship application fee, the $465 fee for a deportation deferral and a temporary work permit. Saving for the deferral is what led Alan Santos, now a 21-year-old college student and part-time debate coach, to join a lending circle two years ago to lift his credit score of zero. ""Now it's almost 700,"" he said proudly.

Immigrants are the primary users, but not the only ones. Lending circles administered by the San Francisco Lesbian Gay Bisexual Transgender Community Center, for example, have a zero default rate. ""What they have is a social connection,"" said Mr. Quinonez, whose group teams up with the center, ""and that's what made them perform really well."" Just as dieters join Weight Watchers instead of going it alone, people join lending and savings circles to help reach a specific goal. A few commercial services aimed at organizing lending circles, including Yattos, Puddle and eMoneyPool, have recently sprung up. They help clients form circles using their own Facebook and social media contacts. Users generally provide each other with no- or low-interest loans but pay the company a coordination fee. Payment activities are not regularly reported to the credit-rating agencies, however, so they do not count toward a participant's credit score. As for Ms. Kohli, she is now working for a software company in the San Francisco Bay Area and has joined another lending circle to save for a condominium so she can move out of the one-bedroom she shares with two roommates. Her wallet contains a range of credit cards -- American Express, Discover, Visa and Master Card -- but she said she only used them to buy gas. She prefers to pay for everything she buys, up front and in cash.",Lending circles — groups of people who lend money to one another at no interest — are seen as a promising tool to help low-income Americans build their credit records.,fd3dc966-1023-55df-be1c-7881389e8278,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/11/business/CIRCLES1/CIRCLES1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=e37fcf83e0bf1bcadb9e62862527256a25255142d0abb508417fccb4977eede4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Shweta Kohli joined a lending circle, which offered her the chance to build her credit score.",fd3dc966-1023-55df-be1c-7881389e8278,N24News/imgs/fd3dc966-1023-55df-be1c-7881389e8278.jpg,21
Dance,Catch the Vibe: Club Culture Comes to Life at Lincoln Center,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/arts/dance/ephrat-asherie-underscore-works-and-process.html,"It's more than just another dance film born during the pandemic, because it is more than a dance. It's a celebration of a culture: the underground scene of New York City. ""UnderScored,"" by Ephrat Asherie, is also a rush, gliding across the screen like a wave of motion. The progression of rhythm, of bodies, of momentum are thrilling. It doesn't matter that the video, shot on the Lincoln Center campus, is short (it flies by at just under three minutes); it has layers of club culture and spirit embedded within it. Ms. Asherie has never made something so authentically herself. And its sheer exuberance? Well, that is Ms. Asherie.

A choreographer with a passion for club life and social dance forms -- house, breaking, vogue -- Ms. Asherie, like many in the field, found herself with a dance and no place to show it. ""UnderScored,"" part of her multifaceted project exploring the lineage of street and club dance, was originally scheduled to premiere in October at Works & Process at the Guggenheim. Instead it became a video project, one of four in a series directed by Nic Petry in collaboration with the artists and presented by Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and Works & Process. It will be available indefinitely starting at 7:30 p.m. Eastern time on Sunday. (When performances resume, it will eventually be shown in its complete form.) Of course, for a dancer like Ms. Asherie, the pandemic has affected more than her work in the concert dance world. ""The nightlife scene in New York City has been hit so hard,"" she said. ""It's really been incredible to see how D.J.s and promoters are doing their thing on Twitch or on Instagram.""

""UnderScored"" is a homage both to that world and to its veterans, and it features appearances by two of them: Michele Saunders, 77, and Archie Burnett, 61. Ms. Asherie said that the recent deaths of two important street dance innovators, Don Campbell and Tyrone Proctor, were on her mind. ""I just felt like, let's collaborate with the elders when they're here,"" she said. ""Why are we waiting to celebrate them?"" She and the dancers worked on the choreography in a bubble residency at Kaatsbaan Cultural Park in Tivoli, N.Y., but being on site at Lincoln Center made her understand exactly how she wanted it to look: shot, basically, in one take. ""It was exciting to have this feeling of wanting to be in conversation with the space,"" she said. ""It was so clear to me when I got there: Oh, I want this to feel like one sweeping movement, because so much of what we've done has been interrupted by the pandemic.""

Mr. Petry, a dancer who heads the media company Dancing Camera, understands the relationship between choreography and the camera. ""Often the hardest part for me is that the dance is the dance and you want it to remain true to what it is,"" he said. ""What was so fun and so great about Ephrat is how collaboratively she was interested in working. She was like, 'Let me do something that would really work for this part.' So it was actually making something new, which is very exciting."" ""UnderScored,"" set to Sam One's pulsating track ""Kitale,"" feels urgent and alive: a visceral response to the moment. ""The reason I've been riding my bike like a maniac in the pandemic is because I need to move through space,"" Ms. Asherie said. ""As dancers, I feel like our whole sense of time and space has shifted so dramatically. When this opportunity came up, I was like, how do we take up space? How do we show that we're here?"" Ms. Asherie, known in the dance world as Bounce, spoke about her film, which transports the cast from confined spaces to the open air, about what it's like to dance with trees (and other household objects) and about the importance of her club elders.

What follows are edited excerpts from that conversation. What was the biggest challenge in shooting ""UnderScored""? It's a huge space to cover. You can plan in your head, but ultimately it's also this dialogue with the videographer. It was so much about the moment and the joy of creating something so unexpected in a short amount of time after you've been alone and overthinking everything so much. The thing about the one-take feel is that it's the closest to a performance. How did you choose the sites for your dance? I knew right away that I wanted to be in the slats on the side of the [Metropolitan Opera] house, because that is also very much how confined we've been and separated from one another -- and then slowly we break out of that. What is the root of the choreography in that opening moment? We called it the ""'rona phrase,"" because I made it in my living room. I was like, we just need to be dancing. This is at the top of the pandemic; I'm like, we're just going to make a really long phrase, and every time we have rehearsal, I'm going to add four, five, six, seven, eight counts. And we're going to do it every time we rehearse to keep our stamina up. The slats are really reflective of our Zoom squares and our confinement in those squares. So that phrase represents the beginning of our experience in this time. The film unfolds like chapters to me. How did the section in the trees happen? We need to frolic. There are trees! You can't not use them. I also have a weird amount of standing lamps in my apartment. At one point, I put all three of them on the floor, and I was like, these are my dance partners right now. I was moving through these lamps. And this was before the Lincoln Center thing was in my mind, but then I saw the trees and I was like, oh my God -- people don't even know, but we were dancing by ourselves with our lamps. Or whatever -- with our brooms! I'm sure everybody did some kind of crazy stuff like that. We all did it.

What do Michele Saunders and Archie Burnett represent here? They're the ones that have paved the way. If you ever see footage of the Paradise Garage, Michele was in it. She was there all the time in full-out costume -- die-hard, like going to the club with a suitcase and multiple outfits to change her costume. At Kaatsbaan, we would rehearse all day and then we'd go back and have big family dinners, and then Archie and Michele would dance for hours in the living room. That kind of energy -- that is the reason there is a club scene. What does that mean to you? It's like celebrating the reason that we're doing what we're doing. The energy that they share with us is so generous and magnanimous. I'm never going to leave a party early again ever. Once we're back at the club, I'm staying until closing every single night. So that's why. Because we are because of them.","The choreographer Ephrat Asherie unveils her short film ""UnderScored,"" which pays homage to the history of the underground scene and its veterans.",b4c1ff36-bd3f-5b0f-9c65-6ba447e41adf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/15/arts/15ephrat-1/15ephrat-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1f5beab3fe7c4f497ad56d622505979275eb16eb9159b70d21ca7ad64880e92c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The choreographer and dancer Ephrat Asherie at Lincoln Center last week.,b4c1ff36-bd3f-5b0f-9c65-6ba447e41adf,N24News/imgs/b4c1ff36-bd3f-5b0f-9c65-6ba447e41adf.jpg,6
Fashion & Style,More Than Just a Suitcase,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/fashion/gifts-luggage.html,"LONDON -- If you've ever felt a tinge of embarrassment when picking up your old suitcase from the carousel, now is a good time to upgrade. And when it comes to a good gift, luggage might not be what immediately comes to mind -- but as companies re-evaluate the potential of the sector, things are changing. The financial possibilities are clear. While the global market for high-end personal goods is on track for its weakest year since 2016, the luxury luggage sector has not just proved resilient -- it is thriving. The value of the global luxury travel goods market is expected to reach $4.31 billion in 2016 and it is predicted to grow by 16 percent by 2020, to $5 billion, according to data from the market research company Euromonitor. In October, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton paid $716 million for an 80 percent stake in Rimowa, and early in the year Louis Vuitton capitalized on its association with travel with an exhibition in Paris, ""Volez, Voguez, Voyagez,"" or ""Sail, Fly, Travel,"" which displayed trunks used by Edwardian aristocrats alongside luggage once owned by Lauren Bacall and Elizabeth Taylor. And Samsonite International kicked off 2016 with its $1.8 billion acquisition of Tumi. ""Consumers -- especially rich consumers -- are spending more money on services and less on products,"" said Luca Solca, head of global luxury goods at Exane BNP Paribas. ""Among these, travel is at the of the top of the list. Luggage benefits from this.""

According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization, we are traveling more than ever. Last year the total number of international tourist arrivals grew by 4.4 percent, to reach a total of 1.2 billion, according to the organization's latest World Tourism Barometer. ""Luggage has been an incredibly strong category for us, especially in the past few months, as we've seen an increase in international visitors,"" Caroline Fielder, contemporary accessories and travel buyer at the London department store Selfridges, said, adding that sales recently got an extra boost from the weak British pound. She also noted that Rimowa, the store's most popular brand, had a sales increase of 16 percent in the 12 months to October 2016. Part of Rimowa's appeal for travelers -- and, no doubt, for LVMH -- is its new range of built-in electronic tags, introduced last month. The feature allows travelers to use their smartphones to add their airlines' luggage tags to their suitcases remotely, rather than waiting at check-in for tags to be printed. Prices start at $770 for a carry-on.

The German luggage giant follows the lead taken by a new generation of luggage start-ups shaking up the industry, aiming squarely at Airbnb-bound millennial travelers. These companies recognize the need to combine sleek no-nonsense design, smart functionality and Instagram-worthy branding that taps the romance long associated with travel. ""When we looked at the market we couldn't believe it. The last real innovation was adding wheels, and that was in 1970,"" said Tomi Pierucci, an entrepreneur and one of the founders of the luggage company Bluesmart. The company was introduced in November 2014 through an Indiegogo appeal that raised $2.2 million. Bluesmart's most recent model, the Black Edition ($599), allows its owners to charge their smartphones multiple times, has a smartphone-activated digital lock and GPS tracking and even weighs its own contents. For Mr. Pierucci, creating a brand that meshed with the values of experience-hungry millennials was the priority: ""You can make the mistake of adding in technology for the sake of it with a product like this. We wanted to create a cool, useful product for people who love travel."" The first retailer to stock the luggage was the MoMA Design Store; it now is sold at 200 stores, including Isetan in Tokyo, Lane Crawford in Hong Kong and Saks Fifth Avenue in New York. Away, a company started in November 2015 by Jen Rubio and Steph Korey, two alumni of the fashionable glasses label Warby Parker, created a minimalist suitcase design with an embedded smartphone charger. Away's first year has brought almost breakneck global expansion, including pop-up stores in London and Los Angeles and a permanent store in New York. ""When we started doing research we found there were two options: cheap junk that easily breaks, or high-quality products that are very expensive,"" Ms. Korey said, adding that Away's aim was to create ""a thoughtful, simple, exactly-what-you-need version."" The company is on track to sell 50,000 suitcases this year; for its holiday collection, it has introduced two special edition colors, a stark matte white and a slate gray. The cases are available in four sizes, from $255 for a carry-on to $295 for the largest size. The Away sotre in London. The company was started in November 2015 by Jen Rubio and Steph Korey. Billie Faricy-Hyett, senior buyer for bags and accessories at the online retailer Net-a-Porter, said, ""I believe this is just the start of the tech journey for luggage and we are excited to see how the category develops."" The company will be selling Raden in late November, another new brand that offers embedded smart technology. Raden, which sells just two sizes of luggage for $295 and $395, in a range of colors, is expected to meet its target of $12 million in sales in its first financial year, according Josh Udashkin , its founder, a former lawyer and director for the shoe retailer Aldo.

There is a shift in how luggage is marketed, Ms. Faricy-Hyett added, as brands recognize that the market extends beyond middle-aged male business executives. ""Traditionally, luggage has often been geared towards men, but brands are now starting to recognize the potential of the female market."" This is perhaps of little surprise, given that the media is saturated by images of celebrities effortlessly gliding off long-haul flights. Invariably they are accompanied by perfectly coordinated luggage that is neither scuffed nor bulging. Luggage's image overhaul -- and its financial potential -- has not escaped fashion houses and heritage brands. Karl Lagerfeld played with the idea in his spring 2016 Chanel airport show, transforming the Grand Palais into Aeroport Paris Cambon complete with desks manned by ""Chanel Airlines"" attendants and an accessories offering that focused on wheeled suitcases. The Australian designer Marc Newson reinvented Louis Vuitton's luggage design in July, with a collection of roller cases (from $3,700) in pink, yellow and orange versions with minimal branding -- a first for the French heritage brand known for its monogrammed trunks. The blend of form and function is evident in the new 19 Degree range by Tumi, a Frank Gehry-worthy collection of aluminum luggage ($995 to $1,195). The British brand Globe-Trotter, which made luggage for Queen Elizabeth's honeymoon in 1947, has also shifted its approach to entice a younger, hipper customer. The company showed its latest collection at the recent London Fashion Week -- a first in its 120-year history, including its new Propeller accessories line (prices from $200 for a coin pouch). In the summer, Smythson introduced the Greenwich (starting at $2,295), its first wheeled suitcase design in its 129-year history.",Improvements in design and functionality are driving growth in luggage sales.,5c4effdf-5711-5284-b742-9e771c4d08e7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/28/fashion/28luggage01-inyt/28luggage01-inyt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b45904acd498041676a510a45d755108c9d7e0ab742f0fe48f5534312049798e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The spring 2016 Chanel collection, with wheeled suitcases, by Karl Lagerfeld.",5c4effdf-5711-5284-b742-9e771c4d08e7,N24News/imgs/5c4effdf-5711-5284-b742-9e771c4d08e7.jpg,19
Books,The Civil Rights Movement Photographer Who Was Also an F.B.I. Informant,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/books/review/preston-lauterbach-bluff-city.html,"When Ernest Withers was a press photographer in Memphis in the mid-1950s, he put a slogan on his business cards: PICTURES TELL THE STORY. Indeed they did. He was no effete aesthete; he was a working reporter, one whose job was to get there, get in close, get the powerful shot and (if all went well) get paid. He was African-American, often publishing in The Chicago Defender and Jet magazine; drawn toward the biggest story around, he was soon covering the civil rights movement. And because he was good at his job, those pictures have vigor and punch. At the trial of Emmett Till's murderers, he defied a judge's no-cameras order and got off one quick, sharp frame as an accuser fingered one of the killers. He hung around a local blues club and photographed the rising star Elvis Presley as he soaked up the local musical culture he later reinterpreted for the rest of the world. He was with Martin Luther King Jr. aboard one of the first integrated bus rides in Montgomery, Ala., in 1956, and he was there when King lay in a funeral home in 1968.

Which made it all the more astounding when, a few years after his death in 2007, the truth came out. Starting in the early 1960s, Withers had spent nearly two decades as a paid informant of the F.B.I., feeding its agents information about the activists he photographed. He not only informed; he took requests. At one anti-Vietnam War march, he was asked to photograph all of the 30-odd protesters, taking special care to catch all their faces, and he turned 80 8-by-10 prints over to his F.B.I. contact. On occasion, he sold his work to a local paper, then gave copies to the bureau. His daughter Rosalind, the youngest of his nine children and the one who handles his estate, was blindsided when the news came out via a series of FOIA requests and legal fights undertaken by Marc Perrusquia, a reporter from The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. Perrusquia wrote about Withers and the revelation of his intelligence work in his own book, ""A Spy in Canaan,"" which was published last year. It's a smart journalist's book, crisply marching through Withers's F.B.I. records and the paper's battle to pry them out of the government's grip. ""Bluff City,"" by Preston Lauterbach, aims instead for something less snappy and more lyrical. Its subtitle is ""The Secret Life of Photographer Ernest Withers,"" which suggests that it's a biography, but it isn't quite that, or at least not a comprehensive one. Big stretches of Withers's life get a fairly cursory look, and Lauterbach basically calls it a day after King's assassination in 1968, dispatching the photographer's subsequent four decades in an introductory chapter and an afterword. Nor is this a book about photography history, examining the photographs the way an art historian might. There are 18 pictures, most, though not all, by Withers, enough to hit the main points but no more. (Which is fine. Decisions about including photos in a book like this tend to be limited by the cost of rights, and anyway there are several nice volumes of Withers's pictures out there. Or, you know, Google.) Instead what Lauterbach, a former Memphis resident and the author of two other books set in the South, ""Beale Street Dynasty"" and ""The Chitlin' Circuit,"" is going for is a loose, rangy history of the civil rights movement in Memphis, using Withers and his camera as the (literal) lens. He's done the work, tracking the complex, intertwined dances of the radicals and the centrists, the local ministers and visiting heavyweights like King. Weirdly, though, his very thoroughness and deep interest in this time and place have the almost certainly unintended effect of diminishing Withers rather than keeping him front and center. There are long stretches where, say, Stokely Carmichael appears, and we get 10 enthusiastic pages about his politics and S.N.C.C. and the dynamics between Carmichael and King, and then Withers pokes his head in to snap a few pictures and go meet his F.B.I. contact. Some of those scenes are nicely wrought, but the secrets in this life are often other people's rather than Withers's own.

The narrative tightens up and gains momentum as it builds toward that deadly evening at the Lorraine Motel. Much of the book is structured around the final days of King's life, as he tried to manage a sanitation strike in Memphis that turned violent, leaving him dejected. That was the protest at which Withers shot his best-known photo, of a line of strikers bearing signs that read I AM A MAN. The men are carrying the signs on sticks that Withers himself helped saw, and when the march turned violent, those pine two-by-twos became weapons. (Lauterbach expends some energy trying to figure out whether Withers had supplied them in hopes of creating a stir.) A week later, Withers was not on the scene when King was shot, although he arrived shortly after. Those famous pictures of King's associates, pointing toward the direction of the rifle shot? Withers didn't take them, but the young South African photographer who did, Joseph Louw, was too rattled to develop them himself, and nearly botched the processing. Withers stepped into the darkroom alongside him and made sure it got done right. The central question a reader is likely to ask of this book (and of Perrusquia's as well) is: Why did a man whose life and work were knitted into the civil rights movement feed information to J. Edgar Hoover? The F.B.I. director's explicit goals, after all, were to disrupt all the organizing, to drain the movement's influence, to humiliate and destroy King. Lauterbach has a few theories, and all are probably true to varying degrees. For one thing, Withers needed the money. He raised his big family on a freelance photographer's pay, and put most of his kids through college. (Some civil rights activists from the era say that, since they were operating in the open, Withers was not betraying them but simply conning the F.B.I. for some cash.) For another, he disliked the anti-American language on the fringier end of the left, especially when it turned communistic. He was preternaturally inclined toward a law-and-order point of view. In fact, he'd been a cop before he was a photographer, and a crooked one at that. In the early 1950s, he left the Memphis Police Department involuntarily, after he'd been caught selling illegal liquor under the table. Twenty-four years later, he was appointed to the state Alcoholic Beverage Control Board -- and then was stung again, this time by the F.B.I. itself, as he worked a scheme to get a prisoner out of jail in exchange for a cash payment to the governor. ""Bluff City"" may not get to Withers's inner life, but it is not without pleasure. Lauterbach is justifiably sympathetic to his subject, noting that one has to be generous about judging the things a black man in the Jim Crow South did to get by. (Withers was beaten during at least one march he covered.) And Lauterbach likes the other central character in the book even better, that being Memphis itself. In his first chapter, he describes a day in 2005 when he dropped by Withers's studio for a tour and got a lift home from the photographer in that old sedan. ""He drove -- in a manner many people familiar with Memphis will recognize -- slowly, drifting right.""

Economy,Trump Said to Pick Nominees for 2 Positions on Fed Board,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/02/business/economy/federal-reserve-board-nominees-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration has selected candidates for at least two of the three open positions on the Federal Reserve's Board of Governors, according to people with direct knowledge of the decision. The expected nominees include Randal K. Quarles, a Treasury Department official in the George W. Bush administration, and Marvin Goodfriend, a former Fed official who is now a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University. In picking Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend, President Trump is seeking to install conservative counterweights to the Fed's chairwoman, Janet L. Yellen. Both men have expressed reservations about the Fed's aggressive efforts to revive economic growth since the 2008 crisis. Mr. Quarles would also become a leading figure in the administration's efforts to roll back financial regulation. He would be nominated to serve as the Fed's vice chairman for supervision, with responsibility for overseeing the Fed's regulatory responsibilities.

It is not clear when the administration intends to announce the nominations, according to the people, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential conversations. Until that happens, it remains possible that Mr. Trump could decide to reopen the search process. Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend did not return calls requesting comment. ""We have no announcement at this time,"" said Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman. Mr. Quarles, 59, is a managing director at the Cynosure Group, a private equity firm based in Salt Lake City. His wife's great-uncle is Marriner Eccles, the Fed's chairman from 1934 to 1948 and the namesake of the Fed's marble headquarters on the National Mall in Washington, where Mr. Quarles would have an office. Mr. Quarles was a lawyer for the financial industry before joining the Bush administration in 2002, first as assistant secretary for international affairs and then as under secretary for domestic finance. After leaving the administration in 2006, he became a partner at the Carlyle Group before helping to found Cynosure in 2014. At the Fed, Mr. Quarles would take the place of Daniel Tarullo, who led the Fed's push to tighten financial regulation after the 2008 crisis, though he was never formally nominated to serve as the vice chairman for supervision.

Mr. Quarles is regarded as significantly more sympathetic than Mr. Tarullo to the industry's concerns that regulation is overly restrictive, limiting economic growth. In a 2015 interview with Bloomberg Television, he said some postcrisis changes in regulation ""aren't well designed and were included for political rather than financial-regulatory reasons."" In a 2016 opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Quarles argued that it was misguided to focus on the size of the largest banks. One of Mr. Quarles's major tasks at the Fed would be overseeing the annual ""stress test"" of large banks, intended to make sure that they can weather a crisis. But his influence would be constrained, at least in the short term, because Ms. Yellen played a key role in developing those regulations. Ms. Yellen's term ends in February 2018, creating the next Fed personnel decision confronting Mr. Trump. Mr. Goodfriend, 66, is a leading figure among conservative economists who study monetary policy. He worked for more than 20 years as an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond; for more than half of that time, he was the chief monetary policy adviser to the bank's president, a member of the Fed's policy committee. He left the bank in 2005 to join the faculty at Carnegie Mellon University. Mr. Quarles and Mr. Goodfriend have expressed support for the idea that the Federal Reserve should adopt a more formulaic approach to policy-making. House Republicans have proposed legislation that would require the Fed to articulate a policy rule -- a mathematical approach to determining the level of interest rates -- that would limit the role of human judgment in monetary policy. ""If you're going to be transparent in an activity like the Fed, you have to be much more rule-based in what you're doing,"" Mr. Quarles told Bloomberg Television in 2015. He described the Fed's current approach as ""a crazy way to run a railroad.""

Mr. Goodfriend endorsed that approach in March testimony before the House Financial Services Committee. He said adopting such a rule was necessary ""to improve the discipline"" of monetary policy and constrain inflation. Mr. Goodfriend is also a critic of the Fed's asset purchases in the wake of the financial crisis. The Fed amassed more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Mr. Goodfriend has said that the Fed should not purchase mortgage bonds, because doing so promotes economic growth in a particular sector -- the kind of judgment that should be left to those who determine fiscal policy. The Fed has operated in recent years without a full complement of seven governors. The board oversees regulatory policy, and the governors also hold permanent votes on the 12-member Federal Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy. By law, the Fed's board must include at least one person with community banking experience, and two of the people with direct knowledge of the process said that a number of candidates with that background have been interviewed in recent weeks. It is not clear, however, where a decision on filling the community-banking governor opening now stands.","Randal K. Quarles and Marvin Goodfriend, conservatives who could counter the influence of Janet Yellen, are expected to be two of the new governors.",3ede2364-acda-5124-8ae3-3e140d0e72e7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/02/us/02fed/02fed-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b1a191165cab28bb0a9b045732042d1b33ec04e94850d86cc199b5b138779e9f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Marriner S.

Opinion,An Obituary for an Extraordinary Ordinary Man,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/opinion/coronavirus-nyc-cesar-quirumbay.html,"Cesar Quirumbay, who succumbed to Covid-19 on Monday morning at the age of 60, touched the lives of some of America's most prominent actors, billionaires and businessmen. Yet very few people blessed by his touch ever knew his name. For the past 20 years, Mr. Quirumbay worked at the New York tailoring shop owned by Leonard Logsdail, a London transplant who has made custom suits for people willing and able to pay $8,000 for a handmade jacket and pair of trousers since 1991. Mr. Logsdail's midtown shop is a leisurely place, with leather club chairs and stacks of magazines and soft fabrics arranged in gentle disarray. In the back, Mr. Quirumbay -- I knew him only as Cesar -- worked tirelessly, sewing and measuring and pressing, rarely speaking and never complaining about the heat of the iron or the coolness of some of the shop's more demanding customers. He put the finishing touches on suits for Al Pacino, Leonardo DiCaprio, David Koch, Larry Kudlow and countless managing directors, doctors and dandies. It was Mr. Quirumbay's hands that were the last to touch each garment that left Logsdail's. Mr. Quirumbay immigrated to New Jersey in 1998 and showed up at Logsdail's door in Manhattan within days of his arrival to inquire about a job. He and his wife, Irma, had left their two young boys back home in Ecuador and wanted first to secure employment before attempting to reunite their family. A friend of Mr. Quirumbay who worked in the trade suggested that Mr. Logsdail might be hiring.

When Mr. Logsdail asked Mr. Quirumbay what sort of tailoring he was capable of, he expected to hear the usual puffery he so often heard from prospective hires. But Mr. Quirumbay was made of different stuff. ""I do alterations only,"" he replied, and his honesty won him a spot on Mr. Logsdail's team. The world of high-end bespoke clothing places extraordinary demands on a tailor; a jacket can take upward of 30 hours to create. For a lapel to roll perfectly, no fewer than 300 hand stitches are required. But Mr. Quirumbay grew into his role. ""There was something special about Cesar,"" Mr. Logsdail told me. ""He was artistic in his DNA. It's not just about stitching things together. It's about stitching things together properly. With a lot of tailors, there's sometimes a sense of 'that'll do,' which is a terrible attitude to have, because it will not do. I never had to talk to him about his work."" And Mr. Quirumbay worked a lot, from 7 a.m. to 6:30 p.m., five days a week, and on Saturdays, too, from 8 until 2. When a deadline shifted at the last minute and a suit needed to be produced for Russell Crowe to wear for a shoot the next morning in Brooklyn, he worked 23 hours straight to ensure that the costume was finished, pressed and ready by sunrise. Then there was the time that Mr. Quirumbay and his fellow tailor Ki Soo Jeong, a Korean immigrant, spent a weekend trying to make a suit and a bomber jacket out of a single sheet of purple plastic for Ben Stiller to wear in ""Zoolander 2."" Mr. Quirumbay didn't speak Korean, Mr. Ki doesn't speak Spanish, and neither of them really mastered English. But despite all that -- and though the iron kept melting the plastic -- they pulled it off. The duo made an impressive team and were constantly cracking each other up with jokes that were unintelligible to any outsider. Mr. Logsdail said it was as if they invented their own language.

What motivated Mr. Quirumbay weren't the vistas his job afforded him into the world of celebrity. It was the fact that by his labor he was providing for his wife and five children. Mr. Quirumbay believed in what the United States had to offer an immigrant like him. The two sons he had left behind in Ecuador were brought to the United States just a few months after he started working at Logsdail's. They grew up in New Jersey and joined the military, one the Army, the other the Marines. The Quirumbays went on to have three more children -- two daughters, both of whom now have children of their own, and another son, now in college. Along the way, Mr. Quirumbay and his wife became American citizens and bought a house. ""Everything he obtained he worked for,"" Mr. Logsdail wrote on Instagram. ""As I said, the embodiment of the American dream."" Every obituary is both a remembrance of a life ended and an instruction to those of us still living. Mr. Quirumbay wasn't just another 60-year-old who succumbed to a pandemic; he was one of the many excellent Americans whose spirit and labor make this country possible, even -- or particularly -- in times of crisis. Before Mr. Quirumbay passed away, he shared a last phone call with his son. ""Make sure you call Mr. Logsdail so he knows I can't work and where I am at,"" Mr. Quirumbay said from his deathbed. ""There is a lot to be done."" Matthew Miller works in real estate in New York City. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor.

Travel,"Chicago Man Fraudulently Accrued 42 Million Delta SkyBonus Points, U.S. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/13/travel/delta-skybonus-fraud.html,"Where would you go if you had more than 40 million points with an airline? Hawaii 96 times? Seoul 40 times? Federal District Court in Atlanta?

Gennady Podolsky, a travel agent based in Chicago, was charged on Wednesday with 12 counts of wire fraud in connection with what prosecutors describe as a 13-month scheme in which he accrued 42 million Delta SkyBonus points, valued at more than $1.75 million .

SkyBonus points are earned through a corporate loyalty program through which companies can accrue points that can be redeemed for free flights and rewards from the airline. According to the indictment, filed on Wednesday in United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia , Mr. Podolsky created a SkyBonus account for a corporation called RGI International with which he is not affiliated.

Mr. Podolsky, 43, would link flights that he booked for clients of Vega International Travel Services, where he worked as a travel agent, to RGI International's SkyBonus account, allowing him to ""fraudulently accrue"" points, the indictment said.","Gennady Podolsky used his position as a travel agent to cheat Delta Air Lines out of $1.75 million worth of loyalty points, according to an indictment.",2fff3b98-b84c-5ff4-9f17-063f4f0796d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/14/multimedia/13xp-skymiles-print/13xp-skymiles-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=96beaa1378f548042c52706329837337d7457930350d2b547385d1fbe9a3250c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Delta said on Friday that it was &ldquo;happy to see any kind of fraud indicted&rdquo; and would &ldquo;continue to work with the F.B.I.&rdquo;,2fff3b98-b84c-5ff4-9f17-063f4f0796d7,N24News/imgs/2fff3b98-b84c-5ff4-9f17-063f4f0796d7.jpg,4
Travel,"Young, Confident and Flying, Virus Be Damned",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/travel/coronavirus-travel-deals.html,"As people self-quarantine, work from home and generally wall themselves off from the outside world, Joe DeSimone is preparing to travel the globe. In the last few weeks, the 30-year-old game design instructor from Austin, Texas, has booked two flights -- to London and Toronto -- and has getaways to Nashville and Los Angeles in the works. He's one of a number of young people who have watched airline ticket prices plunge in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak, and have seen it as their golden opportunity to travel. ""The way I see it,"" Mr. DeSimone said, ""either things will normalize and prices will return to a rate that makes it difficult for me to travel, or the world is going to end and I might as well enjoy it while it lasts.""

Raj Mahal, 32, runs PlanMoreTrips, an online travel planning app he launched in January. For the last month, as the number of coronavirus cases ticked up, activity on his site declined. But then, nearly overnight, he saw a 20 percent jump in bookings -- largely from people flying out of tech hubs like San Francisco, Seattle and New York -- to warmer locations like Hawaii, Australia and South America. Curious about the trend, he emailed customers to ask them why they were booking. He learned that many were employees of large tech companies like Uber, Twitter, Amazon and Google, who had been given instructions to work remotely. ""A bunch of them were saying, well, the coronavirus is here in my city, so we may as well go somewhere else,"" Mr. Mahal said. ""We've even seen co-workers booking together. They figure if we have to work from home, we might as well go rent a house in Hawaii."" To tap into this new market, Mr. Mahal made a ""coronavirus flight alert,"" a program that aggregates cheap flights and emails users suggested itineraries. ""If you're comfortable with the risk, the prices are like the cheapest they've been in 10 years,"" Mr. Mahal said. ""Flights are cheap, lodging is cheap, there are no tourists.""

Traveling during the pandemic flies in the face of expert advice and government advisories. Travelers who are infected, even if they are not showing symptoms, may transport and spread the virus to a new location, or contaminate an airplane, cab or Airbnb. While they may be healthy enough to survive the virus, they could be putting others at risk. They could also get infected during their travels, and have to be hospitalized during a trip, or get quarantined somewhere far from home. But for people like Mr. DeSimone, the risks can feel very abstract, while the deals are quite concrete. ""As far as I can tell, the mortality rate is like sub one percent for people who aren't elderly,"" said Mr. DeSimone, who added that he's willing to risk infection for his cheap international trips. ""Odds are, if I get sick, it will be like a bad flu."" On Wednesday, he saw a round-trip flight from Austin to Los Angeles for $50. ""I spend more than 50 bucks on cigarettes and coffee in a weekend,"" he said, ""so like, why not?"" Some argue that these travelers may be a shot in the arm for the travel industry, buying tickets at a time where carriers are flying near empty planes and filling Airbnbs and hotels as people stop taking trips.","For some people, a $50 plane ticket is too good a deal to pass up, even during a pandemic.",5e78391e-6c96-5d88-89a3-d8edda7c163b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/13/travel/13-virus-travel-deals/merlin_94505663_56e62899-dfc0-4ed5-af6c-d83ce4847829-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6dbd37987eb0982251a1a6bc08a921ce9854ea8924ee5b07216763933be647c9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"If you have to work remotely, why not do it in Hawaii?

Fashion & Style,It Was Love at First Follow,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/fashion/weddings/it-was-love-at-first-follow.html,"Dr. Sharath Puttichanda was an emergency-medicine psychiatrist at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence in December 2019 when he stumbled across Sundeep Dosanjh's Instagram posts from Machu Picchu. A neighbor was off on an adventure in Peru while he was stuck home in wintry New England, Dr. Puttichanda (left) said, so he began wandering on the internet. ""I was jealous,"" he said. Mr. Dosanjh's Instagram posts were loaded with hashtags that included #gayindian. There he found more than just vicarious travel adventures. ""He had this beautiful post about his coming-out story,"" said Dr. Puttichanda, 38 and the assistant director for psychiatric emergency services at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. ""I read that and I remember telling two of my best friends, 'There's this guy, and he had this beautiful story, and there's something so familiar about him that I feel the need to reach out.'""

He didn't. Instead, he began following Mr. Dosanjh, 36, on Instagram. So a few weeks later, when Mr. Dosanjh posted a story about a Lyft driver's off-handed, offensive remark about his ethnicity, Dr. Puttichanda posted a fiery comment noting that he also had had similar experiences. ""I responded, then looked at his pictures,"" said Mr. Dosanjh, a web and communications specialist for the school district in Elk Grove, Calif. ""He's cute, and I followed him back, and we started bantering."" Dr. Puttichanda had a break coming up, and Mr. Dosanjh suggested that he take a red-eye to San Francisco, so that the two might meet. But Dr. Puttichanda had tickets to a Broadway show, so, instead, he all but brought Mr. Dosanjh along on his trip to New York, via FaceTime. He narrated every event, and the two were still on FaceTime together until both fell asleep.

""I said, 'I don't know what's going on between you and I, but I have to let you know that I can't leave Northern California,'"" he said. ""He was like, 'OK. I have nothing holding me back.' And my heart literally melted."" The first actual meeting between the two was still more than a month in their future. With 3,000 miles separating them, they had to be creative about ""dates."" For their first, each went to a local P.F. Chang's, and fired up FaceTime to experience dinner almost as if they were in the same place. ""We had first-date conversation, looked at the menu together, everything you would do on a real in-person date,"" Mr. Dosanjh said. ""We had to think out every single detail to make it work."" They had a second virtual date at the Cheesecake Factory shortly afterward. Mr. Dosanjh sent flowers to Dr. Puttichanda for Valentine's Day. At the end of February, Dr. Puttichanda flew to San Francisco for an 11-day holiday, and Mr. Dosanjh surprised him at the baggage carousel. ""We kissed,"" Dr. Puttichanda said, ""and in that moment, I let everything go."" The two were married Sept. 25, in a wedding that began with a Sikh Punjabi ceremony at the Sheldon Inn, a restaurant in Elk Grove, Calif. Jasminder Singh, a cousin of Mr. Dosanjh who became a Universal Life minister for the event, oversaw the signing of the civil marriage license.","Instagram brought them together but a continent separated them, so Dr. Sharath Puttichanda and Sundeep Dosanjh fell in love well before they met in person.",d15d30f2-fcbe-527a-b54a-b5d8760c7b56,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/fashion/weddings/04dosanjh-puttichanda1/oakImage-1601399331195-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=047277481247835cfb30102519a6b47d2cc25d0dad93f7ce94cfa03717c55d45&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sharath Puttichanda, left, and Sundeep Dosanjh.",d15d30f2-fcbe-527a-b54a-b5d8760c7b56,N24News/imgs/d15d30f2-fcbe-527a-b54a-b5d8760c7b56.jpg,19
Movies,"Oscar Nominations 2019: 'Roma,' 'The Favourite' and 'Black Panther' Break Ground",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/movies/oscar-nominations-academy-awards.html,"After years of aggressive maneuvering, the streaming service received its first-ever nomination for best picture on Tuesday, with Oscar voters naming ""Roma"" as one of the best movies of 2018. The meditative black-and-white film about life in Mexico in the 1970s -- which officially has North American ticket sales of zero, since Netflix does not release its films in a traditional manner -- amassed 10 nominations over all, including for Alfonso Cuaron's direction, cinematography and original screenplay. [""If Beale Street Could Talk"" received three nominations. Here's what's on the director Barry Jenkins's mind.] Yalitza Aparicio, who plays the lead role in ""Roma,"" received a best actress nomination, a rare recognition for an Indigenous woman that also gives the film a high-profile presence in the acting races, a crucial part of collecting the votes needed for a best picture win. Voters even found a spot for Marina de Tavira as supporting actress.

The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences allows the best picture category to have as many as 10 or as few as five nominees, depending on how the organization's 8,200 voting members spread their support. This time around, eight movies were nominated, down from nine from last year. Rounding out the category were idiosyncratic indies (""The Favourite,"" ""Vice""), studio crowd-pleasers (""Black Panther,"" ""A Star Is Born,"" ""Bohemian Rhapsody"") and films about racism in America (""BlacKkKlansman,"" ""Green Book""). Compared with years past, when academy voters came under repeated #OscarsSoWhite attack for failing to nominate films that focused on black characters, the best picture selections were remarkably diverse. Besides the foreign-language ""Roma,"" there was ""Black Panther,"" which celebrates black culture. Gay rights groups have praised ""The Favourite"" for its depiction of a lesbian love triangle. ""A Star Is Born"" is about a woman on the rise. ""I can't remember a time when best picture had such diversity across the board,"" said David Linde, the chief executive of Participant Media, which helped produce ""Roma"" and ""Green Book."" Participant, which focuses on social causes, was also a force behind ""RBG,"" about Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Supreme Court justice, which received a nomination for best documentary. ""We make these movies for a reason -- they lead to conversations that are important -- and it's great to see the academy membership taking them so seriously,"" Mr. Linde added. [See the complete list of Oscar nominees.] Even so, the acting categories were less inclusive, with one black actor and one black actress among the 20 nominees. ""Crazy Rich Asians"" was overlooked completely. All of the directing, cinematography, editing and original score nominees were men. ""We must do better,"" the actress Amber Tamblyn wrote on Twitter.

Speaking by phone from a London editing room, Lanthimos said he was pleased that voters recognized all three actresses at the center of ""The Favourite."" ""That has been my whole goal from the beginning -- three very strong women, without one separated out,"" he said. ""The fact that most of my collaborators got recognized is what I'm most proud about."" For someone whose film had just been thrust to the front of the Oscar race, Lanthimos sounded strangely composed. ""I'm calm because I'm working,"" he said. ""You have to stay focused. I'll celebrate tonight."" Unlike last year, when the list of nominations revealed ""The Shape of Water"" as the clear Oscar front-runner, the current race is still very much a race. Don't count out Spike Lee's ""BlacKkKlansman,"" the true story of a black police officer who infiltrated the Ku Klux Klan in the 1970s. For the first time in his 40-year career, Lee received a nomination for best director, joining Cuaron, Lanthimos, Adam McKay (""Vice"") and Pawel Pawlikowski (""Cold War""). ""BlacKkKlansman"" got six nominations in total, including for Adam Driver's acting in a supporting role and Terence Blanchard's score.

""Black Panther"" received seven, making its strongest mark in music: song, score, sound editing and sound mixing. Hannah Beachler, honored for her ""Black Panther"" production design, became the first African-American to break into that category. The best actress contest is unusually competitive. Glenn Close received her seventh Oscar nomination -- she has never won -- for playing the title role in ""The Wife,"" a Sony Pictures Classics film about a woman who sacrifices her professional ambitions. Close, who won a Globe for the performance, will be vying against the first-time nominees Aparicio, Gaga and Colman, also a Globe winner. Melissa McCarthy (""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"") drew the fifth slot. Among the actors, Cooper will compete against Christian Bale, who transformed himself into a paunchy Cheney in ""Vice,"" and Rami Malek, who morphed into a toothy Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody."" Also nominated were Willem Dafoe (""At Eternity's Gate"") and Viggo Mortensen (""Green Book"").

""Green Book,"" adored by many for its feel-good depiction of interracial friendship and disliked by others for its reliance on racial cliches, garnered five nominations, including editing and original screenplay. Although ""Green Book"" did not receive as much attention as expected -- Peter Farrelly was snubbed as a director nominee -- voters seemed generally unfazed by the ongoing brouhahas around the film, including the resurfacing of an anti-Muslim tweet by Nick Vallelonga, one of the film's screenwriters. (He apologized.) ""Green Book"" also won the predictive top prize at the Producers Guild of America awards over the weekend. [""A Star Is Born"" falls short of expectations, and Netflix makes history. Read about this year's snubs and surprises.]

Perhaps fittingly in such a scattershot year, the ceremony itself is shaping up as a mystery. No host has been named; the academy's first choice, Kevin Hart, dropped out after (initially) refusing to apologize for past anti-gay ramblings on Twitter. It is also unclear how the 91st Academy Awards, scheduled for Feb. 24, will handle a major change in its format: To keep the show to three hours, up to eight categories will be moved to commercial breaks, with the winning moments edited and aired later in the telecast. The academy has not said which categories (there are 24 total) will be jettisoned from the live show. The academy's leaders -- with urging from ABC, which broadcasts the ceremony -- decided to take such drastic action because viewership has been plummeting. A record low of 26.5 million people watched last year's telecast, a nearly 20 percent drop from a year earlier. As recently as four years ago, the Academy Awards had an audience of nearly 44 million viewers. Another effort to attract more viewers, the creation of an Oscar for ""outstanding achievement in popular film,"" was abandoned by the academy in September. The academy was trying to make room for blockbusters, which voters have increasingly tended to ignore in favor of little-seen art films. But this year ended up as an exception: ""Black Panther,"" with $1.35 billion in global ticket sales, was the No. 1 movie of 2018. It is the first superhero movie nominated for best picture. ""A Star Is Born"" collected $409 million, an astounding total for a drama. In some ways, Oscar voters appeared to be saying that Hollywood has room for both the future (Netflix, which also secured three nods for ""The Ballad of Buster Scruggs"") and the past (classic studio stories like ""A Star Is Born,"" which is the fourth version of that film to receive nominations). The academy's old guard had resisted an aggressive push by Netflix to join the best picture club, arguing that, since the streaming service does not release its films in a traditional theatrical manner, its offerings should be better considered by Emmy voters. ""Roma"" has played in a smattering of theaters in North America, but major chains have refused to show it because Netflix made it available online in short order. AMC and Regal said on Tuesday that they would not include ""Roma"" in their annual showcases of best picture nominees. Netflix has relentlessly campaigned for Oscars, though, making inroads first with documentaries and then, last year, with ""Mudbound,"" which missed a best picture nomination but received attention in other prominent categories.","Netflix got its first best picture nod.

Media,Leader Who Rebuilt Time Warner Empire Prepares an Exit,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/23/business/media/time-warner-jeffrey-bewkes-cnn.html,"Jeffrey L. Bewkes championed acclaimed series like ""The Sopranos"" and ""Sex and the City"" at HBO, salvaged Time Warner from its disastrous merger with AOL and publicly battled his rival media mogul Rupert Murdoch three years ago to fend off a hostile takeover. Since Mr. Bewkes took over as chief executive in 2008, Time Warner has delivered the highest stock market returns of the big media conglomerates. Now, after a 38-year career at Time Warner during which he shaped it into one of the most formidable media companies of its day, he is preparing for his final act. If regulators approve AT&T's $85.4 billion bid for Time Warner, two major changes are expected: Mr. Bewkes plans to leave as chief executive following a transition period, and the Time Warner name is likely to be eliminated, as AT&T subsumes the company's assets: HBO, the Turner cable network brands and the Warner Bros. film and television studios. It would all make for a smooth, perhaps even glamorous exit for Mr. Bewkes, and certainly a lucrative one, given that he stands to earn as much as $95 million if the merger is completed and he leaves the company. But there is one big storm cloud hovering over the deal: the Trump White House.

Analysts have said the merger faces no legitimate hurdles on its way to approval by the Justice Department's Antitrust Division. But President Trump's blistering attacks in recent weeks against CNN, Time Warner's cable news network, have raised the possibility that the administration will try to influence the decision. White House advisers have discussed using the pending merger as a potential point of leverage over CNN, a senior administration official told The New York Times this month. In his understated manner, Mr. Bewkes said he was not worried about the White House interfering in the deal. ""I know people say things like that,"" he said in an interview last week. ""I don't think it is true."" Mr. Bewkes said that the review of the proposed merger was an antitrust analysis of whether the combination would enhance or harm competition, and that Time Warner's programming -- including CNN's aggressive reporting on Mr. Trump -- was not relevant. Still, Mr. Trump's hostility toward CNN has thrust the network into the spotlight as the review of the deal continues. The issue of CNN's editorial independence arose late last month at a dinner Mr. Bewkes attended with AT&T board members in Dallas. As Mr. Bewkes was providing a rundown of Time Warner's divisions, he said, he was asked about CNN, which had just made news by retracting a story about Anthony Scaramucci, a Trump confidant who is now the president's communications director. Three journalists who worked on the story were ultimately forced to resign. He defended that decision, and told board members the network's independence was ""sacred.""

If Time Warner is folded into AT&T, it will mark the end of an era, for both an executive who rose through the corporate ranks after starting as an HBO staff member in 1979 -- using a stack of boxes as a desk -- and a media conglomerate. Over the past century, dating to its roots in Time Inc., the company ushered in a series of innovations, including the first talking feature film, the first premium cable network, the first 24-hour news network and, on Mr. Bewkes's watch, a push toward video-on-demand and other digital offerings. ""It is the legacy that I have been the steward of,"" Mr. Bewkes, 65, said. ""That is why we thought, 'We have got to do the next step.'"" In an industry filled with larger-than-life executives, driven to expand their empires, Mr. Bewkes developed a reputation as a cerebral, private figure with a dry sense of humor, who was focused on creating value for investors. He did so by spinning off Time Warner Cable in 2009, AOL the same year and the Time Inc. magazine division in 2014. What was left was a focused TV and film company. Mr. Bewkes invested in ambitious programming, including original series on HBO like ""Game of Thrones,"" sports deals like the N.C.A.A. basketball tournament and big bets on major film franchises like the ""Harry Potter"" movies and the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. He also pushed toward a streaming future, evangelizing his ""TV Everywhere"" video-on-demand initiative and creating HBO's stand-alone streaming service. As a result, Time Warner was positioned as an attractive takeover target. Mr. Bewkes's success can be attributed to ""being very, very rational in his decision making and, on the other hand, having a real flair for the creative,"" said Michael Lynton, a longtime media executive who was at Time Warner when it merged with AOL. ""That is a rare combination.""
* Stocks rise after President Biden says Jerome Powell will stay atop the Fed.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business. There is no question that Mr. Bewkes has delivered value to shareholders. A $1,000 investment in Time Warner stock when he became chief executive in 2008 would be worth about $4,400 today.

Should the deal with AT&T be completed, attention will turn to Time Warner's properties as new corporate owners try to manage a business that sometimes brings controversy. Mr. Bewkes said that the heads of Turner, Warner Bros. and HBO -- all of whom had been viewed as candidates to succeed him -- are expected to continue in their roles. The job of managing those assets, now Mr. Bewkes's role, is expected to be assumed by John Stankey, the chief executive of AT&T's entertainment group. AT&T's priority, Mr. Bewkes said, will be to find new ways to present programming to audiences. ""I don't believe they think their focus is about what to do about HBO's programming schedule or how to mess around with the Warner show slate,"" he added. CNN, however, is expected to draw extra scrutiny. Mr. Trump's criticism has focused attention not just on the network but on its embattled president, Jeffrey A. Zucker, whom Mr. Trump believes has been disloyal to him. And CNN has put itself on the defensive with damaging missteps, including the retracted story last month. That issue arose at the dinner last month in Dallas with AT&T board members. When the discussion turned to CNN, Mr. Bewkes said, he supported Mr. Zucker's handling of the retracted story. He argued that CNN was a successful and growing business, citing its global news operations and its push toward mobile platforms. CNN brings in more than $1 billion a year in profit.

""It is a huge achievement of the whole company under Jeff's leadership,"" Mr. Bewkes said in the interview. In recent weeks, Mr. Trump has ratcheted up his attacks on CNN. He also stated publicly, without evidence, that management changes could be coming to the network. Asked for his reaction to comments by the president -- especially those attacking CNN -- Mr. Bewkes said that he did not think they were relevant to how the network covered news or the review of the proposed deal between AT&T and Time Warner. ""I think statements out of high political office ought to be considered statements,"" he said. Mr. Bewkes said Mr. Zucker continued to have the support of Time Warner management. ""We have always been a public-trust journalism company,"" Mr. Bewkes said in the interview. ""We have all kinds of critics that say we failed.'' He alluded to CNN's having been criticized during the campaign for its extensive coverage of Mr. Trump and being attacked by Mr. Trump for coverage he deemed unfair. ""We either elected the president by giving him airtime -- when in fact nobody else would come,'' he said, ""or we have been trying to not elect him by doing something with an agenda, which I hope isn't the case."" So far, there is no clear indication of how AT&T might manage CNN. Shortly after the deal was announced, Randall Stephenson, AT&T's chief executive, declared that CNN was ""an American symbol of independent journalism"" and said later ""the last thing we want'' was to taint its independence.

As he prepared to move on, Mr. Bewkes said he had few regrets. The $850 million acquisition of the social networking site Bebo was a flop, he acknowledged. And he said the company should have bought Netflix in its early years and taken full control of Comedy Central when it had the chance. But he noted that Time Warner networks have recruited several stars from Comedy Central, including Jon Stewart and John Oliver on HBO and Samantha Bee on TBS, although Mr. Stewart's first HBO project did not pan out. Mr. Bewkes jokingly lamented the decision to allow Time Warner Cable to hold on to the Time Warner name, which has led cable customers to call him with complaints about their service. (He said he still received about 10 a day.) Mr. Bewkes said he was focused for the moment on closing the deal with AT&T and, until then, continuing to manage Time Warner. He said he was not sure what he would do next. ""If I was following the crowd, I guess I would just run for president like everybody else,"" he joked, before adding that at 65 he was not in a rush to take on another job like his current one. ""How could you do something like this, after this?"" he asked. ""This is great.""","Jeffrey Bewkes, a quiet defender of CNN who has delivered Time Warner high returns, plans to leave the company if a merger with AT&T is approved.",f6eb04ea-a185-5198-bd47-3ccb46bf5e2d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/24/business/24timewarner/24timewarner-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ea25275b5b583fba115d9ee63921fdec5c0cb838c8f62745a4366211208ebf53&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jeffrey Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, center right, at an event in Manhattan in July.",f6eb04ea-a185-5198-bd47-3ccb46bf5e2d,N24News/imgs/f6eb04ea-a185-5198-bd47-3ccb46bf5e2d.jpg,16
Sports,What We Learned From Week 10 of the N.F.L. Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/15/sports/football/nfl-results.html,"* None DeAndre Hopkins is magic. Buffalo had just scored a gut-punch of a touchdown to take a 30-26 lead in the final minute of the fourth quarter and Arizona, after the ensuing kickoff, had just 34 seconds to go 75 yards to score a winning touchdown. Undeterred, Kyler Murray and the Cardinals were methodical. Murray, the second-year quarterback. completed passes of 14, 9 and 9 yards to put Arizona at Buffalo's 43-yard line, and that was all the space he needed. On his fourth pass of the drive, Murray launched a Hail Mary into triple-coverage in the end zone and Hopkins, acquired in a trade this off-season to unlock Murray's potential, managed to outjump and outmuscle all three Buffalo defenders for the ball. The remarkable catch is the type of highlight that will be replayed for years, and it gave Arizona a thrilling end to a 32-30 win. Thanks to a Seattle loss to the Rams, it also gave the Cardinals a share of the division lead in the ultracompetitive N.F.C. West.
* None Ronald Jones II had a point to prove. After Tampa Bay set an N.F.L. record by running the ball just five times in a humiliating loss to New Orleans last week, the Buccaneers remembered Jones existed and the running back helped carry them to a laughable 46-23 win over Carolina. Jones ran for 192 yards on 23 carries, but one play stood out above the rest. In the third quarter, with Tampa Bay clinging to a 3-point lead, Jones took a handoff at his team's 2-yard line, sliced right through a pack of Carolina defenders, and raced 98 yards for a touchdown, securing just the fourth rushing touchdown of 98 or more yards in N.F.L. history, according to Pro Football Reference. According to the N.F.L.'s Next Gen Stats database, Jones hit 21.19 miles per hour on the run, gaining 94 more yards than expected on the play -- the highest mark in that statistic all season.

It is hard to tell by the final score, but this was a closely-contested 17-17 game at halftime, and the second half had a slow start as well. Jones's wild 98-yard run came on the first play of Tampa Bay's second drive of the third quarter, and from there the Buccaneers were off to the races. Needless to say, the 192 yards rushing were a personal best for Jones, who came into the day with a career-high of 113. He had just 9 last week.

Detroit's Matt Prater got most of the attention for a three field-goal game that included a 59-yard game-winner as time expired, but he was far from alone. With one game remaining in Week 10, the league's kickers have already connected for 11 field goals of 50 or more yards, tying a record set in Week 13 of the 2012 season. The longest field goal on Sunday belonged to Seattle's Jason Myers, who hit a 61-yarder in the Seahawks' loss to Los Angeles. But the best day, beyond Prater's, belonged to Buffalo's Tyler Bass who connected on field goals of 54, 55 and 58 yards, setting a new career long on three consecutive kicks.

Cardinals 32, Bills 30 The photo above this item is of a Cardinals touchdown. Buccaneers 46, Panthers 23 Tom Brady had more than 300 yards passing for the third time this season -- he topped that mark only once in his final 10 games with New England -- and he once again split up his touchdown passes, with one each to Rob Gronkowski, Mike Evans and Cameron Brate. Steelers 36, Bengals 10 Pittsburgh's big day on offense saw Diontae Johnson, a second-year wide receiver, contribute six catches for 116 yards and a touchdown while the rookie sensation Chase Claypool scored two more touchdowns, bringing his total over his last six games to eight.

Browns 10, Texans 7 In his first action since Week 4, Nick Chubb ran for 126 yards and a touchdown while Kareem Hunt, seeming happy to share the load, had 132 yards from scrimmage. Lions 30, Footballers 27 In his first start in nearly two years following a devastating leg break, Alex Smith threw for 390 yards and rallied his team all the way back from a 24-3 deficit to a 27-27 tie before a mistake by his team's defense handed Detroit the victory. Raiders 37, Broncos 12 When asked about a game in which his team's defense forced five turnovers and running backs Josh Jacobs and Devontae Booker combined for 193 yards rushing and four touchdowns, quarterback Derek Carr just seemed happy to be there.

Science,"Ancestors of Modern Humans Interbred With Extinct Hominins, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/science/neanderthals-interbred-with-humans-denisovans.html,"The ancestors of modern humans interbred with Neanderthals and another extinct line of humans known as the Denisovans at least four times in the course of prehistory, according to an analysis of global genomes published Thursday in the journal Science. The interbreeding may have given modern humans genes that bolstered immunity to pathogens, the authors concluded. ""This is yet another genetic nail in the coffin of our oversimplistic models of human evolution,"" said Carles Lalueza-Fox, a research scientist at the Institute of Evolutionary Biology in Barcelona, Spain, who was not involved in the study. The new study expands on a series of findings in recent years showing that the ancestors of modern humans once shared the planet with a surprising number of near relatives -- lineages like the Neanderthals and Denisovans that became extinct tens of thousands of years ago.

Before disappearing, however, they interbred with our forebears on at least several occasions. Today, we carry DNA from these encounters. The first clues to ancient interbreeding surfaced in 2010, when scientists discovered that some modern humans -- mostly Europeans -- carried DNA that matched material recovered from Neanderthal fossils. Later studies showed that the forebears of modern humans first encountered Neanderthals after expanding out of Africa more than 50,000 years ago. But the Neanderthals were not the only extinct humans that our own ancestors found. A finger bone discovered in a Siberian cave, called Denisova, yielded DNA from yet another group of humans.

Research later indicated that all three groups -- modern humans, Neanderthals and Denisovans -- shared a common ancestor who lived roughly 600,000 years ago. And, perhaps no surprise, some ancestors of modern humans also interbred with Denisovans. Some of their DNA has survived in people in Melanesia, a region of the Pacific that includes New Guinea and the islands around it. Those initial discoveries left major questions unanswered, such as how often our ancestors interbred with Neanderthals and Denisovans. Scientists have developed new ways to study the DNA of living people to tackle these mysteries. Joshua M. Akey, a geneticist at the University of Washington, and his colleagues analyzed a database of 1,488 genomes from people around the world. The scientists added 35 genomes from people in New Britain and other Melanesian islands in an effort to learn more about Denisovans in particular. The researchers found that all of the non-Africans in their study had Neanderthal DNA, while the Africans had very little or none. That finding supported previous studies. But when Dr. Akey and his colleagues compared DNA from modern Europeans, East Asians and Melanesians, they found that each population carried its own distinctive mix of Neanderthal genes. The best explanation for these patterns, the scientists concluded, was that the ancestors of modern humans acquired Neanderthal DNA on three occasions.

The first encounter happened when the common ancestor of all non-Africans interbred with Neanderthals. The second occurred among the ancestors of East Asians and Europeans, after the ancestors of Melanesians split off. Later, the ancestors of East Asians -- but not Europeans -- interbred a third time with Neanderthals. Earlier studies had hinted at the possibility that the forebears of modern humans had multiple encounters with Neanderthals, but hard data had been lacking. ""A lot of people have been arguing for that, but now they're really providing the evidence for it,"" said Rasmus Nielsen, a geneticist at the University of California, Berkeley, who was not involved in the new study.

The Melanesians took a different course. After a single interbreeding with Neanderthals, Dr. Akey found, their ancestors went on to interbreed just once with Denisovans as well. Where that encounter could have taken place remains an enigma. The only place Denisovan remains have been found is Siberia, a long way from New Guinea.

It is possible that Denisovans ranged down to Southeast Asia, Dr. Akey said, crossing paths with modern humans who later settled in Melanesia. Dr. Akey and his colleagues also identified some regions of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA that became more common in modern humans as generations passed, suggesting that they provided some kind of a survival advantage. Many of the regions contain immune system genes, Dr. Akey noted. ""As modern humans are spreading out across the world, they're encountering pathogens they haven't experienced before,"" he said. Neanderthals and Denisovans may have had genes that were adapted to fight those enemies. ""Maybe they really helped us survive and thrive in these new environments,"" he said. Dr. Akey and his colleagues found that Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA was glaringly absent from four regions of the modern human genome. That absence may signal that these stretches of the genome are instrumental in making modern humans unique. Intriguingly, one of those regions includes a gene called FOXP2, which is involved in speech. Scientists suspect that Neanderthals and Denisovans were not the only extinct races our ancestors interbred with. PingHsun Hsieh, a biologist at the University of Arizona, and his colleagues reported last month that the genomes of African pygmies contained pieces of DNA that came from an unknown source within the last 30,000 years. Dr. Akey and his colleagues are now following up with an analysis of African populations. ""This potentially allows us to find new twigs on the human family tree,"" he said.","The interbreeding may have given modern humans better immunity to pathogens, according to the authors of the analysis of global genomes.",43ca8f09-ef41-511a-bd86-71ab2bd772f8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/18/science/22ZIMMER/22ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=8372e2e85255ef5d48dcd5262cfaf9de96b29b357482146ebb0d15fb07fa3371&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Skulls of the Neanderthal man.,43ca8f09-ef41-511a-bd86-71ab2bd772f8,N24News/imgs/43ca8f09-ef41-511a-bd86-71ab2bd772f8.jpg,2
Economy,Trump Is Off to a Slow Start on Trade Promises,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/business/economy/trump-trade-policy.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump keeps firing verbal broadsides at Mexico and China, but so far his new administration has not acted to keep specific campaign promises about trade policy. Mr. Trump did not declare China a ""currency manipulator"" on his first day in office, as he had vowed, nor has he after his first month. Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, said on Thursday that his department was conducting a standard biannual review of the currency practices of China and other trading partners. Mr. Trump also has not initiated the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement with Mexico and Canada, something he promised to ""immediately pursue."" ""There's definitely a huge gap between rhetoric and reality,"" said Chad P. Bown, a senior fellow and specialist on trade policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics.

Mr. Trump made trade one of his signature issues during the campaign, excoriating what he described as failed policies that have allowed foreign countries, notably China and Mexico, to profit at Americans' expense. And he has not changed his tune since he moved into the White House. ""Take a look at Nafta, one of the worst deals ever made by any country having to do with economic development,"" Mr. Trump told the cheering crowd on Friday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, held just outside Washington. ""It's economic undevelopment, as far as our country is concerned."" Mr. Trump has fulfilled one campaign promise on trade, signing an order to withdraw the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a unsigned deal that the Obama administration negotiated with Pacific Rim nations but had not submitted to Congress for approval. But the absence of clear action on China and Mexico is striking, both because Mr. Trump's language remains so bellicose and because the administration has moved quickly to keep many of the other campaign promises that it made. The ""Contract with the American Voter"" that Mr. Trump announced in October has proved in most respects an accurate guide to the first month of his presidency.

Mr. Trump has nominated a conservative judge to the Supreme Court and announced a freeze on federal hiring. He has reversed some Obama-era regulations and sharply shifted the government's policies on immigration. The White House is pressing Congress to approve a new health care plan and overhaul the tax code. Trade policy has emerged as perhaps the most notable exception. Mr. Trump's views on trade diverge widely from the mainstream of the Republican Party, more so than on any other issue of economic policy. And some Republicans were quick to warn Mr. Trump against protectionist measures, fearing they could damage American economic growth. ""The main point I wanted to convey is that regardless of what action the incoming president takes on trade, he and his advisers should consider the effects on agriculture,"" Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, declared last month after meeting with Robert E. Lighthizer, Mr. Trump's choice to be chief trade negotiator. ""I expect the new administration to work hard to maintain existing markets for Iowa and other farm states' exports and open new markets as well.""

Another farm state Republican, Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, this week celebrated the 200th anniversary of the publication of David Ricardo's economic theory of comparative advantage, which shows that trade between two nations benefits both. ""It's still brilliant & beautiful,"" Mr. Sasse wrote on Twitter. He suggested in a second post that parents should read Ricardo to their children.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. Mr. Trump said during the presidential campaign that he would declare China a currency manipulator on ""Day 1"" of his administration. He reiterated that commitment in his ""Contract with the American Voter,"" which said, ""I will direct the secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator."" And on Thursday, Mr. Trump reiterated his longstanding view of China in an interview with Reuters. ""I think they're the grand champions at manipulation of currency,"" Mr. Trump said, adding, ""We'll see what happens.""

But Mr. Mnuchin had already made clear hours earlier that the administration did not intend for anything to happen, at least immediately. In a televised interview with CNBC, Mr. Mnuchin said that China's currency practices would be evaluated on the same schedule as those of other American trading partners. The Treasury publishes biannual reports on April 15 and October 15. ""We have a process within Treasury where we go through and look at currency manipulation across the board,"" he said. ""We'll go through that process. We'll do that as we have in the past. We're not making any judgments until we continue that process."" Specialists in currency policy say that they see no evidence that China is suppressing the value of its currency to increase exports, as it did in previous decades. The White House and the Treasury Department did not respond to requests for comment. If the United States determines that China is manipulating its currency, a step the Treasury last took in 1994, the government would seek to reach an agreement with China, but could eventually impose tariffs on Chinese imports.

Well,How to Know When a Child's Flu Turns Serious,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/well/family/children-flu-infants-deaths-influenza-complications-fever-breathing-symptoms.html,"The standard prescription for flu is to stay home and rest, drink plenty of fluids, and keep pain and fever under control with over-the-counter drugs like acetaminophen. But this flu season has been a particularly scary one for parents. At least 53 children across the country have died from flu-related illness, and parents need to know how to tell if a child takes a turn for the worse -- and if it's time to rush to the hospital. It's not an easy question to answer, experts say. ""Every once in a while, even among healthy children, this influenza strain and others can make a person very, very sick, really fast,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ""It's deceptive.""

And while the vast majority of otherwise healthy children will ride out a bout of influenza and recover rather quickly, a small number will develop potentially life-threatening complications that require immediate medical attention, Dr. Schaffner said. Children with chronic health conditions like asthma, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, cerebral palsy, heart conditions or seizures are also at increased risk for developing influenza-related complications, and the illness can exacerbate their underlying medical problems. But half of the children hospitalized with influenza this flu season did not have any of the underlying chronic conditions that make children susceptible to complications from influenza, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and that's not unusual. What to Watch For Signs to watch for in children are persistent high fevers that don't subside and fevers that abate only to flare up again after the child seems to be over the worst of the illness, experts say.

When that happens, time is of the essence; a persistent or recurrent fever may mean the child has developed a complication such as pneumonia or a dangerous inflammatory response, and parents must seek prompt medical attention. Parents should also be on the lookout for sepsis, a life-threatening complication caused by the body's overwhelming attack against an infection. The condition is characterized by fever or chills, extreme pain or discomfort, clammy or sweaty skin, confusion or disorientation, shortness of breath, and a high heart rate. ""The trick with the flu is that it happens very quickly,"" said Dr. Flor M. Munoz, associate professor of pediatrics and infectious diseases at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""You have to be really paying attention. Things can progress within 48 hours or so."" Symptoms that call for immediate medical care are if a child's breathing becomes labored, and he or she is taking fast, shallow breaths or feels chest pain or pressure; if the child's lips turn blue or purple; if he or she is less responsive than usual; if the child's skin becomes clammy; or if the child refuses to eat or drink or has diarrhea and is vomiting, raising the risk of dehydration. In general, if a child is particularly irritable, is sleeping too much, seems confused, dizzy or not mentally alert, and not acting like his or her usual self, parents should seek medical help. Severe vomiting and seizures are also danger signs. For children under 2, parents must be vigilant about making sure their child is getting enough fluids, and watch for urine that becomes dark in color, a sign of dehydration that calls for immediate medical care. Other symptoms to watch for in infants are trouble breathing, inability to eat, significantly fewer wet diapers than normal and crying without producing tears. Ibuprofen or acetaminophen can be used in older children, but acetaminophen is the preferred drug for fever in infants. It should be used only in appropriate doses, as instructed on the package (aspirin should never be used in children).

""For a baby under 1, there's a lower threshold to see the doctor,"" Dr. Munoz said. ""I would be willing to wait a little longer on a 12-year-old who can tell me how he feels, but for a baby that age, it's hard for a parent to know what's going on. You have to watch them very carefully and be attuned to changes."" While it may not sound scientific, most experts say parents should trust their instincts. They know their children better than anyone else, and if they think something is wrong, they should call a doctor and ask for advice, or take the child to an urgent care center or emergency room. ""When mom is really worried, that should not be trivialized -- the pediatrician should look at that child closely,"" Dr. Schaffner said. For most children, a typical course of influenza starts with an abrupt spike in temperature, a sore throat, cough and muscle aches, said Dr. Shikha Garg, medical officer in the C.D.C.'s influenza division. Younger children may also have nausea and vomiting. But in most healthy children, the illness will run its course relatively quickly. The fever will subside after three to four days, and the cough will abate within one to two weeks, Dr. Garg said. ""If this is what a parent is seeing, it's probably fine to have the child stay home and not go to school; you want them to rest and stay hydrated,"" she said. ""The majority of healthy children who have a mild course of disease do not need to go to see the doctor, and they do not need to go to the hospital or the emergency room."" They also don't need to be tested for influenza, she said. While children hospitalized with influenza are generally treated with antiviral medication such as Tamiflu, the decision to prescribe it for outpatients is a complicated one that requires a careful balancing of risks and benefits, since the treatment can cause side effects, including nausea, vomiting and, rarely, neurological side effects, Dr. Schaffner said.",Signs to watch for are persistent high fevers and fevers that flare up again after the child seems to be over the worst of the illness.,66dfb2c3-bedd-52f4-8366-77877bd1031e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/08/well/08flu-kids/well-flu-kids-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=455a721bebc0491e7d197c585066e465fb7a4778dac35fece419fc7a69fd2189&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ethan Lasorsa, 12, of Macungie, Pa., was treated for flu and an ear infection in the pediatric ward at Lehigh Valley Hospital-Cedar Crest in Allentown, Pa.",66dfb2c3-bedd-52f4-8366-77877bd1031e,N24News/imgs/66dfb2c3-bedd-52f4-8366-77877bd1031e.jpg,18
Fashion & Style,Unforgettable Moments,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/fashion/new-york-fashion-week-history-moments.html,"In the '70s, Halston's show at Olympic Tower was the ticket of the week, conceived in a modernist way that hadn't been seen before, against a backdrop of glass walls with a view all the way downtown. He seemed to know that it was glamour people wanted. A cashmere floor-length sweater would turn into an evening dress with the addition of an Elsa Peretti snake belt or a beautiful silver harness, a cashmere wrap thrown over one shoulder. The twin sets, the Ultrasuede: It was the language of fashion that permeated the '70s, and it had a lasting effect. His shows were a merging of fashion, art, culture and the society of that time. You would see in one row Andy Warhol with his camera, Martha Graham, Lily Auchincloss, Diana Vreeland and Bianca Jagger. But his stable, his family, it was the models, the Halstonettes. They would go out together to the Met Ball, to the clubs, spilling out into New York dressed in appropriately dazzling evening clothes. They would travel as a posse and merge, along with Liza and Andy, on the banquettes at Studio 54.

In the 1970s, we were coming into something new. There were clubs: the Loft, the Circus, the private clubs, all dingy and sexually oriented. One night, Steve Rubell was turned away at one of them. He turned to me and said: ""I'm going to get revenge. You'll see, Pat. Everyone will come to my club."" Then along came this wonderful Studio 54, where you could dress up and be seen. We wore these see-through tulle gold dresses and blinding electric-looking shoes. Our hair was fuzzed and teased. Everybody was looking twinkly, like in a fairy tale. In those days, people could go under the bridge and get inspired by the drag queens. And it was all reflected on the streets and in the shows. The most exuberant show I ever went to was the Lane Bryant show. Freddie Leiba had styled it. In the old days, if you were a large-size woman, you were propelled in the direction of modest, covered-up fashion. But Freddie made the show cheeky and sexy. I was sitting next to Isaac Hayes. He was wearing an amazing embellished caftan. All through the show, he kept up a wonderful rapping commentary in my ear, saying over and over, ""My, these ladies are deliciously endowed.""

In the spring of 1994, I was doing the creative consulting and the production for a Calvin Klein fashion show. We were doing model go-sees -- where you have models try on the collection -- and Nadja Auermann walked in, this 6-foot-1 Amazon. Calvin put a quintessential nude-on-nude chiffon tank dress on her. She looked stunning, and her body was totally filling out the dress. Meanwhile, waiting behind a rack in the dressing room was Kate Moss. And Calvin said, ""Put the dress on Kate,"" and we put the dress on Kate, who was 5-foot-7. The dress fell away from her body. Calvin took one look and said, ""Put the flat sandals on her."" And then I said, ""Take out the lining."" In that instant, we went from this Amazonian, athletic, full-bodied movie-star model to this teenage girl with no makeup and stringy hair. And that is how the waif was born.

The Proenza Schouler graduate thesis collection at Parsons in the early 2000s was not an extravaganza, but from that first collection you could see the makings of a quintessential New York fashion house. The designers, Lazaro Hernandez and Jack McCollough, had this uptown-downtown aesthetic. We at Barneys were over budget, but they put on such a good performance during the initial selling appointment that we bought the collection. Unbeknown to us, they had nothing to work with: no material, no production. But they figured it out, delivered the collection on time and we sold it. In 1985, we did a show in New York for Comme des Garcons. They were about to open a store in Manhattan. We did the show in this amazing building, like a garage, in Long Island City. Jean-Michel Basquiat walked the runway. Just at the end of the show, as everyone was preparing to leave, it started to snow -- a glistening, soft snow. And through it we could just make out the skyline of New York. It was like a fairy tale.

The first Marc Jacobs show I ever saw was in the early 1980s, at Charivari [the fashion boutique, now shuttered], where they were selling Marc's collection. A model came out wearing a sweater with a big smiley face on it. Marc's grandmother, I think, had knitted the sweater. It was such a happy sweater and such a happy collection. You knew you were seeing a young star. When Marc Jacobs introduced his grunge collection that was inspired by Nirvana [for Perry Ellis], I didn't get it. I thought, ""What is this mess?"" Later I understood that it was an important moment. I don't know if it sold in the stores, but the collection turned fashion in the direction of something more youthful. It was anti-fashion fashion. I loved Marc's grunge show. I was at Bazaar with Liz Tilberis [Bazaar's editor in chief] at the time. Anna Sui was showing grunge, too. Because I knew both Marc and Anna, their choice of inspiration didn't strike me as odd. The inspiration was all thrift, but it was done in a luxurious way. The models wore layers and double hats. Supposedly Marc got fired from Perry Ellis after that show because the collection wasn't part of the DNA of the house. But to me it was gorgeous and not so far off from what Perry originally stood for. We photographed it right away. My first show in New York was Marc Jacobs, in February 2009. I had no idea how the fashion system worked, no idea what the press system was. I just thought: ""O.K. Marc Jacobs invited me to the show. I have to go."" In one of the earliest shows that I did -- I would imagine it was in 1978 -- people had to walk through the dressing room and, from there, the entire length of the showroom to find their seats. Niki de Gunzburg, who was an editor at Vogue and my mentor, arrived, and Carrie Donovan and Polly Mellen, who at that time was at Harper's Bazaar. Women's Wear Daily was there and a slew of other editors. There was always this rivalry among them about who gets which piece first to photograph for their publications.

Then suddenly, in the middle of the show, the music stopped. In those days, we had reel-to-reel tapes playing in a different room at the far end of the showroom. That meant I had to pick myself up and walk through the showroom past all the guests to where the tape recorder was. I found the tape all jumbled up. I don't know what I did, but it started to play again. Everyone started applauding. We were showing fall 1991 in the middle of a heat wave at the end of April. I thought I was being a renegade putting on my show in a raw loft space. There was no air-conditioning and only one set of elevators. The girls backstage were dripping sweat. I started the show. We were on the fifth outfit, and from backstage I heard an explosion. It sounded like gunfire. Naomi Campbell came running backstage to tell me, ""The ceiling just fell.""

So we swept up the dust, I turned down the volume and the show went on. One of my favorite shows was the Western show I did in the '70s at the St. Regis hotel. Alva Chinn came out on the runway dancing to disco music. She was wearing some little fur thing and a chamois shirt. Beverly Johnson was in a bright red fur coat. In the middle of the show, all of a sudden, the lights went out and stayed out. All I could think at the time was: ""Oh, no! This show is fantastic. And now nobody is going to be able to see the clothes."" Managing director, Liberty of London; former executive, Henri Bendel and Bergdorf Goodman I was in the front row at Miguel Adrover's fall 2001 show. The space was tentlike, and there was a huge amount of incense, really, really heavy. The lights went down, and out came the first of the looks. That's when they led out the sheep. The runway was raised. A sheep stumbled and landed in the pit between the runway and the spectators. It landed right next to me. We were wrestling it to the ground. All I could think about was that poor crazed sheep. We were working with threeASFOUR. It was the late '90s, and they were then AsFour: Adi, Gabi, Kai and Angela. We were going to be showing at Gotham Hall, a very big venue, but they were fighting all the time. It was: ""No, we're not going to do a show. No, we're breaking up."" I pulled them together, and I told them: ""Here's what's going to happen. People have responded to their invitations. You'll have a full house. If you don't get yourselves together right now, I'm going to stand up at your show with a megaphone and tell everyone how selfish and disturbed you are.""",The wacky and weird events that turned fashion into theater.,41d4bbad-e9b7-5dec-9281-d0a0cf7f576c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/08/fashion/08ORALUM1/08ORALUM1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=5318c5cb17b0e8d976352356a603e2bca20b98af86aeed14ea0f6b9311ee1b5d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Halston, center, and the Halstonettes at the Costume Institute exhibition gala in 1980.",41d4bbad-e9b7-5dec-9281-d0a0cf7f576c,N24News/imgs/41d4bbad-e9b7-5dec-9281-d0a0cf7f576c.jpg,19
Music,"The Playlist: BTS Expands Its Footprint, and 11 More New Songs",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/arts/music/playlist-bts-geko-yeasayer-courtney-barnett.html,"Every Friday, pop critics for The New York Times weigh in on the week's most notable new songs and videos.

Long before the English-speaking pop mainstream took real notice, BTS were already global pop stars. The successes the K-pop outfit have had in this country happened largely without worrying about how it might or might not fit in. On its new release, ""Map of the Soul: Persona,"" it showcases its highest-profile collaborations to date in a way that preserves its core strengths. The shimmering ""Boy With Luv"" features Halsey -- but more importantly, it features Halsey singing in Korean, exactly the sort of bilingual exchange that's all too rare. And ""Make It Right"" is in part written by Ed Sheeran. It has some of his signature soft-soul gestures, but BTS renders them with complexity. The least comfortable collaborations are the ones in which the balance of power is wildly uneven, where one party badly needs something from the other. But all you hear on these songs is mutual respect. JON CARAMANICA

The first new song in two years from Steve Lacy -- who plays in the space-soul outfit the Internet and has collaborated with Blood Orange, Vampire Weekend and others -- is a narcotically mellow inversion of casually strutting 1970s R&B. On the one hand, it's about yearning, with Lacy's vocals aquatically damp; but on the other, Lacy is far too at ease -- far too chill -- to really break a sweat. CARAMANICA

""So Good"" is elegantly rendered, built-by-hand disco from Omar Apollo, one of several strong songs from his impressive new EP, ""Friends."" For the last two years, he's been releasing songs that were sharp but felt tentative, as if he was worried about overstepping boundaries. But on ""Friends,"" he moves toward the upbeat and joyful, and sounds more free than ever. CARAMANICA

Lead singers with Sounds of Blackness -- Ann Nesby, Big Jim Wright and Lauren Evans -- spill over one another with overlapping gospel praise in ""Til I Found You,"" the first single from a new collection by the producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis with various collaborators. The track is built on an easygoing beat and rippling guitar lines, but the singers turn it into an urgent competition to extol the comforts of faith. JON PARELES Yeasayer, 'Let Me Listen in on You'

""I can make your dreams come true/if you let me listen in on you,"" Yeasayer's Anand Wilder sings, as if he's Alexa or Siri or some present or near-future authoritarian state. That's the sweet chorus; the verses are far more paranoid, with no more comfort to offer than, ""Don't look so guilty, you've got nothing to hide."" In a lilt with an electronic pulse -- glancing back at the Cars -- Yeasayer pinpoints where the promise of convenience meets the threat of constant surveillance. PARELES

This exuberant romp about the upsides of getting rich quick is effective and fun, but it's more intriguing for the performers it brings together, a union of singer-rappers of North African heritage: Geko, born in Manchester, England, is of Libyan and Algerian descent; Ay Em, from London, of Egyptian and Moroccan heritage; and French Montana, who grew up in the Bronx but was born in Morocco. Each has a particular take on the blurry line between rapping and melody. To be fair, French Montana mostly phones in his mumbles, but Geko and Ay Em make for a winning tag team. Geko, a strong rapper, sings with a light touch, and Ay Em provides aural and spiritual ballast: ""I just did my prayer, then you know it's back to business."" CARAMANICA

In Courtney Barnett's latest two-chord stomp -- well, three in the chorus -- she's even blunter than usual about self-doubt and alienation: ""I feel stupid, I feel useless, I feel insane,"" she begins. But as she finds a defensive posture -- ""We're gonna tell everyone it's O.K.,"" she sings with a laugh -- the band cranks up, organ and tambourine pile on and voices join her for a rowdy singalong. She may be insecure and alienated, but she's far from alone. PARELES

The guitarist Bill Frisell and the bassist Thomas Morgan released their first duets album two years ago, a collection of performances that smoldered like warm coals and bespoke an easygoing, simpatico new partnership. Now they're back with ""Epistrophy,"" an entire album of covers. It closes with this rendition of ""In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning,"" honoring the old Sinatra ballad's melancholy theme but still animated by Frisell's ebullient warmth. And all the while there is Morgan's virtuoso flexibility; he's as responsive as he is grounded and firm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

With Abrams, a veteran bassist affiliated with Chicago's broad-minded experimental jazz community, it makes less sense to speak of tracks than to talk about stories. Each of the four lengthy performances on his new album with Natural Information Society unfolds slowly and consequentially, with a sense of abstract narrative. On the nearly 24-minute ""In Memory's Prism,"" Abrams keeps the underlying bass line -- played on the guembri, and indebted to North African music -- almost unchanged while the harmony and instrumentation slowly shift above. (At various times, there's harmonium and trumpet and autoharp and bass clarinet in there, to name a few.) It all has the implacable momentum of migration, or the feeling of a big new idea just coming into being. At the very least, it will put your mind in a place of peaceful wandering; by the end, you're likely to wind up deep in your own imagination, remembering or inventing a story of your own.

Technology,Push for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say It's Gone Too Far,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/23/technology/silicon-valley-men-backlash-gender-scandals.html,"Credit...Jason Henry for The New York Times



Push for Gender Equality in Tech? Some Men Say It's Gone Too Far



SAN FRANCISCO -- Their complaints flow on Reddit forums, on video game message boards, on private Facebook pages and across Twitter. They argue for everything from male separatism to an end to gender diversity efforts. Silicon Valley has for years accommodated a fringe element of men who say women are ruining the tech world. Now, as the nation's technology capital -- long identified as one of the more hostile work environments for women -- reels from a series of high-profile sexual harassment and discrimination scandals, these conversations are gaining broader traction. One of those who said there had been a change is James Altizer, an engineer at the chip maker Nvidia. Mr. Altizer, 52, said he had realized a few years ago that feminists in Silicon Valley had formed a cabal whose goal was to subjugate men. At the time, he said, he was one of the few with that view.

Mr. Altizer said that a gathering he hosts in person and online to discuss men's issues had grown by a few dozen members this year to more than 200, that the private Facebook pages he frequents on men's rights were gaining new members and that a radical subculture calling for total male separatism was emerging. ""It's a witch hunt,"" he said in a phone interview, contending men are being fired by ""dangerous"" human resources departments. ""I'm sitting in a soundproof booth right now because I'm afraid someone will hear me. When you're discussing gender issues, it's almost religious, the response. It's almost zealotry."" Mr. Altizer is part of a backlash against the women in technology movement. While many in the tech industry had previously dismissed the fringe men's rights arguments, some investors, executives and engineers are now listening. Though studies and surveys show there is no denying the travails women face in the male-dominated industry, some said that the line for what counted as harassment had become too easy to cross and that the push for gender parity was too extreme a goal. Few were willing to talk openly about their thinking, for fear of standing out in largely progressive Silicon Valley.

Many men now feel like ""there's a gun to the head"" to be better about gender issues, said Rebecca Lynn, a venture capitalist at Canvas Ventures, and while ""there's a high awareness right now, which is positive, at the same time there's a fear."" The backlash follows increasingly vulgar harassment revelations in Silicon Valley. Several female engineers and entrepreneurs this year named the men they accused of harassing them, and suddenly tech's boys' club seemed anything but impervious. Travis Kalanick, Uber's co-founder, resigned as chief executive after the ride-hailing service was embroiled in harassment accusations. Dave McClure, head of the incubator 500 Startups, called himself ""a creep"" and stepped down. This month, the chief executive of Social Finance, Mike Cagney, also quit amid a harassment scandal. In the aftermath, many stood up for gender equality in tech. Reid Hoffman, LinkedIn's founder, asked investors to sign a ""decency pledge."" Many companies reiterated that they needed to improve work force diversity. ""In just the last 48 hours, I've spoken to a female tech executive who was grabbed by a male C.E.O. at a large event and another female executive who was asked to interview at a venture fund because they 'feel like they need to hire a woman,'"" said Dick Costolo, the former chief of Twitter, who now runs the fitness start-up Chorus. ""We should worry about whether the women-in-tech movement has gone too far sometime after a couple of these aren't regularly happening anymore.""

After months of apologizing by Silicon Valley for bad behavior, here was a young man whom some in tech's leadership could potentially get behind. Paul Graham, who founded an influential start-up incubator, Y Combinator, posted two articles about how the science behind Mr. Damore's memo was accurate. Another start-up investor, John Durant, wrote that ""Charles Darwin himself would be fired from Google for his views on the sexes."" And the investor Peter Thiel's business partner, Eric Weinstein, tweeted, ""Dear @Google, Stop teaching my girl that her path to financial freedom lies not in coding but in complaining to HR.""

Silicon Valley has always been a men's space, others said. Warren Farrell, who lives in Marin County, Calif., and whose 1993 book, ""The Myth of Male Power,"" birthed the modern men's rights movement, said, ""The less safe the environment is for men, the more they will seek little pods of safety like the tech world."" This turn in the gender conversation is good news for Mr. Damore. ""The emperor is naked,"" he said in an interview. ""Since someone said it, now it's become sort of acceptable."" He added, ""The whole idea that diversity improves workplace output, it's not scientifically decided that that's true."" Mr. Damore filed a labor complaint against Google in August and said more than 20 people had reached out about joining together for a class-action suit about systemic discrimination against men. He is represented by Harmeet Dhillon, a local firebrand lawyer.

Two men who worked at Yahoo sued the company for gender discrimination last year. Their lawyer, Jon Parsons, said the female leadership -- Yahoo's chief executive was Marissa Mayer, before Verizon bought the company -- had gone too far in trying to hire and promote women. He tied the suit into today's women-in-tech movement. ""When you're on a mission from God to set the world straight, it's easy to go too far,"" Mr. Parsons said. ""There was no control over women hiring women."" He said that his clients, Greg Anderson and Scott Ard, had faced gender discrimination in Yahoo's media teams and that other teams like cars were headed by women, which to Mr. Parsons was a sign of problems. ""No eyebrows are going to rise if a woman heads up fashion,"" Mr. Parsons said. ""But we're talking about women staffing positions -- things like autos -- where it cannot be explained other than manipulation."" Those leading Silicon Valley's gender equality push said they were astonished that just as the movement was having an impact, it opened up an even more radical men's rights perspective.

""It's exhausting,"" said Joelle Emerson, who runs Paradigm, a company that designs diversity strategies. ""It's created divides that I didn't anticipate."" One radical fringe that is growing is Mgtow, which stands for Men Going Their Own Way and pronounced MIG-tow. Mgtow aims for total male separatism, including forgoing children, avoiding marriage and limiting involvement with women. Its message boards are brimming with activity from Silicon Valley, Mr. Altizer said. Cassie Jaye, who lives in Marin County and made a documentary about the men's rights movement called ""The Red Pill,"" said that the tech world and the men's rights community had ""snowballed"" together and that the rise in the number of people in Mgtow is new. On the Mgtow message boards, members discuss work (""Ever work for a woman? Roll up your sleeves and share your horror story""), technology (""The stuff girlfriends and wives can't stand -- computers, games, consoles"") and dating (mostly best practices to avoid commitment). ""I think there are a lot of guys living this lifestyle without naming it, and then they find Mgtow,"" said Ms. Jaye, who calls herself a former feminist. Mr. Altizer leads Bay Area Fathers' Rights, a monthly support group for men to talk about the issues they uniquely face. He became interested in the community after a divorce and said his eyes were opened to how few rights men have. As for the numbers of women in tech, the effort for parity is absurd, he said. ""I've been on the hiring side for years,"" Mr. Altizer said, adding that he is not currently hiring people. ""It would be nice to have women, but you cannot find applicants.""","After revelations of harassment and bias in Silicon Valley, a backlash is growing against the women in tech movement.",87a2309b-15e7-5f1c-a183-a0fe60fa10ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/23/business/00VALLEYMEN-1/00VALLEYMEN-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=13eeac58278cd3f7cf49dc0d7c48c528c81cc7196bade36dbd720a32ec1d1af4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,James Damore was fired by Google last month after suggesting that there may be biological reasons for gender gaps in tech jobs.,87a2309b-15e7-5f1c-a183-a0fe60fa10ff,N24News/imgs/87a2309b-15e7-5f1c-a183-a0fe60fa10ff.jpg,20
Automobiles,Chrysler Hopes New Pacifica Can Make Minivan Cool,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/automobiles/wheels/chrysler-pacifica-minivan.html,"Study just the details of Chrysler's new Pacifica and it's tough to peg its mission. Very roomy, it would be a great replacement for the Town and Country minivan, because, well, it is. S.U.V.s are the automotive fashion families want these days, but Pacifica's toned body could pull off yoga pants. If cars did that kind of thing, (ON CAMERA) As a parent and as a guy that's driven over 800 different vehicles, I can assure you, nothing makes family life easier than a van. Kids get in and out easier plus sliding doors can't ding other cars, nice touch with the hidden track. Haul full sheets of plywood? Done. Some of the features this specific car has... (ON CAMERA) It can find parking spots and guide you in. Probably faster than you or I can. Cross rails store in the rack, always ready for action. Oblivious while backing up? (SOUND UP) Braking is automatic (ON CAMERA) I was hoping that would work. My house does not have this many storage nooks. And yes, a vacuum cleaner is available. It's easy to move the front chairs out of the way. (ON CAMERA) Why is that important? Well, Chrysler products are the only vehicles to do this. Stow 'n Go seats easily fold into the floor. Middle row chairs must be removed and stored with other vans. These bins can hold toys or sports gear. The chairs are more comfortable now. With seating for eight, one has to be taken out, but it's light. The setup makes Pacifica supremely useful. The downside? No all-wheel drive. Pacificas have a single powertrain for now (SOUND UP) a 3.6-liter V6 with 287 horsepower (SOUND UP) connected to a 9-speed automatic that feels well calibrated. Vans get loaded with people and gear (SOUND UP) this one moves briskly. (ON CAMERA) You don't have to yell ""stop hitting your brother"" because Pacifica is near luxury car quiet. You can use a more civilized tone ""I don't care who started it"". $2,000 buys adaptive cruise control plus, auto braking with pedestrian detection. The lane keep assist is aggressive and distracting, I turned it off. (ON CAMERA) None of the vehicles in this class are going to handle like sports cars but darned if Chrysler didn't do a good job of tuning the driving dynamics. Don't make the kids car sick. Fuel efficiency is on the higher side in-class; I'm seeing 22 miles-per-gallon. (ON CAMERA) If you want better fuel economy than that, there will be a plug-in hybrid Pacifica that has an electric-only range of 30 miles. But it eliminates the Stow 'n Go seating feature because those wells are where the battery pack goes. The cabin, which looks great, gives frazzled parents a warm feeling, at least their hands. Cubbies are easy to clean. The interface is refreshing clear. Parking for umbrellas is oh so handy, and cute. With these mid-row amenities, kids will never believe your stories of walking to school in the snow, barefoot, uphill, both ways. If forgetting the X-Box is their biggest hardship, on-board games can be played against the computer or, here's a concept, other passengers. (ON CAMERA) Math skills. Very important Car seats don't need to be removed (SOUND UP) to get to row three (ON CAMERA) Two full-sized adults will fit back here, three certainly in a pinch. Something not all three-row crossovers can say. Not just cup holders but a place to charge phones too. (ON CAMERA) Using all three rows of seating in an SUV means you get four or five packs of this stuff in the cargo hold. Pacifica? Ten. Drop row three which is very, very, easy and Pacifica is a rolling warehouse. I can only physically bring so much TP out, before it falls off the cart. This is 20 packs, pretty sure it swallows 28. (ON CAMERA) As I tell my kids, use your imagination. We don't do that enough. Starting at under 29 grand, this one goes for about 48. The market has shrunk but Chrysler is clearly defending the segment they invented. Switching out an established name for one from a discontinued crossover shows an eagerness to start fresh. Pacifica is an impressive think-outside-the-box effort.","A reinvented model uses improved fold-flat back seats, high-definition video screens and a sculptured design to overcome a stodgy image.",85af26a1-883d-57a1-9a62-72fe34d5ef44,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/03/business/03WHEELS/03WHEELS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=26e63a9bed3aaddb58d237bbd90e7cf384550074c2808ff8915fb117c5ab0089&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Barbara Rigney of Ann Arbor, Mich., with her new Chrysler Pacifica.

Well,How to Celebrate a Birthday During the Coronavirus Shutdown,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/well/how-to-celebrate-a-birthday-during-the-coronavirus-shutdown.html,"It became clear in mid-March that my birthday plans for the end of the month had to be canceled. After a quick self-pity session my focus shifted from what I'd be losing (happy hour with my friends at my favorite dim sum spot, a haircut with my favorite stylist, a massage) to what I could control about the day. After all, my birthday may have been marred by the coronavirus shutdown, but with the great pain being experienced by the world, now also felt like a great time to celebrate life. In order to feel a sense of normalcy, two things were most important to me: baking my own birthday cake and arranging a video call with my family. I instructed relatives to supply their own cakes so we could all blow out candles together over Zoom. I even took a picture of our family chat!

Whether you're the one blowing out candles, or you're the one trying to make your house feel festive for someone else's birthday, here's how to give the day meaning when we're all limiting contact. Accept your feelings about the situation. ""Peace comes when we realize what our circumstances are and can then ask, 'Given this time, what feels best to me?'"" said Shasta Nelson, a friendship expert and the author of ""Frientimacy: How to Deepen Friendships for Lifelong Health and Happiness."" ""There is no wrong answer."" If you want to book virtual happy hours, go for it. If you want to do a more scaled-down celebration, that's fine, too. Do what feels best for you. Be mindful of the way you speak about the situation. Instead of grumbling about how you have to be stuck at home, reframe the thought: You're choosing to stay home and be healthy, said Mary Foston-English, a licensed marriage and family therapist. While you're at it, also nix the phrase ""have to,"" as it ""encourages us to feel helpless and hopeless and limits our options to think more openly and feel better,"" she added. Organize a virtual party if you feel like it. For her birthday on March 31, Sarah Solomon made the best of the circumstances as she was sheltering in place. Ms. Solomon, the author of ""Guac Is Extra but So Am I: The Reluctant Adult's Handbook,"" invited about 20 friends via text message to her virtual birthday party, a group video chat hosted on Zoom. She made sure that everyone on the list was already acquainted so that ""it wouldn't be even more awkward than a video conferencing party already is.""

To make your virtual party fun for everyone in attendance, consider asking guests to prepare something to do or eat as a group. For her party, Ms. Solomon encouraged participants to dress up in black-tie-optional clothing. ""Drinking dirty martinis alone in a ball gown isn't totally out of the norm for me,"" she said, ""but it was nice to make it a group effort."" Pick something simple: wine and cheese, pizza, cupcakes or champagne. Just make sure whatever you come up with will be fairly easy to secure with advance notice, or, better yet, is already in everyone's home. It's also important to give the party some structure. Consider giving prompts to guests so the conversation will flow. For example, ask them to recount a happy or silly memory of you. Perhaps guests can share a positive intention they have for the year. Decide on an end time for the party in advance so people don't have to awkwardly log off. When it comes to gifts, be upfront. When relatives asked what I wanted for my birthday, I encouraged them to email me gift cards for my favorite beauty brands and local restaurants. Letting people know what kinds of gifts I'd appreciate gave my inner circle direction and flexibility. You can also direct people to contribute to a charity of your choice or forgo gifts altogether. Go easy on yourself if your emotions are all over the place. It's a scary, uncertain time. It's understandable if you feel overwhelmed. ""Treat yourself kindly by focusing on what you are grateful for, trying to keep your mind in the present moment, or even simply taking a break from your self-judgment, for example,"" said Dr. Jena Lee, a child and adult psychiatrist and a clinical instructor at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California, Los Angeles. If you're in a lingering funk or experiencing excessive sadness or disappointment about your birthday, consult a mental health professional. ""Prioritizing mental and relational wellness is crucial right now,"" said Melody Li, a licensed marriage and family therapist and the founder of Inclusive Therapists, a social justice-oriented therapist community. ""If you've been considering starting therapy, now can be a good time to start and receive support."" Let them know their strong feelings are justified. Dr. Lee suggests saying: ""This is so frustrating that you can't celebrate your birthday despite all of your planning. This celebration is so important to you and your friends. That would be pretty hard for me, too."" Once we've mirrored their disappointment, then we can see if they want help brainstorming other options, Ms. Nelson said.

Give the other people permission to choose how to celebrate. ""One of the best gifts we can give to those in our lives is permission to do whatever feels best to them this year without guilt,"" Ms. Nelson said. ""They don't have to do more than they have energy to do, and neither do they have to downplay it just because others are grieving."" Give yourself plenty of time to book services and have packages shipped. Ms. Solomon was delighted when a dear friend gave her a fancy bottle of champagne through Drizly, an online liquor store. ""I promised her that we'd pop and drink it together after New York City is in the clear,"" she said. My husband sent me personalized video messages from my favorite reality show celebrities through Cameo. It definitely lifted my spirits! If you're celebrating a child's birthday during this lockdown, don't be afraid to get a little silly. ""Have a dance party at home, create a treasure hunt or a baking show that can be shared by video to family,"" Dr. Lee said. Whatever you choose to do, as long as you approach the day with a positive attitude, it will help children make lasting memories. Sometimes the best gift is sending a heartfelt message of appreciation to someone you love. Expressing that you care can be an unforgettable gift, Dr. Lee said. Ms. Nelson said we should think about something we can do to make our friends feel seen and loved. That could mean organizing a group effort online or reaching out to connect one to one. Just be authentic to what feels right for your relationship.",Stay-at-home orders don't have to put a damper on your special day.,6d4645a3-80ef-557e-bb9c-e7d64fe1b736,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/07/smarter-living/07coronavirus-birthday/07coronavirus-birthday-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=a49283e4adcde1e5b4204f85ee3b634c74dc3c859d8280d9ed4e6e149456b566&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The author's family joined her virtually on her birthday.,6d4645a3-80ef-557e-bb9c-e7d64fe1b736,N24News/imgs/6d4645a3-80ef-557e-bb9c-e7d64fe1b736.jpg,18
Music,Cardi B's 'WAP' Proves Music's Dirty Secret: Censorship Is Good Business,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/arts/music/clean-versions-explicit-songs.html,"Doc Wynter still remembers the first time he heard ""WAP."" A top radio programmer for decades, Wynter has come across countless explicit rap tracks and ""blue"" R&B songs that required nips and tucks before they could be played on-air. But even Wynter, the head of hip-hop and R&B programming for the broadcasting giant iHeartMedia, was taken aback by ""WAP,"" Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's brazenly graphic anthem of lubrication, when he was given a preview before the song's release in August. ""It hits you at the very beginning -- like, whoa! -- and then it just keeps on going and going and going,"" Wynter said, still marveling at the song's barrage of suggestive imagery. ""Thank God we have systems in place,"" he recalled thinking, ""that prevented that record from hitting the airwaves."" Of course, ""WAP"" did hit the airwaves, and the streaming services, in a big way. One of the year's most inescapable hits, it held No. 1 on Billboard's Hot 100 chart for four weeks and drew 1.1 billion clicks on streaming platforms. An instant social media phenomenon, the song spawned remixes and memes galore, including a subgenre of outraged-slash-titillated parental reaction videos.

Yet despite the song's uninhibited raunch, its popularity was partly earned from one of the music industry's oldest bugaboos: self-censorship. Before ""WAP"" could be played on the radio, its most explicit verbiage was pruned by Cardi B's engineers. Wynter recalled that the ostensibly sanitized copy first offered by Cardi B's label, Atlantic -- the ""clean"" version of the song, in industry jargon -- was still too racy for broadcast, leading Wynter to ask for nine additional, last-minute edits. And the music video for ""WAP"" that caught fire on YouTube was elaborately censored. If fans listened only to that version, they wouldn't have learned what its title acronym stood for -- instead, just that something was ""wet and gushy."" The success of ""WAP"" highlighted one of the music industry's dirty little secrets: that even in an age of rampant vulgarity -- and 35 long years since a crackdown on lyrics by the Washington elite -- the bowdlerizing of pop songs remains deeply ingrained in the work of artists and their marketers. Today, most major releases that have some naughty words -- including the latest from Taylor Swift and even Stevie Wonder -- also come out in censored versions. Decades ago, that may have been done in part to avoid political controversy. Now business is the driving force, as labels chase down every click and playlist placement to maximize songs' streaming income.

That was when Tipper Gore, who was married to Al Gore, then a United States Senator from Tennessee, helped start the crusading Parents Music Resource Center after being scandalized by a Prince song. Her group called for warning stickers on albums, a suggestion echoed during a Senate committee hearing the same year, which stirred fears of encroachment on musicians' First Amendment rights. ""If it looks like censorship and it smells like censorship,"" Frank Zappa said at the time, ""it is censorship."" Then as now, race played a complex role. Black art has always been policed aggressively, particularly in popular music genres -- a continuum that stretches from jazz to rock to hip-hop. But in the 1980s, rock and metal came under fire as well, and seemingly anything on the radio was a potential target. In one of the most surreal moments of the 1985 Senate hearings, John Denver defended his song ""Rocky Mountain High"" against accusations that it glorified drug abuse. Record companies soon agreed to affix a ""parental advisory"" sticker on albums that they -- not an outside regulator -- deemed to include ""strong language or depictions of violence, sex or substance abuse.""

That move may have staved off further scrutiny in Washington. But it led to complications in the market as big box retailers like Walmart, Best Buy and Target came to dominate sales in the 1990s. Some of them refused to carry explicit content, which meant that anything that bore the labels' black-and-white warning sticker risked not being stocked -- and could lose as much as 40 percent of potential sales, music executives said. ""The public controversy -- the regulatory threat -- never felt as great as the retail threat,"" said Hilary Rosen, a former chief executive of the Recording Industry Association of America. The record companies' solution: produce copies of albums scrubbed of their most provocative vocabulary. A golden age of self-censorship followed, with profanities and violent lyrics often simply deleted -- leaving hit songs dotted with brief silences, like holes. ""We used to call it Swiss cheese,"" said Paul Rosenberg, Eminem's longtime manager.

Midway through our conversation, Rosenberg excused himself, saying that ""Marshall"" -- a.k.a. Eminem -- was on the other line. When he returned a minute later, Rosenberg said he told his client that he was ""doing an interview about your explicit lyrics."" Eminem was not alone in willingly tweaking his work. In 1999, when the New Orleans rapper Juvenile released ""Back That Azz Up,"" his label knew it was too risque for radio. So they cut a new version, ""Back That Thang Up,"" which went to No. 19 and ended up a nostalgic favorite. In an interview, Juvenile -- who has recently taken on a second career as a furniture maker -- recalled that he eagerly compromised. ""I wanted to get it to the masses,"" said Juvenile, calling from a Home Depot while shopping for paint. ""Sometimes you have to make sacrifices on the lyrical content -- take a hit on being profane in order for your music to be heard.""

Record executives and artist managers offered various explanations for the inconsistency, although many were not willing to speak on the record. Some musicians, they said, object on principle to the censoring of their work. Though once seen as a bold and risky stance -- Green Day, for example, refused to edit its albums ""American Idiot"" (2004) and ""21st Century Breakdown"" (2009), and forfeited sales at Walmart -- that rarely draws wide notice today. Another reason was structural: In the streaming age, music can be made and released so quickly that little time is left for edits. Those albums may not get a clean version until days or weeks after their initial release, or never. If no edited version is available, radio stations -- or random YouTube users -- may simply make their own. Ghazi, the founder of Empire, an independent distribution company that specializes in hip-hop, thinks that much of the industry fails to grasp the importance of clean versions. ""It's a lost part of the business,"" he said. He noted all the standard opportunities that would disappear without a clean song, like licensing for television and being piped into restaurants and retail shops. But Ghazi, who uses only one name, also pointed to outlets like JPay, which provides music -- clean only -- to prison inmates, as well as to online platforms in Asia and the Middle East that block explicit content. The existence of a clean version can increase some albums' sales as much as 30 percent, according to Ghazi. And the artistry of clean edits has made huge progress since the Swiss cheese days. Jaycen Joshua, a mixing engineer who has worked on releases by Jay-Z, Nicki Minaj, Rihanna and many other artists -- including Megan Thee Stallion -- described an elaborate tool kit of sound effects, stretched-out sibilants and patched vowels to preserve the musical fingerprint of an altered word. ""Anything to give the illusion to the brain that a word is still there, even if you don't hear that explicit word itself,"" Joshua said.

For artists who do not self-censor, the risk may simply be invisibility. Music's consumer landscape is now rife with family streaming plans and parental content-filtering. For customers who set their devices to weed out explicit material, Apple and Amazon automatically substitute edited versions of songs when they are available, and skip them altogether when they aren't. Most of the time, virtually every track on Spotify's powerhouse ""Rap Caviar"" playlist is marked explicit; for a tween on a content leash, it can take three or four arduous clicks to see if a clean alternative is available. Among radio programmers, streaming curators and record executives, the standard scenario to explain the need for clean versions is that of a bystander child: Would an adult object if they heard a particular song with their child in the car, or in earshot of a smart speaker? ""I have a 3-year-old daughter,"" Ghazi said. ""I'm not going to play her Chris Brown singing '[expletive] you back to sleep,' but I might play Chris Brown 'sex you back to sleep.'"" In the 1980s and '90s, the public discourse about explicit music was centered on parents' ability to restrict their children's access to it. In some ways today's content controls are a powerful manifestation of that goal. Yet in the ocean of online content, nothing is truly hidden. Van Sias, a freelance writer in Brooklyn, said that when he and his wife gave their 12-year-old daughter her first iPhone for Christmas last year, they set it to block explicit content on Apple Music. But they know she may come across some on YouTube or Instagram anyway.

For those who lived through the controversies of the Parents Music Resource Center, 2 Live Crew's arrest and Body Count's ""Cop Killer,"" however, the brouhaha around ""WAP"" was a jarring throwback. In a way that now seems quaint, rock and rap were once vilified as threats to basic civility. ""There was a constant cultural war around whether music was at fault for coarsening society,"" said Rosen, who is now a Democratic strategist. ""But when you look at it today, I don't think anyone is accusing Cardi B of coarsening society -- that's Donald Trump's job."" Cardi B herself stoked controversy around her song, which is equally uninhibited in celebrating female desire and in demanding service from men. In an Instagram clip, she said the music video used ""the censored version of the song"" because ""YouTube was like, hold on, wait a minute, the song might just be too [expletive] nasty."" A spokeswoman for YouTube, however, said that the raw version of ""WAP"" did not violate its community guidelines -- that version exists on YouTube as an audio track -- and that Atlantic provided only one edition of the song for its official music video, using edited lyrics. Cardi B and Atlantic declined to comment. But it may have been that Cardi and her label simply strategized that a censored version would generate the most clicks, and anyone interested would probably hear the dirty version anyway. Indeed, ""WAP"" may be the raunchiest No. 1 single of all time.",Scandalized parents and politicians ushered in warning labels in the 1980s. Now making clean versions of explicit songs means taking advantage of every possible revenue stream.,9f8f20ed-6e32-56d5-85d1-414e4137d6d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/01/arts/01clean-versions-illo/01clean-versions-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a94513301e15d61749f8a63a38312eb588b2724f0e74830bf958f99583226f5f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Songs with explicit lyrics fill streaming service playlists, but edited versions are still needed for radio, commercials and other outlets.",9f8f20ed-6e32-56d5-85d1-414e4137d6d1,N24News/imgs/9f8f20ed-6e32-56d5-85d1-414e4137d6d1.jpg,12
Movies,"With 'Lucy in the Sky,' Noah Hawley Expands His Universe",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/movies/with-lucy-in-the-sky-noah-hawley.html,"The director explains how his approach to the show he's known for, ""Fargo,"" was very different for the astronaut tale starring Natalie Portman.

Noah Hawley may be the first director who has ever had to narrow his focus to do a movie set in outer space. Hawley, 52, has long established himself in more expansive mediums. As a television creator, he is known for the Emmy-winning anthology series ""Fargo,"" adapted loosely from the Coen brothers' darkly comic movie, and for ""Legion,"" a dense, surrealistic series based on an X-Men antihero, both for FX. As a novelist, he has written five books , the latest of which, ""Before the Fall"" (2016), has been optioned for the big screen by Sony Pictures. With the premiere last weekend of ""Lucy in the Sky,"" Hawley added feature-film director to his resume, just in time to start shooting Season 4 of ""Fargo"" in Chicago about two weeks later. (The series is the subject of his forthcoming book, ""Fargo: This Is a True Story,"" due Oct. 29, a compendium of scripts, interviews and other ephemera from the show.) ""Lucy"" tells the story of Lucy Cola (Natalie Portman), an astronaut who returns from space to find that her suburban married life has lost its flavor. An existential crisis prompts an affair with a rakish older astronaut (Jon Hamm), which prompts a different kind of crisis -- involving duct tape and a gun. The story is loosely based on the life of Lisa Marie Nowak , an astronaut who in 2007 was arrested in Orlando wearing a trench coat, wig and diaper after driving more than 950 miles to assault a romantic rival.

Did you find making a feature film constraining after all those TV series and novels? Well, that was the challenge -- I don't have formal training in any of it. I didn't go to school to learn how to be a novelist. I didn't go to school to learn how to do television or make a movie. [He was a musician before he started writing fiction.] So for me it's always an experiment. Also, every time I go to a new story or medium I think, ""What am I taking for granted?"" And for me, with the movie, it was the movie theater itself. Is that why you played with the aspect ratio, for example? Everyone thinks you want the biggest picture possible and the loudest sound possible. But this seemed like a real opportunity to explore this woman's existential crisis, her psychological decline, in a way that was really experiential: So for example, when she's in space, everything looks enormous, and the entire screen is filled with the image. When she comes to earth and everything feels small, the image shrinks down and the sound has a similar dynamic. What about the limitations of time? With 10 hours, you can have entire episodes that are digressions or back story. Did you learn anything specific by being forced to go shorter?

It was interesting because my instinct at the script stage was to expand the story more to make sure that Jon Hamm's point of view was really represented, and Zazie Beetz's. [She plays another astronaut.] Then to get into the editing room and sculpt that two-hour experience and realize that there's room for some but not all of it. If you're away from her story for too long, it stops being a positive. And yet, it's still really critical. For example, there's footage of Jon's character alone at night. He's drinking and he's watching and rewatching the Challenger explosion. You see that he's wrestling with some things, too. And you need to see that so you don't think Natalie's character is a crazy person. She's having a hard time processing being back, and he is, too.

Going into it, did you have friends -- other feature directors -- you consulted? Are you still friends with the Coens? We have a very interesting relationship. I don't bother them and they don't bother me. I keep in touch with them, and when I come to New York, if they're around, we'll have a breakfast of varying degrees of awkwardness. It must be so strange for them, where every few years they see all these ""Fargo"" ads. But they're so understated that I'm not even sure a filmmaking conversation with them is something they would be interested in having. Much of your work exhibits a real fascination with suburbia: I wonder if you agree, and if you have a sense of where that fascination comes from?

No, I guess I don't think about it that way. I grew up in the West Village, which has the word village in the name. For me, it really functioned that way -- I can count the number of times I remember going above 14th Street. I did move to Connecticut when I was 15 or 16, the exact moment you don't want to move out of the city, right when everything is about to get interesting. That was not my favorite place, just in terms of going through adolescence and all of a sudden being in suburbia in the height of the Reagan era. Well suburbia feels a little alien in your work. I imagine it must have felt that way when you were suddenly plunked down there. Yeah, I think it did. The things that seemed important to kids were so different. There was this vanilla-ness to it that was alien to me, to which I didn't fit in. Already, as a kid growing up with, let's say, an artistic sensibility, I felt a bit outside to begin with. I mean, I went to Sarah Lawrence College afterward, somewhat as a reaction to the jock.

So how do you go to the suburbs without being a tourist? How do you depict tragic characters like Lucy without falling into the trap of condescension? Everywhere you go people are the same. It's a simplistic way of looking at it, but human drives don't really vary. The older I get, as an artist, the more I find myself concerned with human dignity and with the story as an empathy delivery device. I've always been an ensemble storyteller and like to look at stories from multiple points of view. What that does is create empathy. Certainly, in ""Fargo,"" or in stories where you know violence is coming, I never want that violence to be entertainment. The possibilities for really humanizing that violence and its consequences expand as you sympathize with multiple characters.

Obviously it's inspired by a tabloid story, right? What is a tabloid story if not a story about human beings with dignity who made mistakes, ruin everything, and were reduced to a punch line -- when their punishment was already severe. Lucy's character loses the things she loves the most and she has to figure out how to build a life afterward that's not the life she ever wanted. That's punishment enough, and that's a redemptive story. Natalie and I were very clear about not [reducing] her to a joke or some ""Fatal Attraction"" villain. She makes mistakes, as we all do -- that, in and of itself, should be interesting. It was very important to me not to make a movie about a woman who falls apart because she's too emotional about a man. We don't need that movie. Right? Brad Pitt gets to go to space in this very interior film, but people never question whether he has the right to examine his own life onscreen.","The director explains how his approach to the show he's known for,  ""Fargo,"" was very different for the astronaut tale starring Natalie Portman.",e93106f3-4717-51ca-863c-db4c1ade2198,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/arts/11hawley-bts1/11hawley-bts1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5eff82e502f79e150b8c276bd4c49a83f2e80a628fecb4ac02c7428a9718318a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Hawley and Portman on the set.

Science,"Rocket Launches, Trips to Mars and More 2020 Space and Astronomy Events",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/01/science/space-astronomy-2020.html,"If you follow space news and astronomy, the past year offered no shortage of highlights. Astronomers provided humanity's first glimpse of a black hole. China landed on the moon's far side. And the 50th anniversary of the Apollo 11 moon landing inspired us to look ahead to our future in space. The year to come will be no less eventful:
* None No fewer than four missions to Mars could leave Earth this summer.
* None NASA may finally launch astronauts into orbit aboard capsules built by SpaceX and Boeing.
* None We expect to learn more secrets about the interstellar comet Borisov.
* None And private companies are working to demonstrate new abilities in space. However much you love space and astronomy, it can be challenging to keep up with the latest news in orbit and beyond. That's why we've put dates for some of these events on The Times's Astronomy and Space Calendar, which has been updated for 2020. Subscribe on your personal digital calendar to be automatically synced with our updates all year long. (We promise not to collect any personal information from your private calendar when you sign up.) [Sync your calendar with the solar system.] Below are some of the launches, space science and other events to look forward to.

Roughly every two years, the orbits of Earth and Mars come closer than usual. Space agencies on Earth often send missions to the red planet during that window, and in 2020 four such launches are scheduled. Three of the missions will carry rovers. The United States is launching the soon-to-be-renamed Mars 2020 rover, which also carries a small helicopter. It will try to land in Jezero Crater, which once contained a lake and could preserve evidence of life, if life ever existed there. Neither China, Europe nor Russia has deployed a rover on the Martian surface. But they will try, in a pair of missions. China's mission, its first on its own to the red planet, includes an orbiter in addition to a rover. The European Space Agency and Russia cooperated to build Rosalind Franklin, a rover named for the English chemist whose work was essential to finding the structure of DNA. The rovers could be joined on Mars by Hope, an orbiter commissioned by the United Arab Emirates. It is being built in Colorado, and is to be launched on a Japanese rocket. If it succeeds, it could represent a new model for space programs, of small, wealthy countries getting into orbit and beyond.

Since the space shuttle's last flight, in 2011, NASA has relied on Russia's Soyuz spacecraft for trips to and from the International Space Station. In 2019, NASA hoped to begin flying astronauts aboard capsules built by two private companies, SpaceX and Boeing, but persistent delays knocked back the timeline another year. NASA's commercial crew program could finally achieve its goal in 2020. SpaceX's Crew Dragon is scheduled to conduct an uncrewed test of its in-flight abort system on Jan. 11. If the test succeeds, the capsule could carry astronauts to the space station not long after.

Virgin Galactic, the space-plane company run by Richard Branson, conducted two successful test flights with crew aboard in the past 13 months. In the year to come, the company could carry its first passengers to the edge of space. Blue Origin, the company founded by Jeff Bezos of Amazon, may follow suit; it has conducted 12 crewless tests of its capsule for short tourist jumps to suborbital space. For now, only the very wealthy will be able to afford such jaunts.

Other private companies are looking to Earth orbit for the future of internet service. SpaceX launched 120 Starlink satellites in 2019 and could launch many more in 2020. A competitor, OneWeb, could send more of its satellites to orbit in the coming year, too. These companies are blazing the trail for orbital internet -- a business that Amazon and Apple are also pursuing -- and upsetting astronomers, who fear that large constellations of internet satellites will imperil scientific study of the solar system and stars.

Japan's Hayabusa2 spacecraft concluded several close encounters with Ryugu, a near-Earth asteroid, last year. It twice collected samples from Ryugu's surface, the second time after dropping what amounted to a bomb on the space rock's surface. At the end of 2019, the probe began its trip home. Near the end of this year, it will try to jettison its samples back to Earth's surface, in the Australian outback. Scientists hope to study the material for clues from the solar system's early days. Hayabusa2 wasn't the only spacecraft circling a space rock. NASA's Osiris-Rex spent the year completing a close survey of Bennu, a different, boulder-strewn asteroid. The mission's managers selected a site called Nightingale for a specimen-collection operation that they plan to carry out in August. That spacecraft will return its cargo to Earth in 2023.","A year full of highs and lows in space just ended, and the 12 months to come  will be full of new highlights in orbit and beyond.",bd8647b3-8ec6-50aa-95cf-2b81ed12d2dd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/01/science/01SPACEPREVIEW1/01SPACEPREVIEW1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f25f95543fbd498fd5d29a2cbd862e245e7831101d27e6f4ba31a5c1f17220f6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Spectators viewing the launch of a Soyuz rocket carrying crew to the International Space Station from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan in September.,bd8647b3-8ec6-50aa-95cf-2b81ed12d2dd,N24News/imgs/bd8647b3-8ec6-50aa-95cf-2b81ed12d2dd.jpg,2

Opinion,We Represented the Whistle-Blower. The Law Needs Urgent Help.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/opinion/whistleblower-intelligence-community.html,"Whistle-blowers are needed now more than ever. They must be persuaded that while there are always risks, the system can protect them. We served as the attorneys for the intelligence community whistle-blower, and every step of the way we sought to protect them from reprisal, threats and disclosure of their identity. The last six months have tested the boundaries of the integrity of our country's whistle-blower protections, not just from the framework of the law but also with respect to public perception. We were honored to represent the whistle-blower, who has smoothly transitioned to new counsel -- but we will continue to work, as we have for years, to strengthen the intelligence community whistle-blower system for future whistle-blowers. This case showed that the whistle-blower disclosure process can work, although there is much to be done to reinforce it. After the complaint was filed with the intelligence community's inspector general in August 2019, it made its way to Congress for oversight. Though the White House and the Department of Justice sought to block its progress, pressure from the legal team, Congress and the public forced the system to work. Was this perfect? No. But it ensured the serious allegations of misconduct reached the right people.

Our former client faced, and still faces, a sustained public campaign of intimidation -- including repeated tweets by President Trump and other senior figures that the whistle-blower must be publicly outed -- despite having participated in an established and encouraged process that guaranteed them certain protections under the law. Even members of Congress, individuals within the very body that created the statutory protections that exist for whistle-blowers, sought to expose the whistle-blower for political purposes and created harmful doubts concerning the integrity of the system. Joseph Maguire, until last week the acting director of national intelligence and himself an appointee of Mr. Trump, stated in public testimony last September that the whistle-blower ""acted in good faith and followed the law every step of the way."" The whistle-blower demonstrated that one can ensure that legitimate oversight occurs within the confines of the law and the policies and procedures of the intelligence community. Whistle-blowers play a particularly critical role in Congress's ability to oversee the intelligence community. As the executive branch controls classified information, the House and Senate Intelligence Committees are reliant on inspectors general and whistle-blowers to conduct their constitutionally mandated oversight over federal agencies and even the president of the United States. In correspondence dated Oct. 22, 2019, the Council of the Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency, composed of dozens of appointees, made it clear that ""whistle-blowers play an essential public service in coming forward"" by reporting their reasonable belief of waste, fraud, abuse and misconduct -- and that whistle-blowers ""should never suffer reprisal or even the threat of reprisal for doing so."" Significantly, the letter quotes Senator Charles Grassley, Republican of Iowa, chairman and a co-founder of the Senate's Whistleblower Protection Caucus, who noted recently that whistle-blowers ""ought to be heard out and protected"" and ""we should always work to respect whistle-blowers' requests for confidentiality."" Members of the intelligence community, whether they are federal employees or government contractors, must follow the law in disclosing their reasonable belief of a violation of law, rule, regulation or an abuse of authority. They cannot avail themselves of whistle-blower channels available to other federal employees because they deal almost exclusively with classified information, the unauthorized disclosure of which could cause grave harm to our national security. It is for these reasons that Congress created a specific process where members of the intelligence community may disclose such information lawfully through an Office of Inspector General.

So when certain members of Congress attack a lawful whistle-blower, as our former client is, they jeopardize their own constitutional right to conduct oversight over the executive branch and intelligence-related matters. Rather than weakening the system, members of Congress should seek to strengthen it so they can be effective in their constitutionally mandated oversight role. That could include, but not be limited to, imposing penalties for exposing or intimidating lawful whistle-blowers and their attorneys, broadening the definition of whistle-blower retaliation beyond employment-related actions and creating a more direct path for intelligence community employees to report wrongdoing to Congress involving White House officials and even the president. We are ready to work with congressional members on both the left and the right to strengthen the system. We hope our former client's moral courage and personal integrity will inspire others to follow the law and speak up when they see something they reasonably believe to be wrong. All government leaders should encourage the process: Protecting whistle-blowers should never be a partisan activity. Lawful whistle-blowers should always -- always -- be protected from reprisal. That is the foundation of our democracy.","Future whistle-blowers must be persuaded that while there are always risks, the system can protect them.",9f5e838a-69aa-52a8-8444-0704087909cb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/01/opinion/01bakaj-zaid/01bakaj-zaid-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=77ff19cc38725ef5fe9898770bbfa1b2caccd1ebaa57cb7fd0b2e212f281baa3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A woman protesting outside a Donald Trump Jr, book promotion event on the UCLA campus in California last November.",9f5e838a-69aa-52a8-8444-0704087909cb,N24News/imgs/9f5e838a-69aa-52a8-8444-0704087909cb.jpg,11
Food,"Outdoor Oysters and Beer? Still on Ice, With Summer Nowhere in Sight",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/dining/seasonal-restaurants-coronavirus.html,"Outdoor Oysters and Beer? Still on Ice, With Summer Nowhere in Sight

The Sherman Zwicker, a 78-year-old wooden fishing schooner, returned to New York City at the end of March after spending the winter in dry dock in Connecticut, having parts of its hull replanked by shipwrights at the Mystic Seaport Museum. With some fresh paint, a new awning and a load of supplies, the schooner would be ready to cruise to Pier 25 in Hudson River Park, where every year since 2014 it has operated as an outdoor oyster bar called Grand Banks. The first customers of 2020 were supposed to have boarded on April 15, but the Sherman Zwicker is still docked in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Next to it is an older schooner that also serves as an oyster bar in warm weather; called Pilot, it was scheduled to start up again in Brooklyn Bridge Park on May 1. Alexander Pincus and his brother Miles own and run both restaurants along with Island Oyster, a nonfloating oyster bar on Governors Island they had meant to reopen the same day as Pilot. Other projects were in the works for later in the season, too, including a restaurant on a retired fireboat. Those plans were laid before Americans began dying of a powerfully contagious new disease. Now, like millions of other people whose way of making a living is temporarily banned, Alexander Pincus isn't sure what the future holds. He is at home in Brooklyn, recovering from what he calls ""a very bad"" respiratory illness that he believes was Covid-19, and wondering how long his savings will last.

Some of these businesses are fixtures of the warm-weather landscape -- the ice cream stands, seafood shacks, beer gardens, open-air taquerias. Others follow a more recent entrepreneurial model, selling niche products out of banged-together stalls or eye-catchingly painted trucks at outdoor markets, festivals and concerts. All of them depend on freedoms that are usually taken for granted but that the pandemic has placed in short supply, like the freedom to travel, the freedom to go to the beach and the freedom to stand in the hot sun eating out of paper cartons in the company of dozens of other people eating out of paper cartons.

Although many seasonal food businesses have a flyaway look, collectively they make a significant contribution to how people experience summer, and to the economy. After hitting a low point around February each year, the number of restaurant employees tends to peak in June and July, when dining areas spill out to patios and gardens, tourism surges and beach towns come alive. Each summer for the past seven years, restaurants in the United States have added more than half a million jobs, according to the National Restaurant Association. Nobody expects to see numbers like that in 2020. Chowder shacks that unlock their screen doors on Memorial Day weekend still have a chance to make their opening dates. But businesses that get off to an earlier start have already frozen new hiring. The Pincus brothers, who had plans to bring on 425 workers for their oyster bars over the next few months, have furloughed 13 of their 18 year-round employees. Big Mozz, a New York company that was expecting to serve about half a million pounds of pecorino- and parsley-flecked mozzarella sticks at seasonal events this year, had planned to hire 200 people.

Last April, for instance, a recent graduate of Rhode Island School of Design named Ruby Schechter introduced her business, the Better Pop, at the Smorgasburg outdoor food market in Williamsburg. She sold $6 ice pops made from whole fruit and kombucha frozen in a mold she designed herself that gives the pops a futuristic, modular shape. (It resembles a carton that the Jetsons might use for quail eggs.) The shape is meant to make it easier to bite off chunks of frozen fruit, but it also looks cool, and people walking around Smorgasburg with a Better Pop pop were always being asked what it was and where it came from. ""It was a huge success,"" Ms. Schechter said. By the end of the summer she was being hired to bring her pops to corporate events put on by Saks Fifth Avenue, Google, LinkedIn and other businesses. ""I made a lot of money in the first year, which for a lot of companies is very hard to do."" This year was supposed to be even better -- ""really huge,"" Ms. Schechter said. There would be Better Pop stalls at the Governors Ball and other outdoor festivals that look increasingly unlikely now. A collaboration with a fast-casual restaurant chain has been put on hold, she said.

The Better Pop had been scheduled to return to Smorgasburg last weekend, too, when its Brooklyn markets were supposed to reopen. They are on hiatus now, along with a year-round Los Angeles edition and a planned expansion of its World Trade Center market to two days a week from one. Many of Smorgasburg's nearly 200 vendors are hanging in limbo, according to Jonathan Butler, one of the market's founders. Most Smorgasburg stalls take in more than $2,000 a day, he said, while some go up to $5,000. Most hire from two to six people to help out. The total daily sales was $150,000 for each of the two Brooklyn markets and less for the Los Angeles and World Trade Center markets. While most vendors don't have the rent obligations that restaurant owners do, ""I suspect they're feeling a similar level of panic,"" he said. For many of the newer Smorgasburg vendors, ""the thing they're most qualified to do is go work in a restaurant. So it's pretty grim. They don't have a lot of prospects."" Some seasonal vendors live all year on their summertime income. Others say the money is nice, but isn't their first priority. Like many of the people who sell food at the Queens Night Market, an outdoor bazaar of foods from around the world that has materialized every Saturday night from April to October for the past five years, Hendra Lie does not support himself with cooking. Serving the Indonesian food of his childhood from his stall, Warung Jancook, satisfied other needs. ""The Queens Night Market is my passion,"" he said. ""I like to cook. I like to present myself and the culture through food that I created."" Hendra Lie, second from right, hopes to cook Indonesian food at the Queens Night Market again this year. Still, the exposure and encouragement stirred his ambitions. Before the coronavirus descended on Elmhurst, Queens, where he lives, he had been planning an Indonesian restaurant. Now, he isn't sure.

Seasonal businesses tend to be streamlined. They are built to go dormant and then reawaken on cue. Employees are usually lined up and waiting for opening day. Budgets run low. Everything is timed for the money to start circulating again in April and May. The only thing circulating this year is anxiety. Nobody knows when people will be free to move around again, or how long it will take for them to feel safe outside. ""A lot of us vendors are thinking about are how many people are going to show up to these social events,"" Ms. Schechter, the fruit pop vendor, said. ""How many people are still going to be scared, and not want to put themselves in situations where there's a lot of people?"" Against this fear, seasonal vendors hold on to hope that when the crowds do come back, they'll be ready for action. ""People do seem really excited about the prospect of getting outside again,"" Alexander Pincus of the Grand Banks oyster bar said. ""That's the light at the end of our tunnel. It's what keeps us going every day.""","Warm-weather food businesses are putting their plans, and many of their workers, on hold.",dfdc733e-c317-59a1-bb84-8baaa28ea60c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/08/dining/07virus-seasonal1/07virus-seasonal1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=e0727d1387074bfd28cf956027fff1e52a6be3aafb965739fba6443426643837&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Grand Banks, an oyster bar on a schooner in the Hudson River, will miss its projected opening date of April 15.",dfdc733e-c317-59a1-bb84-8baaa28ea60c,N24News/imgs/dfdc733e-c317-59a1-bb84-8baaa28ea60c.jpg,17
Movies,Female Composers Are Trying to Break Film's Sound Barrier,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/movies/female-film-composers.html,"Composers have been hired for two forthcoming blockbusters about warrior women -- ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" directed and co-written by Patty Jenkins, and ""Mulan,"" directed by Niki Caro from a screenplay by three women. The composers: Hans Zimmer and Harry Gregson-Williams. Both, plainly, dudes. More than just a missed opportunity to lend flinty female heroes a female musical voice, the announcements were simply the latest examples of women being sorely unheard in film music. A 2018 study by the University of Southern California revealed that for the top 100 fictional films at the box office every year from 2007 to 2017, only 16 female composers were hired, compared with more than 1,200 men. Another report, from the Center for the Study of Women in Television and Film, showed that of the top 250 films at the domestic box office in 2018, 94 percent were scored by men.

Karpman was instrumental in expanding the diversity of her branch's membership, which now includes the Russian composer Sofia Gubaidulina. Karpman also spearheaded the creation of a shortlist in the score category of the Academy Awards. ""Had we had a voted-upon shortlist last year, I think we would have more diversity,"" she said. Citing the composers behind ""Get Out"" and ""Mudbound,"" she added, ""I want to see Michael Abels and Tamar-kali on Oscar shortlists."" (Karpman spoke before the shortlist was announced in December. It includes Terence Blanchard's score for ""BlacKkKlansman"" -- his first Oscar nomination if he moves to the next round -- but, alas, no women.) Tamar-kali is one of several new voices in a persistently white male milieu. ""Mudbound,"" directed by Dee Rees, was the Brooklyn artist's first score, which she followed with the Netflix drama ""Come Sunday."" She's also reteaming with Rees for an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel ""The Last Thing He Wanted."" As an Afro-indigenous woman in the New York punk rock scene, she said, she was already used to being ""an outlier within the outliers."" ""It just kind of fuels your creativity,"" she explained. ""The ethos means even more to you, because you're practicing it every moment -- even in the pit, even at shows.""

Like a handful of other female artists, Tamar-kali wasn't pursuing film composition, but was commissioned after a director heard her work. Mica Levi, a British rocker from the band formerly known as Micachu and the Shapes, was nominated for an Oscar for ""Jackie,"" which followed her shivering, queasy breakout score for ""Under the Skin."" The Icelandic cellist-composer Hildur Gudnadottir was hired for ""Sicario: Day of the Soldado"" and the forthcoming ""Joker,"" starring Joaquin Phoenix -- two patently ""macho,"" big-budget features -- largely because of her experimental electronic solo work. ""People approach me looking for a specific type of sound, or feeling,"" Gudnadottir said. ""They don't come knocking on my door for, like, a John Williams score. So that also puts me in a really good position, because I'm normally allowed to be myself.""

All of this raises the question of why most studio features -- even female-centric no-brainers like the ""Ghostbusters"" reboot and ""Ocean's 8"" -- still go to men. The history of women scoring films isn't long. The pioneer was probably Germaine Tailleferre, a French composer who co-scored a travelogue in 1926. Thirty years later, the American Bebe Barron created the avant-garde electronic sound for ""Forbidden Planet"" with her husband, Louis. Wendy Carlos's seminal synthesizer album ""Switched-On Bach"" led to her collaborations with Stanley Kubrick on ""A Clockwork Orange"" and ""The Shining."" Angela Morley was an Oscar-nominated composer whose credits included the 1978 animated feature ""Watership Down"" and the TV series ""Dynasty"" and ""Dallas."" Shirley Walker was a pianist who helped Carmine Coppola realize his score for ""Apocalypse Now,"" and went on to shape scores by Elfman and Zimmer in the 1980s and '90s as an in-demand orchestrator. Both men, classically untrained, credit her as a teacher.

Walker, who died in 2006, also composed her own scores, notably ""Batman: The Animated Series,"" the ""Final Destination"" movies and the 2003 horror film ""Willard."" Yet she could never break into the top-tier movies she was helping men with. ""I don't think she got in the door for the same meetings that the guys would get,"" said Lolita Ritmanis, a composer who was mentored by Walker. ""I wouldn't say she was bitter. She was a fighter till the end."" The first woman to win an Oscar for best score was Rachel Portman, for ""Emma"" in 1996. (The only other woman to win that prize is Anne Dudley, for ""The Full Monty"" the next year.) The film industry, Portman said, ""tends to be quite cautious."" She added that directors feel more comfortable with composers who have ""done something really similar-sounding before -- which immediately makes it very difficult to break in. And also this feeling that there's safety if someone else has hired someone before, which I think is particularly hard for women.""

The women interviewed for this article offered a variety of reasons for the longstanding inequality: institutionalized sexism; a lack of precedents and female role models to inspire girls to go into the field; and the social conditioning of women to be selfless caretakers and not seize the spotlight. Increasingly, women are entering the profession, but are still outnumbered by men. The film scoring certificate program at the University of California, Los Angeles has produced 120 graduates since 2013, of which only 25 percent were female. Likewise, only a quarter of applicants to the film scoring graduate program at U.S.C. this year were female -- although the school invited seven women to join its 20-student program. Rachel Portman with her Oscar for ""Emma"" in 1996. She was the first woman to win for best score. Several workshops -- including the Sundance Institute Film Music Program, which has achieved gender parity the past two years, and the Ascap Film Scoring Workshop -- are trying to provide more women with real-world experience and access to the industry. Universal Pictures started its Film Music Composer Initiative to find talented women and people of color. Winning candidates are writing orchestral scores -- and running recording sessions at Abbey Road -- for shorts created by DreamWorks Animation. Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum scored the program's first short, ""Bird Karma."" She praised the initiative for providing opportunities, adding, ""That door has been very much shut for a lot of people.""

There are also new resources for support. The Alliance for Women Film Composers was founded in 2014, and now has close to 400 members. It has raised the visibility of women through concerts and advocacy work, and provides solidarity in a lonely profession with no formal union. ""It's a sisterhood, it's a resource,"" said Ritmanis, president of the alliance. ""And although we are very much competitors, we are also each others' cheerleaders."" ""I think because of the global awareness of women's rights, and #MeToo, and Time's Up and all these different movements,"" she added, ""there is an interest and a call to action"" among studios and decision makers. ""People call me wanting to meet and figure out what they can do, and I do think that there's a lot more opportunity for women to be part of the big audition process"" for major feature assignments. As there should be, given their talent, said Doreen Ringer-Ross, an executive in the film music division of Broadcast Music Inc., the performing rights organization which manages the catalogs of many of Hollywood's top composers. ""The job of a composer is to be really sensitive, is to interpret the emotion of things, musically,"" she said. ""And women are traditionally great at doing that."" Still, emerging composers face a double standard. Jesi Nelson has been apprenticing with several male composers as she develops her own career, and she's dealt with potential bosses commenting about her legs or musicians assuming that she's somebody's personal assistant when she's actually running a recording session. ""I do get angry, and sometimes I'm just like, what's the point?"" Nelson said.

Fashion & Style,"Veronica Webb, Overseer of Pizza Parties",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/12/fashion/veronica-webb-supermodel-actress-entrepreneur-pizza-party.html,"""It's not glamorous taking out the recycling,"" Veronica Webb said, as she carried a basket of plastic bottles and cardboard down the hall of her Upper West Side apartment. It was a Saturday evening in late October, and Ms. Webb, 51, a supermodel and actress who was a runway star in the 1990s, had a houseful of teenagers over to celebrate her daughter Leila's 14th birthday. Leila's stepfather, Chris Del Gatto, 46, herded the chattering gaggle into the elevator while his wife disappeared behind a door and reappeared empty-handed. The family was headed to Magnolia Bakery to pick up a birthday cake. For dinner, Leila wanted typical teenage fare: pizza, French fries and mozzarella sticks.

Outings like these are material for Ms. Webb's new website, WebbOnTheFly.com, which she recently started and where she doles out advice on motherhood, beauty, fashion and wellness. She has reteamed with her former modeling agent at Muse Management, where she joined its influencer division.

Among other things, she plans to give speeches. Ms. Webb was one of the first black models to be signed to a major beauty contract (Revlon), and next year she is teaching a course at New York University about branding in the fashion industry. At home, though, she empties the dishwasher as the family orders dinner. ""I don't want pizza,"" Ms. Webb said. ""I'll have French fries and red wine."" ""Why don't we get pieces so everyone gets what they want?"" Leila said. ""Let's get two pies,"" Mr. Del Gatto said. ""That's too much,"" Ms. Webb said. ""How about getting one pie? We are going to make mozzarella sticks.""

They finally agreed on two margherita pizzas and some slices for Leila. The teenagers sprawled on the couch, a tangle of arms and legs, and watched ""Thor"" while they waited for the pizza to arrive. Ms. Webb looked at Mr. Del Gatto. ""Do we want to make fries?"" she asked. ""It's already 8."" The couple had received an electric air fryer as a housewarming gift. It is the size of an industrial rice cooker, and neither had used it. Ms. Webb consulted Siri on her iPhone. Mr. Del Gatto looked at the instructions. Unlike a typical fryer, it uses only a small amount of oil. ""It's supposed to be health conscious,"" said Mr. Del Gatto, who appraises and sells fine jewelry. Molly, Ms. Webb's 12-year-old daughter, emerged from her upstairs bedroom, wearing a crimson cape. ""Chris, did you blunt my sword yet?"" she asked her stepfather. The plastic sword was part of the Little Red Riding Hood Halloween costume she bought online, but it was too sharp to play with. ""No,"" he said. ""I'm teaching you patience."" She asked her mother to straighten her hair. ""I'll do it in a minute, honey,"" Ms. Webb said. She was watching a video on her cellphone about how to make fried mozzarella sticks. Ms. Webb grew up in Detroit, the youngest of three daughters. ""My mother was an amazing baker,"" she said. ""She always made soups and stews."" Ms. Webb's favorite dish to cook is couscous royale, a lamb stew served over couscous. ""I'll call Azzedine, and he'll talk me through it,"" she said, referring to Azzedine Alaia, the fashion designer, whom she met in the late 1980s in Paris. ""Azzedine is like my dad.""

She turned and saw Molly with a pint-size glass. ""It's five minutes before dinner and you are having a full glass of lemonade?"" Ms. Webb said. ""No!"" She took the glass and poured most of the lemonade back into the bottle, leaving a healthy gulp for Molly.","The supermodel, actress and, now, web entrepreneur hosts a birthday party for her teenage daughter.",4a6d00b0-3eb3-57d8-8ee8-296b91c6983c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/fashion/13NIGHTOUT1-WEB/13NIGHTOUT1-WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=c7c887cd59ddbe0bf338b24ea92c81f970668ba4321d2da655f41b1f1806271f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Veronica Webb and her husband, Chris Del Gatto, with, from left, Molly Robb and Leila Robb (her daughters) and Grace Rutigliano and Charlotte Soiefer (friends of the daughters').",4a6d00b0-3eb3-57d8-8ee8-296b91c6983c,N24News/imgs/4a6d00b0-3eb3-57d8-8ee8-296b91c6983c.jpg,19
Fashion & Style,"9 to 5 Dressing, Updated for 2018",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/fashion/9-to-5-dressing-the-post-1970s-office.html,"As movie buffs already know, ""The Post,"" the Steven Spielberg journalism thriller starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, hits theaters in wide release on Jan. 12. Set in 1971, the film follows the Washington Post's first female publisher, Katharine Graham, and its editor Ben Bradlee as they grapple with the decision to publish excerpts from the Pentagon Papers. While Mrs. Graham's unshakable grit and hard-won success would not be easy to emulate, her wardrobe in the film, a veritable tribute to 1970s office wear, is easier to mine. And the pussy-bow blouses and A-line midi-skirts look startlingly fresh in 2018. Here, how to wear these retro staples.

With a smart A-line skirt and pussy-bow blouse, a white double-breasted blazer is promotion worthy. Worn with matching white pants and chunky platforms, it channels quite another '70s icon: Bianca Jagger (who most certainly never saw the inside of a cubicle).

The Ferragamo Vara pump has stood the test of time. Introduced in 1978, the polished shoe has the magic ability of going with practically everything, from frayed denim to a throwback skirt suit. These stacked-heel loafers in navy patent leather put a fashion-forward spin on the masculine style. Slip them on and walk straight up that corporate ladder.

Almost nothing is more versatile than a wrap dress. With stack-heel loafers and a structured blazer, this one has a retro vibe that works 9 to 5.

An easy way to earn those stripes (at least the sartorial variety) at the office. The bold color scheme keeps it from feeling dated.

Health,How Healthy Are You? G.O.P. Bill Would Help Employers Find Out,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/health/workplace-wellness-programs-health-genetic-data.html,"""We strongly oppose any legislation that would allow employers to inquire about employees' private genetic information or medical information unrelated to their ability to do their jobs, and to impose draconian penalties on employees who choose to keep that information private,"" a group of advocates, including AARP, the American Diabetes Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Epilepsy Foundation, the March of Dimes and others wrote in a letter this week to Ms. Foxx.

As wellness programs proliferate across the corporate landscape, workers are increasingly being asked by their companies to undergo health screenings and medical assessments. Employees can opt out of these programs, and personal information specific to a worker is not supposed to be shared directly with the company. The prohibition is aimed at preventing someone from being fired or otherwise discriminated against because of a serious medical condition.

The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has vigorously pursued legal action against some employers it claimed went too far and used these programs inappropriately, but the courts have largely been sympathetic to the employers' arguments. Companies also complained that the regulations were confusing, and the commission issued final rules in May aimed at addressing some of their concerns.

Companies defend the wellness programs, saying they keep workers healthier and help reduce insurance costs. But some studies have questioned the effectiveness of these initiatives.

Critics argue that workers are essentially being coerced into giving up private medical information, such as their weight, their blood pressure and whether they are at particular risk for cancer. Under the Affordable Care Act, employers can entice a worker by offering as much as a 30 percent reduction in insurance payments. Although the financial incentives offered have typically been lower, an employee who refused to participate could lose as much as thousands of dollars in savings.",The bill would also significantly increase the financial penalties for employees who do not join workplace wellness programs.,51e6c72e-e8b3-5ed9-97a8-6602fbed29b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/11/science/11GENESALT/11GENESALT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=73287d36c2bf2d94d6b4fdbbc0042b345638bea4e9d01a65f40f4f75f944f208&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A blood pressure test.

Sports,Soccer's Coming Storm,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/04/sports/soccer/premier-league-soccer-wages.html,"Sign up for Rory Smith's weekly newsletter on world soccer (and, for the foreseeable future, quite a few other topics) at nytimes.com/rory. At first glance, the problem is clear, and the problem is money. Soccer, at its rarefied heights, is awash with it: broadcasting deals and sponsorship agreements and corporate entertainment, all of it swilling through leagues and clubs, into the hands of players and executives and agents. Particularly in the Premier League, everyone has grown fat on it, and now that the supply has been cut off, nobody wants to go hungry. Weeks after games were canceled and the season was suspended because of the coronavirus pandemic, long after Barcelona's squad agreed to give up 70 percent of its salaries, long after Juventus players delayed their payment for months, players in England had still not agreed to defer or forfeit their salaries.

At the same time, just as in the United States and other countries, hundreds of thousands of people in the rest of the British economy were filing for unemployment benefits, just the first wave of the economic shock caused by the coronavirus and the shuttering of towns and cities across the world. At least four Premier League clubs, meanwhile, have moved to place many of their nonplaying staff on furlough: Norwich City, Newcastle United, Bournemouth and Tottenham Hotspur. Others will follow, perhaps including some of the richest in the game, teams that are planning to spend hundreds of millions of dollars in this summer's transfer market now taking advantage of government support programs to pay their employees.

From the outside, it is a faintly obscene situation. Soccer, of course, makes a convenient punching bag at times like this, a portrait in the attic for a society unwilling to confront its inequalities. Politicians, never slow to issue moral judgment on footballers, have raged at how out of touch they are, how spoiled, how greedy, how abominably obsessed by money. But the root of the problem is not the surfeit of money; that is merely a function of the real issue, which is the dearth of trust. The players do not trust that the clubs are not trying to make them shoulder the burden. The clubs do not trust that the players' agents -- and by extension the players -- will act honorably, in the common good. And, just as important, the clubs do not trust one another: hence the Premier League's edict that, whatever action is taken, it should be across the board. Even in normal times, these institutions eye one another with suspicion. They believe that their rivals will, in some way, attempt to use any situation to gain a competitive edge. They are not well suited to collective action. That lack of trust permeates the game. FIFA, as my colleague Tariq Panja reported this week, has plans to use some of its vast cash reserves as an emergency fund for clubs to dip into in their hour of need. Privately, though, officials worry that much of that money will simply vanish, lost as it percolates through national associations or is siphoned off by agents.

The same is true at UEFA. It does not entirely trust the leagues; the leagues do not trust each other; some of them do not trust their clubs. This is the ultimate consequence of the undiluted neoliberal thinking that has permeated soccer: the idea that all are out for themselves. That belief is so ingrained in the sport -- especially in England, where the Premier League has been built on the purest Thatcherism known to man -- that it cannot easily be set aside, even now, even at a time like this. (The contrast with Germany, where clubs are held to be community assets, is stark. There, players have sacrificed wages and clubs' money without giving the impression it is having to be clawed from their fingers.)

The immediate consequence of that, of course, is that soccer has an image problem. It will be remembered that the national game, in England, did not seem especially willing to do its part to help out the country in its hour of need. There have been gestures, of course, welcome ones, as I noted last week; individual clubs and players have done what they can to use their platforms for good. But from the outside, it looks a lot like as soon as money came into it, that changed. There is, though, a longer-term issue. No matter when the pandemic abates, no matter when life returns to something approaching normal, no matter when soccer comes back and no matter which season it is, there will be an economic cost, just as there will be in every other industry. Few clubs, even elite ones, are enormously profitable. (It has been striking how fragile such a lucrative ecosystem can be.) The loss of match-day revenue -- much less having to pay back a portion of television income -- will be enough to tip quite a few of them into the red. A few steps down from the game's aristocrats, the effects will be much more severe.

That means a contraction of the market: not just for transfer fees, but for player salaries and agents' commissions, too. Clubs will be able to spend less, and will be inclined to sell more, driving down prices. Players will not command the sorts of salaries they might have done. At some clubs, it is possible that players will need to take pay cuts, just to help the team absorb the blow. But this is a world, remember, where the players do not trust the clubs, the clubs do not trust the players, and the clubs do not trust one another, where everyone believes everyone else is out for himself, and so they must be, too. Players will be unwilling to suffer if they feel the clubs are passing the buck onto them. Clubs will be tempted to pay beyond their means in order to keep up with their rivals. For soccer, there is a second crisis, waiting just behind this one. The thought has occurred, in recent days, that perhaps March 2020 marked the end of soccer's golden era, the 25-year period when it was the biggest show on earth, a cultural phenomenon of unparalleled scale, an apparently bottomless pit of money and glamour. There was no trust, no unity, no collective spirit in times of plenty. We may be about to find out what happens in times of want.

I knew, as I was writing last week's reading suggestions, that I would later be furious at myself for forgetting great swaths of excellent soccer-related literature. Fortunately, many of you were on hand to jog my memory. There was a lot of well-earned love, in particular, for David Winner's ""Brilliant Orange,"" Sid Lowe's ""Fear and Loathing in La Liga"" and Joe McGinniss's ""Miracle of Castel di Sangro."" I'd readily add all of those to the list. I expected a few to mention ""Fever Pitch,"" and was not disappointed, but I was really pleased that someone else out there loves ""The Far Corner,"" Harry Pearson's wonderfully funny assessment of soccer in the North East of England, as much as I do. That would make fine lockdown reading, I think. Others suggested books that I had better add to my birthday list. I've never read Bill Buford's ""Among the Thugs,"" which feels like an oversight, while ""Fathers of Football,"" by Keith Baker, and Paul Watson's ""Up Pohnpei!"" -- this is a pun on an English television series of the 1970s, which I watched and loved as a child but I suspect has not aged well -- sound like the sorts of things I'd very much enjoy. Thanks for the suggestions: I'll do my best to read them, but (for toddler-related reasons) my reviews may take awhile.

An update on the singular/plural debate from Fred Helms, a retired historian (it never fails to amaze me just how educated our readership is; it's quite intimidating). ""I think the American use of the singular is as opposed to the plural are came about as a result of the Civil War,"" Fred wrote. ""Prior to the war Americans talked and wrote about the United States using the plural -- these United States 'are.' After the war common usage changed to the United States 'is.' Gradually that usage came to be applied to other groups such as sports teams."" That leads me on to Thomas Bodenberg, who knows exactly what we need now. ""A cultural anthropologist would have a field day dissecting and proffering the why of these differences,"" he wrote. Any volunteers? And both Richard Murray and Christopher Sousa fell into my trap of asking why Rugby League is so much better than Rugby Union. The former is 13 people running into each other constantly. The latter is 15 people, on each team, watching as one of their number boots the ball forward, and then waiting to find out which arcane rule defines what happens next, all the while being very polite about it. That is as neat a summary as I can offer. That's all for this week. All ideas, suggestions and book recommendations are welcome: askrory@nytimes.com. I'm on Twitter, of course, rather more than I should be. This week's Set Piece Menu was recorded before social distancing and involved a coconut cake, from memory. And you can tell everyone you know about how nice it is to get an email every Friday here.","Players who won't take pay cuts. Clubs seeking government handouts.

Sports,Henrik Lundqvist's Future Is Unknown After Rangers Buy Out His Contract,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/sports/hockey/henrik-lundqvist-rangers-buyout.html,"Henrik Lundqvist has been a prominent New York athlete over a sterling career with the Rangers, with 459 career wins and myriad philanthropic efforts to boot. Now, the end of his 15-year era is at hand as the Rangers announced Wednesday they would buy out the last season of his contract. Lundqvist finished his Rangers career by playing the first two games in their three-game defeat against Carolina in this summer's qualifying round. He had started only one of the team's last 19 regular-season games, and just four of their last 30 en route to a career-worst 10-12-3 record. His final appearance at Madison Square Garden was a five-save effort in relief of Igor Shesterkin in a 6-4 loss to the Devils on March 7, the last game at the Garden before the coronavirus led play to be suspended. His storied Rangers career also included winning the Vezina Trophy after the 2011-12 season and making 129 straight postseason starts through Game 2 against the Hurricanes.

""Few players have been as important to the Rangers franchise as Henrik Lundqvist, and we are incredibly grateful for all he has done for our organization,"" James L. Dolan, the executive chairman of MSG Sports, said in a statement. Lundqvist now becomes an unrestricted free agent with an uncertain future. With the buyout, he will receive over the next two years part of the remaining $5.5 million he was owed to finish a seven-year contract extension he signed in December 2013 which commenced in 2014-15. The buyout also gives the Rangers $3 million of additional salary cap space for 2020-21 and adds $1.5 million in dead cap space for 2021-22.

If Lundqvist does choose to continue playing, he joins a glut of free agent goaltenders on the market, including the Stanley Cup-winners Braden Holtby and Corey Crawford, plus Robin Lehner, Jimmy Howard and Anton Khudobin, who led the Dallas Stars to the 2020 Stanley Cup finals. The Rangers carried three goaltenders on their roster for part of the 2019-20 season, with Lundqvist, 38, alongside two emerging 24-year-olds. They have the rising star Shesterkin, who was 10-2-0 in his first N.H.L. season, and Alexandar Georgiev, whom they would still have to re-sign as a restricted free agent. The Rangers committed to a rebuild late in the 2017-18 season, to the point of sending a letter to fans. Lundqvist vowed to be part of the revamped roster despite his veteran status. Youth has become especially prevalent for the Rangers under Coach David Quinn, who was hired from Boston University in May 2018. And by trading defenseman Marc Staal, 33, to Detroit last Saturday, the Rangers made the roster even younger while creating needed salary cap space. Still, his No. 30 will surely be added to the Garden's rafters and his plaque almost a given to grace the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. Former coaches and teammates said his legacy of spectacular play under pressure and unyielding decency will live for generations.

When Lundqvist debuted in 2005, the Rangers had not made the playoffs since 1997 and had a new-look squad led by Jaromir Jagr, Michael Nylander and Martin Straka up front and Renney behind the bench. Expectations, though, were not particularly high. Yet the Rangers shocked the pundits that season. They had 44 wins and 100 points behind Jagr's franchise-record 54 goals and 123 points plus Lundqvist's stellar first-year performance in goal with a 2.24 goals against average and a 30-12-9 record. ""He commanded the net from his very first game,'' Renney said. ""Very composed, competitive and confident."" Kevin Weekes, the team's veteran goalie that season, remembers being instantly aware something special was percolating. ""From camp on, Hank was amazing,"" recalled Weekes, who is now the lead analyst with the N.H.L. Network after an 11-year career with seven teams including the Rangers, Islanders and Devils. ""And he looked so different -- the way he did his pads, the way he stood in the net, his stance and the way he attacked the puck. I knew he was going to be the guy."" Lundqvist had played five seasons for Frolunda in his native Sweden before joining the Rangers, who had selected him in the seventh round of the 2000 draft after 21 other goaltenders were selected.

Lundqvist could still reach 500 career wins and third place on the career list behind Brodeur (691) and Patrick Roy (551) if he continues his career elsewhere. He has played entirely in the shootout era, which means, unlike other goalies with 400 wins, he has no ties on his record. What comes next for Lundqvist is uncertain. ""You want to be where you are loved and celebrated where you are wanted,'' said Weekes, who recorded 14 wins at Lundqvist's backup in 2005-06. ""And that's what Hank has known for the majority of his career. He has been incredible for them.""","If he chooses to continue playing after 15 years in New York, Lundqvist, 38, will join a crowded goaltender market during this free agency period.",0270c6ef-d2d8-5047-bbbd-d8fa559c0548,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/25/sports/00nhl-lundqvist-web-1/00nhl-lundqvist-web-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=1e3c4bf80f6ed9e6dfc96f3e76acf71d2c6bf401a8c328c6fd07e2c831f202c6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Henrik Lundqvist started the Rangers' first two games in its qualifying round series against Carolina, extending his streak of playoff starts to 129 games before Igor Shesterkin took over in Game 3.",0270c6ef-d2d8-5047-bbbd-d8fa559c0548,N24News/imgs/0270c6ef-d2d8-5047-bbbd-d8fa559c0548.jpg,9
Your Money,Are Markets Efficient? Even the Supreme Court Is Weighing In,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/29/your-money/are-markets-efficient-even-the-supreme-court-is-weighing-in.html,"A fierce debate about an academic theory loomed over the Nobel in economic science for 2013. Last week, the Supreme Court enshrined that argument in jurisprudence, issuing a ruling that is likely to make it harder for investors to prevail in some big class-action lawsuits. The court's decision emerges from a debate that has been simmering among economists for decades. It flared up again last fall, after the Nobel committee announced that it was giving the 2013 prize to three economists with discordant views on a wonky notion known as the efficient-markets hypothesis. Its core tenet is that market prices embody all available information. That may seem a simple thought, but its implications are controversial, and the court's position has important repercussions. The court delved into this arcane issue during a busy week in which it issued a series of major decisions dealing with cellphone privacy, presidential recess appointments and broadcasters' copyrights in a dispute involving Aereo, the upstart television streaming service. It turned to the efficient-markets hypothesis in a case concerning asbestos liabilities of the oil services company Halliburton. The court rejected a broad challenge to class-action lawsuits contending securities fraud. But it added a major new hurdle for investors that could stop some class-action suits in their tracks by letting corporate defendants try to prove, at an early stage, that there was no connection at all between corporate misstatements and share prices -- and therefore no grounds for litigation.

The court justified this change by updating its notion of market efficiency, basing its interpretation partly on the views of Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist and a 2013 Nobel laureate. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. echoed Mr. Shiller when he said market prices usually reflect what's known about publicly traded companies -- but not always. In other words, the court said that while market prices contain a great deal of information, they are highly imperfect. The court used that distinction to make an important change in the class-action arena. From now on, companies facing class actions can try to show at an early stage that even if they've made misstatements, market prices were not affected. Until now, the courts had held that the efficient-markets hypothesis meant that such public statements automatically affected market prices, John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia law professor, said in an interview. ""The court ruling could make it easier for companies to get cases dismissed at an early stage,"" he said. ""And it is likely to make it much more expensive for plaintiffs -- for investors -- to file suit."" The argument about efficient markets re-emerged in October, when Mr. Shiller, along with Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen, both of the University of Chicago, won the Nobel. The Nobel committee initially finessed the economists' disagreements by citing their collective contributions to ""empirical analysis of asset prices."" But the divergent opinions among the economists are deep-seated, and Mr. Shiller addressed them last October in an Economic View column in The New York Times; Justice Roberts cited the column in his decision. Mr. Shiller wrote: ""Professor Fama is known as the father of the modern efficient-markets theory, which says financial prices efficiently incorporate all available information and are in that sense perfect. In contrast, I have argued that the theory makes little sense, except in fairly trivial ways.""

Mr. Shiller emphasized ""the enormous role of human error"" that has been documented by behavioral finance and the need to rein in market excesses through regulation. (In an interview, Mr. Fama expressed skepticism about Mr. Shiller's emphasis on the irrational, and said that while he preferred market solutions, regulatory action was often needed.) In court filings and oral arguments, Halliburton said debates like this demonstrated that economists no longer accept the efficient-markets hypothesis as gospel. Therefore, the company argued, the court should overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, that has allowed shareholders in publicly traded companies to form class-action groups based on the automatic assumption that significant misstatements caused share prices to fall. ""The economics have changed,"" Aaron M. Streett, Halliburton's lawyer, declared before the court. He said that many investors ""do not rely on the integrity of the market price whatsoever."" In the Supreme Court's decision, which sends the Halliburton case back to a lower court, Justice Roberts rejected these claims, quoting Mr. Shiller's column. It said: ""Of course, prices reflect available information."" Yet the court also accepted that market prices reflect information imperfectly at best, as Mr. Shiller and others have argued. Sometimes, for example, prices are much higher than can be justified by fundamental factors like corporate earnings and other public information. Sometimes, the court suggested, investors may have disregarded major misstatements by companies' executives. So the court occupied something of a middle ground, much as the Nobel committee did. Investors may continue to rely on the efficient-markets hypothesis in forming class-action groups, and may assume that share prices reflect corporate misstatements. But corporate defendants may now try to prove in specific cases that there was no connection between their statements and price movements. ""It's death by 1,000 cuts,"" Professor Coffee said. ""This isn't in itself a devastating blow to class-action plaintiffs. But it hurts, and it follows a number of other decisions that have limited plaintiffs' ability to sue successfully.""

It could have been much worse for plaintiffs, he observed. A concurring but critical opinion written by Justice Clarence Thomas and endorsed by Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Antonin Scalia, came down firmly on Halliburton's side. They said the economic profession's critique of the efficient-markets hypothesis has been so devastating that the precedent set by the Basic v. Levinson case should be overturned entirely. But the court as a whole approached efficient markets much as many long-term investors do. For many practical purposes, it's reasonable to assume that markets are efficient. That's why it's so hard to outperform them, and why so many people use low-cost index funds as their core portfolio holdings. Yet, in another sense, markets aren't efficient at all. They are prone to bouts of irrational exuberance, outright panic and other apparent aberrations that give wise traders an edge, and make claims of total efficiency hard to defend. Are markets efficient? It's all in the details, the court seemed to say. Often they are, but sometimes they're not, and investors need to prepare for the consequences.","In a case that delved into a much-debated academic theory, a ruling erects a new hurdle for investors to clear in some class-action lawsuits.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/29/business/29-STRA/29-STRA-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=431&w=600&s=1237f36c9a32bbf5b94027634104fc59dff225ce4ab778cbe21201d340e179ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The court's order was brief, provisional and unsigned, but it drew a furious dissent from the three female justices.",2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369,N24News/imgs/2811c86a-31be-5200-b3c9-3d40f8421369.jpg,21
Books,This Medical Memoir Reads Like a Detective Story,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/books/katherine-standefer-lightning-flowers.html,"I don't usually read with a pen in hand, but I circled, underlined and highlighted my way through LIGHTNING FLOWERS (Little, Brown Spark, 288 pp., $28), Katherine E. Standefer's sprawling memoir. If you've ever felt overwhelmed by a scary diagnosis, are tired of quarterbacking your own health care or simply need company while on hold with a doctor's office, this book will make you feel less alone. Pick it up and you will hear a human voice.

Standefer's foray into the medical establishment started simply enough. In 2009, after months of ignoring breathlessness and a hammering sensation in her chest, she was told she had long QT syndrome, a hereditary cardiac condition that leads to an irregular heartbeat. She writes, ""The inconsistency can go unnoticed -- a slight palpitation, maybe -- or it can cause the rhythm of the heart to spin out of control, unable to pump in the firm, organized manner that gets blood oxygenated and out to the limbs and organs. A heart that quivers instead of pumps fails to get oxygen to the brain.""

At the time, Standefer was a skiing instructor and climbing guide who lived with her sporty boyfriend in Jackson, Wyo. She'd let her health insurance lapse: ""The only sick people I knew were old."" One doctor prescribed beta-blockers and offhandedly advised her to give up any physical activity more strenuous than ""light tennis"" or golf. Another recommended a defibrillator; he had treated Standefer's sister for the same disorder. When a nurse warned that the surgery could cost as much as $180,000, Standefer understood ""that there was not going to be a way to salvage the life I'd been living."" She was an official citizen of Hospital Land, which is equal parts purgatory and labyrinth, with glimpses of humanity along the way.

""Lightning Flowers"" walks readers through the painstaking steps Standefer took to get her defibrillator. She moved to Boulder, Colo., where she established residency in hopes of getting assistance from the Colorado Indigent Care Program. She found a job with decent health insurance. She located an affordable apartment where she could recuperate. She lined up friends and family who would assist.

Of course, there were roadblocks and setbacks. Her recovery did not go smoothly; her boyfriend wasn't in it for the long haul. Standefer quickly developed a complicated relationship with the device nestled in a handmade pocket between her pectoral muscle and skin: ""There is no natural place in the body for a titanium box.""","A young woman's diagnosis is only the beginning of the mystery in ""Lightning Flowers."" As Katherine E. Standefer tried to make sense of her heart condition, her conscience sent her on a trip across the world.",cb6a88ac-c807-5900-b5c0-9dc0f6a89d81,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/22/books/review/22GroupText-STANDEFER/22GroupText-STANDEFER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3c1f166435d8a57a0b3461f3a0173e17dcf168ef020b8b5bf98b74054f0508f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""The thin, branched burns that uncoil from the heads and necks of lightning-strike victims are sometimes called lightning flowers,"" Standefer writes.

Technology,"When You Track Oreos, Exercise and Everything Else",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/15/technology/personaltech/track-your-life-app.html,"Tim Herrera, the editor of Smarter Living, at Kaffe 1668 South in Manhattan. ""If nutrition and fitness are your goal,"" he said, ""a food-tracking app like Lose It! or MyFitnessPal can be really helpful.""

How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Tim Herrera, editor of Smarter Living, an advice section of The Times, discussed the tech he's using. You give advice for people to live healthier, more fulfilling lives. What are the most important tech tools for doing your job? I'm a really big fan of tracking oneself to get a better view of the behaviors and habits we don't really think about, so a lot of the tech tools I use regularly at work or otherwise are software.

For example, I religiously use a mix of Trello and Google Keep to organize my work life around lists that make sense for me and how I structure my days. (Here are some tips on prioritizing your to-do lists.) I use LastPass to manage my passwords; Sleep Cycle to track my sleeping; Mint (and the apps for the banks I use) to track my finances; Lose It! to track my diet and exercise; Strava for when I run; Snapseed and Skitch to edit and annotate photos on the go; and Citi Bike to get around New York. The Voice Memos app on the iPhone is how I record interviews, and lately I've been using a Google Voice Typing trick to transcribe them.

On the gear side, I keep things pretty light. I use a MacBook Air and an iPhone 8 Plus for pretty much everything. I keep a wireless charger at my desk. (It's amazing. I highly recommend getting one.) An external battery is mandatory, of course, as is a great lap desk for when you're working from home. What's so great about these tools, and what could be better? It's so easy to lie to ourselves or bury our heads in the sand about things we'd like to be better at; like how it's easy to ignore your bank account unless it's payday. But being forced to write down or track everything about something and put it in an app -- for example, every dollar you spend -- gives insight into those behaviors and habits you can't really get otherwise. This was so crucial for me when I started dieting and exercising in 2016 and ended up losing about 35 pounds. I relentlessly tracked -- and still mostly do -- everything I ate and every time I exercised. The act of writing these things down with 100 percent accuracy is less important than having a way to objectively look at the data and what it says, rather than having to rely on your memory or feelings. For me, it was eye-opening to have a spot where I could see the nutritional information for the things I was putting into my body. It showed me that even though I thought I was doing an O.K. job at watching what I ate, I now had the written proof that said ... nope, still eating 30 Oreos a week. That same idea translates to finances, sleep schedules, productivity and time management at work, and so on.

So what tech products do you think people need to live healthier, more fulfilling lives? Depends! What are you trying to be better at? I think most people could probably benefit from a budgeting system. (Here are a few ideas.) If nutrition and fitness are your goal, a food-tracking app like Lose It! or MyFitnessPal can be really helpful (as long as you don't obsess over calories, which is a poor way to measure overall nutrition and health).

The idea is that the hyper-rapid motions of the buffer loosen tight muscles, reducing soreness and speeding up recovery. If that sounds vaguely familiar, you might have come across the $600 TheraGun, a power drill-like device a bunch of professional athletes and fitness-focused celebrities are using. Unlike the Black and Decker buffer, the TheraGun is designed for use on human muscles and not to wax the hood of your car. But save your money: The buffer is $30 on Amazon. Should people be using less tech to live smarter lives? I love this question because the default solution to ""Is unplugging from technology the key to happiness?"" has become such a vehement, unwavering yes. And I don't agree with that! I get a lot of happiness from scrolling through Instagram for 20 minutes when I first wake up, and I don't think it's inherently bad to rely on things like automation tools or virtual assistants. (Siri essentially replaced my short-term memory years ago.)

So when we talk about unplugging, I think what we're really talking about is structuring our lives in ways that allow technology to serve us, rather than the other way around. For example, an idea I hear from readers and other writers constantly is how to unplug when you're on vacation -- live in the moment rather than living on your smartphone. But there's research that says taking photos makes ""people more engaged with experiences, leading them to enjoy positive events more than people who didn't take pictures."" So here, the common wisdom -- enjoy your vacation more by completely unplugging! -- is, in a way, contradicted by the research. Should you plan for a less fun vacation because it would make for better Instagram stories? You do you! But the assumption that we can be truly happy only if we unplug is one that adds stress to our lives because it's yet another thing we have to worry about: ""Did I unplug enough today?""","Tim Herrera, editor of The New York Times's Smarter Living section, does not believe the answer to happiness is less technology. Here's why.",820ec8d7-e356-57c5-ba4d-00854712ab6f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/16/business/16TECHUSING02/16TECHUSING02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9bab0a413e87cf6c67556a5cf0c08ff9c00625a7624b0168fe00ff5edbe27c95&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tim Herrera, the editor of Smarter Living, at Kaffe 1668 South in Manhattan. &ldquo;If nutrition and fitness are your goal,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a food-tracking app like Lose It! or MyFitnessPal can be really helpful.&rdquo;",820ec8d7-e356-57c5-ba4d-00854712ab6f,N24News/imgs/820ec8d7-e356-57c5-ba4d-00854712ab6f.jpg,20
Global Business,"In Ireland, a Picture of the High Cost of Austerity",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/business/global/29austerity.html,"DUBLIN  As Europe's major economies focus on belt-tightening, they are following the path of Ireland. But the once thriving nation is struggling, with no sign of a rapid turnaround in sight. Nearly two years ago, an economic collapse forced Ireland to cut public spending and raise taxes, the type of austerity measures that financial markets are now pressing on most advanced industrial nations. ""When our public finance situation blew wide open, the dominant consideration was ensuring that there was international investor confidence in Ireland so we could continue to borrow,"" said Alan Barrett, chief economist at the Economic and Social Research Institute of Ireland. ""A lot of the argument was, 'Let's get this over with quickly.' "" Rather than being rewarded for its actions, though, Ireland is being penalized. Its downturn has certainly been sharper than if the government had spent more to keep people working. Lacking stimulus money, the Irish economy shrank 7.1 percent last year and remains in recession.

Joblessness in this country of 4.5 million is above 13 percent, and the ranks of the long-term unemployed  those out of work for a year or more  have more than doubled, to 5.3 percent. Now, the Irish are being warned of more pain to come. ""The facts are that there is no easy way to cut deficits,"" Prime Minister Brian Cowen said in an interview. ""Those who claim there's an easier way or a soft option  that's not the real world."" Despite its strenuous efforts, Ireland has been thrust into the same ignominious category as Portugal, Italy, Greece and Spain. It now pays a hefty three percentage points more than Germany on its benchmark bonds, in part because investors fear that the austerity program, by retarding growth and so far failing to reduce borrowing, will make it harder for Dublin to pay its bills rather than easier. Other European nations, including Britain and Germany, are following Ireland's lead, arguing that the only way to restore growth is to convince investors and their own people that government borrowing will shrink. The Group of 20 leaders set that in writing this weekend, vowing to make deficit reduction the top priority despite warnings from President Obama that too much austerity could choke a global recovery and warnings from a few economists about the possibility of a much sharper 1930s style downturn.

""Europe is in a tough bind,"" said Kenneth S. Rogoff, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and now a Harvard professor. ""If you want to escape default, the Irish path is the only way to go. But the Ireland experience points to the profound challenges that the current strategy implies."" Politicians here have raised taxes and cut salaries for nurses, professors and other public workers by up to 20 percent. About 30 billion euros ($37 billion) is being poured into zombie banks like Anglo Irish, which was nationalized after lavishing loans on developers. The budget went from surpluses in 2006 and 2007 to a staggering deficit of 14.3 percent of gross domestic product last year  worse than Greece. It continues to deteriorate. Drained of cash after an American-style housing boom went bust, Ireland has had to borrow billions; its once ultralow debt could rise to 77 percent of G.D.P. this year. ""Everybody's feeling quite sick at what happened because things were going so well for Ireland,"" said Patrick Honohan, the Irish central bank governor. ""But we don't have the flexibility to do a spending stimulus now. There's no one who is even arguing for it."" Mr. Honohan predicts growth could revive to a rate of about 3 percent by 2012. But that may be optimistic: Ireland, as one of the 16 nations in Europe that has adopted the euro as its common currency, is trying to shrink the deficit to 3 percent of G.D.P. by 2014, a commitment that could weaken its hopes for recovery.
* The head of Instagram agrees to testify as Congress probes the app's effects on young people.
* Today in On Tech: A fix-it job for government tech. These troubles sting many Irish, given the head start Ireland has on most members of the euro club. Its labor market is one of Europe's most open and dynamic. After its last major recession in the 1980s, it lured knowledge-based multinationals like Intel and Microsoft  and now Facebook and Linked-In  with a 12.5 percent tax rate, giving Ireland one of the most export-dependent economies in the world.

Turning statistics into jobs, however, will be a herculean task. ""Exports alone don't drive a significant number of jobs,"" said Paul Duffy, a vice president at Pfizer in Ireland. Wage cuts were easier to impose here because people remembered that leaders moved too slowly to overcome Ireland's last recession. This time, Mr. Cowen struck accords swiftly with labor unions, which agreed that protests like those in Greece would only delay a recovery. But pay cuts have spooked consumers into saving, weighing on the prospects for job creation and economic recovery. And after a decade-long boom that encouraged many from the previous years of diaspora to return, the country is facing a new threat: business leaders say thousands of skilled young Irish are now moving out, raising fears of a brain drain. David Stronge returned to Dublin in 2006 from an architecture job in Britain. ""I wanted to come back here and get a piece of this action,"" he said. ""And I did for about a year. But then it started to tank."" He moved to reinvent himself, returning to school with thousands of other Irish, in hopes that a higher degree would lead to better prospects. Mr. Stronge plans to seek alternative energy jobs in Britain once he gets his master's degree in August. ""Ireland isn't going to spend on infrastructure probably for another 10 to 15 years,"" he said. ""So you have to go to where the opportunities are.""

At the D Cafe, a sandwich shop facing a stretch of empty buildings in Dublin's Docklands enclave, even that dream seems impossible. ""If you're self-employed and lose your job, you're entitled to nothing, not even the dole,"" said Debbie, the owner, who would only give her first name. She transformed her convenience store into a deli when Liam Carroll, a property baron, threw up the nearby developments. But the tenants never came, and her business evaporated. ""It's so destroying,"" she said, gazing out the window. ""We all live day by day, and we don't know when it will ever pick up."" Signs of the decline encrust Dublin's streets. Boisterous crowds still mash onto the cobbles of Temple Bar. Yet farther out, ""To Let"" posters obscure the hollowed shells of once-vibrant cafes and clothing shops. Fifteen minutes north of the city center, hulks of empty buildings form stark symbols of why Ireland must now hunker down. At Elm Park, a soaring industrial and residential complex, 700 employees of the German insurer Allianz are the lone occupants of a space designed for thousands. In the impoverished Ballymun neighborhood, developers began razing slums to make way for new low-income housing. Halfway through the project, the financing dried up, leaving some residents to languish in graffiti-covered concrete skeletons. ""Welcome to Hell,"" read one of the tamest messages. Now the government is debating whether to demolish developments it inherited from the banks it nationalized, and restore them to green pasture.","After adopting austerity measures two years ago, the economic downturn has only grown worse.",1f0133e4-a777-56d3-9452-9add2f7dee98,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/06/29/business/global/29austerity-span/29austerity-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=ae5dfb1d1f233e70e3f10865a51d39b950cdd470bdca4a9fbadea9aef15d49bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The planned headquarters of the now nationalized Anglo Irish Bank along the North Quays of Dublin's docklands.

Opinion,"Leftists and Moderates, Stop Fighting. You Need One Another.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/16/opinion/leftists-moderates-democratic-party.html,"But most candidates who endorsed those initiatives were in safer districts than those who didn't. When moderate Democrats like Conor Lamb and Abigail Spanberger say that left-wing slogans are poisonous in their communities, people who don't live in those communities should take them seriously.

Left-wing populists often believe that there's a silent majority who agree with them, if only they can be organized to go to the polls. If that were true, though, an election with record high turnout should have been much better for progressives. Instead, 2020 was a reminder of something most older liberals long ago had to come to terms with: The voters who live in the places that determine political control in this country tend to be more conservative than we are.

Yet that doesn't mean that the Democratic Party doesn't need the left. Leaders like Bernie Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez were loyal soldiers in this election. After the primaries, they put aside their disappointment to rally voters whom Joe Biden might not have reached. One analysis showed that voting by young people was up 8 percent in 2020, and after the coronavirus, the issues young Biden voters cared about most were racism and climate change. The Democratic Party can't afford to alienate the people inspired by Sanders and the Squad.

The Democrats' loss in 2004 was devastating, but recovering from it didn't mean moving right. At the time, even civil unions for gay couples were controversial -- the Ohio ballot initiative was one of several that banned them along with same-sex marriage. Agitation for marriage equality turned support for such unions into the moderate liberal position, then into the centrist position. Then marriage equality became the law of the land.

Similarly, the Green New Deal made a climate plan like Biden's, the most ambitious ever proposed by a major party presidential nominee, look moderate. Calls to defund the police are unpopular, but the slogan has already made other reforms -- like changing the law to make it easier to hold police officers liable for misconduct -- seem centrist and practical.

Moderates need radicals to expand their scope for action. Radicals need moderates to wield power in a giant heterogenous country with sclerotic institutions and deep wells of reaction. Neither camp could have defeated Donald Trump on its own. It's frustrating now, as it was heartbreaking in 2004, that revanchist Republicans retain such a hold on America. But that's all the more reason for Democrats to stop their counterproductive sniping and work together to beat them.","In the Democratic civil war, both sides are partly right.",1f121859-9bff-5f1d-9ec5-e9f99ca2d91e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/16/opinion/16goldberg-2/16goldberg-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c3525972c973c5ca2512e3b99775a85f029e3ca6f2cac64ff66d2c55ddcebc9a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bernie Sanders supporters in Michigan in March.

Books,"A Son's Memoir of His Father's Radical Beliefs, Pursuit by the F.B.I. and Ardent Love for America",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/28/books/review/a-good-american-family-david-maraniss.html,"""Think of this story as a wheel,"" David Maraniss writes in an author's note at the beginning of his new book, ""A Good American Family."" ""The hearing in Room 740 is the hub where all the spokes connect."" Room 740 in Detroit's Federal Building was where Maraniss's father, Elliott, was summoned to appear before the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) one day in 1952, to answer charges that he was a member of the Communist Party. Simply being subpoenaed to appear had already cost Elliott his job, and his refusal to cooperate with the committee's questions would force him into years of desperate struggle to keep his family afloat. Elliott Maraniss was no atomic spy or government mole. He was a rewrite man at The Detroit Times, a World War II vet with a wife and three kids. HUAC had come to Detroit hoping to find communists in the United Auto Workers, a powerful liberal institution; people such as Elliott and his wife's brother, Bob Cummins, were just ""collateral damage,"" expected to make ""a few acts of repentance and contrition"" -- bow their heads and name names of old friends and comrades in the ongoing theater of the Red scare. If they didn't, they were dismissed after a brief interrogation with their lives in tatters. Elliott was not even permitted to read a prepared statement, though he was allowed to file it with the committee. Now, David Maraniss, in his ""long overdue attempt to understand what had happened to my father and our family and the country during what has come to be known as the McCarthy era,"" has unearthed that statement, and that moment. A winner of two Pulitzer Prizes in journalism and one of our most talented biographers and historians, Maraniss has used his prodigious research skills to produce a story that leaves one aching with its poignancy, its finely wrought sense of what was lost, both in his home and in our nation. It is at the same time a book that, like his family, never gives in to self-pity but remains remarkably balanced, forthright and unwavering in its search for the truth.

David's father was ""a liberal but undogmatic optimist,"" whose mantra was ""It could be worse."" He loved baseball and literature and funny songs; he once wrote a column under the moniker ""the Ol' Railbird""; and he had an abiding passion for nearly everything to do with the American heartland. He was, his son tells us, a brilliant newspaperman but also a constant ""force for good ... not only in my life and those of my siblings,"" but also in the lives of everyone he knew.

""I can appreciate his motivations, but I am confounded by his reasoning and his choices,"" Maraniss confesses. Elliott was the son of Jewish immigrants from Odessa and Latvia, a Boy Scout who grew up in Coney Island, an outstanding student and editor of the school paper at Abraham Lincoln High School -- a place almost painful to behold in its glowing idealism and dedication to learning, even in the midst of the Depression. A fellow student was Arthur Miller, whose own encounters with communism and the Red scare are another ""spoke"" connected to Room 740. Like Miller, Elliott went on to the University of Michigan, then ""in one of its own golden periods"" of scholarship, where he discovered his great love for the Midwest. He also encountered a key influence on his political development: 17-year-old Mary Cummins, a wisp of a girl with strawberry blond hair and deeply held radical convictions. The Cumminses were another remarkable American family, originally dirt-poor Kansas homesteaders living in a one-room dugout cut out of a hillside. Mary's father was a civil engineer who couldn't afford to finish his degree, but made enough money to drive a Cadillac and send his five children to college. The courtship of Elliott and Mary included strolls through Ann Arbor to gaze at a ""little blue house on Stadium Boulevard"" they dreamed of owning one day. Throughout their long marriage Mary insisted on buying the homes the family lived in -- strange behavior for an avowed communist. By 1939, as editorial director of The Michigan Daily, Elliott was defending the monstrous Stalin-Hitler pact that triggered World War II -- a stance that outraged and mystified many of his readers and friends, as well as his son, who calls it one of Elliott's ""indefensible positions."" When the war reached the United States, Stalin was back on the side of the Allies and both Maranisses threw themselves into the struggle. Elliott enlisted, while Mary helped build B-17s, and advocated for civil rights at her plant.

Rising to the rank of captain, Elliott was put in charge of a black salvage-and-repair company in the still segregated Army, arriving in Okinawa in July 1945, just after the terrible battle there. He excelled in his position, and the experience seemed to fill him with patriotic ardor. He wrote passionately to his wife about Franklin Delano Roosevelt, General MacArthur and especially Dwight Eisenhower, whom he would later admit to having voted for in 1952. He always harbored, it seemed, a desire to belong to a wider America, even as he saw its shortcomings. Unbeknown to Elliott, though, his assignment to command black troops was the end result of a desire by military intelligence, wary of his ""communistic"" tendencies, to exclude him from sensitive work while in the Army. Before his file was finally sealed, some 14 F.B.I. agents would interview 39 ""confidential informants"" about him. Their investigation would culminate in Room 740, but it would not end there. Even after HUAC had finished with him, the F.B.I. sent agents to interview Elliott's employers whenever he got a job, knowing it would likely cost him the position. The consequence was a series of agonizing sojourns back and forth across the country, as Elliott sought to find and keep gainful employment, badly straining his family and his nerves. ""A Good American Family"" is intercut with Maraniss's deep dives into the lives and backgrounds of all those other ""spokes,"" before, during and after the hearing in Room 740 -- an effort to explore one congressman's amazement that even some communists hailed from ""good American families."" Here are his father's radical friends who went to fight (and die) in Spain, along with his lawyer, fellow witnesses, the professional informer -- a five-foot grandmother and high school dropout -- who had ratted out Elliott, along with the prosecutor and leading inquisitors on the committee. Maraniss is able to spare some sympathy for the corrupt, drunken Democratic chairman of HUAC at the time, Representative John Stephens Wood, an inveterate racist with an appalling secret in his past -- whose society wife would have little to do with him after she discovered his Cherokee ancestry. This is, in the end, a fascinating confluence of America, and if the story drags in places -- we don't really need to know that there were 17,000 varieties of American apple by 1905 -- more often one is bowled over by the vibrancy of that vanished nation. It's a world where David's sister listens to a new song called ""Shake, Rattle and Roll,"" and the family watches mesmerized as exquisite lines of Detroit cars appear every summer. Elliott's wanderings take him to an Iowa newspaper that grew out of a strike by union typographers. Later, he sees his revered new publisher, William T. Evjue of The Capital Times, in Madison, talking and laughing in his office with Carl Sandburg and Frank Lloyd Wright. Did we ever live in such an America? Did we just dream it? After a long travail, Elliott and Mary Maraniss and their children would come through, buoyed by their unflagging optimism and faith. (Remarkably, the book's cover photo, of the Maranisses posing in front of the Statue of Liberty, was taken after Elliott's ordeal in Room 740.) For all of Maraniss's research, a mystery remains at the heart of ""A Good American Family"": Just what were his parents, and especially his father, doing in the Communist Party in the first place? This is a question Maraniss cannot answer, because his parents, for one reason or another -- shame? embarrassment? an effort to spare their children? -- rarely spoke of it. About the furthest his father would go was to admit that he had been ""stubborn in his ignorance about the horrors of the Soviet Union."" But this gives us little insight into how this great American spirit ended up stuffing himself into a closet of dreary Russian dogma.

Media,New Netflix Ratings Confirm 'Stranger Things' Is a Hit,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/02/business/media/stranger-things-nielsen-ratings.html,"Nielsen's new Netflix ratings service has its first public results, and they confirm what a lot of people in the TV industry felt but didn't know for sure: ""Stranger Things"" is a hit.

On Thursday, Nielsen released ratings for all nine episodes of the second season of the spooky thriller, which was made available on Netflix on Oct. 27.

According to the data, the first episode of ""Stranger Things"" was watched by 15.8 million people within the first three days.

How does that compare to three-day ratings for other top shows? Well, 15 million people watched the premiere episode of the most recent season of ""The Walking Dead,"" the biggest hit on cable; the first episode of NBC's ""This Is Us"" was watched by 17.8 million people; and the premiere episode of the latest season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" was watched by 22 million people. The season finale of HBO's ""Game of Thrones"" had 14.8 million viewers within three days of its broadcast; the premium cable network said that more than 30 million people watched each episode this past season once streaming numbers were factored in.","Almost 16 million people watched the first episode of the new season within three days, on par with the audience for some of broadcast TV's most popular shows.",ea28b224-ea4a-5c16-8332-d170cf309d44,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/03/business/03NETFLIX1/03NETFLIX1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=9c3a7f23a5ad30f70fa5487e32f14d2a0832b554d10b38b1736c9ed7c1649788&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Almost 16 million people watched the premiere episode of the second season of ""Stranger Things"" within three days, Nielsen reported.

Art & Design,"Venice Is a Stage for Damien Hirst's 'Treasures' (and a Biennale, Too)",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/arts/damien-hirst-venice-biennale.html,"VENICE -- Damien Hirst's ""Treasures From the Wreck of the Unbelievable"" is the most talked-about art show on earth. And all of it is for sale. The numbers boggle. Two museums; 54,000 square feet of exhibition space; 189 artworks, including more than 100 sculptures (one of them almost 60 feet high); 21 cabinets filled with smaller objects. Occupying the Punta della Dogana and the Palazzo Grassi, museums run by the French billionaire Francois Pinault's foundation, until Dec. 3, this privately financed exhibition purports to display artifacts that were once owned by the second-century collector Cif Amotan II and that have been salvaged, at vast expense, from the depths of the Indian Ocean. Mr. Hirst told the BBC that he had sunk ""probably more"" than 50 million pounds, or about $64.5 million, of his own money into the project. The visitor soon discovers -- maybe when seeing a coral-encrusted bronze self-portrait of the artist as a collector holding Mickey Mouse by the hand -- that the shipwreck is an elaborate shaggy dog story. ""Treasures"" is Mr. Hirst's latest body of work that aims to astound with the scale of its ambition and commercial success, like his $200 million ""Beautiful Inside My Head Forever"" auction at Sotheby's in 2008.

That the latest gigantic selling exhibition has been timed to coincide with the 57th Venice Biennale underlines the city's transformation every two years into the world's biggest art fair, as well as a must-see overview of the latest currents in contemporary art. Tailoring the exhibition to the trophy-hunting mentality of wealthy collectors, most of the major sculptures in the show are available in three versions: Coral (as if just retrieved from the sea), Treasure (as if just restored) and Copy (like a museum reproduction), each made in an edition of three, with two extra reserved for the artist. No real coral is used in the exhibition. The bronzes were cast by the Pangolin Editions foundry in western England, and the marbles carved in the Carrara region of Italy. The largest bronzes are priced at more than $5 million; a 4-foot-long white marble ""Sphinx"" in the Copy format is $1.5 million. Mr. Hirst's showmanship and chutzpah have turned this extravaganza of ""post-truth"" art into one of the great love-it-or-hate-it exhibitions of recent years. ""It's virtuosity and a big workshop,"" said Susanne Titz, director of the Abteiberg Museum in Monchengladbach, Germany. ""He's supersmart, but it is cynical."" Critical opinion of the show is divided, but has ""Treasures"" drawn enough buyers to become a commercial success? Francois Odermatt, a collector from Montreal, is one such customer.

""It's a fantasy; the ideas are brilliantly audacious,"" said Mr. Odermatt, who, like others, bought works after being shown images on an iPad by Mr. Hirst's dealers. Mr. Odermatt said he paid about $2 million for a color-patinated Coral version of ""The Diver,"" a 16-foot-high bronze sculpture inspired by a Francis Bacon painting, now on display at the Punta della Dogana. He said he had also tried to buy two other sculptures, but that the editions of those pieces had already been bought. Mr. Hirst's dealers, Gagosian and White Cube, have declined to comment on sales. Mr. Hirst's blockbuster show is just one of a number of events in Venice looking to gain the attention -- and perhaps open the wallets -- of the thousands of collectors, curators and museum directors who flock to the Biennale, which runs through Nov. 26. Near the Palazzo Grassi, in the church of San Samuele, the Calgary, Alberta, gallery Trepanier Baer and the curator Michael Short are presenting ""Ask Your Body,"" new and recent sculptures by the Canadian artist Evan Penny. One of the many ""unofficial"" collateral shows in Venice, ""Ask Your Body"" features hyper-realistic pigmented silicone imaginings of the human body in varying states of decline and distress. The life-size sculpture ""Marsyas,"" informed by a celebrated Titian painting, is priced at $275,000. ""We're happy our neighbor is Damien,"" said Yves Trepanier, the gallery's founder, adding that the works of Mr. Penny and Mr. Hirst ""play off each other in interesting ways.""

On Tuesday, the London dealer Victoria Miro staked a more permanent claim in Venice, opening a gallery there with a show of 22 works on paper by Chris Ofili, the artist who represented Britain at the 2003 Venice Biennale. Ms. Miro has taken over the former Capricorno Gallery in the San Marco district from her friend Bruna Aickelin, now in her 90s. In its heyday, the small space mounted exhibitions by major 20th-century artists, including Lucio Fontana and Robert Rauschenberg.

Is it counterintuitive for a major international gallery to open a branch in a city as underpopulated and overtouristed as Venice? ""Artists love coming here,"" Ms. Miro said, ""and they're queuing up to exhibit in this space. The art world is so global now."" Venice's alternating art and architecture biennales don't just draw artists, she said. ""People do come to the shows."" Titled ""Poolside Magic,"" the inaugural show at Victoria Miro Venice consists of vibrantly colored mixed-media drawings that evoke the exotic atmosphere of Trinidad, where Mr. Ofili lives and works. Prices range from about $50,000 to $100,000. The market is more discreet at the Biennale itself, but collectors who learn the codes are aware that there is plenty for sale. ""This says 'call me,' "" Alain Servais, a collector in Brussels, said on Wednesday at the ""Viva Arte Viva"" exhibition in the Central Pavilion in the Giardini. Mr. Servais was pointing to a label with the telltale combination of ""Courtesy of the artist"" and the name of a sponsoring commercial gallery.

""Pretty well everything is for sale here,"" Mr. Servais added. Unlike at a mainstream art fair, curation -- this year in the hands of Christine Macel -- rather than commerce is the prime consideration of the Venice Biennale. Ms. Macel invited 120 artists to contribute to her main group show at the Giardini and the Arsenale, but with a budget of 13 million euros (about $14.2 million), the Biennale relies on dealers to fund these presentations. The African-American artist Senga Nengudi was among 40 selected for the Giardini component of ""Viva Arte Viva."" Best known for her pantyhose sculptures from the 1970s, Ms. Nengudi, 73, is showing a new installation and wall pieces combining industrial metal with her trademark pantyhose medium. These were priced ""on request"" at about $120,000 to $250,000. ""This is intellectually and curatorially driven,"" said Thomas Erben, a New York gallerist who represents Ms. Nengudi in collaboration with the international dealership Levy Gorvy. ""She was invited by the curator. The Biennale is a prestigious event that will give her global exposure. Sales help recover the costs."" Mr. Erben said he was confident that the works would sell to museums. Martin Bethenod, director of the Venice museums hosting the Hirst show, said that there was something appropriate about ""Treasures"" being at the Punta della Dogana, a former customs house. Venice has always been a city of art and trade. In 2017, the two are more closely entwined than ever.","The artist's blockbuster show aims to open the wallets of collectors, curators and museum directors.

Opinion,Why Is Trump Gutting Regulations That Save Lives?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/17/opinion/coronavirus-trump-regulations.html,"Mr. Sunstein was administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration.



Since Jan. 30, 2017, the Trump administration's approach to federal regulation has been defined by a simple requirement: ""one in, two out."" The basic idea, set out in one of President Trump's first executive orders, is that whenever a federal agency issues one regulation, it has to take at least two regulations away -- and produce an incremental cost, on the private sector, of zero. The idea was absurd from the very start. It was profoundly demoralizing to experts in federal agencies, who know a lot about science and who have plenty of good ideas about how to protect public health and safety. But its absurdity has been put in a whole new light by the Covid-19 pandemic, which demonstrates that the regulatory state is no enemy of the people -- and that smart safeguards, designed by specialists, save lives. It is true that to many people, the one-in, two-out idea has a lot of intuitive appeal. For one thing, it instructs regulators -- at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, the Department of Health and Human Services and elsewhere -- to get rid of outmoded or dumb regulations.

But there is a subtler point. Mr. Trump clearly wanted to slow the issuance of new regulations. The one-in, two-out principle is well suited to achieving that goal. If agency heads know that they have to eliminate two regulations for every one they issue, they have a strong disincentive to issue new regulations. What if eliminating two regulations is unlawful? What if it turns out to be tough to find two old regulations, equal in cost to the new one, that really don't make sense? Since 2017, the one-in, two-out principle seems to have done just what it was intended to do. A report from the Office of Management and Budget, issued late last year, found that the total costs of federal regulations in 2018 and 2019 were spectacularly low -- the lowest, in fact, going all the way back to 2001. (Any official report should, of course, be taken with many grains of salt, but the actual numbers -- here for costs and benefits representing fiscal years -- are produced by civil servants, not political appointees, and they provide a valuable picture of differences across administrations.) Under President Bill Clinton, for example, the costs of regulation were in the vicinity of $7 billion in the 2005 fiscal year. Under President George W. Bush, they were around $14 billion in the 2007 fiscal year. Under President Barack Obama, they were around $7 billion in the 2015 fiscal year.

Under President Trump, the flow of new regulations was greatly slowed, and their costs were much lower -- a maximum of $300 million in 2018, and a maximum of $600 million in 2019. But there's a big problem. When regulations aren't issued, people are going to get hurt, especially if health and safety are involved. Worker safety regulations prevent illnesses and death. Air pollution regulations protect public health. Regulations intended to prevent the spread of the coronavirus save lives. The Office of Management and Budget's own report confirms that point. Under Mr. Trump, the benefits of federal regulations were also, by far, the lowest on record: a maximum of $600 million in 2018 and somewhere between $200 million and $3.7 billion in 2019. That compares with benefits in excess of $40 billion in both 2005 and 2007, and in excess of $28 billion in 2015. It's crucial to point out that those numbers, capturing the benefits of regulation, are not limited to purely economic savings. They are meant to include deaths, injuries and illnesses prevented. When Republican and Democratic administrations issued expensive regulations, they also saved a lot of lives. The Covid-19 pandemic is vividly making that point. For example, recent work finds that air pollution makes the disease significantly more deadly. Even a small increase in exposure to particulate matter -- one of the most harmful air pollutants -- produces a big increase in the Covid-19 death rate. That finding is consistent with an earlier one, to the effect that in China, deaths from SARS were significantly elevated in areas with high levels of air pollution. That is especially bad news, because levels of particulate matter in the ambient air have spiked under Mr. Trump (after significant decreases from 2009 to 2016). In 2018 alone, that spike was estimated to have caused 9,700 additional deaths.

Consider in this light the Trump administration's decision to finalize its rollback of fuel economy standards -- a decision announced, in a kind of cruel irony, during the early stages of the pandemic in the U.S. The new rule is highly likely to produce significant increases in air pollution (including greenhouse gases). For that reason, it will produce more illness and more death. Or consider the Trump administration's proposal not to tighten regulation of particulate matter, even in the face of scientific evidence, compiled before the pandemic, suggesting that doing that would prevent over 10,000 premature deaths annually. In view of the pandemic, that number might well be too low. Any administration, Republican or Democratic, should be scrutinizing existing regulations and eliminating those that no longer make sense. That is an urgent project, because many regulatory requirements impose ""sludge"" -- paperwork requirements and administrative burdens that make it tough for people to get economic assistance to which they are entitled, or that impose pointless obstacles to those seeking medical help. Right now, doctors, nurses and hospitals could benefit a lot from clearing out regulatory sludge. So could small business owners, whose ability to obtain financial help from the recent stimulus package has been badly undermined by sludge, including paperwork burdens. At the same time, regulations designed to protect health, safety and the environment should be immediately freed from the one-in, two-out rule. They should also be exempt from any other kind of gimmick that focuses on the costs of regulations while turning a blind eye to the benefits. In a pandemic, we need regulatory safeguards in a hurry. Whenever their benefits exceed their costs, they should be welcomed. And even when the pandemic is over, the president of the United States should celebrate, rather than stymie, the efforts of experts, in regulatory agencies and elsewhere, to use their knowledge to prevent unnecessary illnesses, accidents and deaths -- and to protect the most vulnerable members of society.

Theater,Children's Fare? This 'Little Red Riding Hood' Tests That Notion,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/theater/joel-pommerat-little-red-riding-hood-tilt-kids-festival.html,"Menacing shadows on a bare stage. A little girl neglected by her busy mother. A threatening shape amid the gloom, and amplified chomping noises. Uh-oh. This is not your Disney-fied fairy tale. But while the actors are in contemporary clothing, and the aesthetics are downright experimental by American standards, the French writer-director Joel Pommerat's take on ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is very much for children. Now, New Yorkers ages 7 and older can enjoy it this weekend as part of the Tilt Kids Festival, organized by the French Institute Alliance Francaise and the Cultural Services of the French Embassy. Mr. Pommerat actually created the show for one child in particular: his daughter Agathe, 7 at the time.

""I didn't see her often because her mother and I had separated, and I also worked a lot and was often on the road,"" he said by telephone from France. ""I'd tell her, 'I'm off to work, I'm in the theater,' and I could tell that she didn't care. It wasn't concrete to her, and frankly, that bothered me a bit. So I thought, 'Fine, I'm going to create a show for you and I hope you'll understand what I do, and that you'll like it.'""

The result was a visually abstract, sonically sophisticated adaptation of ""Little Red Riding Hood,"" and Agathe wasn't the only one to like it. Since its creation in 2004, it has toured the world and confirmed Mr. Pommerat as one of the most innovative figures in contemporary French theater. This is actually a return engagement for ""Little Red Riding Hood."" Tellingly, it first surfaced in New York in 2007 as part of the experimental Crossing the Line Festival -- which attracts hip adult audiences. ""For me it was a revolution to have someone of Joel's caliber create a piece for a young audience and families,"" said Lili Chopra, a curator of both festivals. ""The French cultural landscape has changed since then, and some of the most interesting contemporary writers, directors and choreographers now create works for young audiences."" Deborah Rouach in Mr. Pommerat's stage version of ""Cinderella,"" which he developed in 2011.

Ms. Chopra is confident that even though ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is being presented in French with supertitles, it should compel little ones. ""The staging is so powerful that the sound and lighting help you enter the play's universe,"" she said. ""And, of course, the story is very well known."" Since creating his troupe, Compagnie Louis Brouillard, in 1990, Mr. Pommerat has built a reputation for refined production values, which is reflected in his kids' shows. His brilliant adaptations of ""Pinocchio"" (2008) and ""Cinderella"" (2011) also tour regularly. ""I didn't modify my stage language at all,"" he said of his approach to the productions for young audiences. ""I worked with the same elements, the same vocabulary I use in my shows for adults. I had the same desire to accomplish something spectacular, despite the economy of means."" It never occurred to Mr. Pommerat and regular collaborators like Eric Soyer, the set and lighting designer, and Gregoire and Francois Leymarie, the sound designers, to cut corners because the theatergoers' ages would be in the single digits. ""We wanted to be just as demanding for kids as for adults,"" he said. As for the content, Mr. Pommerat figured that there was a reason that all these stories have endured for centuries.

""'Little Red Riding Hood' and 'Cinderella' used to be the equivalent of films or theater,"" he explained. ""People gathered to tell stories, so they were meant for everybody, not just children. That's why these stories appeal to adults today -- they were meant for them. What happened, I think, is that they have been adapted for children. Walt Disney totally went in that direction, with all that implies in terms of simplification and sweetening. So we've come to think of those stories as too simple, lacking in powerful, authentic emotions."" While Mr. Pommerat made ""Little Red Riding Hood"" accessible, so the younger set could follow it, he did not try to prettify the picture. ""There are scary bits,"" he said. ""I didn't want to traumatize kids, of course, but I also didn't want to water down the emotions. I wanted to take the situations at face value: the encounter with animal ferocity, with danger, with fear, with monstrous things -- two people get eaten after all, that's quite violent! But that violence is symbolic. That's the virtue of art, of theater: You can experience particular emotions while being protected by the fiction of performance. You come to the theater to see something that's simultaneously fake and a description of reality.""

Challenging notions of what constitutes children's fare is key to Tilt, which runs through March 18. The multidisciplinary slate also includes a special matinee of ""Gala,"" a new show by the renowned choreographer Jerome Bel at the N.Y.U. Skirball Center; a lettering workshop building on the Arabic and Latin alphabets at the Cooper Hewitt, Smithsonian Design Museum; philosophical discussions led by Simon Critchley, the author of such decidedly non-young-adult classics as ""The Problem With Levinas,"" at the Brooklyn Public Library; and a concert/jam by the jazz drummer Billy Martin at Issue Project Room. ""This is the first time Issue Project Room is holding a show for kids,"" Ms. Chopra said, ""and it was just great to have preparatory conversations there. We maintain the same artistic requirements but we open up to an audience that may not otherwise have gone to Issue Project Room. I fully believe that when you put artists who are pigeonholed as niche, difficult, elitist in a new context, you can see that the labeling is not true. It's proof that this work can reach a wide audience that might have thought it wasn't for them.""","Joël Pommerat's visually abstract, sonically sophisticated adaptation will be performed this weekend as part of the three-week Tilt Kids Festival.",ffc2286b-6c49-5b5d-ac0c-5d009290868c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/02/arts/02tiltkidsfest1/02tiltkidsfes1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=460&w=879&s=f05350ab0da4071e67815c247157b238e13560ef20deab698dd4f25632bbd9d1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The French writer-director Joël Pommerat's ""Little Red Riding Hood"" is being performed as part of the <a href=""http://tiltkidsfestival.org/"">Tilt Kids Festival</a>.",ffc2286b-6c49-5b5d-ac0c-5d009290868c,N24News/imgs/ffc2286b-6c49-5b5d-ac0c-5d009290868c.jpg,10
Technology,Silicon Valley Warms to Trump After a Chilly Start,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/30/technology/silicon-valley-trump.html,"Tech companies have slowly grown more comfortable with President Trump, who was initially a target of Silicon Valley criticism. Chief executives including Apple's Tim Cook, Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Amazon's Jeff Bezos met with the president in June.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Two days after Donald J. Trump won the 2016 election, executives at Google consoled their employees in an all-staff meeting broadcast around the world. ""There is a lot of fear within Google,"" said Sundar Pichai, the company's chief executive, according to a video of the meeting viewed by The New York Times. When asked by an employee if there was any silver lining to Mr. Trump's election, the Google co-founder Sergey Brin said, ""Boy, that's a really tough one right now."" Ruth Porat, the finance chief, said Mr. Trump's victory felt ""like a ton of bricks dropped on my chest."" Then she instructed members of the audience to hug the person next to them. Sixteen months later, Google's parent company, Alphabet, has most likely saved billions of dollars in taxes on its overseas cash under a new tax law signed by Mr. Trump. Alphabet also stands to benefit from the Trump administration's looser regulations for self-driving cars and delivery drones, as well as from proposed changes to the trade pact with Mexico and Canada that would limit Google's liability for user content on its sites. Once one of Mr. Trump's most vocal opponents, Silicon Valley's technology industry has increasingly found common ground with the White House. When Mr. Trump was elected, tech executives were largely up in arms over a leader who espoused policies on immigration and other issues that were antithetical to their companies' values. Now, many of the industry's executives are growing more comfortable with the president and how his economic agenda furthers their business interests, even as many of their employees continue to disagree with Mr. Trump on social issues.

The relationship remains bumpy. Mr. Trump lashed out at Amazon on Twitter on Thursday, accusing the e-commerce giant of evading taxes. (Amazon said it had saved $789 million under the tax law Mr. Trump signed.) The president is also expected to sign legislation, passed by the Senate last week, that would strengthen policing of sex trafficking online -- a bill that internet companies once opposed because they worried it would make them liable for content posted by their users. Yet quietly, the tech industry has warmed to the White House, especially as companies including Alphabet, Apple and Intel have benefited from the Trump administration's policies. Those include lowering corporate taxes, encouraging development of new wireless technology like 5G and, so far, ignoring calls to break up the tech giants. Mr. Trump's tougher stance on China may also help ward off industry rivals, with the president squashing a hostile bid to acquire the chip maker Qualcomm this month. And Mr. Trump let die an Obama-era rule that required many tech start-ups to give some workers more overtime pay. Mr. Trump ""has been great for business and really, really good for tech,"" said Gary Shapiro, who leads the Consumer Technology Association, the largest American tech trade group, with more than 2,200 members including Apple, Google, Amazon and Facebook.

""This isn't Hitler or Mussolini here,"" Mr. Shapiro said. And even though the president's new tariffs on steel and aluminum could hurt American businesses and consumers, ""disagreement in one area does not mean we cannot work together in others,"" Mr. Shapiro said. ""Everyone who is married knows that."" Mr. Trump himself has taken to naming tech companies he says are on his side. After Apple took advantage of the new tax law in January to bring back most of the $252 billion cash hoard that it had parked overseas, the company said it would make a $350 billion ""contribution to the U.S. economy"" over the next five years. That prompted Mr. Trump to suggest he had made good on a campaign pledge to get Apple to bring jobs back to the United States. ""You know, for $350 million, you could build a beautiful plant. But for $350 billion, they're going to build a lot of plants,"" the president told members of Congress last month. Mr. Trump said he had called Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, to personally thank him. In fact, Apple has no plans to build a plant in the United States. The company is uneasy with Mr. Trump's invoking it to signify how his policies are working, according to a person close to Apple who was not authorized to speak publicly. Apple has not, however, publicly corrected the president. Mr. Trump has also stayed quiet on the controversy engulfing Facebook over user privacy, while other politicians have called for more regulations after revelations that the British political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica improperly harvested the information of 50 million Facebook users. Cambridge Analytica used that data to aid Mr. Trump's campaign. Michael Kratsios, the White House's deputy chief technology officer, said in an interview that while Mr. Trump and Silicon Valley had their differences, ""in places where we do see eye to eye, I think we're achieving extraordinary success.""

Some tech executives have since disagreed with Mr. Trump on social issues. Mr. Cook emailed staff last June to say he had unsuccessfully lobbied the president to remain in the Paris climate accords. In November, Microsoft sued the administration to protect a law that blocks deportation of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers. More than 100 companies, including Google, Facebook and Uber, filed a brief supporting California's lawsuit on that issue. Even so, tech executives worked to build a relationship with the president, with some meeting him at Trump Tower before his inauguration and again at the White House in June. While in Washington for the second meeting, Mr. Cook and Satya Nadella, Microsoft's chief executive, also dined with Jared Kushner, the president's senior adviser and son-in-law, and Ivanka Trump at the couple's Washington home, according to a person briefed on the meeting who wasn't authorized to speak publicly about it. This month, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin visited Apple's headquarters.

Silicon Valley has found plenty to like about the Trump presidency. In September, tech giants including Facebook and Microsoft teamed up with the administration to pledge $500 million to computer science education. Amazon, Microsoft and Google are also eyeing the administration as a potential customer as Mr. Trump pushes to modernize the government's digital infrastructure. But Silicon Valley's favorite thing about Mr. Trump is almost certainly his new tax code. Many tech companies lobbied for corporate tax reform for years before Mr. Trump signed the new tax bill. Tech giants immediately reaped the benefits. Under the new rules, Apple saved $43.7 billion in taxes, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a nonpartisan research group. Apple then announced the $350 billion ""contribution"" to the economy over five years. Most of the tally was previously planned spending with American suppliers and a $38 billion tax payment on its overseas cash. But Apple also said it planned to hire 20,000 new workers, invest in new data centers and another domestic campus, and increase a fund for innovative American manufacturers to $5 billion from $1 billion. It also gave employees $2,500 bonuses. The president was quick to tweet the news.","Even though Mr. Trump still takes potshots at Amazon, the industry's relationship with the White House is shifting as tech companies find some common ground with the president.",013c5ecd-e5d9-51dc-a5c8-da0962cb3a89,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/14/business/14TRUMPTECH-1/14TRUMPTECH-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a0a197c1b91907637f641e0c8835d6bca6226bdb30931784e55fdcbd5d1f1f24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. Cook, right, and the venture capitalist Peter Thiel met with Mr. Trump in December 2016.

Art & Design,Auction Houses Postpone Live Sales and Pivot to Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/19/arts/design/art-auction-houses-sales-coronavirus.html,"Suspended animation: Francis Bacon's ""Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus"" was shown at Sotheby's in London in March and estimated to sell for upwards of $60 million in the May Contemporary Art auction in New York. Sotheby's has not said if the sale will be canceled or postponed.





Francis Bacon's 1981 three-part oil painting, ""Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus,"" was supposed to feature in Sotheby's marquee contemporary art evening auction in New York on May 13, where it was estimated to sell for at least $60 million. That live auction clearly won't be happening now, in light of the coronavirus. But Sotheby's has yet to announce what it plans to do with its May sales instead: Hold them online? Postpone them till late June, as its competitors, Christie's and Phillips have -- assuming it's possible for people to gather by then? Cancel till the world is less upside down? Like companies all over the world, auction houses now find themselves in uncharted territory, trying to find a way to keep their businesses afloat even as the future of buying art looks as if it may be forever changed. With workers being furloughed and headquarters lying empty, some art professionals say the current necessary switch to online sales -- also underway at galleries -- could have a lasting impact on the live auction enterprise.

""I'm thinking really seriously about what the online experience is for our clients,"" said Amy Cappellazzo, chairwoman of the Fine Art division of Sotheby's. ""In effect, we've been in the live theater business. Now we're segueing into what is more like live streaming. The truth is, that revolution has been underway for some time."" Art market veterans agree that the pandemic has accelerated changes that were underway -- an effort by auction houses to build up private and online sales; to reduce costly and cumbersome catalogs; and to develop younger, nontraditional customers. ""People who can change, adapt and innovate will be the ones best able to move forward,"" said Clare McAndrew, an art economist who puts out the annual Art Basel and UBS Art Market Report. ""The online segment could be a big winner here."" Auction houses have been trying to adjust quickly, though the uncertain trajectory of the virus makes it difficult to solidify plans. The most immediate question is the spring auctions, which anchor the art market calendar, along with the fall sales in November; last May, the five-day series of sales at Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips raised a combined $2 billion. Both Christie's and Phillips have consolidated their New York Impressionist, Modern and contemporary art sales into one week of 20th-century auctions scheduled for the end of June that will also absorb the London June sales. The Hong Kong sales have been pushed to July, though that, too, may be wishful thinking.

Could the live auction ultimately become a relic of the past? Still unclear is whether people will be able to travel or gather for in-person auctions as soon as this summer -- and, if not, whether auction houses would try to sell those big-ticket works of art in an online auction, where the prices are usually lower. ""For certain higher-priced objects, the jury is still very much out on whether an online-only sale without opportunity for proper viewing can truly maximize value,"" said Edward Dolman, the chairman and chief executive of Phillips. ""Once you get to a point where people see online sales maximizing or exceeding value, that would be the tipping point; that's when you'll see our business going broadly online.""

The pandemic also raises questions for auction houses' costly overhead. If the auction world becomes more virtual, houses will have to re-evaluate their need for prime real estate. Phillips' new Park Avenue headquarters, for example, was due to open in May, but construction has now been halted. ""This is the stimulus the art market needed to move online,"" Ms. McAndrew said. ""Buying online isn't a collector's No. 1 choice; it won't replace the excitement and sense of community of an auction. But online sales will help relieve the cost pressures of live events."" All of the auction houses have added online-only sales across several categories for April and May and are already seeing results. Phillips said its March 4 20th century and contemporary art auction had a record number of online participants, with bidders from 47 countries. And nearly half the lots from its April prints sale received bids in the first 24 hours. However, the most expensive item bought by an online bidder in March was a KAWS piece, which topped out at only $350,000.

Sotheby's 21 online sales since March 1 have totaled a healthy $40.1 million, which may reflect the fact that the auction house's new owner is the telecommunications mogul Patrick Drahi. Up to 50 percent of the bidders in these sales have been entirely new to Sotheby's, the auction house said, and 50 percent of all bids are being placed on mobile devices. ""The art market -- after resisting for so long -- has been forced to give digital a chance,"" said Thierry Ehrmann, chief executive and founder of Artprice, an auction-result database in France.

Even old school collectors seem to be getting more comfortable bidding online, because right now that is their only option. ""I've seen a lot of clients I wouldn't have expected interested in the technology,"" Ms. Cappellazzo said. ""Your palms are sweaty, you're hoping it's your bid -- it's a bit like a video game."" Christie's has increased its online-only auctions in April and May from nine to more than 20 events, which are estimated to raise at least $20 million. ""This crisis is a moment of truth for online sales,"" said Guillaume Cerutti, Christie's chief executive.

The transition to e-commerce is buoyed by an emerging class of wealthy millennials who are spending more than six times the amount of their parents' generation and have few qualms about buying art online, according to the Art Market Report, which also indicated that 92 percent of this demographic have bought works through the web. Others point out that seasoned collectors -- especially those in distant parts of the world -- already buy some artworks sight unseen, trusting the reputation of established auction houses, condition reports and their own connoisseurship.

Whether those online sales can start including multimillion-dollar masterpieces is still unknown. Before the pandemic, the May sales were expected to be strong, given first-rate material like the Anderson collection of postwar American art at Sotheby's, valued at $55 million, which includes pieces by Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still. The Macklowe Collection has postponed its decision about how that trophy material will be sold. The idea that collectors will feel comfortable bidding tens of millions of dollars on an investment like the Bacon triptych -- especially if they haven't seen it in person -- still seems unlikely. ""I'm not an online fan,"" said Adam Lindemann, a prominent collector and dealer. ""I want to see the real thing if I can.""

Mr. Gorvy also emphasized that sellers need auctions to gauge where the market is; sporadic private sales don't provide enough information on whether prices have fallen as a result of the virus. ""There is nothing publicly to test the market -- no fairs or auctions,"" he said. ""It's holding up business. People don't really know at what price to trade."" Postponing sales are not just a matter of pushing them back on the calendar. Consignments involve complicated contracts that stipulate not only the date on which an artwork will be sold but how it will be marketed, where it will appear in the catalog and other minutiae. If the sales don't happen as scheduled, sellers could decide to withdraw their consignments. Similarly, auction houses that have promised sellers a certain minimum price could pull out of those guarantees. Auction houses are trying to balance the interests of waiting for the best time to obtain the highest prices and needing to sell soonest to keep the lights on. Even if auction houses can manage live sales by June, experts say, collectors may not be in the mood to conspicuously lay out large sums for art, when many have lost their loved ones and may still be worried about their own physical and financial well-being. ""This insane thing turned the world inside out -- everyone is affected at some level,"" said Mr. Lindemann, the collector. ""We have to be careful to temper self-interest and think how we can help out. Promoting and chasing sales at this time just feels wrong.""","In response to Covid-19, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips are stepping up digital selling, but the prices don't yet come close to those in the auction room.",3c689c72-7857-597c-9b1b-d0a4767a5508,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/20/arts/15virus-auctions-bacon2/15virus-auctions-bacon2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=3a932ee7ec2be6971e0f4b6f8d2ba219da8cfd05109077ea70eb687eec3c988f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Suspended animation: Francis Bacon&rsquo;s &ldquo;Triptych Inspired by the Oresteia of Aeschylus&rdquo; was shown at Sotheby&rsquo;s in London in March and estimated to sell for upwards of $60 million in the May Contemporary Art auction in New York.

Economy,China Tightens Controls on Overseas Use of Its Currency,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/29/business/economy/china-tightens-controls-on-overseas-use-of-its-currency.html,"SHANGHAI -- As an exodus of money adds to the pressure on a slowing economy, regulators are trying to put the brakes on overseas use of China's currency by increasing the scrutiny of certain overseas deals. The decision to restrict overseas use of the renminbi represents a setback in China's long-term drive to turn the currency into a rival to the dollar and euro in the global marketplace. Beijing had pursued a greater role for the renminbi as a way to increase its economic influence. Part of the renminbi's appeal in international finance was that most Chinese companies could borrow and spend it overseas while seldom seeking approval from financial regulators in Beijing. But that leniency created a problem for China. The currency flowed out of the country in recent months and then traded heavily overseas, beyond the control of China's regulators.

The situation has contributed to the currency's steady weakening against the strong dollar this autumn. That weakness, in turn, has prompted some Chinese businesses and households to move even more money out of the country before its value can erode further. ""The authorities, under the relentless pressures of capital outflows, are poised to impose extensive restrictions on capital movements, marking a reversal of the gradual liberalizations introduced in recent years,"" Fred Hu, the chairman of the Primavera Capital Group, an investment firm based in Beijing and Hong Kong, wrote in an email reply to questions. ""While such capital controls may be intended to be temporary,"" he wrote, ""they will introduce mounting uncertainties for Chinese outbound investments."" In an effort to slow the exodus, an affiliate of China's central bank, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, issued a directive to bankers on Monday that amounted to additional scrutiny. The directive, which was quickly and broadly circulated within China's financial community, told banks that their domestic customers must check with the Beijing regulator before transferring $5 million or more -- in dollars or renminbi -- out of the country. The rules will also cover renminbi that is sitting in overseas accounts, which had previously escaped most regulation.

""The People's Bank of China in Shanghai is facing great pressure to keep a balance"" between inflows to and outflows from China, said the directive, referring to the Shanghai office of the central bank. The directive said that 5.1 trillion renminbi, or $740 billion, sluiced out of China in the first 10 months of this year while only 3.1 trillion came back into the country.
* What happened on Day 2 of Elizabeth Holmes's testimony.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange declined Tuesday evening to respond to a faxed question regarding offshore renminbi, suggesting that the question should be submitted instead to the People's Bank of China. The central bank did not respond to questions late Tuesday evening. Government directives are not supposed to be public in China. In a sign of government irritation at the unauthorized distribution, censors reached into private WeChat social media accounts on Tuesday and deleted copies of the directive. The rules appear to take aim at a relatively discrete set of overseas deals that largely allow companies to pull money out of the country, rather than more strategic acquisitions. Many Chinese companies, for example, have used their overseas subsidiaries to buy or borrow renminbi in Hong Kong, London, New York and elsewhere from the international arms of Chinese banks. Some of them then sell the renminbi and buy dollars, in a bet that the dollar will strengthen. The new rules will apply broadly to Chinese companies. In the past, only companies with headquarters in Beijing typically had to notify the government of big moves in offshore renminbi. Even so, the new rules amount more to a modest tweak than an outright overhaul. Capital controls in China already restrict the movement of money. Individuals, for example, are not supposed to move more than $50,000 out of the country annually. Companies, too, have limits and other approval processes. The latest directive basically adds another layer of approval and closes some additional escape valves.

""They are not changing the rules,"" said Jeffrey Sun, a partner in the Shanghai office of Orrick, Herrington and Sutcliffe, a global law firm. ""It's that, internally, they need to go through this extensive process."" While Chinese regulators are increasing their scrutiny, they have been reluctant to ban overseas investment outright. Four different regulators issued a joint public statement on Monday through the official Xinhua news agency to emphasize that it was still acceptable for Chinese companies and households to invest overseas. China's overseas investments have ""played an important role in deepening China's mutually beneficial cooperation with other countries and promoting domestic economic restructuring and upgrading,"" the statement said. But even those more strategic deals may soon get a second look. Regulators are also drafting rules that would require prior approval from Beijing for very large overseas corporate acquisitions. The draft rules on very large acquisitions, first reported by The Wall Street Journal last Friday and subsequently confirmed by bankers and executives who were briefed on the plans, would mandate that prior approval be obtained for deals exceeding $1 billion in real estate or in industries outside the Chinese company's main area of business. Any acquisition would also require prior approval if it exceeded $10 billion. But some bankers are skeptical that such rules will make much of a difference. Most large Chinese deals, like the pending acquisition of Switzerland's Syngenta by the state-owned China National Chemical Corporation, involve well-connected companies that have long received top-level endorsement for their bids in advance anyway. ""The companies behind these large acquisitions are themselves very influential, and many will still find ways to close targeted deals,"" said Brock Silvers, the chief executive of Kaiyuan Capital, a Shanghai investment advisory firm.","With money surging out of China, the Chinese central bank makes it harder for Chinese customers of banks to complete overseas transfers.",b7a68a44-5cb6-5473-9699-490908f5b8a2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/30/world/30Yuan/30Invest-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=d156a970bda2692a9c852f0b798f96dea7bbc7ace3633debc2635e00c54b9a67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The headquarters of the People's Bank of China, the central bank, in Beijing.

Books,The Illness That Had No Name,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/13/books/review/amanda-stern-little-panic.html,"When she finds out that what she's suffered from all her life has a name, this news is delivered matter-of-factly by her mother's therapist. ""I don't understand how it's taken this long for someone to diagnose you,"" he says. I wondered the same thing.

Beginning at an early age, Stern was tested by doctors, specialists and tutors. She was evaluated for visual, learning and hearing disabilities; cognitive impairments; ambidexterity; motor-skill deficits. She was measured and scored by an endless array of adults, all of whom seemed oblivious to her actual symptoms. Stern believed herself to be defective, crazy and dumb.

Upon receiving her diagnosis, she reflects, ""I've spent my entire life battling some impossible, invisible plague no one ever seemed to see, and this guy did it with such ease, as though panic disorder is easy to establish, obvious to anyone who would take the time to ask what my symptoms were."" The statement is all the more remarkable given that Stern was raised in Manhattan, the epicenter of neurotic behavior -- not to mention shrinks. Yet everyone, including her mother, seemed to be looking in the wrong place, colluding in a misplaced vigilance focused on Stern's intellectual performance, physical health and adaptability rather than her feelings.

As a child, Stern shuttles between a brownstone in Greenwich Village, which she shares with her bohemian mother and siblings, and her remarried father's apartment in an affluent neighborhood uptown, where ""a weekend lasts an entire month."" When 6-year-old Etan Patz disappears nearby in 1979, the police come to Stern's mother's house asking about the boy, and Stern internalizes an ominous message: ""My mom always tells me bad things like that don't happen to kids. But I know they do.""

Patz's disappearance haunts her for years to come. When the ""Still Missing"" posters in SoHo are plastered over, she is furious. How will anyone find him? When she and her mother walk past buildings, she wonders whether he's inside, waiting to be discovered. In college, during a spiral of panic, she is overcome with guilt. Maybe she didn't look for him hard enough, or in the right places.","Amanda Stern's memoir, ""Little Panic,"" recounts her quest to discover why she felt so different.",4de03664-0403-5a7b-99bb-a63135517430,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/15/books/review/15Leve1/15Leve1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=921b991ddd764cbfbe5f6dd11b69778ad84104e00a7dca82b8667f0db6d906ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Amanda Stern,4de03664-0403-5a7b-99bb-a63135517430,N24News/imgs/4de03664-0403-5a7b-99bb-a63135517430.jpg,13
Music,"Women Fighting Sexism in Jazz Have a Voice. And Now, a Code of Conduct.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/arts/music/we-have-voice-jazz-women-metoo.html,"Nine of the 14 members of the We Have Voice Collective, which is releasing a Code of Conduct for the improvised-music community, photographed at the Jazz Gallery in Manhattan. Clockwise from top left: Imani Uzuri, Tamar Sella, Ganavya Doraiswamy, Sara Serpa, Linda May Han Oh, Fay Victor, Rajna Swaminathan, Maria Grand and Jen Shyu.

Over the past year a steady stream of public testimonials from female jazz musicians has made clear what most already knew privately: Sexism and harassment are deeply ingrained in the improvised-music world. The We Have Voice Collective, a new group of female and non-binary musicians in jazz and experimental music, plans to release a Code of Conduct on Tuesday that aims to build upon the conversations sparked by jazz's own #MeToo movement, clearly articulating what a more equitable workplace might look like and setting expectations for change. The collective comprises 14 instrumentalists and vocalists and is working to ensure that predatory and sexist behavior is seen as aberrant, not as part of the cost of doing business in jazz.

""The idea is to propose solutions, and also open the conversation to go further,"" the tenor saxophonist Maria Grand, a member of the collective, said. ""How do we change this culture? And not just in the dynamic of victims denouncing perpetrators, because that puts the victims at a lot of risk. What we're trying to do is change the cultural mind-set so that people know what to do when they suspect or see abuse.""

Nine organizations -- festivals, venues, educational institutions, labels and small media outlets -- have signed on to the Code of Conduct, committing to abide by it. The collective hopes they will also display it prominently on their physical premises and websites. The first wave of adoptees includes Winter Jazzfest in Manhattan, the Banff International Workshop in Jazz & Creative Music and Biophilia Records. The flutist Nicole Mitchell, a collective member, suggested that adherence to the document could become ""a mark of distinction, and a certain kind of elegance"" for institutions in the jazz world. The code, which was collectively written over a period of months, is divided into two painstakingly written sections: commitments and definitions. The commitments are a series of specific answers to the question, ""How can we commit to creating safe(r) spaces in the performing arts?"" The definitions offer a small, detailed glossary explaining the meaning of ""sexual harassment,"" ""workplace"" and ""consent."" We Have Voice will be promoting the code and fostering further conversations during a slate of round tables scheduled for May, including one at the New School on May 7 and at the Vision Festival on May 24. (The collective will also convene a discussion at Harvard on May 9, and in Geneva on May 27.)

The group came together late last year, growing out of two independent email conversations. One small group of musicians was discussing writing a code of conduct, and another was composing an open letter to the jazz community on the topic of sexual harassment and assault. A unified team began working via email and Google Hangouts, first focusing on the open letter. The participants soon began inviting other musicians in. Over a period of months the membership swelled to about 20, then settled down to the 14 in the collective now. We Have Voice features award-winning musicians like Ms. Mitchell and the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington as well as young musicians still completing their graduate studies. And it is diverse in terms of ethnic background -- something that led to a constant stream of suggestions and refinements on the language. ""The beauty of this collective is that everybody has different things they can offer, different experiences,"" Ms. Carrington said.

As a result, We Have Voice espouses a devoutly intersectional-feminist point of view, using the term ""safe(r) spaces"" throughout the code in acknowledgment that each person's specific background confers a different relationship to power, so there is no Platonic ideal of a safe environment. The group plans to keep its makeup stable for now, not adding or subtracting members, and wants to become known as a resource for young musicians, perhaps creating an informal mentorship program in the process. ""We want to have more emphasis on women leading -- to have that as the norm rather than the exception,"" said the vocalist and multi-instrumentalist Jen Shyu, a collective member. In December, We Have Voice released the open letter, calling on their peers in the music community ""to speak up when witnessing or suspecting abusive or discriminatory behavior."" Nearly 1,000 people have now signed it.

Meanwhile, tales of workplace and classroom harassment have continued to pile up in the jazz world since early last year. The young trombonist Kalia Vandever posted an article on Medium in March attesting to her own experiences as an undergraduate at Juilliard and offering some ideas about what ought to be done. Ms. Vandever said that despite being promoted as a poster child for the school, she was one of only two women in Juilliard's robust jazz program, and often felt stranded. Teachers frequently subjected both her body and her playing to special scrutiny, sometimes making explicitly sexual comments, she said.

""Looking back on my accounts of sexual harassment and misogyny, it's difficult not to wish I had spoken up in the moment or confronted my peers or teachers directly after the misconduct, but I didn't have the guidance, knowledge, nor confidence to say something at the time,"" she wrote. ""It shouldn't be my responsibility -- especially within the classroom -- to say something."" It's this lack of support that the collective is aiming to confront -- both by offering counsel and mentorship, and by codifying expectations for institutions. We Have Voice's efforts are not the only of their kind taking place in the jazz world. The Women in Jazz Organization, an advocacy group pushing for gender equity, was founded last year. And at schools like the Berklee College of Music, students and teachers have organized on behalf of survivors of sexual assault and harassment. Looking broadly at the music industry, it is widely seen as lagging behind even Hollywood on gender equality, and it has no labor body comparable to the Screen Actors Guild -- which released its own sexual harassment code of conduct in February -- to battle for artists' interests. In jazz, power is not as centralized in the hands of corporations, which in turn employ pop producers and control entire creative supply chains. Rather, in the improvised-music business, the most important single entity is the musicians themselves. Beyond that, it is festivals and educational establishments. We Have Voice hopes many more such institutions will align with its code of conduct. ""We're not really doing this for the branding, or trying to be part of the one time that this happens in the mainstream,"" said Rajna Swaminathan, a collective member. ""We're really trying to do the groundwork and hold institutions accountable.""",A 14-member collective battling harassment in improvised music is releasing guidelines for more equitable workplaces and expectations for change.,fc27134f-01e9-52dc-9042-5e6e863202e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/01/arts/01jazzwomen1/01jazzwomen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=768e754d3138dca25c7f3f5a212b51d07f628933f868ac9a132ee63df71c23d1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nine of the 14 members of the We Have Voice Collective, which is releasing a Code of Conduct for the improvised-music community, photographed at the Jazz Gallery in Manhattan.

Fashion & Style,This Week's Wedding Announcements,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/19/fashion/weddings/this-weeks-wedding-announcements.html,"Anna Haight Grummon and Hunt Volney Allcott were married Aug. 18 at Pinecrest Chalet, a resort in Pinecrest, Calif. Elizabeth Allcott St. Clair, the groom's sister, officiated, having become a Universal Life minister for the occasion. Ms. Grummon, 29, is a doctoral candidate in health behavior at the University of North Carolina's Gillings School of Global Public Health, in Chapel Hill. She studies nutrition policy, including how policies such as soda taxes, food warning labels and nutrition assistance programs affect diets and health. She graduated with distinction from Stanford. She is a daughter of Phyllis T. H. Grummon and David S. Grummon of East Lansing, Mich. The bride's father retired as a professor of materials science at Michigan State University and is now a metallurgical consultant. Her mother retired as the director for planning and education at the Society for College and University Planning in Ann Arbor, Mich. In 2001, the bride's mother was one of 12 women who skied 60 miles from what was then the Barneo Ice Station to the North Pole as part of the WomenQuest Polar Trek. Dr. Allcott, 37, is an associate professor of economics at N.Y.U. and is working as a principal researcher, in Cambridge, Mass., for the research division of Microsoft, the software company. He studies how psychological factors affect human behavior, and what this means for business and public policy. He also graduated from Stanford, and received a doctoral degree in public policy from Harvard. He is the son of Elizabeth Hunt Allcott and Dr. John V. Allcott III of Eugene, Ore. The groom's mother retired as a psychologist in private practice in Eugene, and was also a psychotherapist in Eugene for Amigos de los Sobrevivientes, which provides support to Latin American immigrants. His father is a primary-care physician in private practice in Eugene, and was a recipient in 2017 of the Nobel Peace Laureate Project's ""Inspirer of Peace"" award for his dedication to peaceful community education. The couple met in August 2013, shortly after Mr. Allcott moved to Berkeley, Calif., and joined a track practice of the San Francisco Road Runners Club. Ms. Grummon was also at the workout, and the two soon found themselves talking. ""We had a funny six-week period where we would get dinner afterward,"" Ms. Grummon said. ""It would always be casual. He'd say, 'Who's hungry?'

Earlier this month thousands of Hong Kong residents began marching against a bill that would allow extraditions to the mainland. The timing of the demonstrations makes them ever more potent: This month marks the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, when Chinese troops unleashed their firepower on a throng of protesters in Beijing who were calling for democracy in the Communist country. This new documentary revisits the seven weeks that led up to the killings and maps out how a peaceful, student-led movement ended in unthinkable carnage. The director Ian MacMillan weaves archival footage with testimony from protesters, witnesses and Communist Party insiders who watched the tragedy unfold.

MIKE EPPS: ONLY ONE MIKE (2019) Stream on Netflix. Throughout his 20 years in entertainment, Mike Epps (""Next Friday,"" ""How High"") has usually appeared on the sidelines playing goofy secondary characters. But when it comes to comedy, he steals the show. In this new special, the actor and comic performs in front of a packed house in Washington, delivering salacious one-liners (some more juvenile than others) and ruminating on relationships and family. One moment he's flashing a toothy smile and explaining how old age can slow down a man's sex drive. The next he's recalling how his daughter's boyfriend won him over (it involved some potent weed).

MY BEAUTIFUL LAUNDRETTE (1986) Stream on the Criterion Channel; rent on Amazon, iTunes or Vudu. This beloved dramedy, directed by Stephen Frears, tackles homophobia, racism and sociopolitical inequality with one too many subplots. But the thread that holds it together is the impenetrable romance between Omar (Gordon Warnecke), a young Pakistani man in South London, and Johnny (Daniel Day-Lewis), a childhood friend who grew up to be a street punk. After his uncle asks him to take over a rundown laundromat, Omar crosses paths with Johnny and enlists his help. The two transform the dirty establishment into a glamorous one, rekindle their spark and get caught up in a drug deal along the way. Writing in The New York Times, Vincent Canby called the movie a ""rude, wise, vivid social comedy."" He added: ""'My Beautiful Laundrette' has the broad scope and the easy pace that one associates with our best theatrical films.""

DAMNED Stream on Britbox. Before Himesh Patel landed the lead role in the upcoming Beatles movie ""Yesterday"" (opening Friday), he co-starred in this British workplace sitcom about social workers who focus on children services. The show deftly balances its weighty subject material -- some cases involve student-teacher relationships, missing teenagers and prostitution -- with a hilarious portrayal of humdrum work life akin to that of ""The Office."" ""Damned"" only ran on Channel 4 for two seasons, but critics gave it a thumbs up: The Telegraph called it ""unforgiving, warm and extremely funny.""",A new documentary peels back the curtain on the Tiananmen Square protests.

Television,Review: Food and the City in 'Sweetbitter' on Starz,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/arts/television/sweetbitter-review-starz.html,"Ms. Danler, who developed the series herself and wrote several episodes, has worked in interviews to position ""Sweetbitter"" as a coming-of-age story rather than a restaurant story, and she's right. For all the screen time spent on the preparation and presentation of food, the focus is always on the personal. Tess may struggle to perfect the three-plate carry, but she's really trying to figure out what's going on between Simone and Jake, and whether she can (and should) get in on it.

Is any of this sounding familiar? It may seem unfair, 20 years down the line, to trot out ""Sex and the City"" in the discussion of a new story about a young woman's New York awakening. (Just ask Lena Dunham.) But the ""Sweetbitter"" playbook isn't much different.

The show has a moody, dark peak-TV look and tone, and Tess is younger than Carrie Bradshaw, who was already an established writer and fashionista when ""Sex and the City"" began. But Tess arrives in New York at about the same age Carrie did, in her back story, and the scene she observes -- one of the show's defining traits as a drama is that she's more of an observer than an actor -- is populated by Mr. Bigs, toxic bachelors, gay husbands. Tess falls down the stairs at the restaurant like Carrie on the runway, hospitality roadkill.

""Sweetbitter"" could overcome the familiarity of its situations if they had a little more flavor to them, but Ms. Danler is stingy with the spice. ""Sex and the City"" worked because it was, for most of its run, an expertly tooled farce, but also because it sold the wonder of New York -- you didn't question why Carrie and her friends were always so excited.

""Sweetbitter"" wants us to see how the inchoate, undefined longings that pull Tess to New York find a focus in the restaurant and how learning about food and wine kick-starts an entire sensibility, an approach to the world. For that to work, the show needs to sell the world of the restaurant the way ""Sex and the City"" did the city.","Stephanie Danler turns her best-selling novel, about a young woman who comes of age while working in a New York restaurant, into a three-hour TV season.",5b5adda9-3ed6-5d52-a493-7223e5fd9148,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/arts/04sweetbitter/04sweetbitter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=092401e1325c864540bda63802542e0765e9fa1eae6416ada7b9eddae3cffefe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ella Purnell in &ldquo;Sweetbitter&rdquo; on Starz, adapted by Stephanie Danler from her book of the same title.",5b5adda9-3ed6-5d52-a493-7223e5fd9148,N24News/imgs/5b5adda9-3ed6-5d52-a493-7223e5fd9148.jpg,3
Sports,"Eddie Shack, Feisty Wing for Powerful Maple Leafs, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/27/sports/hockey/eddie-shack-feisty-wing-for-powerful-maple-leafs-dies-at-83.html,"Eddie Shack of the Maple Leafs loomed over Gary Bergman of the Minnesota North Stars in Toronto in 1974. A lyric in a popular song about Shack went: ""He knocks 'em down and he gives 'em a whack.""





Eddie Shack, a colorful, pugnacious wing who became a fan favorite at Maple Leaf Gardens playing for Toronto's four Stanley Cup championship teams of the 1960s, and who remained in the public eye as a pitchman on Canadian television sporting a cowboy hat and flowing mustache, died on Saturday in Toronto. He was 83. Shack's death, at a hospital, was announced by the Maple Leafs. He had been treated for throat cancer. Shack played for 17 N.H.L. seasons, with six teams, and appeared in three All-Star Games. He scored the winning goal for Toronto in Game 5 of the 1963 Stanley Cup finals against Detroit, though he took no credit, saying the puck had caromed into the Red Wings' net off his backside. ""He was a powerful skater,"" Darryl Sittler, the captain of the Maple Leafs in Shack's last season with them, told The Peterborough Examiner of Ontario. ""His body was thick. His forearms. And he could score goals.""

Shack whipped up the home crowds, at times with help from family. ""If I wasn't playing, my dad would stand up across from the Leafs' bench and start yelling, 'We want Shack!'"" he told The Toronto Sun. ""Then I'd stand up on the end of the bench on my side and start the cheer too."" Shack was 6 feet 1 inches tall and 200 pounds or so, good size for a forward of his time. His roughhousing inspired the 1966 novelty song ""Clear the Track: Here Comes Shack,"" written by the hockey broadcaster Brian McFarlane and sung by Douglas Rankine with The Secrets. As the tune put it: ""He knocks 'em down and he gives 'em a whack."" Shack was known as the Entertainer for his exuberance and also as the Nose, for his prominent one. In his memoir ""Eddie Shack: Hockey's Most Entertaining Stories"" (2019), written with Ken Reid, Shack told of head-butting the Montreal Canadiens' Henri Richard (who died in March) in a game in Toronto, then hearing from his big brother, Maurice the Rocket, when the Leafs were in Montreal. ""Maurice said, 'Thank God you never hit him with your nose or you would have split my brother in two.'""

Edward Steven Philip Shack was born in Sudbury, Ontario, on Feb. 11, 1937, to Bill and Lena Shack, Ukrainian immigrants. His father was a crane operator. Eddie was ill for several years as a boy and missed school but was promoted from one grade to the next nonetheless, leaving him unable to read and write. He quit school at 15 and was signed by the Guelph Biltmores, a New York Rangers junior team. Shack made his N.H.L. debut in the 1958-59 season with the Rangers, who traded him to the Maple Leafs in November 1960. He played for their Stanley Cup championship teams in 1962, '63, '64 and '67. He was later with the Boston Bruins, the Los Angeles Kings, the Buffalo Sabres, the Pittsburgh Penguins and the Leafs again. He retired after the 1974-75 season with career totals of 239 goals, 226 assists and 1,431 penalty minutes in 1,047 regular-season games. He was in the N.H.L.'s top 10 in penalty minutes four times. Though he was illiterate, Shack proved astute in drawing on his popularity for commercial opportunities. ""He once told me, 'I can't read or write but I can count,'"" his former Maple Leafs teammate Dick Duff told The Globe and Mail of Toronto. In his later years Shack was an advocate for literacy programs in schools. He and his wife, Norma (Givens) Shack, who survives him, had two children. A complete list of survivors was not immediately available. For fans of the Canadiens, the Maple Leafs' chief rival, Shack was a villain, as Quebec's premier, Francois Legault, acknowledged wryly in paying tribute to him in a Twitter posting on his death. He saluted Shack ""with the sentiments of many fans and teams for which he didn't play,"" Mr. Legault said, adding, ""We loved to hate him.""","He helped Toronto win four Stanley Cups in the '60s, his pugnacity earning love in Toronto (and, no surprise, hatred in rival Montreal).",ace43913-014e-5860-ac97-784826de10dd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/28/obituaries/27Shack-sub/27Shack-sub-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b8c7a43582dcc7d9d353961fe5e36261cdd0c7ae26b448ccd5dc4906f10e81dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Eddie Shack of the Maple Leafs loomed over Gary Bergman of the Minnesota North Stars in Toronto in 1974.

Technology,The Gap Between the Haves and Have-Nots of Tech Widens,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/03/technology/google-earnings-big-tech.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- When Google's parent company, Alphabet, said on Monday that revenue at the company soared past $161 billion last year, it was a stark reminder of the widening gap between tech's wealthiest outfits and the rest of the industry. And there is little reason to believe that will change. In the last two weeks, Microsoft, Apple and Amazon -- like Alphabet, all flirting with a $1 trillion stock value on Wall Street -- posted record results. The final member of tech's Big Five, Facebook, which is a little more than halfway to a $1 trillion valuation, also reported strong earnings. With each passing quarter, tech's wealthiest companies are building on their power, making it harder for smaller outfits to compete and for entrepreneurs to build the next Google or Facebook. Amazon and Microsoft are profiting from the shift to cloud computing. Apple continues to own the premium market for apps, smartphones and wearable devices, while Google and Facebook are maintaining their grip on digital advertising.

This gravitational pull toward a handful of companies could have far-reaching implications for the global economy. Few tech outfits can afford to make the investments necessary to keep pace with the giants. The rest? They often have to pay up for access to the giants' many, many customers and technology. ""The strong are getting stronger, and the weak are getting weaker. It's a market of haves and have-nots,"" said Daniel Ives, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. ""In 20 years covering tech, it's unlike anything I've ever seen."" Despite saber-rattling in Washington and elsewhere, it is clear that regulatory and legal scrutiny of the tech industry's most valuable companies so far has done little to hurt the bottom line. Last year's financial results could lend more weight to arguments that a handful of companies, with dominant market shares and outgunned competition, are unfairly cashing in on their control. Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook made a combined $55.2 billion in net profit in the most recent quarter. The next five most valuable tech companies made roughly $45.5 billion in their four most recent quarters. While Facebook is lagging behind the rest of the Big Five, it is still worth twice as much as the next most valuable company, Intel. The picture is darker the further down tech's food chain you go. A growing number of start-ups are cutting jobs to get their expenses under control. And older tech companies, still profitable but slowly losing influence, are struggling to adapt to the changing landscape.

As the rich get richer, they are also branching out. They are muscling aside or buying out rivals. And they are locking in the industry's best engineers with paydays smaller companies could never match. Amazon said last week that it had invested in the infrastructure needed to speed up shipping times for its Prime members to one day from two, raising the bar even higher for retail competitors. But Monday's trading on Wall Street showed just how hard it is to stay in the trillion-dollar club. Despite its e-commerce and cloud-computing dominance, Amazon's value dipped just a bit below $1 trillion. Apple recently earmarked billions of dollars to create shows and movies for its video subscription service in a challenge to Netflix, while Alphabet agreed to buy the activity tracker Fitbit for $2.1 billion in November and the analytics software firm Looker for $2.6 billion in June. ""Today's dominant companies have so much power across such a broad array of markets and continue to leverage that power to expand into new markets,"" said Patrick Spence, chief executive of the speaker maker Sonos, at a congressional antitrust hearing last month in Boulder, Colo. Sonos has sued Google, accusing Google of infringing on five of its patents, including technology that lets wireless speakers connect and synchronize with one another. Tech's richest companies seem to be defying a Wall Street assumption that as a company gets bigger, it becomes difficult to find new ways to make money and maintain rapid growth. Alphabet said profits in the last quarter of 2019 were 19 percent more than a year earlier. Revenue rose 17 percent to $46.1 billion, slightly below Wall Street expectations. The company's stock fell 4 percent in after-hours trading To assuage some concern about sluggishness in its main search ad business, Alphabet disclosed for the first time detailed revenue figures for its YouTube and cloud computing units, which are growing faster than the rest of the company. YouTube sold $15.1 billion worth of ads in 2019, up 36 percent, while its cloud unit grew more than 50 percent to $8.9 billion. Ad revenue from search increased 15 percent to $98.1 billion.

Gene Munster, a managing partner at Loup Ventures, a venture capital firm in Minneapolis, said it was harder than ever for new challengers because the top incumbents were so effective at ""incremental evolution,"" like Apple's building subscription offerings to go with its hardware or Google's branching out into cloud computing. The big tech companies skillfully move into new markets with lower prices and more money for marketing than their new competitors. In time, they take over. The outsize nature of the profits at some of these companies has driven an explosion of wealth on the stock market. The total value of Microsoft shares has risen nearly 70 percent over the last year, adding more than half a trillion dollars to the company's market cap. Apple tacked on more than $550 billion in an 85 percent surge. Alphabet's rise of more than 30 percent has added more than $200 billion to its market cap. Amazon, which had a 20 percent jump, has been something of a laggard but still added roughly $200 billion to its market cap. The large technology firms that dominate the public stock markets are at the extreme edge of a broader trend in American corporate life. Over the last half-century, the biggest American companies have captured a fatter share of profits produced by public companies, according to research from Kathleen M. Kahle, a University of Arizona finance professor, and Rene M. Stulz, an economist at Ohio State University. In 1975, the top 100 public companies snared about 49 percent of the earnings of all public companies. By 2015, that share had jumped to 84 percent, their research showed. They have not updated their numbers since then, but Ms. Kahle, in an email exchange, said she doubted the numbers had decreased. ""There are a lot of small, unprofitable firms and a handful of large, very profitable ones,"" Ms. Kahle wrote in an email.","Despite regulatory scrutiny and pressure from lawmakers, the industry's wealthiest are continuing to grow at remarkable speeds for big companies.",1a50ad8a-99d9-5081-8a76-4310ca49ea70,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/03/business/03google/03google-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a887c37cb3c20dee170ff34c5ce654a6e21a8d622b3c39740b2c3a21d11e943f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The parent company of Google said Monday that fourth-quarter profits were up 19 percent from a year earlier.,1a50ad8a-99d9-5081-8a76-4310ca49ea70,N24News/imgs/1a50ad8a-99d9-5081-8a76-4310ca49ea70.jpg,20

A part-time judge who moonlights as Bongo Lady, one of the team's most easily recognizable superfans, Meacham, 51, was among those who labored through the N.B.A.'s extended layoff this season, her cartoon bongos rendered silent by the coronavirus pandemic. But when the Grizzlies faced the San Antonio Spurs in a seeding game at the N.B.A.'s restart at Walt Disney World in Florida, she seized the opportunity to make her presence felt again. Clad in her personalized powder-blue jersey, Meacham provided her ticket information -- Section 2, Seat 1 -- then spent the next two hours sweating through every possession. In the third quarter, she even broke out a pair of bongos (autographed by the former defensive stopper Tony Allen) at the urging of the other fans in her section. ""We should all do the air bongos!"" Meacham said. The weird thing was that Meacham was nowhere near the arena. In fact, she was on her living room couch in Hernando, Miss., shouting at her laptop computer.

As part of its expansive efforts to build atmosphere for games inside its fan-free bubble at Disney World, the N.B.A. has been inviting spectators to attend -- virtually. Select fans who are viewing the games from home are being livestreamed onto three video boards that extend along each baseline and one sideline. There are 10 sections in all, each with 32 seats, helping produce the vague appearance of bleachers -- along with the all-too-familiar feel of a video conference call, which seems sadly appropriate these days. ""We wanted to create something that would bring our fans to the players,"" Sara Zuckert, the N.B.A.'s head of Next Gen Telecast, said in a telephone interview. ""It's also a way to give fans the opportunity to feel like they're interacting while enhancing the broadcast for everyone else at home."" As the coronavirus continues to upend sports, and the way that fans view them, leagues around the world have showcased varying levels of creativity when it comes to sprucing up their empty backdrops. Major League Baseball teams have deployed cardboard cutouts of fans. An inventive baseball club in South Korea enlisted stuffed animals to fill its stadium. At Major League Soccer's tournament in Florida, digital video boards hum with activity. And then there are the tarps -- so many tarps in so many countries sheltering so many vacant seats. In partnering with Microsoft, the N.B.A. has harnessed the magic of 21st century computer technology to beam fans like Bongo Lady straight into its three arenas at Disney World. (Imagine reading that sentence before the start of the season.)

Former players like Paul Pierce, Chris Bosh and Manu Ginobili have also made appearances -- from the comfort of their own homes. Games now double as ""Where's Waldo?"" searches: Was that really Shaquille O'Neal watching the Milwaukee Bucks play the Miami Heat? (Yes, it was.) Peggy Rounds, an account executive with the Grizzlies, reached out to Meacham to see if she would be a virtual fan for the team's game against the Spurs. ""Who wouldn't want to try this?"" Meacham asked. Meacham signed a three-page waiver that detailed various rules. Near the top of the list: no bad language, as audio of the virtual fans would be blended and piped into the arena. Meacham knew in advance that she was going to wrestle with that restriction. As the game wore on, she was grateful for the option to turn off her microphone. Yes, Bongo Lady muted herself. She did pick her spots, though, such as when the Spurs' Lonnie Walker threw up an errant jumper. Meacham leaned into her laptop. Meacham was looking at a split screen of the rest of the fans in her section, in the form of a video conference, and a live feed of the game itself. She also had the regional broadcast of the game on her television, which provided a much larger, more user-friendly viewing experience. But there was a delay, which was problematic: Her reactions as one of the virtual fans needed to come in real time, and that required her to pay attention to the pint-size feed on her laptop. Still, the TV broadcast was vivid and seductive, and Meacham wanted to see what was actually happening. She was both invested in the game -- which the Grizzlies desperately needed to win to increase their odds of landing a playoff spot -- and eager to fulfill her duties as a virtual fan. The tension was real. ""I'm glad to do this for the players,"" she said. ""If there's any chance that it gives them some extra oomph, then it's worth it.""

Rounds, the Grizzlies' account executive, policed Meacham's section as a moderator (no cursing; stay in your seat) while a member of the team's dance crew pumped up the energy by starting chants. There was a semi-successful attempt at doing the wave. When Ja Morant, the team's star guard, drained a jumper, several fans mimicked his ""goggles"" celebration. Meacham yelped with delight. ""High-five! High-five?"" Meacham said as she extended her arms. ""Nobody's high-fiving."" She experienced other minor inconveniences. She was unfamiliar with the Microsoft program. (""I'm a Zoom girl,"" she said.) The virtual fan ""sitting"" in front of her was too close to the camera on his computer, which had the effect of partly blocking her out. (""I keep trying to get his attention,"" said Meacham, who pretended to squeeze the offending fan's head between her thumb and index finger like an overripe tomato.) But she also struggled to remain in her own seat as the game slipped away from Memphis. ""I get too hyped up,"" she said. ""I'm usually standing."" The fourth quarter was excruciating for Meacham, who spent entire possessions with her head in her hands. She put her bongos away. ""I think I may need a drink,"" she said. Afterward, she digested the loss by reflecting on the experience. ""I know the N.B.A. is just trying to do the best they can under the circumstances,"" Meacham said. ""And I'm honored that the Grizzlies asked me to do it."" But she was still looking forward to the day when she could watch a game the old-fashioned way -- in person.","No standing up, and definitely no cursing: The basketball superfan known as Bongo Lady takes us behind the screen as she is beamed into an N.B.A. game from her couch in Mississippi.",201bcece-0391-58e9-8dc6-6903107fd62d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/07/sports/07nba-virtualfans01/07nba-virtualfans01-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=64b3d10e072167a469cd6f8c0680369273fa5bb1e83b5c5bdd4094e127529b1b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Malenda Meacham, a Grizzlies season-ticket holder, at her home in Hernando, Miss.

Fashion & Style,"Brioni Redefines Itself, With a Whisper and a Smirk",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/fashion/brioni-new-creative-director.html,"PARIS -- As there is a German word for everything, so there is a German word for one of fashion's first world problems: ""schwellenangst,"" the fear of crossing the threshold -- into an intimidating museum, theater or, relevant to the example below, a shop. It was schwellenangst that Nina-Maria Nitsche, the new creative director of the Roman tailoring concern Brioni, had on her mind at her first presentation for the label in Paris last week. Too many stores, she said, feel cold and clinical, devoid of a human touch, unwelcoming to those who may dare breach their borders. But she just as well could have been talking about the house of Brioni full stop. Its august history notwithstanding (among its claims to fame are hosting the first men's wear runway show, in 1952, and dressing plutocrats, world leaders and select James Bonds in uber-expensive suits in the years since), the house has become a bit confused in the contemporary era, as it has cycled through creative leaders in the last few years. Why should the man of means spend his hard-earned six-figure bonus on Brioni, rather than Brunello, or Berluti, or anyone else?

Ms. Nitsche represents something of a U-turn herself. She spent the last 23 years at Maison Margiela, many of them alongside Martin Margiela, the Belgian ur-conceptualist who helped set the direction for high fashion for years. Brioni, by contrast, represents a retreat into the wardrobe. But Ms. Nitsche found them in many ways parallel. ""For me, at Margiela, in the middle of the interest was also the original garment, the stereotype,"" she said. ""Of course, it was much more about concepts, in a certain way, and Brioni for me today is not so much about fashion."" Brioni, she said, was not for any one particular man, age or type but for people who ""want a little bit more, how do you say, 'spezzato'?"" The word means broken, but she meant its more popular sartorial definition, mismatched, or as she put it, ""unexpected."" There is something a little broken, a bit winningly off-kilter, about Ms. Nitsche's Brioni; it even has a touch of humor not always in evidence when a label is turning out $163,000 alligator jackets. (Ms. Nitsche suggested throwing one on under a suit jacket.) Her beautifully tailored tuxedos come in black, but also almost black: a dark chocolate brown and an almost imperceptibly fir green, a private joke on the black-tie circuit for the man who wears it. The jackets alone can require 220 to 230 steps of construction at the hands of Brioni tailors in Penne, in the Abruzzo region of Italy, whom the label recruits from the tailoring school it supports.

Ms. Nitsche's three-piece suits come classic and correct, but also in versions that are, as it's said, spezzato: in checks that, on inspection, turn out to be subtly mismatched piece to piece. (One of her waistcoats: Surprise! It's a cardigan.) These are minor upsets in the grand scheme, but they speak not only to a Margielian sense of mischief, but also to a commendable desire to speak small, to the man who wears the clothes rather than to the public that recognizes them at 50 paces. Likewise her presentation: the clothes on rails and the models real men -- doctor, lawyer, record collector -- displayed in photographs taken at their homes, homes that spilled out, in clever, quiet ways, into the presentation itself. (The flowers in the vase of one had dropped their dead blossoms onto the floor; one man's son's Legos had overflowed from his living room into the presentation.) ""When Brioni started in the '50s, everything was so classic, and Brioni was quite revolutionary because they did things in colors and fabrics which normally were used for women's wear,"" Ms. Nitsche said. ""They said, 'It's the peacock revolution!' I think today there are so many brands and houses doing fashion for men, so I said, 'Brioni should not do fashion. They should do garments.'""","After a succession of creative directors, the Roman tailoring house shifts again with Nina-Maria Nitsche, a clever, sly veteran of Maison Margiela.",d86ed389-d5cc-5ae9-a03f-a909af7e8ba9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/25/fashion/25brioni1/25brioni1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=462&w=882&s=6db1b2091f7c626397a3be3318453043f517b9e5ee41b40119ee0d609637ecd7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A look from the Brioni fall 2018 collection.,d86ed389-d5cc-5ae9-a03f-a909af7e8ba9,N24News/imgs/d86ed389-d5cc-5ae9-a03f-a909af7e8ba9.jpg,19
Opinion,When Populism Can't Beat Identity Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/opinion/taiwan-election-tsai-han-populism.html,"TAIPEI, Taiwan -- Populism was supposed to be the winning formula. With the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (D.P.P.) steadily campaigning on growing anxiety over threats to Taiwan's national identity, the Kuomintang, a party that favors close ties to China, risked being consigned to playing permanent opposition. Populism seemed to offer it a way out. It was populist promises, after all, that had helped Han Kuo-yu, of the Kuomintang, triumph in local elections in late 2018. Yet the same playbook failed him and his party miserably in the general elections this weekend. Not only was Mr. Han unable to woo new voters; he couldn't even hold on to many traditional Kuomintang sympathizers. President Tsai Ing-wen was re-elected with 57.1 percent of the popular vote; the D.P.P. won 61 of the 113 seats in the national Legislature. The D.P.P.'s victory is partly the result, as many analysts had predicted, of its successful efforts to drag the election back onto the conventional battleground of sovereignty and identity. Ms. Tsai invoked often the protests in Hong Kong to remind voters of the threat that China poses.

Yet the D.P.P. election stands for more than a rejection of the Kuomintang's cozying up to China; it was also a repudiation of Mr. Han's populist discourse. Mr. Han's stump speeches were full of such themes. He claimed to know the people and represent them against a craven elite. Taiwan had once burst with vitality and prosperity, he said, but now it was stagnating because the Tsai administration had put its interests above those of the population. At a rally in early December, Mr. Han denounced ""a small cabal"" at the helm of the D.P.P. ""They feast and feast,"" he railed. ""The factions divide the spoils among themselves."" ""These people,"" he added, ""eat the flesh and drink the blood of Taiwanese people. Now, after three and a half years, all of Taiwan is sick."" Mr. Han spoke relentlessly about his connection with the real people, the ""shumin."" He claimed that the ""shumin"" lead bitter existences, that all they want is to have ""good daily lives"" and that this could be ensured by entertaining close relations to China -- the quickest way to create jobs, markets and other economic opportunities. When Mr. Han ran for mayor in the southern city of Kaohsiung in 2018, the D.P.P. attacked him as unfamiliar with policy and claimed that his proposals for creating jobs were unrealistic. But those technocratic arguments fell flat against Mr. Han's grand commitment to stand with the people. And Taiwan's sovereignty seemed a distant worry from the usual concerns of voters in local elections. Mr. Han's shocking victory then, and in a city traditionally hostile to the Kuomintang, jolted the D.P.P. leadership.","Still, President Tsai of Taiwan wasn't re-elected just because she's tough on China.",bc9699c4-8ab2-5139-acbb-ac3bd120becc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/12/opinion/12batto/merlin_166974717_dad6468e-ae02-422b-a6cb-793e6d894bb3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c794cf30556391d0c9d1f509899e9556796a8fb60d39b072605869aaeb06f7b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A supporter of Han Kuo-yu, a candidate for president, watching election returns on Saturday.

Travel,"For a Seattle Enclave, Isolation May Be Its Salvation",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/12/travel/seattle-south-park.html,"South Park, one of Seattle's dwindling blue-collar pockets, is on the rise. Yet the scruffy, geographically isolated enclave has managed to transform itself without losing its soul to gentrification, causing outsiders -- including other Seattleites -- to take notice. Situated on the western shore of the Duwamish River in a hard-to-reach corner of the city, South Park has turned its relative remoteness and affordability into an advantage, attracting creative entrepreneurs who otherwise might not be able to set up shop in one of the nation's fastest growing cities. (Rents are cheaper here.) A hip wine shop, a brewery and a handful of new restaurants and bars greet interlopers who cross the neighborhood's main artery to mainland Seattle, the South Park Bridge.

Now, though, with the bridge's reopening in 2014, South Park has seen a revitalization that has not yet brought on full-bore gentrification. Industry remains prominent in the area, protected by zoning and geographic forces, including being hemmed in by the river and a phalanx of highways. ""Perhaps the upside of being located farther afield is that a close-knit community's been formed that's flown relatively under the radar -- and thus been less susceptible -- to gentrifying forces,"" said Cynthia Brothers, the founder of Vanishing Seattle, her one-woman organization that documents endangered small businesses and cultural institutions on Instagram and other mediums.

""If everything is too polished and finished, it's super boring,"" Ms. Soerens said. South Park also appealed to Dan Slemko, who moved to the neighborhood in 1997. The 60-year-old former Boeing employee owns a waterfront home on the Duwamish River, which sounds sexier than it is. Seattle is a city known for its pristine waterways, but the Duwamish was so polluted that it was declared a Superfund site in 2001 . It's a working river in a working-class neighborhood. It's slowly getting cleaner, as is South Park. Shortly after Mr. Slemko got his last box unpacked, he drove to the now-defunct County Line, a raucous saloon near the South Park Bridge, and promptly got his headlights smashed out. Many neighborhoods would perhaps enlist law enforcement to deal with such an establishment. But not South Park: According to Loretta's owner Scott Horrell, a group of residents instead designated a night to drink together at The County Line -- to meet the rabble rousers on their own turf rather than calling the authorities.

""The bridge closure was terrifying, but it turned us into an island. It solidified us and our regulars. They were trapped,"" said Mr. Horrell, a physically imposing former trucker who became South Park's foremost beer and burger proprietor -- as well as a resident. Since the bridge reopened in 2014 -- and especially since new restaurants and watering holes opened near South Park's main intersection of 14th Ave. S. and S. Cloverdale St.-- Seattleites are increasingly seeking South Park out. And because of skyrocketing housing costs in Seattle, younger residents are increasingly buying homes in South Park, a genuinely diverse neighborhood with a lush community garden called Marra Farm.

Campbell Scarborough and his wife, Katie Escudero, moved to Seattle from Los Angeles, and bought a modern home in South Park four years ago. South Park reminds Ms. Escudero of Los Angeles's Echo Park neighborhood, while Mr. Scarborough considered it a ""no-brainer"" in 2017 to open Left Bank, South Park's oldest wine shop -- because it's the only one -- at the intersection of 14th and Cloverdale. The couple sells modestly priced European wines out of a space so small that ""you can't really come here and have an intimate conversation,"" Mr. Scarborough explained. Patrons bring their own vinyl albums to spin on the shop's stereo on Tuesdays, and the owners keep Rainier beer on tap just so Mr. Slemko, a cheap-beer aficionado known to locals as ""River Dan,"" feels right at home when he swings by each night. Mr. Slemko is well known for his parties . His Fourth of July bash -- replete with fireworks and live music -- reportedly rivals the region's officially sanctioned celebrations. ""I've been to enough of his parties to be immune to the noise. And if you don't like it, it'll be over in a few hours,"" said Dave Wilkinson, who owns a house down the street from Mr. Slemko's.

One of Mr. Bennett's tenants at 14th and Cloverdale, Corina Luckenbach, operates a former ballroom and billiards parlor called South Park Hall, which is now a multiuse space that has everything from square-dance potlucks and Jazzercise classes to karaoke brunches. Ms. Luckenbach said Mr. Bennett's ethos is to ""rent to people who are struggling to pay the rent."" Risk-taking and an all-in mentality ensue. ""Most of the people I know who open these places use every dime they have,"" said Mr. Horrell, who counts himself among that flock. In June 2017, Ms. Soerens and her husband, Tim, nearly died in an automobile accident after getting struck by a drunken driver in Mexico while celebrating their 10th wedding anniversary. One year later, they opened their coffee shop, Resistencia, near the intersection of 14th and Cloverdale, and business has been brisk. The Soerenses live near the community garden, Marra Farm, and positioned a pair of hospital beds in their living room during their recovery from the crash. For three months, Ms. Soerens said neighbors brought meals, cared for the couple's sons, walked their dog, and otherwise caught up with one another. It was immensely helpful, exhausting and exhilarating -- and served to cement the couple's commitment to their tight-knit community.",The working-class neighborhood of South Park is hard to reach and affordable. It's also somewhat of an anomaly in one of the nation's fastest-growing cities.,a97bf815-12dc-5c9a-a4a0-853c990c62fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/14/travel/12Seattle-HeadsUp1/12Seattle-HeadsUp1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=235f56047e37787228f9eff89e9eb0f73922cc21dde1bab1f36fdecff16b3b48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Seattle neighborhood of South Park is resurgent though not easy to reach.

Movies,George Clooney on 'The Midnight Sky' and Donald Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/movies/george-clooney-midnight-sky.html,"George Clooney in Los Angeles, where he has been quarantining with his family.Credit...Magdalena Wosinska for The New York Times



George Clooney in Los Angeles, where he has been quarantining with his family.

In the Zoom era, the room behind you can really tell a story, and so it goes with George Clooney. On a recent video call to talk about his new Netflix movie, ""The Midnight Sky,"" Clooney gestured to the living room shelves behind him, which had been hastily stocked with books and booze. ""This is all I got left, man!"" Clooney said with the mock frustration of a father ceding the kingdom to his children. ""They took the office and they made it a playroom, then they took the bar and they made it a nursery."" Clooney has spent the past several months quarantining in Los Angeles with his lawyer wife, Amal, and their 3-year-old twins, Ella and Alexander, while also putting the finishing touches on ""The Midnight Sky,"" which he directed and stars in. In that sci-fi drama, Clooney plays a scientist struggling to warn space-faring astronauts that Earth has been ravaged by an unspecified catastrophe.

In the time since Clooney finished shooting the film earlier this year, our Earth hasn't been doing so hot, either. In a wide-ranging interview, we spoke about the global pandemic, Hollywood's new streaming era and the outgoing president, whom Clooney used to encounter in New York back when ""he was just a dog chasing girls."" These are edited excerpts from our conversation. It's been four and a half years since you last starred in a movie, and a lot has changed when it comes to streaming services: Your film is coming out on Netflix, and Warner Bros. just moved its entire theatrical slate for 2021 to HBO Max. What do you make of a move like that? It feels like a decision from AT&T [Warner Bros.' parent company], which is not a film company. I mean, I was at Warner Bros. for 20 years and under contract with them -- it was a real star-friendly studio. It feels like all they're trying to do is get HBO Max going, because you're not going to recoup on movies like ""Dune"" that are designed to make a billion. I always figured the windows were going to get tighter as we moved forward, but this is a little crazy. But I think it's going to be fine. I really do. People want to get out of their house -- I got twins, man! And it's still a great way to ask somebody out. Comedies are great in cinemas, scary movies are great in cinemas. So I don't see it completely going away.

With box office out of the equation, and a streaming service that doesn't necessarily report viewership numbers, how will you decide if ""The Midnight Sky"" is a success? You're right, that is a big difference. Maybe it's good; I've had a lot of flops. Look, I'll be 60 this year, and I get to be on a set with people I adore and work in a profession that I can't believe I'm lucky enough to do. So I guess that's sort of the victory in the whole thing. I didn't have it for the early part of my life -- I did jobs I hated and lived for the weekend. Your character in ""The Midnight Sky"" is focused on his career to the exclusion of love and family. Was that ever you? Yeah, but I hadn't found the person that filled everything up for me, that would have made me fully in love. I dated a lot of really terrific women, but Amal showed up and suddenly it was like, ""Well, this is different on every level for me."" I don't think I was actively saying, ""I'm just going to work on my career and I'm not going to have a wife."" That was the story that got told about me, but it wasn't really the reality.

You can, but the rules have changed for me. I had a run there with three films in a row that were ""Out of Sight,"" ""Three Kings"" and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou."" If any of those screenplays came to me with a part that I could play, I'd do it, but those screenplays are rare. I'm not bored with acting, I'm more concerned with the idea that I know for a fact how careers go, because I've seen it: My aunt Rosemary was a big singer and then she wasn't. Things change, I know that. I have no interest in quitting, but you have to reassess what it is you're going to be good at. Have you considered working with some newer directors, instead of established ones? I've seen some films where I go, ""Oh, that's really interesting, smart filmmaking,"" but you also have to get to know directors a little bit. I have to know that they love what they do and they aren't [jerks]. Because you've had that experience before? Well, I've had that experience a few times, and I had to say, ""Life is too short."" We get to do something that most people I know would love to do for a living, so you should be celebrating that. I remember as a young man hearing movie stars talk about how hard their life was, and I was cutting tobacco for a living! I was like, ""I want you to be telling me how great it is."" I want to work with people that love what they do. Paul Newman used to go, ""Yeah, it's fun!"" The last few years of his life, we became friends, and it really felt like he just loved what he did for a living. He was friends with Gregory Peck, and they never disappointed in real life who they were as movie stars. I don't want people that are yelling and screaming and are angry at the world. Once, I was on a directors round table with a director who was like: ""I break actors down. I'll do 40 takes until they have nothing."" I looked at him as an actor, and I was like, ""Man, I'm never going to work with you."" Joel Schumacher passed away earlier this year. He directed you in ""Batman & Robin."" What's the best story you can tell about him from that set?

There's a moment in ""The Midnight Sky"" where your character puts a mask on a little girl and says, ""Never take it off, no matter what."" I would imagine that line plays very differently now than you meant it to. The idea that we politicize things like this is crazy. Had Trump come out at the very beginning and said, ""We're all going to wear masks because it's the right thing to do and it's going to save a lot of lives,"" the whole country would have gotten behind him and he would have been re-elected. But he thought it would affect his economy, so he chose to say it didn't exist. And now we're going to have 350,000 people dead. Biden has said that once Trump is out of the picture, he will be able to reach across the aisle and find Republicans who are willing to cooperate with him. Do you agree?","His new movie is on Netflix, but the actor-director says theaters won't go away and Hollywood will be fine. He's not so sure about Washington.",c3e4346e-eec1-5984-bf11-7a925e4c5f63,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/24/arts/23george-clooney2/23george-clooney2-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Clooney is optimistic about the future of theaters: &ldquo;People want to get out of their house &mdash; I got twins, man!&rdquo;",c3e4346e-eec1-5984-bf11-7a925e4c5f63,N24News/imgs/c3e4346e-eec1-5984-bf11-7a925e4c5f63.jpg,5

A video went viral showing Mitt Romney, who turned 72 on Tuesday, blowing out the candles on his birthday cake, which was made entirely of Twinkies. Instead of blowing out all the candles in a single breath, he lifted up each individual Twinkie and blew them out one by one. (You won't know how odd it looks until you see it.)

In the video, his staff members seem to awkwardly titter as Romney blows out the first few candles, then an encompassing silence sets in. Trevor Noah had an easy time making fun of it. ""When the laughter died down in that clip, that's when everyone realized they were standing next to a serial killer. Because, I'm sorry, blowing out candles one by one, I think we can all agree, is extremely weird."" -- TREVOR NOAH ""I do get why Mitt Romney likes Twinkies.

Art & Design,"Native American Treasures Head to the Met, This Time as American Art",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/06/arts/design/native-american-treasures-head-to-the-met-this-time-as-american-art.html,"When they visit the majestic American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, some international art lovers -- especially ones from Canada, Australia and Asia -- leave a bit perplexed, as if they've somehow missed an important gallery. ""They go through and expect to see Native American work here,"" Sylvia Yount, the curator in charge of the wing, said the other day. ""Because often where they come from, indigenous art is part of the narrative of a nation's art, in a way that it's not in the United States. We're really behind the curve."" But now the museum, with the help of a promised gift from one of the most comprehensive collections of Native American art in private hands, is poised to catapult itself well ahead of that curve. And the pieces that will soon arrive -- among them a masterpiece jar by the Hopi-Tewa potter Nampeyo; an 18th-century Tlingit dagger with a haunting face-shaped hilt; a painted shield by the Hunkpapa Lakota master Joseph No Two Horns, from the Standing Rock reservation in the Dakotas -- will not go where historical Native American art is often found, in the galleries for the Arts of Africa, Oceania and the Americas. They will go instead in the American Wing, among paintings and sculpture by Gilbert Stuart, John Singer Sargent, Frederic Remington and Augustus Saint-Gaudens, ""to display art from the first Americans within its appropriate geographical context,"" as the museum says.

""We always felt that what we were collecting was American art,"" Mr. Diker said in a recent interview with the couple in their apartment. ""And we always felt very strongly that it should be shown in that context."" Behind them was a rare 19th-century clay water jar from the Acoma Pueblo in New Mexico, sitting cater-corner from a radiant Minimalist painting by Agnes Martin made in the next century and the same state, in Galisteo, N.M., less than 150 miles from the pueblo. And the spot where the Agnes Martin work now hangs was, not long ago, they said, occupied by a prized Navajo chief's blanket, whose slightly quavery horizontal stripes, punctuated by insect-dye red, look like something Martin might have painted. ""More than 40 years ago,"" Mrs. Diker said, ""we made a very important decision -- to remove all the fireplaces from this apartment so that we could make room for more art. Even the doors here are in funny places, to accommodate pieces.""

The couple started out in the early 1960s, as soon as they could afford it, collecting mostly American contemporary painting and sculpture -- Mark Rothko, Isamu Noguchi, Louise Nevelson -- and then, in an unusual but passionate adjunct, pre-Columbian work. ""But at some point we began to think, 'Why collect pre-Columbian, from Mexico and Guatemala, when there's so much wonderful work that was made here, in the place where we live, and is part of that history?"" said Mr. Diker, an investor who became successful early on as president of the Aurora model and toy company. A 19th-century Iroquois/Haudenosaunee pouch donated by the Dikers and displayed in the Met's American Wing. The pouch depicts sacred conjoined twins -- central figures in the legends of New York's Iroquois, or Haudenosaunee. Joshua Bright for The New York Times Their Native American collection began with mostly Southwestern art bought during frequent trips to Santa Fe, N.M., where they eventually bought a house. ""But then we began to encroach, I guess you might say, on the rest of the country,"" Mr. Diker said. ""We wanted quality, not quantity, and we wanted the collection to represent the breadth of the country. We wanted it to be a collection you could teach from."" A few of its pieces are already performing that function in the American Wing, in a preview of what the entire gift, 91 works in all, joining 20 already given by the couple, might look like when it arrives at the museum next year. The gift will be unveiled in a major exhibition scheduled for fall 2018.

During a recent walk through the galleries, Ms. Yount pointed out a work previously donated by the Dikers, a black-on-black olla vessel, by the renowned New Mexican Tewa potters Maria and Julian Martinez, newly on display between Ernest Blumenschein's 1933 painting ""Taos Valley, New Mexico"" and Remington's 1907 painting ""On the Southern Plains."" Nearby, a zigzag-patterned Pomo basket from Northern California, made around 1890, rests next to a recently acquired 1878 painting by Jules Tavernier (1844-1889), ""Dance in a Subterranean Roundhouse at Clear Lake, California,"" a depiction of a Pomo coming-of-age ceremony, showing one of the baskets featured in the foreground. ""These are things we're starting to experiment with,"" Ms. Yount said. ""We don't want Native work to just seem to be an illustration of what you might be seeing in a painting. But at the same time, we want pieces to be integrated, to be a regular part of what we do in these galleries, and not ever made to seem like an add-on."" A new pairing of a Iroquois pouch and a John Trumbull painting of George Washington with Billy Lee, Washington's slave servant, brings up relationships between Native and enslaved people. It's one of many ways ""to complicate the narrative"" told by so many works in the wing, Ms. Yount said, the products of artists on the conquering side of Manifest Destiny. While some American art museums -- among them the Denver Art Museum, the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Montclair Art Museum in New Jersey -- have notable collections of Native American work, many large encyclopedic institutions continue to have spotty holdings. And the sometimes-troubled history of sizable collections of Native art in natural history museums, where the work is usually presented ethnographically, underscores those gaps. The National Museum of the American Indian in New York and Washington, considered one of the world's best collections, has bridged some of the gaps. But curators describe an immense distance yet to be traveled before Native American art is given its due in public collections.

The Met's decision not only to begin pursuing Native American collections -- a priority of Thomas P. Campbell, the museum's director, who is leaving in June -- but also to rethink ""old curatorial constraints,"" is ""a massive leap, really a transformative event,"" said Mr. Torrence, a guest curator for the 2018 show. ""And the Dikers help make that possible. Partly because, as collectors of modern and contemporary art, they approached Native American art with a sense of connoisseurship and aesthetic appreciation that is rare, which is not to say they weren't also interested in the cultural and historical significance of it -- and that's a difficult balance."" The Dikers, leading a winding apartment tour through guest bedrooms and hallways showing work bound for the Met, said that their interest was fueled, and continues to be, by a sense of discovery rare in most collecting fields. ""We felt like we were uncovering something the world really didn't know much about,"" Mr. Diker said. ""So few people were collecting this work seriously."" Mrs. Diker added: ""We never bought these things so that they would go into storage. We wanted art only to be able to live with it."" The thought of much of it soon leaving their home for one of the world's largest, busiest museums, they said, isn't something they like to dwell on. But then again, it won't be going far. ""It's a great museum, it has a huge hole in its collection that needs to be filled -- and we can walk there,"" Mr. Diker said. ""I'd say that's a good fit.""","Almost 100 Native American works from the collection of Charles and Valerie Diker, one of the best in private hands, are promised to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.",0f3fab25-3584-5a04-8451-84cb303c0bd4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/07/arts/07diker4/07diker4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2c697d5acf5c5916a0bee4c250f282251ca2753df58a131b97ee6cc3042c847f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Pomo basket from Northern California, from around 1890, is paired with ""Dance in a Subterranean Roundhouse at Clear Lake, California,"" by Jules Tavernier, in the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.

Food,Inviting the Easter Bunny to the Seder,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/03/dining/easter-passover-ottolenghi-recipes.html,"I went on my first Easter egg hunt a couple of years ago, hand in hand with my then 2-year-old son, Max. I've got 44 years on him, but it was a first for both of us. In Jerusalem, where I grew up, the world of the Easter bunny, hot cross buns, roast lamb and simnel cake just did not exist for me. If someone had described an Easter egg hunt to me -- ""kids rush around collecting chocolate eggs that have been hidden by a rabbit"" -- I would have thought it strange. The concept of Easter was something distant, miles away from our own tradition of Pesach, or Passover. Without a doubt, though, our Seder in Israel would have seemed equally strange to the children tucking into their Easter lunch in Britain, where I live now. Why is a story -- the Haggadah -- told, and what does it mean? Why is the dining plate compartmentalized? What does one even do with lettuce leaves and radishes dipped in salty water? Most important, where's the chocolate?

My moment of connection came as I was delving around in the compost heap at the end of the garden. As I uncovered a gold foil-wrapped egg with Max, my own childhood memories of finding the afikoman -- hidden earlier in the evening, inevitably, behind the sofa -- came flooding back. Back then we were hunting for half a matzo, but the thrill was the same and there it was. At both Easter and Passover, the meal is more than just food. It is the bridge between generations and the signifier of a story. At Easter, the simnel cake is decorated with 11 balls of marzipan to represent all the apostles minus Judas. The lamb represents Abraham's sacrifice of his son, and Christ's sacrifice of his own life. At Passover, flat matzo, rather than regular leavened bread, recalls how the Jews were forced to leave Egypt in such a hurry that there was no time to wait for their bread to rise. Bitter herbs stand for suffering. My own favorite as a child was my Italian grandmother's haroseth. Hers was made of dates with a little bit of orange, dusted with cinnamon and dotted all over with long pine nuts, which made it look like a hedgehog. Tucking into a slice of simnel cake at that Easter lunch -- as rich and dense with dried fruit and nuts as my grandmother's hedgehog haroseth -- was a powerful madeleine moment. Whichever traditions we might be putting into practice over Easter weekend, or the eight days of Passover, they'll be serving two purposes. On the one hand, they are symbolic, providing a platform for all of us to connect with a shared story. On the other hand, these same traditions allow us to connect personally with the history we are making within our own family and circle of friends, last year and the year before that and the year before that, when the kids were very young.

We haven't yet done a proper Seder meal for our children in London. Family-friendly though the celebration is, I know our boys would be in deep slumber well before any haroseth is spread over a piece of matzo. When we do, though, we will be seating the Easter bunny alongside the hedgehog. Such is my story and the story of my family: In order to live on, traditions need to be braided together to become something new. I offer two recipes to those baking, then, that are very different from each other. The casatiello is an Easter bread steeped in Neapolitan tradition. My grandmother may have been Italian, but she certainly wouldn't have been baking with flour for her Seder meal, nor serving pork products (at any time of the year).  Heading out for an Easter Monday picnic is also something of a ritual in Naples, so again, this bread makes sense: All of the fillings, baked as they are into the dough, are safely tucked in and won't fall out. Intended more for the Passover table, then, is the flour-free walnut cake. The necessity for unleavened cakes is the mother of great invention; in so many of my favorite cakes, ground nuts replace the typical flour. The tendency of these nuts to dry out then calls for a pre-emptive drenching with a floral or citrus sugar syrup or, as here, a nutty liqueur like amaretto. The resulting cake is moist enough for the icing to be omitted (or replaced with a dairy-free substitute) for those wanting to serve the cake after the Seder meal. One of the great joys of baking is that the result always gets shared. That sharing is the essence of any celebration: coming together to honor traditions and, quite possibly, give rise to new ones.

Art & Design,Life After Horrific Death for the Journalist James Foley,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/arts/design/james-foley-bradley-mccallum.html,"On a cool October evening, in a Brooklyn studio crowded with canvases, some still wet, Diane Foley stood before an oil painting of two solemn grade-school boys in the Libyan civil war. One of the boys held aloft a photo of a middle-aged man, a relative, who was missing. ""I like this one,"" Mrs. Foley said to the artist, Bradley McCallum. ""I particularly like the ones that show the victims because it's not just destroyed buildings. Jim wanted to inspire us to reflect on what really happens in a war."" Mrs. Foley has a desperately keen understanding of what happens in a conflict zone. ""Jim"" was her son, the freelance photojournalist James W. Foley. He was kidnapped in 2012 while covering the Syrian civil war, held hostage for 21 months and brutally murdered in 2014 by members of the Islamic State in an execution filmed by his captors and released online. Many remember his death, but his mother and Mr. McCallum, who is painting a series based on Mr. Foley's work, want people to remember his chronicle of war, its human cost and his humanity.

Three years ago, Mr. McCallum, 52, approached Mrs. Foley with an idea for a project that would play the role of a memorial, reframe the collective memory of Mr. Foley and make tangible the quality of empathy in his work. After teaching a graduate seminar at Columbia University that examined the way ISIS used visual imagery, including its violent online propaganda videos, to spread cyberterrorism, Mr. McCallum said, ""The memory of seeing it when it was first on television, and the kind of trauma, and the sophistication in the way that video was framed, I wondered, would it be possible for me, in making art, to change the way we see Jim when we search his name?""

From the start, Mr. McCallum conceived of the project as a collaboration with Mrs. Foley. And after a year of conversations, she agreed to license her son's work to him. Mr. McCallum was interested in unpublished source material, the workaday backdrop to the war. Mrs. Foley provided some of her son's external hard drives she hadn't opened, which he had left behind during his last visit home. That archive contained some of Mr. Foley's freelance work for GlobalPost and Agence France-Presse, including footage from the early stages of the Syrian civil war and the downfall of the dictator Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, where Mr. Foley was held for 44 days in his first kidnapping. From them Mr. McCallum is close to completing 23 paintings and has prepared canvases for 10 more. The paintings include collages of images from Mr. Foley's video or photographic stills, a process that Nicholas Mirzoeff, a professor of media, culture, and communication at New York University, described as ""a physical manifestation of the photoshop process."" Photorealist in style, the paintings are oil on linen. Most also include a silk overlay, like a theatrical scrim, with text from Mr. Foley's journal entries.

As he worked on the paintings, Mr. McCallum sometimes shared with Mrs. Foley the text he was printing. They discussed titles for the paintings and at times, struggled to walk the line between consultation and collaboration. ""I'd say to Diane, 'Just trust me because if you try to make the selections, try to be curator of this image or that one, this isn't going to work,'"" Mr. McCallum said. But taking charge and speaking her mind come easily to Mrs. Foley, a flinty New Englander with a model's frame who raised five children and worked as a nurse practitioner. ""It's nice but I don't think it really captures him,"" she said as she stood in the studio before Mr. McCallum's large-scale portrait of her son. She added: ""I like the ones with the children. Jim loved children."" With its reliance on photojournalism, Mr. McCallum's project stands on the shoulders of artists like Andy Warhol, whose visceral Death and Disaster paintings appropriated newspaper headlines and images, like the 1962 Air France crash, one Warhol created the day after it appeared on the cover of the New York Daily Mirror, or his use of Charles Moore's 1963 photographs for Life magazine of dogs tugging at civil rights protesters in Birmingham, Ala. The Foley series is still underway, with the artist seeking a gallery or museum showing. But the collaborative process of memorializing a loved one with a non-artist is already precedent-setting. According to Dr. Mirzoeff, it encourages ""persistent looking,"" raising questions about the ethics of appropriating imagery, of war and conflict, memory and mourning, the refugee crisis, and the varieties of terrorism.

The paintings telegraph literal and figurative loss. In one, a soldier rests a gun on the sill of a broken window that overlooks a street gutted by explosions. ""Mother's Lament"" captures six different video frames and features a woman in a double-layered veil and abaya, her face tight with anguish. In ""Fallen"" men snap pictures of the bloodied corpse of Mutassim el-Qaddafi, the son of the former Libyan strongman. The painting draws its images from 20 video stills stitched together from Mr. Foley's raw video footage. Other paintings, of sky or desert, function as pauses between conflict photography. ""Bradley is not just giving us the most disturbing images -- that's certainly there -- but also paying attention to what is the banality of war, its everydayness, little moments where you are just looking up, at a beautiful arrangement of light,"" Dr. Mirzoeff said. Since his graduate art student days at Yale, Mr. McCallum has spotlighted themes of justice and accountability in his work, including a stint as artist in residence for the New York Civil Liberties Union. His projects comprise collective portraits of women who lost children to gun violence, homeless teenagers and defendants in war-crimes trials at the International Criminal Court in The Hague. Mr. McCallum received a $10,000 grant from the James W. Foley Legacy Foundation with an agreement to return some profits. The family established the foundation in 2014 to provide hostage advocacy services, education and journalist safety guides. During Mr. Foley's captivity, his family said it experienced frustrating and fruitless attempts to work with the Obama administration and were instrumental in that administration establishing a new hostage recovery protocol involving families whose relatives were kidnapped abroad. As the president of the Foley foundation, Mrs. Foley is practiced in being a public figure. Strangers send paintings and drawings of her son to the family's New Hampshire home. The Foleys participated in Brian Oakes's 2016 documentary, ""Jim: The James Foley Story."" Sting wrote and recorded a song about Mr. Foley that was nominated for a 2017 Academy Award. Reporters phone the Foleys for reaction after a journalist is killed, most recently after the October murder of the Saudi Arabian journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Earlier this year, when Mrs. Foley learned that a feature film was being made about a mother's efforts to free her kidnapped son, a reporter in the Middle East, she asked whether it might harm conflict journalists.

In September, that film, Viper Club, written and directed by Maryam Keshavarz, debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival. Ms. Keshavarz said her characters are fictional and drawn from news reports of many kidnapped journalists. But after Mrs. Foley and her husband, John, a family physician, saw the movie, she contacted a producer, J.C. Chandor (the writer and director of ""Margin Call"" and ""A Most Violent Year""), to share her concerns, foremost the film's depiction of journalists ferrying ransom money. After meeting with Mrs. Foley and Nicole Tung, a conflict photojournalist and colleague of Mr. Foley, the scenes were changed and other things, ""personal and too close,"" Mr. Chandor said, were removed. ""The last thing we wanted to do is cause her any more hardship and emotional turmoil."" Ms. Keshavarz said she focused the narrative of the film around the ""emotional anguish of a parent not having control, having to wait, and doing it alone,"" while their child is a hostage. The film is dedicated to conflict journalists, specifically Mr. Foley and four other reporters killed in the Middle East. Google made a small donation to the Foley Foundation. Produced by Google's YouTube Premium, the film will be available via subscription next year. ""I think the film is much safer,"" Mrs. Foley said of the subsequent changes.

Family and friends describe Mr. Foley as warm and outgoing, with a fierce intelligence yet self-effacing and humble. Ms. Tung thinks he would have been ""a little embarrassed"" by the spotlight. ""For him, it was about the people he documented and whose stories were being amplified and not about him -- on the other hand he would have been very honored,"" she said by email from her current post, in the Central African Republic. In the studio, Mrs. Foley and Mr. McCallum fanned through family photographs. There were also prints of the video stills Mr. Foley took in Libya and Syria, in his slivers of ordinary time, between the bombing victims and ruined cities. In one, a flock of dark birds appears in a corner of blue sky, their upturned wings flashing white. His mother studied the images, leaning in closely, and lingering on one that a colleague took of Mr. Foley, his lanky frame curled up with a notebook. ""I love this photo of Jim in the desert, trying to write in the desert,"" she said, her fingertips touching the small cross on her necklace. She pointed out two other images, of the sun rising and setting. ""It was very important when Jim was in captivity, the sound of the birds and of children playing, the sound of prayer, the call to prayer,"" Mrs. Foley said. ""Jim would pray with them."" Mr. McCallum held up a photo of Jim as a teenager at a national park, on a family trip. In it, Mr. Foley is very near a sign that says ""Danger. Keep Off Rocks."" His mother looked at it and shook her head. ""That was where he liked to be,"" she said. ""Right at the edge.""",Diane Foley let the artist Bradley McCallum see her son's unpublished journals. The result is a stunning memorial of war and its human toll.,24ca00a0-2750-5965-9cd7-c8a7e23a2c95,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/16/arts/16foley-mccallum1/16foley-mccallum1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7776e165d0b7a93d7de509bb437b75a0fa32970a81baf819c9993bce538b5b93&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Diane Foley, the mother of the murdered photojournalist James W.

Sports,Rash of Injuries Has the N.F.L. Pointing Broken Fingers at Each Other,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/sports/football/nfl-injuries-week-2.html,"According to conventional N.F.L. wisdom, there are two probable causes of any sudden injury rash: too much high-intensity practice, and not enough high-intensity practice. Many high-profile N.F.L. stars suffered significant injuries on Sunday. The San Francisco 49ers lost quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo, the Pro Bowl defender Nick Bosa, running back Raheem Mostert and others in their victory over the Jets. Carolina Panthers running back Christian McCaffrey suffered an ankle injury that is expected to sideline him four to six weeks. Giants running back Saquon Barkley tore his anterior cruciate ligament, as did Seattle Seahawks defender Bruce Irvin, Denver Broncos wide receiver Courtland Sutton and others (including Bosa). And those are just the biggest names who went down in one weekend.

It's possible that some players were not quite game-ready in the opening weeks because of upended workout routines and the shortened training camp. It's also irresponsible to draw conclusions based on a handful of isolated incidents. After all, conventional wisdom also suggested that N.F.L. games would look like the sloppy combination of a kindergarten fire drill and a medieval peasant revolt because of the cancellation of those all-important preseason rehearsals. In fact, play has been crisp over the first two weeks. Also, Week 1 was (by N.F.L. standards) relatively light on injuries. Some teams have been harder hit so far than others. The Broncos, for example, lost the All-Pro defender Von Miller during camp and quarterback Drew Lock for two to six weeks to a shoulder injury on Sunday, in addition to Sutton and others.

* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.

* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. Pointing fingers at individual coaches or organizations would be inappropriate. Team-by-team training regimens vary wildly in normal circumstances and surely varied even more as coaches and team staff adjusted on the fly. While most organizations used the best available sports science to keep players at close to football shape, a few may have told the guys to rub some dirt on the pandemic and go straight to the blocking sleds. Some teams just have notoriously rotten injury luck, even when jogging through spring walk-throughs. The Philadelphia Eagles, for example, were fortunate this year that half of their roster didn't electrocute themselves while logging onto Zoom meetings.

The new turf at MetLife Stadium is also a suspect in this week's injury mystery, with 49ers players referring to it after Sunday's game as ""sticky"" and ""trash."" Subtle defects in a playing surface can have a major impact on elite athletes performing at peak capacity and effort, which explains why the Jets weren't affected. The N.F.L. is reportedly investigating the MetLife situation in advance of Sunday's 49ers-Giants game. If the turf really does exacerbate injuries, the 49ers may have to call Joe Montana and Jerry Rice out of retirement to get them through the season. While Sunday's list appears unusually long, the inclusion of big names often turns injuries into a bigger story than the typical weekly rundown of battered offensive linemen and backups. The losses of Barkley and McCaffrey, in particular, were a major blow to millions of fantasy football enthusiasts. Forget the 49ers or Broncos: The real crisis this week is that your cousin Carmine's Metuchen Murder Hornets will use up all of their fantasy waiver points. This year's N.F.L. injury uptick even appears to be slightly behind schedule. There's typically an annual outcry to curtail or eradicate the preseason in mid-August, at the precise moment when a handful of noteworthy preseason injuries dovetails with midday television sports-talk hosts' mounting boredom with training camp news. In past years, the same players hurt on Sunday might have gotten hurt weeks earlier in a game that didn't even count to their team's record. That wouldn't have made their injuries less devastating, personally or to their franchises, but that timing would also have made the news less immediate and dramatic. The simple truth is that most football injuries are not caused by disruptions in conditioning routines or the friction coefficient of the playing surface, but by huge men crashing at full speed into one another. Lock, for example, was hurt when Pittsburgh Steelers defender Bud Dupree slammed his shoulder to the ground. Bosa's leg twisted at an unnatural angle when he was driven backward by a blocker onto a pile. Nothing that happened in June or August could really have protected them.

The truncated off-season is a possible contributing factor in some cases, but the league's pandemic procedures also mean that teams are more capable of coping with injuries than they would be in a typical year. Practice squads are expanded, injured reserve protocols are more flexible, and teams are (theoretically) ready to call upon free-agent reinforcements, whether to play through a coronavirus outbreak or a bunch of high ankle sprains. So while the 49ers' playoff hopes are in jeopardy, the Giants' latest rebuilding plan is in peril and many well-known players face weeks or months of challenging rehabilitation, the current N.F.L. injury rash will have no more impact on the league itself than many others had in the past. Meanwhile, the annual argument about whether the preseason is helpful or harmful will wage on until sports medicine discovers optimal practice procedures that get players fully ready to play without subjecting them to undue strain. N.F.L. coaches will then reject those procedures because they sound too scientific and not enough like ""real football.""",Conventional football wisdom suggests player health would benefit from either more — or less — preparation.,8f23304d-251b-54d6-9830-fef59d87a4fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/23/sports/23nfl-tanier-1/23nfl-tanier-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=622567a3b489c469f52cac09e571e3ce51882eba2c391095a6dfa2b307c9fbfc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,It stands to reason that no amount of training could have prevented 49ers defender Nick Bosa's knee from bending awkwardly against the Jets on Sunday.,8f23304d-251b-54d6-9830-fef59d87a4fc,N24News/imgs/8f23304d-251b-54d6-9830-fef59d87a4fc.jpg,9
Health,Treatment Offers Hope for Imprisoned California Siblings,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/health/california-13-kids-siblings.html,"The California case in which 13 siblings were found imprisoned at home earlier this week is shocking, but not without precedent. Lurid cases have come to light over the years of children locked in closets and basements, held captive by parents who have crumbled under the weight of drugs, extreme religious conviction, personality disorders or their own abusive backgrounds. The good news, trauma experts say, is that recovery is indeed possible. Victims can reclaim their lives. ""The clinical data is encouraging,"" said John A. Fairbank, co-director of the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. ""There are good treatments available for children seriously abused and traumatized."" In particular, said Dr. Fairbank, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke, good results have been shown with a relatively short-term cognitive behavioral therapy tailored for trauma patients, an approach developed in the early 1990s but widely disseminated in the last 15 years.

A significant hurdle to recovery for the California siblings and children in analogous situations, said psychologists, is that their captors were not stranger-kidnappers but their parents. ""In doing the healing work, you look at what the patient's support systems are, "" said Priscilla Dass-Brailsford, a trauma psychologist and an adjunct professor in the department of psychiatry at Georgetown University. ""The biggest supports are parents and family. These kids don't have that. The parents were the aggressors."" Experts interviewed for this article, who underscored that they had no direct knowledge of the California case, said that because the siblings' primal assurance of unconditional love and safety had been ripped away, they would almost certainly struggle to trust and attach to future supportive figures. ""The notion that this was done by parents increases a child's helplessness and hopelessness,"" said Nora J. Baladerian, a Los Angeles psychologist who often treats traumatized individuals. Dr. Dass-Brailsford compared the 13 siblings' situation to that of prisoners of war, who have been deprived of food, freedom and sufficient nurturing.

""One glimmer of hope is that they did not go through this alone,"" she said. ""Prisoners of war are isolated as part of their torture. These children at least had each other."" Before formal therapy can begin, the siblings must be placed in a safe, nurturing environment where kind treatment will be a positive constant they can rely upon, experts said. They added that keeping as many siblings together as possible would be important, to sustain their bonds.

Daniel L. Davis, a forensic psychologist in Columbus, Ohio who has treated victims and perpetrators and evaluates children for juvenile court, said that there is not one behavioral model that adequately describes a typical parent perpetrator. ""There are risk factors, certainly,"" he said. A list might include a prior history of abuse, domestic violence, and a cluster of personality disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Such people, he said, might be overly emotional, unpredictable, manipulative and exploitative. But like other trauma experts, Dr. Davis emphasized that children can be remarkably resilient. He treated an elementary school-age boy whose parents had kept him locked away for such a long period that the child showed significant developmental delays. ""But with intensive treatment and real effort by a support team, his growth was impressive,"" said Dr. Davis. ""His parents were sent to prison."" Other examples of children locked away from society by parents do occasionally emerge. A documentary ""The Wolfpack"" tells the story of seven siblings isolated in a Lower East Side apartment by their father. In 2015, three siblings were found locked by their parents in a urine-and-feces infested room in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. That same year, a teenage girl in Murfreesboro, Tenn., was also discovered having been locked in her bedroom for months by her parents, who had allowed her three siblings to travel at will.

Dr. Davis said that while poverty is an element in many cases, it is certainly not a signature characteristic; indeed in the California case, the family lived in a middle-class neighborhood and the father, David Allen Turpin, had reportedly once been employed as an engineer. But poverty-afflicted situations may come to light more often, Dr. Davis noted, ""because the perpetrators don't have the resources to keep shielding from public scrutiny."" Formal treatment begins after children are placed in a secure home and assessed for trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder. They may be unwilling or unable to describe their experience. Nightmares may roil them. The slightest trigger -- the rattle of keys, for example -- might send them into a hysterical tantrum. They may seem hyper-aroused or vigilant, ever alert and cringing, braced to flee or fight. Younger children may act out the trauma as they play; for others, the emotional pain may be so overwhelming that they seem numb. ""But the majority of these children can bounce back, "" said Anthony P. Mannarino, director of the Center for Traumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. ""I'm not saying they'll forget it but they can find a way to go forward."" Dr. Mannarino is a co-developer of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The typical treatment, he said, is 12 to 16 sessions. First, a therapist works with a child to manage terrifying thoughts and feelings about the experience. Next a therapist helps the child gradually discuss the trauma. ""Those memories are really scary,"" Dr. Mannarino said. ""Maybe the parents said, 'You deserve what you're getting, it's your fault,' and the child may have internalized shame. Helping them talk and processing that distortion gives them a chance to understand that they are not to blame."" Finally, TF-CBT involves the child's new caregivers. ""We work with them to understand that the child's behavior expresses what happened to the child, as opposed to who they really are,"" said Dr. Mannarino.","Cases of children isolated and abused by parents are rare but not unheard-of, say experts. Many recover.",f0dd9b23-1faa-599d-ac4a-6d6f1d04e5ce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/18/science/18CHILDREN1/18CHILDREN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b8b84c4be56e6c4581bcd502b4b6eb2ee4bfa067ab90efefef56784448db5910&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Members of the news media gathered outside the home of David Allen and Louise Anna Turpin in Perris, Calif., where the couple's 13 children were found imprisoned earlier this week.",f0dd9b23-1faa-599d-ac4a-6d6f1d04e5ce,N24News/imgs/f0dd9b23-1faa-599d-ac4a-6d6f1d04e5ce.jpg,1
Travel,Suddenly Considering Travel Insurance? You're Not Alone.,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/travel/travel-insurance-europe-terrorism.html,"If the attacks in Nice, Brussels and Paris have you thinking about travel insurance, you're not alone. Industry experts say that consumer interest in terrorism and trip cancellation coverage has spiked after each attack. ""Since Brussels, really, we've seen that number growing and growing,"" said Rachael Taft, a spokeswoman for Squaremouth.com, a travel insurance comparison site. ""So it's definitely top of mind."" After the attacks in Paris and Brussels, Squaremouth.com saw more travelers purchasing trip cancellation policies and searching specifically for terrorism coverage, especially for popular European destinations. The company said that the number of customers searching for terrorism coverage increased by an average of 167 percent in the month after each of the attacks. Also in the month after each attack, Squaremouth.com's trip cancellation sales were 19 percent higher than in the same period the previous year.

Other companies said that they were experiencing a similar trend. ""Unfortunately as a result of activity like this, we do see a slight uptick in people that are interested in travel insurance; it makes them think of risk,"" said John Cook, the founder of QuoteWright.com, a travel insurance comparison and shopping site. ""We just hate to see events like this happen."" ""Rates don't fluctuate due to events,"" Ms. Taft said. ""Travel insurance rates are heavily regulated."" So are the policies. Mr. Cook said that insurance policies will not suddenly change because of attacks. ""You're not going to see changes in policy language next week, or next month, or three months from now,"" he said. Today, many travel insurance policies include coverage for terrorism. Ever since the attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11, that has been fairly standard, Ms. Taft said. Companies such as Squaremouth.com even have tabs on their websites so that travelers can search for policies with coverage for terrorism. At QuoteWright.com, consumers can compare such rates, or call to speak with an insurance agent about which policy may best suit them.

Keep in mind that policies that include terrorism coverage have fine print that experts advise travelers to read carefully. ""Most travel insurance policies cover terrorism in very narrowly defined ways,"" Mr. Cook said. This is particularly so when it comes to canceling or interrupting a trip already in progress. For example, he said, a policy may say that a terrorist event must have occurred within 30 days before your scheduled departure date. And a policy may exclude coverage for a terrorist attack if one has already occurred in the same place within a certain time period. Christina Tunnah, the regional manager for the Americas for World Nomads, a travel insurance company, said the two major factors that determine whether you have a claim are when you bought the insurance, and how exactly your travels were affected during a terrorist event. For instance, a road closure in the aftermath of an attack that causes you to miss your flight would likely be covered. (When attacks happen, travel insurance companies often post alerts on their websites to help answer consumer questions, and to let them know if an event has, in fact, been officially declared a terrorist attack, which may be required to pursue a claim.) That said, policy rules are not necessarily hard and fast. ""Always, always call,"" Ms. Tunnah advises travelers who have purchased insurance and are uncertain whether their trip is covered. In some cases the policy you have may say you're not covered if you cancel a trip to a place that has just suffered an attack -- but the insurer may be flexible. ""Traditionally insurance doesn't cover fear,"" Ms. Tunnah said, ""Yet there are some practicalities that might cause a travel insurance company to make an exception. It's always very case by case."" She and others in the travel insurance industry point out that travelers are still more likely to die from a disease or, say, from being hit by lightning, than from a terrorist attack. ""My advice that I've told clients is travel on,"" Mr. Cook said. ""If you don't travel, then you're actually accomplishing what the terrorists want to do.""","Consumer interest in terrorism and trip cancellation coverage has grown in the wake of attacks in Europe, though rates and policies remain unchanged.",a95789f2-bac4-586b-bb4e-278b416b367b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/24/travel/24UPDATE/24UPDATE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5178d77aa3ead9ed3feb949638f50d06fda8c669bf80a057cff4ba123d08b9e6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Passengers wait at a check-in counter at Fiumicino Airport in Rome on July 18.,a95789f2-bac4-586b-bb4e-278b416b367b,N24News/imgs/a95789f2-bac4-586b-bb4e-278b416b367b.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,Fashion Steps Up at Standing Rock,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/02/fashion/standing-rock-dakota-access-pipeline-pyer-moss.html,"Kerby Jean-Raymond, the founder of the independent, critically acclaimed fashion label Pyer Moss, planned to attend more than a dozen events at Art Basel Miami Beach this weekend, including an exhibition that showcases some of his label's shoes. Instead, he'll be flying to North Dakota. Mr. Jean-Raymond is among a number of designers and brands that are responding to the basic needs of demonstrators fighting to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline from being built near the Standing Rock Reservation out of concern for the environment and Native American ancestral lands. Activists have requested nylon coveralls, heavy-duty sleeping bags, gloves, wool clothes and blankets, along with monetary donations, on their own websites and on Amazon. After all, temperatures in Cannon Ball, N.D., the town near which protesters have gathered, range from highs in the low 30s to single digits. And it's not about to get any warmer. On Monday, Gov. Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota cited ""anticipated harsh weather conditions"" when issuing a mandatory evacuation order.

Exacerbating the effects of the cold are the water cannons that the police have used against protesters, causing early signs of hypothermia in some. Over the last several days, Mr. Jean-Raymond, 30, has worked to secure an assortment of warm clothes, using his personal funds and his connections. ""I called Nike and I said, 'Instead of me keeping a couple of thousand dollars worth of sneakers that I'm not going to wear, let me send these back to you,'"" Mr. Jean-Raymond said. ""'Let me get some thermals instead.'"" In exchange for the free sneakers, he received credits that he then used to purchase thermal clothing. He has also personally purchased outerwear from Uniqlo. It's not the first time the designer, whose youthful but streamlined collections often engage with heavy topics, has taken a dive into activism. For his spring 2016 show, Mr. Jean-Raymond prepared a short film about race relations in the United States. And two years ago, he designed a T-shirt listing names of victims of police brutality, profits from which went to the American Civil Liberties Union.

Designers with less visible profiles have also jumped in to help Standing Rock demonstrators. Bethany Yellowtail, a Los Angeles-based designer who is a member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe and who grew up on the Crow reservation in Montana, created a line of ""Protector Gear,"" including T-shirts, hoodies, water bottles and hats, with profits to go directly to the Standing Rock Sioux, the tribe leading the protests. So far, the effort has raised over $10,000, Ms. Yellowtail said. Louie Gong, founder of the brand Eighth Generation, sent 60 blankets to the Standing Rock campsite, at a cost he estimated to be about $10,000. ""It seems like a small and superficial sacrifice, however, when compared to our cousins sleeping in tents that are covered in snow,"" Mr. Gong, who grew up in the NookSack tribe, wrote in an email. Bliss and Mischief, a Los Angeles brand, is donating 15 percent of proceeds from every purchase until the end of 2016 to a cause of the customer's choice, with the Standing Rock Sioux offered as an option. And at least one major corporation is involved. Patagonia gave a $25,000 grant to the Indigenous Environmental Network, a nongovernmental organization, to support the indigenous community at Standing Rock. Ms. Yellowtail expressed enthusiasm about the outflow of support the tribes have received, but she cautioned non-Native American volunteers, whether in the fashion industry or otherwise, against blindly appropriating the cause of the tribes at Standing Rock. ""They're not asking allies to come out and speak for them, they're asking for people to stand in solidarity and be supportive,"" she said. ""Ask yourself: Are you going for your own agenda or to listen and follow protocol?"" For Mr. Jean-Raymond, the purpose of his trip is simple. ""I'm bringing as much supplies as I can out there,"" he said. ""If I can do anything past that, I'll do it. If I feel like I'm unnecessary, I'll leave.""",Brands and designers are finding ways to contribute to protesters demonstrating the Dakota Access pipeline.,6b3be640-0cff-543a-8156-98514d4d9b64,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/04/fashion/OTR/OTR-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=0bd0c0de442d587914b638dd579430e07bee00a5d453d148411168f0cfc65d23&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Kerby Jean-Raymond of Pyer Moss has found solidarity with protesters fighting to prevent the Dakota Access pipeline from being built near the Standing Rock Reservation.,6b3be640-0cff-543a-8156-98514d4d9b64,N24News/imgs/6b3be640-0cff-543a-8156-98514d4d9b64.jpg,19
Your Money,Deciding Whether to Disclose Mental Disorders to the Boss,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/15/your-money/disclosing-mental-disorders-at-work.html,"ABOUT six months ago, Patrick Ross knew things had reached a breaking point at work. An angry email he had sent to a superior -- combined with occasional temper flare-ups and brusque interactions with colleagues -- was endangering his job of two years as deputy director of communication at the United States Patent and Trademark Office. So before a scheduled meeting with his boss about these problems, Mr. Ross decided he needed to reveal something he had not told anyone outside his immediate family: He has bipolar disorder. He wrote down what he wanted to say and gave it to his supervisor the morning before the meeting. ""I didn't sleep the night before,"" Mr. Ross said. ""But I decided things had gotten bad enough."" Mr. Ross is unusual in that he has chosen to speak publicly about his experience. But he is not unusual as one of 43.7 million adults who suffer from a mental, behavioral or emotional disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. (The statistic does not include substance abuse.) That is more than 18 percent of American adults.

A 2013 Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index found that diagnosed depression alone costs companies an estimated $23 billion annually in absenteeism. And while celebrities and others who have publicized their mental health problems have to some extent reduced the stigma, that is not true in the place people spend most of their waking hours -- on the job. ""We're seeing changes in the broader culture, but we're not seeing it in the workplace,"" said Mary Killeen, a senior research associate at the Burton Blatt Institute at Syracuse University. Some of this is changing. New federal regulations strengthen the law governing the hiring and on-the-job treatment of people with physical and mental disabilities. The law applies specifically to federal contractors and subcontractors, who account for as much as 20 percent of the nation's work force. The regulations include requiring employers to encourage employees on a regular basis to voluntarily disclose their disabilities.

But even though the Americans with Disabilities Act forbids companies from firing people with mental health conditions as long as they can do the ""essential functions"" of the job as determined by the employer, people may not feel safe coming forward. And there is reason to worry. DeBorah Ingegno, who now works as a doula, a nonmedical person who assists during childbirth, said that when she was hired at a California health food store a number of years ago, she told her employer that she needed Fridays off. When asked why, ""I told her I had a group I had met with and left it at that."" Her boss then inquired casually several times about what kind of group, and after Ms. Ingegno, who lives in Hartford, Conn., felt more comfortable in the job, she revealed it was a bipolar disorder support group. While the supervisor initially seemed accepting, a week later, Ms. Ingegno was fired, and told that her illness was affecting her work. ""I was stunned. I'd been getting ample compliments from the women training me and from my boss herself,"" she said. Ms. Ingegno is now self-employed, but were that to change, she said, ""I will never again disclose a mental illness to any employer."" In one recent study of 600 people with disabilities, roughly half involving mental health, about a quarter of the respondents said they received negative responses to revealing their problems -- such as not being promoted, being treated differently or being bullied, said Sarah von Schrader, a senior research associate at Cornell University's Employment and Disability Institute. That was part of the reason Scott Stossel, editor of The Atlantic magazine, kept his severe anxiety secret for 35 years from everyone but his immediate family until his book ""My Age of Anxiety"" was published this year.

Mr. Stossel feared ""being perceived as weak or crazy, or that I would somehow compromise my professional standing,"" he said. Few will come out in the splashy way Mr. Stossel did. But choosing how to disclose, once you decide to, is crucially important. Employees often feel safer telling their supervisor than informing the human resources department, because they are afraid of having something on their permanent record, Dr. von Schrader said. The trouble is, she said, supervisors often are not trained in how to respond to such information. They frequently are not aware of the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act or even of their company's policies regarding issues such as flexible work hours. The Partnership for Workplace Mental Health, part of the American Psychiatric Association, focuses on helping employers increase awareness and reduce stigma, and posts on its website case studies of companies that have introduced programs to address the issue. Right Direction, a program started last year by the partnership and Employers Health, a national coalition, supplies employers with free fact sheets, posters and articles for company websites and other resources. Clare Miller, the director, acknowledged that far less had changed in the workplace than in society as a whole, although she said it varied by company. Still, she added, opening up at work is ""dicey."" ""If a friend asked me if I should disclose, I would talk about why she wants to,"" Ms. Miller said. In some cases, people need to tell a boss because they need accommodations, such as time off to see a psychiatrist, or even 10-minute breaks several times a day to take medication and rest.

Susan G. Goldberg, a psychologist and assistant professor of psychology at Duquesne University, who has studied the issue for years, suggests ing five factors before deciding to make a psychiatric condition known on the job: # How supportive is the person you are disclosing to likely to be? # What type of culture does the company have? Sometimes big companies are more open, sometimes it's mom and pops, she said. # Do you have a proven track record? # What is happening in the society as a whole? ""You probably don't want to disclose after a mass shooting,"" she said, when people tend to connect mental illness with violence. # Do you need to disclose everything about the condition, or would it be better to be selective? The problem too often becomes a Catch-22, experts say. People associate mental health issues with those who act out and do not see those who successfully manage their problems, because they often keep them private. Yet if there is to be more acceptance and understanding of psychological disorders, those are the very people who need to speak out. And it is known that if a disclosure is accepted positively, ""people are much happier,"" Professor Goldberg said. ""It's a weight off their chest."" And research shows that systemic efforts to treat depression in the workplace reduce employee absenteeism, increase productivity and are a cost benefit to companies. Mr. Ross, whose book, ""Committed: A Memoir of the Artist's Road,"" was published in October, learned that he had Bipolar II disorder, a less severe form of the illness, when he was 25. Before his current job, he largely worked autonomously, but new medication he started five years ago gave him the confidence that he could handle a high-pressure government position. It was more difficult than he had expected. One of the symptoms of bipolar disorder, he said, is that you are not always aware when you are losing control. Now, he said, his boss, who has been very understanding, can notice and perhaps suggest that he take a break or go home. Mr. Ross says he is grateful for the support, but his job, a political appointment, expires in two years. By coming out, he wonders, ""Have I just curtailed future employment activities?""","Telling an employer or supervisor about a mental disability carries potential risks and benefits, so it merits careful consideration.",3c894e79-1c52-5d5d-b0c6-34310aec1401,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/11/15/business/Shortcuts/Shortcuts-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=406&w=600&s=45a0206f74493f808d01260667cdacb5107c4579fa5f6646130f7ad31c7064dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"""Things had gotten bad enough"" so that Patrick Ross, a deputy director of communications for the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, decided it was time to divulge that he had bipolar disorder.",3c894e79-1c52-5d5d-b0c6-34310aec1401,N24News/imgs/3c894e79-1c52-5d5d-b0c6-34310aec1401.jpg,21
Art & Design,Rooftop Terrace at Brooklyn Children's Museum Is Set to Open,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/arts/design/rooftop-terrace-at-brooklyn-childrens-museum-is-set-to-open.html,"It's taken nearly a decade, but the rooftop space at the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Crown Heights is finally ready for the small visitors it is intended to serve. And it arrives with an impressive design pedigree.

That starts with the 118-year-old museum's current building, designed by Hugh Hardy (who died in March) and then extensively remodeled by Rafael Vinoly in 2008. Mr. Vinoly's reimagining, which gave the museum its arresting facade of curved yellow walls, included a 20,000-square-foot terrace on the first-floor roof, conceived as a gathering space.

Another high-profile architect, Toshiko Mori, designed a pavilion for the terrace, stretching translucent high-tech fabric over a framework of tubular steel. That structure, looking like a winged creature, has perched there since 2015, visible from the neighboring Brower Park and accessible to those attending special events -- but not open to day-to-day visitors. The museum lacked the money to make the terrace a fully functioning space. But with grants totaling $575,000 from elected officials, channeled through the New York State Dormitory Authority, the museum was able to hire Future Green Studio, a rising Brooklyn landscape architecture firm, to make it ""a gateway to nature,"" Stephanie Hill Wilchfort, the museum's president and chief executive, said during an inspection on Tuesday.

In one corner, a mini woodland has sprung up with a boardwalk zigzagging through it. Sweetbay magnolia and sassafras trees have materialized. More plants -- as well as chairs and tables -- are on the way, Ms. Wilchfort said. She said the space would open in August, during a Senegalese drum and dance festival.","A decade after it began, an outdoor green space for the museum's small visitors is finally ready, and it arrives with an impressive design pedigree.",1ca9117e-68c5-59cc-bc97-511598128efd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/16/arts/16ROOFTOP/16ROOFTOP-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=446&w=852&s=2e4658b1f72fd1e6ebe7c5ee2526e5c5f78231068666fc762ff7d1f637727176&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The outdoor space at the Brooklyn Children's Museum in Crown Heights is to officially open the first weekend in August.,1ca9117e-68c5-59cc-bc97-511598128efd,N24News/imgs/1ca9117e-68c5-59cc-bc97-511598128efd.jpg,14
Media,"If Bernie Bernstein Existed, He'd Be a Terrible Journalist",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/business/media/bernie-bernstein-washington-post-fake.html,"If Bernie Bernstein were a real reporter, he would not last long at The Washington Post or any other legitimate news organization. Fortunately, he is not real. But an unknown number of people in Alabama got a call this week from a man claiming to be Mr. Bernstein, supposedly a reporter for The Post on a clumsy expedition to dig up dirt on Roy Moore, the Republican candidate for senator. Al Moore, a pastor in Creola who is not related to Roy Moore, played a voice mail from a private number to WKRG-TV, a local news station. Hi this is Bernie Bernstein. I'm a reporter for The Washington Post calling to find out if anyone at this address is a female between the ages of 54 to 57 years old, willing to make damaging remarks about candidate Roy Moore for a reward of between $5,000 and $7,000. We will not be fully investigating these claims however we will make a written report.

""The call's description of our reporting methods bears no relationship to reality,"" Marty Baron, the newspaper's executive editor, said in a statement. ""We are shocked and appalled that anyone would stoop to this level to discredit real journalism."" It should be noted that many people hear the heavily accented voice saying ""Lenny Bernstein,"" which is the name of a health reporter at the paper. The caller is not him.

We get it, a lot of people distrust the media and suspect the worst out of reporters. But here's what the call got wrong. Kris Coratti, a Washington Post spokeswoman, said the publication has a policy that specifically prohibits paying sources. (So does New York Times policy.)

'We will not be fully investigating these claims' That would be a very silly thing for a reporter to say. It would be like a plumber saying ""we will not fully fix the leak in your pipe."" ""A journalist worried about his or her reputation would only want to put verified or supported claims in a story carrying their names,"" said Andrew Seaman, the ethics chair for the Society of Professional Journalists.

An ethical reporter would also be unlikely to phrase their request the way the robocall did. Asking for someone ""willing to make damaging remarks"" would be brazenly partisan in a way most mainstream reporters try to avoid. ""Journalists wouldn't normally ask such leading questions,"" Mr. Seaman said. ""They're after the truth, whether that leads to a scandal or exoneration."" There's also the matter of the name itself. It seems intended to play into anti-Semitic sentiment.","A pastor got a call from someone pretending to be a Washington Post reporter. The caller badly misrepresented, or misunderstood, basic journalism ethics.",b7557a5b-77a7-528d-8074-766ee5d74b5c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/16/autossell/16xp-wapo-1/16xp-wapo-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=b0702f5ff8baac545ac8cbb3e3064d0c698ae721b53f40094c62eea46d3c9741&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A robocall purporting to be from a Washington Post reporter who does not exist offered money for negative information about Roy Moore.,b7557a5b-77a7-528d-8074-766ee5d74b5c,N24News/imgs/b7557a5b-77a7-528d-8074-766ee5d74b5c.jpg,16
Education,Program to Bridge the Gap With Parents Draws Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/19/education/chicago-program-to-bridge-gap-with-parents-draws-fire.html,"Chicago Public School officials are making big changes during their first year in office, but there's a group of people feeling shut out once again -- parents. Despite a well-publicized commitment to involve parents in the city's public education system, some of them are not happy with how Mayor Rahm Emanuel and his school team are following through. And some say they are still not familiar with the new Office of Community and Family Engagement. ""I've heard of the new department, but I quite honestly have no idea what they do,"" said Jonathan Goldman, a parent and Local School Council member at Drummond Montessori School, a sought-after magnet program. The district has long been accused of excluding parents from its decision-making process. ""To be fair, C.P.S. has never, under any recent administration, been a bastion of parent engagement,"" Mr. Goldman said.

To address that reputation, Jean-Claude Brizard, C.P.S. chief executive, created the office last July and said it would focus solely on parents and school communities. He said the new office would concentrate the responsibilities of several former departments -- the Office of Local School Council relations, the Office of External Affairs and other now-defunct departments -- into one unit that would report directly to him. Six months later, only 10 of 18 mid-level positions -- those who would work with each of the district's geographical networks -- have been filled. ""There's so much ground to cover, we're not going to get the infrastructure built in six months,"" Mr. Brizard said. ""But it's one that's going to evolve or be evolving in the next six months to a year."" Jamiko Rose, a former organizer for the Organization of the North East, a community group, was hired in September to head the office. In her first interview since taking office, Ms. Rose said she spends much of her time developing relationships with parents and community leaders and ensuring that they ""even know that this office exists."" She is also working on building a citywide parent advisory council. But while the office is being put together, parents have been organizing against key policies like a seven-and-a-half-hour school day, proposed school closings and turnarounds. They've sent out press releases, conducted surveys, circulated petitions, held referendums and spoken at school board meetings.

Public backlash is not unusual when the district announces a list of schools it plans to close or overhaul, but it has been heightened this year because a state law passed last fall was intended to create a more open decision-making process that would allow public participation in advance of school board actions. Legislators who serve on a task force overseeing the process say the school district is not in compliance with the new law. The task force recently issued a report outlining irregularities that ""suggest at a minimum, an attempt to 'skew' the results of the lawfully required public input process."" Ms. Rose defended her office's performance during the latest round of school closings and turnaround hearings. ""Given the capacity that we had at the time,"" she said, ""we did a really great job."" A coalition of Local School Council members, whose schools are on the list to be closed or turned around next year, filed a lawsuit against the district last week, alleging that it is in violation of the Illinois School Code because it has not worked collaboratively with the councils -- the governing bodies of most neighborhood schools -- to improve the academic performance of students. The Chicago Teachers Union helped file the lawsuit and is paying the legal fees associated with it. The nine schools represented in the lawsuit are on probation, which means their Local School Council's key powers -- approving budgets and hiring new administrators -- are revoked. Becky Carroll, a spokeswoman for the school district, provided the Chicago News Cooperative with a list of 61 meetings that officials held regarding the school closings and turnarounds. It showed no meetings held with Local School Councils. Ms. Carroll said the list was incomplete and did not include Ms. Rose's schedule. The district's decision to require a longer school day has also been a contentious issue for parents.","Despite Mayor Rahm Emanuel's well-publicized commitment to involve parents in Chicago's public schools, some of them are not happy with how he and his team are following through.",5176480f-2c21-5202-adae-5bce3e86b9f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/19/us/19CNCROSE/19CNCROSE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=388&w=600&s=7023bc015164d6dd5fca55820dfc8216025fe1664c9bc7c49192612ac6c338e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Parents at a rally in Merrionette Park had hoped to question Chicago Public Schools officials.,5176480f-2c21-5202-adae-5bce3e86b9f1,N24News/imgs/5176480f-2c21-5202-adae-5bce3e86b9f1.jpg,22
Sports,N.B.A. Suspends Season After Player Tests Positive for Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/sports/basketball/nba-season-suspended-coronavirus.html,"The N.B.A. abruptly suspended its season on Wednesday after a Utah Jazz player was found to have tested positive for coronavirus moments before a game began in Oklahoma City. The league announced that the suspension would begin on Thursday, but the final game of Wednesday's slate, between the Sacramento Kings and New Orleans Pelicans, was canceled soon after the announcement. It was a surreal day for the N.B.A. -- starting with the news that one team, the Golden State Warriors, was barring fans from home games, and ending with the season in peril for the entire league. ""The N.B.A. will use this hiatus to determine next steps for moving forward in regard to the coronavirus pandemic,"" the league said in its statement Wednesday night.

The Jazz were seconds from tipping off against the Thunder at Oklahoma City's Chesapeake Energy Arena on Wednesday night when the game was delayed for about 30 minutes, then called off. It was not immediately clear what was happening; in a bizarre scene, a member of the Thunder's medical staff sprinted onto the court and spoke to the referees. Players from both teams then left for their locker rooms. In a statement, the Jazz said that an unidentified player had been tested for the coronavirus after tests for influenza, strep throat and an upper respiratory infection came back negative. ""The individual's symptoms diminished over the course of today, however in a precautionary measure, and in consultation and cooperation with N.B.A. medical staff and Oklahoma health officials, the decision was made to test for Covid-19,"" the Jazz said in the statement, using the term for the disease caused by the virus. Although the team did not name the infected player, a person familiar with the situation identified him as Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert. Gobert had recently made light of fears about the coronavirus outbreak when he spoke to reporters. As the news of the season's suspension broke, Mark Cuban, the owner of the Dallas Mavericks, was shown on ESPN appearing shocked during a game between the Mavericks and the Denver Nuggets.

This is not the first time an N.B.A. season has been shortened -- the 2011 lockout, for example, limited the season to 66 games. The ripple effect of this suspension could be significant, with potentially substantial financial repercussions for the league if the hiatus is extended. The N.B.A. has already lost untold millions in revenue because of an ongoing dispute with the Chinese government. Weeks without any sort of ticket sales would affect future salary caps, which are based on revenue streams like television rights and jersey sales. In addition, the playoffs are slated to start next month -- a time when television ratings typically go up and more eyes are on the league. The N.B.A. had been under increasing pressure from public officials to stop filling its arenas with thousands of fans amid the coronavirus pandemic. After San Francisco moved on Wednesday morning to ban gatherings of more than 1,000 people for at least two weeks, the Warriors became the first team to announce plans to play home games without fans in attendance -- through at least March 21. Other teams had been debating whether they should do the same. Their calculus was instantly upended by the news of Gobert's test result, and the N.B.A. was left reeling -- again -- amid a season that has been full of challenges. In October, the league became embroiled in controversy after an executive for the Houston Rockets tweeted a message supportive of Hong Kong's pro-democracy protests, just as the Lakers and the Nets were staging exhibitions in China. In January, David Stern, the former commissioner of the N.B.A. and one of its most influential figures, died several weeks after having a brain hemorrhage. Then, more tragedy: Kobe Bryant, the iconic player Lakers guard, was among nine people killed in a helicopter crash outside Los Angeles on Jan. 26. Bryant's 13-year-old daughter, Gianna, a budding basketball star in her own right, was among the victims.",The league said the suspension would begin after Wednesday night's games.,5fe6011c-267b-5943-b3d8-7827d98fe0ff,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/11/sports/11nbapostponed1/merlin_170379348_77f23d72-ac18-4def-a08f-cec3f01fc161-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=348603dc82f2f290d3ce69dd6562452745d82049bcc5d158edd28a6844f51e69&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A message on the video board at Oklahoma City's Chesapeake Energy Arena announced the postponement of the Thunder's game against the Utah Jazz on Wednesday.,5fe6011c-267b-5943-b3d8-7827d98fe0ff,N24News/imgs/5fe6011c-267b-5943-b3d8-7827d98fe0ff.jpg,9
Technology,Google Self-Driving Car Unit Accuses Uber of Using Stolen Technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/23/technology/google-self-driving-waymo-uber-otto-lawsuit.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Waymo, the self-driving car business spun out of Google's parent company, claimed in a federal lawsuit on Thursday that Uber was using intellectual property stolen by one of Google's former project leaders. In a federal court filing in San Francisco, Waymo said Anthony Levandowski, who runs Uber's autonomous car division, downloaded 14,000 files from Google a month before leaving to start his own self-driving car company, Otto. Uber acquired Otto in August for $680 million, about seven months after Mr. Levandowski left Google. ""Otto and Uber have taken Waymo's intellectual property so that they could avoid incurring the risk, time, and expense of independently developing their own technology,"" the company said in the filing. ""Ultimately, this calculated theft reportedly netted Otto employees over half a billion dollars and allowed Uber to revive a stalled program, all at Waymo's expense."" Uber did not respond to requests for comment. In its filing, Waymo said it was inadvertently copied on an email from one of its suppliers with drawings of Uber's circuit board design for its lidar technology, short for light detection and ranging, "" that are laser-based sensors used in self-driving cars. Waymo said Uber's design bore ""a striking resemblance"" to its proprietary and highly secret design and infringed on Waymo's patents.

The suit accuses Uber of stealing trade secrets, infringing on patents and competing unfairly in an effort to catch up on autonomous vehicle technology. Otto was the brainchild of a handful of former Google employees who pioneered autonomous vehicle research at the search giant. Mr. Levandowski, who had been at Google nine years, led that effort. He is a prominent figure in the world of self-driving vehicles, having worked on the technology for more than a decade and achieving some degree of renown as a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, in 2004, when he designed a self-driving motorcycle that was entered in the Pentagon's first contest for autonomous vehicles. Later, when Google began working on self-driving cars, it acquired Mr. Levandowski's start-up, 510 Systems.

Mr. Levandowski left Google in early 2016 to found Otto with Lior Ron, who also was experienced in autonomous vehicle research and digital mapping. Waymo noted in its suit that the sale to Uber closed shortly after Mr. Levandowski received his final ""multimillion dollar"" compensation payment from Google. Companies in Silicon Valley and Detroit are betting big on self-driving car technology. And the intense interest has spawned a string of expensive investments and lawsuits. Last year, General Motors paid more than $1 billion for Cruise Automation, an autonomous vehicle technology start-up, and Ford recently announced plans to invest $1 billion over five years in Argo AI, an artificial intelligence start-up formed in December.

In January, Tesla filed a lawsuit against Sterling Anderson, a former director of the company's Autopilot program, saying that he broke his employment contract by trying to recruit Tesla employees to join a new self-driving car company. Tesla's suit, filed against Mr. Anderson and his partner Chris Urmson, a former Google employee, also claims that Mr. Anderson took proprietary information and tried to cover his tracks by destroying information. In December, Google's parent company, Alphabet, said that its seven-year-old autonomous vehicle project was spinning off from its research lab X and would operate as a stand-alone company called Waymo. Alphabet said its decision to spin out Waymo was a signal that the company thought its self-driving technology had advanced beyond research project status and was ready for commercialization. Waymo executives have said it is open to using the technology in many ways, including a ride-hailing service to compete with Uber.

For Uber, Otto represents a significant bet on the future of transportation. Mr. Levandowski was named vice president of Uber's self-driving technology, and he reports directly to Travis Kalanick, the company's chief executive. Mr. Levandowski leads Uber's Advanced Technologies Center in Pittsburgh, the epicenter of the company's testing and self-driving efforts. Uber has said it could be years before self-driving vehicles enter wide mainstream use. But the company has already deployed early tests in Pittsburgh and Tempe, Ariz., where the public can travel in prototype vehicles. In Fort Collins, Colo., Otto recently completed its first self-driving truck delivery, a 120-mile beer delivery for Budweiser. Uber has also struck a deal with Volvo to jointly develop a self-driving vehicle, the XC-90; early versions of it have been released in some cities.

In December, Uber ran into opposition to a test of its self-driving Volvo XC-90s in San Francisco, an operation the California Department of Motor Vehicles said was illegal because Uber did not hold the proper permits. One week later, Uber relented, redirecting its test to Tempe and pulling a fleet of its self-driving cars out of the Bay Area. Uber, now privately valued at nearly $70 billion, has raised a dizzying amount of money from venture capitalists around Silicon Valley. One of its early investors was GV, the venture capital arm of Alphabet. In August, David Drummond, a longtime Alphabet executive who was instrumental in GV's $250 million investment in Uber in 2013, stepped down from his seat on Uber's board of directors as it became increasingly clear the two companies were on a collision course.

It has been a difficult week for Uber. The company is still reeling from a blog post written by Susan Fowler, a former Uber employee, who claimed she was sexually harassed by a manager at the company and was ignored when she complained to the human resources department. The company said it was investigating Ms. Fowler's claims and other concerns about a toxic workplace culture. Mitch and Freada Kapor, early investors in Uber, wrote in a blog post on Thursday that they are frustrated with the company's inability to change its culture, despite their attempts to help. They also expressed concern about the independence of the investigation, which will be led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former United States attorney general, and Arianna Huffington, an Uber board member. Mr. Holder has been paid to work on behalf of Uber since at least 2016, they wrote, and Ms. Huffington's board seat also compromises her independence. Mr. Holder and Tammy Albarran, a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling who is working on the investigation, said the inquiry would be ""thorough, impartial and objective.""","A lawsuit says an employee took thousands of secret files on self-driving car design when he left Google to start his own company, later sold to Uber.",afa50e0b-0b6e-5eec-9403-44faa9579f33,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/24/business/24UBER1/24UBER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=00c469a5a507d3d7cb625446648cd5299b87b37e2a32b28e4cff1319e9b61d37&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An Uber vehicle mapping the streets and topography of Pittsburgh last year in preparation for the use of driverless cars.,afa50e0b-0b6e-5eec-9403-44faa9579f33,N24News/imgs/afa50e0b-0b6e-5eec-9403-44faa9579f33.jpg,20
Media,"President Trump, the Animatronic Version, Comes to Disney World",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/18/business/media/president-trump-disney-world-hall-of-presidents.html,"And, yes, he speaks.

After a delay that prompted online conspiracy theories, the most common one being that Disney was trying to silence Mr. Trump, Disney World unveiled an audio-animatronic robot in his life-size likeness on Monday as part of its famed Hall of Presidents exhibit.

The revamped 25-minute show finds Mr. Trump, or at least a silicone-skinned version of him, joining his 43 presidential predecessors. He stands next to a seated Abraham Lincoln in the center of the stage with his signature hair, his suit jacket unbuttoned and his tie dangling extra low.

""Above all, to be American is to be an optimist -- to believe that we can always do better -- and that the best days of our great nation are still ahead of us,"" the Trump figure says.

The Hall of Presidents, in the Liberty Square area of the Magic Kingdom, one of four theme parks in Orlando, Fla., that constitute Disney World, was closed on Jan. 17, three days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. ""Currently being prepared to welcome our new president,"" a red, white and blue sign at the entrance has read since.","Mr. Trump joined the Hall of Presidents in the Magic Kingdom on Monday.

Movies,'Helmut Newton: The Bad and the Beautiful' Review: Man With a Camera,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/movies/helmut-newton-the-bad-and-the-beautiful-review.html,"Any artist who visibly raises the hackles of Susan Sontag deserves a closer look, and Gero von Boehm's ""Helmut Newton: The Bad and the Beautiful"" is eager to oblige. Yet this brisk documentary, steered by the fond recollections and admiring voices of famous beauties -- Charlotte Rampling, Catherine Deneuve, Isabella Rossellini, Grace Jones -- is as averse to analysis as its irrepressible subject.

Not that Newton, a photographer of uncommon wit and unabashed eroticism (he died in a car crash in 2004), would have appreciated being called an artist. (To him, ""art"" was a dirty word.) As a Jewish teenager living in Berlin under the Nazis, he was inspired by Leni Riefenstahl's images of athletes and apprenticed to the theatrical photographer Madame Yva (who was later killed in a concentration camp).

These influences flourished in his often controversial fashion shoots for Vogue in the 1960s and beyond. An avowed lover of breasts, legs and attitude, he could turn stiletto heels and skintight skirts into weapons of empowerment, drawing the eye to the muscled flesh beneath. His statuesque nudes, positioned as unattainable Valkyries, were immune to the stares of the men who often crouched below them in the frame. Like those of the artist Robert Crumb, Newton's compositions could waver between objectification and celebration, animosity and desire. Yet ""Helmut Newton"" alights only glancingly on their more troubling readings, leaving Sontag's accusations of misogyny (here voiced on a French talk show) essentially unplumbed.

What dominates instead is a gossipy portrait of a charmingly naughty boy whose genius is perhaps best appreciated on a second viewing with the sound off and the eyes wide open.

Movies,Can Woody Allen Work in Hollywood Again?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/28/movies/woody-allen-dylan-farrow.html,"Hollywood says it's done with Harvey Weinstein, James Toback, Kevin Spacey and other figures ousted for misconduct through the #MeToo movement. But what about Woody Allen? His film distributor, Amazon, the presenters of his musical ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" and colleagues are now grappling with renewed scrutiny of allegations that Mr. Allen molested his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow in 1992 when she was a child. Mr. Allen has steadfastly denied the claims and was not charged. But at a moment when women's voices and stories have been amplified as never before, Ms. Farrow's account carries more force -- as even defenders of Mr. Allen are starting to acknowledge. ""I do feel that it's an escalation,"" Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen's sister and longtime producer, said in an interview, calling #MeToo a tool that has been used for ""ulterior motives."" Ms. Farrow told The Times that she was using the movement as it was intended, to shine a light on ""the truth"" about sexual abuse. In conversations with Hollywood executives and insiders, allegiances were split between Mr. Allen, the Oscar-winning icon of 20th-century cinema, and Ms. Farrow, a sympathetic figure who has recently made her case powerfully on social media and in her first appearance on television.

Her allegations are not new, but the response from stars who once worked with Mr. Allen is now different. Mira Sorvino, who won an Oscar for her breakout role in Mr. Allen's ""Mighty Aphrodite,"" publicly apologized to Ms. Farrow, while others, like Colin Firth, have distanced themselves from the director. The shift raises questions about whether Mr. Allen can maintain the clout to attract A-listers to his future films -- he is at work on another screenplay -- and how much any of his projects can outrun the controversy. Ms. Aronson and others believe that it helped sink Kate Winslet's Oscar chances for Mr. Allen's 2017 film, ""Wonder Wheel."" Onscreen, another casualty could be ""A Rainy Day in New York,"" Mr. Allen's soon-to-be-completed next movie, which was financed and due to be distributed by Amazon. The company has not made any decisions about the film's future, but Amazon is having serious conversations about ending its relationship with Mr. Allen, which could leave the movie without distribution, according to two people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations. Amazon has contractual obligations to Mr. Allen and the film, one of these people noted.

Making the situation more thorny for Amazon: Roy Price, who was ousted as the head of Amazon Studios in October amid sexual harassment allegations, was the one who brought Mr. Allen to the streaming service, spending lavishly to do so. He bankrolled ""Wonder Wheel"" for an astounding $25 million, a huge step up from Mr. Allen's pre-Amazon films. (Released in December, it took in just $1.4 million at the North American box office.) After Ms. Farrow called out actors for supporting #MeToo while also working with Mr. Allen, several stars of ""Rainy Day,"" including Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Hall, publicly donated their salaries from it to charities and Time's Up, the Hollywood campaign against harassment and assault. Ms. Hall, a star of Mr. Allen's 2008 film ""Vicky Cristina Barcelona,"" worked one day on ""Rainy Day,"" but said in an Instagram post, ""I regret this decision and wouldn't make the same one today.""

Cherry Jones, the Tony- and Emmy-winning actress who also appears in ""Rainy Day,"" had a different response when asked how she felt about Mr. Allen and whether she would work with him again. ""There are those who are comfortable in their certainty. I am not. I don't know the truth,"" she told The Times. ""When we condemn by instinct our democracy is on a slippery slope."" An Amazon spokesman declined to comment on ""Rainy Day"" beyond a terse statement: ""We have not announced a release date for this film."" Ms. Aronson said Mr. Allen was still editing the movie and did not expect it to be released before next winter. At any point, the film's marketing may suffer if stars like Mr. Chalamet and Ms. Hall don't promote it -- typically a vital part of the publicity for Mr. Allen's actor-driven films. For Amazon, part of the calculation is likely about the bottom line: whether the company would be harmed financially, or reputationally, by continuing to be associated with Mr. Allen. Ms. Aronson argued that Ms. Farrow and her supporters had ""capitalized"" on the #MeToo movement to intensify attention on what the Allen camp views as discredited accusations against him. In a statement, Mr. Allen said that Ms. Farrow was ""cynically"" aligning herself with Time's Up.

Ms. Farrow's claim was investigated in 1992 and 1993 by authorities in Connecticut, where the alleged assault took place, and in New York. The investigations concluded there was no abuse. A state's attorney in Connecticut said he had probable cause to prosecute Mr. Allen but would not, to spare Ms. Farrow the pain of a court appearance at a young age. The recent fallout tilted against Mr. Allen has extended past Hollywood. On Thursday a Connecticut theater canceled a production of Mr. Allen's ""Bullets Over Broadway,"" based on his 1994 movie, citing ""the current dialogue on sexual harassment and misconduct."" The majority of Mr. Allen's stars have not weighed in. But a handful of performers, without directly addressing guilt or innocence, have expressed regret over working with Mr. Allen, or vowed not to again. Ms. Farrow's statements, in which she detailed her alleged abuse as a 7-year-old, and how she felt let down by the film community, ""made me realize that I increased another woman's pain, and I was heartbroken by that realization,"" said Greta Gerwig, who appeared in Mr. Allen's ""To Rome With Love"" in 2012. A top Hollywood strategist who spoke on the condition of anonymity to protect her professional relationships said that she would advise her clients not to work with Mr. Allen. She said a role in an Allen film would be too hard to justify -- a career choice over a possible moral stand. Others pointed to the trajectory of artists like Roman Polanski as an example of the entertainment industry's longstanding moral leniency. In the decades since Mr. Polanski fled the United States to avoid sentencing after pleading guilty to unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl, he has enjoyed a flourishing career in Europe, where audiences have been conditioned to separate the art from the artist. He continued casting top Hollywood stars and won an Oscar in 2003 for directing ""The Pianist."" (Mr. Allen has long had devoted fans, and more box office fortune, in Europe. ""Wonder Wheel,"" which has taken in $9 million overseas thus far, is due to open in France this week.)

Ms. Aronson and other partisans of Mr. Allen's contend that the efforts of the Farrow family to discredit Mr. Allen are burnished by Ronan Farrow's role, through his investigative reports in The New Yorker, in exposing Harvey Weinstein's years of alleged abuse. Mr. Farrow, Dylan's brother, has also publicly supported her. ""Ronan is in a good position now,"" Ms. Aronson said. ""He's traveling around with a halo. Unfortunately, he's wrong"" about Mr. Allen. (Mr. Farrow declined to comment.) Mr. Allen is continuing on the creative path he has followed for decades: always writing -- in addition to a screenplay, Ms. Aronson said he may be working on short stories or possibly a book -- and playing clarinet at his regular Monday-night gig at the Carlyle on the Upper East Side. ""His life hasn't changed,"" she said. But his artistic vision may be out of step with the times. His last four films have flopped at the North American box office, taking in a cumulative $26.9 million -- roughly half of which goes to theater owners -- while carrying a collective $85 million in estimated production costs, not including marketing. Poor reviews have played a role. But box office analysts say that women, in particular younger women, have grown increasingly determined to boycott his films since 2013, when Dylan Farrow first spoke in detail about her claims of abuse in an interview with Vanity Fair. Before Amazon's largess, Mr. Allen, like most indie filmmakers, financed his movies by preselling distribution rights. Even as his box office results faltered, he was able to attract continued interest from distributors by casting major stars. And he was able to cast major stars (and often persuade them to work for reduced salaries) because of his reputation as a film legend and because awards sometimes followed. But pull out one element -- the stars -- and the model could collapse.","The filmmaker is writing a new script, but stars are distancing themselves from him and his distributor, Amazon, is discussing ending their relationship.",3cfa8716-68a7-54d5-be54-1bc3bd339b1c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/29/arts/29woody/29woody-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=73215e23396474abc89105b492b65637dd1b5cc4c2daf10091829bd1e24f6751&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Woody Allen at work on &ldquo;Wonder Wheel.&rdquo; The movie has made just $1.4 million at the North American box office.,3cfa8716-68a7-54d5-be54-1bc3bd339b1c,N24News/imgs/3cfa8716-68a7-54d5-be54-1bc3bd339b1c.jpg,5
Health,"Now That Coronavirus Tests Are Free, Some Insurers Are Waiving Costs for Treatment",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/19/health/coronavirus-tests-bills.html,"Now That Coronavirus Tests Are Free, Some Insurers Are Waiving Costs for Treatment

This article was updated to reflect changes in government and insurers' policies. Policies regarding your out-of-pocket costs for coronavirus testing and treatment are changing rapidly. State insurance regulators are taking steps to limit how much you might eventually owe, and insurance companies and employers have also changed the rules for most plans to eliminate deductibles or co-payments for testing. Now insurers are starting to waive out-of-pocket costs if you need to go to the hospital, and that could reduce your bills. But it's still unclear how much you'll wind up paying, leaving public health experts worried that people who are sick may hesitate to get medical care because of concerns over bills.

But insurers and employers are taking steps to limit what you might owe. ""Almost every relevant person or entity has said something about holding consumers harmless,"" said Katherine Hempstead, a senior policy adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. With the caveat that things are shifting, here's what you should know. Is the test for the coronavirus free? I have health insurance, but my plan has a high deductible. Under the legislation just passed by Congress, testing for the coronavirus is free, as are the cost of a doctor's visit or trip to the emergency room to get the test. Worried that residents might hesitate because of the potential bills, many states, including California, New York and Washington, had already required the insurance companies they regulate to cover the cost of a test, according to a recent analysis from Georgetown University. Private insurance companies had also generally volunteered to waive any costs their members might face for the actual test. Employers who offer plans and are self-insured followed suit.

The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Federal Employee Program, which covers nearly six million federal employees, retirees and their families, previously said it would waive co-payments and deductibles for medically necessary treatment. Different Blue Cross plans have different policies, and the situation is fluid, according to the B. But a lot of fine print remains: Some of the insurers have waived cost sharing for the next two months, while others are eliminating out-of-pocket expenses only for hospital stays. Many require people to go to hospitals and doctors within their plans. Another big caveat: The companies' decisions also do not apply to the health plans they administer for employers that self-insure. Each of those companies will have to decide whether they will follow the insurers' lead. A majority of workers with job-based coverage, 61 percent, are in self-funded plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That amounts to roughly 100 million people. The federal government has also made it easier for people who have certain high-deductible plans. The Internal Revenue Service recently allowed people in those plans to have coronavirus testing and treatment covered by the plan before they meet their deductibles.

It's hard to estimate how much you could owe if you don't get a waiver, but the Kaiser Family Foundation provided some ballpark estimates for a pneumonia hospitalization and concluded that the total cost could be over $20,000 -- with an individual's out-of-pocket costs running around $1,300. All of those figures depend on what plan you have, where you get care and how serious a case you have. No one knows whether employers, insurers or the federal government will eventually decide to completely cover these costs, although Joseph R. Biden Jr., the leading Democratic contender for president, has suggested providing emergency funds to cover treatment.

And some hospital systems are putting a pause on collections. CommonSpirit Health, a Catholic chain of hospitals and clinics, says it is suspending patient billing for coronavirus testing and treatment as it sorts out how the various parties will handle patients' out-of-pocket costs. You may be at risk if you get care from someone, like an emergency room doctor or anesthesiologist, who is out of your plan's network, even if the hospital is in your network. When Kaiser did its analysis, it found that nearly one in five patients admitted to the hospital with a serious case of pneumonia faced out-of-network bills. Should I worry about my health insurer's ability to pay for the costs? Probably not. Even if they don't like them, ""insurers are used to surprises,"" said Gregory Fann, an actuary at Axene Health Partners in Temecula, Calif. ""That's what they are there for."" Most insurers have plenty of capital, and state regulators also keep an eye on them to make sure the companies can pay their medical claims. And your premiums won't go up during the current year -- insurers set their prices for a whole year so you don't have to worry about any immediate jumps in costs. But there are some predictions that next year's premiums could soar if the pandemic adds tens of billions of dollars in costs that insurers and employers must pay. Should I worry about my employer coverage? It's difficult to predict what will happen to businesses, which are under a lot of strain right now, and their ability to cover your medical claims. Companies that experience a surge in health care costs just as sales are plummeting could face a financial crisis that makes them unable to pay medical claims. What if I don't have insurance? You should be able to get covered. If you lose your job, you may qualify for Medicaid or be able to sign up for a health plan under the Affordable Care Act.

A growing number of states are also creating a special enrollment period for residents who want to sign up, and there is even some talk of the federal government making a similar decision for the marketplaces they operate. There's also talk of using the Medicaid program much more broadly to cover the uninsured. What if I end up with a big bill? ""Don't whip out your checkbook,"" said Ms. Fish-Parcham, but she also warned that you shouldn't ignore any medical bills. Contact your insurer as well as the hospital or doctor to find out if you really owe what they say you owe. Be sure to check with your state insurance department as well. You may have been billed in error.",But you could still face high medical bills. Experts advise consumers to not write a check immediately because more aid may be coming.,86efa88d-7f47-5f23-abf9-bf245e39d970,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/19/science/19VIRUS-INSURE1/19VIRUS-INSURE1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=833d171b47a2f08e1d2b83477e39eaab1b41536cd8a2ec0cbfc6116a68f43fc6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A drive-through coronavirus testing site at a ProHEALTH urgent care center in Jericho, N.Y.",86efa88d-7f47-5f23-abf9-bf245e39d970,N24News/imgs/86efa88d-7f47-5f23-abf9-bf245e39d970.jpg,1
Opinion,"Democrats, Your Time Is Running Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/28/opinion/democrats-super-tuesday.html,"It's been a week of viruses and vitriol, jittery markets and even more jittery Democrats. Panic is in the air. Things are spinning out of control. The center cannot hold because there is no center in 2020. But urgency is good. It focuses the mind. A corrupt, ignorant and inept president who has yet to face a crisis finally has something -- the coronavirus, which has the outside potential to do to the human race what climate change may do to the planet -- that he can't demagogue away. The need to replace him has never been greater. And yet, the Democratic field is badly flawed: four septuagenarians; a sensible man who looks too young to shave; two people who should have left the race weeks ago. One must emerge in time to save the republic. And so, on to the necessary elimination. We will soon be entering a short span of time that could change the world. Here are some things that have to happen now: Get out! It's the title of a great horror movie. But also a necessary public service that should be performed immediately by Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Mike Bloomberg and perhaps Elizabeth Warren.

Roughly one-third of Democrats will be voting on Super Tuesday, and the best that any of those candidates can realistically hope for is that two of them will win their home states.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" Warren may not even carry Massachusetts. She hasn't worn well, nor shown any strategic smarts. Yes, she took down Bloomberg, a paper tiger whose billions cannot buy him a joke writer, a man shown to be both insufferably paternalistic and ungracefully imperious. In Tuesday's debate, she continued to fillet him. But that fish had already been fried. She spent her considerable powers to annoy on a man who has zero delegates. She seems -- how to say this? -- gutless to take on the one person squatting in her lane. Either make the strongest case against Bernie Sanders or get out. Her fellow female senator has shown more Minnesota nice than Minnesota ice, no small thing considering she supposedly eats her salad with a comb when angry. And Klobuchar got off one of the better lines Tuesday: ""If we spend the next four months tearing our party apart, we're going to watch Donald Trump spend the next four years tearing our country apart."" Politician, heed thy advice: Be gone now for the good of two-thirds of Democrats who have yet to warm to Sanders. The likable Klobuchar would make a great vice president; having her on the ticket is one way to sway the three swing states that could earn her the job.

Mayor Pete is a delight -- intelligent, quick on his feet, a man of faith but also a man married to another man, and as such, a groundbreaker. Give him four years and some gray hair and he'll be ready for the show. Buttigieg will not win a state on Super Tuesday -- not even close -- and should give up the dream of 2020 as soon as possible. But thanks for that line on Tuesday about a general election race between a man stuck in the social mores of the 1950s and another man frozen in the revolutionary politics of the '60s. The pair of billionaires, Steyer and Bloomberg, are vanity candidates who should look in the mirror of reality. They can do the country an enormous favor by spending zillions in the general election, helping along those who are still blind to the fraud of Donald Trump. If most of the above candidates don't leave the race now, we could have a situation on Tuesday where Sanders wins, say, 30 percent of the vote in California, but no other candidate gets any pledged delegates. The threshold is 15 percent of the statewide vote. So, two-thirds of Democrats could vote for someone other than Sanders, and he would be the only one with something to show for it. That's insane. Now, to the chase: Joe Biden vs. Bernie, back where it started. Sigh. ""I'm not going to be quiet anymore!"" said Biden, trying on his alpha male. Actually, he doesn't have to shout like red-faced Bernie to prove he has a pulse. Sanders's dogmatic inflexibility is also his strength with the kids -- He's so authentic! Donald Trump makes Bernie viable. In an era of chaos, why not vote for a grumpy ideologue with a heart condition who sees the world as a class struggle. You should be careful making political predictions in our perilous era, but there is one I can make with assurance: Four more years of Trump would be catastrophic. Look what's he's already done -- attacking Supreme Court justices, trying to interfere with the rule of law, ousting good public servants to get revenge -- since impeachment.","Amy Klobuchar, Pete Buttigieg, Tom Steyer, Mike Bloomberg and perhaps Elizabeth Warren need to get out of the race.",e287a1e1-eeb9-5787-be8b-c3e9fd77e765,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/28/opinion/28egan1/28egan1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=edf7bfcfae1e1bbc1ad6cdd3f31627d660a161a8bd761c0020842d061bf01572&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The candidates for the Democratic nomination during the debate in Charleston, S.C., on Tuesday.",e287a1e1-eeb9-5787-be8b-c3e9fd77e765,N24News/imgs/e287a1e1-eeb9-5787-be8b-c3e9fd77e765.jpg,11
Global Business,Critics of Executive Pay Put Pressure on Novartis,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/business/global/for-daniel-vasella-of-novartis-78-million-to-keep-secrets.html,"LONDON -- A plan by Novartis, one of Switzerland's biggest drug makers, to pay its departing chairman $78 million to keep him from sharing his knowledge with competitors has added fuel to an already heated debate about executive pay.

The announcement of the payment to the chairman, Daniel Vasella, was made last Friday, just two weeks before a Swiss referendum to give shareholders more power to determine executive compensation. Mr. Vasella, who had previously said that he would step down as chairman at Novartis's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, is to receive the sum, 72 million Swiss francs, over six years.

In a statement, Mr. Vasella said that ""it has been very important to Novartis that I refrain from making my knowledge and know-how available to competitors and to take advantage of my experience with the company."" He added that the annual payments were ""according to fair market value"" and that he decided to use the money for ""philanthropic activities.""","The drug maker plans to pay Daniel Vasella, its departing chairman, $78 million to prevent him from sharing knowledge with competitors.",6685428a-1770-5036-9544-3d1ecd137f54,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/19/business/19novartis-web/19novartis-web-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=314&w=600&s=6db840356530ed00be451ada58a5c2122ade6ebee3c2873b44b11ec79aa0d022&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Daniel Vasella, the departing chairman of Novartis.",6685428a-1770-5036-9544-3d1ecd137f54,N24News/imgs/6685428a-1770-5036-9544-3d1ecd137f54.jpg,24
Television,Review: Who Killed Biggie and Tupac? 'Unsolved' Might Know,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/arts/television/unsolved-murders-tupac-notorious-big-review.html,"Some myths are too powerful -- too necessary -- to ever be fully undone, no matter the facts gathered to address them. Such is the case with the still-officially-unsolved deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G., Tupac and Biggie, gunned down six months apart two decades ago, a cruel extermination of hip-hop's elite. They became martyrs, and also -- as the years passed and their killers were never brought to justice -- symbols of a kind of institutional neglect, failed originally by the genre they loved and, in death, by the police. So the most conspicuous aspect of ""Unsolved: The Murders of Tupac and the Notorious B.I.G.,"" a lightly fictionalized 10-part limited series on USA that has its premiere on Tuesday, is its certainty. Here is a show that offers answers, a ticktock of the various investigations into the killings that have resulted in no arrests but not, if ""Unsolved"" is to be believed, in no answers.

The series is inspired by ""Murder Rap: The Untold Story of the Biggie Smalls & Tupac Shakur Murder Investigations,"" a book by Greg Kading, who led a task force investigating the shootings in the late 2000s. (There is an accompanying documentary as well.) In that book, Mr. Kading lays out his theories about who pulled the triggers, and why. Yet somehow, seeing those theories brought to dramatized life -- seven episodes were provided for review -- gives them more power. ""Unsolved"" is equal parts appealingly pulpy and workmanlike, sometimes paced like a procedural and sometimes like a prestige drama. It weaves together three story lines -- the friendship between Tupac (Marcc Rose) and Biggie (Wavyy Jonez), which soured and ultimately collapsed; the original L.A.P.D. investigation into Biggie's murder, steered maniacally by the detective Russell Poole (Jimmi Simpson); and the task force convened a decade after the killings, helmed by Mr. Kading (Josh Duhamel). The love story here isn't between Biggie and Tupac, though ample screentime is given over to their early friendship. It's between the two detectives who never meet: Poole and Kading, who both begin to unravel in the face of a complex investigation, institutional pressure and family problems.

In this telling, Poole is the true detective, wholly and distractingly absorbed by the case. Mr. Simpson plays him as an impatient savant, forever sternly exhaling and chafing against his superiors. (It should be noted, though, that in the ""Murder Rap"" documentary, Mr. Kading makes short work of Mr. Poole's theories about the murders.) By contrast, Mr. Duhamel's Kading is blank. Better is his extended team, which includes Daryn Dupree (a grounded Bokeem Woodbine) and Lee Tucker (Wendell Pierce, testy as ever). Mr. Jonez captures the gentle grandeur of Biggie (born Christopher Wallace), and Mr. Rose has Tupac's familiar seductive glint in his eye. But this show about murdered rappers is really a cop show. What's more, ""Unsolved"" did not secure licensing rights for either rapper's music -- though some lyrics are sprinkled into conversation -- making them feel even more distant as subjects. In capturing the two investigations, though, ""Unsolved"" is effective in an unglamorous, no-frills way. And yet, as the episodes toggle between the ostentation of the hip-hop world and the grayness of police headquarters, it's hard to overlook that a story of this historical significance is rendered in such proletarian fashion. Add to that the fact that Mr. Kading's book and documentary were self-released, and that ""Unsolved"" isn't on a vanity platform like HBO or Netflix, or delivered with the luxe production values of the ""American Crime Story"" series, but rather on USA, a basic cable staple. You would think that a show that advertises a convincing theory about these killings would be lavished with funding, be loudly publicized not just as art, but also as news. But instead, ""Unsolved"" remains in the shadows.

Global Business,Indian Court Cancels Contentious Wireless Licenses,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/03/business/global/india-supreme-court-cancels-2g-licenses.html,"MUMBAI, India -- The Supreme Court of India issued a rebuke to the government Thursday by canceling 122 telecommunications licenses that were sold at below-market prices in 2008 amid a corruption scandal.

The action comes after several years of litigation in what has become known in India as the ""2G scam."" The controversy involved wireless phone licenses awarded at a price set in 2001 in a process that favored certain companies. It became the rallying cry for a large anticorruption movement that dominated public debate in the country last year. The scandal also implicated senior leaders for either supporting the tainted licensing or doing nothing to stop it.

One government auditor estimated in 2010 that the government had lost as much as 1.8 trillion rupees, or $35 billion at current exchange rates, by not using an auction to sell the licenses. Senior policy makers have struggled to explain their decisions on the licenses. At times, they have justified the sale at old prices by saying it was intended to help keep the costs of phone calls low. At other times they have blamed previous governments for setting the precedent of a fixed-price regime.

The minister overseeing telecommunications at the time of the sale, Andimuthu Raja, is in jail awaiting trial on charges of corruption. Several corporate executives and other government officials are also awaiting trial, though many of them are free on bail.

Art & Design,"For This Artist Duo, a Third Act: A Shrine to Oscar Wilde",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/06/arts/design/oscar-wilde-temple-artists.html,"Oscar Wilde's immense talent, inimitably foppish style and personal tribulations as a gay man make him a natural subject for the artistic duo known as McDermott & McGough. David McDermott and Peter McGough rose to art-world fame in the 1980s as boyfriends. They made subversive queer-themed paintings, and their photographs -- created in antique styles, with painstaking precision -- depicted them as dandies of a bygone era. That work won them several Whitney Biennial appearances and financial success. But it all fell apart in the 1990s -- they split up as a couple and lost their homes in a tax-related debacle. Mr. McGough nearly died of complications from AIDS. Mr. McDermott renounced his United States citizenship and exiled himself to Ireland, where he remains, facing health issues of his own.

The temple, which takes over the Russell Chapel at the Church of the Village on 13th Street from Sept. 11 to Dec. 2, will be an Aesthetic Movement-style shrine with paintings, sculptures and rows of chairs for worshipers amid faux-painted columns meant to resemble crumbling stone. It will be available for weddings and other ceremonies, with proceeds going to the youth and family programs at the church's neighbor across the street, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center. The center collaborated on the project with the Church of the Village, and it was organized by the independent curator Alison Gingeras. In his Bushwick studio last month, Mr. McGough, 59, excitedly showed off the temple components. ""I always loved Oscar Wilde because he was a complete fop,"" he said. ""He's the deity of the religion."" Mr. McGough -- robustly healthy these days and dressed in a natty cream-colored suit on a humid afternoon -- was surrounded by eight gold-and-blue ""Reading Gaol"" paintings, named for the prison where Wilde did hard labor after being convicted of sodomy and ""gross indecency."" They depict Wilde undergoing the Stations of the Cross, complete with gilded halo, in the style of a Victorian police gazette. In front of Mr. McGough was a smooth, four-foot-tall wooden sculpture of Wilde, the show's centerpiece.

The two artists have been talking about such a project for more than 20 years. ""The idea has evolved and changed,"" Mr. McDermott, 65, wrote in an email from Dublin. He added that for him, summoning Wilde represented a return to ""civilization"" after a 100-year decline. Despite their ups and downs, the former couple still collaborate, and have shuttled back and forth among Ireland, England (where they are setting up a studio) and New York, where they are represented by the Chelsea gallery Cheim & Read. Though Mr. McGough was the more hands-on partner for the temple -- Mr. McDermott has had trouble getting permission to reenter the United States, and he was not going to attend the temple opening -- they consider it a McDermott & McGough just like their previous works. They found a savvy advocate for the project in Ms. Gingeras, who has held positions at the Guggenheim Museum and Francois Pinault's Palazzo Grassi in Venice.

Mr. McGough met Ms. Gingeras at a party, and soon after they were off and running, with an assist from the movie producer Dorothy Berwin, a supporter of the community center and one of the underwriters of the project. The ""Oscar Wilde Temple"" will travel to London's Studio Voltaire in the fall of 2018. Ms. Gingeras also curated a retrospective show of their work, ""McDermott & McGough: I've Seen the Future and I'm Not Going,"" on view at Dallas Contemporary from Sept. 29 to Dec. 17. Though the Church of the Village has never attempted an art show on this scale, the lead pastor there, the Rev. Jeff Wells, said the temple was a natural fit because of the church's significant L.G.B.T. membership. ""We thought it was a terrific idea to honor Oscar Wilde and other martyrs of the liberation movement,"" Mr. Wells said. ""Plus, it's not bad publicity for the church.""

Health,A.I. Comes to the Operating Room,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/06/health/artificial-intelligence-brain-cancer.html,"Brain surgeons are bringing artificial intelligence and new imaging techniques into the operating room, to diagnose tumors as accurately as pathologists, and much faster, according to a report in the journal Nature Medicine. The new approach streamlines the standard practice of analyzing tissue samples while the patient is still on the operating table, to help guide brain surgery and later treatment. The traditional method, which requires sending the tissue to a lab, freezing and staining it, then peering at it through a microscope, takes 20 to 30 minutes or longer. The new technique takes two and a half minutes. Like the old method, it requires that tissue be removed from the brain, but uses lasers to create images and a computer to read them in the operating room. ""Although we often have clues based on preoperative M.R.I., establishing diagnosis is a primary goal of almost all brain tumor operations, whether we're removing a tumor or just taking a biopsy,"" said Dr. Daniel A. Orringer, a neurosurgeon at N.Y.U. Langone Health and the senior author of the report.

In addition to speeding up the process, the new technique can also detect some details that traditional methods may miss, like the spread of a tumor along nerve fibers, he said. And unlike the usual method, the new one does not destroy the sample, so the tissue can be used again for further testing. The new process may also help in other procedures where doctors need to analyze tissue while they are still operating, such as head and neck, breast, skin and gynecologic surgery, the report said. It also noted that there is a shortage of neuropathologists, and suggested that the new technology might help fill the gap in medical centers that lack the specialty.

Algorithms are also being developed to help detect lung cancers on CT scans, diagnose eye disease in people with diabetes and find cancer on microscope slides. The new report brings artificial intelligence -- so-called deep neural networks -- a step closer to patients and their treatment. The study involved brain tissue from 278 patients, analyzed while the surgery was still going on. Each sample was split, with half going to A.I. and half to a neuropathologist. The diagnoses were later judged right or wrong based on whether they agreed with the findings of lengthier and more extensive tests performed after the surgery.

The study was paid for by the National Cancer Institute, the University of Michigan and private foundations. Dr. Orringer owns stock in the company that made the imaging system, as do several co-authors, who are company employees. He conducted the research at the University of Michigan, before moving to New York. ""Having an accurate intra-operative diagnosis is going to be very useful,"" said Dr. Joshua Bederson, the chairman of neurosurgery for the Mount Sinai Health System, who was not involved in the study. He added, ""I think they understated the significance of this."" He said the traditional method of examining tissue during brain surgery, called a frozen section, often took much longer than 30 minutes, and was often far less accurate than it was in the study. At some centers, he said, brain surgeons do not even order frozen sections because they do not trust them and prefer to wait for tissue processing after the surgery, which may take weeks to complete. ""The neuropathologists I work with are outstanding,"" Dr. Bederson said. ""They hate frozen sections. They don't want us to make life-altering decisions based on something that's not so reliable."" Dr. Bederson said that the study authors had set a very high bar for their new technique by pitting it against experts at three medical centers renowned for excellence in neurosurgery and neuropathology: Columbia University in New York, the University of Miami and the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. ""I think that what happened with this study is that because they wanted to do a good comparison, they had the best of the best of the traditional method, which I think far exceeds what's available in most cases,"" Dr. Bederson said. The key to the study was the use of lasers to scan tissue samples with certain wavelengths of light, a technique called stimulated Raman histology. Different types of tissue scatter the light in distinctive ways. The light hits a detector, which emits a signal that a computer can process to reconstruct the image and identify the tissue.

The system also generates virtual images similar to traditional slides that humans can examine. The researchers used images from tissue from 415 brain surgery patients to train an artificial intelligence system to identify the 10 most common types of brain tumor. Some types of brain tumor are so rare that there is not enough data on them to train an A.I. system, so the system in the study was designed to essentially toss out samples it could not identify. Over all, the system did make mistakes: It misdiagnosed 14 cases that the humans got right. And the doctors missed 17 cases that the computer got right. ""I couldn't have hoped for a better result,"" Dr. Orringer said. ""It's exciting. It says the combination of an algorithm plus human intuition improves our ability to predict diagnosis."" In his own practice, Dr. Orringer said that he often used the system to determine quickly whether he had removed as much of a brain tumor as possible, or should keep cutting. ""If I have six questions during an operation, I can get them answered without having six times 30 or 40 minutes,"" he said. ""I didn't do this before. It's a lot of burden to the patient to be under anesthesia for that long."" Dr. Bederson said that he had participated in a pilot study of a system similar to the one in the study and wanted to use it, and that his hospital was considering acquiring the technology.",Images made by lasers and read by computers can help speed up the diagnosis of brain tumors during surgery.,18388277-4c3f-55a6-a4d4-40adcc434069,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/06/science/06AI-BRAIN-still/06AI-BRAIN-still-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7c38124dae82250d2e3c8983683ae794366c363d46e48482dcd32a8ecefbdbdb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Using laser imaging and artificial intelligence, researchers were able to diagnose brain tumors in under 150 seconds.

Sports,Two Women Who Stuck With It Win Aussie Doubles Crown,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/25/sports/tennis/sam-stosur-australian-open.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia -- There's no rewinding the results in sports, as New Orleans fans still fuming about last week's N.F.C. Championship game can attest. But sometimes, as Sam Stosur proved Friday at the Australian Open, it is possible to get it right the second time. In 2006, Stosur, a Queenslander playing in the women's doubles final in her home Grand Slam, lost her service while attempting to close out the match in the second set. Stosur and her doubles partner, Lisa Raymond, squandered two championship points on their way to a three-set defeat to the Chinese team of Yan Zi and Zheng Jie. Thirteen years later, Stosur was back in the women's doubles final, this time alongside China's Zhang Shuai. They were playing the defending champions, Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, and again Stosur was serving in the second set to close out the match. Stosur earned a championship point, which she squandered with a double fault. But the past doesn't have to be prologue. On the next point, Stosur produced an overhead winner to end a 25-shot rally. Then she watched the 13th shot of the next point sail long, near her feet, to seal her 6-3, 6-4 victory with Zhang at Rod Laver Arena.

It was sweet redemption for Stosur, not only because of her near miss in 2006 but also because of all her quick exits here in the singles competition. Since defeating Serena Williams in the final to win the 2011 United States Open, Stosur, 34, has exited in the first round in singles in this tournament five times, including the past four years. Stosur held her head high after her latest opening-round defeat, last week in straight sets to Dayana Yastremska, an 18-year-old from Ukraine, of whom she said, ""I think she's going to be a very good player."" Stosur, who won the mixed doubles here in 2005 with Scott Draper, immediately turned her attention to the women's doubles. ""I think probably for any singles player, playing doubles can almost feel more relaxing or more fun,"" she said. In Zhang, Stosur found a partner whose wit is as sharp as her net play. She kept Stosur loose -- and occasionally made her laugh out loud -- with her on-court comments. ""If we could transfer that a little bit into the singles court, that would be a good thing,"" Stosur said. Zhang, 30, had exited in the first round in singles in all 14 majors she had played and was contemplating retirement in early 2016 when Stosur sent her a long and passionate text encouraging her to continue playing. Zhang then advanced to the quarterfinals in singles at the 2016 Australian Open as a qualifier -- still her best finish in singles in a major -- and now, on the strength of Stosur's powers of persuasion, she can call herself a Grand Slam champion.

These two weeks, Zhang added, have been the most ""amazing in my life."" Stosur said she had been in communication with Raymond, who told her the other night in a text: ""Go get it 13 years later. Get it now."" Stosur said, ""That was really nice."" The stands were roughly half full for the final but wholly behind Stosur and Zhang, ringing the stadium with chants of ""Aussie, Aussie, Aussie, Oy, Oy, Oy."" ""You guys definitely are in a good mood right now,"" Mladenovic said to the crowd during the on-court trophy presentation. ""That was not our goal."" The walk from the court to the locker room took Stosur and Zhang nearly as long as Stosur's opening service game, which lasted 10 minutes, because every few steps she was stopped by well-wishers. Tournament workers applauded when Stosur emerged from a media-center elevator, and she received more applause from reporters as soon as she stepped inside the main interview room. ""I think to be able to play at home is super exciting,"" Stosur said. ""I can feel my phone going off every two seconds at the moment. It's great to know that the support's there from everyone that's close to you, but also feeling it from people you don't even know who are happy and excited, it's an amazing feeling.""","Sam Stosur made up for a loss in the doubles final 13 years ago. Her partner, Zhang Shuai, nearly quit the sport in 2016.

Global Business,World Bank Is Opening Its Treasure Chest of Data,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/03/business/global/03world.html,"THE Piper PA-31 Navajo took off into the sultry Miami morning and streaked southward toward the Caribbean. High over Haiti, the cameras inside began to snap. Behind this reconnaissance mission was, of all things, a financial institution: the World Bank, symbol of globalization and, to many, the hubris of wealthy nations. But this was hardly some clandestine operation. On the contrary, the aerial photographs taken that January morning in 2010, shortly after a powerful earthquake leveled much of Port-au-Prince, were soon uploaded to the Web for all to see, along with an invitation to help World Bank specialists assess the damage and figure out how to aid Haiti. The appeal marked a radical departure for the often close-to-the-vest World Bank, which, like its brother, the International Monetary Fund, has been called everything from arrogant to inept. The World Bank, you see, wants the world to know that it is finally opening up, albeit slowly and, at times, a bit painfully.

The I.M.F. has grabbed the hot headlines lately, having become a tabloid fixture after its leader, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, was accused of sexually assaulting a housekeeper in a Midtown Manhattan hotel. That allegation began unraveling on Friday, when prosecutors themselves questioned the victim's credibility. Not that Mr. Strauss-Kahn is going back to his old job; last week, the fund named Christine Lagarde, the French finance minister, as its next leader. But while the I.M.F. is busy with scandal and the debt crisis now shaking Europe, officials at the World Bank's headquarters here are confronting some existential questions, including the big one: What exactly are we doing here? The World Bank's traditional role has been to finance specific projects that foster economic development, whereas the I.M.F.'s goal is to safeguard the global monetary system. But many people, particularly in the developing world, have long questioned whether the economic prescriptions that these two lofty institutions hand down from Washington -- essentially: liberalize, privatize and deregulate -- have done anything but advance the interests of wealthy nations like the United States. That the I.M.F. is now championing deeply unpopular austerity measures for Greece, where street protests continued last week, only sharpens that point. So it might come as a surprise that the president of the World Bank, Robert B. Zoellick, a career diplomat and member of the Republican foreign-policy elite, argues that the most valuable currency of the World Bank isn't its money -- it is its information. Created in 1944 and, by custom, headed by an American, the World Bank initially helped finance the reconstruction of war-torn Europe. Since then, it has extended many trillions in loans for a wide variety of projects, be they institutions like schools and hospitals, infrastructure like roads or, controversially, environmentally unfriendly projects like coal-fired power plants and hydroelectric dams. Along the way the World Bank, like the I.M.F., has tinkered with entire economies, sometimes with disastrous results.

Yet the Haiti flights -- which cost about the same as a World Bank report -- were the harbinger of a quiet revolution now gripping this aloof institution. More than 600 engineers in 21 countries analyzed the data collected over Haiti, and their conclusions -- essentially what to rebuild and where -- have since been used by the Haitian government, relief organizations, companies and myriad others. ""It was like the cowboy West in terms of the boundaries of the project and what we were able to do,"" says Stuart P. D. Gill, a computational cosmologist and project coordinator for the bank's disaster reduction and recovery labs. Long regarded as a windowless ivory tower, the World Bank is opening its vast vault of information. True, the bank still lends roughly $57 billion in the fiscal year ended June 30. But it is increasingly competing for influence and power with Wall Street, national governments and smaller regional development banks, who have as much or more money to offer. It is no longer the only game in town. And so Mr. Zoellick, 57, is wielding knowledge -- lots of it. For more than a year, the bank has been releasing its prized data sets, currently giving public access to more than 7,000 that were previously available only to some 140,000 subscribers -- mostly governments and researchers, who pay to gain access to it. Those data sets contain all sorts of information about the developing world, whether workaday economic statistics -- gross domestic product, consumer price inflation and the like -- or arcana like how many women are breast-feeding their children in rural Peru. It is a trove unlike anything else in the world, and, it turns out, highly valuable. For whatever its accuracy or biases, this data essentially defines the economic reality of billions of people and is used in making policies and decisions that have an enormous impact on their lives.

Joking aside, Mr. Zoellick speaks with an ambassadorial gravitas -- not surprising, given that he spent most of his career as a United States diplomat. Mr. Zoellick came to the job in July 2007, replacing Paul D. Wolfowitz, who resigned after a long string of controversies then ended in a scandal about his relationship with an employee.
* Today in On Tech: Imagine not living in Big Tech's world.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. A lawyer by training, Mr. Zoellick has made the rounds in Washington, particularly in Republican circles. In the 1980s, at the Treasury Department and the White House, he advised President George H. W. Bush. In the 1990s, he worked at the mortgage giant Fannie Mae, today a potent symbol of all that went wrong in the mortgage business. Later, as the United States trade representative for President George W. Bush, he was a vocal advocate of free trade. Later still, at the State Department, under Condoleezza Rice, he advocated the war with Iraq and was viewed as an architect of the administration's China policy. He then cooled his heels briefly as a managing director at Goldman Sachs. Now, he is essentially telling the World Bank's 10,000 employees that he no longer considers their institution to be at the center of the development universe. ""As opposed to some imperious bureaucracy in Washington, we're making things open and accessible to people,"" he says. ""That makes for better performance, it makes for a more open system, it makes for people having a different attitude about the World Bank."" To some World Bank insiders, this amounts to a declaration of war on their decades-old culture, a war that began when Mr. Zoellick arrived and instituted a daily 8:30 a.m. meeting of senior executives -- ""a shock to some of the people involved,"" he recalls.

""It's not been bloody, but it's not been easy, either,"" says Sanjay Pradhan, vice president of the World Bank Institute, a unit that advises and counsels governments, and that Mr. Zoellick has designated as his strike force in the fight for greater transparency. He is not the first World Bank leader to struggle to match its practices to its principles. The bank, after all, has had an open-information policy for four decades. James D. Wolfensohn, who ran the bank from 1995 to 2005 and was beloved by employees, even called it the ""Knowledge Bank,"" and during his tenure, it spent $280 million to improve the way it shares information with its staff, client governments and organizations. But by its own account, the World Bank failed to embed that concept of openness in its own culture, despite significant improvements in technology and tools for sharing information. ""Senior management can announce grand strategies and reorganizations, but it must rely on middle management at the bank to execute them,"" says David Ian Shaman, a former World Bank official. ""Middle management is composed of fiefdoms that are preserved by maintaining the status quo and so has little incentive to implement change."" In a book titled ""The World Bank Unveiled: Inside the Revolutionary Struggle for Transparency,"" Mr. Shaman chronicled his battle during the Wolfensohn era to webcast things like internal policy debates. Bank insiders worried that his Web service, called B-SPAN, would open the bank to criticism and reduce its authority. ""The cultural norm of the bank is to hoard information, and when it does release information, it is either perfect or choreographed for delivery to a specific audience,"" Mr. Shaman says. In 2004, for instance, B-SPAN was initially barred from taping a speech given by a development economist, Hernando de Soto, at an event to inaugurate a new policy on information access.

DAVID ROODMAN, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, has had his own struggles with the World Bank. But as a researcher, he says he understands reluctance among World Bank officials to throw open the doors. The bank's researchers work hard to collect data. If it appears online, they may lose a chance to mine it for their own research papers, and thus lose money and prestige. ""It's the capital basis of your world -- and if you share what you've done and people find mistakes, what's in it for you?"" Mr. Roodman says. People outside the World Bank are eager for its information. Its newly released data -- from economic stats to numbers on landmines -- has attracted more than 4.5 million unique views. Indeed, more people come to its Web site looking for data than anything else. ""I'm astonished by the number of people apparently just waiting for our data to become free,"" says Shaida Badiee, director of the bank's economic development data group. ""I had no idea how big a deal this was going to be."" Mr. Zoellick says that he understands his employees' worries but that opening analysis and research to public scrutiny will lead to fewer mistakes. ""There will be, I'm sure over a series of years, bad stories that come out as a result of this, and if you're part of the bad stories, it's probably not going to be something you're going to like,"" he says. ""But my view is that it is far better for the institution and its health to be open.""

Having created models for open-sourcing and crowd-sourcing, the bank is now moving toward mash-ups. A new Mapping for Results program offers interactive maps pinpointing locations of almost 3,000 bank projects in more than 16,000 places worldwide. Links open up pages with information about each project, and users can add overlays that show, say, where infant mortality is highest to see whether the bank's work in those areas matches the need. The program is sensitive because it involves releasing data provided by client governments and others, but the hope is that it will prompt these parties to link their own data on economic and social development to the site or otherwise make it available. THE Swedish government, a big public supporter of development projects, has followed suit with a prototype, a Web site with information about where it spends its aid money and the impact its spending has had. ""The goal is to achieve as effective poverty reduction as possible,"" the Swedish government said this year in announcing the effort. ""To achieve this goal, development cooperation must be opened up to transparency and ideas from others."" Next week, Kenya, too, will open a Web site giving access to data that, until now, has existed largely in books on the shelves of various ministries. Software developers are already playing with it -- seeking patterns like whether there is any correlation between the government's spending on schools and students' test scores, literacy and matriculation. ""The World Bank has made it easier with what it is doing with open data,"" says Bitange Ndemo, Kenya's permanent secretary for information. The broader release of such data will enable more ""scientific"" policy-making, cut down on corruption in Kenya and engage more people in government by empowering them with knowledge they can use to challenge political leaders, he says. Asked if there would be resistance to public dissemination of government data, Dr. Ndemo said transparency was inevitable. Information is valuable, he says, and people will find a way to get it: ""This is one of those things, like mobile phones and the Internet, that you cannot control.""","Robert B.

Sports,More Games Postponed With 4 More Coronavirus Cases for Cardinals,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/01/sports/baseball/coronavirus-cardinals.html,"Major League Baseball's sputtering effort to play in a pandemic took another discouraging turn on Saturday when one St. Louis Cardinals player and three team staffers tested positive for the coronavirus, forcing the postponement of their weekend series in Milwaukee.

After deciding earlier Saturday to postpone the game for that night, M.L.B. announced several hours later that it had called off the Sunday doubleheader, meaning that the teams will not play any games in their series unless they can be made up elsewhere during the densely scheduled 60-game season. The Cardinals' Monday game in Detroit was also postponed, but the league said it would be made up as part of a doubleheader later in the week.

The Cardinals, who also had two players receive positive tests on Friday, now have six positives in their traveling party and have become the second team, with the Miami Marlins, to experience an outbreak less than two weeks into the truncated M.L.B. season. The Marlins have had 20 people, including 18 players, test positive since last Sunday.

With the Cardinals-Brewers postponements, six teams -- comprising 20 percent of the league -- have been shut down this weekend for reasons related to the virus. The Marlins and the Phillies have not played since last Sunday, when the Marlins learned of their outbreak before a game in Philadelphia.

On Wednesday, Sanders finally capitulated to political reality and withdrew from the race.

The fact is that a decisive majority -- 60 percent -- of the Democratic electorate is made up of men and women loyal to the centrist party establishment, such as it is, and to organizations, from unions to party committees, that are aligned with it.

Earlier this month, Shom Mazumder, a political scientist at Harvard, published a study, ""Why The Progressive Left Fits So Uncomfortably Within The Democratic Party,"" that analyzed data from a 2019 survey of 2,900 likely Democratic primary voters. ""I saw two clear poles emerge within the Democratic Party,"" he writes: The ""establishment"" and the ""progressive left."" A third group also emerged, and while it's not as clearly defined as the other two, it has some overlap with the establishment and tends to be more fond of Wall Street, so I'm calling that ""neoliberals."" ""Establishment"" voters, in this scheme, means center-left voters who make up just over 60 percent of the total. They stood out as favorably inclined to Nancy Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, Barack Obama and the Democratic National Committee -- in other words, to the Democratic establishment. ""Progressive left"" Democrats, at just under 20 percent, were most favorable to labor unions, Black Lives Matter, the #MeToo movement, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Democratic Socialists of America. These Democrats viewed business interests -- as exemplified by Wall Street -- negatively, and they weren't happy about Joe Manchin, the centrist senator from West Virginia, either. The third group, ""neoliberal"" Democrats, at 20 percent, is as large as the progressive wing. These voters like what the progressives don't like -- Wall Street, Manchin -- and dislike pretty much everything progressives favor, including Ocasio-Cortez and the Democratic Socialists of America. Mazumder uses the label ""establishment Democrats"" idiosyncratically. His data shows that at 44 percent, minorities make up a much larger share of these voters than their share of either progressives, at 28 percent, or neoliberals at 32 percent. His establishment voters are roughly 60-40 female, while the other two categories are majority male. In contrast, Mazumder's progressives stand out as the whitest group -- 72 percent Anglo -- of the three categories, the least diverse constituency of an increasingly multicultural and multiracial party.

Gilens, Page and their critics basically agree on the same set of facts. Their differences emerge from their conflicting interpretations of those facts. Take the enactment of Obamacare. For Gilens, the final legislation reflects the failure of the Democratic Party to achieve progressive goals: In 2009, with unified Democratic Party control and a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate, the Democratic Party failed even to include a public option in Obamacare, much less establish a health insurance program that would cover all uninsured Americans. The Affordable Care Act, Gilens continued, is ""one illustration of the power of interest groups in constraining Democratic Party policy."" Critics of Gilens' argument contend that enactment of Obamacare marks the first major downwardly redistributive federal legislation in generations, a major progressive achievement after decades of conservative success in distributing income and wealth to those in the top brackets. ""The A.C.A. was less sweeping than it could have been because of the constraints imposed by a powerful health care lobby, but it was more sweeping than anything that had come before,"" Rhodes wrote by email. ""The fact that significant health care legislation was enacted in spite of substantial resistance was a testament to the strength of progressive mobilization at the time."" In other words, for Gilens, the glass is half empty, for Rhodes, half full. The view associated with Bernie Sanders and some scholars, which suggests that both parties have been bought off by rich donors to represent the rich and big business at the expense of the middle class, is inconsistent with the patterns we observe. The Republican Party, they contend, perhaps unnecessarily, does seem consistently responsive to business preferences and its positions are more often associated with those of the affluent. On economic policy in particular, Republican leaders much better represent affluent and business preferences. But the Democratic Party, Grossmann and Isaac argue, ""is not aligned with business preferences or affluent preferences in any domain -- and actually represents middle-class views over affluent views on economic policy."" Along similar lines, Rhodes and Schaffner found in their 2017 paper that: Individuals with Democratic congressional representatives experience a fundamentally different type of representation than do individuals with Republican representatives. Individuals with Democratic representatives encounter a mode of representation best described as ""populist."" individuals with Republican representatives experience an ""oligarchic"" mode of representation, in which wealthy individuals receive much more representation than those lower on the economic ladder. In an email, Rhodes noted that Democrats are on average more responsive to their less affluent constituents than they are to their more affluent constituents, while for Republicans the reverse is true. If the standard in judging the Democratic Party is whether it would support a radical upheaval vastly expanding the federal government, Rhodes continued, then it's fair to say that few elected Democrats at the national level are contemplating major departures from prevailing economic and political arrangements. There's little evidence that most elected Democrats want an economic ""revolution."" But, Rhodes continued, ""the reality is more complicated"" than the Sanders claim that ""the party is dominated by corporate interests and is unresponsive to the demands of the working and middle classes."" Instead, according to Rhodes, there's a decent case to be made that many Democratic elected officials are indeed representing their working- and middle-class constituents by taking moderately liberal positions on most economic issues. Interestingly, the progressive wing of the Democratic Party faces another challenge from an unexpected source.

Eitan Hersh, who is also a political scientist at Tufts, suggests in his new book, ""Politics Is for Power,"" that the Democratic left is threatened by a political side effect of the internet. The web, he writes, has facilitated the growth -- concentrated especially in the ranks of well-educated white progressives -- of voters seeking ""a shortcut to feeling engaged without being engaged,"" voters for whom ""emotion -- righteous anger -- is an end rather than a means to an end."" Hersh calls these voters ""hobbyists."" They spend an hour a day or more closely following politics primarily on social media, but they rarely, if ever, actually engage in politics through volunteering or other grass roots activity. Hersh provided data comparing the demographics of hobbyists to non-hobbyists. First and foremost, hobbyists are white, 82 percent, compared with 67 percent for non-hobbyists. They are majority male, 53 percent, compared with non-hobbyists who are 59 percent female. They are better educated, 37 percent with college degrees, compared with 30 percent among non-hobbyists. In a further refinement of his analysis, Hersh compared voters who spend an hour or more a day on politics and do no volunteer work with those who spend an hour a day but also perform volunteer work -- in other words, those who not only follow politics closely but also engage in grass roots activities. There were some striking differences, Hersh wrote by email: The people who spend an hour or more a day on politics but no time in volunteerism are 82 percent white, but those who do volunteering are only 60 percent white. The political hobbyists are 47 percent women but the volunteers are 64 percent women. I asked Hersh why certain Democrats and liberals were drawn to hobbyism. One factor, according to Hersh, is that many hobbyists are not facing hard times: College educated whites do politics as a leisure activity because the status quo is pretty good for them, and they are not motivated either by fears or by a sense of linked fate to those who do have pressing needs to get off their couches. They might say they hate Trump, are worried about polarization, are afraid of climate change, etc., but they aren't really interested in doing anything about it because they don't find the direction of the country sufficiently threatening to them. If political hobbyists go ahead and vote, why worry about what they do or don't do? Political hobbyism isn't just a distinct activity from the pursuit of political power; it hinders the pursuit of political power. Since politics, including the politics of governing, is a competition in the exercise of power and influence, corporations and rich people are going to press for their interests no matter what. Insofar as progressive forces include a disproportionate share of hobbyists -- as they currently do -- progressives are going to be weakened in that struggle for power. Interests will always conflict, and the conflicts are often as intense and bitter within a political party as they are between political parties. But political coalitions like the Democratic Party depend on the willingness of competitive forces to come to a compromise or at least a working agreement.

Unfortunately, intraparty dissension often brings the whole house down. Strategically, the challenge for progressives in the wake of Sanders's departure from the race is not to defeat the Democratic Party, nor is it to generate a constant drumbeat of hostility from the left. The challenge is to combine forces with the rest of the party and deploy that power to win elections and change lives. This column has been updated to reflect news developments.

Music,Review: Roscoe Mitchell Jackhammers a New Musical Funhouse,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/arts/music/review-roscoe-mitchell-park-avenue-armory.html,"On Wednesday at the Park Avenue Armory, toward the end of a solo on sopranino saxophone that had lasted more than 10 minutes, Roscoe Mitchell made it seem as though the intimate dimensions of the Armory's Veterans Room were in the process of being jackhammered. After the solo's gradual introductory section -- full of rough-textured honks and droning harmonics -- Mr. Mitchell started dispensing a stream of lightning-quick traditional notes, each one full of robust authority. And then, thanks to some gales of circular breathing, he managed to thread one of those earlier, overblown harmonics atop the ongoing, bebop-influenced flurry. This time the droning pitch was pealing, and ecstatically clear. The room shook with the swelling overtones of amplified, electroacoustic music. But Mr. Mitchell's funhouse was a fully acoustic one. Then, switching back to his rougher extended-technique pitches, he once again sneaked in that liquid legato line of traditional notes, this time in a raspier style. The cumulative impact of this solo tour de force involved two different ways of looking at his polyphonic capability.

The piece, ""Sustain and Run,"" was the highlight of Mr. Mitchell's presence as an instrumentalist on Wednesday. But it wasn't the apex of the two concerts of his music that were presented at the Armory as part of the Artists Studio series organized by the pianist and composer Jason Moran. In the evening's first set, Joseph Kubera brought intensity and warmth to the toccata-style central movement of Mr. Mitchell's piano piece ""8/8/88."" In the second concert, a collection of players drawn from the Wavefield Ensemble showed off a lovely group blend when navigating the sympathetically swirling melodic motifs in ""Cutouts for Woodwind Quintet."" Mr. Mitchell was heard in a larger chamber ensemble that closed the second concert, as well as in the Trio Space, a new version of a past group with the baritone Thomas Buckner. (The band now also includes the multi-instrumentalist Scott Robinson.) It was possible throughout these performances to hear the wide vistas of near-silent poise, in between peaks of intensity, that characterized Mr. Mitchell's more widely heard work with the Art Ensemble of Chicago, the pathbreaking group he co-founded 50 years ago. This year Mr. Mitchell and another longtime Art Ensemble member, Famoudou Don Moye, will lead a new lineup of the group at the Big Ears Festival in Knoxville, Tenn., and will release a double album on Pi Recordings. Later this month, Mr. Mitchell will also release a new set of his orchestral music, on the Wide Hive label. Aspects of that record -- ""Littlefield Concert Hall Mills College"" -- were similarly reflected in the sets Mr. Mitchell presented on Wednesday. On the recording and at the Armory, it's clear that Mr. Mitchell's presence as a soloist is not required for performances of his music to sound idiomatic, and that his past work is continuously open to radical revision.

At the second show on Wednesday, his stridently strutting 1970s ""Nonaah"" was played in a more lyrical later arrangement for piano, oboe and flute. And on the ""Littlefield"" recording, a 25-piece orchestra plays newer versions of pieces that the Wide Hive label has already released, like ""Frenzy House."" The journey of ""Frenzy House"" to its current state also works as a useful summary of Mr. Mitchell's versatility. The piece began as a riotous improvisation by Mr. Mitchell, the pianist Craig Taborn and the percussionist Kikanju Baku. But after that improvisation was transcribed and rearranged for its first orchestral recording, its composer was not yet finished exploring it.

In its latest version, there is some fresh opening thematic material that adds a surprising, if characteristically tart, quality of Americana. Unlike on prior recordings of ""Frenzy House,"" Mr. Mitchell doesn't play on this new recording -- but in all its unpredictable mergers of style, it sounds completely of a piece with his back catalog. ""The thing I like about this process,"" Mr. Mitchell said in an email this week, ""is that it's ongoing.""",The veteran composer and instrumentalist was featured in two concerts of his work at the Park Avenue Armory on Wednesday.,2b34e6fa-24a3-55e4-a934-abf2e5c32ff2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/07/arts/07roscoe/07roscoe-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=d09d9196130d9d7a825aa0a2c524c22224201608a068c373bc942840bc127d9e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Roscoe Mitchell playing a solo during a concert devoted to his music on Wednesday at the Park Avenue Armory.,2b34e6fa-24a3-55e4-a934-abf2e5c32ff2,N24News/imgs/2b34e6fa-24a3-55e4-a934-abf2e5c32ff2.jpg,12
Movies,"Bruce Baillie, 'Essential' Avant-Garde Filmmaker, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/movies/bruce-baillie-essential-avant-garde-filmmaker-dies-at-88.html,"Bruce Baillie, who personified the Bay Area experimental cinema of the 1960s as an independent filmmaker and consummate 16-millimeter craftsman whose most extraordinary movie is a single panning shot, died on Friday at his home on Camano Island, Wash. He was 88. A catalytic figure in the development of West Coast avant-garde film, Mr. Baillie became known in the mid-1960s for his lyrical landscape films -- one of which, ""Castro Street"" (1966), was selected for the National Film Registry in 1992 -- as well as for his anguished considerations of the landscape's despoliation in films like ""Mass"" (1964) and ""Quixote"" (1965). Six of his movies, including those three, are regularly screened by Anthology Film Archives in New York as part of the institution's ""essential cinema."" Filmmakers as varied as George Lucas and the Thai director Apichatpong Weerasethakul have cited Mr. Baillie's work as an inspiration.

""Quixote,"" a densely edited collage, was made while Mr. Baillie was living out of a Volkswagen bug, traveling from west to east during the same summer that Ken Kesey's Merry Pranksters made a similar, if more drug-addled, journey, as recounted by Tom Wolfe in ""The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test"" (1968). Mr. Baillie's fellow avant-gardist filmmaker Jonas Mekas, who died last year, described ""Quixote"" in The Village Voice as ""visionary."" Mr. Baillie was an apostle of meditation, not LSD. ""Quixote"" was edited while he was living in a shed at the Morning Star Ranch, a commune in Sonoma County, Calif., that Time magazine described as ""perhaps the most hopeful development in the hippie philosophy to date."" ""I want to discover true American themes, the images that lay closest to the hearts of our citizens,"" Mr. Baillie told a reporter in 1962. But he also looked across the Pacific for inspiration. (""Bruce Baillie lives his Zen,"" the poet and fellow West Coast filmmaker James Broughton once wrote.) The critic P. Adams Sitney, who wrote of Mr. Baillie at length in his study of American avant-garde cinema, ""Visionary Film"" (1974), noted that ""the oriental 'saint' in a fusion of Zen, Tao and Confucian traditions is the first of the heroes proposed by Baillie's cinema."" ""Quick Billy,"" which Mr. Baillie made after a near-fatal bout of hepatitis, was a mock western based in part on ""The Tibetan Book of the Dead.""

""The effect of Baillie's films is to make the viewer feel that any moment of the viewing, any single image he is looking at, is a mere illusion that will soon vanish,"" the critic Fred Camper wrote in ""International Dictionary of Film and Filmmakers."" ""The sensuousness of the light and colors only heighten one's awareness of their unreality,"" he added. ""It is as if there is a void, a nothingness, that lies behind all things.""

Mr. Baillie was born on Sept. 24, 1931, in Aberdeen, S.D., to Gladys and E. Kenneth Baillie. His father, a sculptor, taught art at Northern State Teachers College (now Northern State College). Mr. Baillie graduated from high school in 1949 and, after serving in the Navy during the Korean War, studied art at the University of Minnesota and the University of California at Berkeley. He went on to study filmmaking at the London School of Film Technique. On his return to California in 1960, Mr. Baillie began making short films while supporting himself as a longshoreman and living in Canyon, an unincorporated town in the Berkeley Hills. There he helped start the Canyon Cinema Co-op, a distribution center for avant-garde films that was born when Mr. Baillie began showing films, including his own, for friends and neighbors on a sheet hung between two trees in his backyard. The screenings, which offered free wine and popcorn, soon moved to Berkeley. ""We'd show a cartoon, a newsreel, then slip in some experimental films,"" Mr. Baillie's partner in the cooperative, the filmmaker Chick Strand, recalled. The audience, which included the critic Pauline Kael among other local movie enthusiasts, was ""all friends, artists, academics, crazies,"" Ms. Strand wrote.

""It was a party,"" she added, ""but very quiet, very joyful."" Children and pets were welcome. ""It was not just a showing; it was also a little tribal assemblage,"" according to the novelist Ernest Callenbach, a Canyon regular who founded and edited the journal Film Quarterly and who also hosted screenings in his backyard. By 1963, the Canyon Cinema shows were being held across the bay in the North beach area of San Francisco, where attendees included the young George Lucas. (Decades later, one of Mr. Lucas's charitable foundations would help fund the digital transfer of Mr. Baillie's films.) The North Beach screenings were the basis for what would become the San Francisco Cinematheque. Mr. Baillie had helped found a Canyon Cinema newsletter to further publicize the work that Canyon distributed. He later taught filmmaking at Rice University in Houston, Bard College in New York State and Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash. His last years were spent on Camano Island in a house that had belonged to his parents, with whom he remained close. ""All the films and my life are thanks to my mother, Gladys, and my father, E. Kenneth Baillie,"" Mr. Baillie told an interviewer in 1989. Mr. Baillie married Lorie Apit, a native of the Philippines, in 1986. In addition to her, he is survived by their two children, Wind Gwladys Baillie and Keith Kenneth Baillie.

From the 1970s on, Mr. Baillie used video as well as film, working on a number of open-ended serial or multipart, often memoiristic films, including ""Roslyn Romance,"" ""The Holy Scrolls"" and ""Les Memoires d'un Ange (Remembering Life)."" For many critics, however, his finest films were his most concentrated, which often focused on a single location. ""Castro Street,"" which Mr. Baillie said was inspired by the composer Erik Satie, was filmed across the bay from San Francisco on a thoroughfare running through an industrial area of Richmond, Calif. The movie is a 10-minute technical tour de force, combining black-and-white and color film as well as positive and negative images, often superimposed, to transfigure a wasteland of oil refineries, factories and railroad yards into what Mr. Callenbach called ""a flowing lyric poem."" Mr. Baillie created some of the effects in the camera and others at the editing table. The fluid visual rhythms are complemented by a soundtrack of abstracted industrial noises. Mr. Baillie's gift for sound design was exemplified by the bright-hued and clamorous ""Valentin de las Sierras"" (1967), a 10-minute film shot in Jalisco, Mexico, with a hand-held 16-millimeter camera. A vivid succession of often extreme close-ups is structured around the well-known Mexican corrido, or ballad, for which the movie is named. Writing about ""Valentin"" in the magazine Cinema Scope, the critic Chuck Stephens called it ""a sun-drenched hallucination"" in which ""a plaintively strummed rendition of the corrido fuses with the ambient burble and swell all around it; the camera alights on the carved, fish-headed cane of the blind and weathered singer; sunlight dances on the bare knee of a child. We hear what we see, though always slightly dis-aligned and carefully re-intertwined."" One of Mr. Baillie's most beloved films was also among his simplest. ""All My Life"" (1966), characterized by Mr. Mekas as a ""koan,"" appears to be a two-and-a-half-minute lateral tracking shot along a worn straight picket fence overgrown with wildflowers and occasional rose bushes.

""The shot -- and the film -- lasts as long as it takes for Ella Fitzgerald to sing the song of the film's title,"" Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times in 2011. The film, she added, ""ends with a pan up to the sky, a gesture that is an ecstatic punctuation mark on a film revelation."" The fence is real, but the straightness of it is an optical illusion; at one point the camera pans by a right-angle corner of it concealed by a rose bush, though the viewer is unaware of the change in direction. As Mr. Sitney wrote after viewing the film more than 100 times, Mr. Baillie's ""genius consisted in realizing that there must be a single point in which to plant his tripod so that the panning movement would seem to keep the fence equidistant at all its moments.""","He became known in the mid-1960s for his lyrical landscape films.

Opinion,Will the Coronavirus Cause a Recession?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/15/opinion/china-economy-coronavirus.html,"The rapid spread of the coronavirus is a tough blow for a world economy that seemed on the cusp of a modest revival. The extent of the damage, of course, depends on how soon and how effectively the outbreak is contained. Whatever the trajectory of the epidemic, this is a moment of serious reckoning for China's economy. Hard as it is to envision, the world's second-largest economy is coming to a near standstill. Infections and fatalities are mounting. Many of my acquaintances and friends in China tell me they are increasingly concerned about the government's ability to control the epidemic and its economic fallout. Big urban manufacturing and financial centers remain on at least partial lockdown, migrant laborers are unable to return to work, and factories are unable to get raw materials or ship their goods out reliably. Consumption has also been cut drastically, as people mostly stay indoors. Service industries such as tourism and restaurants are being hit especially hard. Companies in this sector, as well as small manufacturers, have been driving China's employment growth, but they tend to have little financial cushion. Beijing does have room to increase public spending, cut taxes and provide cheap credit to bolster growth. China's central bank has already taken measures to loosen monetary policy. Flooding the economy with cheap credit will increase risks to the banking system, which the government recognizes, but these are desperate times.

In any event, none of these measures will have much impact until commercial activity picks up. Moreover, China's traditional banking system has been much better at funneling credit to large, state-owned enterprises rather than to the struggling smaller private companies. China's sheer size, along with its roles as an engine of global economic growth and a dominant player in commodity markets, means that a hit to China will have significant ramifications all over the world. Oil prices have tumbled as China's growth prospects weaken and international travel, particularly to and from China, decreases. This episode will also add momentum to some changes in global supply chains that were already underway. Along with Chinese workers' rising wages and the prospects of further U.S.-China trade tensions, the epidemic is likely to cause multinational companies to reassess their supply chains and reduce their production footprints in China. The coronavirus epidemic might have only a limited immediate impact on the U.S. economy, but by creating further uncertainty and disrupting supply chains in Asia, it will add to the long list of factors likely to hold back U.S. and global growth in 2020. The temporary boost in business sentiment and investment that could have been expected from the U.S.-China trade deal last month is going to be offset by this new cloud of uncertainty over global trade. A worldwide recession is not yet on the cards but, at a minimum, the added uncertainty will restrain investment and productivity, which already looked anemic in all major economies. Another long-lasting impact is likely to be on Chinese citizens' confidence in their own government. The state and its people seem to have made an implicit bargain: good economic performance, higher living standards and the semblance of social stability in exchange for constraints on free expression, democratic rights and the free flow of information.

Yet even in an environment where it is accepted that the authorities will control what information is made public, the public grows skeptical about the competence of a government that systematically hides bad news. This issue is especially pertinent in the context of the Chinese government's initial attempts to play down the outbreak of swine flu last year. By the time the government admitted to the scale of the problem, China's pig herds had been decimated and pork prices had doubled. Now, coronavirus is spreading fast in a country that was already experiencing a slowdown from the swine flu and an outbreak of avian flu that could reduce chicken flocks. Trust in information provided by the government and its competence to manage these problems are under question, both domestically and abroad. The way the coronavirus epidemic is playing out might have lessons not just for China's government but perhaps for the United States as well. Once trust in the government and a free press are eroded by the government's desire to manipulate information, the costs can be great -- especially in difficult times, when that trust becomes crucial for maintaining confidence and stability. If history is any guide, the coronavirus will eventually come under control and the Chinese and world economies will get back on track, perhaps after a painful period. It is the effects on how people and businesses perceive their governments that might prove to be longer lasting.

After playing too many games that didn't match her interests, Elizabeth Hargrave, the creator of Wingspan, decided to make one: ""Wouldn't it be great if we had Race for the Galaxy but with birds?""

C OLLEGE PARK, Md. -- The roseate spoonbill is roughly the size of a great blue heron, with the pink plumage of a flamingo and a giant spoon-shaped bill -- ""gorgeous at a distance and bizarre up close,"" according to the Audubon Guide to North American birds. It is Elizabeth Hargrave's favorite bird. ""Crazy bills get me,"" she said on a recent sunny Saturday. Ms. Hargrave, a health-policy consultant in Silver Spring, Md., is an avid birder, and her favorite local winter birding spot is the Lake Artemesia Natural Area. Fringed with woods, the lake is artificial, excavated during the construction of Washington's Green Line in the 1970s; in those days, the area was known as Lake Metro. Setting out on a trail around the lake, bird guide close at hand, Ms. Hargrave had barely set up her scope when she spotted another species of her beloved crazy-billed birds: ""Oh, fun!"" She'd caught two northern shovelers, their beaks submerged, trawling for invertebrates. ""There are diving ducks and dabbling ducks,"" she said. ""The northern shovelers are dabblers."" Ms. Hargrave is more diver than dabbler. A spreadsheet geek with a master's degree in public affairs, she spent more than a decade as a policy analyst with NORC at the University of Chicago. There, she studied, among other things, prescription drug trends for the report to Congress by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. She is now self-employed.

""I came for the social policy, wanting to help people,"" she said. ""But then, working in the field, I realized how much I also enjoy the crunchy analytics."" And in her spare time, she's been crossbreeding her analytics skills and her birding hobby to hatch something new: a board game, her first ever, about ... birds. In ""Wingspan,"" published Friday by Stonemaier Games, players assign birds with various powers -- represented by 170 illustrated cards, hand-drawn by two artists, Natalia Rojas and Ana Maria Martinez Jaramillo -- to wetland, grassland and forest habitats. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Aiming to design a game with scientific integrity, Ms. Hargrave pulled data on North American birds from eBird, a citizen-science project managed by the Cornell Lab of Ornithology. She also made use of the lab's All About Birds website, as well as Audubon's online guide. Then she built a spreadsheet. At its most extreme, it ran five hundred and ninety six rows by nearly one hundred columns -- sorting, for instance, by order, class, genus, habitat, wingspan, nest type, eggs, food and red-list status. (Endangered birds confer special powers.)

Ms. Hargrave also has a card game, Tussie Mussie, about the Victorian language of flowers, launching in May, and a game about monarch butterflies, with the working title Mariposas, due for release next year. She is among the few women in game design -- which was something she planned to research, until last December, when she noticed a newly published study exploring exactly that: ""Assessing Gender and Racial Representation in the Board Game Industry."" During the hundreds of Wingspan play tests, some gamers scratched their heads and said, ""Birds? Really!?"" They expressed concern that our feathered friends might not resonate with a community usually drawn to zombies, dragons, spaceships, farming, civilizations and (of course) trains. But during the pre-order period in January, more than 5,000 games sold in a week; the game is now on its third print run, with a total of 30,000 games in English, and 14,000 in various foreign-language editions. On official release day, demand so exceeded supply that the publisher issued a public apology. Between birders and gamers, and the birder-gamer hybrid, Wingspan has found its followers -- especially, naturally, on Twitter. Ms. Hargrave's home habitat, which she shares with her landscape-designer husband, Matt Cohen, is its own nature reserve, with vegetables in the backyard and a row of blueberry bushes out front. Inside, her watercolor paintings, of mushrooms and wildflowers, hang on the walls, complemented here and there with shells, snake skins and animal skulls. The idea for Wingspan came to her after a game night with friends. They got talking about why there weren't any board games tied to subjects they found interesting. Ms. Hargrave loves the game Castles of Burgundy, but pretending to be an aristocrat in high medieval France isn't exactly her thing. She wondered, ""Wouldn't it be great if we had Race for the Galaxy"" -- another game that often hits her table, about building galactic civilizations -- ""but with birds?"" Wingspan bills itself as a card-driven, engine-building board game: players start with limited strength and slowly assemble their gameplay mechanism, which becomes more powerful with each turn. A classic example is Monopoly, in which players accrete real-estate empires, although hobby gamers would point to more sophisticated examples, such as Terraforming Mars.

Wirecutter, a product review site owned by The New York Times, has a guide to the best beginner board games for adults. In Wingspan, the assets from which players reap points are the birds, their eggs and their food sources. Each player assumes the role of a birder, collecting birds and deciding which to deploy on the board and cultivate. For instance, the roseate spoonbill is worth six points at the end of the game. Once it is placed in the wetland habitat (at the food cost of one invertebrate, one seed and one fish), it can lay two eggs, which also generate points. And as its special power, it allows the player to draw two new bonus cards and keep one.

Game-design theory coalesced as a discipline barely two decades ago. It includes at least two competing perspectives: ludology (from the Latin ludus, ""play""), the study of game rules and mechanisms and narratology, the study of player story lines and experiences. Ms. Hargrave is familiar with the philosophy. But taped to the wall facing her is a list of the essential elements outlined by Marc LeBlanc, a designer and programmer, in his book ""Eight Kinds of Fun"": sensation, fantasy, narrative, challenge, fellowship, discovery, expression and submission. Every so often, she said, she asks herself, ""How many of these am I using?"" ""The beginning of the game design process is about finding the fun,"" said Matthew O'Malley, a game designer and one of Ms. Hargrave's perpetual play testers. ""The focus is on creating interesting decisions."" At each turn, do you want to play a bird, or gain food, or lay an egg or draw a new card?

""Later you focus on the mathematics of things, making sure that everything is balanced, and that players feel everything is fair,"" he said. Where Wingspan really succeeds, he added, is in giving players lots of agency. It offers numerous paths to victory (the Holy Grail in game design) without inducing ""analysis paralysis."" ""There has to be some human spark"" On Sunday, the day after birding at Lake Artemesia, Ms. Hargrave was up early for her monthly play-testing session -- a focus group with gamers -- at the Board and Brew Cafe in College Park. The ""Break My Game"" crew, with 20 or so players, was in the back corner as usual, digging into half-baked games over pancakes and avocado toast. Kyle Catanzaro, 14, was there to play-test his game Monaxem, which he loosely translates to ""chuck"" in Latin (Marmota monax being the scientific name of the woodchuck). It's a card game, with sixty tokens -- ""a food fight gone mental,"" he said, but with ""psychotic chickens and angry yetis."" Franklin Kenter, a mathematician at the United States Naval Academy, was testing his card game, Bobsled, with players arranging their chairs in a cozy line rather than at a table. Ms. Hargrave was there seeking feedback on Wingspan's first expansion deck, and wanted to test out the new bird powers. (Several new decks of bird cards are in the works, one for each continent.) The game neatly combines and disguises a great deal of math: the probability of acquiring certain food items with the roll of dice; the balance between a bird's cost, in food, and how its powers play out at different points in the game. ""There's a large amount of math under the hood,"" said Mr. Kenter, a steadfast Wingspan tester. ""But you don't need to know the math to play the game.""

By the end of the Sunday session, Ms. Hargrave was feeling good about the expansion deck. ""It's close,"" she said. She gave it another test the following weekend, at an invite-only 12-hour play test party at the home of Steve Cole, a game designer. She also spent time that day play testing a game called Symposium, by Dan Cassar. It's a card game about competing theories during the time of the scientific revolution; the players are wealthy patrons, exerting their influence over which papers get published, and which never see the light of day. Near the end of March, Ms. Hargrave is off to Baltimore, for the annual Unpub convention, where hundreds of designers and thousands of gamers spend the weekend play testing games in various stages of undone. Ms. Hargrave had an idea for a game about mushrooms, but she thought instead she might test a game about a Russian experiment breeding foxes into dogs. A couple of days later, she shelved that idea. ""It needs quite a bit of work,"" she said. But she has no shortage of options: ""I also made a quickie prototype this week of a game about stunt people, which would be way more silly, and probably more fun.""",How Elizabeth Hargrave turned a passion for ornithology and spreadsheets into a popular game about birds.,90e252ef-5f9a-5d44-895d-9a39661e86db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/13/science/12SCI-WINGSPAN4/12SCI-WINGSPAN4-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=992300afb3a1ba8f2ea4a099f8ccf6a938368b27f246a43dcd9b11934a40f57a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"On a recent Saturday, Ms. Hargrave, right, auditioned a Wingspan expansion deck at a play-testing session.",90e252ef-5f9a-5d44-895d-9a39661e86db,N24News/imgs/90e252ef-5f9a-5d44-895d-9a39661e86db.jpg,2
Economy,"Simmering for Decades, Anger About Trade Boils Over in '16 Election",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/30/business/economy/trade-donald-trump-bernie-sanders.html,"WASHINGTON -- The United States is in the midst of one of the longest economic expansions in its history. Even American factories have lately added hundreds of thousands of jobs. Meanwhile, the rest of the world is stumbling. Even China. Yet at perhaps the least likely moment in the last several decades, misgivings about globalization are playing a starring role in the presidential election. Why now? Anger about unbalanced trade has helped to fuel the rise of Donald J. Trump, the Republican front-runner, and the success of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his bid for the Democratic nomination. The manifest anger also has pushed their principal rivals, Republican Senator Ted Cruz and the Democratic front-runner, Hillary Clinton, to toughen their own trade rhetoric.

 It is a situation that has surprised many experts because polls show voters' concern about the overall health of the American economy has declined significantly in recent years.

Yet many Americans are just taking stock of the transformations wrought by global trade. In two dozen conversations with voters across the country, only two said they had heard of the proposed new trade deal, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, involving the United States and a host of Pacific Rim nations. Instead, the concerns they expressed were about changes in their own lives and communities over the last couple of decades. ""When we first did that big trade agreement I thought it was a good idea, but now I'm getting a little more conservative about it,"" said Phyllis Arthur, a 74-year-old Republican from Walnut Creek, Calif. ""I think we're being overwhelmed by the goods coming in. That's practically all that's available in the stores."" Kevin White, a 47-year-old Democrat from Dayton, Ohio, said it was hard to find a job. He used to work at a hospital; now he gets federal disability payments. ""The jobs went overseas,"" lamented Mr. White. ""Then people couldn't afford their mortgages and we had a crash and nobody was able to buy anything.""

Douglas Irwin, an economist at Dartmouth College who studies trade, said the impact of China's economic rise had become more visible in recent years, even though the worst effects of its rise may already be in the past. Between 2000 and 2011, imports from China grew to equal 2.6 percent of American economic output, up from around 1 percent. That ""unprecedented shock"" was much larger than that from the increase in Japanese imports in the 1980s or Mexican imports in the 1990s, Mr. Irwin said. China's rise, fueled in part by currency manipulation to make its exports cheaper, played a key role in the loss of roughly five million American manufacturing jobs. Those losses, however, were offset and obscured during the housing boom by a rise in construction jobs. Now, both the factory jobs and the construction jobs have gone away. Rationally, said Mr. Irwin, ""It's too late to get upset about China."" The United States is no longer losing factory jobs. It has added 600,000 over the last five years. Beijing is no longer suppressing its currency; it's now trying to prop up the value. Politically, however, it appears that the moment is perfectly ripe. Ahead of another Rust Belt primary next Tuesday in Wisconsin, Mr. Trump is pressing for ""fair trade"" with foreign countries, while Mr. Cruz has adopted similar language. ""We're going to see millions and millions of new high paying jobs,"" Mr. Cruz told a crowd at an Oshkosh plastics factory on Monday, ""coming back to America, coming back from China, coming back from Mexico."" Personalities also appear to be playing a role. Mr. Trump has proved an unusually effective spokesman for concerns among Republican voters. ""You look at those empty factories all over the place, and nobody hits that message better than me,"" he said after winning the Republican primary in Michigan this month.

Mr. Trump and Mr. Sanders have also succeeded in focusing anger on trade as an explanation for broader economic problems afflicting many Americans. Trade flows make up a small part of America's economic activity. The primary explanations for the stagnation of middle-class incomes are necessarily domestic. ""They are following in the footsteps of politicians of all stripes who have found it convenient to blame the boogeyman of unfair trade for domestic economic problems,"" said Eswar Prasad, a Cornell economist. ""Tough talk on trade is an easy way to distract attention from taking on difficult domestic challenges."" Mainstream economists regard the evidence as unequivocal that trade has produced significant benefits for the American economy and the average household. Yet much of the American public has long been skeptical. A recent New York Times/CBS News poll found that 61 percent of respondents favored more trade restrictions to protect domestic industry, just as a majority of respondents has favored increased restrictions in every such poll since 1988. Charles Shank began to change his mind about foreign trade in the early 2000s as he carried the pieces of Pennsylvania factories south to the Mexican border to be reassembled there. Mr. Shank, then working as a truck driver, supported the expansion of trade with Mexico and Canada. A registered Republican, Mr. Shank said he subscribed to the party's position that trade deals would open new markets for American companies.

But Mr. Shank, now retired, said the politicians made a mistake. He said he planned to vote in Pennsylvania's coming presidential primary for a candidate who would ""go back and renegotiate"" better deals with the nation's trading partners. ""I think our trade deals were good ideas with good intentions, but I don't think it had enough controls to protect the United States,"" said Mr. Shank, 65. ""The fact that the factories are leaving, there's something wrong with that whole system right there."" At the same time, Mr. Shank has personally benefited from globalization. He spent years driving imported goods to market. Trade reduced the price of his television and his clothing and increased the variety of food available at the local grocery store. Like many Americans, Mr. Shank said he would still rather pay more for American goods. A recent Bloomberg poll conducted by Selzer & Company found just 13 percent of respondents said they wanted goods at the lowest price, while 82 percent of respondents said they wanted goods made in America. Mr. Shank said he has always driven Dodge trucks. Economists and politicians understated the costs of globalization, which tend to be more concentrated than the benefits. Everyone gets a discount; some people lose their jobs. Moreover, the United States has lagged significantly behind other developed countries in providing support for those left behind. Linda Young lost a good job in 1998 when Munekata America, which made plastic cases for televisions and other electronics, closed its factory in Dalton, Ga., because most of the companies it served had moved to Mexico. Ms. Young worked until the factory's final day, packing equipment so it, too, could be shipped to Mexico.

Ms. Young, 62, ran a restaurant for a few years. She now cares for her grandchildren. Her children have navigated globalization with greater success. Her son works for an electric motor company that once served the carpet factories that dominated Dalton but now focuses on construction equipment. Her son-in-law lost his job at one of those carpet plants last year, after 26 years, but, a few months later, he found work at the new Volkswagen plant in nearby Chattanooga, Tenn. Ms. Young said she knew globalization had improved the lives of millions around the world. But she was thinking about Dalton's decline when she decided to vote for Mr. Trump in Georgia's Republican primary. ""I don't see their future being better than mine,"" Ms. Young said of her grandchildren. ""I understand we have to help others, but I think we should be a little more astute about helping ourselves.""","Bashing trade deals has proved a winning strategy for Donald Trump, but economists mostly agree they have benefited American households significantly.",76f0240a-3c40-572d-b31e-2aca2ac23510,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/30/business/30trade1/30trade1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=9673e66e362f80c99fd221014077588d1376b4415c45b0609fc3cac0edcbeb52&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A container port in Qingdao, in east China's Shandong Province.",76f0240a-3c40-572d-b31e-2aca2ac23510,N24News/imgs/76f0240a-3c40-572d-b31e-2aca2ac23510.jpg,8
Sports,"Harland Svare, 89, Giants Linebacker and Young Head Coach, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/27/sports/football/harland-svare-dead.html,"Harland Svare, who played linebacker in the celebrated defense that helped take the Giants to three N.F.L. championship games in the 1950s and became, at the time, the youngest head coach in the N.F.L.'s modern history when the Los Angeles Rams hired him in 1962, died on April 4 at a nursing home in Steamboat Springs, Colo. He was 89. Svare's death was confirmed on Monday by the Yampa Valley Funeral Home in Steamboat Springs. His son-in-law, Cory Anderson, said that the cause was listed as respiratory arrest, although he had tested negative for the coronavirus. Playing for eight pro seasons, his first two with the Rams before joining the Giants in 1955, Svare was acclaimed for his football smarts at a time when shouts of ""Dee-fense!"" cascaded from the stands at Yankee Stadium, the Giants' home field. Svare played in an innovative alignment installed by Tom Landry, the Giants' defensive coach, with four down linemen in place of the customary five- or six-men lines, a strategy to stymie the growing emphasis on the short passing game.

Lining up at left linebacker, Svare was positioned alongside Sam Huff, the middle linebacker, whose ferocious tackling, portrayed in the CBS documentary ""The Violent World of Sam Huff,"" came to glamorize defensive play. Together with Bill Svoboda and later Cliff Livingston at right linebacker, they played behind an outstanding front four, with Andy Robustelli and Jim Katcavage at the ends and Roosevelt Grier and Dick Modzewleski at the tackles, and in front of a secondary that included Emlen Tunnell and Jim Patton at safety and Dick Lynch at cornerback. The Giants routed the Chicago Bears, 47-7, in the 1956 N.F.L. championship game, then lost to the Baltimore Colts in the memorable 1958 sudden-death overtime title game and again in 1959. At 6 feet tall and 215 pounds or so, Svare was relatively undersized even for a linebacker of his time. ""Svare didn't have a muscle in his body, but he possessed remarkable intensity,"" Frank Gifford, the Giants' Hall of Fame back, recalled in ""The Whole Ten Yards"" (1994), a memoir written with Harry Waters Jr.

Svare became the Giants' defensive coach in 1960 even while continuing to play, after Landry had left to become head coach of the expansion Dallas Cowboys. He retired as a player but remained the defensive coach under Allie Sherman when Sherman succeeded Jim Lee Howell as the Giants' head coach in 1961. The Giants again went to an N.F.L. title game that season, losing to the Green Bay Packers. Svare left afterward to join the Rams as defensive line coach. He was named the head coach of a losing Rams team midway through the 1962 season without any head-coaching experience at the college or pro level. At 31 years, 11 months old, he became the youngest head coach in the National Football League's modern era, a distinction that has twice been eclipsed, by Lane Kiffin (31 years, 8 months), who was hired to lead the Oakland Raiders in 2007, and by Sean McVay, who holds the record as the youngest (30 year, 11 months), when he was named by the Rams in 2017. Svare's Rams went 0-5-1 for the remainder of the 1962 season, then posted losing records over the next three years. Svare was fired with a coaching record of 14-31-3. He was the Giants' defensive coach again in 1967 and 1968, then joined the Washington Redskins in 1969, overseeing their defense under Coach Vince Lombardi, the former Giants' offensive coordinator who had forged a Packer dynasty. Lombardi died of cancer in the summer of 1970, and Svare was out of a coaching job again. But he was hired by the floundering San Diego Chargers as their general manager in February 1971, replacing Sid Gillman, who remained as head coach.

Svare took over the coaching as well late in the 1971 season, his Chargers going 2-2 under him. In November 1972, the Chargers' owner, Eugene Klein, startled their fans when he gave Svare a new five-year coaching contract, though the team was continuing its losing ways. The Chargers finished that season at 4-9-1. The 1973 Chargers were at 1-6-1 when Svare resigned as coach, his teams having gone 7-17-2. After that season, the N.F.L. levied a total of $40,000 in fines against eight Charger players as well as Klein and Svare. The players were found to have possessed drugs, and Svare and Klein were penalized for lax oversight. The league did not disclose the nature of the drugs, but Svare said marijuana use was involved. At least one of the fined players said, however, that he had used amphetamines. Svare was fired as general manager in January 1976.

Harland James Svare was born on Nov. 15, 1930, in Clarkfield, Minn., in the rural southwest part of the state. His father, Rolf, and his mother, Inga (Niebokken) Svare, were farmers. He was a lineman at Washington State and was selected by the Rams in the 17th round of the 1953 N.F.L. draft. Since he came from a state with a large Scandinavian population, he became known as Swede Svare, which was presumably pleasing on the tongue, although he was of Norwegian descent. Svare had nine career pass interceptions, one for a 70-yard touchdown run, and recovered five fumbles. He blocked a late Detroit Lions field-goal attempt to preserve a 19-17 victory leading to the Giants' overtaking the Cleveland Browns to reach the 1958 N.F.L. championship game. He was named a second-team All-Pro by United Press International that season. After leaving football, he founded an institute devoted to physical therapy and promotion of good health habits.","Brainy more than brawny, he helped put New York in three title games, then became, with the Rams, the youngest head coach in modern N.F.L. history at the time.",d1b0f840-772d-5a18-94e5-fd3654b00ac3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/28/obituaries/26Svare/26Svare-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=42e24ef3a636ba5737bb81f27ad60013730e874410076f97c9f58eca4e07f542&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Harland Svare, as a Giants linebacker, in November 1959.

Health,When Gene Tests for Breast Cancer Reveal Grim Data but No Guidance,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/12/health/breast-cancer-brca-genetic-testing.html,"At a time when genetic testing and genetically personalized treatments for cancer are proliferating, buoyed by new resources like President Obama's $215 million personalized medicine initiative, women with breast cancer are facing a frustrating reality: The genetic data is there, but in many cases, doctors do not know what to do with it. That was the situation Angie Watts, 44, faced after she walked into a radiation oncologist's office last June expecting to discuss the radiation therapy she was about to begin after a lumpectomy for breast cancer. Instead, Dr. Timothy M. Zagar of the University of North Carolina looked down at a sheet of test results and delivered some shocking news. A genetic test showed she had inherited an alteration in a gene needed to repair DNA. Radiation breaks DNA, so the treatment might actually spur the growth of her cancer, he said. He urged her not to take the risk and to have a double mastectomy instead. ""I'm not a betting man,"" he said in a recent interview. Shaken, Ms. Watts called Dr. James P. Evans, a professor of genetics and medicine at North Carolina. He told her the opposite: The mutation she had was not known to be harmful, so he urged her to go ahead with the radiation.

A group of doctors met but could not reach a consensus, so, Ms. Watts said, ""they left it up to me to decide."" Ms. Watts's experience highlights an unsettling side to the growing use of genetics in medicine, particularly breast cancer care. Doctors have long been tantalized by a future in which powerful methods of genetic testing would allow treatments to be tailored to a patient's genetic makeup. Today, in breast cancer treatment, testing of tumors and healthy cells to look for mutations has become standard. But as Ms. Watts found out, ""our ability to sequence genes has gotten ahead of our ability to know what it means,"" said Eric P. Winer, the director of the breast oncology program at Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. The ambiguities and disappointments play out in two areas: There is genetic testing of patients to see if they inherited mutations that predisposed them to cancer, and there is genetic testing of cells from the cancer to look for mutations that drive the tumor's growth -- but if found often cannot be targeted by any drug on the market. The ability to understand and interpret genetic tests will surely improve. But for now, what sounds like a simple test can leave patients with frightening information but no clear options or guidance for treatment decisions.

""The stakes are very high,"" said Dr. Evans, the geneticist who counseled Ms. Watts. ""You have inherently nuanced and confusing tests and widespread ordering and interpretation by doctors who aren't really equipped to do so,"" he said. ""The situation is ripe for overinterpretation and misinterpretation."" Oncologists say it still makes sense to order these tests, which identify mutations in as many as 100 genes. If they find mutations that greatly increase risk of cancer, that is valuable information. But patients need to be prepared for ambiguities. ""Typically they are not,"" said Dr. Elizabeth E. Campbell, an oncologist and former director of the Duke Women's Cancer Center. In Ms. Watts's case, the mutation was a medical mystery known as a ""a variation of unknown significance."" That means it does not destroy the gene's function but may alter it -- leaving the implications entirely uncertain. With each gene being tested, there is about a 5 percent chance of finding a variation of unknown significance. So as more and more genes are tested, ambiguous changes can add up fast. A recent article published in JAMA Oncology involving 897 women 40 and younger with breast cancer found that nearly all had tests for mutations in the BRCA1 and 2 genes, which can increase breast cancer risk. Most did not have known mutations. But the chance of having a mutation of unknown significance -- 4.6 percent -- was the same as the 4.5 percent chance of having a known and risky mutation in the BRCA2 gene.

Ms. Watts eventually decided to have radiation therapy and did well. But, she said, ""It was scary. There are times I regret ever having genetic testing."" A couple of decades ago, breast cancer seemed to be on the leading edge of personalized treatments. The first precision medicine drug, Herceptin, was developed and approved for a subset of breast cancer patients in the 1990s. Yet now, as powerful new precision medicine drugs elicit striking responses in patients with other cancers -- lung, colon, melanoma, blood, gastric -- metastatic breast cancer patients have been left out. ""It's like standing outside a candy store on Sunday when the store is closed, looking in the window,"" said Dr. Gabriel N. Hortobagyi, a director of breast cancer research at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. There is no obvious reason breast cancer in particular should be so resistant to new therapies. But the situation is one of the starkest examples of the frustrating reality of precision medicine today. While labs can test for hundreds of genes that have been linked to cancer, and while the tests may find likely culprits, there all too often is nothing that can be done. ""As a concept, it is beautiful,"" Dr. Hortobagyi said. ""In practice, we face a number of obstacles. Most breast cancers have not just one but four, six, 10, sometimes 15 or 20 mutations. So which is the driver mutation and which are the passengers? That's a tall order."" Even if investigators have a good idea of which mutation to go after, there may be no drug that blocks it. Or there may be a drug being tested in a clinical trial but the woman is not eligible because, for example, she has had two rounds of chemotherapy and the trial's rules say she can have no more than one.

Or there is a drug that was approved for a different cancer, but it costs more than $100,000 a year and her insurer will not pay. Sometimes, a drug that works against a mutation in one type of cancer also works against that same mutation in another cancer, but sometimes it does not. Dr. Norman Sharpless, the director of the Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at North Carolina, estimates that perhaps one in 1,000 women with advanced breast cancer will benefit from using the approved and experimental drugs available today. ""There are a few who benefit tremendously, but when patients come in expecting a cure, most are disappointed,"" he said. Heather Lynn Bowler's experience was typical. Mrs. Bowler, a 38-year-old office manager who lives in Raleigh, N.C., learned she had breast cancer in November 2013 and had eight rounds of intense chemotherapy and a lumpectomy that seemed to have taken care of it. Then, last April, her cancer came back, having spread outside her breast. In May, Mrs. Bowler started the first of 18 rounds of chemotherapy. During her first chemotherapy visit, her oncologist, Dr. Campbell, asked if she would be interested in having her tumor's genes sequenced. A month later, the results were in. Mrs. Bowler's tumor had mutated genes, but none of the mutations could be attacked with today's experimental drugs or with drugs being used in other cancers. ""The results added nothing to her care,"" Dr. Campbell said. ""Nothing."" Dr. Campbell is, however, confident that someday genetic testing in breast cancer will bear fruit. For now, she says, oncologists are left in a difficult situation. Should they even suggest genetic tests? ""We are trying to find avenues of hope that aren't just avenues of hype,"" she said.",The results from genetic tests can leave patients with frightening information but no clear guidance to fight the disease.,01e9df07-d7eb-5ce3-9e73-3f073ce713c6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/12/science/12CANCER/12CANCER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a73f1d7611abdf634a4789c9e078a309c3efc7e18b5a27a84882da690c75244e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Angie Watts received conflicting medical opinions after a genetic test revealed she had inherited a gene mutation.,01e9df07-d7eb-5ce3-9e73-3f073ce713c6,N24News/imgs/01e9df07-d7eb-5ce3-9e73-3f073ce713c6.jpg,1
Opinion,"The Supreme Court, Too, Is on the Brink",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/04/opinion/sunday/supreme-court-religion-coronavirus.html,"The Supreme Court made the indisputably right call last week when it refused to block California from limiting attendance at religious services in an effort to control the spread of Covid-19. A Southern California church, represented by a Chicago-based organization, the Thomas More Society, which most often defends anti-abortion activists, had sought the justices' intervention with the argument that by limiting worshipers to the lesser of 25 percent of building capacity or 100 people, while setting a 50 percent occupancy cap on retail stores, California was discriminating against religion in violation of the Constitution's Free Exercise Clause. Given the obvious difference between walking through a store and sitting among fellow worshipers for an hour or more, as well as the documented spread of the virus through church attendance in such places as Sacramento (71 cases), Seattle (32 cases) and South Korea (over 5,000 cases traced to one person at a religious service), California's limits are both sensitive and sensible, hardly the basis for constitutional outrage or judicial second-guessing. So why did the court's order, issued as midnight approached on Friday night, fill me with dread rather than relief?

It was because in a ruling that should have been unanimous, the vote was 5 to 4. And it was because of who the four dissenters were: the four most conservative justices, two of them appointed by the president who a couple of months ago was demanding that churches be allowed to open by Easter and who, even before the murder of George Floyd in Minneapolis, was openly encouraging protests in the capitals of states not reopening as quickly as he would like. As an astonished country witnessed on Monday night, as he held a Bible in front of a church near the White House after demonstrators were violently cleared from his path, Donald Trump is using religion as a cultural wedge to deflect attention from the consequences of his own ineptitude. The recognition that four Supreme Court justices -- Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh -- would have invoked the court's power to undermine fact-based public policy in the name of a misbegotten claim of religious discrimination was beyond depressing. It was terrifying. Does that sound like an overstatement? Take a look at Justice Kavanaugh's dissenting opinion. ""California's latest safety guidelines discriminate against places of worship and in favor of comparable secular businesses,"" he wrote. ""Such discrimination violates the First Amendment."" It's interesting that while Justices Gorsuch and Thomas signed Justice Kavanaugh's opinion, Justice Alito did not. Perhaps he's just too good a lawyer to subscribe to the flimsy analysis underlying this opinion. Fair enough, but he evidently couldn't be bothered to explain his own dissenting vote. And no less than his fellow dissenters, he obviously inhaled the unfounded claim of religious discrimination that the president has injected into an atmosphere already saturated with polarizing rhetoric. Here's what's wrong with the Kavanaugh opinion: He throws words around imprecisely in a context where precision is everything. The state's rules ""discriminate."" We're all against discrimination. But what does this potent word mean? To discriminate, in the way law uses the word, means to treat differently things that are alike, without a good reason for doing so. That's why racial discrimination, for example, is almost always unconstitutional. People are people regardless of their race, and the government needs a powerful reason for using race to treat people differently.

The concept of discrimination, properly understood, simply doesn't fit this case. California is not subjecting things that are alike to treatment that's different. Churches are not like the retail stores or ""cannabis dispensaries"" in Justice Kavanaugh's list of ""comparable secular businesses."" Sitting in communal worship for an hour or more is not like picking up a prescription, or a pizza, or an ounce of marijuana. You don't need a degree in either law or public health to figure that out. If anything, California is giving churches preferential treatment, since other places where people gather in large numbers like lecture halls and theaters are still off limits. So what was the dissenters' problem? Justice Kavanaugh's opinion offers a clue. The Christian observance of Pentecost was last Sunday, and the clock was ticking as the justices considered the South Bay United Pentecostal Church's request. ""The church would suffer irreparable harm from not being able to hold services on Pentecost Sunday in a way that comparable secular businesses and persons can conduct their activities,"" Justice Kavanaugh wrote. What does that sentence even mean? What's the secular comparator when it comes to observing Pentecost? A Sunday afternoon softball game? I'm baffled by why a particular liturgical observance should have even a walk-on role in this opinion. Last weekend was also Shavuot, a major Jewish holiday. But it's the Christian calendar about which recently appointed federal judges seem exclusively concerned. In April, Judge Justin Walker of the Federal District Court in Louisville, Ky., blocked that city from enforcing a ban on drive-in church services. ""On Holy Thursday, an American mayor criminalized the communal celebration of Easter,"" his overheated opinion began. (Judge Walker is Senator Mitch McConnell's young protege who, barring a miracle or a pair of righteous Republican senators, is on the verge of confirmation to the powerful federal appeals court in Washington, D.C.). In any event, no one was stopping the church from observing Pentecost. As its own brief points out, the church conducts as many as five services on a typical Sunday, each attracting 200 to 300 worshipers. As the state points out, it could schedule more services. The only other opinion filed in this case was that of Chief Justice John Roberts, explaining why the court was denying the church's request. I am willing to bet that he never intended to write anything; orders denying applications of this sort are typically issued without explanation. But he must have concluded that the Kavanaugh dissent couldn't go unrebutted. Writing just for himself in five paragraphs devoid of rhetoric and labeled ""concurring in denial of application for injunctive relief,"" he offered a sober explanation of the obvious. He noted that ""similar or more severe restrictions apply to comparable secular gatherings, including lectures, concerts, movie showings, spectator sports, and theatrical performances, where large groups of people gather in close proximity for extended periods of time."" The California rule, he observed, ""exempts or treats more leniently only dissimilar activities, such as operating grocery stores, banks, and laundromats, in which people neither congregate in large groups nor remain in close proximity for extended periods."" After noting the severity of the pandemic and the ""dynamic and fact-intensive"" question of how to respond to it, Chief Justice Roberts said that the politically accountable state officials charged with answering that question were entitled to act within ""broad limits"" and ""should not be subject to second-guessing by an unelected federal judiciary, which lacks the background, competence, and expertise to assess public health and is not accountable to the people.""

Predictably, the chief justice was excoriated on the political right, in recognition that his vote was the one that mattered, just as in the Obamacare case eight years ago, for which the right has never forgiven him. ""It wasn't just religious liberty that Chief Justice Roberts strangled,"" read the headline on a piece in The Hill by Andrew McCarthy, a reliable ally of the president. The Wall Street Journal accused Chief Justice Roberts of ""faux judicial modesty,"" in an echo, which the chief justice surely didn't miss, of the ""faux judicial restraint"" critique that Justice Antonin Scalia hurled at him early in his Supreme Court tenure. Everyone who cares about the Supreme Court is busy looking for signs of how John Roberts will navigate the political thicket in which the court finds itself, how he will reconcile his conservative heart and his institution- and history-minded head. Until recently, I thought I saw signs that at least he wasn't completely alone, that Brett Kavanaugh was evolving into something of a soul mate, willing to stand with the chief and provide a bit of cover. For example, the court just last week turned down a Trump administration request to block a federal district judge's order to consider moving hundreds of medically vulnerable inmates out of a low-security federal prison in Ohio. The unsigned order noted only that ""Justice Thomas, Justice Alito and Justice Gorsuch would grant the application."" (Note that these three observed the norm, in cases that reach the court in this posture, of noting their dissent without further explanation.) On the mental chart that I maintain of such developments, Justice Kavanaugh's refusal to join the three dissenters was a data point. But then came the California church case. Justice Kavanaugh might have chosen to observe the norm, casting his vote without issuing an opinion that served only to raise the political temperature. Instead of that unspoken gesture toward collegiality, he gave us more proof that the polarization roiling the country has the Supreme Court in its grip. The court can't save us; that much is clear.

Sports,"Mike Storen, 84, Dies; Ran a Basketball League and Three Teams",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/sports/basketball/mike-storen-84-dies-ran-a-basketball-league-and-three-teams.html,"Mike Storen in an undated photo. ""We don't have any ballplayers, we don't have films on the top college prospects, we don't even have an office,"" he said on joining the Pacers in 1967.





Mike Storen, a peripatetic sports executive who, during the brief life of the upstart American Basketball Association in the 1960s and '70s, ran three teams and was the league's commissioner, died on May 7 in Atlanta. He was 84. The cause was complications of a rare form of cancer, said his daughter, Hannah Storm, an anchor for ESPN's SportsCenter. When Mr. Storen was hired by the Indiana Pacers as its general manager in 1967, the A.B.A. was about to start its inaugural season as a flashy alternative to the older National Basketball Association. It used a patriotic red, white and blue ball and adopted the three-point field goal, from at least 25 feet from the basket. He had no experience in talent evaluation but had some basketball experience, having held jobs in the N.B.A. with the Baltimore Bullets (now the Washington Wizards) and the Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings).

""Our biggest problem now is one of time,"" Mr. Storen said at a news conference to announce his hiring by the Pacers. ""We don't have any ballplayers, we don't have films on the top college prospects, we don't even have an office."" Operating at first from the back of a jewelry store in Indianapolis, he began to build the team. He signed Roger Brown, a high school sensation from Brooklyn who had been blacklisted by the N.B.A. for his ties to a notorious gambler and was working in an automobile plant in Dayton, Ohio; traded for the center Mel Daniels, a great rebounder, in 1968; and hired Bob Leonard, known as Slick, to be the coach.

Mr. Storen displayed cunning as well. In 1969, both the A.B.A. and the N.B.A. coveted Lew Alcindor (later known as Kareem Abdul-Jabbar), the sensational center from U.C.L.A. To lure Alcindor (if not to the Pacers, then to another A.B.A. team) Mr. Storen concocted a scheme he called Operation Kingfish. It included developing a psychological profile of Alcindor, hiring a private detective to follow him and trying to get Howard Hughes to put up $1 million to sign him in exchange for syndicated TV rights.

But Mr. Hughes never met with them, and Alcindor signed with the N.B.A.'s Milwaukee Bucks. Still, the Pacers improved under Mr. Storen and won the 1970 A.B.A. championship, but he left a week later for another A.B.A. team, the Kentucky Colonels, as their president and general manager. ""I am not the least concerned about the ability of the A.B.A. to survive, no matter what,"" he said confidently on joining the Colonels. The Colonels became a dominant team as well, in part because Mr. Storen outbid other teams for the draft rights to the center Artis Gilmore, who, along with the forward Dan Issel, formed the nucleus of the team that won the 1975 A.B.A. title. But by then Mr. Storen had also left that team after a dispute with the owner, John Y. Brown. Mark Storen Jr. was born on Sept. 14, 1935, in Michigan City, Ind. His father was a lawyer and a judge. His mother, Marion Lois (Riley) Storen, was a teacher and a prison clerk. To distinguish Mark Jr. from his father, his family called him Mike. Mr. Storen graduated from the University of Notre Dame and then served five years in the Marines. After his discharge, he read a newspaper article reporting that a young N.B.A. team, the Chicago Zephyrs, had sold only 600 season tickets for the 1963 season. He called the team and got an appointment with one of its owners. ""I guaranteed him that if he'd hire me, I'd sell 600 new ones by myself,"" Mr. Storen told Sports Illustrated in 1974. He got the job as promotion director and moved with the team to Baltimore, where it was renamed the Bullets. He joined the Cincinnati Royals two years later as promotion and ticket sales director After running the Pacers and the Colonels, he was named the league's fifth commissioner in six years in 1973. Like his predecessors, he was unable to secure a national TV deal that would have shored up the league's finances. But he did revive an antitrust lawsuit against the N.B.A., which became part of a legal battle that ultimately led to the league's merger in 1976.",He was commissioner of the upstart American Basketball Association and built the Indiana Pacers and the Kentucky Colonels into champions.,9a10d722-b6a1-5aa5-96f7-a99f18a27f62,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/obituaries/14storen1/merlin_172452288_4703aaa6-03a0-4885-8d50-eae99455cacf-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=411&w=786&s=0b0ff3661356e2a1efeca48a9220e7b2de18cdc3ce5eb3cea9002385abed809d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mike Storen in an undated photo. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t have any ballplayers, we don&rsquo;t have films on the top college prospects, we don&rsquo;t even have an office,&rdquo; he said on joining the Pacers in 1967.",9a10d722-b6a1-5aa5-96f7-a99f18a27f62,N24News/imgs/9a10d722-b6a1-5aa5-96f7-a99f18a27f62.jpg,9
Art & Design,"Raymond Pettibon, Wielding an Art Mightier Than the Sword",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/09/arts/design/raymond-pettibon-new-museum.html,"Surfing has been a recurrent theme for Mr. Pettibon. From left, ""No Title (Think, How Were),"" 2011; ""No Title (As to Me),"" 2015; and ""No Title (Let Me Say),"" 2012.

To hazards like icecap cracks, nuclear leaks and rising seas, add another environmental threat: language fallout. Never has verbiage, generated by advertising, the entertainment industry and mouthy politicians, been so present and pervasive in everyday life, seeping from smartphones, spewing from flat screens. And few artists have more cannily predicted and reflected, not to mention contributed to, this phenomenon than Raymond Pettibon, whose career retrospective, with more than 700 annotated drawings and paintings, fills three floors and the lobby of the New Museum.

Nearly every piece in ""Raymond Pettibon: A Pen of All Work"" is dominated by an image. Most are done in pen and ink, and sometimes paint, on notebook-size sheets of paper in a wired, graphic style. But many of the images -- of Joan Crawford, or Jesus, or a surfer, or an explosion -- are unremarkable in themselves, and made interesting primarily by the presence of handwritten phrases and sentences above, below and around them.

Some of these texts seem to be lifted from B-movie scripts, others from classical literature, still others from the sort of reactive interior rants that some of us drop into unguarded subway moments. Over all, Mr. Pettibon's art has the prickly, manic feel of such rants, and like them, it rarely achieves smooth resolution. Words and pictures are often out of logical sync. He titles many pieces ""No Title,"" followed by a bit of quoted text. Only in his most overtly political work do all components align and fuse, defining and sharpening one another.

And Mr. Pettibon is, with gratifying regularity, a sharp political critic. It is the most interesting thing about him. His targets can be quite specific: the drug-wrecked hippie movement of the 1960s, the American war in Iraq. Yet his entire output, despite interludes of lyricism and nostalgia, and a running strain of stand-up humor, is a steady indictment of American culture as he has lived it over the past 60 years. He was born in 1957 in Tucson, but grew up in Southern California. By the time he had hit his teens, the Summer of Love had spawned Charles Manson, and the Vietnam War was poisoning the air. In 1976 his brother, Greg Ginn, founded the punk-rock band Black Flag. Mr. Pettibon (he invented his surname) supplied designs for the group's album covers, posters and fliers, and that's pretty much as far as his punk involvement went. For him, drawing was an end in itself. He'd been doing it since he was a kid, and the show opens on the New Museum's second floor with examples from his grade school years.

They set out themes that would follow him through his career: surfers, athletes, landscapes, war scenes, television stars. And the drawings would be pure juvenilia, were it not for later changes he made: In the mid-2000s, he added written texts. A crayon image of Nazi fighter planes now has a quotation from Marcel Proust. (""They are innocent enough as long as they are regarded as mere toys."") A pencil-drawn cowboy is encased in a conspiracy-theory account of the John F. Kennedy assassination. Over the head of a little figure wearing a sombrero is a one-line equivalent of men's room graffiti.

With the additions, the drawings suddenly become complicated and a lot to take in. And they're just the beginning of the show. In 1999 a traveling Pettibon survey came to the Drawing Center in SoHo. It had hundreds of pieces installed in one big room, and felt more than substantial. This retrospective, larger still, is exhaustingly huge. To ease matters, and make viewing more than a browse, the New Museum's curators, Gary Carrion-Murayari and Massimiliano Gioni, have grouped material on all three floors by theme rather than by date.

One section of the second floor is given over to what are identified as self-portraits. A few from the 1990s seem to fit the conventional description. They're headshot sketches of a soulful guy: He wrinkles his brow, sheds a tear, laments his loneliness. (""I'm not fin de siecle enough for her!"") Other images -- of a bodybuilder, of a puppet with wings -- are less easy to slot. And then there are alter egos as self-portraits, like the animated clay figure Gumby, remembered from childhood television. In Mr. Pettibon's hands, Gumby's days of innocence are long over. He is now a moral shape-shifter: in one drawing, a priapic imp; in another, a towering predator; in yet another, a bantamweight pugilist facing off with a giant volume of James Joyce, whom Mr. Pettibon quotes in his work.

The third floor takes the artist back to the very beginning of his career, 1978. Eager to find an audience for the kind of art he was making, which no gallery at the time would touch, he assembled his first zine, called Captive Chains. Filled with images adapted from film noir, soft porn, newspapers and comics, it was in a clean, easy-to-reproduce graphic style, as was the work that soon followed, including a series built around images of the cult leader and murderer Charles Manson and Flower Power gone to rot. These pictures were hits, and are still his most widely known. They're deeply creepy, beyond dystopian.

In the early 1990s, he had the art world's attention, and the work changed. Possibly the shift from a zine format to gallery display explains this. He loosened his line, upped his scale, eased off on irony and moved toward painting. He did a spectacular series of surfing pictures, all big blue waves, and another of interiors of Gothic cathedrals. In both, figures are reduced to specks or eliminated. Texts are so small as to be barely visible. Experimentation with color and line is the story here, and in the retrospective, it comes as a relief: finally art that invites maximum looking and requires minimum reading.

But as good as it is, I miss the words, the talk, the twitchy, out-of-nowhere language that sets him apart. You can get a dose of it by following his closely tracked Twitter feed, @RaymondPettibon, an art world phenomenon in itself. And there's a large, powerful concentration of it in a selection of political work on the museum's fourth floor. The selection starts with a lineup of authoritarian monsters from the past, among them Hitler, Mussolini and Stalin. The Vietnam War is brought in through an ink-and-gouache sketch of Nick Ut's famous 1972 photograph of the 9-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc, running, napalm-soaked and naked, down a road. Mr. Pettibon, who routinely alters found images and quotations, stays faithful to the original in this case, except to insert a misogynistic quotation he attributes to Henry A. Kissinger. And the history keeps coming. Richard M. Nixon, as a five-o'clock-shadowed Savonarola, takes a hit. So does a chatty, cheerful Ronald Reagan. And George W. Bush, preening in Top Gun gear and justifying his war to no one in particular. And the war gets full-color special-effects treatment in scenes of flaming trucks, burning bodies and flag-draped coffins stacked up like Christmas gifts. The mordant but distanced wit characteristic of this artist breaks down here, and in the images that round out the section: a melting Lady Liberty, a lynching, a mushroom cloud, a dollar sign, and a sheet of paper with the block-lettered phrase ""Paint the All Unutterable."" I take the phrase as an instruction, a self-command. And in his political work, Mr. Pettibon has always followed it. I hope he continues to. When the governing model of democratic expression means shouting down and silencing the opposition, we're going to need all the critical words -- and images -- at high volume that we can get.","A career retrospective with more than 800 annotated drawings, most in pen and ink, and paintings fills three floors and the lobby of the New Museum.",40d3534c-9cd8-51d8-b79f-6d3909eb7c2c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/10/arts/10PETTIBON3/10PETTIBON3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fb0fd8a8c513750950b6086d15f1af61250af1d5351474db8ec620be343ff824&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""No Title (Do You See ...),"" 2015.",40d3534c-9cd8-51d8-b79f-6d3909eb7c2c,N24News/imgs/40d3534c-9cd8-51d8-b79f-6d3909eb7c2c.jpg,14

Opinion,Why Southern Democrats Saved Biden,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/05/opinion/joe-biden-southern-democrats.html,"At the Lorraine Motel in Memphis, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968, things look much as they did a half-century ago. The site is now home to the National Civil Rights Museum, a remarkable collection that includes a replica of a firebombed bus ridden by the Freedom Riders as they traveled through the South protesting segregation in 1961. Inside the museum the other day, a woman sat down beside me and wiped away tears. ""I'm sorry,"" she said. ""What gets me is, after all this time, look what's happening right now.""

Representative Jim Clyburn of South Carolina explained this in visceral terms when he announced his support for Joe Biden late last month, an endorsement that began with Mr. Clyburn, 79, talking about the first time he was arrested protesting for civil rights decades ago. ""When I sat in jail that day, I wondered whether we were doing the right thing, but I was never fearful for the future,"" he said. ""As I stand before you today I am fearful of the future of this country. I'm fearful for my daughters and their futures, and their children, and their children's futures."" Mr. Clyburn said he was sure Mr. Biden was the right choice. ""I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,"" he said. Three days later, Mr. Biden won a convincing victory in the South Carolina primary, launching him into his Super Tuesday triumph and the front-runner status he enjoys today.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" My friends in New York, many of them Elizabeth Warren or Bernie Sanders supporters who see Mr. Biden as deeply uninspiring, were mystified. But after traveling through the South this past week, I began to understand. Through Southern eyes, this election is not about policy or personality. It's about something much darker. Not long ago, these Americans lived under violent, anti-democratic governments. Now, many there say they see in President Trump and his supporters the same hostility and zeal for authoritarianism that marked life under Jim Crow.

For those who lived through the trauma of racial terrorism and segregation, or grew up in its long shadow, this history haunts the campaign trail. And Mr. Trump has summoned old ghosts. ""People are prideful of being racist again,"" said Bobby Caradine, 47, who is black and has lived in Memphis all his life. ""It's right back out in the open."" In Tennessee and Alabama, in Arkansas and Oklahoma and Mississippi, Democrats, black and white, told me they were united by a single, urgent goal: defeating Mr. Trump this November, with any candidate, and at any cost. ""There's three things I want to happen,"" Angela Watson, a 60-year-old black Democrat from Oklahoma City, told me at a campaign event there this week. ""One, beat Trump. Two, beat Trump. And three, beat Trump."" They were deeply skeptical that a democratic socialist like Mr. Sanders could unseat Mr. Trump. They liked Ms. Warren, but, burned by Hillary Clinton's loss, were worried that too many of their fellow Americans wouldn't vote for a woman. Joe Biden is no Barack Obama. But he was somebody they knew. ""He was with Obama for all those years,"" Mr. Caradine said. ""People are comfortable with him."" Faced with the prospect of their children losing the basic rights they won over many generations, these voters, as the old Chicago political saw goes, don't want nobody that nobody sent. Mr. Biden understands this. ""If the Democrats want a nominee who's a Democrat -- a lifelong Democrat! a proud Democrat! an Obama-Biden Democrat! -- then join us!"" he told voters in South Carolina in his victory speech.

Health,Coronavirus Threatens Americans With Underlying Conditions,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/12/health/coronavirus-midlife-conditions.html,"The new coronavirus is a serious threat to the elderly, as federal officials have been at pains to note recently. But they have stepped gingerly around advice for another group of Americans also at special risk from the infection: those with chronic health conditions. It is not a small group. An estimated 60 percent of all Americans have at least one chronic health condition, and 40 percent have more than one. (The figures include the elderly.) Heart disease, cancer, diabetes -- all of these can exacerbate a coronavirus infection, studies show, increasing the odds of severe disease and death. Federal health officials have urged those in their 80s and older to sharply curtail their activities to reduce exposing themselves to infection. But beyond general advice to wash hands frequently and to avoid crowds, officials have said little about those who are younger and cope with chronic illnesses. Now some experts are encouraging this broader swath of the population to take immediate action to protect themselves.

""All you folks older than 60 and those who have underlying illnesses, you ought to do personal mitigation starting now,"" said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. The risk of dying if one contracts the infection begins to rise at a younger age than federal officials have acknowledged, suggesting the coronavirus may cut deeply into the fabric of a society in which many older adults continue to lead active, engaged lives. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In the largest study to date, conducted in China, the greatest risk of death from Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, was found among patients in their 80s or older, 15 percent of whom died. But while just 1.3 percent of patients in their 50s died, the death rate rose with each additional decade of life, increasing to 3.6 percent for patients in their 60s and to 8 percent for patients in their 70s. The virus has killed younger people: Dr. Li Wenliang, the physician who died after raising the alarm about the mysterious new illness, was only 34. But children have been affected in very small numbers, and younger adults have displayed greater resilience. The chronic health conditions that cause complications following infection with the coronavirus are certainly more common in older people. But they are also commonly found in Americans under 65.

High blood pressure affects nearly one in three adults in the United States, including one-third of adults in their 40s and 50s. More than one in 10 adults have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, including 17 percent of adults aged 45 to 64. At least 16 million Americans struggle with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A study of 1,590 patients, also in China, found that people infected with the coronavirus who were already coping with a chronic condition were 1.8 times more likely to have a ""poor outcome,"" such as being put on a ventilator or dying, than those with no underlying conditions. But those with two chronic conditions were at 2.6 greater risk, compared to individuals with none. Nearly 20 percent of the patients who had at least one chronic condition had a poor outcome, compared with 4.5 percent of those without any chronic ailments, the study found. What to do Dr. Schaffner and other public health experts outlined a series of steps individuals can take to minimize their risk of exposure. ""It's imperative that the population understand that now is the time to get serious about avoiding group events, and to become a bit of a hermit,"" Dr. Schaffner said. ""If I'm older, and have underlying illnesses, then I'm the kind of person that this virus makes more seriously and even gravely ill."" Among the recommendations were: refraining from recreational group activities and face-to-face work meetings. Canceling travel. Staying home from religious services and other social and celebratory events -- even family get-togethers -- that bring together large groups.

Go shopping at off hours, when stores are less frequented, Dr. Schaffner suggested. Watch the game on TV, not live. And no hugging.

* How to get a coronavirus booster shot in New York City.
* Several moves by the U.S. over the last week aim to shift the course of the pandemic. ""I'm not trying to put everyone in a plastic enclosure, but to reduce the risk,"" Dr. Schaffner said. ""And every little thing you can do to reduce the risk helps."" Smoking An estimated 34 million Americans smoke, and 16 million live with a disease caused by smoking. Covid-19 is a respiratory ailment. Longtime smokers with damaged lungs will be more vulnerable and should quit now, said Marc Lipsitch, an epidemiologist at Harvard University. Diabetes If you have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, exercising very strict control over blood sugar levels can help boost immunity, said Dr. Sandra Weber, president of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists. ""We know that if you do not have good glucose control, you're at high risk for infection, including viruses and presumably this one as well,"" Dr. Weber said.

People with Type 1 diabetes are more likely to have severe disease if they become infected. When they experience viral symptoms like nausea, diarrhea and vomiting, they are more likely to develop a serious complication called life-threatening ketoacidosis. Lung disease Dr. Albert Rizzo, chief medical officer of the American Lung Association, urged patients with chronic lung conditions like asthma or C.O.P.D. to talk to their doctors -- by phone -- and to ""think twice"" about going anywhere that might expose them to the virus. Heart disease A respiratory illness like Covid-19 is risky for anyone who has heart disease, because it increases metabolic demand, forcing the heart to work harder to pump blood, said Orly Vardeny, who studies influenza and heart disease at the University of Minnesota. ""That extra stress leads to worsening of their underlying heart disease,"" she said. ""It's not going to be limited to fever, cough, pneumonia -- it's also going to affect whatever their underlying condition is and make it worse."" Immunocompromised People with compromised immune systems are especially vulnerable to respiratory infections. That group includes those who have autoimmune disorders such as lupus and arthritis, those who have had organ transplants, patients undergoing chemotherapy and other cancer treatments, and anyone who is taking steroids as treatment. People with H.I.V. are not on the list as yet, however. With powerful antiretroviral drugs, many now have immune systems strong enough to stave off infections, said Dr. Monica Gandhi, an infectious disease expert at the University of California, San Francisco.

At least 1,400 Americans are known to have the coronavirus, though the real prevalence in the United States is unknown, as testing has been scarce. At least 38 have died of the infection. ""People should understand they need to take control of their own life,"" Dr. Osterholm said. ""You can't assume anymore that people are not capable of infecting you. In many cases they won't even know they're infected."" Those who are older or who have chronic health conditions ""have to kind of assume the rest of the world is a coronavirus soup,"" he added. ""If I don't want to end up swimming in that bowl, I need to find another place on the plate.""","Those with chronic health problems are more likely to develop severe illnesses and to die, research shows.",86bb3c6e-4154-5b70-a952-842dcb6bb63e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/12/science/12VIRUS-CONDITIONS1/12VIRUS-CONDITIONS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=518d7f13e05fb82e19abda9694fe13c281dbae67fb4221e9a1efcda4d9ef5c82&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A patient was put into an ambulance at the Life Care Center in Kirkland, Wash., this week.",86bb3c6e-4154-5b70-a952-842dcb6bb63e,N24News/imgs/86bb3c6e-4154-5b70-a952-842dcb6bb63e.jpg,1

Technology,Google Hearing to Preview Democrats' Strategy on Big Tech,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/07/technology/google-hearing-to-preview-democrats-strategy-on-big-tech.html,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats and Google executives worked arm in arm for years, particularly during the Obama administration. But when Sundar Pichai, Google's chief executive, testifies before Congress on Tuesday, some of the toughest questioning is likely to come from Democrats. The hearing will provide an early glimpse of how Democrats plan to approach Silicon Valley giants in the coming year as they assume control of the House of Representatives. And the testimony from Mr. Pichai, who is appearing before lawmakers after initially resisting, may provide clues about how he and the company will approach them. Democratic lawmakers, angry about Russian misinformation online during the 2016 campaign and concerned about the expanding influence of tech's biggest companies, are expected to target the industry in the next Congress. Some have already raised concerns about potential antitrust and privacy violations, showing more willingness than Republicans to regulate an industry viewed as an engine of economic growth. Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a Democrat, and Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, have warned that Amazon and other tech giants aren't paying fair wages. Two other Democrats, Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, have called for privacy and online ad legislation, saying big tech companies can't be trusted to regulate themselves.

Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island who sits on the House Judiciary Committee, said, ""We need to restore competition and protect our rights online."" He added: ""The promise of an open internet is fundamentally threatened by the ability of a few powerful gatekeepers to bully competitors, cripple innovation and exploit consumers. This must be a top priority going forward."" The concerns are aimed broadly across the tech industry. On Tuesday, however, they will focus on Google, as Mr. Pichai will be alone in testifying before the House Judiciary Committee. Over the past year, Google has avoided the intense scrutiny heaped upon internet rivals, even as it grappled with questions about privacy and misinformation on services like YouTube. But the company upset lawmakers when it decided not to send a top executive to testify alongside leaders of Facebook and Twitter at a hearing a few months ago. Lawmakers left an empty seat for Google with a name tag for Larry Page, chief executive of Alphabet, Google's parent company. To tamp down criticism, Mr. Pichai traveled to Washington in September, meeting with lawmakers from both parties. He agreed at the time to testify later in the year. The hearing, ""Transparency & Accountability: Examining Google and Its Data Collection, Use and Filtering Practices,"" is expected to cover a wide array of topics, led by Republican allegations of anti-conservative biases in how search results are surfaced. A Google spokesman declined to comment about the hearing.

Republicans have accused Google, Twitter and Facebook of secretly placing conservative voices lower in news feed and search rankings. President Trump and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, have joined the chorus of critics, saying that the liberal views of Silicon Valley leaders and employees have led them to program their services to limit conservative voices.

""Recent reports suggest Google might not be wielding its vast power impartially,"" said the House Republican leader, Kevin McCarthy of California, who called on Mr. Pichai to meet with members during his September visit. ""Its business practices may have been affected by political bias."" Some Democrats warned that Republicans could focus too much on the accusations of anti-conservative bias, arguing that it would distract from more pressing issues like misinformation and the handling of user data. ""The public has voiced grave concerns about privacy, discrimination, lack of diversity and incivility online,"" said Representative Frank Pallone Jr. of New Jersey, the top Democrat on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. ""Unfortunately, House Republicans are instead choosing to use their final days in the majority to peddle conspiracy theories about conservative bias."" The prospect of legislation to rein in tech remains slim, because Republicans still control the Senate and have shown no signs of wanting to add regulations. But the harsh criticism from Democrats has put the companies in a defensive crouch. ""The internet companies' blue wall of protection in Washington seems to be crumbling,"" said Paul Gallant, an analyst at the research firm Cowen & Company. ""Democrats now see political gain in taking on tech."" On Thursday, Mr. Pichai participated in a White House business round table that included Microsoft's chief executive, Satya Nadella; Oracle's co-chief executive Safra Catz; Qualcomm's chief executive, Steve Mollenkopf; and others.

While Mr. Trump made a brief appearance, his daughter and special adviser, Ivanka Trump, represented the White House. She was joined by some administration tech advisers. The topics of discussion included artificial intelligence, quantum computing and next-generation 5G wireless networks. At the hearing, Mr. Pichai is likely to get questions about Google's search results, which company executives have repeatedly denied are altered for political purposes. He will probably also get questions about privacy and how the company handles cases of sexual harassment. Last month, more than 20,000 employees around the world walked out in protest of the company's handling of sexual harassment and discrimination claims. The company gave in to one of the protest organizers' demands to end the practice of forced arbitration for employees bringing sexual harassment claims. Democratic and Republican lawmakers are also expected to press him on Google's possible plans for re-entering China, a market the company left in 2010 over concerns about censorship and government hacking. Google has more recently been working on a search engine that adheres to the Chinese government's censorship requirements. The project, code-named Dragonfly, has upset employees who feel Google would be playing a part in silencing dissidents and spreading government propaganda. Mr. Pichai has said that Google is merely investigating the idea and that it has not made a decision to move forward with a search product for China. Mr. Pichai has kept a relatively low profile since becoming Google's chief in 2015. A soft-spoken engineer who grew up in Chennai, India, he worked his way up the ranks at the company and is seen as more at home dealing with products and technology than with policy and politics. But like other technology chief executives facing questions about the societal impact of their products and the policies of their companies, Mr. Pichai is being forced to take a more active role in Washington. Mr. Pichai's political donations also mirror Google's attempts to foster better relationships with Republicans. After donating mostly to Democratic candidates since 2008, Mr. Pichai, who is one of the highest-paid executives in Silicon Valley, adopted a more bipartisan approach to his donations. In 2017, he donated nearly $34,000 to both the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.","Sundar Pichai, the chief executive of Google, will testify before Congress on Tuesday.

Books,'Generation Revolution': Why Youth Was Not Enough in Egypt,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/06/books/review/generation-revolution-rachel-aspden.html,"GENERATION REVOLUTION 

On the Front Line Between Tradition and Change in the Middle East 

By Rachel Aspden

262 pp. Other Press. $24.95. After January 2011, Tahrir Square became a byword for hope, defiance and the unpredictability of history. The Egyptian people's unexpected revolt baffled political scientists and other experts. Equally puzzling was the alacrity with which so many of the same Egyptians welcomed a new strongman a few short years later. Egypt's volte-face forces important questions about what kind of change is possible in the Arab world, and more universally, about the indiscriminate and violent nature of both revolutionary and authoritarian politics. Why were so many Egyptians willing to risk everything in 2011, and why, just two years later in July 2013, were so many willing to make another devil's bargain with a despot? ""Generation Revolution"" is a whodunit that seeks to resolve these twin mysteries of geopolitics and human nature. Its author, Rachel Aspden, first moved to Egypt from England in 2003, diving into a culture that she clearly loved on first sight. She studied the language, worked as a journalist and tried her best to understand the worldview of her fellow 20-somethings. Through her long-running friendships Aspden is able to see the frustrations that have driven events in Egypt. The life stories of her characters come into focus long before Tahrir Square in 2011. In this way, Aspden does important work establishing context for Egypt's stifling period of decay, and the improbable revolution and authoritarian backlash that followed. This is a chronicle of politics by other means.

Aspden clearly loves her characters, but she unflinchingly recounts their flaws too. One of the most surprising is Amal, a woman who breaks all taboos to leave her family and village to live on her own in Cairo. Amal finds that political activists and male peers aren't interested in her kind of struggle for freedom. Her story exposes the sordid mechanics of control and the individual cost of rebellion. At one point Amal, who is Muslim, receives help from a Christian church congregation and is detained by authorities, who suspect her of converting. Back in her village, her family locks her up to stop her from making an independent career as a teacher. She manages to run away and assuages her relatives by sharing some of the money she earns. Ultimately, she marries a foreigner and prepares to emigrate. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Other young Egyptians invite Aspden to meetings of ""Life Makers,"" a self-improvement group founded by a charismatic Islamic televangelist. They are touchingly earnest and ambitious, perplexed by their secular peers but open-minded enough to nurture friendships with non-Muslims like Aspden. Still, most of Aspden's friends are willing to entertain change only in limited areas, like the man who sleeps around in a coastal resort but hopes to marry a virgin. She presents the sometimes distasteful choices of her characters with empathy. Mazen, a wealthy Muslim secularist with some enlightened ideas, unexpectedly oozes bigotry and intolerance for Christians. Aspden's reporting is always fascinating, if not always artfully or lyrically delivered. She cheerfully and honestly confronts her own outsider status and newcomer's naivete (as when she enjoys a respite from Cairo's endemic sexual harassment at a cafe that turns out to be a rendezvous spot for prostitutes). Yet her prose can also be frustratingly chatty. In order to profile a wide cross-section of Egyptians over an extended period of time, Aspden has sacrificed depth and focus. Some characters flit in and out, disappearing for years on end. In her tableau, Tahrir Square is but a single inflection point in a long history of national atrophy (the 18 days of the revolt are awkwardly inserted mid-narrative in dated journal-entry format). It's nice putting the uprising in context, but there's not quite enough of it. ""Generation Revolution"" is at its strongest when describing the thicket of its characters' personal struggles -- with faith, family, friendships and sex. The author introduces us to conversations about existential subjects that reveal character, like Islam, virginity and romantic dreams about marriage. For instance, we catch a rare if fleeting glimpse of atheism, a crime in Egypt, in the person of the young doctor Abu el-Hassan, a critical thinker who begins as a religious fundamentalist and ends up rejecting religion.

Aspden's Egyptians are evolving people trying to balance faith, family, ambition and personal happiness against the broader imperatives of authoritarian leaders (at home, in the mosque or church, in the government and military). A diet of hypernationalism, propaganda about foreign conspirators and security paranoia imposes limits even on freethinkers, who often end up mirroring official intolerance in their own lives. One of the saddest elements of the July 2013 coup that abruptly ended Egypt's experiment with democracy and civilian rule was the popular acclaim that ushered Abdel Fattah el-Sisi from army intelligence to the presidency. A great swath of the public was actively complicit in the new dictatorship that killed the revolution it had unleashed in the first place. Aspden brings to her reporting enough insight to make sense of the public's conflicting attitudes, and enough critical distance to acknowledge how Egyptians contributed to their country's sad fate. ""Generation Revolution"" is billed as a book about youth, or, as the subtitle puts it, the ""front line between tradition and change in the Middle East."" In Aspden's telling, the young, not yet ground into submission, have posed the greatest challenge to Egypt's intolerable yet adaptive state. But the young can sustain resistance for only so long. The Tahrir Generation of 2011, she writes, may already be over the hill, though a new crop of restive Egyptians are reaching a boiling point, and they may not submit in the same way their grandparents did when the first military strongman took power in 1952. Nonetheless, Aspden notes, an empowered populace armed with education, modern communication tools and high expectations can repeatedly be dominated by an equally modern coercive state. Her conclusion is dispiriting, but she backs it with evidence. Youth alone, it seems, does not suffice to change tradition. As Aspden demonstrates, all the well-intended characters in her book planted some of the seeds of their own downfall. Amal joined a popular protest movement unaware that it was being manipulated by intelligence agencies to bring Sisi to power. Islamists may have been willing to die opposing the coup, but they were uninterested in the fate of secular dissidents or democracy in general. Part-time revolutionaries mindlessly parroted state propaganda or the bigotry of Egypt's religious establishment. Almost none were willing to defy their families for very long. ""Generation Revolution"" is an excellent social history of Egypt's persistent pathologies, as well as a universal story about the difficulty of changing deeply ingrained societal attitudes. The ambivalent Egyptians who struggle between radical modern aspirations and conservative community mores bear a more than passing resemblance to their American counterparts trying to reconcile Donald Trump's vision for their country with Barack Obama's, and no explanation for any of this can be complete without the kind of social history Aspden provides. The cumulative choices of millions, whether in protest, in voting or in docile compliance, are the indispensable ingredient. So what did happen to Egypt's revolution? Aspden, like most of its chroniclers, was rooting for it to succeed. Yet it failed, she says, not only because the police state adapted so efficaciously but also because the people who sparked the revolt ultimately remained faithful to too many reactionary ideas. The character studies of ""Generation Revolution"" point to a single conclusion: Revolutionary Egyptians sought radical change only in the narrow lane of their relationship to the government and police. They did not reject the profoundly conservative mores of family, village, neighborhood and religious hierarchy, whose webs of control emerged relatively unscathed from the revolutionary period. Lasting change, however, cannot occur in isolation. Egyptians have proven remarkably inventive and good-humored at finding ways to circumvent or adapt to the state's abuses, but less so at finding ways to stop them.","""Generation Revolution"" by Rachel Aspden shows that the young in Egypt are improbably looking forward and backward at the same time.",5934c895-e6f2-5d54-9945-3c0bb2c48758,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/12/books/review/12Cambanis/12Cambanis-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fd15a12f66d164772270344dea1bcdf08198e5b89f6ddf658003dd9e465f09ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Posting video from Tahrir Square, February 2011.",5934c895-e6f2-5d54-9945-3c0bb2c48758,N24News/imgs/5934c895-e6f2-5d54-9945-3c0bb2c48758.jpg,13
Opinion,When F. Murray Abraham and Ruth Bader Ginsburg Met in Venice,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/opinion/letters/ruth-bader-ginsburg-f-murray-abraham.html,"Ruth Bader Ginsburg and I shared a gondola in Venice during the 500th anniversary of the Ghetto in 2016. I was filming the ""Merchant of Venice"" segment of the PBS ""Shakespeare Uncovered"" series, and when her boat broke down, I invited her to share mine.

She stood no higher than my shoulder, which startled me, and even now in my memory, our first meeting is one of surprise, because her quiet, assured stillness projected something much bigger and stopped me cold. I imagine it affected everyone the same way; it was calming. Her bodyguard was just about twice her size, and my sense of him was that he was so proud to be her protector.

She and I sat next to each other in the ride to her hotel, and I invited her to act with me in the trial scene from ""The Merchant of Venice""; I'd been scheduled to appear in a mock-trial appeal of Shylock's verdict. She instantly agreed, and it's on tape somewhere.

They then retired to chambers for half an hour, and when they returned, Chief Justice Ginsburg found for Shylock on several grounds, one of which was that counsel for the defense, Portia, did not have a license to practice law, but also that Shylock, if he had known of the deadly consequences of his actions, would have never insisted on the pound of flesh.",The actor recalls a chance encounter that led to a memorable performance.

Health,Trump's Antibody 'Cure' Will Be in Short Supply,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/health/covid-antibody-regeneron.html,"Nearly two weeks ago, President Trump told Americans that they would soon be getting an antibody treatment that he had promoted, without evidence, as a ""cure"" for the coronavirus. This weekend, as the country braced for another major wave of coronavirus infections, Mr. Trump's health secretary promised such therapies were just around the corner. But these statements are misleading, at best. Even if the drugs are proven to work -- still a big if -- there's little chance that they will soon be widely available. A smooth distribution of the antibody treatments will be dependent on the very same factors that have so far bedeviled the country's response to Covid-19: fast and plentiful testing, coordination between state and federal officials, and equitable access to health care. Supply will be extremely limited at first, even though the pool of patients who might benefit is vast, raising messy questions about who should be first in line for treatment. The drugs are believed to work best in people who have recently been infected and are not yet very sick. ""It is just a setup for everything challenging about the pandemic that we've had until now, which is confusion, inequity, delays, reliance on testing,"" said Dr. Walid Gellad, the director of the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh. The therapies are promising, he said, but with ""everything that's gone wrong, it's going to accentuate the problems.""

Roughly 60,000 Americans are testing positive for the coronavirus every day, yet the company that provided the president's antibody treatment, Regeneron, has said it will have only 50,000 doses initially. Eli Lilly, which is developing a similar product, has said it will have 100,000 doses at first. Regeneron will eventually have 300,000 doses, and Eli Lilly will have up to one million before the end of the year. Both companies have applied to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency authorization of their products. Administering the treatment is not as simple as handing out a bottle of pills. The therapies are given intravenously, requiring an infected person to visit a medical clinic or a hospital. That's assuming that the distribution will go smoothly. Officials with Operation Warp Speed, the government effort to speed treatments and vaccines to market, recently told reporters that the federal government would hand over to states the job of allocating the initial doses of Regeneron drugs. But those state agencies are overwhelmed from handling the current influx of new cases, as well as from planning for the distribution of coronavirus tests and future vaccines, and have not yet made detailed plans for deciding how to allocate the antibody treatments to hospitals and clinics.

Even some company executives have acknowledged that the country may not yet be up to the challenge. Dr. George Yancopoulos, the president and chief scientific officer of Regeneron, said in a recent call with investors and reporters that communities would need to have rapid testing and contact tracing in place to identify the best candidates for the treatments. ""We, as a society, are literally trying to fly a plane while we're trying to build it here,"" he said. Early data about the therapies have shown that they help clear the virus in people who have recently been infected, and that they may help prevent hospitalizations. In another positive sign, the F.D.A. recently approved an Ebola treatment made by Regeneron that uses the same technology. Eli Lilly and Regeneron have said the antibodies might be used both as a treatment for those who are sick and to prevent infection in people who have been exposed. The treatments could serve as a bridge to a vaccine, protecting high-risk groups like nursing home residents and the workers who care for them. Still, it's unclear when the F.D.A. will give a green light to emergency authorization. Regulators must review a mountain of data and decide which groups might benefit the most. Last week, a government-backed clinical trial testing the Eli Lilly therapy in hospitalized patients was paused for unspecified safety reasons, and it will not restart until at least Oct. 26. If an emergency authorization does come through, Regeneron's first 300,000 doses will go to the federal government, thanks to an advance purchase agreement. Those initial doses will be free of charge to Americans. Eli Lilly has not made a similar deal, but at a recent news conference, the chief executive, David A. Ricks, said ""conversations are ongoing"" with Operation Warp Speed.

Dr. Douglas B. White, a medical ethicist and professor of critical care medicine at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, said he hoped hospitals would apply the lessons they had learned when another experimental Covid-19 drug, remdesivir, was initially scarce. Then, too, the federal government asked states to take responsibility for how the drug was allocated.
* Who should get a booster shot? It depends, Dr. Scott Gottlieb says. Dr. White wrote guidelines that were adopted by Pennsylvania that recommended giving priority to people from economically disadvantaged communities, who are at higher risk of dying from Covid-19. The same rules should apply to the antibody treatments, if they are in short supply, he said. ""There needs to be clear guidelines, and there needs to be efforts to mitigate the inequitable outcomes across groups in society,"" he said. Dr. Plescia, of the state health officials group, said he believed that most states had worked out the kinks that occurred with remdesivir. Now, he said, ""I think there's a distribution chain in place that could be adapted to this."" The antibody treatment will present new challenges. Eli Lilly has said that people who are older and obese are at higher risk for poor outcomes from Covid-19 and will benefit the most from the treatment. Regeneron has said that people whose bodies are not producing antibodies appear to be the best candidates.

In early trial data released by Eli Lilly, 5.8 percent of people who received a placebo were hospitalized or visited an emergency room for Covid-19, compared with 0.9 percent of people in the group that received the antibody treatment. Figuring out who will benefit the most is an enormous challenge, because most people will recover on their own. Geoffrey Porges, a pharmaceutical analyst with SVB Leerink, an investment bank, said that means that 100 patients would need to be treated to prevent about five from going to the hospital. ""That's expensive and complicated, and you don't know who the five are that would have gone to the hospital,"" he said.

If the antibody treatments prove effective, they are expected to become more widely available by early next year. Regeneron has said it will be able to produce about 250,000 doses a month in partnership with Roche. Eli Lilly has said it will also be able to ramp up production. Another company, AstraZeneca, is also developing an antibody treatment that is earlier in its development, and it has a deal with the federal government to supply up to 100,000 doses by the end of December. In the meantime, some doctors on the front lines say they are eager for any new tool to keep people out of the hospital. Dr. Manar Alshahrouri is a critical care doctor in Green Bay, Wis., one of many cities in the Upper Midwest where infections are surging. The intensive care units at the two hospitals in which he works are nearly full, he said. And there's little to give patients who are newly sick with Covid-19 to prevent them from winding up there. ""We don't have, as of now, anything that is effective,"" Dr. Alshahrouri said. ""We simply do not."" But he cautioned that hope for a miracle cure should not be used as a crutch, and it should not replace preventive measures like wearing masks. Keeping people out of the hospital is ""a great endpoint for us as clinicians, but it is not a substitute for far more effective measures,"" he said. ""If you have a flood in your basement, the answer is not more towels. The answer is to turn off the water.""","All the weak points of American health care — testing delays, communication breakdowns, inequity — are working against this potential treatment.",af78a9c9-bbd3-541d-b41f-f9af697432fe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/20/science/20VIRUS-REGENERON1/20VIRUS-REGENERON1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5bb9294c10bd3cda6020577d3ffbb3c9da7117e3c23010a7441f280740aea260&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An antibody trial site for Regeneron and Eli Lilly treatments in Mesa, Ariz.",af78a9c9-bbd3-541d-b41f-f9af697432fe,N24News/imgs/af78a9c9-bbd3-541d-b41f-f9af697432fe.jpg,1
Opinion,"Bernie Sanders, Front-Runner",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/opinion/bernie-sanders-new-hampshire.html,"This article is part of David Leonhardt's newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it each weekday. Bernie Sanders is now the front-runner for the Democratic nomination. He won the New Hampshire primary last night, after virtually tying with Pete Buttigieg in Iowa last week. In some ways, Sanders looks like a strong front-runner. As Chris Hayes of MSNBC said last night, Sanders is winning races; he has raised a lot of money; and he has more of a multiracial coalition than Buttigieg or Amy Klobuchar, who finished second and third in New Hampshire. In other ways, though, Sanders looks vulnerable. He only barely won New Hampshire -- despite having crushed Hillary Clinton there four years ago and despite New Hampshire being next door to his home state of Vermont. Most Democratic voters remain wary of Sanders.

One of Sanders's biggest advantages at this point is that no clear moderate alternative has emerged. The alternatives are splitting votes. Buttigieg and Klobuchar both see themselves as the strongest alternative, as does Michael Bloomberg, who is now faring pretty well in national polls of Democrats.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" Josh Kraushaar of National Journal predicts that the race has a long way to go. In 2016, the Republican Party awarded delegates on a winner-take-all basis, which meant that Trump could build a solid lead even with narrow primary wins. The Democratic Party awards delegates proportionately. ""The most likely long-term outcome is a muddle,"" Kraushaar writes, ""with Sanders slowly racking up more delegates than his rivals but well short of the majority necessary to win the party's nomination."" Bill Barr's Justice Department: After Watergate, the Department of Justice created a new ethos that was meant to keep future presidents from abusing their power. That ethos would ensure that the department was the most independent, least partisan agency of the executive branch. Presidents would continue to set policy, obviously, but they would not influence specific investigations. They would not use the law to protect themselves and their allies or to punish their political rivals. ""Our law is not an instrument of partisan purpose,"" said Edward Levi, the first post-Watergate attorney general, appointed by President Gerald Ford. Griffin Bell, who succeeded Levi and was appointed by President Jimmy Carter, described the Justice Department as ""a neutral zone in the government, because the law has to be neutral."" President Trump has never hidden his disagreement with this ethos. He believes that the Justice Department should report to the president and act in his interest, including punishing a president's opponents and protecting his allies.

If you want to understand why Trump became so furious with Jeff Sessions, his first attorney general, it's because Sessions -- for all his conservatism -- essentially believed in the post-Watergate ethos. Trump's current attorney general, William Barr, does not. Barr is with Trump: When presidential power and equal justice come into conflict, power should usually win. Yesterday, political appointees at the Justice Department overruled career prosecutors who had recommended a seven- to nine-year prison sentence for Roger Stone, for trying to sabotage an investigation that threatened Trump. The department did so shortly after Trump had blasted the requested sentence on Twitter. Four prosecutors quickly quit (either the case or their job) in protest. In doing so, they were sacrificing their careers on behalf of a principle that presidents of both parties used to uphold. Elsewhere: Asha Rangappa, former F.B.I. agent: ""I have really tried to have, and encourage others to have, faith in the resiliency of our institutions. But today I just feel so much sadness -- grief, really -- over what is happening. There is a cancer in the White House, and it has spread to the Justice Department."" Harry Litman, a former prosecutor, in The Washington Post: ""It is hard to overstate the irregularity and impropriety of the department's rollback of Stone's sentence. ... As a general matter, the Justice Department and the White House are supposed to communicate only in rare, well-defined instances and almost never about the results of individual cases."" Elizabeth de la Vega, another former prosecutor, noted that the judge in the case, Amy Berman Jackson, could ignore the new Justice Department request and sentence Stone ""as she sees fit.""

Art & Design,"In Seattle, Creating Community by Collecting Art and Artists",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/arts/design/show-us-your-wall-shaun-kardinal.html,"SEATTLE -- Shaun Kardinal, 36, doesn't know where he'd fit another piece of art in his one-bedroom apartment, which is bursting already with more than 100 works. ""Art tends to find the nooks and crannies for things to happen,"" he said. Mr. Kardinal's collection was born of the artistic community he has tapped into since his early days working at a frame shop. The items he pointed out in a visit to his Seattle home chronicle his 18 years there: There's a colored-pencil drawing of him and his cat by Troy Gua; a painting by a neighbor of her bathroom, which is identical to his; and several pieces acquired through trades with artists he has befriended over time. Now he is the lead web developer at Civilization, a design studio, and has made a name for himself as a conceptual artist, especially with his embroidered postcards.

Which was the first piece that made you feel like a collector? The very first piece I got that I felt was real art was this screen print by Yuki Nakamura. She had had some beautiful large installs at the gallery next to the frame shop, then had a show with cheap prints. I ran and got one for $20. How have you found quality work on a limited budget? This portrait, ""Attempted Murder,"" by Chris Crites, was the first piece I ever got from a gallery with a payment plan. It was only $400 or $500, but I paid it off over three or four months. A bunch of these other works were trades. I was working in that frame shop for about five years, and during that time, I made about 50 websites for artists, galleries and arts organizations. There are probably 20 or 25 pieces in the apartment that are traded, either for a website or for a piece of my own work.

How else has building up an artistic community helped you collect? Well, this one, for example, ""Woman, Woman, Woman,"" by Kimberly Trowbridge, I got at her studio sale. She's a dear friend, and she said to name a price and gave it to me for much less than she could have gotten. I think there's an element of being involved in the community that pays dividends in that way. People like to give a deal, especially when it's a friend. This one, called ""Want  Need"" by Graham Downing, was showing at a friend's gallery. I ended up getting that when he put it on Facebook saying nobody had picked it up. I commented with a red dot emoji.

Following artists on Instagram is a great way to keep up. I just got a piece from an auction in Portland. I really wanted a piece by this artist, Joe Rudko. He said on Instagram it was going to be in this auction at Disjecta Contemporary Arts Center, so I wrote and asked if I could do a remote bid. They said, ""Let us know your max bid and someone will raise a paddle for you."" Sure enough, I ended up getting it.

What about for people who are not yet part of an arts community? Where do they start? I feel like there's a little barrier in there, but there's always a way to get in. Get a publication like an arts weekly that tells you where to go. Look for neighborhood art walks. Introduce yourself to the artists, ask them questions. Those artists will want to talk about the work. Those galleries will have a payment plan. The opportunities to wind your way down a path toward an affordable piece are absolutely there. Do you know whether any of the pieces you've bought have increased in value? I don't think of them as investments. I only get things that I love. I do know that that piece, ""Royalties Wanted,"" by Anthony White, would probably go for three or four times what I got it for. This kid is skyrocketing. But when I saw it, I just knew I had to have it, and I had to get a payment plan to get it. But what I'd really like to do is make all this a permanent collection. I would love to have all this stuff as a snapshot of a generation that I've been here to witness.","Shaun Kardinal has a budget and a home filled with original works.

Science,A Billion-Year-Old Fungus May Hold Clues to Life's Arrival on Land,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/22/science/fungi-fossils-plants.html,"Scientists reported on Wednesday that they have discovered the oldest known fossils of fungi, a finding that may reshape our understanding of how life first arrived on land from the oceans. Fungi are the invisible giants of the natural world, even if most people are only dimly aware of them as toadstools along a hiking trail, or mushrooms sprinkled across a pizza. Scientists have identified about 120,000 species of fungi so far, but estimate there are as many as 3.3 million species in all. By comparison, all living mammals comprise fewer than 6,400 species. The success of fungi results largely from their unique way of feeding. Rather than absorbing sunlight like plants or devouring other organisms like animals, fungi spew out powerful enzymes. These break down surrounding cells or even rock, which the fungi slurp up.

Some of them seemed to have partnered with plants that also left fossils behind in the rocks. Others appeared to have specialized in breaking down dead plant matter. Until now, those fossils have been the oldest clear evidence of fungi. Many scientists considered them a snapshot of the early conquest of land. Fungi and plants came ashore together as ecological partners, it seemed. Together, they transformed barren lands into a soil-carpeted habitat. Recently, though, some researchers have grown dissatisfied with this scenario. By comparing the DNA of different species, scientists have drawn an evolutionary tree of fungi. If the Scottish fossils were among the earliest members of the fungal kingdom, you'd expect that living fungi would share a common ancestor not much before 407 million years. But that's not what the DNA trees tell us. The genes of living fungi indicate that their common ancestor lived over a billion years ago. Could there be a 600-million-year gap in the fossil record? In recent years, scientists have searched for fungi in rocks older than those in Scotland, and they've found a few microscopic fossils that looked like they might be fungi. But they were too ambiguous to convince many experts. The new fossils came to light during a geological expedition to the barren fringes of the Canadian Arctic. In 2014, Robert Rainbird, a research scientist at the Geological Survey of Canada, noticed black flecks on a piece of shale. He knew that sometimes flecks like these turn out to be microscopic fossils. ""I thought, 'I should grab some of this stuff, because it looks juicy,'"" he said.

Dr. Rainbird sent the material to Emmanuelle Javaux, a paleontologist at the University of Liege in Belgium. She asked Corentin Loron, a graduate student, to analyze them more closely. Mr. Loron put the rocks into an acid bath to strip out the minerals. He ended up with a black paste of organic matter, which he smeared onto slides. When he looked at them under a microscope, he saw hundreds of tiny fossils. The fossils were single-celled organisms. They were much bigger than bacteria, but Mr. Loron couldn't determine exactly what they were. Dr. Rainbird's analysis of the rocks showed that these organisms, whatever they were, had fossilized a billion years ago in an estuary, where a river flowed into a sea. On an expedition in 2017, Dr. Rainbird, Mr. Loron and their colleagues discovered some peculiar fossils in the rocks. They were composed of spore-like spheres, often joined to long filaments that sprouted T-shaped branches -- the kind of shapes found today in fungi.

Mr. Loron used electron microscopes to survey the fine structures, and found that the spheres and filaments had double walls -- another hallmark of fungi. To see what molecules were contained in the fossils, Mr. Loron and his colleagues fired infrared beams at them and measured the light they released. Three fossils produced a pattern that matches that of a substance called chitin. All fungi make chitin to build their tough walls. Only insects and a few other species do the same.

The researchers concluded they had found an ancient fungus, which they named Ourasphaira giraldae. ""This is the first evidence that fungi are a billion years old, even though we've thought they were for a long time,"" said Mary Berbee, a mycologist at the University of British Columbia, who was not involved in the new research. But Dr. Berbee and other experts said they would have more confidence in the findings with more data, especially about the fossils' chemistry. ""I don't have any doubt that they're fossils, and that alone is fascinating,"" said George Cody, an organic geochemist at the Carnegie Institution for Science in Washington. But the infrared results could have been produced by molecules other than chitin, he added. If the Arctic fossils are indeed fungi, it's a mystery how the tendril-sprouting organisms made a living. Today, fungi that sprout tendrils can grow to huge sizes by feeding on vast amounts of plant matter. A single subterranean mat in Oregon is three times larger than Central Park. A billion-year-old fungus would have had no land plants to feed on. The oldest known plant fossils are no more than 470 million years old. ""The fungi were probably colonizing the land before the plants,"" Mr. Loron speculated. The fungi had to be eating something. One possibility: bacteria. Researchers have found signs that crusts of bacteria were growing on land as long as 3.2 billion years ago.

It's also possible that these ancient fungi lived on the bottom of the estuary, perhaps feasting on underwater mats of algae. Land plants evolved from green algae, and so perhaps the estuary habitat was where fungi and the ancestors of plants first formed partnerships. It's possible, Mr. Loron said, such ancient estuaries provided ""the toolbox for everything that's going on land afterward.""",A cache of microscopic fossils from the Arctic hints that fungi evolved long before plants.,3ac259bb-42cc-5ab3-8a68-2b407fdf0ee2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/28/science/22SCI-FUNGI1/22SCI-FUNGI1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=5104ea7936a9f171bfc5a510f94a47c7ccaf38f432ad855e55669c7c3d4700d6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A microfossil of Ourasphaira giraldae, a fungus.

Science,Sometimes Wiping Out Badgers Helped. Sometimes It Didn't. Why?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/09/science/culling-badgers-disease.html,"The badger is chubby but strong, with short legs, a long body and endearingly goofy gait. It has become a cultural icon to children who grew up reading ""The Wind in the Willows,"" or more recently, ""Harry Potter,"" in which the badger is the symbol of the Hufflepuffs. Once tortured by dogs in a blood sport called badger baiting, it is now a protected species in Britain.

But the beloved creatures also carry bovine tuberculosis, a disease that has killed hundreds of thousands of cows across Britain since at least the 1970s. For that reason, the omnivorous mustelids have been targeted in bloody culls to control the disease's spread.

In some instances the effort worked; in others, it didn't. All along, Britons who love badgers have questioned the effectiveness and necessity of the culls.

In a new study, researchers simulated different badger-culling scenarios, and discovered that culling can help reduce the spread of wildlife disease. But to work, the efforts must fall within a ""Goldilocks zone,"" wherein the number of animals killed, the ground covered and the duration of the cull all must be just right. The study's results, published in Journal of the Royal Society Interface on Tuesday, help explain some of the mystery over the varied effectiveness of the culls, which has driven decades of dispute in Britain. The results also provide a framework for understanding culling efforts to stop the spread of wildlife diseases in other animals, and suggest that on-the-ground realities often make a successful cull unattainable.",Culling wildlife is one way to curb the spread of disease among domestic animals.

Books,7 Takeaways From Mary Trump's Book About Her Uncle Donald,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/08/books/review/mary-trump-book-takeaways.html,"In the prologue of ""Too Much and Never Enough,"" Mary Trump writes: ""The media failed to notice that not one member of Donald's family, apart from his children, his son-in-law and his current wife, said a word in support of him during the entire campaign."" That doesn't mean they had no opinions. The daughter of the president's older brother, Freddy, who died in 1981, now shares some of hers -- not just by airing the family's dirty laundry, but by washing and folding it, too. (Mary Trump is a clinical psychologist whose diagnoses for her uncle are as varied and extensive as the fast food buffet he offered the Clemson Tigers when they visited the White House in 2019.)

[ Read Jennifer Szalai's review of ""Too Much and Never Enough."" ]

Here are seven insights gleaned from reading the first niece.

Nothing Donald Trump said during his campaign deviated from Mary Trump's expectations of him.

""I was reminded of every family meal I'd ever attended during which Donald had talked about all of the women he considered ugly fat slobs or the men, usually more accomplished or powerful, he called losers,"" she writes. ""That kind of casual dehumanization of people was commonplace at the Trump dinner table.""

The author declined an invitation to an election night party in New York City.

Her reason: ""I wouldn't be able to contain my euphoria when Clinton's victory was announced, and I didn't want to be rude."" In the months following her uncle's inauguration, ""the smallest thing -- seeing Donald's face or hearing my own name, both of which happened dozens of times a day -- took me back to the time when my father had withered and died beneath the cruelty and contempt of my grandfather. I had lost him when he was only 42 and I was 16.

Books,Are Ben Marcus's Dark and Disturbing New Stories the Literary Answer to 'Black Mirror'?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/31/books/review/ben-marcus-notes-from-the-fog.html,"'s new collection of stories takes a dark view of society, as well as of love, sex, marriage, parenting, employment, technology and human interaction of any kind. He's an engrossing, poetically surreal writer. He's often woundingly funny. Still, the pages turn more heavily here than they did in his last two books, ""Leaving the Sea"" (2014) and ""The Flame Alphabet"" (2012) -- which, by the way, were not exactly Disney on Ice.

This is not to say that Marcus is wrong about people, or about the creepy ""Black Mirror"" episode that's become our lives. There's a small, raw moment in the beautifully unnerving opening story, ""Cold Little Bird,"" that distills the book's cautionary howl. A 10-year-old named Jonah has made a chilling announcement to his parents: He no longer loves them or requires their oversight and, if they so much as hug him, he'll report them to the school therapist for unwanted touching. Jonah's father, Martin, is terrified -- both for his boy and himself. Like virtually every couple in the book, he and his wife are post-passion and nearly post-verbal. ""You'll die, without affection,"" Martin tells his son. ""I'm not kidding. You will actually dry up and die."" ""Notes From the Fog"" is about people so alienated that they're not so much living together as standing on adjacent ice floes.

There was a time when the words ""dystopian"" and ""futuristic"" were nearly synonyms, but even the most alarming events in Marcus's genre-roaming book seem no more than five minutes from now. In ""The Grow-Light Blues,"" Carl Hirsch's craven employers choose him to test a product that would replace meals with nutrient-infused rays from a laptop. The admiration and gratitude of his co-workers fade quickly and the light that's ""slowly roasting Carl's face"" transforms him into a monster to be pitied, shunned, fired. In ""Precious Precious,"" a cubicle worker named Ida Grieve is prescribed an insane-sounding antidepressant, called Rally, which is nearly impossible to swallow, then sits undigested in her stomach like a bomb waiting to go off: ""Soon it had risen back into her mouth -- it felt like a small insect crawling up her throat -- and she had to take it out and butter it again."" All the while, Ida is visiting her aging parents as their minds decay. When her mother fears that she's talking gibberish, she takes Ida's hand and -- in another tiny exchange that evokes a larger quest for connection -- says urgently, ""I made sense, didn't I? ... I want to. I so want to. You know that, right?""","""Notes From the Fog"" features the author's trademark humor and a vision of society both devastatingly bleak and seemingly plausible.",e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/02/books/review/02Giles1/02Giles1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=146708f2b527730a1bf0fbc30c889127a8097294a617b816995b14c9b07d98bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ben Marcus,e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb,N24News/imgs/e516201b-a702-5a08-96fa-8ae6e1feeafb.jpg,13
Theater,"For Shakespeare & Company's Tina Packer, a Last Romance",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/07/theater/for-shakespeare-companys-tina-packer-a-last-romance.html,"In 1971, Tina Packer, then a classically trained English actress, persuaded the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art to let her direct Shakespeare's ""Measure for Measure."" Then she directed ""The Winter's Tale,"" then ""Hamlet."" Ms. Packer kept going, through comedies and histories, tragedies and romances. On Sunday, her production of ""Cymbeline"" finished its run in Lenox, Mass., at Shakespeare & Company, the troupe she founded in 1978. And with it Ms. Packer, 78, finished her run through the Shakespeare canon, having now directed all 37 plays. (""Two Noble Kinsmen,"" a collaboration with John Fletcher, failed to make the cut. ""I didn't find myself interested in it,"" she said.)

How did you come to direct Shakespeare? Well, I loved being a Shakespeare actor, I was passionate about it, but I was always asking questions about the whole play. Now I would say they were feminist questions. All of my directors were men and they were good men, good directors. But I got frustrated. I started thinking there was something wrong with me. And then I thought, ""No, this is ridiculous, I just have a different perception and I must try and put my perception into action rather than becoming a grumpy actor."" Once I started directing there was no stopping me. When did completing the canon become the goal? I never thought consciously, ""Oh, I'm going to do them all."" But I started noticing a progression in his writing of the women. In the beginning they're either shrews or sweet young things, but by the time he gets to his late plays, he says: ""Guys, you have to go with what the women say. Otherwise we're all lost."" That really made me want to keep going.

Usually the one I'm working on. I think: ""My God, this is brilliant. Why didn't I see how brilliant this was?"" ""Cymbeline"" is a case in point. It is such a deep play, but I couldn't see it on the page. It's about what we can't see, what's unconscious, what's hidden. All the hidden things start coming out in the course of the play and eventually tie up together to make the whole story. Do you feel a sense of completion? What I feel more than anything is a satisfaction about absorbing the whole canon. That doesn't count ""Two Noble Kinsmen"" or ""Edward III"" or ""Cardenio"" or any of those other plays that may or may not be Shakespeare's. ""Cardenio"" I found absolutely irritating. I will bet my bottom dollar that's not Shakespeare. I do love that fragment of ""Thomas More""; that feels so absolutely Shakespeare to me. But none of the others have really attracted me.","With ""Cymbeline,"" the troupe's founder has now directed the canon.",e1adde3e-0df8-5d91-89d1-038c52e33717,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/08/arts/08PACKERALT/08PACKERALT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4d1f17997d6abfaa5cae5f5c8fbea1d9e6177eada18830f6929612852c3392b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tina Packer inside the theater at Shakespeare & Company in Lenox, Mass., where she directed ""Cymbeline.""",e1adde3e-0df8-5d91-89d1-038c52e33717,N24News/imgs/e1adde3e-0df8-5d91-89d1-038c52e33717.jpg,10

Theater,Dominique Morisseau: The First Time I Imagined I Was Pregnant,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/21/theater/dominique-morisseau-the-first-time-i-imagined-i-was-pregnant.html,"Choosing one's words carefully: something every writer must do. This scrutiny can fatigue the people in our lives. ""It ain't that deep, Dominique,"" I've been told by loved ones. But not to my kind of brain. It's all very deep. Growing up, I used to think in ""novel speak."" My mind would narrate my actions as if I were reading my own life. Because I had always wanted to be a writer, I liked the idea that someone would one day read my thoughts and every misunderstanding about me would be vindicated. I was certain that my thoughts were far too deep to be comprehended, and I would someday be persecuted for them. Then it happened. The first time I had to choose my words carefully. Eight years old. Second grade at Bates Academy in Detroit. And somehow in my grand imagination, I thought I was pregnant. Now I had no idea how one got pregnant. But that was inconsequential. I was convinced that it was very real, and that I better do something about it -- fast.

It occurred to me in the middle of a reading lesson in Mrs. Hardamon's class. Typically, I loved this class. Not because Mrs. Hardamon was particularly sweet. She was a tough woman who expected a lot from 7- and 8-year-olds. Talking when you were supposed to be doing your classwork, for instance, could mean you were put in a corner or forced to change your desk, possibly placing you next to your second grade arch enemy. But I loved Mrs. Hardamon's class, because we had lots of free reading time, and I was deeply into mysteries. Encyclopedia Brown and the Choose Your Own Adventure books were my jam. Mrs. Hardamon had us reading beyond our grade level, and rambunctiousness was not tolerated. Second grade was no place for games. On this fateful day, my stomach was hurting something awful. In hindsight, it was probably gas. Or an upset stomach mixed with gas. Whatever the case, my stomach was moving. What in the hell is moving inside of my stomach? OH. MY. GOD. I'm pregnant! This, I thought, is what it must feel like to have a baby moving inside of you. I should say that my mother, at this time, was also pregnant. I had placed my hand on her belly and felt my baby brother moving inside of her numerous times. I figured pregnancy must feel like whatever the hell was moving around in my own stomach. And I immediately started sweating bullets trying to contemplate how I was going to get out of this mess. I couldn't tell anyone. I knew that much. I had never, up to this point, considered how babies were conceived. All I knew was that if I stayed in school, did my homework, finished all of my reading assignments, and obeyed my parents and every other adult in the world, I was not supposed to get pregnant.

So, I raised my hand. In the middle of the reading lesson. Mrs. Hardamon was sitting at the front of the class. The rest of us were following along in our textbooks as Kristalyn read aloud. (Side note: I had a rivalry going on with Kristalyn. During a black history performance, Mrs. Hardamon gave Kristalyn the part I wanted and made me her ""understudy."" I was still not over it.) So when I raised my hand during Kristalyn's turn to read, Mrs. Hardamon gave me the side eye. As if to say, ""Dominique's being a hater again."" She called on me, ""What is it, Dominique?"" ""I need to go to the office. I'm not feeling well."" Mrs. Hardamon was skeptical. Was this an excuse to play in the halls, as one was apt to do when bored with the reading lesson? ""Describe how you're feeling."" OH HELL. This was the moment of truth. Did this woman expect me to tell the entire second grade that I was pregnant? I would be stoned. Branded with the scarlet letter ""P."" And the most stressful thing about it? I had no idea how I got into this situation! You sit down for a reading lesson and poof -- you're preggers. I wanted to scream ""I didn't do it!"" But that almost always meant that you did. So I thought to myself, describe the feeling of pregnancy without actually indicting yourself. Choose your words carefully, sister. ""It feels like..."" I hesitated. ""...something's going to burst from inside of me!"" I waited nervously for her reply. Also, I wasn't sure how long it took for the baby to drop, but my stomach was moving furiously and I might go into labor right on these desks. Mrs. Hardamon got the picture. ""Go! Take the pass."" By the time I got home to my parents, I had been nursed and given Pepto-Bismol and told everything would be O.K. in the morning. I never did tell them I believed I was pregnant. As long as I could get away without exposing myself, I would. My words had spared me social persecution. And fortunately, Pepto seemed to be the cure for young pregnancy. Unfortunately, it wasn't the cure for the 12-year-old foster girl in my neighborhood who I later discovered was really pregnant. By then I was 14 and still just as baffled. I knew I'd never be able to find the words to explain her situation to myself or anyone else. There would be years of neglect and abuse and trauma trapped inside of that tale and it was the sort of mystery that would remain unsolved for generations. I always hoped that somehow the right words would soothe whatever went unhealed in her world and in my own. And that someday I would discover a language to defy any limitations, for myself, for the people in my neighborhood, and for all the second graders out there in need of magic words to get them out of the deepest troubles. It is the ongoing quest of my writing career.","""Now I had no idea how one got pregnant.

Technology,"'Release the Kraken,' a catchphrase for unfounded conspiracy theory, trends on Twitter.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/technology/release-the-kraken-a-catchphrase-for-unfounded-conspiracy-theory-trends-on-twitter.html,"A catchphrase winking at an unfounded voter fraud conspiracy in the presidential election trended on Twitter on Tuesday morning as President Trump's allies continued to contest the outcome of the election, which has been called for Joseph R. Biden Jr.

The phrase, ""Release the Kraken,"" appeared on Twitter's trending topics list on Tuesday, collecting nearly 100,000 tweets, pushed mostly by conservatives and far-right internet personalities. It is a catchphrase from the 1981 movie ""The Clash of the Titans,"" but this time it was used to signal an election fraud conspiracy on social media.

The conspiracy stems from a Fox Business Network appearance last Friday by Sidney Powell, a lawyer for the former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn. During an interview with the host Lou Dobbs, Ms. Powell claimed that the president's team had voluminous evidence that it planned to release to overturn election results in key states.

""We are talking about hundreds of thousands of votes,"" Ms. Powell said in the interview. ""President Trump won this election in a landslide.""",The conspiracy stems from a Fox Business appearance last Friday by a lawyer making claims about the election results.,ce4797e9-f151-55d9-9911-691912039378,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/17/us/17distortions-blog-kracken1/17distortions-blog-kracken1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=156d4d9d8500dffe61657eba7ee2c202ffb0730eb5774981769365cb2f4aec61&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sidney Powell, left, a lawyer for the former national security adviser Michael T.

Media,What Made the TV Show 'You' a Hit? Netflix,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/21/business/media/netflix-you-ratings.html,"Throughout the fall, the producer Greg Berlanti was trying to save his cable drama ""You."" The series had premiered on Lifetime in September, but its viewership was virtually nonexistent: roughly 650,000 people were tuning in to each episode of the soapy stalker thriller, starring Penn Badgley. Even Mr. Berlanti, one of the most successful and prolific producers in television thanks to shows like ""Riverdale,"" ""Arrow"" and ""Blindspot,"" conceded in an interview that ""barely anybody watched"" it. He made repeated calls to Lifetime executives, asking for patience and making his case for a second season. It wasn't enough. In early December, Lifetime announced it was finished with ""You."" But right after Christmas, something happened. ""You"" started lighting up social media. People were searching for it online. Entertainment sites like The Ringer were writing about the show. What changed? It began streaming on Netflix. Mr. Berlanti heard from family and friends about how much they were enjoying his new show, ignoring the fact that it had debuted months earlier.

""It's very often in direct proportion to how young they are,"" he said. ""The younger they are, the more they discuss the show as though it had never existed before Dec. 26."" [Read The New York Times review of ""You.""] Last week, Netflix declared ""You"" had drawn the sort of audience to make it a ""huge hit."" The streaming service said that ""You"" was on track to be watched by 40 million households within its first four weeks on the service. The Netflix viewership disclosure -- one of the few times the service has made those numbers public, seven years after it began airing original series -- set off something of an earthquake in the industry. Could the numbers be believed? Could it be possible that a show that premiered on cable television may as well not have existed until Netflix -- which now has 139 million paying subscribers, including 58.5 million in the United States -- came around to stream it? Netflix is already a television network and a movie studio. Was it one step closer to effectively becoming television itself? As Daniel D'Addario, a TV critic for Variety, posited, ""'You' flailing on Lifetime and being treated by the viewing public as a Netflix original is going to be remembered as a major turning point in what will shortly be a contraction of the TV industry.""

And it should be noted that Lifetime is not exactly a ratings wasteland. Its documentary ""Surviving R. Kelly"" has been one of the year's early hits. For the time being, Mr. Berlanti is a believer. ""It went from being one of the least-watched shows I've ever worked on and been most proud of -- and I'm choosing to take Netflix at their word on this -- to being the most-watched show I've ever worked on in 20-something years of being in the business,"" he said. Oh, and Netflix is also making a second season of ""You."" Filming begins next month. Throughout the weekend, rival television executives groused privately that the viewership number Netflix released was virtually meaningless. Netflix explained that each of those 40 million viewers had watched at least 70 percent of one episode. (""You"" has 10 episodes in its first season.)

How that 40 million would translate into a traditional viewership figure is unknown. An average of 12.7 million people have watched this season of ""The Big Bang Theory"" on CBS, but a significantly higher number of people have sampled at least one episode. Few in the television industry would put much stock in such a figure.

* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. When reached for comment, Lifetime referred to an earlier statement it released when it cut ties with ""You,"" saying, ""We wish the cast and crew the best as the series continues on at Netflix."" Mr. Berlanti began developing ""You"" almost four years ago with the producer Sera Gamble. Showtime originally planned to make the series, which is based on a novel by Caroline Kepnes, before passing on it. It then went to Lifetime, which over the summer committed to making a second season.

""You"" centers on a Manhattan bookstore manager named Joe (Mr. Badgley) who becomes obsessed with a young woman who stops by his shop. He plumbs her social media channels. He follows her home. He begins reading her text messages. The occasionally hilarious series, which examines internet privacy and youth culture, was warmly received by critics when it debuted in September. The New Yorker called it ""a scary, delicious snack of a show."" What it could not find was an audience on cable. On the days it aired, it had trouble gaining bigger ratings than the 7 a.m. edition of ""SportsCenter."" Months before the series premiered, Netflix signed on to be the streaming partner of the series. Bela Bajaria, a vice president of content for Netflix who scooped up the streaming rights, had seen success with ""Riverdale,"" another of Mr. Berlanti's series. In its second season, after ""Riverdale"" began streaming on Netflix, its viewership on the CW shot up 42 percent. Netflix has had that effect on series before, including AMC's Emmy-winning drama ""Breaking Bad,"" which saw increased viewership totals after it began streaming. Ms. Bajaria was enthusiastic about ""You"" from the moment she read the script. ""We really felt this hit a sweet spot for our audience, and we felt that our members would love the show,"" she said. ""I was hoping it would be big."" By the time Lifetime decided to renege on its second season commitment in early December, Netflix said it would make a second season even though the series had not started streaming yet. Ms. Bajaria's confidence in the show was well rewarded. She pored over the viewership numbers between Christmas and New Year's Day and saw Netflix had a hit on its hands immediately after it began streaming.","The show drew virtually no audience when it premiered on Lifetime in September.

Books,Rachel Cusk Said She Was Done With Autobiography. These Essays Suggest Otherwise.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/17/books/review/coventry-essays-rachel-cusk.html,"Despite her return to autobiography, the authorial mask is not completely removed, and the essays are stronger for it. The voice is more expansive than in her memoirs, imbued with an authority that is all the more powerful because it is diffuse and flexible, aware of its limited perspective and willing to be measured against those of others. Cusk occasionally cedes the narrative to long anecdotes relayed by friends and acquaintances -- an echo of her recent novelistic strategy. At other moments, her perspective becomes disembodied and panoramic, as in an essay on driving that considers the roads of the English countryside from the viewpoints of pedestrians and drivers, which becomes a metaphor for the ""peculiar difficulty in attaining objectivity."" If the ""Outline"" novels were an exercise in listening to, and weighing, the stories of others, in these essays, Cusk is similarly contending with inherited narratives -- marriage, civility, feminism -- to see whether they are still inhabitable, whether anything can be salvaged.

The second half of the collection includes critical pieces on D. H. Lawrence, Natalia Ginzburg and Louise Bourgeois, among others, and furnishes keyholes onto Cusk's aesthetic vision, one that is so rigorous and uncompromising that the term ""sensibility"" feels too frivolous. One is tempted to speak of her artistic ideology. An essay on women's writing contains her most explicit artistic manifesto. Drawing on Virginia Woolf and Simone de Beauvoir, Cusk argues that literature -- from the structure of the novel down to ""the very size and character of the literary sentence"" -- consists of forms made by men, and that women cannot create their own art using the master's tools. True women's writing, she believes, concerns itself ""with what is eternal and unvarying, with domesticity and motherhood and family life.""

One could object that motherhood is not every woman's destiny -- it is not mine -- but then, such complaints are precisely what makes writing so treacherous for women: Dare to draw larger observations from your life, and you are accused of generalizing. Fail to do so, and you are navel-gazing. Many writers respond to this dilemma by making their experience broadly ""relatable,"" becoming mouthpieces for certain ideas and demographics, a tactic that ends up diluting their authority. Cusk, like the best artists, has renovated her work from its deepest interior -- the self -- transforming her private crises into an expansive aesthetic vision. She believes entirely in D. H. Lawrence's claim that ""one is in oneself the whole of mankind,"" and her essays reveal how profoundly this individualistic vision suffuses her work, even when she is not physically ""there."" She has not obliterated the self but refracted it -- much as a woman imprints herself onto the furnishings of her home, or a mother onto her children, manifesting her image in everything she creates.","In ""Coventry,"" the British author of the widely admired ""Outline"" trilogy shows how central the self is to her artistic vision.",de9840bf-cebe-5f56-973c-58597f346dbd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/books/review/OGieblyn1/OGieblyn1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=55c2ee25f6a499245ca213f86721c0e0662c73e2043055b3d386299dfe75ebb7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Rachel Cusk&rsquo;s view of human nature has been honed and clarified by observing the nuances of private life.,de9840bf-cebe-5f56-973c-58597f346dbd,N24News/imgs/de9840bf-cebe-5f56-973c-58597f346dbd.jpg,13
Style,The Flea Circus,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/15/style/rose-bowl-flea-market-los-angeles.html,"PASADENA, Calif. -- At 4 a.m. on the second Sunday of every month, headlamps light up like fireflies in Lot K of the Rose Bowl Stadium here. They are worn by collectors searching for treasure: Hans Wegner club chairs, perfectly aged Levi's jeans (preferably from before 1971), and AC/DC and Wu Tang Clan concert T-shirts. Owners of vintage-clothing stores complain relentlessly about the deals being ""gone,"" yet they not only come back, but also scale the chain-link fence at the perimeter to get a head start before the gates open at 5 a.m. This is what Patrick Matamoros, a dealer who placed Kim Kardashian in a Sade shirt and Rihanna in a Whitney Houston one, did in August, shortly before he nearly came to blows with another vintage dealer. The immediate cause of their spat was a Black Crowes T-shirt, but the kerfuffle was years in the making.

""It just seemed so condescending,"" Mr. Matamoros said afterward. The argument escalated quickly. ""I called him a thief and a liar,"" Mr. Cole said. ""I said if he called me a thief again, bad things would happen,"" Mr. Matamoros said. Mr. Cole sneered at him and walked away. Once he saw the price tag, Mr. Matamoros turned regretful. ""It was $150,"" he said. ""It wasn't worth $50."" Still, he bought it from the seller. Partly because he felt responsible for destroying it. But mostly to spite Mr. Cole. ""I haven't had a chance to repair it yet,"" he said. All over the East Coast, flea markets are withering away. Buyers don't want to bundle up on winter mornings and scour for merchandise that can be found easily on eBay, Etsy or 1stdibs, with better guarantees. Sellers don't want to load pickup trucks with merchandise that can easily be sold online. Once frequented by Andy Warhol, Greta Garbo and Susan Sontag, the major weekly Manhattan flea markets in Chelsea began downsizing in 2005, after almost 30 years. The outpost inside the parking garage on West 25th Street closed in 2014.

""What's driving them is the desire to be cool and to have the next post on Instagram,"" Ms. Boes said, as she described how ""these kids"" scour through social-media posts, Goodwills and rag houses for rare finds. ""Then they wear it once or twice and sell it at the flea -- or over Instagram -- and buy something else."" The legalization of marijuana has also fortified the market, not simply because lots of dealers start getting high with one another at 6 a.m., but also because so many of the products being sold contain THC or refer to weed culture. Tristyn Rhoades, 29, is a self-described practicing witch who lives in the San Bernardino Valley with her husband and 3-year-old son. A year and a half ago, Ms. Rhoades turned her love of potions and spells into an apothecary business. During the week, she sells cannabis-oil-infused bath bombs over Etsy. On Saturdays, she brings them to the Silver Lake flea, sharing a booth with her friend Nicol Aiko, a 30-year-old jewelry designer who fashions gemstones into crescent moons, fairy and marijuana-leaf shapes. Ms. Rhoades is also among the 2,500 sellers paying about $100 for a booth at Rose Bowl, which for 50 years has taken place on the second Sunday of every month in the parking lots surrounding the 90,000-seat football stadium that the U.C.L.A. Bruins call home. The Rose Bowl flea was started by Richard Gary Canning, whose firm RG Canning Attractions began with concert promotion and car shows. The market was intended as a peripheral revenue stream.

In the 1970s and '80s, the Rose Bowl's biggest market was antiques, Mr. Redd said. In the early 2000s, the vintage-clothing market exploded and the Rose Bowl became a religious ritual for hoarder hipsters united in the desire to get baked and beat each other to Cross Colours jackets, Chanel handbags, Charlie Brown sweatshirts and other assorted pop-culture peculiarities. After rolling in before dawn, sellers use the next few hours to set up their stations and buy among themselves. Around 8 a.m., the Bowl becomes a street-style spectacular, as the bearded and tattooed rummage for Red Wing work boots amid collectors like Lisa Eisner, a jewelry designer and frequent companion to Tom Ford; the transgender actress Candis Cayne; and Brad Pitt, known among this crowd as much for his furniture expertise as for his movies. A few years back, Mr. Redd said, Mr. Pitt came in and spotted a chair he wanted. The seller was asking $600 for it. Mr. Pitt knew it was worth much more than that. So he pulled out a wad of cash and gave the seller a $2,000 bonus.

""Free O.J."" shirts from back when O.J. Simpson was on trial for the murder of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, abound. They usually trade for about $100 each, which is around what it costs to get an old R. Kelly shirt (not cheap for someone now infamous for alleged sex crimes). Nicholas Baier, a dreadlocked dealer at the Bowl, was shopping near his station and stumbled upon a shirt with a Confederate flag. He wasn't offended. ""I have Bill Cosby in my booth,"" he said with a shrug. ""It's history."" (Mr. Baier is white.) Recently, Mr. Matamoros has been buying up Russian Harley Davidson, Tower Records and McDonald's shirts. ""The potential for misinterpreting why someone is wearing a Russia shirt right now is awesome,"" he said. ""I want the shirts I sell to be political. I'm trying to say something."" Which is what, a reporter asked. ""Don't be boring!"" Mr. Matamoros said. Given how easy it is to search for concert tees on eBay, finding an authentic one from the Talking Heads 1983 tour for $50 has gotten increasingly unlikely. And shirts by Bell Biv Devoe and En Vogue cost a lot, the prices propelled by scarcity (most R&B and hip-hop acts from that time did not tour extensively) and surging demand from kids born in the '90s, who now have money, nostalgia and a desire to look like Kanye West, even as they make fun of his behavior.

The Oliphant brothers' wives are merely ""understanding,"" about their hobbies, according to Jeff, while Ms. Corbett has become an enthusiastic partner. After years of competing for customers at the Rose Bowl and bumping into one another at hobbyist events, the Corbetts and the Oliphants barely speak. ""It is what it is,"" Mr. Corbett said. And when Jeff Oliphant seemed particularly cheery on a recent summer morning, it didn't take long to figure out why. ""He's not here!"" Mr. Oliphant said, smiling brightly. Brian Cohen, a 44-year-old dealer who that morning was selling a rack of '50s-era harlequin print shirts, priced at $50 each, said: ""There could be an ensemble Christopher Guest movie based on the cast of characters at the Rose Bowl."" Mr. Cohen, wearing a retro flattop, as if he was the sidekick from a James Dean movie, wasn't being judgmental. In 2008, he plunked down $25,000 on a black crepe Hawaiian shirt with swirling tigers and bright red clouds. ""I only wore it once,"" he said. ""It's sitting in a bin with a bunch of other shirts, being enjoyed by no one.""

""There was so much action. I couldn't believe it,"" Mr. Cohen said. Soon after, he moved to Los Angeles and took a monthly space at the Rose Bowl. ""The night before, I couldn't even fall asleep,"" he said. ""I was just so excited about all the things I could sell, all the things I could buy."" He had a Pavlovian response to the stench of vintage clothes wafting through the dry Pasadena air. And he was fascinated by the people: driven by a compulsion to acquire, yet seldom displaying any serious inclination toward power and wealth. Indeed, many were selling simply so they could keep collecting. ""The biggest thrill wasn't really making a profit,"" Mr. Cohen said. ""It was finding that new rare piece for the collection."" The Bowl's organizers also defy the conventional laws of capitalism, even as the business got more complicated in the internet age. ""We do not tell sellers how to run their businesses, and we take no cut from sales,"" Mr. Redd said

When customers arrive at the Rose Bowl on Sunday mornings, Mr. Cohen said, the first sentence out of their mouth has become, ""'Is that really your best price?' Even if they don't speak English, they know the word 'discount.'"" Although Mr. Cohen has kept his head above water -- in 2016, he even opened his own store, Vintage on Hollywood, in Los Feliz -- finding balance is tough. ""My romantic life has definitely suffered because of this,"" he said, describing dates during which he tried to put his phone away but couldn't help himself when it started buzzing and he realized there were incoming photographs of clothes he was interested in buying. Today, there are a lot more young women selling at the Bowl, and many sell in smartly designed tented booths with tribal rugs on the ground. But Mr. Cohen disdainfully calls them ""the Etsy girls"" and laments their effect on the Bowl: ""It became all about ambience."" Sean McEvoy, 37, who has sold vintage Sonic Youth T-shirts and highly collectible denim at the Bowl for a decade, has a wife, Rikki McEvoy, who runs his online business

Mr. McEvoy walked over to to a seller with a collection of Levi's and picked out six pairs he thought he could resell. But getting the price from $1,700 to $850 was brutal. ""I got to have a ciggie,"" Mr. McEvoy said at one point. ""I'm getting stressed out."" Even after Mr. McEvoy prevailed, he seemed unsure of whether he'd gotten a great deal or a big discount on a rip-off. Off in the distance, Mr. Matamoros was complaining about the cost of his shirts. ""Every month it gets harder,"" he said. Yet the bowl is his calling and his compulsion. He knows what would happen if it went away. ""I'd be homeless,"" he said.","Dueling dealers! $1,000 T-shirts! Homemade fruit spreads! In the age of eBay, the Rose Bowl market's still got it.",8d8888c6-8517-5e5f-a8a3-c8117339e3ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/16/fashion/16FLEAMARKET9/16FLEAMARKET9-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=de92519bab53d2727a5088fe5ddcc7a35404464fc3209f6f2575eb9aca727e6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Running you Raggedy: some of the dolls and duds for sale on a typical Sunday at the Rose Bowl flea market.,8d8888c6-8517-5e5f-a8a3-c8117339e3ac,N24News/imgs/8d8888c6-8517-5e5f-a8a3-c8117339e3ac.jpg,15
Television,Emmys: Ramy Youssef Thinks Every Network Should Add a Muslim Show,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/28/arts/television/ramy-youssef-emmy-nominations.html,"I really thread it by talking about the things that are important to me, and that's why the show is called ""Ramy"" -- not only things that are important to me, but the things that me and my team can talk about in a thoughtful way. So we cover the things that are organic to our story, that are organic to our characters. And there's a lot left on the table that needs to be dug in. We just got a third season and we're excited to dig in to it more.

There are so many perspectives that fall under the umbrella of Muslim. So I just personally am very aware of not taking on that responsibility, because I was not elected by the Muslims.

What are some of other topics worth digging into? That you want to tackle next?

In a lot of ways, we just met these characters, we're just starting to see them. Right now, I think the world is really in a place where we're inside and we're really thinking about our relationships. For this show, a lot of characters and a lot of story lines are going to intersect, and people on our show are going to start finding out each other's secrets about what's really going on. We are really excited about that.

How did you get Mahershala Ali, a two-time Oscar winner, to star this season?

He's just reached out to his fellow Muslim, saying, this is so cool that you have characters who actually are back into faith. And I angled to get dinner with him. And then, of course, like any good Arab, I was like let's figure out a deal and we can get you on the show.

What else did you do differently in Season 2, based on what you learned from Season 1?

We just wanted to go deeper. So much of what happened in Season 1 was this character trying to figure out who he wants to be. And so it's very aspirational. But then Season 2, he realizes who he is, and you realize that he's got a lot of things yet to change. So it kind of shifts from being aspirational to being transformational.

We really wanted to watch him deal with his problems and get in his head more. And that took us into a deeper version of our tone. And it gave us the ability to have, with Mahershala, this genuine religious presence in Ramy's life to really understand just how much he's not a model Muslim at all.","""Ramy"" received three Emmy nominations on Tuesday.

Sports,The Last Islanders Team to Advance This Far Sees a Little of Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/11/sports/hockey/islanders-NHL-playoffs-1993.html,"The Islanders' Matt Martin, left, has scored five goals in the postseason, matching his regular-season total.





The Last Islanders Team to Advance This Far Sees a Little of Itself

TORONTO -- No one should be surprised that the Islanders advanced to the conference finals for the first time in 27 seasons. After all, their success derives from a familiar playbook: their own. Like the 1992-93 club, and to a certain extent the 1980s dynasty that won four consecutive Stanley Cups, the main connective tissue has been leadership: General Manager Bill Torrey and Coach Al Arbour then, and Lou Lamoriello and Barry Trotz now. All were of the same mold. They emphasized important principles of accountability and earned the trust of the players. Torrey was hired by the expansion Florida Panthers as their president in April 1993, but his fingerprints were all over that Islanders team. ""There's no variance with Lou,"" said Ray Ferraro, a TV analyst for TSN who was a key member of the 1993 team. ""And Barry has a great connective way with his players. They trust what he says and he can get his message to his players.""

These Islanders, of course, are trying to advance further than Ferraro's, who lost the conference finals in five games to the eventual champions, the Montreal Canadiens. But they are down, 2-1, to the Tampa Bay Lightning in their series in Edmonton, Alberta. They lost Game 2 after Nikita Kucherov broke a 1-1 with less than 10 seconds left, but won the next game, 5-3, on a go-ahead goal in the final five minutes. Like the 2020 version, the 1993 Islanders were a collection of hard-working players who excelled by playing solid defense and outworking their more skilled opponents. They also played with a lot of emotion, epitomized by the hard-hitting rookie defenseman Darius Kasparaitis, who helped neutralize the Penguins star Mario Lemieux as the Islanders beat Pittsburgh in seven games in the division finals. Scotty Bowman, who coached Pittsburgh to a repeat championship in 1992, sees similarities between Arbour and Trotz in how they learned how to develop a competitive roster in the early, lean years in their careers, with Trotz coaching expansion Nashville for its first 15 seasons. ""Al started with the Islanders when they were only in the second year,"" Bowman said. ""Trotz started with Nashville. They didn't have the players, so they had to figure out a way to stay competitive. I coached against Trotz when Nashville came in, and they were a tough team to play against."" The best scorer on the 1993 Islanders was Pierre Turgeon, who was coming off a career-best 58 goals in the regular season. But a blindside hit in Game 6 of the first round resulted in a separated shoulder, causing him to miss the ensuing series against the Penguins.

From the top-line players to the role players, the Islanders pulled together to compensate for the loss of Turgeon. ""What a great team,"" said Glenn Healy, the Islanders' starting goaltender in 1993. ""Not in the sense we were all going to the Hall of Fame because I don't think any of us are in the Hall. But we certainly were a Hall of Fame team in that we cared about each other."" It helped that Healy and Ferraro got hot at the right time. ""Heals had the six weeks of his career, I would say, and I had the six weeks of my career,"" Ferraro said. Ferraro, who missed three months of the 1992-93 season with a broken leg and dislocated ankle, caught lightning in a bottle. He scored eight goals in the first round against Washington, including four in one game, scored two overtime winners, and led the team with 13 goals in 18 postseason games. ""Every player who plays a long time has a time when everything is going their way,"" Ferraro said. ""It's described as being in the zone."" One player who was in the zone was forward David Volek, who had such a miserable season that the ownership wanted to get him off the roster. He scored the overtime winner, his second of the game, on a two-on-one with Ferraro in Game 7 against Pittsburgh. Another unlikely hero was forward Tom Fitzgerald. ""We were down in Game 4, and he scored two short-handed goals on the same penalty,"" Healy recalled, still incredulous. ""Same penalty. Otherwise we don't get to Game 7.""

They have adopted a defense-focused system in which all five players collapse toward their own net to support the goaltender and block as many shots as they can. But they are quick enough to race up ice on the forecheck to put pressure on the other team's defense. John Tonelli, who played with the teams of the 1980s dynasty, said that ""as a player who played for Al, you could see a lot of things we used to do, they are doing."" He continued, ""A good, solid team game, good support in front of their goaltender. You know, the Islanders."" Those 1980s teams were more skilled and complete than either the 1993 team or the current club. They had a strong two-way center in Bryan Trottier, a rugged power forward in Clark Gillies, an elite scorer in Mike Bossy, a tough offensive defenseman in Denis Potvin and a combative puck-stopper in Billy Smith. All five are in the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Trotz's Capitals were criticized as chronic underachievers because, although they won the Presidents' Trophy for finishing the regular season with the most points both in 2015-16 and 2016-17, they lost each time in the second round to the Penguins, who won the Stanley Cup both years. Finally, the Capitals broke through and knocked off the Penguins in 2018, and that momentum carried the Capitals to their first championship. Trotz joined the Islanders for the next season and has taken the Islanders to the postseason twice. ""I think Barry has a really good grip on what they are going through,"" said Gillies, one of 16 Islanders who played on all four Cup-winning Islanders teams. ""He went through two very tumultuous years in Washington before he won the Cup. He learned a lot of lessons. There are things we learned back in 1978 and 1979."" Potvin also sees a parallel between Torrey's trade acquisition of Butch Goring in 1980 and the trade this year by Lamoriello to bring in Jean-Gabriel Pageau. Goring was seen as the final piece of the puzzle for the Islanders, scoring 19 points in 21 postseason games to help the Islanders win the first of their four consecutive Stanley Cups, and being named the most valuable player of the playoffs the next season. Pageau, in turn, has been a sparkplug for the Islanders. He is among the Islanders' leading goal scorers while providing forward depth as the third-line center. Off the ice, the Islanders then and now made tight bonds. They live near each other on Long Island during the season, making for close friendships between them, their wives and families. ""The 1980 Islanders had terrific esprit de corps,"" said Stan Fischler, a hockey historian. ""Ditto for this club.""

The year-end team party in 1993 was a testament to how tight the club was, Healy said. Normally, some players are bitter that they didn't get enough ice time, or didn't get on the power play. ""Our entire group was out, and it was like it never ended for us,"" Healy said. ""A bunch of us even went to Ireland on vacation together."" Healy, who won a Stanley Cup with the Rangers in 1994, when they broke a 54-year Cup drought, sees this Islanders team as having some of the ingredients needed for a championship run, although the Lightning -- with 92 points in the regular season and having outscored the Isles, 10-3 in the first two games -- are more talented. ""The Islanders have got a good coach, they've got good structure, they understand what their roles are, and they care about one another,"" Healy said. ""That goes a long way.""","As happened in 1993, the timely help of role players lifted the franchise to the conference finals.

A car is often seen as the first taste of freedom for a teenage driver. But getting behind the wheel, especially for longer trips, calls for skills and preparation. According to Allstate Roadside Services, younger drivers were the ones most likely to have car trouble when on the road.

Here are some tips to consider before your trip.

Know How to Change a Tire

""Changing a tire can be a daunting task, but is actually quite straightforward with the right tools and preparation,"" said Sarah Robinson, a Michelin tire safety expert. Ms. Robinson recommends ""evaluating the task start to finish, before you even begin."" This includes making sure you are in a safe location and that you have the proper tools to change the flat.

Directions on how to change a tire are on this Bridgestone Tire page, along with an instructional video.","Make sure your vehicle is ready, and be prepared for emergencies.",bd8e188a-fee9-5324-b4ee-99a6139a3a22,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/10/26/travel/26breakdown/26breakdown-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=371cef6c1751e436cb75daf91d8ed4d75a9907b43c7c340ed88f84cb8b9d0ab5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Car breaks down on couple.,bd8e188a-fee9-5324-b4ee-99a6139a3a22,N24News/imgs/bd8e188a-fee9-5324-b4ee-99a6139a3a22.jpg,4
Theater,Taran Killam Assumes the Throne in 'Hamilton',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/10/theater/taran-killam-assumes-the-throne-in-hamilton.html,"On Broadway, at least, everyone loves a pompous, thin-skinned autocrat. It's why  couldn't be more excited to join ""Hamilton"" as King George, the blustery British monarch who, with a few memorable pop tunes, warns the upstart American colonists that they'll regret their revolutionary acts. The role, which Mr. Killam inherits from Rory O'Malley (Jonathan Groff, Andrew Rannells and Brian d'Arcy James have also played the character), will be his Broadway debut when he begins on Jan. 17. It's a big opportunity for Mr. Killam, 34, an alumnus of ""Saturday Night Live"" who is close with the ""Hamilton"" creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and its director, Thomas Kail. ""I don't want to let my friends down, more than anything,"" Mr. Killam said in late December over a pub lunch in TriBeCa. This is also the first major project that Mr. Killam will be seen in since it was reported last summer that he would not be returning to ""S.N.L.,"" where he had spent six seasons playing politicians like Donald J. Trump, Ted Cruz and Paul D. Ryan, as well as characters like Jebidiah Atkinson, a feisty newspaper critic from the 1860s. Mr. Killam had recently returned to NBC's Manhattan headquarters to appear on ""Late Night With Seth Meyers."" Though ""S.N.L."" was dark that week, he did not want to seem too eager to roam the sets and offices. ""It's still too fresh,"" Mr. Killam said. ""I didn't want to be Matthew McConaughey from 'Dazed and Confused.'""

Mr. Killam also talked about his preparations for ""Hamilton"" and his unlikely sketch comedy career. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. As we speak, you've just started rehearsing your role as King George. Does it feel like a good fit? Of course, the king is the appropriate role for me. Not to mention my skin pigmentation really helps in getting cast. I was like, ""This is going to be a piece of cake; I know his songs like the back of my hand."" And then we did those songs within 15 minutes, and the next hour and a half was all the harmonies that the king has to sing for the rest of the show. Which I did not know.

Do you think your ""Weekend Update"" appearances as Jebidiah Atkinson helped get you cast? Obviously there's very funny parallels between Jebidiah and King George: the dandy-ness of the character, the theatricality. You studied musical theater at U.C.L.A. Was it an accident that you ended up in sketch comedy? Complete accident. Kenan Thompson and I had the same manager, and ""MadTV"" called to see if Kenan would want to audition. I was a very good mimic, so they said, ""There's this really funny kid, if you want to do something different."" I think I ended up doing 23 different impressions to audition, and got it. The TV Guide article that announced it said the comedians Bobby Lee and  are joining. I'm like, I'm not a comedian. But it turned out I was O.K. at it, so I stuck with it for a while.

Were you disappointed you weren't brought back to ""S.N.L."" this season? I found out the final decision while I was on set, directing my first movie [""Why We're Killing Gunther""]. Part of the decision came from this pilot offer from Showtime [""Mating""]. If it wasn't this past season, it was going to be this season, and that's really what the conversation was about. I think they probably asked the question, why fill a year, just because? Honestly, thank goodness. Because it's a tough schedule, and ""S.N.L."" just does require all of you. Your wife, Cobie Smulders, is making her Broadway debut this spring in a revival of ""Present Laughter."" Do you compare notes? Every day. ""Were you on the stage? Did you have your fitting?"" The fitting was the most fun of my first official week. You go to these amazing loft spaces in the middle of Manhattan, and they are the people who do period garments for the last 50 years of Broadway. They're like: ""All right, spread your legs. Turn around. No, your hips are 35, trust me. O.K., bye."" No ceremony at all. If Vice President-elect Mike Pence made a return visit to ""Hamilton,"" what would you say to him? I'd give him all the credit in the world for coming back. I spoke to a few cast members after that happened. If I needed another reason to be proud to be part of this ensemble, it's the way that was handled, with grace and respect. There's a ritual that ""Hamilton"" holds, called the Order of the Garter, each time it brings in a new King George. Does the new guy also get hazed? We all know what bullies those musical theater kids are. Is there a cape raid where they steal my cape and dip it in cold water and put it in the freezer the night before my first show? That's what I would do.","Post-""S.N.L.,"" Mr. Killam is ready to become the perfectly blustery British monarch on Broadway.",579c1cf2-9657-5bb7-8769-4760b26c2222,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/15/arts/15SNAPSHOT/15SNAPSHOT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=0d3d6dab7cfb42eeee912522c69a09a2cb510cd5ab919138f92394704237834a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Taran Killam,579c1cf2-9657-5bb7-8769-4760b26c2222,N24News/imgs/579c1cf2-9657-5bb7-8769-4760b26c2222.jpg,10
Science,"Mountain Lion Tracked in Southern California Likely Died in Woolsey Fire, Park Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/27/us/p74-mountain-lion-woolsey-fire.html,"The Backbone Trail in the Santa Monica Mountains, after the Woolsey Fire burned through the area.

On the morning of Nov. 9, a wildfire busted out of a small area outside Los Angeles, jumped Highway 101 and ignited the jagged hills of the Santa Monica Mountains. In its fiery path were thousands of homes and residents, and a mountain lion named P-74. It was the last day P-74 was seen alive. While the wildfire, known as the Woolsey Fire, raged through the slopes and canyons over the next two weeks, scorching over 1,500 buildings and killing three people, park rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains searched for GPS signals from about a dozen mountain lions constantly tracked there. All of them were eventually located alive except for P-74, a roughly one-year-old male and the newest member of the group. On Monday, rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a vast area of trails and parks on federal land overlooking the Pacific Ocean, confirmed what they had feared was true: P-74 likely died in the blaze. His GPS collar last sent a signal at 1 p.m. on Nov. 9, but failed to register at the next automatic check-in, at 5 p.m. that same day. ""We never got another point after that,"" Seth Riley, the wildlife branch chief at the recreation area, said in an interview on Tuesday. ""The fire came through that evening in his area.""

With the help of firefighters, Mr. Riley and other park officials searched the seared terrain, including the exact area of P-74's last known location, for any signs that he survived. But they came up with nothing, leading Mr. Riley to conclude that P-74 was trapped in the fire and his collar destroyed. No other animals that are tracked by rangers, including coyotes and four bobcats, were believed to have died, he said. The Woolsey Fire engulfed a swath of subdivisions and wildlife in the hills above Malibu, charring nearly 97,000 acres by the time firefighters were able to contain it on Nov. 21. A separate wildfire in Northern California, the Camp Fire, roared during the same period and has killed at least 88 people, though it was contained on Nov. 25. While many people lost homes, the Woolsey Fire also devastated the delicate urban habitat home to an estimated 10 to 15 mountain lions in the Santa Monica Mountains. The Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area stretches about 154,000 acres in northwest Los Angeles County and is largely defined by Highway 101 to the north and the Pacific Ocean to the south. The imposing boundaries trap wildlife in the area and make it nearly impossible for newcomers to enter.

[Sign up for the Morning Briefing newsletter for a look at what you need to know to begin your day.] The animals that did survive had to flee to the fertile and habitable areas that remain. Park rangers are closely monitoring how they adapt and survive in what is one of the largest urban wildlife areas in the world. ""It's an interesting and massive experiment,"" Mr. Riley said. ""You eliminate the natural habitat from half of it, and then what is going to happen?"" While the site became a national recreation area in 1978, the park did not begin to track the mammals there until the 1990s, starting with bobcats and coyotes. In 2002, rangers started to trap mountain lions, affix GPS devices to them and map their movements. The latest addition to the group was P-74, who wandered into a cage in mid-September that park rangers had set up with the remains of a recently killed deer. With his GPS collar attached, P-74 was spotted about a month later with a female mountain lion believed to be his mother. Park rangers do not know whether that female, which did not have a GPS collar, also died, Mr. Riley said. While all the other mountain lions with collars survived, rangers are still concerned about the health of one male named P-64, perhaps the most adventurous member of the group. Mr. Riley said that P-64 had found a safe way to travel between parts of the park separated by the busy Highway 101: through a narrow, dark tunnel under the highway.","P-74, the newest mountain lion electronically tracked by park rangers in the Santa Monica Mountains, was last seen in one of the first areas to be scorched in the blaze.",353e7de2-b7ea-5c88-9da3-4f15ed6c8c37,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/04/us/28xp-lion/28xp-lion-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0ebc132d1eb077d74fa153a47ea7a1679b57825cca53229478bb57c781d1c751&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"P-74 was the newest member of a group of mountain lions that park rangers in Southern California have tracked with GPS collars.

Style,Johan Lindsten: A Different Kind of Sampler,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/05/style/johan-lindsten-furniture-design-chairs.html,"Geography is destiny, or at least it was for Johan Lindsten. Mr. Lindsten, 34, grew up in a forested part of Sweden called the ""furniture kingdom,"" which is home to Ikea and dozens of other housewares companies. Today, lo and behold, he designs furniture, including chairs with needlepoint nature scenes that have put him on an international stage.

""I always had a furniture culture in my life,"" he said by phone from Stockholm, rattling off family members in the business: cabinetmaker grandfather, architect sister, structural engineer brother, and so forth.

But what really got him started was a hunt for a CD rack at age 13. He couldn't find any he liked, so he designed and made one himself. Ever since, he said, the joy of creativity has ""followed me.""","In his chairs for Cappellini, the Swedish designer shows off an affection for needlepoint.",68f8eea4-f549-56af-8683-795bc7761e78,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/05/garden/05HOMEjohan/05HOMEjohan-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=e672877046034ad9835759b2621386a81bf8fbe6ff14dbb412320091f5bfba18&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Swedish designer Johan Lindsten, got his start in furniture design when at age 13 he couldn't find a CD rack he liked.

Art & Design,What to See in New York Art Galleries This Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/06/arts/design/what-to-see-in-new-york-art-galleries-this-week.html,"As seen in this marvel of a show in Greenwich Village, Paul Bloodgood (1960-2018) pursued poetry and painting with equal intensity and a lyricism grounded in the physical. In both pursuits, he excelled at turning the efforts of others into his own. His verses are scrappily beautiful collage-poems achieved by cutting, pasting, excising and mating words and phrases by different writers into seamless meditations on humanity, death and art. For example ""Study for Jack's Name Painting"" (2008-11) begins with a line from a Robert Musil essay and segues into words from Ray Carney's book on the films of John Cassavetes. The first line of another poem crucially alters Theodor Adorno's famous insistence that ""every work of art is an uncommitted crime."" Mr. Bloodgood changed ""crime"" to ""repetition,"" asserting that his art does not commit repetition.

This is confirmed by ""X After 1000"" (2000), Mr. Bloodgood's version of a Chinese landscape ink painting. It is a towering exaltation of oil paint, with each rock, bush, cliff and tree given its own colors and texture, while waterfalls of pure white cut among them. Several works here seem to riff on this painting, dismantling it, abstracting it and flooding it with white, as in ""Study for Composition by Field,"" from 2008. In other canvases, planes of color and areas of white balance landscape and abstraction behind scaffoldings of green lines. The latest painting is from around 2017, when Mr. Bloodgood was suffering from early-onset Alzheimer's. It is a field of thick, scratched white with a scumbled wedge of red ocher pushing in from the right. Relatively simple, possibly unfinished, it still conveys the natural intensity of Mr. Bloodgood's hand.

In addition to being a poet-painter, Mr. Bloodgood in 1989 helped found and operate the artist-run gallery AC Project Room (with Alissa Friedman and the sculptor Anne Chu, among others), which continued at different addresses until 2001. AC gave early shows to several stellar artists, including Ms. Chu, Matthew Ritchie, Isa Genzken and Josiah McElheny, and its history is touched on here by three vitrines of ephemera. The photographs, letters and announcement cards attest that Mr. Bloodgood favored collaboration in life as well as in art.

Always a subtle and witty cultural commentator, Lutz Bacher lands right on the political money with this solo show, organized by Nicola Lees and Robert Snowden at 80WSE Gallery. ""The Long March,"" installed in the gallery itself, is made up of dozens of small, same-size, no-two-alike photographic images of Mao Zedong. Commercially printed in China, the series is a mass-produced exercise in personality-cult promotion. Mao, young or old, often dressed in military gray (the gallery walls are painted the same color) greets officials or chats up peasants in one staged scene after another. Because the images are clearly advertising, it's tempting to take them in at a sweep, but considering them one by one is instructive. It lets you experience the mechanics of persuasion. Visual repetition -- the face, the hair, the uniform -- can cast a spell. We may believe that Mao was, for much of his career, a monster, but when we see him over and over playing benign, made-for-the-camera-roles, we can lose sight of that. He becomes a legend, a star, a part of our history. He may be awful, but he's our very own awful, the awful we love to hate.

A second solo exhibition by this artist, ""Open the Kimono,"" which closed in its original form on Sept. 1, was presented as a photographic slide show in a New York University lecture hall several blocks away from Washington Square. All the photographs were of scraps of paper on which the artist had jotted down phrases lifted from radio talk shows, advertisements and overheard conversations. Some of the phrases (""I believe in love"") were bland-inane; others (""Facelift in minutes at home"") were pop-weird; still others (""You interested in brown girls specifically?"") creepily personal; and more than a few (""Enhanced interrogation techniques,"" ""We are in a post-truth environment"") were direct references to current politics. Together, they added up to the equivalent of handwritten tweets, a random harvest of outtakes from the surreality show that is American culture right now. The book version of the exhibition -- a slide lecture translated into a textbook, you might say -- will be celebrated on Saturday evening at the gallery.

For several decades, Andy Warhol was the patron saint of artists obsessed with mass media and celebrity culture, a fixation he expressed to the mainstream in a deadpan, affectless demeanor. For the current generation, that title may be shifting to the underground filmmaker and performance artist Jack Smith (1932-89). Mr. Smith is best known for the films ""Flaming Creatures"" (1962-63) and ""Normal Love"" (1963-65), which gained immediate notoriety because of the obscenity charges leveled against them. ""Jack Smith: Art Crust of Spiritual Oasis,"" at Artists Space, expands that view beyond the 1960s with work made from the '70s until his death, of AIDS-related causes, in 1989.

Some of the photographs and ephemera here relate to the Plaster Foundation of Atlantis, a loft on Greene Street to which Mr. Smith moved in 1969, and which he turned into a kind of theater, with performances every Saturday at midnight. ""Third critic-free week!"" one flier boasts. Other drawings and posters include barbs against landlords and the market-driven art world (Mr. Smith was later evicted from that loft for not paying rent); there's also a hand-scrawled syllabus revealing his deep knowledge of film. Creatures like lobsters, cockroaches and sharks serve as alter egos and characters in his work. Material relating to the performance ""It Could Begin With Art"" (1974) includes photographs and German television footage of Mr. Smith in the role of an eagle named Ronald De Carlo, walking around the zoo in Cologne, Germany, collecting ""rent"" from the animals. ""In Search of Sinbad,"" an unfinished epic film project started in the late '70s, features costume designs that imagine Sinbad morphing into a leopard. A poster for the performance ""I Danced With a Penguin"" (1983) describes Mr. Smith as an ""exotic theatrical genius,"" which feels surprisingly accurate. He was also very camp, a sensibility Susan Sontag (a fan of Mr. Smith's) detailed in her famous essay ""Notes on Camp"" (1964). In Sontag's view, camp is exemplified by the exaggerated and artificial and is important because it ""neutralizes moral indignation, sponsors playfulness."" Our era is all about the exaggerated and artificial: hyper-posed selfies, hybrid identities, drag-queen reality shows. And suddenly Mr. Smith's playful excess, once deemed obscene, feels prescient and perfect.",Paul Bloodgood's collage-poems; Lutz Bacher's examination of Mao Zedong's cult of personality; and a Jack Smith retrospective at Artists Space.,e2077d65-afcc-5fad-aa67-9e17c46a5dfe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/arts/07galleries1/07galleries1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=2699d41e8e32392f43a26b4f79ed1f7fdbc62d7773da6a45ff80edea03f5560f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;X After 1000,&rdquo; from 2000, Paul Bloodgood&rsquo;s version of a Chinese landscape ink painting.",e2077d65-afcc-5fad-aa67-9e17c46a5dfe,N24News/imgs/e2077d65-afcc-5fad-aa67-9e17c46a5dfe.jpg,14
Automobiles,Terrafugia Transition,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/24/automobiles/terrafugia-transition.html,"The ideal flying car might take to the roads and the skies with equal aplomb, but Carl Dietrich, a co-founder of Terrafugia in Woburn, Mass., is unapologetic about the raison d'etre of his company's Transition. ""We think of it as a street-legal airplane,"" he said. ""It's an airplane that has the capability of driving safely on roads and highways and parking in a single-car garage.""

As such, the target customer for the $279,000 Transition is someone who regularly takes trips of 100 to 500 miles and wants to be able to fly directly between local or regional airports, then drive to a destination unfettered by bad weather, traffic or speed traps. Mr. Dietrich noted that one customer intended to tow his Transition behind an R.V.: ""They have their car, their plane, their house in one mobile package, and they can do whatever the hell they want."" The current version of the two-seat Transition has been in flight and road testing for two years, Mr. Dietrich said, logging multiple flights at altitudes up to 7,000 feet. Its fuel-injected 4-cylinder Rotax 912iS engine produces 100 horsepower and runs on auto fuel, driving the rear wheels on the ground and a pusher propeller in the air. Cruising speeds are about 100 m.p.h. in the air and about 70 m.p.h. on the road. The transition from car to plane -- as the wings fold down -- takes about a minute in addition to a preflight check.

Terrafugia is taking $10,000 deposits for the Transition and hopes to start deliveries in the second quarter of 2016.

Regardless of whether that target is met, the company is already looking ahead. The hybrid electric TF-X concept would be a ""semiautonomous"" vehicle, limiting the driver-pilot's hands-on involvement to decisions about takeoff and landing sites, and last-minute assessments about the weather.",The current version of the two-seat Transition has been in flight and road testing for two years.

Economy,Obama Sends Pro-Business Signal With Adviser Choice,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/22/business/economy/22obama.html,"SCHENECTADY, N.Y. -- President Obama, sending another strong signal that he intends to make the White House more business-friendly, named a high-profile corporate executive on Friday as his chief outside economic adviser, continuing his efforts to show more focus on job creation and reclaim the political center. Here in the birthplace of General Electric, Mr. Obama introduced the new appointee, Jeffrey R. Immelt, the company's chairman and chief executive officer, who will serve as chairman of his outside panel of economic advisers. Mr. Immelt succeeds Paul A. Volcker, the former Federal Reserve chairman, who is stepping down. The selection of Mr. Immelt, who was at Mr. Obama's side during his trip to India last year, and again this week during the visit of President Hu Jintao of China, is the latest in a string of pro-business steps taken by the president. He has installed William M. Daley, a former JPMorgan Chase executive, as his chief of staff; is planning a major speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce next month; and just this week ordered federal agencies to review regulations with an eye toward eliminating some. Together, the moves amount to a carefully choreographed shift in strategy for the White House, both substantively and on the public relations front. Mr. Obama has started making the case that the United States has moved past economic crisis mode and is entering ""a new phase of our recovery,"" which demands an emphasis on job creation.

And with corporate profits healthy again, the president has begun engaging business leaders more on what it will take for them to start investing again in new plants and equipment and stepping up hiring. As he moves into the second half of his term and lays the foundation for his 2012 re-election campaign, Mr. Obama is trying to frame the national conversation on the economy around this crisis-to-job-creation narrative. Republicans, who have spent their first weeks of the new Congress talking about repealing Mr. Obama's health care bill and cutting federal spending, have given the president an opening to do so. The themes the president struck here, on competitiveness and the turning point in the economy, are expected to be at the heart of the State of the Union address he will deliver Tuesday. ""The past two years were about pulling our economy back from the brink,"" Mr. Obama said, standing against the backdrop of a huge generator in a well-lighted plant, with a giant American flag hanging from the ceiling. ""The next two years, our job now is putting our economy into overdrive."" He went on, ""Our job is to do everything we can to ensure that businesses can take root and folks can find good jobs and America is leading the global competition that will determine our success in the 21st century.""

The appointment of Mr. Immelt, who will retain his posts at G.E., is not without complications for Mr. Obama. G.E., one of the nation's largest companies, routinely has a wide variety of regulatory, trade, contracting and other issues before the federal government, on matters as varied as television mergers, military hardware and environmental cleanup. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve provided $16.1 billion to General Electric by buying short-term corporate i.o.u.'s from the company at a time when the public market for such debt had nearly frozen. Having the chief executive of such a company advising the White House on job creation at a time when Mr. Obama is assuming a more deregulatory posture could further alienate liberals and be seen as undermining the White House's commitment to reducing the influence of lobbyists and special interests. Another complicating factor is union uneasiness about outsourcing by G.E. Officials at the United Electrical Workers Union say the company has closed 29 plants in the United States and one in Canada in the past two years, eliminating more than 3,000 jobs. ""We understand the logic of asking someone like that to step up and play a leading role,"" said Damon Silvers, the policy director for the AFL-CIO. ""But there's a real tension there in making a G.E. executive a central figure thinking about U.S. jobs."" But Gary Sheffer, a General Electric spokesman, said the company has also been shifting operations back to the United States, and has added 6,000 jobs in this country, for a net increase. For example, Mr. Sheffer said, G.E. is moving all of its refrigerator manufacturing business back to the United States. He said 60 percent of G.E.'s revenues come from outside the country.

At the same time, G.E.'s exports have roughly doubled in the past five years, which makes the company a good showcase for a president who is trying to promote trade and exports as a way to repair the battered economy. Exports were a major theme of the president's India trip and the state visit by President Hu; Mr. Immelt was among the business leaders who attended a high-level meeting with Mr. Hu, as well as the state dinner at the White House on Wednesday. General Electric is benefiting from Mr. Obama's emphasis on exports. When the president was in Mumbai, he announced a string of deals involving American companies, including a $750 million order from Reliance Power Ltd., in Samalkot, India, for steam turbines manufactured by G.E. Those turbines will be made here in Schenectady, a point Mr. Obama drove home in his remarks. ""This plant is what that trip was all about,"" Mr. Obama said. ""That new business halfway around the world is going to help support more than 1,200 manufacturing jobs and more than 400 engineering jobs right here in this community, because of that sale."" Mr. Immelt's White House job will be as chairman of the Council on Jobs and Competitiveness, a newly named panel that Mr. Obama is creating by executive order; the president said Friday that he intends to name additional members, including business and labor leaders and economists, ""in the coming days."" The change in the council's name is intended to signify a shift in White House focus. It will be a reconfigured version of the board that Mr. Volcker led, the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, of which Mr. Immelt was a member. That body, created by Mr. Obama when he took office in the thick of the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, is set to expire Feb. 6.","The selection of Jeffrey R.

Dance,"Denied Romantic Bliss, He Goes a-Roaming",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/08/arts/dance/jessica-langs-the-wanderer-a-premiere-at-bam.html,"Ms. Lang's choreographic skill and imagination are most apparent in the four other dancers, who serve as a kind of chorus. They act out the wanderer's fantasies of domestic bliss as well as his premonitions of death. (In her images, Ms. Lang is as attentive to the text as she is to the rhythmic flow of the music.) Like water, they often reflect the dancing of the main characters, amplifying it into compositions of dynamic symmetry.

The integration of Mr. LaBrie is equally excellent. Beginning on the balcony, he moves down -- at the perfect point, during the transitional song ""Pause"" -- to sing among the dancers, heightening the intensity of his relation to them and to the audience close by. Ms. Lang's overall use of the Fishman Space is, like so much else about the production, thoughtful and adept.

If only merit were enough to win love. Ms. Lang's conception of the brook tilts the ardent lyricism of the Romantic tale toward soap opera, and the performances -- overbright smiles; strained, tortured grimaces -- push it over the edge. The sex, while injecting some welcome grit, turns the story into a parable against subtlety that the production exemplifies too well. There are depths and shaded ambiguities to the Schubert and to Mr. LaBrie's impassioned singing that the choreography, fluent yet almost anonymous in style, doesn't touch.

Economy,"Piece by Piece, a Factory-Made Answer for a Housing Squeeze",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/07/business/economy/modular-housing.html,"Credit...Christie Hemm Klok for The New York Times





VALLEJO, Calif. -- California is in the middle of an affordable-housing crisis that cities across the state are struggling to solve. Rick Holliday, a longtime Bay Area real estate developer, thinks one answer lies in an old shipyard in Vallejo, about 40 minutes northeast of San Francisco. Here, in a football-field-sized warehouse where workers used to make submarines, Mr. Holliday recently opened Factory OS, a factory that manufactures homes. In one end go wood, pipes, tile, sinks and toilets; out another come individual apartments that can be trucked to a construction site and bolted together in months. ""If we don't build housing differently, then no one can have any housing,"" Mr. Holliday said during a recent tour, as he passed assembly-line workstations and stacks of raw materials like windows, pipes and rolls of pink insulation.

Construction prices nationwide have risen about 5 percent a year for the past three years, according to the Turner Building Cost Index. Costs have gone up even faster in big cities and across California, according to RSMeans, a unit of Gordian, which compiles construction data. In the Bay Area, builders say construction prices are up 30 percent over the past three years -- so much that even luxury projects are being stalled by rising costs. ""It's reached the point where you cannot get enough rent or you cannot sell enough units to make it a viable deal,"" said Lou Vasquez, a founding partner and managing director of Build, a real estate developer in San Francisco. The surge in construction prices is coming at the worst possible time for booming cities like New York, Seattle and San Francisco, already dealing with an affordable-housing crunch that has increased the homeless populations and stoked acrimonious debates about growth and gentrification. City and state legislators have tried to tackle their housing problems with proposals to increase subsidized affordable housing, reduce building regulations and make it legal to build taller. But even if every overpriced city suddenly overcame the thicket of zoning rules and neighborhood opposition that make it difficult to build new housing in the first place -- which seems doubtful -- today's diminished building industry would lack the capacity to build at the needed pace. This affects the rich as well as the poor, because it raises the cost of high-end condos and affordable housing alike. Later this year, California residents will vote on a proposed $4 billion bond to build more subsidized affordable housing. In San Francisco, where developers say the per-unit construction cost is edging toward $800,000, that would buy about 5,000 units, a relative blip. ""Costs have risen so much that it is not possible to build homes where people want to live at the prices and rents they can afford,"" said John Burns, founder of John Burns Real Estate Consulting.

""The current system can't meet demand and that's resulting in a lack of opportunity for some folks and a major hit to the economy,"" said Stonly Baptiste, a co-founder of Urban Us, a Brooklyn-based venture capital firm that invested in Blokable. ""These aren't small problems and they aren't small markets."" The technologies vary but generally involve simplifying construction through prefabricated panels that can be assembled like Ikea furniture and modular apartments that can be stacked together like Lego bricks. A recent survey by FMI, a management-consulting and investment banking company focused on the engineering and construction industry, found a third of respondents said they were looking at some form of off-site construction, a steep rise from 2010. The interest extends from housing to hotels to medical facilities, industrial companies and even fast-food restaurants. ""It's one of those things that looks like an overnight success but it's taken 10 years and hundreds of people toiling,"" said Chris Giattina, chief executive of BLOX, a Birmingham, Ala., company that builds hospitals with modular components. The global construction industry is a $10 trillion behemoth whose structures determine where people live, how they get to work and what cities look like. It is also one of the world's least efficient businesses. The construction productivity rate -- how much building workers do for each hour of labor they put in -- has been flat since 1945, according to the McKinsey Global Institute. Over that period, sectors like agriculture, manufacturing and retail saw their productivity rates surge by as much as 1,500 percent. In other words, while the rest of the economy has been supercharged by machines, computers and robots, construction companies are about as efficient as they were in World War II. To understand this, consider how buildings are actually built. It all starts with the developer, who doesn't actually build anything but instead secures a piece of land and a loan, and gets the project approved by the government. At that point the money is passed to the general contractor that made a successful bid to build the project, who passes it to subcontractors that won the bidding for things like plumbing and sheet metal work, which often pass it to even more subcontractors. Contractors describe this handoff as ""brokering risk."" What they mean is that while everyone in the chain has agreed to build a certain piece of the project for a set amount of money and in a given amount of time, none of them are sure they can do so as cheaply or quickly as they've promised. They broker that risk by paying someone else to do it for them, minus a small fee.

""Say you're a general contractor and your subcontractor agrees to do a job. Once we have a contract I don't care how many man hours you put into it because that's your problem now,"" said Randy Miller, chief executive of RAD Urban, describing the thinking behind the process.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The goal of prefabricated building companies is to turn this model on its head. Instead of offloading risk, the contractor assumes all of it. Instead of sending jobs to subcontractors, they hire their own factory workers. ""The general contractor says, 'Oh my God, construction is scary, let me broker all that risk,'"" Mr. Miller said. ""I'm saying, 'Oh my God, construction is scary, let me plan and control it."" The basic concept isn't new. In 1624, Massachusetts settlers built homes out of prefabricated materials shipped from England. The pattern was repeated in Australia, Africa and India as the British Empire shipped colonists and structures wide across the globe, according to ""Prefab Architecture,"" by Ryan E. Smith, a professor at the University of Utah. Over the next few centuries, new versions of the idea seemed to pop up anywhere people needed to build lots of homes in a hurry -- during the California Gold Rush, after the Chicago fire, and through America's westward expansion. In the early part of the 20th century, Sears sold tens of thousands of kits for Sears Modern Homes, which consisted of prefabricated parts and panels that buyers assembled.

Along the way, the construction industry absorbed manufacturing concepts such as the assembly-line techniques that were utilized by Levitt & Sons, the pioneer of mass-built subdivisions. But the idea of factory-built housing was never adopted long or widely enough to make an impact, at least in the United States. One reason the United States has lagged behind Europe, Australia and Asia -- which all have well-established companies doing modular and prefabricated building -- is that it is a predominantly suburban nation, and the vast supply of open land has kept the cost of single-family-home building relatively low. Another is that the construction industry has slim profit margins and invests little in research and development. The chances of being burned are high, and each high-profile failure leads to a furlough of the concept. In the mid-2000s housing boom, Pulte Homes, one of the country's largest builders, opened a prefabrication plant that aimed to revolutionize how homes were built. The company closed it with the onset of the housing bust in 2007.

Now, instead of single-family homes, companies doing prefab building are focusing on higher-density condominiums and apartments. That's because, while single-family home construction remains well below its level before the recession, multifamily condominium and apartment buildings have rebounded strongly. ""Our goal is to be able to do a 40-story tower in 12 months, at half the cost of traditional construction,"" said Mr. Miller of RAD Urban. Still, even if builders are able to reduce construction costs, that doesn't necessarily mean they will be successful. Behind each of these companies is a bet that they can build far more efficiently than current methods. That bet has yet to be proven, at least on a large scale. Mr. Holliday of Factory OS started thinking about modular housing about four years ago, when he was struggling to build a project in Truckee, Calif., a mountain town of about 15,000 people near Lake Tahoe. The idea was to build a cluster of 800 to 1,000 high-density apartments and condominiums, but ""the numbers wouldn't work,"" he said. ""You couldn't get the construction costs down enough.""

Mr. Holliday floated the idea of modular building to his longtime contractor, Larry Pace, from Cannon Constructors, who over the past four decades has built various projects from one-off homes to high-rise condo and office towers. ""I said 'modular jobs have been a fiasco -- we don't need that in our lives,'"" Mr. Pace recalled, adding an expletive for emphasis. But Mr. Holliday persisted, and he and Mr. Pace used modular technology from two manufacturers to build four projects in the Bay Area. They are planning to do the same with the original Truckee development. Mr. Pace became so comfortable with modular that he suggested that they find some investors and build a factory of their own. On a recent afternoon, Mr. Pace laid out the factory's process. At the first station, just past the door, four workers toiled above and below a raised platform to build what would eventually become the floor. The two men up top laid down flooring while a man and woman stood below simultaneously installing pipes.

From there the unit would move steadily down the line, and, over 21 additional stations, would acquire toilets, indoor walls, outdoor walls, a roof, electric outlets, windows, sinks, countertops and tiling. It takes about a week to finish a unit, Mr. Pace said. The goal is to churn out about 2,000 apartments a year, which would be turned into four- and five-story buildings with 80 to 150 units each. For workers, factory building seems to mean lower wages but steadier work. Factory OS pays about $30 an hour with medical insurance and two weeks of vacation. That's about half what workers can make on a construction site, but the work is more regular and, for many, requires less commuting. Tony Vandewark, a 51-year-old foreman at Factory OS, is OK with the trade-off. Mr. Vandewark lives a few minutes from the factory in Vallejo, where homes cost less than half what they do closer to San Francisco. Contrast that with a job he once had in the Silicon Valley city of Sunnyvale. Mr. Vandewark drove two hours to work and three hours home before deciding to rent a room so he could stay closer to work on weekdays. ""On a job site, you can go do piece work and make really big money, but then the job is gone,"" he said. In addition to not being rained on, one of the key differences between a construction site and Factory OS is that any worker can be trained to do any job. And for old-school trade unions, that is a declaration of war. ""The business model is 'Hooray for me,'"" without regard for anyone else, said Larry Mazzola Jr., business manager of UA Local 38, a San Francisco plumbers' union with about 2,500 members across Northern California. Factory OS is not anti-union: It has a contract with the Northern California Carpenters Regional Council, which has organized other modular factories and is banking on the technology's continued growth. The issue is that builders are laid out like a Detroit auto factory, where one union represents all of the workers, and workers can be trained to do any job within the company walls. That is a huge departure from construction sites, where unions representing plumbers, electricians, carpenters and various other trades each control their piece of the building process. Last year Mr. Mazzola wrote a letter to San Francisco's mayor, Ed Lee, a month before he died, urging him to deny any city business -- such as contracts for subsidized housing -- to Factory OS.

""Any decision to use Factory OS shows a blatant disregard for the other craft unions,"" he wrote. He asked the mayor to refrain from contracting with the company unless it allowed craft unions to do their pieces of the work. ""We realize modular is coming and we want to be part of it, but not at the expense of our workers, which is what's happening right now,"" Mr. Mazzola said in an interview. Jay Bradshaw, director of organizing for the carpenters' council representing Factory OS workers, said that would be impractical. Think back to that first station, where four people worked above and below the floor. In Mr. Mazzola's world, a plumbers' union would represent the workers installing pipes, while other unions would represent the workers up top. ""It would never work to have upward of 10 or 15 labor organizations at a single employer in a factory setting,"" Mr. Bradshaw said. For Mr. Bradshaw, the real fight isn't defending job titles but making sure construction workers remain part of a union at all. A short drive from Factory OS, at a carpenters' training center, the union is developing a program to train housing-factory workers -- something that, it hopes, will prepare more people for an industry that it has come to see as inevitable. ""It sure blows the hell out of building in China,"" he said.",Developers are taking on residential building challenges by extending the concept of prefabricated housing to manufacture entire apartment buildings.,ca9c9a3f-4cef-52c5-bf76-0c62cfccd433,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/10/business/10MODULAR-1/10MODULAR-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8d1d31d19c27de7f91432c260040e5affb81c35557041d929c39acf176fc09a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Factory OS in Vallejo, Calif., individual segments of modular homes are built at a series of stations, each devoted to a specific part of the process.

Tiffany Do and Elish Le, both from northern New Jersey, met at Rutgers University. They later moved to Murray Hill in Manhattan, where they shared a two-bedroom with another couple. The rent rose. So they moved to a tiny studio on the sixth and top floor of a walk-up building on the Far East Side. The rent was low, just $1,810 a month, utilities included, but the living situation was difficult. ""We definitely got what we paid for,"" Mr. Le said.

Only one person could fit in the kitchen, which was tiny, with a refrigerator to match. The dish rack consumed the counter, so they improvised, balancing a cutting board on the stovetop. ""I eat a lot of food, which means I need a lot of counter space and a full-size refrigerator,"" said Mr. Le, 27, a personal trainer and a competitive powerlifter in the 220-pound weight class. Ms. Le, who works as a corporate recruiter in the fashion industry, is also a competitive powerlifter. Ms. Le, 26, made her grocery purchases according to how much she could carry, limiting soda to one bottle at a time. Food shopping ""was one of the biggest headaches or stress points for me,"" she said.

The many flights of stairs annoyed them both. ""Just because I can handle it doesn't mean it makes my life any easier or adds value to my life,"" Mr. Le said. ""I would prefer to leave my fitness activities to when they are planned and measurable."" As their lease approached expiration last fall, the couple went on the hunt for someplace bigger and better. They budgeted about $2,500 a month. Meanwhile, last summer, they started training at a new gym in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Squats and Science Barbell, one of the few in the city suitable for competitive powerlifters, they say. The trip there took an hour each way. ""In order to perform at my best, I need to use equipment that would best simulate competition conditions,"" Mr. Le said. ""Because the equipment is so expensive and the sport is so niche, finding the right equipment is near impossible.""

Moving closer to the gym became a priority. They found a possibility in a small building on the Lower East Side, near Chinatown, where the monthly rent for a one-bedroom was in the low $2,000 range. ""We eat a lot in Chinatown, and the groceries are cheap,"" Ms. Le said. But the landlord declined to accept them because Mr. Le is self-employed. They were intrigued by a new rental building, Fifth and Wythe, on the prime north side of Williamsburg. The lively neighborhood was appealing, filled with restaurants, coffee shops and people in their mid-20s.

The project manager of the 164-unit building, Scott Bennett, a salesman at Citi Habitats, showed them several apartments. They chose an alcove studio. ""It gave us what we didn't have before,"" Mr. Le said, referring to the spacious kitchen, the elevator and the easy access to transportation. The rent was $2,723, with one month free. A week before their lease expired, however, they learned that the Williamsburg building was not quite ready for occupancy. Their landlord would not let them remain for just a month. If they renewed the lease, they had to either find a tenant to take it over, or pay a two-month fee to break it. Because of the delay, Fifth and Wythe offered one additional month of free rent. The couple also negotiated for $500 toward storage costs, which helped with ""all the headache we were going through,"" Ms. Le said. Meanwhile, they considered another new rental building, the Williams, this one in South Williamsburg. The location was more industrial. They decided to wait for Fifth and Wythe. The couple put their belongings in storage and spent a month with Ms. Le's parents in New Jersey. In early winter, they arrived at Fifth and Wythe, glad to have, at last, a comfortable and convenient living situation for them and their dogs, Bear and Shyla.","Tiffany and Elish Le, both competitive power lifters, found a new place that solved all the headaches of their sixth-floor walk-up.",a04cedd1-2ee9-514d-b6d5-e0aa5fcbab7b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/21/realestate/21HUNT-MAIN/21HUNT-MAIN-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8e23781e753873461913c71f9cddd11b169ed9c24b646f21033c2ebb5dfc855c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"THE RENTERS Tiffany and Elish Le with their dogs, Bear, left, and Shyla, in their new apartment in Brooklyn, N.Y.

Television,Stephen Colbert Has Doubts About the Clinton-Epstein Conspiracy Theory,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/arts/television/stephen-colbert-trump-epstein-clintons.html,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Officials said Saturday that the financier Jeffrey Epstein had committed suicide in his Manhattan jail cell, after being indicted last month for sex-trafficking girls. On Monday, the late-night hosts plunged into the conspiracy theories that have arisen since, including one involving the Clintons that President Trump retweeted.

""This has set off a wave of wild conspiracy theories online. The sort of stuff that only unstable, tin-foil-hat loons could possibly believe. So, Donald Trump."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""[Imitating Trump] Follow me down the rabbit hole here, O.K.? Who had the most to gain from Epstein's death besides me, who is on videotape partying with him and young women? And who controls all federal prisons? The president -- Bill Clinton!"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""I'm not saying the Clintons don't have any power -- they could definitely get a reservation at any restaurant in New York City, party of four, 7:00. On a Saturday? Maybe not. But masterminding a scheme to assassinate a high-profile prisoner in a maximum-security federal custody? They couldn't even mastermind a visit to Wisconsin."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

""Yeah, the president did this, which is pretty wild, because this is the type of moment where you would think the president would be the voice of reason. Instead, Trump is jumping into the fray. You know, he's basically that dad that when a fight breaks out in the Little League game, he runs into the field, but instead of breaking it up, he starts to body-slam the third graders."" -- TREVOR NOAH ""Yeah, they weren't checking in on Epstein and took him off suicide watch. Why? Look, I'm not an expert on psychology, but if someone tries to commit suicide, I don't think two more weeks of jail would suddenly improve their outlook on life."" -- TREVOR NOAH ""Seems like everybody thinks that something shady happened here. People on the right were saying it was the Clintons who killed Jeffrey. People on the left were saying Trump killed him. Jussie Smollett says it was two white Nigerian guys."" -- TREVOR NOAH ""Former Vice President Joe Biden apologized this weekend after misspeaking at an event and saying, quote, 'Poor kids are just as bright and just as talented as white kids,' adding, 'Sorry, that came out gay.'"" -- SETH MEYERS ""That's what happens when you let him out in the sun without a hat. Even Kellyanne Conway was like, 'What?'"" -- JIMMY KIMMEL ""Oh, I don't know what's worse, suggesting poor kids are synonymous with black kids or trying to cover it up by listing as many kids as he could and hoping no one would notice.

Books,Amy Chua: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/books/review/amy-chua-by-the-book.html,"The law professor and author, most recently, of ""Political Tribes"" loves comic novels: Kingsley Amis's ""Lucky Jim,"" she says, ""is possibly my all-time favorite book."" What books are on your nightstand? My nightstand is filled with junk, but next to my bed there's a huge pile of books. They include Elif Batuman's ""The Possessed,"" which is exhilaratingly great and somehow manages to be erudite about Russian literature and funny at the same time; Ali Smith's ""Autumn,"" which is about an eccentric friendship between an octogenarian and a young girl who share a love of words; Anne Enright's ""The Green Road""; Anthony Kronman's ""Confessions of a Born-Again Pagan""; Fredrik Logevall's ""Embers of War""; and Lisa Ko's ""The Leavers."" Oh, and ""The Art of Raising a Puppy,"" by the Monks of New Skete, which I'm rereading because I'm about to get two new puppies. Tell us about the last great book you read. Tara Westover's ""Educated,"" a memoir about a girl born into a survivalist family in the Idaho mountains who was not allowed to go to school and spent her days foraging for metal in a junkyard while trying to avoid the catalytic converters hurled at her by her fanatic, anti-government father. She somehow breaks free of the violence and emotional prison of her family and, against all odds, ends up getting a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. The book, which will be published on Feb. 20, is heart-wrenching. But it's also a beautiful testament to the power of education to open eyes and change lives. What's the best book you've read about the law? Any book in particular you like teaching to your law students?

James Forman Jr.'s ""Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America"" is brilliant and jarring. If everyone in America read it, maybe our country could start to heal. ""Imbeciles,"" by Adam Cohen, is another spectacular law-related book, built around the Supreme Court forced-sterilization case, Buck v. Bell. As for my students, I teach Contracts, and I always have them read parts of both Charles Fried's ""Contract as Promise"" and Patricia J. Williams's ""The Alchemy of Race and Rights,"" to give them two totally different moral perspectives. Williams's book is a revelation -- she has her great-great grandmother's slave contract -- and it always provokes intense, but non-knee-jerk class discussions. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

You wrote a memoir, ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother,"" that touched on many issues around parenthood. What are your favorite books on child rearing? I never read any child rearing books when I was raising my daughters; maybe that was my problem! I actually didn't intend for ""Battle Hymn"" to be a parenting book either. I had totally different hopes for the book. I've always loved books with wacky unreliable narrators. Believe it or not, my models for ""Battle Hymn"" were ""Pale Fire,"" by Vladimir Nabokov; ""Zeno's Conscience,"" by Italo Svevo; and ""A Confederacy of Dunces,"" by John Kennedy Toole. Also Dave Eggers's ""A Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,"" which, come to think of it, is a child-rearing book of sorts. Which books do you think best capture the current social and political moment in America? Well, I think the obvious answer is, on the one hand, books like J. D. Vance's ""Hillbilly Elegy"" and Nancy Isenberg's ""White Trash"" and, on the other hand, Ta-Nehisi Coates' ""We Were Eight Years in Power."" But I actually think many of the main dynamics roiling our society today were captured decades ago, by books like Neil Postman's 1985 ""Amusing Ourselves to Death,"" about the media's damaging effect on public discourse, Paul Fussell's 1983 ""Class,"" Richard Hofstadter's 1963 ""Anti-Intellectualism in American Life,"" and Walter Lippmann's 1922 ""Public Opinion,"" which talks about how out of touch America's cosmopolitan elites are with ordinary Americans. Which novelists do you especially enjoy reading? I love classics. Some of my favorites are Tolstoy's ""War and Peace,"" Eliot's ""Middlemarch,"" Flaubert's ""Salammbo,"" James's ""The Golden Bowl"" and Faulkner's ""The Sound and the Fury."" ""Dream of the Red Chamber,"" by Cao Xueqin, is also amazing. It took me a while (and at least five false starts) to get into it, but I ended up loving Gabriel Garcia Marquez's ""One Hundred Years of Solitude."" Julio Cortazar's ""Hopscotch"" made a big impact on me -- how ingenious to write a book whose chapters you could read in two different orders.

Which genres are you drawn to and which do you avoid? This is so embarrassing, but I can't read poetry. Try as I might, and I really have tried, I just don't get poems. I love novels and short stories, but for some reason poetry evades me. I consider it a deep moral failing in myself, especially because my husband and daughters are avid poetry lovers. A good friend gave me Edward Hirsch's ""How To Read a Poem,"" which I read and still have on my shelf, but it didn't work. Also, I'm not a fan of rambling books about traveling across the country while experimenting with psychedelic drugs. I need a plot.

Paper or electronic? One book at a time or several simultaneously? Morning or night? I read books related to my work in the morning, when I have my best concentration, and books for fun at night. I always read paper books -- I don't even know how to use Kindle. What book might people be surprised to find on your shelves? Maybe all the funny books I have, starting with Laurence Sterne's ""The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman,"" which starts off with the narrator as a homunculus (sperm) at the moment of his ill-conceived conception. Kingsley Amis's academic satire ""Lucky Jim"" is possibly my all-time favorite book. I still occasionally burst out laughing just thinking of the protagonist's nemesis Bertrand Welch, a pompous pseudo-intellectual who wears a beret and says ""You sam"" -- a stretched out version of ""You see."" More recently, David Sedaris's ""Me Talk Pretty One Day,"" B. J. Novak's ""One More Thing,"" and Ali Wentworth's ""Happily Ali After"" all had me on the floor. Which books were you most eager to introduce to your children? And which books have they introduced to you? Some of my own childhood favorites like Robert McCloskey's ""Make Way for Ducklings,"" Maurice Sendak's ""Pierre"" and ""Where the Wild Things Are,"" Crockett Johnson's ""Harold and the Purple Crayon"" and Esphyr Slobodkina's ""Caps for Sale."" Then, as the girls got older, ""Caddie Woodlawn,"" ""Black Beauty,"" ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,"" ""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" and ""From the Mixed-up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler."" My husband was in charge of reading Tolkien, ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and Lloyd Alexander's ""The Chronicles of Prydain"" with my daughters, and it was through the three of them that I got introduced to science fiction books like ""Dune."" Of the books you've written, which is your favorite or the most personally meaningful? A 2007 book called ""Day of Empire: How Hyperpowers Rise to Global Dominance -- and Why They Fall."" It argued that, relative to the societies around them, all of history's greatest powers were strikingly pluralistic and tolerant on their rise to power, and that in every case their decline coincided with a stark turn to intolerance and xenophobia. If only it had come out a decade later! But I'm an optimist. As I explore in my new book, ""Political Tribes,"" I think America has self-correction mechanisms built into our identity and our institutions.","The law professor and author Amy Chua never read parenting guides when her children were young — ""Maybe that was my problem!"" — and didn't intend to write one with ""Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother.""",29fcbb44-543e-5eb7-9852-88548ce5bd03,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/04/books/review/04ByTheBook/04ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a67548fe4ac236a7db341c3e19e1427e27f7daf9376b4bb41f301da3057eb1c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Amy Chua,29fcbb44-543e-5eb7-9852-88548ce5bd03,N24News/imgs/29fcbb44-543e-5eb7-9852-88548ce5bd03.jpg,13

Mike: Honestly, I am disappointed in you, but not for the reasons you think. I'm mostly hurt you didn't bring me back a souvenir like I asked. Did I not specify 15 pounds of macadamia nuts? Farhad: Well, next time. Anyway, speaking of people who are disappointed in me, we have a special guest today -- Nellie Bowles, who just joined The Times to cover digital culture. Nellie, I'm thrilled you could chat with us today. Here is the basic drill: We go over the big tech news of the week, make fun of Mike, and then make fun of Mike some more. Sound good?

Farhad: Great. O.K., here goes. So, let's start with Snap. Remember Snap? It made an app that teenagers really loved. They loved it so much people thought it would be the next Facebook. But yeah, no, that didn't happen. This week Snap's stock price plummeted after Morgan Stanley, the bank that led the company's recent I.P.O., issued a report downgrading the company's shares. Now Snap is trading under $17, its I.P.O. price. Mike: Talk about a knife in the back. Has Brian Nowak, the Morgan Stanley analyst who wrote the report, not heard of Snapchat's viral dancing hot dog? Billion-dollar idea right there. Farhad: What's ailing Snap? Facebook, obviously. The social giant has copied basically all of Snapchat's best features. Instagram, also owned by Facebook, seems to have kneecapped Snapchat's growth. Also, advertisers don't seem to be warming to Snap's platform. What can they do? Is Snap done? Mike: I don't think it's fair to count them out entirely. Snapchat still has a lot of highly engaged users who love the product, and the company is moving into augmented reality, via the aforementioned Mr. Hotdog.

Nellie: People seem to have overestimated how loyal kids are to apps and how impactful stunts like Spectacles are. But mostly I think Snap out-cooled itself. They designed the app to be explained by word-of-mouth, so olds like me couldn't use it very easily. The only snap I've snapped was me asking if I was snapping. That said, it's worrisome how fast Facebook consumed this company, its last real social competition. And it's a reminder that we may still be seeing only the beginning of Facebook's reign.

Mike: Honestly, I feel it's an issue of expectations. The bankers compared Snap to Facebook during the I.P.O. roadshow. But it's nowhere near the scale of Facebook, nor will it ever be. That was what Twitter's bankers did during its I.P.O., and look how well that worked for them in the long term. My advice, which I take to heart: Underpromise, overdeliver. Snapchat seemed to do the opposite. Farhad: In other news, the internet celebrated two big events this week. First, Prime Day. On this special day of grace, Peace Be Upon Jeff, we pledged our honor and devotion to Amazon. I picked up a few deals, and Amazon said it rang up huge sales of its Echo devices. Did you two find any bargains? Mike: Um, yeah. I went a little wild and bought a printer and a PlayStation. Paper documents and killing bad guys are two very important things to me. Thankfully, I did not buy 100 knockoff iPhone cables like everyone else. Farhad: The day after Prime Day, in an odd bit of timing, the internet moved on to the ""Day of Action"" -- a huge online protest in opposition of the Federal Communication Commission's plan to undo so-called net neutrality regulations. Lots of internet companies altered their sites to show off the horrors they say will come when the government scraps rules meant to prevent broadband companies from blocking or throttling certain sites online. The protests were big, but from my view, they weren't really internet-stopping; I'd doubt if they changed much of the politics of the issue. Am I wrong? Nellie: Never thought I'd say this, but you're completely right. Net neutrality isn't a charismatic issue, and it's difficult to galvanize folks to march for internet speed. Net neutrality rules could be scrapped before most people know what they were in the first place. Mike: Where is John Oliver and his viral video team when you need him? I agree with Nellie, it seems like a done deal, and quite tough to get into the weeds with folks in a way that would make them care about the issue either way. . I guess it's time to prepare to watch Netflix originals with the spinning wheel of latency interrupting me every so often?","Three Times tech reporters discuss Snap's difficulties as a public company, and the so-called net neutrality debate.",03857bc3-b5b9-52e0-b478-f8d820570931,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/16/technology/16technewsletter-web/16technewsletter-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=06549e91818e04196f7b6c621c1bfd847b21cad9212caf65cd51cfa3420cb650&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Snap's stock price plummeted after Morgan Stanley issued a report downgrading the company's shares.,03857bc3-b5b9-52e0-b478-f8d820570931,N24News/imgs/03857bc3-b5b9-52e0-b478-f8d820570931.jpg,20
Economy,"Fed, Eager to Show It's Listening, Welcomes Protesters",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/25/business/economy/fed-eager-to-show-its-listening-welcomes-protesters.html,"WASHINGTON -- When a dozen protesters in green T-shirts showed up two years ago at the Federal Reserve's annual conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo., they were regarded by many participants as an amusing addition. Two years later, they have won a place on the schedule. The protesters, who want the Fed to extend its economic stimulus campaign, are scheduled to meet on Thursday with eight members of the central bank's policy-making committee. At the start of a conference devoted to esoteric debates about monetary policy, officials will hear from people struggling to make ends meet. The Fed's effort to show that it is listening to its critics reflects the central bank's broader struggle to find its footing in an era whose great challenge is not the strength of inflation, but the weakness of economic growth. Officials are wrestling with the limits of monetary policy, the focus of the conference, even as they try to address simmering discontent among liberals who want stronger action and among conservatives who say the Fed has done too much.

The meeting also represents an unlikely victory for Ady Barkan, the 32-year-old lawyer who decided in 2012 that liberals should pay more attention to monetary policy. He now heads the ""Fed Up"" campaign, a national coalition of community and labor groups that plans to bring more than 100 protesters to Jackson Hole. ""We want to make sure that regular voices are being heard,"" Mr. Barkan said in beginning the campaign two years ago. The American economy, he said, was not working for all Americans -- particularly not for blacks and other minority groups. Fed officials so far have chosen to accommodate the group by applauding its efforts at public education, not by seriously engaging its arguments that interest rates should be raised more slowly. Esther George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, which hosts the Jackson Hole conference, arranged Thursday's meeting with the activists. She said in an interview earlier this year that the Fed must balance job growth with other issues, like financial stability. ""I am completely sympathetic,"" she said of the group's concerns. But she cautioned that the Fed's powers were limited. Pushing too hard to lower unemployment could lead to higher inflation, or speculative bubbles, that would force the Fed to raise interest rates more quickly. The resulting economic volatility could end up doing more harm than good. ""The Federal Reserve has become somehow the answer to many problems far beyond what we can actually address,"" she said. ""I wish I could fix all of it with a tool like monetary policy. But we can't.""

Even Mr. Barkan's supporters acknowledge the long odds. Fed Up's budget has grown to $2 million this year, from $145,000 in 2014, mostly from Good Ventures, a nonprofit foundation created by the Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, which describes the campaign as ""relatively unlikely to have an impact."" Fed Up's more visible success has come in pursuit of a longer-term goal: advocating for changes in the Fed's governance that could eventually shift its decision-making. In a report published earlier this year, Fed Up highlighted the Fed's lack of diversity. There are no blacks or Hispanics among the 17 officials on the Fed's policy-making committee of 12 regional bank presidents and five governors. No black or Hispanic has ever served as president of a regional reserve bank. Moreover, the report said that whites composed 83 percent of the directors of the Fed's 12 regional reserve banks, who select the regional presidents. Narayana Kocherlakota, former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, said that the absence of minorities was ""quite troubling."" ""Those kinds of persistent absences of key demographic groups really suggest that the appointment process, there is something that can be fixed there,"" he said. Fed Up also argued that bank executives should not sit on regional Fed boards. Under current law, bankers hold three of the nine seats on each board. The regional reserve banks are owned by the commercial banks in each district, although they operate under the authority of the Fed's board, a government agency whose members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate.

In May, 127 congressional Democrats signed a letter to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed chairwoman, calling attention to the Fed's lack of diversity and the influence of the banking industry. On the same day, a spokesman for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign said in a statement that ""Secretary Clinton believes that the Fed needs to be more representative of America as a whole and that common sense reforms -- like getting bankers off the boards of regional Federal Reserve Banks -- are long overdue."" Two months later, the Democratic Party adopted a campaign platform that included similar language, the first time in recent decades it mentioned the Fed. Andrew Levin, an economist at Dartmouth College, said Fed Up's greatest chance for significant influence was not in framing the current debate about interest rates, but in changing the Fed itself. He co-wrote a report that the campaign published Monday detailing a proposal to make the Fed a fully public institution. ""Having a diverse set of policy makers -- including African-Americans and Hispanics -- will influence the Fed's decision-making,"" he said. ""And it should. The public should have confidence that the public is well represented at the F.O.M.C. table."" Mr. Barkan started the ""Fed Up"" campaign after joining the Center for Popular Democracy in 2012, a few years after graduating from Yale Law School. He had read a 2011 article by the journalist Matthew Yglesias, titled ""Fed Up."" Unions and other advocacy groups were focused on minimum-wage laws. Mr. Barkan was compelled by the argument that they also should be focused on interest rates. ""Even if they move once less over the course of several years, that's still massive,"" he said earlier this year. ""The number of people who have jobs because of that, or higher wages, that dwarves a $15-an-hour wage increase in a smaller city.""","The Fed is trying to find its footing in an era whose challenge is not the strength of inflation, but the weakness of economic growth.",45a802d8-348f-5afc-b271-f0b5a2bcb7aa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/25/business/25FED/25FED-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=37c7f3831dbda7425fcd17675d36abcfc39d9ad88578cb41504bdd28f3b1a2fb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Members of the group Fed Up turned up at the Federal Reserve's annual conference last year.,45a802d8-348f-5afc-b271-f0b5a2bcb7aa,N24News/imgs/45a802d8-348f-5afc-b271-f0b5a2bcb7aa.jpg,8
Opinion,Starr Chamber: The Sequel,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/18/opinion/sunday/starr-dershowitz-trump-epstein.html,"Can a woman be president of the United States? I've covered the men who run the world my whole life. And there have been a lot of screw-ups, from Vietnam to Watergate to Afghanistan to Iraq to pushing the economy off a cliff. There has also been plenty of creepy behavior, culminating in the news that Donald Trump, Ken Starr and Alan Dershowitz have joined together in a pervy, hypocritical cabal to argue that Trump did not smirch the Constitution. So please, Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar, stop whingeing about sexism and just show how you could wield power like a boss. Ibid: Nancy Pelosi. When Steve Bannon called Pelosi a ""total assassin,"" according to the hot new book ""A Very Stable Genius,"" by Washington Post writers Phil Rucker and Carol Leonnig, he meant it as the highest compliment. You won't find Pelosi keening about gender; she's too busy taking care of business. Hillary Clinton did not lose because she was a woman. She faced sexism, of course, just as Barack Obama faced racism. She lost because she ran an entitled, joyless, nose-in-the air campaign and because she didn't emulate her husband's ethos of campaign 'til the last dog dies and the last bowling alley closes, and always make it about the voters. She lost because she and her campaign manager, Robby Mook, didn't listen to Bill Clinton, the world's leading expert on the white, male, rural vote, when he warned them that there was trouble and offered to help out.

Donald Trump operates from the id, which is fitting because he represents a last-gasp primal scream from working-class Americans threatened by the changes transforming the country. Women are now a majority of the work force and whites are heading toward a minority status. Hollywood cannot cling to its benighted -- and self-defeating -- desire to stay a white male club forever, despite the fact that women have always made up half the audience. Trump's ascent does not make it harder for women to ascend -- just the opposite. Look at the throng of women who were outraged enough about Trump to march and run and get elected in 2018. Once a woman electrifies Democrats the way J.F.K., Bill Clinton and Obama did -- and the way Trump does his base -- she will win. Trump is once more doing his part to energize women voters. On Friday, we learned that the president will get help from Starr and Dershowitz for the impeachment trial in the Senate. The Starr chamber was a shameful period of American history, with the prissy Puritan independent counsel hounding and virtually jailing Monica Lewinsky and producing hundreds of pages of panting, bodice-ripping prose that read more like bad erotica than a federal report, rife with lurid passages about breasts, stains and genitalia. Like the Rev. Arthur Dimmesdale and other Pharisaic Holy Rollers before him, the prosecutor who read the Bible and sang hymns when he jogged became fixated on sex in an unhealthy, warped way.

Even Trump was appalled. ""Starr's a freak,"" the bloviating builder told me back in 1999. ""I bet he's got something in his closet."" In other interviews, he called Starr ""a lunatic,"" ""a disaster"" and ""off his rocker,"" and expressed sympathy for Hillary having to stand by her man when he was ""being lambasted by this crazy Ken Starr, who is a total wacko."" Starr, who once clutched his pearls over Bill Clinton's sexual high jinks, is now going to bat for President ""Access Hollywood."" After playing an avenging Javert about foreplay in the Oval, Starr will now do his utmost to prove that a real abuse of power undermining Congress and American foreign policy is piffle. In 2007, he defended Jeffrey Epstein. By 2016, Starr was being ousted as president of Baptist Baylor University for failing to protect women and looking the other way when football players were accused and sometimes convicted of sexual assaults. In other words, he's a complete partisan hack who doesn't give a damn about sexual assault. And then there's Dershowitz, whose past clients have included such sterling fellows as Epstein, Claus von Bulow, O.J. Simpson and Harvey Weinstein. How did he miss Ted Bundy? Still, Dershowitz has put himself on the side of an impressive pantheon of villainy in the realm of violence against girls and women. Virginia Giuffre, Prince Andrew's accuser, has also claimed that she was offered as a teenager to Dershowitz for sex -- a contention that Dershowitz has denied in a countersuit. On Fox News, Dershowitz has made the case that it is Pelosi who put herself above the law by delaying the delivery of the articles of impeachment. Good luck with that one. The Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan government watchdog, a few days ago deemed that Trump's slimy Ukraine gambit violated a law. Yet Dershowitz will somehow argue that it doesn't represent high crimes and misdemeanors.",President Trump reaches deep into the perv barrel for his defense team.,66027c70-eaa1-58fe-bbe4-60caf9b5dabf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/19/opinion/19Dowd/19Dowd-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b2c011403090d98d80ebce46040aeb97bdf118b64d5f912bcd99b157eba22be6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ken Starr in January 1999, during the impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton.",66027c70-eaa1-58fe-bbe4-60caf9b5dabf,N24News/imgs/66027c70-eaa1-58fe-bbe4-60caf9b5dabf.jpg,11
Your Money,"A Homeowner With No Savings, but Some Options",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/your-money/24RURAL.html,"I F you're worried that you haven't saved enough for retirement, you're probably right. Most of us haven't. In fact, the Employee Benefit Research Institute found the majority of American workers had put away less than $25,000 for their golden years. But even those people are in better financial shape than Susanna Wilson, 70, who saved nothing. Her only dependable income is a Social Security check of about $900 a month. ""I can never retire,"" she said, her voice trembling as she stared at the floor of her living room in Grass Valley, Calif. ""Probably about every two weeks when the bills are due, that's when I get really worried. I think 'How am I going to pay this one?' "" It should never have come to this. Ms. Wilson attended the University of California, Berkeley, in the late 1950s, though she left before graduating to move to New York and marry her college sweetheart, the Minimalist sculptor and sometime rock musician Walter De Maria.

Ms. Wilson spent her prime earning years engaged in various creative endeavors in New York, mostly as a designer. Her clothing line, O'Susanna, found a home in the late 1970s at Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's. Glamour and Seventeen magazines featured Perfumes by Susanna, including a popular fragrance called Strawberry Love. In her 40s, Ms. Wilson moved to California and became a publicist. At her peak, she made around $65,000 a year, she said, and not a penny of that made its way into a retirement fund. ""One thing kind of led to another,"" Ms. Wilson said. ""I've always put all my money into my businesses. And I always thought the business I was in was going to be a great success."" She also raised a daughter, Corie, 36, who lives in Los Angeles with her two children and is not in a position to help her mother financially. Now twice divorced and living alone with her Shetland Sheepdog, Rooney, Ms. Wilson subsists on those government checks, plus a one-day-a-week job at a local jewelry store that pays $12.50 an hour. She received no alimony from either divorce. Ms. Wilson also makes little girls' dresses under her O'Susanna label, at a vintage Singer Featherweight sewing machine in her dining room. But she sells only about six a month for around $200. Grass Valley, an old gold mining town of 12,300 residents in the foothills of the Sierra Nevada, near Lake Tahoe, isn't an expensive place to live. But Ms. Wilson isn't the only one struggling. Her friend Molly Fisk, 55, a poet and teacher, was visiting the house and joked that her retirement planning was ""all tied up in MasterCard futures. Sad but true."" Ms. Wilson would probably manage on her current income, though not without sacrifice, were it not for the debt she had accumulated. All told, she averages about $1,400 in monthly income, including Social Security (adjusted for one of her former husbands' earnings). A third of that goes toward fixed expenses like utilities. She pays $300 toward a mortgage balance of $5,477. She inherited the house, fully paid off, from her parents, but took out the mortgage a few years ago to pay for repairs.

The balance of her income goes toward the monthly minimum payments on $9,000 in credit card debt, racked up for daily living expenses. ""I think I might just have to declare bankruptcy,"" she said. ""I just can't live with that."" Before she takes that drastic step, Ms. Wilson should consider some other options, said Elizabeth Rutter Baer, a certified financial planner in Lansing, Mich. She worries that Ms. Wilson is ""extremely close"" to the edge and isn't getting anywhere with her debt payments because she keeps putting more expenses, like food, on her credit cards. Yes, she could try to find other income, Ms. Baer said. But that's a short-term solution. At some point, despite her excellent health, Ms. Wilson may not be able to work. ""Bankruptcy is possible, but my advice is, let's liquidate assets and get those debts paid off,"" Ms. Baer said. To that end, Ms. Baer recommended something she said she had never before suggested: a reverse mortgage. Such mortgages allow homeowners to tap existing home equity to receive a lump sum or monthly checks. Unlike a home equity loan, however, borrowers don't have to make any repayments until they no longer live in the home. The strategy can be risky, with high fees and sometimes poor counseling for borrowers. Reverse mortgages are available only to homeowners 62 or older. ""Susanna is the ideal candidate,"" Ms. Baer said. ""This is one instance where it could work."" The house is valued from $150,000 to $200,000. Ms. Baer said Ms. Wilson should work with a bank to see if she could wrap the current mortgage into a reverse and then take cash out. Ms. Wilson is already making phone calls to explore the idea. Ms. Baer also noted that Ms. Wilson was part owner, with her two brothers, of several tracts of timberland in northern California. The land's value has dropped because of the economy, but Ms. Baer said that shouldn't stop them from selling it. ""Whatever the purpose of this land was before, today's the rainy day,"" she said. ""It may not be that much, but at this point $25,000 would change her life, totally."" Ms. Wilson said she was discussing this with her brothers and a real estate agent.","Susanna Wilson, 70 and with no savings, is afraid she will never be able to retire.

Automobiles,The German Lessons Are Paying Off,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/02/automobiles/autoreviews/german-lessons-are-paying-off.html,"The last two generations of Cadillac's CTS have come close to running with the best Germany has to offer. G.M.'s third try confidently drives to the front of the pack.

When Cadillac set out to revive its arthritic cars and unfashionable image, beginning with the original CTS sedan of 2003, the brand seemed as retirement-ready as many of its customers. But with billions of dollars from its parent, General Motors, and German competitors to inspire it, Cadillac is becoming the mobile version of a gentrified neighborhood. The old-timers have begun to move out, replaced by younger buyers who appreciate startling makeovers and unexpected twists on tradition. Cadillac still has a ways to go to match the cachet of German luxury brands. But the third-generation CTS puts Cadillac firmly in the conversation. That conversation may seem muddled for luxury shoppers, because the 2014 CTS speaks in many tongues, with three available engines, rear- or all-wheel drive and sticker prices that are likely to shock many Cadillac shoppers. So at the risk of oversimplification, let's simplify: The new CTS lineup includes one respectable luxury car and one truly exceptional car. That special car, the CTS Vsport, with a new 420-horsepower twin-turbo V6, is one of the most thrilling, focused sport sedans around -- good enough, in fact, to trump most rivals from Japan or Germany.

Strangely, the Vsport can actually cost less than the merely good basic CTS versions with less powerful 4- or 6-cylinder engines. The harbinger of these new Cadillacs, the original 2003 CTS, was a shovel-nosed attention-getter, like an ex-jock broadcaster wearing a loud jacket. As Cadillac's confidence has grown, its designs have matured. While the brand's signature sharp creases have softened, its cars remain instantly recognizable and distinctly American. The interiors are remarkably improved, including leather and fabric trim that has been cut and stitched by hand. Setting aside G.M.'s old, isolationist ways, Cadillac has mimicked the Germans with rigorous engineering development at the Nurburgring track. And like the Germans, Cadillac has enthusiastically melded sport, luxury and technology. The CTS's new brother, the compact ATS, has ably accepted its mission as a BMW 3 Series fighter. That frees the CTS, which shares the ATS's chassis, to move upmarket. Stretched 4.5 inches from the last version, the CTS is now a true midsize contender, a direct challenger to the Audi A6, BMW 5 Series, Lexus GS and Mercedes E-Class. With a leaner body and lower roofline, the CTS balances flash and subtlety in appealing fashion. The mostly graceful interior offers a handsome, reconfigurable digital driver's display and a choice of eight types of trim, including wood, aluminum and carbon fiber.

But for all the gains in visuals or features, what makes this a legitimate luxury sport sedan is the painstaking engineering beneath the skin. Once notorious for corpulent cars, Cadillac subjected every component to a gram-by-gram weight-saving strategy. Aluminum is used for the hood, doors and instrument-panel frame, magnesium for the engine mounts and cradle. The result is a rippled athlete that, in the guise of the 2.0T Luxury version, weighs just 3,649 pounds. That's 160 less than the benchmark BMW 528i, and about 360 less than a Mercedes E350. For once, the toned American can poke at the surplus strudel tucked around the Europeans' midsections. The engines start with the 2-liter turbo 4 borrowed from the ATS, with 272 horsepower, move on to Caddy's familiar 3.6-liter V-6 with 321 horsepower and top out with the Vsport's twin-turbo 3.6 V6 with 420 bit-champing horses. Four-cylinder and V6 all-wheel-drive versions get a 6-speed automatic transmission; there is a new paddle-shifted 8-speed Aisin automatic for rear-drive V6s. German-baiting performance comes at a price, and that's one area that gives pause: The most basic 4-cylinder CTS starts at $46,025, a $6,000 jump over last year's starter model (although that car came with a lackluster 3-liter V6, now discontinued). One of the two 2014 models I tested, a loaded 2.0T Premium, started at $62,725 and reached $66,420 with options. Let's come right out and say it: That's an awful lot of money for a 4-cylinder Cadillac. I suspect that many buyers could forgo the Premium version's plethora of driver aids, including blind-spot, lane-departure and collision warnings and a system that automatically parallel-parks the car. Yes, BMW is also peddling a 4-cylinder turbo in the basic, comparably priced 528i. But BMW's 240-horse TwinPower engine is stronger, smoother and at least 15 percent more fuel-efficient (though the 4-cylinder Caddy manages a respectable rating of 23 m.p.g. city, 30 m.p.g. highway).

A more sensible 2.0T Luxury model starts at $51,925, and the V6 3.6L Luxury at $54,625. But honestly, since the Caddy sails so blithely toward the $60,000 seas, fans might as well ante up for the version that can smack German rivals into the weeds: The Vsport offers Fourth of July fireworks for $59,995, well-equipped -- thousands less than a loaded 4-cylinder version. For 2014, Cadillac continues to sell carried-over versions of the last-generation CTS coupe, wagon and 556-horse CTS-V. There are some demerits. Cadillac claims a 13.7-cubic-foot trunk, but in practical terms, it may be the smallest trunk in the class. As usual, Cadillac's front seats -- the bottom cushions are notably, excruciatingly short -- aren't nearly as comfortable or adjustable as the Germans'. Then there's the CUE infotainment system. For a screen-based system predicated on touch, the touch controls are awful, especially the often unresponsive flush-mounted switches set on a dated-looking piano-black finish. But the rest is first-rate, even in the 4-cylinder version, from a sporty chassis that BMW could be proud of, to the optional magnetic suspension and track-worthy Brembo brakes. Cadillac has squeezed more torque from this version of the 2-liter 4 cylinder, at 295 pound-feet (compared with 260 in the ATS). This overachieving engine sends the CTS from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in about six seconds. Even on rain-lashed country roads in the Hudson Valley, the CTS's sophisticated setup allowed it to cruise in comfort or attack the road, depending on the driver's whim. As with the ATS, if you couldn't see the Cadillac crest you'd swear you were driving a slick European car. For underdog car brands, executives often say that all they can do is put out good products, one after another. Do that, they insist, and eventually recognition and sales will come.

In so doing -- and in contrast to its longtime crosstown rival, Lincoln, which still seems lost -- Cadillac has found a path to redemption and respect.","Cadillac is becoming the mobile version of a gentrified neighborhood: The old-timers have begun to move out, replaced by younger buyers.

Media,Gretchen Carlson's Fox News Contract Could Shroud Her Case in Secrecy,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/14/business/media/gretchen-carlsons-contract-could-shroud-her-case-in-secrecy.html,"When Gretchen Carlson sought her day in court with a sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes, her former boss at Fox News, Mr. Ailes's lawyers had a quick response: Move the case to arbitration. Experts and lawyers who have studied arbitration cases say that process, if enacted, could significantly impede Ms. Carlson's chances of prevailing. While arbitration is normally a secretive process, a typical plaintiff involved in arbitration would at least be able to speak publicly about his or her case. But Ms. Carlson, a former anchor who was let go last month, had a contract that makes the process even more secret, stipulating that ""all filings, evidence and testimony connected with the arbitration, and all relevant allegations and events leading up to the arbitration, shall be held in strict confidence."" ""The clause has much broader secrecy language than is common in arbitration,"" said F. Paul Bland Jr., an arbitration expert and executive director of the advocacy group Public Justice. ""This clause explicitly put in gag-order language on all facts and evidence relating to these types of allegations.""

The use of arbitration has proliferated over the last decade, as a soaring number of corporations have sought to keep employment disputes private. That is because arbitration in general is a private process, conducted out of public view with no judge or jury. By using the arbitration clauses to bar people from joining together as a group, employers, both large and small, have effectively taken away one of the few tools that workers have to fight harassment or discrimination. In a report issued just last week, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission noted that forced arbitration ""can prevent employees from learning about similar concerns shared by others in their workplace."" Some regulators and civil rights experts also worry that arbitration clauses can obscure patterns of wrongdoing. Strict confidentiality can turn up in a variety of contexts, from payday-lending outfits, which sometimes rely on them to conceal the true identity of lenders that operate through shell companies, to personal relationships. But, according to Mr. Bland, only a small minority of employers insert strict confidentiality provisions into their arbitration agreements with workers. Joseph Beachboard, a management-side lawyer at Ogletree Deakins, agreed that the provision was aggressive but said such provisions can be more common in high-profile settings that attract publicity.

In arguing for arbitration, Mr. Ailes's lawyers cited privacy as a crucial component of the employment contract. On Wednesday, David W. Garland, a lawyer representing Mr. Ailes, said, ""We view this as a common provision, to further the purposes of the arbitration, and for the benefit of all parties to the arbitration."" (Fox News directed all comment to Mr. Ailes's lawyers.) Still, confidentiality provisions have sometimes kept the details surrounding accusations of harassment and discrimination under wraps. In one example, American Apparel required many employees to agree to resolve disputes through arbitration, and to keep most of the details of the arbitration process completely private. Many employment contracts also included a confidentiality agreement that prohibited workers from publicly sharing personal details about Dov Charney, the company's founder and former chief executive. Those who did, the contracts stipulated, could be required to pay damages of $1 million. Several cases in which female employees sued American Apparel and Mr. Charney for sexual harassment were pushed out of court and into arbitration, where details were kept private. (An employee who accused Mr. Charney of choking him and rubbing dirt in his face did win the right to pursue his case in court in 2013.) Mr. Charney's board eventually let him go as chief executive in 2014. His lawyer, Keith Fink, said that tens of thousands of employees worked for the company while Mr. Charney built it and ran it, only a few of whom sued for harassment.

For Ms. Carlson, who has sued only Mr. Ailes and not Fox News, there are essentially two options for resisting the secrecy Fox has tried to impose. The first is to have a court toss out the arbitration agreement altogether.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. But she will face an uphill battle, thanks in part to a recent Supreme Court decision that enshrined the use of arbitration clauses. Judges have also cited one of the most fundamental principles of contract law to uphold the clauses: A contract, once signed, is binding.

Ms. Carlson's lawyers could try to use that notion to their advantage. To defeat the clause, her legal team has argued that her contract covers only a suit against Fox News, not one against Mr. Ailes, who is not explicitly mentioned in the contract. ""To the extent that Ailes is a stranger to the agreement, he doesn't necessarily get to take advantage of it,"" said Matt Wessler, a principal at Gupta Wessler with extensive experience arguing arbitration cases on behalf of plaintiffs. ""It's a very significant as yet unresolved question."" Even the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, widely seen as one of the more conservative federal appeals courts in the country, recently invalidated an arbitration agreement on this basis. Ms. Carlson could also argue that the conduct she complained about had little to do with her employment relationship with Mr. Ailes and therefore shouldn't be subject to arbitration. ""She could come in and say, 'Look, I went there to be a broadcaster, not to have this guy look at my rear end,'"" said Mr. Bland, alluding to an accusation in Ms. Carlson's complaint. Courts have sided with some plaintiffs who made this argument, although the alleged conduct in those cases tends to be more serious than anything Ms. Carlson has alleged. In arbitration, the rules tilt toward businesses, employment experts say. Instead of judges, cases are decided by arbitrators who sometimes consider the companies that routinely bring them business their clients, according to interviews with arbitrators. The more times companies go to arbitration, the better they fare, concluded a 2011 analysis by Alexander J. S. Colvin, a professor at the Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor Relations.","If the former Fox News anchor's suit is forced into arbitration, her chances of winning are lessened, and little will be made public about it.",875040a6-2013-5d33-80d4-1096a30c7974,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/14/business/14CARLSON-1/14CARLSON-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=c13c51422e94b0253f40cafd59897269feccac93b717ec2c2c478b956e59c97d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gretchen Carlson has sued only Roger Ailes, not Fox News.",875040a6-2013-5d33-80d4-1096a30c7974,N24News/imgs/875040a6-2013-5d33-80d4-1096a30c7974.jpg,16
Real Estate,Trial by Rental,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/realestate/city-to-suburb-trial-by-rental.html,"JUDITH AND SCOTT FROST lived with their two young daughters in an apartment on West 86th Street, its 1,100 square feet festooned with decorative molding and topped by high ceilings. Mr. Frost works in finance, and Ms. Frost runs an Upper West Side organization called Little Global Village where small children can learn a foreign language. Both loved the pace of urban life. But as with many families, the prospect of an additional child altered the picture. ""When I became pregnant with our third child, that sort of pushed us over the edge,"" said Ms. Frost, who is 36. ""All of a sudden I wanted to be able to open a back door and get the girls outside."" The Frosts began house-hunting in the Riverdale section of the Bronx but were dismayed by the size of the taxes. They liked Bronxville, N.Y., but the inventory was minuscule. So they decided to do something that is not so common among New Yorkers moving to the suburbs. Instead of buying a house, they stuck a toe in suburban waters by renting one.

""Given the dismaying economic news over the past few years, people are afraid,"" said Roberta Baldwin, a partner in Keller Williams Realty who recently had five houses for rent in Montclair, N.J., and now has one. ""This is the biggest purchase they'll ever make, and for many people it's too daunting until they've immersed themselves in the fabric of a place."" Another economic factor is at work. ""Prior to 2008,"" Ms. Baldwin said, ""people felt they had to grab a place because the competition was so great. But now that prices are still flat or rising modestly, people feel they can take time to look around."" Because home prices are not escalating quickly, some owners choose to rent out a house they can't easily sell. Thus houses that might not otherwise be up for rent are available. In addition, many would-be suburbanites are increasingly choosy. ""There's a new group of buyers, Gen X and Gen Y,"" Ms. Baldwin said. ""They're used to living well, and they don't want to make an architectural or a geographical mistake. They feel they're entitled. And so they're stepping tentatively."" Happily for this population, suburban rents tend to be the same or lower than in the city. Even taking into account property taxes, the money and psychic energy that families save when it comes to schooling are considerable. And the stigma that once attached to suburban families who rent rather than own seems to have largely disappeared. Families preparing to make the big leap to the suburbs want to make sure they will land in the right place, or as Ms. Frost summed it up: ""We weren't comfortable making such a large investment before we really knew a neighborhood. Before paying out a huge amount of money, we wanted to make sure a town was a good fit.""

""When we arrived, we barely knew our neighbors,"" said Ms. Frost, whose baby is due this month, ""but they came over with baked goods and housewarming gifts. And we love the vibe. We like that not everyone in our neighborhood is wearing tennis whites."" All in all, she added, ""it's a great transition for people who aren't ready to let go of the city."" For suburban newbies, a town's personality is key. While vast amounts of information about everything from taxes to school test scores are available online, to get a sense of subtle but critical factors that determine a town's true nature, some say there's no substitute for sinking a few roots. Renting gives you time to see how people dress, observe their habits and eavesdrop on their conversations. ""The car line where parents drop their children off at school tells you a lot,"" said Esther Davidowitz, editor in chief of a cluster of magazines about Westchester County. ""If you're the only Toyota in a line of Mercedes, maybe it's not exactly your town. If the moms are wearing makeup at 8 in the morning and you're in your pj's and T-shirt, that's a bit of a hint, too."" Other factors determine a town's feel, according to Alison Bernstein, the founder of Suburban Jungle Realty Group, an agency that deals solely with suburb-bound New Yorkers. ""For example,"" Ms. Bernstein said, ""in summer, does the town empty out because everyone goes to the Hamptons? Is it a country-club town, or do people barbecue in their backyard? It may sound ridiculous, but these things are part of everyday life."" Once in a great while, a family will test-drive the suburbs, then decide that they miss urban life more than they expected and head back to the city. ""But that's very rare,"" said Ms. Baldwin, the broker from New Jersey. ""I'd say 99 percent of people who start out by renting in the suburbs want to make it permanent.""

The fit between a family and a community was a key issue for Brian Leftwich and Kara Payne-Leftwich, a couple in their mid-30s who lived in a 1,100-square-foot apartment near the South Street Seaport. Mr. Leftwich owns a firm that does fund-raising and business development for hedge funds, and Ms. Payne-Leftwich worked as an actress and a teacher until the birth of their first child. Last week the couple, with their daughter, 3, and their son, 6 months, moved to a 3,600-square-foot house in Montclair, for which they have a 19-month lease. The 1897 house is rich in original details, among them hand-woven wall coverings and moldings that remind Ms. Payne-Leftwich of her grandmother's house near Rochester. The yard has such a lovely slope, Ms. Payne-Leftwich can already picture her children sledding down it come winter. Along with a manageable commute and room for a home office for Mr. Leftwich, a key issue in choosing a community was its diversity. ""We liked the diversity of the city,"" Ms. Payne-Leftwich said, ""and we wanted our children exposed to people of different backgrounds."" Economics played a major role in the decision to start out as renters. ""Buying is such a big commitment, so permanent,"" said Mr. Leftwich, who hasn't lived in a suburb since he was growing up outside Washington. ""We wanted to move, but we didn't want to make a blind move. This way, if we didn't like it, we weren't stuck."" For Ms. Payne-Leftwich, the issues were more emotional. ""I held onto the notion that we'd live in New York,"" she said. ""We've grown accustomed to this lifestyle, and Montclair feels far away. I know some people who moved to the suburbs and then returned to the city. So we figured, let's not make that commitment until we're sure.""

She still has mixed feelings, as she indicated a few weeks ago: ""Sometimes I tear up just buying bananas from the street vendor near the corner, because I know I'll miss that experience. At the same time, the apartment is so cluttered, I'm excited to be moving somewhere new."" For confirmed urbanites like Jennifer and Alistair Macpherson, Londoners in their early 30s who had spent four years in Upper West Side high-rises, taking baby steps into suburban life felt especially appealing. ""We were passionately in love with the Upper West Side,"" said Ms. Macpherson, who, like her husband, is an actuary. ""We weren't passionate to leave."" But the couple had a son, Aidan, now 3, and when their second one, Dylan, was born last October, they began looking at houses in Westchester County, which they selected because of the easy commute to Mr. Macpherson's office opposite Grand Central Terminal. ""After looking at 15 houses, however, we realized that we didn't know the area well enough to make a permanent decision,"" Ms. Macpherson said. The quiet of the suburbs also made the couple slightly uneasy. And so in April they rented a 1924 three-bedroom in Scarsdale, for which they pay $3,400 a month. For Mr. Macpherson, the commute is almost as quick as it was when they lived in Manhattan.

Not everyone who test-drives the suburbs by renting is motivated by an expanding family. Lilia Vassileva, 29, an actress, and her husband, Steven Eheart, 30, the operations manager at the Atlantic Theater Company in Chelsea, had never felt at home in the city. ""We lived in Manhattan for two years because everyone said it would be such a great place,"" Ms. Vassileva said. ""But we weren't happy there."" One memorably awful apartment faced brick walls. ""We moved several times,"" she said. ""But we didn't find peace."" Last March, almost on a whim, the couple drove to Westchester and contacted a real estate agent. In July they signed a two-year lease for a cream-colored stucco four-bedroom in Yonkers. The couple declined to say how much they were paying. But similar properties nearby rent for $3,000 to $5,000 a month, according to their broker, Rose Carmellino of Houlihan Lawrence. ""Given our experience in Manhattan, we didn't feel settled enough to buy,"" Ms. Vassileva said. ""We didn't want suburban life, but New York City hadn't worked for us.""","For city dwellers, buying a house in the suburbs may seem logical square-foot-wise, but economically and culturally, it can be a big leap. That's why some rent first.",cd702b0c-9270-5766-b833-9f2eb81e9324,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/10/07/realestate/07COVER_SPAN/07COVER_SPAN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2012&h=371&w=600&s=f8bdabd51466fcb00801c19dd25b90bdc790378cfc45275b814ff633ef92b423&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Alistair Macpherson with Dylan, 11 months, and Aidan, 3, in a rental in Scarsdale, N.Y.",cd702b0c-9270-5766-b833-9f2eb81e9324,N24News/imgs/cd702b0c-9270-5766-b833-9f2eb81e9324.jpg,7
Dance,"At New York Live Arts, Thomas O. Kriegsmann Is Ready to Take Risks",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/07/arts/dance/at-new-york-live-arts-thomas-o-kriegsmann-is-ready-to-take-risks.html,"These are the brash words New York Live Arts uses to describe the artists who make up its fall season, which begins with Louise Lecavalier on Wednesday. (Ms. Lecavalier, best known for her career with Edouard Lock's La La La Human Steps, falls under ""maverick."") This is the first season planned by Thomas O. Kriegsmann, who became director of programs in November. Is he a radical? A transformer? A savior? Time will tell. Right now, he's just keeping up. New York Live Arts was established nearly five years ago when the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company merged with Dance Theater Workshop, a 45-year-old organization that had ushered in the careers of choreographers like Mr. Jones and Mark Morris, as well as Whoopi Goldberg. Dance Theater needed financial stability, and Mr. Jones needed a home for his company; since the merger, the Jones/Zane group has performed regular seasons at the theater in Chelsea. Administratively, Live Arts has seen a lot of turnover since its inception: Its executive director and chief executive, Jean Davidson; its artistic director, Carla Peterson (who, after the merger, worked under Mr. Jones); and recently, its associate director of communications, Elizabeth Cooke, have all gone. The search is on for a new executive director.

Even so, Mr. Kriegsmann, a broad-shouldered man with a face framed by ringlets, said that all he saw was potential. But it hasn't been easy. ""Three months,"" Mr. Kriegsmann, 40, said in an interview at Live Arts. That turned out to be how much time he had to program the coming season. ""When I came here, there was nothing planned for various reasons,"" he said. ""Zero. That was very tough."" Despite the rush, he has programmed a respectable list of artists, including Miguel Gutierrez, Ann Liv Young, Neal Medlyn and Jen Rosenblit. In February, the Live Ideas festival will shift its focus from a single artist to a region: This season is the Middle East and North Africa. Before Live Arts, Mr. Kriegsmann was president of ArKtype, a management and production agency he formed in 2006 that books work in the performing arts with an emphasis in theater. He has stepped down to avoid a conflict of interest with his Live Arts position, but remains a consultant. ""I've had to end certain relationships in order to make sure that there's no appearance of favoritism or interest cited to that work,"" he said.

If Mr. Kriegsmann, who stressed that Live Arts is ""definitely about dance and movement,"" has a primary mission, it's this: Being ""a midsize experimental institution that supports the development of new work tirelessly with a resident company at the helm,"" he said. He added: ""I think it's an evolution for venues in the United States to function that way. There are a few models of that in Europe, but there are too few in America."" But how does an American organization, lacking European subsidies, pay for such an evolution? Mr. Kriegsmann was vague. In an email, he said that ""pushing presenters to utilize their resources in a more supportive way has been my daily practice as a nonprofit producer for years"" and that each project ""required unique support models via partnerships that aligned best with the artist's vision."" Since Mr. Kriegsmann is not able to provide specifics yet, it's difficult to grasp what Live Arts will do that's so different from other experimentally minded New York institutions like the Kitchen or Danspace Project, which are both committed to developing new work. (Neither has a resident company.) ""I just believe there's another level of support that can happen,"" Mr. Kriegsmann said. ""I think there's a longer-term level of support that could and should happen with a venue, and I think it's particularly relevant to the dance field."" This year, Live Arts has named Okwui Okpokwasili as its resident commissioned artist, a two-year program that includes nearly $200,000 in support. Ms. Okpokwasili, whose award-winning ""Bronx Gothic"" was developed extensively at Danspace, where it was first performed, will create a new piece and revise ""Bronx Gothic."" ""Who knows if there's more audience for the piece?"" he said. ""We know that it's important for her to do and that it's important for us to do it."" Mr. Jones, in a statement, said that Live Arts was not so much changing its direction as evolving. ""The role of the artist in society is constantly shifting and being re-evaluated,"" he said. ""Tommy and I are in search of how that role is true to our era now."" He gravitated toward Mr. Kriegsmann because of the new director's love of adventurous art, along with his ""firsthand knowledge of production."" Mr. Kriegsmann, who is married to Shanta Thake, the director of Joe's Pub, is fond of using the word ""risk"" when he talks about programming. ""It's really important that we encourage ambition as far as we possibly can,"" he said.

So what identity will he imprint on Live Arts? You can glean something about Mr. Kriegsmann and his taste from his upbringing. He was raised in New Jersey in an artistic environment; his grandfather was James J. Kriegsmann, who photographed actors and musicians beginning in the 1930s; from the age of 15 or 16, he traveled to New York to see performances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, where Pina Bausch and William Forsythe were among his favorites. From there, he discovered Dancenoise, Eric Bogosian and others that, as he fondly put it, rattled him. ""When something feels clear or obvious, I no longer feel interested,"" he said. ""I'm definitely attracted to the danger of things.""","Mr. Kriegsmann, the director of programs, discusses his vision for Live Arts as the first dance performance of his inaugural season begins on Wednesday.",cf32e914-237e-5a86-ad60-5bed4d686d3a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/09/07/arts/07KRIEGSMANN/07KRIEGSMANN-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=ec7dab2fe0599fd48ce10abf70fa0c00622ff93446461e1bbcd045bb6c3f5fbc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""It's really important that we encourage ambition as far as we possibly can.""

Fashion & Style,The Revelations of Grace Wales Bonner,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/fashion/grace-wales-bonner-london.html,"LONDON -- On the outside of the envelope that contained the invitation to Grace Wales Bonner's fall show were stamped a few lines by the American writer Ishmael Reed: ""I had no systematic way of learning but proceeded like a quilt maker, a patch of knowledge here a patch there but lovingly knitted. I would hungrily devour the intellectual scraps and leftovers of the learned.""

Ms. Wales Bonner's own method is much the same. She is more serious, and her approach more scholarly, than many of her compatriots . Since her breakout collection in 2015, she has been patching her way toward a grand theory of style that connects fashion to history, to art and to black culture.

For her move to London Fashion Week from the smaller London men's wear week where she previously has shown, she had an enviable venue: The Serpentine Sackler Gallery, where ""A Time for New Dreams,"" a show she curated with the gallery, has just been extended through March 17.

The show and her fall collection were meant to be of a piece, one complementing the other. On Sunday night, when guests gathered to see it, a man was seated at the piano, playing softly: Mr. Reed.

Travel,In Milan for Fashion Week? Here's What to Do,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/17/travel/in-milan-for-fashion-week-heres-what-to-do.html,"Fashion is always central to life in Milan, and never so much as during Fashion Week, which begins on Jan. 17 with the fall/winter 2015 men's wear. But there is more to do in the city, Italy's second largest, than gaze at models with chiseled cheekbones, in well-tailored suits (not to imply that activity ever becomes tiring, of course).

Milan, our top choice in the list of 52 Places to Go in 2015, will host the 2015 World Expo, from May through October, and parts of the city still resemble construction zones in preparation for it. Alongside these urban development projects, old structures of various stripes -- among them a foundry, a bank and a farmhouse -- have recently been repurposed as bars, shops, restaurants and cultural centers. The New York Times recently spent 36 Hours in Milan, dining in a former sawmill, admiring artworks at the Gallerie d'Italia Piazza Scala and scavenging designer wear in fanciful shops like Nonostante Marras, and found an energy coursing through this thoroughly Italian yet outward-looking city that is likely to last long after the Expo.

All-in-one shopping can be found at La Rinascente, which stocks its floors with everything from kitchen tools and pastas to handbags, clothes and footwear. Also eclectic, though on the higher end, Osanna Visconti sells cast-bronze furniture as well as jewelry she creates with the help of her daughter, Madina.

Travel,"Elena Ferrante's Naples, Then and Now",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/17/travel/elena-ferrante-naples.html,"The historic center of Naples drips with Old World charm -- faded laundry strung between buildings, fish shops spilling tubs of clams and eels onto the sidewalk, pasticcerie tucked near Renaissance churches. But I was looking for something else. I had come to Naples without a guidebook or even a map, in search of a disheveled neighborhood of ""flaking walls"" and ""scratched doors,"" where the ""wretched grey"" of the buildings clashed with the passion and repression of the characters of the writer Elena Ferrante. Armed only with her series of Neapolitan novels, I was in search of a city that -- through four weighty volumes, best sellers both in the United States and Italy -- had become a character itself: dangerous, dirty and seductive, the place everyone yearns to leave behind, and the place they can't shake. As I discovered during a visit in September, the series of books offered a unique view of this complicated city, leading me away from popular tourist sites and helping to explain the city's social, economic and geographic divisions. To view the Naples of Ms. Ferrante is to view Naples like a native.

Recently, the Italian investigative journalist Claudio Gatti attempted to unmask Ms. Ferrante, claiming that numerous financial and real estate records identify the author as the Italian translator, Anita Raja. The reaction from the author's fans was passionate, with many condemning Mr. Gatti for invading the author's privacy. Ms. Ferrante's publisher declined to confirm or deny Gatti's speculations. Their official biography, however, refers to Ferrante as a woman, and offers a single personal detail: ""Elena Ferrante was born in Naples."" The quartet of novels -- which also includes ""The Story of a New Name,"" ""Those Who Leave and Those Who Stay"" and ""The Story of the Lost Child"" -- traces the lives of Elena Greco and Raffaella Cerullo, two girls from a dismal Naples rione, a neighborhood characterized by poverty, Mafia vendettas, and violence. Born weeks apart in August 1944, the girls -- who call each other Lenu and Lila -- are best friends and fierce competitors, each spurring the other to stunning academic achievement. Lenu, cautious and conscientious, eventually escapes the neighborhood through diligent study (and exchanges her childhood nickname for her given name, Elena). Lila, impulsive and daring, blazes through life, eyes narrowed to cracks, a ""terrible, dazzling girl"" who pushes Lenu to audacious acts -- as on the day the pair skip school and, for the first time in their young lives, try to ""cross the boundaries of the neighborhood"" to discover an invisible presence, ""a vague bluish memory"": the sea. As I strolled west along a narrow street in the historic center, eyes blinded by the late-afternoon sun, with the closely set buildings hemming in the sight of sky and smells of cooking, the sea felt distant indeed. My friend, Paola, said to me: ""We call this Spaccanapoli. It means Naples split in half.""

Like many ancient Roman cities, she explained, Naples had been planned along parallel decumanus, roads with an east-west orientation. This particular street cuts through the city's heart. ""The farther east you go,"" Paola, a native Napolitana, said, ""the poorer the neighborhoods."" I walked a block or two, and the Gulf of Naples flashed before me, all turquoise twinkle. Was it plausible that 10-year-old Lenu and Lila could have gone their whole lives without glimpsing this port city's defining feature? The answer, I knew, lay beyond the tourist district, in the shabby streets of their rione. With the help of Irene Caselli, a Naples native and journalist now based in Buenos Aires, I had come close to identifying their neighborhood: it was almost certainly the Rione Luzzatti. But, she warned me: ""It has a dangerous, dirty reputation. Don't go after dark. Don't walk alone."" Rione Luzzatti is bordered to the east by the central train station and to the north by a prison, Poggioreale. ""It's not so far,"" said Paola -- in fact, it's less than five miles from the historic center -- ""but it's a mental distance."" Given the area's reputation for crime, I hired a local guide, Francesca Siniscalchi, who, like virtually all the women I met in Naples, is an avid Ferrante fan.

""Her portrayal of Naples isn't just a postcard -- it's a mosaic of strong, disruptive emotions,"" Ms. Siniscalchi said of the books. ""She gives an excellent description of all the opportunities lost by every single generation in the south of Italy. When I finished the last book, I cried."" In the Rione Luzzatti, we found a cluster of dingy, dirt-streaked buildings, their narrow windows curtained by laundry, patches of unkempt grass, litter-strewn sidewalks empty despite the late-summer sunshine. Voices clashed deep within one of the apartment buildings, a hint that people were home and, perhaps, watching us. The bar-pastry shop and shoemaker from the books were missing; a fruit-and-vegetable vendor displayed wares from a truck instead of a horse-drawn cart. But despite these small differences, I needed no leap of imagination to see Elena and Lila's neighborhood. Here in this ""dim and distant rock pile"" of ""indistinguishable urban debris,"" the sea did seem like a fantasy. After the rione, the glossy elegance of Chiaia, the city's well-heeled shopping district, hit me like the blow of a stick. As teens, Elena and Lila's first foray here leaves them astonished by the chic women who seem ""to have breathed another air,"" Ms. Ferrante writes, ""to have learned to walk on wisps of wind."" Though the outing ends in violence, when a pack of wealthy boys calls their group ""hicks"" and a bloody fight ensues, these streets play a role throughout the series -- the luxurious yin to the rione's desolate yang.

After wandering down the Via Chiaia amid a crowd of stylish locals, I paused at Piazza dei Martiri to look for Solara, the shoe shop Lila decorates with a gigantic, disfigured copy of her bridal portrait, creating an artistic image of her body ""cruelly shredded."" Instead I found a Salvatore Ferragamo boutique and, across the majestic plaza, the Feltrinelli bookshop, displaying stacks of Ms. Ferrante's books. As Elena and Lila advance from girlhood to middle age, they face an era of tumultuous social upheaval -- radical feminism, 1968 demonstrations, friends who dabble in militant Communism -- and their youthful hope eventually turns to disillusionment. ""I've felt the same way -- guilty, self-critical,"" Annamaria Palermo, a professor at the University of Naples ""L'Orientale,"" told me. We were in her airy apartment, surrounded by book-lined walls, terra-cotta tile floors, and large windows framing views of the Gulf of Naples. ""In 1968, we had so many feelings of power. I was sure we would change everything."" Ms. Palermo was born in 1943, one year before Ms. Ferrante's protagonists, to a bourgeois Naples family. Still, she identified with the books. ""There is a Neapolitanness that cuts through social levels. She communicates this very well. These novels go deep into our souls,"" she said. ""I am very attached to this city, but it is like the mermaid of Capri -- something enchanting you, but something disgusting you inside,"" she said, referring to the sirens from ""The Odyssey,"" who bewitched sailors to death with their sweet songs.",The anonymous author's novels can serve as a sort of guidebook to modern Naples.,854584f8-86cd-5ee0-8209-ee5e4394e1d4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/17/travel/17NAPLES/17NAPLES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5eac1256a74a1c26b678da62c52e3182b2ec2b42ee93cfa808da5063bb723052&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mount Vesuvius looms over Naples.

Style,Sephora Will Shut Down for an Hour of Diversity Training Tomorrow,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/04/style/sephora-will-shut-down-for-an-hour-of-diversity-training-tomorrow.html,"In 2015, the beauty retailer Sephora made its brand tagline ""Let's Beauty Together,"" switching away from a prior mantra, ""The Beauty Authority."" Its senior vice president for marketing and brand, Deborah Yeh, explained the tagline several years later: ""Beauty is diverse and has many voices and faces,"" she said. ""We believe it's for our clients to define and for us to celebrate.""

In late April, the R&B star SZA, who is black (and has said she worked at Sephora before she made it as a musician), reported that a Sephora employee in Calabasas, Calif., had ""called security to make sure I wasn't stealing."" The news threatened to upset that carefully honed, diversity-focused image, which has resonated with the brand's young American customers.

On Wednesday, Sephora will close all of its stores in order to host a ""one-hour inclusivity workshop"" for employees at retail locations, distribution centers and corporate offices in the United States. The brand announced these plans in the caption of a Facebook video several weeks ago. Separately, the brand apologized to SZA, and said it was ""working with our teams to address the situation immediately.""

The training comes in tandem with the release of a Sephora ""manifesto,"" entitled ""We Belong to Something Beautiful,"" that is meant to outline the brand's commitment to championing diversity and self-expression. ""While it is true that SZA's experience occurred prior to the launch of the 'We Belong to Something Beautiful' campaign, the campaign was not the result of this Tweet,"" said a statement released by Sephora. ""However, it does reinforce why belonging is now more important than ever."" The company had been planning the one-hour workshop for its 16,000 employees for more than six months, the statement explained.","In April, R&B star SZA said a Sephora employee called security to monitor her.

Theater,"Review: In 'The Saintliness of Margery Kempe,' a Comically Restless Mystic",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/theater/the-saintliness-of-margery-kempe-review.html,"To write a memoir, first you have to take yourself seriously -- to consider your life worth scrutinizing, your thoughts worth passing along. That's maybe not such a high bar to clear in this confessional, self-obsessed age, but for a woman in the 15th century? Rather unusual, especially if the writer in question didn't know how to read.

When the English mystic Margery Kempe set down her observations and adventures in ""The Book of Margery Kempe,"" she apparently dictated it. And when you watch John Wulp's ""The Saintliness of Margery Kempe,"" a curiosity of a comedy inspired by the memoir, you know that this is something its grand, restless, flailingly ambitious heroine absolutely would do.

The great Frances Sternhagen played Margery in the original Off Broadway production, in 1959, opposite Gene Hackman as her put-upon husband, John. The delightful news about Austin Pendleton's uneven revival at the Duke on 42nd Street, starring Andrus Nichols as Margery and Jason O'Connell as John, is that the standard for those roles hasn't slipped a millimeter. Both veterans of the theater company Bedlam, these are actors whose names on a cast list are a tipoff: If they're in it, exciting performances are likely afoot.

From the moment we meet Margery, bristling with anger, and John, who soon shifts from placating her to suggesting an exorcism, Ms. Nichols and Mr. O'Connell are delicious to watch. I kept wanting to put them in a Charles Ludlam play.","A play based on a confessional, self-obsessed woman's memoir — from the 15th century — is back, at the Duke.",d8dea7de-5c00-5147-ae2d-799220525ed4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/04/arts/04saintliness/02saintliness-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a15a0a8bb839cfc13803d2bf30c9ae3a41b2d5217024b5689ecf4a7724d243d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Andrus Nichols and Jason O&rsquo;Connell in &ldquo;The Saintliness of Margery Kempe,&rdquo; directed by Austin Pendleton.",d8dea7de-5c00-5147-ae2d-799220525ed4,N24News/imgs/d8dea7de-5c00-5147-ae2d-799220525ed4.jpg,10
Science,"Relax, the Terminator Is Far Away",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/26/science/darpa-robotics-challenge-terminator.html,"In glossy sci-fi movies like ""Ex Machina"" and ""Chappie,"" robots move with impressive -- and frequently malevolent -- dexterity. They appear to confirm the worst fears of prominent technologists and scientists like Elon Musk, Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates, who have all recently voiced alarm over the possible emergence of self-aware machines out to do harm to the human race. ""I don't understand why some people are not concerned,"" Mr. Gates said in an interview on Reddit. ""I think we should be very careful about artificial intelligence,"" Mr. Musk said during an interview at M.I.T. ""If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it's probably that,"" he added. He has also said that artificial intelligence would ""summon the demon."" And Mr. Hawking told the BBC that ""the development of full artificial intelligence could spell the end of the human race."" Not so fast. Next month, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, a Pentagon research arm, will hold the final competition in its Robotics Challenge in Pomona, Calif. With $2 million in prize money for the robot that performs best in a series of rescue-oriented tasks in under an hour, the event will offer what engineers refer to as the ""ground truth"" -- a reality check on the state of the art in the field of mobile robotics.

A preview of their work suggests that nobody needs to worry about a Terminator creating havoc anytime soon. Given a year and a half to improve their machines, the roboticists, who shared details about their work in interviews before the contest in June, appear to have made limited progress. The agile robots in films like ""Ex Machina"" are far ahead of reality. In the previous contest in Florida in December 2013, the robots, which were protected from falling by tethers, were glacially slow in accomplishing tasks such as opening doors and entering rooms, clearing debris, climbing ladders and driving through an obstacle course. (The robots had to be placed in the vehicles by human minders.) Reporters who covered the event resorted to such analogies as ""watching paint dry"" and ""watching grass grow."" This year, the robots will have an hour to complete a set of eight tasks that would probably take a human less than 10 minutes. And the robots are likely to fail at many. This time they will compete without belays, so some falls may be inevitable. And they will still need help climbing into the driver's seat of a rescue vehicle.

Twenty-five teams are expected to enter the competition. Most of their robots will be two-legged, but many will have four legs, several will have wheels, and one ""transformer"" is designed to roll on four legs or two. That robot, named Chimp by its designers at Carnegie Mellon University, will weigh 443 pounds. None of the robots will be autonomous. Human operators will guide the machines via wireless networks that will occasionally slow to just a trickle of data, to simulate intermittent communications during a crisis. This will give an edge to machines that can act semi-autonomously, for example, automatically walking on uneven terrain or grabbing and turning a door handle to open a door. But the machines will remain largely helpless without human supervisors. Robots in films like ""Chappie"" are capable of great destruction. In real-world contests, state-of-the-art robots struggle simply to remove debris. ""The extraordinary thing that has happened in the last five years is that we have seemed to make extradorinary progress in machine perception,"" said Gill Pratt, the Darpa program manager in charge of the Robotics Challenge. Pattern recognition hardware and software has made it possible for computers to make dramatic progress in computer vision and speech understanding. In contrast, Dr. Pratt said, little headway has been made in ""cognition,"" the higher-level humanlike processes required for robot planning and true autonomy. As a result, both in the Darpa contest and in the field of robotics more broadly, there has been a re-emphasis on the idea of human-machine partnerships. ""It is extremely important to remember that the Darpa Robotics Challenge is about a team of humans and machines working together,"" he said. ""Without the person, these machines could hardly do anything at all."" In fact, the steep challenge in making progress toward mobile robots that can mimic human capabilities is causing robotics researchers worldwide to rethink their goals. Now, instead of trying to build completely autonomous robots, many researchers have begun to think instead of creating ensembles of humans and robots, an approach they describe as co-robots or ""cloud robotics.""

Ken Goldberg, a University of California, Berkeley, roboticist, has called on the computing world to drop its obsession with singularity, the much-ballyhooed time when computers are predicted to surpass their human designers. Rather, he has proposed a concept he calls ""multiplicity,"" with diverse groups of humans and machines solving problems through collaboration. While Jonathan Harris could school The Robot on ""Lost In Space"" in fine art, today's robots have difficulty opening doors. For decades, artificial-intelligence researchers have noted that the simplest tasks for humans, such as reaching into a pocket to retrieve a quarter, are the most challenging for machines. ""The intuitive idea is that the more money you spend on a robot, the more autonomy you will be able to design into it,"" said Rodney Brooks, an M.I.T. roboticist and co-founder two early companies, iRobot and Rethink Robotics. ""The fact is actually the opposite is true: The cheaper the robot, the more autonomy it has."" For example, iRobot's Roomba robot is autonomous, but the vacuuming task it performs by wandering around rooms is extremely simple. By contrast, the company's Packbot is more expensive, designed for defusing bombs, and must be teleoperated or controlled wirelessly by people. The first Darpa challenge more than a decade ago had a big effect on the perception of robots. It also helped spark greater interest in the artificial intelligence and robotics industries.","Despite the warnings of visionaries like Stephen Hawking and Bill Gates, today's artificial intelligence is still tethered to human controllers.",f697884f-b418-5eec-821d-22620463aa98,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/26/science/26ROBOTS3/26ROBOTS3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=c33bb83ff9ee16a9cdf98801f26dca73ad83f035ad0209b880c528fdc340eb7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A robotics contest aims to provide a reality check on the rise of machines like this one from ""Terminator Genisys.""",f697884f-b418-5eec-821d-22620463aa98,N24News/imgs/f697884f-b418-5eec-821d-22620463aa98.jpg,2

The company studied a random sample of 70,000 users who had logged in at least three times within the same month. It found that women who sent the first message were 2.5 times more likely to receive a response than men who did the same. And the men the women contacted were more ""attractive,"" as determined by how other users rate the men's profiles for both looks and content.

OkCupid, which said it has 1.5 men for every woman on the site, said both men and women are aspirational in whom they approach -- men send messages to women 17 percentage points more ""attractive"" than themselves, while women send messages to men 10 percentage points higher. So a woman who simply sifts through her inbox is most likely fielding entreaties from men less attractive than she is, while she's most likely to get a response if she contacts a more attractive man.

About 12 percent of first messages men send turn into a date, while 30 percent of women's first messages end up in a date, the site said. And yet, men send 3.5 times as many first messages on OkCupid as women do.

Travel,A Canadian Island Where Hip Meets Historic,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/travel/prince-edward-county-canada.html,"An island roughly 30 miles across that dangles into Lake Ontario, Prince Edward County packs into a small space stunning beaches and small towns, wineries and a slew of new restaurants. A mixture of the hip and the historic, it offers a rare look at what makes Canada, Canada. Some may confuse it with Prince Edward Island, 800 miles to the east. If you're looking for Anne of Green Gables, she's not here. You can hit many of the county's attractions by driving or biking across the island on the two-lane Route 33, known as the Loyalist Parkway. Lined with some 40 archaeological sites and 125 listed heritage buildings, the Parkway is itself a kind of historic artifact. Its path follows that of the first permanent pioneer roadway that the Vermonter Asa Danforth laid down, beginning in 1798, to connect Toronto to the west and Kingston to the east. Roads and land were needed to make way for several waves of refugees, led by British soldiers loyal to George III, who had arrived, weary and penniless, after the American Revolution. To this day the county is demonstrably proud of its Loyalist past.

While Sandbanks has been the traditional tourist draw, the rest of the county is almost as pretty, carved by long reaches of water and overlaid by green hills, farm stands and small towns with thriving main streets. Permanent settlement of the area likely took place only with the arrival of the Loyalists -- before that it was a place to be traversed or navigated around, on the way to somewhere else. Most who landed were officers and soldiers from disbanded regiments, with their families. They had lost everything. The British rewarded them with land to be cleared, seed and tools. More arrived in the late 1780s, described by Lord Sydney, the British Home Secretary, who was heavily involved in the scheme to resettle the Loyalists in Canada, as ""Sufferers under the ruinous and arbitrary Laws and Constitution of the United States.""

The vestiges of the Loyalists are everywhere: the County claims to be home to the second largest collection of Loyalist architecture in North America, after Williamsburg, Va. Locals proudly describe their family trees, headed by 'United Empire Loyalists,' though technically 'UEL' is only applicable if one's family served with the British military during the Revolution. More significantly, some historians trace the rise of modern Canada to the Loyalists, their arrival signifying the shift in development of a country that was to be distinct from both the republic to the south and the British Empire overseas. These days there is migration from a different direction, with the county serving as the terminus of an eastern flyway for Toronto chefs, mixologists, hoteliers, artists and entrepreneurs. Over the past few years the county has been chaotically, bigheartedly reinvented by youthful outsiders leading a hipster cavalry charge of tourism, central to which are some 50 wineries, cideries and breweries.

Around the corner, on Main Street, is what's thought to be the oldest house on the island, built by a Daniel Reynolds in 1790. Constructed with thick gray stone, the low-slung residence has been carefully restored to the Loyalist period and remains in private hands. Open to the public is the Wellington Heritage Museum, in a former Quaker Meeting House built in 1885. Wellington also has a thriving farmer's market, testament to when the county supplied a sizable portion of Canada's fruits and vegetables. The museum describes the decades when the county's economy was dominated by some 75 canneries. Orbiting the Drake are several hip Wellington dining and drinking options. Midtown Brewing occupies a former meatpacking plant with nine of its beers on tap. La Condesa, opened in May, does great Mexican small plates and cocktails like the Zona Rosa, with tequila, grilled pineapple, jalapeno, lime, agave. Across the street is Idle Wild, which also opened this spring: an Asian fusion takeout run by a young couple working with two side-by-side electric ranges, specialties like beef and wild leek dumplings. Two doors down is one of the best bakery cafes in the county, Enid Grace, tiny, warm and full of baking smells, offering brunch and Italian deli sandwiches.

A short detour north of the Parkway, flat landscape gives way to rolling hills around Hillier, with a microclimate hosting the county's greatest concentration of wineries. Closson Chase's eye-catching purple barn is one of the oldest, justly renowned for its Chardonnays. A smaller family winery nearby is Broken Stone, with good pinot noirs and Cabernet Francs. Hinterland specializes in sparkling wines. Returning to the Parkway and continuing east, one comes to the village of Bloomfield, with its handsome, heavyset Victorian houses. Bloomfield was cleared by settlers from Dutchess County, N.Y. Many were Quakers. Running parallel to the Parkway in Bloomfield is the Millennium Trail bike path, recently upgraded to loose gravel. It traverses much of the county, roughly parallel to the Parkway. (Rentals are available at Bloomfield Bicycle.) The trail crosses farms, streams and waterfowl nesting places. The county is also a road-biker's paradise, and hosts a couple of popular cross-island events each year.

Along the main drag in a former bank is the Bloomfield Public House, open less than a year . The fare is anything but pub-like, with dishes like lamb boudin with braised fennel, or the yellow perch, caught locally. Continuing east on the Parkway is Picton, a town of 4,000, once a thriving port for timber, grain and rumrunning. Much of the land that makes up the present town was originally granted to the Ferguson clan of four Loyalist officers, a sergeant and six privates, as well as a 10-year-old who had been a member of Rogers' King's Rangers, a provincial military unit that fought with the British. In summertime Teslas arrive to cruise the Picton strip among the locals' F-150s -- it feels like a New England seaside town in July. The Marans is a wonderful new restaurant opening onto the street from the Regent which dates from 1918. The owner and chef, Guerin Sykes, serves dishes like a maki roll that incorporates local pork belly. Mr. Sykes owns a farm from which he sources most of the vegetables he uses. He praises the county's honor system, which allows chefs to quickly grab ingredients from local farms and farm stands. ""A list with prices, a calculator to add up the goodies and a jar for change. What a great way to get the freshest ingredients possible while supporting your local farmers"" he said. The town is also home to Picton's Books and Company, a rambling shop and cafe with a creaking wood floor and sleepy overfed cat that seem to be standard issue to independent bookstores worldwide.

Getting on the water Surprisingly for an island, it can sometimes be a challenge to make it out on the water in the county. Scott Walcott runs a charter sport fishing operation from the cozy Picton harbor, where ships used to take wheat and barley to upstate New York and as far as England, into the blustery Z-shaped Bay of Quinte, which wraps around the east and north shores of the county. Mr. Walcott says that this particular reach of water is ranked among the top three in North America for trophy walleye, with some fish in excess of 18 pounds. Tim and Lesley Snyder, the owners of Cabin Fever Kayak, both illustrators, moved to the county a few years ago, ""having done that whole soul-destroying Toronto thing,"" as Mr. Snyder said. He still moonlights as a syndicated political cartoonist. With watercraft manufactured locally, they launch boats from next to their barn on the Black River, a half-mile upstream from where it enters Lake Ontario. The river's source is at Milford, where large schooners were once built, a peaceful winding paddle past pretty marshland.

Just east is Lake on the Mountain. As the name implies it's a deep circle of water that sits some 200 feet above Lake Ontario, at one of the highest points in the county. Long the subject of native legends, and with no obvious source, its waters are now thought to be continually replenished by underwater fissures in the rocky bottom. It offers spectacular cliffside views of the county and the Bay of Quinte. You'll also spot the free ferry that runs from Glenora to the mainland. A ferry in one form or another has been plying the same route for more than two centuries. It marks the eastern end of the Loyalist Parkway on the island, picking up again on the mainland on the other side. 52 PLACES AND MUCH, MUCH MORE Follow our 52 Places traveler, Sebastian on Instagram as he travels the world, and discover more Travel coverage by following us on Twitter and Facebook.

Art & Design,30-Foot Painting of the K.K.K. Puts a Museum to the Test,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/arts/design/blanton-museum-vincent-valdez-ku-klux-klan-painting.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. -- The Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas at Austin knew it had a painting on its hands that required sensitivity: a 30-foot-wide panorama by the Houston-based artist Vincent Valdez that imagined a modern-day Ku Klux Klan gathering. And a string of recent art-world controversies had emphasized the need for such curatorial caution. A painting of Emmett Till's mutilated body by a white artist drew protests at last year's Whitney Biennial, and images of black people smeared with chocolate and toothpaste by another white artist angered African-Americans in St. Louis. Last September, the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis dismantled a gallows-like sculpture after Native American leaders said it evoked a mass hanging of Dakota Indians in 1862. So after acquiring Mr. Valdez's four-panel painting in 2016, the Blanton spent two years preparing for the work's public debut on July 17. To display the painting, the curators had a special gallery built with a sign warning that the work ""may elicit strong emotions."" Such warnings are relatively rare. The National Coalition Against Censorship's ""Museum Best Practices for Managing Controversy,"" endorsed by several of the country's leading museum advocacy organizations, suggests that ""written warnings or disclaimers should be informational and not prejudicial."" The museum even changed its security guards' uniforms from a somber gray to a more cheerful blue, a planned update that was expedited because of the show.

The museum's staff also gave previews of the painting to faculty, administrators and students, hoping this outreach would inoculate the museum against community criticism. Staff members consulted with more than 100 individuals and organizations, including the mayor's office, the Anti-Defamation League and the Austin Justice Coalition, an advocacy organization for people of color. But even the best-laid plans can go awry. One organization the museum did not consult until very late in the process was the Austin chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The N.A.A.C.P., since its founding in 1909, led anti-lynching campaigns in the United States among its many civil rights crusades. Carlotta Stankiewicz, the Blanton's director of marketing and communications, said a ""miscommunication among our staff"" was the reason for not contacting the organization sooner. Racial violence remains a raw subject in Texas. Earlier this month the state marked the 20th anniversary of the murder of James Byrd Jr. by white supremacists in the small East Texas town of Jasper. In December civil rights groups, including the Austin N.A.A.C.P., unveiled a plaque in East Austin memorializing three African-Americans who were lynched in the area in 1894. During a conversation in his Houston studio, Mr. Valdez said he hoped his painting, titled ""The City I,"" would remind viewers that the Klan cannot be safely relegated to the past. ""There are people in the United States of America who refuse to acknowledge that entities like the Klan exist,"" he said. ""And now we're seeing the end result.""

One of the hooded figures in the painting is looking at his iPhone; a late-model Chevy pickup truck is parked in the background. Many of the Klansmen stare directly out at the viewer. ""It's a lot easier to confront subjects like white supremacy or the Klan as evil villains,"" Mr. Valdez said. ""I'm more concerned about the notion that we all inhabit the same American landscape."" Mr. Valdez grew up on San Antonio's predominantly Mexican-American south side, where he began painting at a young age. From the beginning, he addressed social injustice in his art. A video taken by his father, a Vietnam War veteran, shows the 10-year-old boy painting a mural of bomber jets dropping napalm on black, silhouetted figures.

The Blanton's director, Simone Wicha, first encountered Mr. Valdez's work at a 2014 San Antonio exhibition of his series ""The Strangest Fruit,"" which depicts the life-size bodies of lynched Mexican-American men in contemporary dress. Mr. Valdez wanted to call attention to the thousands of Mexicans who scholars estimate were lynched in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Blanton purchased two paintings from the series, which are currently on view at the museum. Ms. Wicha viewed an unfinished version of ""The City I"" in Mr. Valdez's studio in 2016, before it was displayed at the David Shelton Gallery in Houston.

Convinced of the painting's power, Ms. Wicha helped raise $200,000 in private funds to buy it. She originally planned to unveil the painting in summer 2017, but decided to push the opening back a year after the election of President Trump. She didn't want to create the impression that the museum had purchased the painting as some kind of protest. ""It would be as if we had acquired it for a political statement, or the artist had painted it for a political statement,"" Ms. Wicha explained. The extra year also gave the museum time to engage the community. ""I just felt that with a painting like this, the subject matter it's taking on, the world we're in, we needed to be really thoughtful in how we prepared,"" Ms. Wicha said. ""Would we have done this in a different political climate? I don't know. But I can tell you that in this political climate it was the right thing to do."" To provide that historical context, the Blanton hired six gallery ""hosts,"" at least one of whom will be in the gallery at all times (in addition to the security guard) to answer questions about the painting. A video screen in the gallery will play an interview with Mr. Valdez on loop. The wall text introducing the painting was written by the curator Veronica Roberts, who estimated that she had revised its six paragraphs at least 400 times. The exhibition will be complemented by a series of talks and programs beginning Tuesday and continuing through October, as well as an in-depth website. Among all these efforts, however, the Blanton did not contact Nelson Linder, the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter president, until July 9. ""Something like this, not to call the N.A.A.C.P. is fairly ridiculous,"" Mr. Linder said. ""Out of courtesy, they should have let us take a look at it."" After being made aware by this reporter of Mr. Linder's concerns last week, Ms. Wicha invited the civil rights leader to view the painting and take part in one of the programs that will accompany the exhibition. Although Mr. Linder said he appreciated the museum's finally contacting him, he expressed reservations about the painting itself. ""I would have shown the victims,"" he said. ""Not just pictures of the Klan, but the end result of their behavior, the black folks being lynched.""

Responding to Mr. Linder's point, Mr. Valdez wrote that images of black victims of lynching are indeed ""shameful and should never be forgotten."" For his painting, he said, he was ""invoking the sinister yet very real existence of the Klan and white supremacy today, hiding in clear sight among us."" He added: ""All I wanted to do in my painting, the story I wanted to tell was: Look around you; they're still here."" Mr. Linder said he hoped the experience would encourage the Blanton to communicate better with Austin's African-American community. ""It was a lesson learned,"" he said. ""You need to look outside your walls and figure out what's going on in the community when you do these type of exhibitions."" Edmund T. Gordon, chairman of African and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Texas, was among those invited to view the painting. He expressed concern that some white supremacists might interpret the painting as a glorification of the Klan. ""There are some who will see it and take it as that,"" he said. ""That's not how I see it, and that's not how the Blanton is trying to have it be understood."" He added: ""That's why there needs to be robust contextualization about why the Blanton is showing this thing, and what the artist is trying to get at.""",The Blanton Museum of Art in Texas is wrestling with how to present Vincent Valdez's panorama of a modern-day Ku Klux Klan gathering.,2e640dd2-8c98-55f1-ab87-928fbe4cb174,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/17/arts/17klan1/17klan1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=65c4c90bdb4e2587cbc5fc1a5101c994a7c971b0a4f84106c4277e2c73a5ee01&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vincent Valdez&rsquo;s &ldquo;The City I,&rdquo; at the Blanton Museum of Art in Austin, Tex., depicts a modern-day Ku Klux Klan gathering.",2e640dd2-8c98-55f1-ab87-928fbe4cb174,N24News/imgs/2e640dd2-8c98-55f1-ab87-928fbe4cb174.jpg,14
Fashion & Style,Lynda Carter Deflects Critics of Wonder Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/22/fashion/lynda-carter-wonder-woman-united-nations.html,"Is Wonder Woman a ""pinup girl"" or a feminist icon? The question dogged a United Nations campaign that featured the superhero as a symbol of self-empowerment for girls and women. While some feminists may have felt triumphant when the United Nations announced the end of the Wonder Woman campaign this month (in an earlier New York Times article, a United Nations spokesman said that the campaign had merely run its course, and that the end had nothing to do with the uproar), one loyalist was not going to sit by as her cape was dragged through the mud: Lynda Carter, the actress who starred in the 1970s television show ""Wonder Woman."" Of the pushback that accompanied the campaign, Ms. Carter believes that some of it may be because ""the U.N. didn't put a woman in there."" The ambassadorship was announced just weeks after the United Nations passed over several women to be secretary-general. Now 65, she is preparing to pass her golden lasso to Gal Gadot, the Israeli actress who will appear in next spring's film version of ""Wonder Woman."" Ms. Carter took time from acting (including a role as the president on ""Supergirl"" and a governor in the coming film ""Super Troopers 2"") and career as a singer (she just competed a four-city tour and is recording her third studio album) to discuss the complex legacy of her Amazon princess alter ego. (This interview has been edited and condensed.)

Q. There seems to be some disagreement about what a feminist icon should look like. A. What I find interesting is that they didn't look at the larger picture. I agree that the issue of gender equality is much larger than any character is, and I understand that a comic book character should not be representative of something that is that important. I agree with that. What I disagree with is this idea about Wonder Woman. She's an iconic defender, she's archetypal. It's the ultimate sexist thing to say that's all you can see, when you think about Wonder Woman, all you can think about is a sex object. What about those skimpy outfits? Yeah, so? Superman had a skintight outfit that showed every little ripple, didn't he? Doesn't he have a great big bulge in his crotch? Hello! So why don't they complain about that? And who says Wonder Woman is ""white""? I'm half-Mexican. Gal Gadot is Israeli. The character is an Amazonian princess, not ""American."" They're trying to put her in a box, and she's not in a box. Did you ever think of your character as sexy? If you think of the '70s, that was miniskirts and bikinis. I never really thought of Wonder Woman as a super-racy character. She wasn't out there being predatory. She was saying: ""You have a problem with a strong woman? I am who I am, get over it."" I never played her as mousy. I played her being for women, not against men. For fair play and fair pay.

I still have women at airports coming up to me saying: ""Oh, you don't know what it meant to me. That show got me through this difficult time, that difficult time."" That's really where the fantasy became a reality, where Wonder Woman became something much more than a TV show or a comic book. And I'll tell you this, when women recognize me in airports, I hold them in my arms and they cry. If a guy comes up and says, ""Oh my God, I had such a crush on you when I was a teenager,"" I say: ""Talk to the hand. I don't want to know."" Wonder Woman, of course, was not your first experience being celebrated for your beauty. How did it feel to get your first burst of fame by winning the 1972 Miss World USA pageant? That's so funny. I did one beauty pageant -- one! I had been on the road as a singer, I came home, and I entered one beauty pageant. I didn't like it very much, because there was no talent in it. I just thought it was stupid. I still do. You always said that music was your first love. When you were a teenager playing in a band with Gary Burghoff [who later played Radar on ""M*A*S*H""], did you guys ever think you two would end up making it big in Hollywood? No, I was 16. We were just a local band, and then I went with another band, and another band, and finally started doing some recording, mostly jingles and some session work. I was doing some writing and plugging along, as every other girl who goes to L.A. does, and then I finally got ""Wonder Woman."" I guess ""The Flying Nun"" and ""Bewitched"" were about female characters with superhuman powers, but ""Wonder Woman"" was really a breakthrough in terms of television superheroines. Why did the show strike such a chord with girls watching at home?

At the height of your fame in the 1970s, you were voted the most beautiful woman in the world in one poll. Does that sort of thing change the way you see yourself in the mirror? I'm sure I went and looked. And I'm sure I had no makeup on and I'm sure I went, ""Huh, really?"" You have been open about your struggles with alcohol and finding sobriety. Was that all about the post-""Wonder Woman"" blues? Yes and no. I think that that was more about my bad marriage. I went through some tough times, and it brought solace at the time. But of course, that just rears its ugly head and bites you. But now it's coming up on 20 years since I've been sober. Along with your second husband, you were big figures on the D.C. social circuit. Do you still get out there the way you did?

We're still pretty active politically. Less so now than we used to be. But no. The era of Beltway parties that include both sides of the aisle, it just doesn't happen anymore. People used to talk to each other, they worked things out, they tried to get things done. They stopped talking to one another. It's just gotten so ugly. Nowadays, you are primarily a singer, and your band recently played Jazz at Lincoln Center. Tell us about your act. My band is too big to be considered a cabaret band. My band's 10 people. They're more like mini-concerts, I guess you'd call them. But I'm in the process of doing my third album. I've been writing quite a bit, and sometimes my son will say, ""Hey, Mom, you'd sound really good doing that song."" So I'll do the Lone Bellow, ""You Never Need Nobody,"" or the Black Keys. I just recently put in my show a Billie Holiday song, ""You've Changed."" This fall, you returned to the small screen playing another female superhero of sorts -- the president of the United States -- on an episode of ""Supergirl."" What was your inspiration for the role? It was Hillary. I've known Hillary Clinton for 35 years. She is the kindest, most wonderful human being. She has an infectious personality and smile and warmth and personality and true nature. She grew up in a time where you had a be a certain way to be taken seriously. Now you can be whoever you want. You don't have to be serious. You can be feminine and powerful at the same time.",A United Nations ambassadorship for the superhero spurred a battle between the actress who made her famous and those who thought her a poor role model.,94b47252-86d5-5f11-808e-4cb8f7574404,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/12/25/fashion/25WONDER1-WEB/25WONDER1-WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=3285251c73ddddb3b0210158ffabb49d3183d110ae1f98e199c72995c6780585&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman, in a still from the show's pilot episode in 1975.",94b47252-86d5-5f11-808e-4cb8f7574404,N24News/imgs/94b47252-86d5-5f11-808e-4cb8f7574404.jpg,19

Economy,A Winter-Coat Heavyweight Gives Trump's Trade War the Cold Shoulder,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/business/economy/columbia-sportswear-trump-trade-war.html,"An employee at Columbia Sportswear headquarters in Portland, Ore., uses a planimeter, a tool to measure the two-dimensional area of each material visible on the external surface area of a shoe.

Columbia Sportswear has worked around tariffs for decades -- and it says the president's new wave of levies will not bring jobs back to America.

An employee at Columbia Sportswear headquarters in Portland, Ore., uses a planimeter, a tool to measure the two-dimensional area of each material visible on the external surface area of a shoe. Such measurements are necessary to determine the customs tariff classification and duty rate.

PORTLAND, Ore. -- Columbia Sportswear has spent years designing ski jackets and hiking boots to withstand the elements: wind, rain, snow and, increasingly, tariffs. Located on a sprawling campus adorned with hanging canoes, the 80-year-old retailer has long protected its outdoor gear from the whims of Washington by engaging in what the company calls ""tariff engineering"" -- adjusting its products to lessen import taxes on materials from outside the United States like rubber soles, zippers and waterproof nylon. But now Columbia worries that its approach is under threat from a president whose trade strategy leaves little room for American companies that make and sell products globally.

At Columbia, the response is to lean heavily on the company's long experience in navigating the thicket of trade restrictions it has faced in the United States and abroad. Every fleece vest and waterproof glove stamped with the Columbia logo is manufactured abroad, and the company has come to rely on a system of pairing its designers with its team of trade experts, who recommend work-arounds that can help an item of clothing circumvent tariffs. In a conference room filled with samples, Jeffrey W. Tooze, Columbia's vice president for global customs and trade, showed how a small change in design can mean big money for a given product. The addition of a super-thin sheath of fabric to the sole of a boot or shoe can help circumvent an existing 37.5 percent tariff on rubber soles imported into America. A fabric sole, by contrast, is taxed at 12.5 percent. (Customers find that the fabric wears off within days, revealing the rubber sole beneath.)

A water-resistant jacket triggers a 7.1 percent tariff, while a jacket that has not been waterproofed gets hit with a 27.7 percent tariff. A jacket filled at least 10 percent, by weight, with down, brings about a tariff of only 4.4 percent. Those distinctions don't reflect national security or economic concerns -- they are the result of long-past lobbying campaigns intended to protect or exempt certain manufacturers. Recognizing them, and designing around them, has become part of Columbia's corporate culture since Mr. Tooze joined the company in 2001. ""It's part of the thought process, part of the creative thinking, part of the D.N.A.,"" he said. What Columbia is not doing, to any large degree, is bringing production jobs to the United States, as Mr. Trump would like. Tim Boyle, Columbia's chief executive, said in a recent interview that there was nothing the president could do to entice the company to make its products in the United States, where costs would be higher and apparel manufacturing expertise has withered through decades of outsourcing.

Mr. Boyle said the firm emulated another Oregon retailer, Nike, adopting the approach that it should ""design, market merchandise from a central location -- America, Portland, whatever -- and make it where you should make it in the world and sell it everywhere in the world."" Today, just under 40 percent of Columbia's business is outside the United States, and all of its products are made abroad. It sells heavily to Asia, Europe and Canada. It has a joint venture in China and is in the process of buying out its Chinese partner. Vietnam is its largest supplier. A quarter of its footwear comes from China.

At every turn in the supply chain, it is faced with tariffs. To import the finished products to retail stores across the United States, Columbia must navigate the remnants of a 1930 trade bill, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act. That 1930 law raised tariffs rates in an effort to protect American businesses, only to end up being blamed by later economists as a key contributor to the Great Depression. Many of its measures have been scrapped, but some remain, particularly those affecting the clothing business. In addition to imposing levies on foreign steel and aluminum, the Trump administration has placed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, while dangling the prospect of taxing all imports from China. Other countries have retaliated, including China, Europe, Canada and Mexico, taxing American-made products that flow into their countries, including apparel. So far, Columbia has gone mostly unscathed, in part because Mr. Trump's initial round of Chinese tariffs has largely avoided clothing. But the company has braced itself for the next wave, which would probably hit many of their imports, particularly Chinese-made footwear.

Columbia is preparing itself for every contingency. Among the questions the company is contemplating: Can it move products out of its factories and into stores quickly enough to beat any new tariffs before they go into effect? Can it change how it manufactures its goods -- by, say, ramping up production in Vietnam and slowing it down in China? ""We've had probably two meetings a day on that, every day, for the last two months,"" said Emily Vedaa, Columbia's global trade manager. ""How can we soften the blow?"" Mr. Trump has been unapologetic about his approach, arguing that any short-term economic pain will lead to long-term growth. He has also called out companies like Apple, telling them to move their production plants if they don't like his plan. ""Make your products in the United States instead of China. Start building new plants now. Exciting!"" Mr. Trump said in a tweet in September.

But companies like Columbia say they cannot adjust the way they do business on the fly to deal with policy changes, particularly when they are not settled. For instance, Mr. Trump has dangled the threat of additional tariffs on China while also saying a compromise could be reached. He plans to meet with President Xi Jinping of China for a high-stakes meeting at the G-20 in Buenos Aires later this month. And while the new tariffs are predicated on trade law, they have come about through executive, not congressional, action and could easily be undone by an administration that looks more kindly on global trade. Thomas B. Cusick, Columbia's chief operating officer, said the company has received its entire fall shipment already, as well as the ""lion's share"" of merchandise for the Christmas season. In addition, it has bought all its products for next spring and reserved factory capacity for its fall 2019 line. Any changes it makes in response to moves out of Washington would not go into effect until 2020 -- and that would mean large investments that the company would make only if they were certain to pay off in the long run.

Nearly every large American retailer is in a similar situation: 98 percent of the footwear bought by Americans is made overseas, and 97 percent of clothing sold in the United States is produced in other countries. ""This migration to Asia has been happening since the '60s,"" Mr. Boyle said. ""And so everybody who made investments in machines to make fabric or extreme, you know, plastics to make nylon or any kind of textile products -- all those investments have been in Asia. All the technology."" Along with the factories, the manufacturing expertise has moved overseas. ""It's one thing to design a shirt like you're wearing,"" Mr. Boyle said. ""You can sketch that out on a piece of paper. But to make it fit somebody, that's a technical expertise in tailoring that doesn't exist here anymore. You could come up with some stuff that nobody could wear."" Mr. Boyle conceded that if Mr. Trump does hit China with more tariffs -- and Columbia is not immediately able to find a way around them -- the company will have no choice but to charge more, despite its long expertise in navigating trade winds.",Columbia Sportswear has worked around tariffs for decades — and it says the president's new wave of levies will not bring jobs back to America.,59772e06-9400-5a78-a238-3ba7c37445ba,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/24/business/24dc-Columbia-print/merlin_144246621_0f4bfa00-9ea5-4894-815c-e8de590210c2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=24c388e28d110ced9f738428e25e65714fa42e62e419840ba15938f1a3ad838e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Columbia's designers work with the firm's trade experts to mitigate the impact of tariffs.,59772e06-9400-5a78-a238-3ba7c37445ba,N24News/imgs/59772e06-9400-5a78-a238-3ba7c37445ba.jpg,8
Sports,What We Learned in the N.F.L.'s Divisional Round,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/13/sports/football/49ers-packers-chiefs-titans.html,"A week after three road teams advanced in the wild-card round, three home teams took care of business in the divisional round. The weekend featured one of the biggest upsets in recent memory -- Tennessee's 28-12 stunner over Baltimore -- but otherwise stuck to the script. That is not to say it was boring, however, with the 49ers, the Titans, the Chiefs and the Packers all making clear cases for themselves as Super Bowl contenders.
* None A little rest goes a long way. San Francisco needed a win over Seattle in Week 17 to secure a first-round bye, and getting that weekend off appears to have set the team up for an extended run in the playoffs. The 49ers had three key starters return from injuries on defense, and the difference was readily apparent on Saturday in an easy 27-10 win over Minnesota. The one area of concern? Quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo appeared to turn his ankle during the game, and was asked to do almost nothing in the second half, with the 49ers running the ball on nearly every play. Could those two things be related? And will that limitation stretch into Sunday's N.F.C. championship game against Green Bay? One bonus of the scheduling is that the 49ers, who played the early game on Saturday, will have the longest rest of any of the teams playing next week.
* None A lot of Patrick Mahomes goes a really long way. The Chiefs were down by 24-0 to the Texans early in the second quarter on Sunday, and Arrowhead Stadium was going through a sort of identity crisis. Everything changed when Mahomes found Damien Williams for a 17-yard touchdown pass. The stadium came alive, Mahomes seemed invigorated and Kansas City reeled off a playoff-record seven consecutive drives that ended in a touchdown -- and it added a field goal on the eighth for good measure in its 51-31 romp. Mahomes's dominance was so overwhelming that most people probably did not even notice that he had a game-high 53 rushing yards to go with his 321 passing yards and five touchdowns.
* None Derrick Henry is built for the playoffs. Henry, Tennessee's seemingly unstoppable running back, had a terrific regular season, leading the N.F.L. with 1,540 rushing yards and 16 rushing touchdowns, but that was somehow just the appetizer for a postseason in which he has already rushed for 377 yards. Over the course of two games, Henry has helped eliminate the N.F.L.'s defending champions (the New England Patriots) and the team with the best record in the regular season (the Baltimore Ravens). Tennessee has not been taking any chances, letting its workhorse run the ball a combined 64 times, but Henry still has a long way to go if he wants to set a record for rushing yards in a single postseason: John Riggins had 610 yards over the course of four postseason games after the 1982 season, including 166 in the Washington Redskins' win in Super Bowl XVII.
* None Beware of Mr. & Mr. Smith. For the most part, you know what you're going to get with the Green Bay Packers. Aaron Rodgers is going to knock your socks off with a few deep passes, Davante Adams is going to be on the receiving end of most of those passes, and in an added wrinkle this season, Aaron Jones is going to celebrate a touchdown on an inordinate number of plays -- he did it 19 times during the regular season, and two more times on Sunday. But as the Packers demonstrated in Sunday's win over Seattle, Za'Darius and Preston Smith (no relation) have truly changed what you can expect from Green Bay on defense. They combined for 25.5 sacks during the regular season, and they each added two more on Sunday. It was Preston's second that was the most important, as he crushed Russell Wilson to the turf late in the fourth quarter, ending a drive that could have resulted in Seattle's taking the lead. The huge stop allowed Green Bay to preserve its 28-23 victory.
* None Absolutely nothing about Lamar Jackson's record-breaking season changes. Jackson set an N.F.L. record for a quarterback with 1,206 rushing yards, led the league with 36 touchdown passes and guided Baltimore to a 13-2 record in his 15 starts. He was so popular among opponents that it became a regular occurrence for them to line up after games with jerseys for him to sign -- despite his having just demolished their team. If people try to take a loss to the red-hot Tennessee Titans, combine it with last year's playoff loss to the Chargers, and turn that into something about Jackson not being able to perform when the pressure is on, they will need to find a new victim. Jackson came back stronger from last season's defeat, and after he picks up his Most Valuable Player Award on Feb. 1, he can set about coming back even stronger in the 2020 season.

Passing was cool again this week. While the four wild-card games produced a total of six passing touchdowns, this weekend's action had 16 in the same number of games, with Mahomes contributing five. His statistics were eye-popping, but the fact that he did not give up when his team was down by 24-0 was even more impressive.

Tennessee passed the ball far more than people realize during the regular season, but in the playoffs, the Titans are trusting in Henry, and he is rewarding that trust. His 195 rushing yards on Saturday was the ninth-highest total in a playoff game since at least 1950, and resulted in his breaking the Titans-Oilers franchise playoff record for a second consecutive week. He also threw his first career touchdown pass.

Choosing between Adams and Kansas City's Travis Kelce is nearly impossible, as both had huge days, but Adams gets the nod because of how vital he was to Green Bay's victory. He accounted for 66 percent of Aaron Rodgers's passing yards, caught both of the team's touchdown passes and had a crucial 32-yard catch late in the fourth quarter to help ice the win. Kelce was just as productive, but he had far more help.

49ers 27, Vikings 10 San Francisco's commitment to the hot hand at running back is extreme: Tevin Coleman led the 49ers with 102 rushing yards and two touchdowns on Saturday after not having had more than 40 yards in any game since Week 8 -- when he had 105 rushing yards and four total touchdowns. Will Coleman get the ball again next week? Will Raheem Mostert? Is it Matt Breida's turn? Not even they know. Titans 28, Ravens 12 Ryan Tannehill threw for fewer than 100 yards for a second consecutive week, but it would be inaccurate to say that Tennessee's second win of the playoffs was all Derrick Henry's doing. Tannehill, playing in his second career playoff game, contributed two passing touchdowns -- one of which went for 45 yards -- and also ran for a score.","The Titans pulled off a stunning upset, the Chiefs won in a blowout, the 49ers got healthy and the Packers survived a comeback attempt.

Art & Design,"When Dealers, Too, Were Romantics",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/arts/design/dick-bellamy-green-gallery.html,"""Dealers are as important as the artists themselves,"" the gallery owner Leo Castelli once said. ""He cannot exist without us, and we cannot exist without him."" Gendered language aside, Castelli's remark captures the fragile symbiosis between those who make art and those who sell it. Lately, however, dealers have been having trouble keeping up their end of this relationship -- that is to say, just existing. Each month seems to bring a new closing announcement from an adventurous small or midsize gallery hobbled by, among other things, rising rents and multiplying art-fair expenses. In August, for instance, the dealer Jean-Claude Freymond-Guth circulated a candid letter announcing the demise of his nine-year-old Zurich gallery -- citing, in place of the usual moving-on platitudes, ""the consequences for art in an increasingly polarizing society ultimately built on power, finance and exclusion."" Into this anxious moment comes a wistfully romantic portrait of the postwar dealer Richard Bellamy, a passionate advocate for contemporary art and a notably indifferent businessman. ""Deadeye Dick: Richard Bellamy and His Circle,"" at Peter Freeman, Inc., lionizes Bellamy and his bohemian milieu -- emphasizing the brief early-1960s tenure of the Green Gallery he founded on West 57th Street -- while inviting some cleareyed judgments about the realities of running a gallery today.

Bellamy, who died in 1998 at 70, saw himself not as an entrepreneur, but as ""an observer who just happens to be in a position to give exhibitions to people."" Yet his best years were, as Mr. Freeman recalled during the show's installation, ""the moment when the art market as we know it today came to be.""

Speculative collecting, artist-poaching and frothy press coverage were as much signs of the times as Bellamy's thrift-store outfits, afternoon benders and unheated Lower East Side apartments. The Green Gallery would not have been in business without the backing of the taxi magnate Robert Scull and his wife, Ethel, who would scandalize the art world a decade or so later with a high-profile auction of works from their contemporary art collection that looked like greedy profit-taking to the artists they had supported. (""Deadeye Dick"" nods to the Sculls in a set of mischievously Warholesque portraits by Michael Heizer.) Organized by Judith Stein, whose evocative biography of Bellamy, ""Eye of the Sixties,"" was published last year along with a collection of the his correspondence edited by his son Miles, the show is a vivid affirmation of Bellamy's ""eye."" If the book, which delves into his drinking and his troubled relationships, can make him seem like a tragically contrarian figure -- ""the wrong man at the right time,"" as the painter Larry Poons put it -- the exhibition lets us judge him on the merits of his discoveries.

They include Donald Judd, Dan Flavin and Claes Oldenburg, who all made their New York solo debuts at the Green. They're represented at Freeman by audacious early works like Mr. Oldenburg's ""Giant Blue Men's Pants"" from his 1962 outing, a pair of enormous painted-canvas slacks casually draped over a hanger; and Mr. Flavin's 1964 light piece ""a primary picture,"" made of red, yellow and blue fluorescent bulbs arranged to resemble an empty frame. ""Deadeye Dick"" almost makes you feel like you're encountering these pieces for the first time -- a rare feat, given the current blue-chip status of these artists and their hushed presentation in big museums and mega-galleries.

Other, less familiar names are given equal billing, which is heartening because it would have been all too easy to convene a winners-only exhibition. A 1956 wood, gravel and metal relief painting by Jean Follett (one of few women on the Green roster) makes an earthy, Jean Dubuffet-like impact. And the painter and critic Sidney Tillim pays tribute to his fellow art writer Clement Greenberg in his mysterious allegory ""Who Among Us Really Knows? Or Greenberg's Doubt,"" from 1969. Portraits of Bellamy are here too, attesting to his intensity and charisma. He sat for Alex Katz in a kind of attentive slouch, head cocked just slightly and shoulders askew. Not here, alas, is Roy Lichtenstein's painting of a military officer musing in a speech bubble: ""I am supposed to report to a Mr. Bellamy. I wonder what he's like.""

How might we characterize Bellamy's taste, on the basis of ""Deadeye Dick""? Early works by Robert Morris, Richard Serra, Bruce Nauman and Mark di Suvero (the subject of the Green's first solo, and one of just a handful of artists Bellamy represented at the time of his death) evince an intuitive response to sculpture. His painting sensibilities are harder to define, with bracingly austere abstract works by Mary Corse, Myron Stout and Jo Baer offset at Freeman by the helter-skelter figuration of Jan Muller's ""Temptation of Saint Anthony"" (1957). A selection of ephemera confirms that Bellamy was way out front in fostering participatory and performative projects like Oldenburg's pop-up ""Store"" on the Lower East Side (1961) and the duo of Tehching Hsieh and Linda Montano's ""Art/Life One Year Performance"" (1983-4), conducted partly in Bellamy's final gallery venture, Oil & Steel, which began in TriBeCa. When it came to closing deals, however, Bellamy lagged behind contemporaries like Sidney Janis and Castelli. ""There was no real thinking about the business aspect, or what a stable of artists means, or what a dealer does to promote them apart from sitting there and trying to sell a painting every time someone asks the price of it,"" Bellamy later acknowledged. Often in the Green Gallery years, Ms. Stein writes, he wasn't even ""sitting there""; he was napping in the back room, or out at a bar, having taken the gallery's phones off the hook.","An ambitious show salutes Richard Bellamy, who fostered Jo Baer, Donald Judd, Bruce Nauman and Claes Oldenburg, among many others.",abd84be4-41a2-5f54-b824-e647e882ef29,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/15/arts/15bellamy-katz/15bellamy-katz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f024dfab80833ec58f12b2b59adc79450e6eeba6a97064a1159476a6b5043dad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Alex Katz's portrait of Richard Bellamy.,abd84be4-41a2-5f54-b824-e647e882ef29,N24News/imgs/abd84be4-41a2-5f54-b824-e647e882ef29.jpg,14
Music,Will Jarring Music Drive Drug Users From a German Train Station?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/22/arts/music/atonal-music-deutsche-bahn-drugs-trains.html,"In public transit stations from London to New York you often hear the sound of gentle classical music -- some Mozart perhaps, maybe some Bach. It's piped in as an easy way to calm angry passengers, and discourage teenagers from hanging around.

But now, Deutsche Bahn -- Germany's national train operator -- has come up with a different, slightly more confrontational approach. This autumn, it will try piping ""atonal music"" into a Berlin railway station, a spokesman confirmed Wednesday in an emailed statement. It is an attempt to make the station less comfortable for drug users.

In explaining the move, an official told the publication Deutsche Welle that few people find such music beautiful, and that many perceive it as something to run away from.

Deutsche Bahn was unable to give any further details of the trial program, which was first reported in Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper. It had yet to decide what pieces of music to use. It will not play the music on platforms and risk annoying passengers waiting for trains, the spokesman said.","Germany's national train operator will start playing atonal music in a Berlin station to deter antisocial behavior. It just may deter passengers, too.",5a3d7785-7f20-5d3d-b103-072a6a8bb10a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/23/arts/23atonal-item/23atonal-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d497d149d4e64f886d4160b5d31f7ae904e12075b3a41ee4a3bcf6e3fffcbe62&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Berlin Hermannstrasse U-bahn underground BVG railway station platform.

Food,"Aligoté, Burgundy's Other White Grape, Makes Its Case",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/06/dining/white-wine-burgundy-aligote.html,"Jean-Marc Roulot's grape plots. Mr. Roulot has about two acres of aligote vines, planted decades ago by his grandfather.

MARSANNAY, France -- In a cramped cellar under a courtyard in this small town on the northern edge of Burgundy, Sylvain Pataille drew a sample of a 2016 white wine from an old barrel and filled our glasses. The wine was young and a bit cloudy, but its energy and breadth were already evident, with flavors of citrus, herbs and, above all, a penetrating, stony minerality. It was delicious. ""I adore the precise terroir expression of aligote,"" Mr. Pataille said. Though he is best known for making exceptional Marsannay reds, Mr. Pataille has begun to explore the potential of aligote, the almost forgotten third grape of Burgundy. The great reds and whites of Burgundy, made of pinot noir and chardonnay, are among the most coveted and expensive wines in the world. But aligote?

Few grapes have been as scorned in the last 50 years. Aligote is often described as thin, acidic and insipid, capable of nothing better than serving as the base for kir, in which white wine is flavored with creme de cassis. For the last two years, I have had so many delicious aligotes that I traveled to Burgundy in an effort to understand why the wines were not more appreciated. Since 2013, Mr. Pataille has been bottling separate cuvees of aligote, planted in some of his best plots, to demonstrate how well it can transmit the character of a place. ""Aligote expresses terroir almost more than chardonnay,"" he said. Many of Burgundy's most revered names, including cherished estates like Leroy and Coche-Dury, Roulot and Ramonet, Lafarge and d'Angerville, de Villaine and Ponsot, persist in growing aligote.

It is wonderful with food. It's great with shellfish and other seafood, and Mr. Pataille said it goes particularly well with chicken in cream sauces. I love it with pasta sauces, like pesto or white clam sauce, that would ordinarily point to an Italian white. ""It's a mouthwatering wine,"" said Frederic Lafarge, whose family, best known for its superb Volnays, has made aligote for generations. He called aligote ""a local wine, very particular to Burgundy."" The grape has been grown in Burgundy for centuries. Back in the 19th century, before the phylloxera aphid destroyed European grapevines, aligote was often intermingled with chardonnay in the best vineyards. When growers replanted, they mostly replaced aligote with chardonnay, though aligote was still found in the grand cru Corton-Charlemagne vineyard up until the 1970s. The cultural connotation of aligote may have particular meaning today in a region where newfound fame and wealth may in the long run overwhelm a culture built on the image of the community of vignerons, the small farmers who tend the vines, make the wines and know the land inside and out. Jean-Marc Roulot, best known for his Meursaults, has about two acres of aligote planted on the plain, which he maintains even though he could probably make more money if he grew chardonnay there. But the aligote vines were planted decades ago by his grandfather. ""There is no question of doing something else,"" Mr. Roulot said. ""They are in all the family stories.""

He grows the grapes organically and does the same work in the vineyard as he does with his best Meursaults. The treatment diverges in the cellar, however, where he ferments and ages aligote in steel tanks, instead of in oak, which preserve freshness rather than encouraging complexity. ""It's simple, but it has to speak of the estate,"" Mr. Roulot said. ""You don't want it to be a pretentious wine, all puffed up. It was a wine for the family and the worker. Maybe I'm a prisoner of old habits, but a simple wine is a simple wine, and there's no shame in that.""

Mr. Roulot's aligotes are textured, precise and alive. The 2014, an exceptional vintage for aligote, was fresh, linear and tangy, while the '15, a vintage in which aligote can seem a little unfocused, was nonetheless lively, chalky and refreshing. Surprisingly, his aligotes can age beautifully. He pulled out a 2007, which at 10 years of age was rich, vibrant and deep, with salty, savory flavors. ""To me, it's less recognizable as aligote,"" Mr. Roulot said. Aligote's potential may often be overlooked, even by those who make it. Burgundy worships the notion that good wine is an expression of the place and the culture that produced it. This notion of terroir is communicated on the label of every bottle of Burgundy made of pinot noir or chardonnay. For a village wine, you won't find the name of the grape, just the place where the grapes were grown -- Gevrey-Chambertin or Chassagne-Montrachet, for example. For a premier cru, one step up, a vineyard name might be added. For a grand cru, the pinnacle of the terroir hierarchy, the name of the vineyard alone suffices: La Tache, say, or Musigny.

But when the appellation system in Burgundy was set up in 1936, aligote was considered unable to express the characteristics of a place. Wines made of aligote are generically labeled Bourgogne Aligote. Partly as a result, aligote has been confined to lesser terroirs, with the best land going to more lucrative chardonnay or pinot noir. ""The best terroirs for aligote are the best terroirs, period, hillsides and limestone,"" Mr. Pataille said. There are two exceptions to the generic appellation rule. One is a small plot of aligote on the slope above the grand cru Clos de la Roche vineyard in Morey-St.-Denis. Domaine Ponsot has nursed this plot for more than a century, and it alone among aligotes in Burgundy has the right to be called a premier cru. The wine, Ponsot's Clos des Monts Luisants, sells for about $125 a bottle, far more than almost any other aligote. The 2014 had the energy and linearity typical of an aligote, yet with unexpected resonance and depth. I would love to see how it unfolds with 10 more years of aging. The other exception is aligote grown in Bouzeron, a village outside the heart of Burgundy in the Cote Chalonnaise. There, in 1971, Aubert de Villaine, the co-director of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, and his wife, Pamela, established their family estate, Domaine A. & P. de Villaine. Since 1979, Bouzeron has been the only appellation where aligote wines may use the name of the place rather than the grape.

Maintaining the best strains of aligote is just as important, Mr. de Benoist said. Much of the aligote planted in Burgundy is the vigorous aligote vert, which produces quantity rather than quality. Only the aligote dore, Mr. de Benoist and others insist, can produce good wine. In an effort to preserve this preferred strain, Mr. de Benoist has created a conservancy to maintain it. The de Villaine Bouzeron is produced with meticulous care. The grapes are grown organically, and each plot is vinified separately in large barrels before being blended into a single Bouzeron wine. These wines are particularly saline, with great texture and depth. The 2015 de Villaine had lovely concentration and saltiness, with lingering flavors of lime, herbs and minerals. Because aligote has little of the glamour of chardonnay, aligote vineyards are far less expensive to buy, providing an entry point for young winemakers without land or means. When Julien Altaber started his label, Sextant, in 2007, he could only afford to buy grapes -- not grow his own -- to make wine. In 2010, he found a plot of 70-year-old aligote near Puligny that he could afford. ""Nobody else wanted it,"" Mr. Altaber said. ""Nobody else cared. It's heritage!"" He works with minimal intervention, and has experimented with his aligotes, including a sparkling one and a gorgeous golden-colored, ginger-and-herb-flavored cuvee in which the fermented wine was left in contact with the grape skins, allowing it to develop color and texture like a red. Most producers, unlike Mr. Altaber, keep their methods simple and their ambitions low. But not Mr. Pataille in Marsannay. Along with his straightforward Bourgogne Aligote, he makes four other aligotes from distinct parcels, which he names on his labels. Champ Forey is fresh and herbal; Clos du Roy is more saline, delineated and complex; Auvonnes au Pepe is tangy, herbal and citrus; and, best of all, Charme aux Pretres is penetrating, deep, linear and mineral.

That may be true for everybody but the winemakers, who care deeply. I asked Mr. de Benoist of Domaine de Villaine a question I'd been wondering about. How did he feel making wine in Bouzeron, which some might consider a sideshow compared with exalted Romanee-Conti? ""It's rare to be able to produce the three great varieties of Burgundy,"" he said. ""I am very lucky."" Dozens of good Burgundy producers make aligote, including cult favorites like Domaine Leroy and Coche-Dury, which can run from $80 to $150. Here are 10 excellent, more reasonably priced aligotes from among the best producers who make it. Other names to seek out include Hubert Lignier, Paul Pillot, Arnaud Ente, Francois Mikulski, Comte Armand and Claire Naudin. Alice et Olivier de Moor (Louis/Dressner Selections, New York), $30.

Health,Cartilage Is Grown in the Arthritic Joints of Mice,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/22/health/arthritis-cartilage.html,"The painful knees and hips experienced by so many people with osteoarthritis result from a loss of cartilage, which serves as a sort of cushioning in the joints. It had long been thought that cartilage, once gone, cannot grow back. Now researchers at Stanford University have grown new cartilage in the joints of arthritic mice. Primitive cells that can be transformed into new cartilage lie dormant at the ends of bones, the researchers reported in Nature Medicine. The cells just have to be awakened and stimulated to grow. The researchers say the next step is to try to grow cartilage in larger animals, like dogs or pigs. They are optimistic that the finding could eventually lead to treatments to prevent the often debilitating pain that arises when cartilage erodes away. ""It is really a major advance in field of osteoarthritis,"" said Dr. Gerard Karsenty, a bone specialist at Columbia University who was not involved in the research.

Although scientists often question whether findings in mice may apply to humans, diseases of the skeleton often do, he added. ""When you demonstrate something in the mouse, I don't know of any example where it has not applied to humans,"" Dr. Karsenty said. But Dr. Robert Marx, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, cautions that the path to a treatment that helps patients may be long and unpredictable. Scientists will need to determine not only whether the method is safe and effective, but to learn which patients are likely to be helped -- those early or later in the course of arthritis -- and how long the treatment will last. An estimated 50 million Americans have osteoarthritis; the lifetime risk of getting the diagnosis is 40 percent. Once the degeneration of the cartilage lining a joint begins, there is no treatment available to restore it.

The new research was conducted with mice with knee arthritis, and with human bone transplanted into mice. Normal cartilage was grown in both settings. The mice had knee arthritis so severe they had trouble walking. After they grew new cartilage, they stopped limping and grimacing (mice are known to have facial expressions indicating pain). The study began with a discovery in 2018 by Charles Kwok Fai Chan, then a postdoctoral student at Stanford and now an assistant professor in the surgery department. He found primitive cells -- stem cells -- at the ends of bones that can give rise to cartilage, bone marrow or bone, depending on how they are stimulated. But those stem cells were not dividing or growing. Their dormancy, Dr. Chan realized, was why bone experts had assumed cartilage, once lost, could not return. The challenge was to find a way to awaken those stem cells and direct them to form cartilage. He, Dr. Michael T. Longaker, who directs the program in regenerative medicine at Stanford, and their colleagues discovered how to do so in three steps. First, the scientists slightly damaged the ends of bone by drilling tiny holes in it. This technique -- microfracture -- is sometimes used by orthopedic surgeons to relieve pain in arthritic joints. The drilling is done through a scope and the holes are minuscule. The procedure resulted in the growth of tough scar tissue, which the researchers realized had occurred because the bone's stem cells had awakened and had turned into this tough tissue. The tissue does not cushion the joint and does not last long, Dr. Longaker said. But it can help with pain, so may serve as a stopgap measure.

The researchers wanted to turn those awakened stem cells into cartilage. The recipe that worked was to treat the stem cells with bone morphogenetic protein, which is used to help fuse bones. The scientists also used a drug called Avastin, which prevents the stem cells from getting a blood supply. Unlike bone and bone marrow, cartilage has no blood supply, and the drug helped stimulate the stem cells to turn into cartilage. The investigators provided the drugs directly to the ends of bones, putting them in a gel. The cartilage that grew in the mice not only looked like normal but lasted for four months, a quarter of the animals' lifetimes. Dr. Chan and Dr. Longaker envision a time when doctors will be able to ""resurface"" arthritic joints or, even better, to treat people who are just beginning to develop arthritis, perhaps staving off the sort of damage that even joint replacements cannot fix. If the strategy works in humans, then early treatment may be the best approach, Dr. Marx said. ""Arthritis deforms joints and changes bones,"" he said. By the time people have hips or knees replaced, irreversible damage may be done. Legs may be bowed, bones damaged. ""You cannot totally turn back the clock,"" Dr. Marx said. At that point, he said, ""adding cartilage will not fix it."" He worries, though, that orthopedists may not wait for rigorous studies -- the method of awakening the dormant cells is relatively simple, and the drugs required are already on the market. Faced with a patient with aching knees, orthopedists may be tempted to say, ""Let's try this. You don't have much to lose,"" Dr. Marx noted.","Researchers discovered a way to awaken dormant stem cells and transform them into cartilage. If the technique works in humans, it may help ease debilitating joint pain.",be31e3aa-d2c1-5a6c-abfa-7f587922422f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/25/science/00SCI-ARTHRITIS/00SCI-ARTHRITIS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f7b06198c0c0f72ecc62a5f123813bd279a4e28d217257804f496446e0863267&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An X-ray of a healthy mouse.

Travel,Bushwhacking Up Maine's Baker Mountain,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/17/travel/maine-mt-baker-hiking.html,"Baker Mountain in Maine doesn't crack the top 100 list of New England peaks. But it certainly has stage presence. A full third taller than the two mountains on either side of it, and twice as wide, Baker looms large on its home turf. Last summer, as I sipped a mug of morning coffee at the edge of a wooden dock on Little Lyford Pond in the heart of the Maine North Woods, I admired this mountain's girth. It ate up the view across the glassy pond, a dark evergreen-covered mass that disappeared into a low ceiling of rain clouds. Wisps of those clouds swirled and rolled around the mountain's edges, as if a Greek god were up there stirring the soup. This mountain had mystique. Admittedly I was a bit giddy because my plan that day was to summit the mountain. But I am not alone in my first impressions. ""People get superexcited once they see it from the pond. And they immediately want to go to the top,"" said my guide, Casey Mealey, back at the dining hall for the Appalachian Mountain Club's Little Lyford Lodge. ""The adventurous ones, they want to go all the more once they find out there's no trails up it."" Last year, the Appalachian Mountain Club purchased Baker Mountain and its surrounding 4,300 acres of former timberlands, filling in a doughnut hole of private ownership in the conservation group's more than 70,000-acre Maine Woods Initiative to preserve the 100-Mile Wilderness region (so called because it encompasses what's considered the 100 wildest miles of the Appalachian Trail).

Amenities like marked hiking trails are in the works but a couple of years off. So for now, Baker is only for experts at backcountry trekking. It's a 10-mile hike from the Little Lyford Lodge just to get to the base, then a bushwhacking climb to the top, all with only a GPS unit and/or map and compass for guidance. I had a day set aside in a family vacation to do this, so I had hired Mr. Mealey to show me the way. As I finished a breakfast of baked eggs and cheese at the Little Lyford dining hall, Mr. Mealey slapped a handful of bacon slices between two pieces of toast and announced he was ready to go. Outside we were met by Steve Tatko, the mountain club's land manager, who was joining us. Turns out Mr. Mealey had never been up on Baker, so he asked Mr. Tatko, who had spent time on the mountain when surveying it for the purchase, to come along. In effect, my guide needed a guide.

Mr. Tatko was a slight fellow with circle wire-rim glasses, quite the contrast to Mr. Mealey with his dark beard and shoulder-length hair. But as I jumped into a pickup truck with them, it was clear the two native Mainers shared a deep love of these woods. ""You're going to have a great time today,"" Mr. Tatko told me during the bumpy ride along a logging road. ""We had some world-class adventure racers go up there, and they told us it was some of the toughest conditions they'd ever encountered."" Mr. Tatko had plotted a shortcut, driving to within a mile of the top then hiking a 1,000-foot ascent up Baker's spine of three lesser ridges. We pulled into a cutover clearing on the side of the mountain (the Appalachian Mountain Club has a sustainable logging plan to guide the forest back toward its native state), and loaded up our daypacks. White-throated sparrows were flitting about the curtain of spruce and fir trees at the edge of the cut, whistling their song of boreal wilderness -- ""Oh sweet Can-a-da, Can-a-da!"" I was giddy again as I looked up at the big hump of Baker, now just visible among the clouds.

""I bet there are probably two or three parties that do this every year, tops,"" Mr. Mealey said as we set off. We weren't far into stomping through the bush when we got our feet wet stepping across rivulets of icy clear water. ""People don't think of a mountain as being crucial to trout, but this one is,"" Mr. Tatko told me. The water flowing off Baker forms the headwaters for the West Branch of the Pleasant River, an important spawning area for wild Maine brook trout. Suddenly, more water entered the scene, this time from above. The sullen gray clouds had opened up, and the two guides and I hurriedly donned and cinched up our rain gear. We slogged on, pushing through tree branches. Mr. Mealey spiced up the bushwhacking by pointing out moose droppings and bear scat. Mr. Tatko, who stopped every few minutes to consult his GPS unit, pointed out a small heart-shaped tree leaf and announced that we had entered the Heartleaved Birch Subalpine Forest zone, a rare type of forest found only above 2,700-foot elevations in Maine. A girdled scar in the bark around a birch trunk, he said, was made by a chain from the last logging harvest in these woods in 1949. Then things got really thick. Our pace slowed to a crawl as we gingerly high-stepped among trees downed by wind and strewn about like scattered matchsticks. Each wet, slippery log offered another chance for a wrenched ankle. The bushwhacking got bushier, and Mr. Mealey showed me a freestyle swimming-like technique that involved putting my head down and digging with my hands into the spruce branches to pull myself through. Somehow this day hike had become full-body exercise.

We stopped for a snack of trail mix and apples, and I checked on a bloody spot where a jagged branch had punctured my sock. Mr. Mealey offered me a few wood sorrels, tiny clover-looking plants of the forest floor that deliver a bright citrus flash on the tongue, then we punched back into the thicket, this time stepping softly on a lush bed of pillowy moss that glowed bright green. ""The loggers never made it up here,"" Mr. Tatko said. ""This is virgin forest."" Twenty minutes later we arrived at another patch of fallen trees, where Mr. Tatko announced -- with a stream of rainwater pouring off the peak of his jacket hood -- that on a clear day we'd have a spectacular view of Mount Katahdin. He brightened up when we found a moose-stomped trail that looked as if it led to the top. Indeed we soon arrived in a grove of stunted spruce trees no taller than the tops of our heads, and there was no more uphill to be had. The GPS read 3,521 feet. ""We're here!"" Mr. Mealey cheered.

Mr. Tatko explained that this spot offered a stunning panorama of Moosehead Lake, but again the view was hidden behind a bank of leaden clouds. As a consolation prize, I looked down on the lesser summits along the ridgeline at wisps of breakaway clouds swirling and eddying against protruding rock walls. Again I enjoyed the ethereal cloud play along the flanks of Baker Mountain, this time from above. There was no center stage for this summit, no signpost to pose beside for pictures. So the guides and I snapped a couple of selfies huddled among the dwarf spruces, exposing our iPhones to the downpour for a few moments. The day was becoming a washout. Mr. Mealey was a bit disappointed as he had hoped to find a makeshift trail register in an old coffee can that he had heard rumors about. But there was no evidence anybody had ever been here. Summit achieved, we'd started down, when something orange flashed through the brush. Pushing through the branches, we found a twin cluster of spruce trees festooned with orange, blue and yellow surveyor's flagging, the brightly colored plastic strips whipping in the breeze like Tibetan prayer flags. Expert hikers often use these strips in the backcountry to find their way back out, but here they had made a makeshift shrine. Cradled in the nook of the double spruce was a white plastic PVC container. ""The coffee can!"" Mr. Mealey exclaimed. Sure enough, it held a notebook and a pen. ""Gatorade bottle leaked so we had a start a new book"" read one entry. Another spoke in a true Mainer's verse: ""Coulda been worse."" The dates listed in the entries were for about two to three parties a year. Mr. Tatko's guess was spot on.

The man, 63-year-old Andy Martin of Tucson, was a peakbagger -- a member of a cult of enthusiasts who collect prominent peaks the way birders build a life list. He had read about Baker Mountain on peakbagger.com, a storehouse for people looking to summit prominent mountains. Another peakbagging website defines ""prominent peaks"" as ""the highest free-standing mountains that have a noticeable separation between them and nearby higher peaks."" Looking through the notebook, Mr. Martin recognized a friend and fellow peakbagger who beat him here by a few years. Then he took a plastic baggie of gray dust from his backpack and sprinkled a pinch on a spruce. ""This is Jack Longacre, founder of the Highpointers Club,"" Mr. Martin said. Mr. Longacre had asked his friends to spread his ashes on mountain summits. Now he resides atop the high point in every state and several other peaks across the continent. We chatted a bit longer. Mr. Martin explained that his GPS unit had a low battery so he shut if off and tried walking in a straight line, only to get the unnerving feeling that was walking in circles. ""I am actually not a bad navigator out West, when the sun is shining and I'm not wrestling Christmas trees,"" Mr. Martin said. I lent him an extra compass from my daypack so he could get back down to his truck on the opposite side of the mountain. We shook hands and parted. My guides were still shaking their heads in gobsmacking disbelief as we restarted our descent.","It's not New England's most impressive peak, but it is an extreme hiker's delight and a challenge even for those with GPS.

Science,Saiga Population Grows After Mysterious Epidemic,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/21/science/saigas-kazakhstan.html,"It was a silent spring for saiga antelopes last year.

Within a few weeks in May in Kazakhstan, a mysterious illness claimed the lives of more than 200,000 of the endangered animals, or over 60 percent of the species.

This spring scientists and conservationists around the world waited anxiously to see whether the die-off would be repeated. Not only has May come and gone with no epidemic, but newly published results from an April census revealed that the saigas are making modest gains in population.

In particular, the Betpak-Dala saiga population in central Kazakhstan, which was hit hardest by the epidemic, grew from 31,000 after the die-off to 36,000 by April, said Steffen Zuther, who coordinates the Altyn Dala Conservation Initiative, a large-scale conservation program in central Kazakhstan.

""It's fantastic news,"" said Stephanie Ward, a representative of Britain's Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, a partner in the conservation program. She attributed the population growth to the Kazakh government's effort to combat poaching for meat and male saiga horns, which are prized in Chinese traditional medicine.",A recent census suggests the endangered antelopes in Kazakhstan are making modest gains after illness wiped out most of the species.,212df6d0-c433-5b9e-8efa-025cbc905e04,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/21/science/21tb-saigas/21tb-saigas-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7248c1a1ca3b93f28739d6096e44efdebfb6d62d3553ed79a2396a3bf5d3e46c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A saiga mother and calf.,212df6d0-c433-5b9e-8efa-025cbc905e04,N24News/imgs/212df6d0-c433-5b9e-8efa-025cbc905e04.jpg,2
Media,"After Biden Win, Right-Wing Sites Still Push False Vote-Fraud Claims",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/11/business/media/right-wing-sites-false-vote-fraud-claims.html,"The Associated Press and thousands of other news organizations reported on Saturday that Joseph R. Biden Jr. had won the 2020 presidential election. Since then a number of right-wing websites have refused to accept Mr. Biden's victory, backing baseless accusations by President Trump and his allies of a stolen election, despite statements to the contrary from international observers and state officials across the country. ""Overall right now President Trump is leading in the Presidential race,"" The Gateway Pundit said in an article on Monday. ""This race is not close to being over and the media's coordinated effort to steal this election and their collusion in calling the election for Joe Biden is a lie."" (Mr. Biden won the popular vote and crossed the threshold of 270 electoral votes.) The Gateway Pundit article went on to describe ""massive Democrat fraud in Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia and Pennsylvania,"" including claims that Republicans were barred from counting rooms. (Election officials in Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania have described those claims as false, and The New York Times found no evidence to support them.) John Nolte, a Breitbart News editor at large, opened his column on Monday by claiming, ""Joe Biden is not 'president-elect.'"" He went on to accuse the news media of dismissing ""the possibility of widespread voter fraud before anyone has had adequate time to make their case and produce evidence"" and of calling the election for Mr. Biden ""before the legal recounts and re-canvassings have taken place."" Mr. Nolte did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The right-wing pundit Dan Bongino, who has a wide readership on social media, used his platform to claim that the election was not over: ""There's nothing to concede,"" he said in Tuesday's episode of his podcast. ""I can't say this enough. This race has not been called yet."" (While the formal certification of votes could be delayed as Mr. Trump contests the results, White House advisers have warned the president that his chances of legal success were narrow, and foreign leaders have largely accepted Mr. Biden's victory.) Mr. Bongino declined to comment further. The Epoch Times, an international newspaper affiliated with the Falun Gong religious movement, expressed doubt in a headline and article on Sunday: ""Election Outcome Unclear Amid Pending Recounts and Legal Challenges."" The effect of such statements is to corrode trust in the truth, especially among people ""who were already convinced that the election was going to be rigged,"" said Whitney Phillips, who lectures on media literacy and misinformation at Syracuse University. Casting doubt on the integrity of the vote, she added, ""has been a fundamental part of Trump's election strategy,"" which she called ""a cynical, grotesque attempt to undermine and, frankly, set a torch to democracy."" ""What's absolutely critical is for people to understand how long of a con this actually has been, that it is not the case that these narratives have only emerged in the wake of Biden's victory,"" Ms. Phillips said. ""Donald Trump himself and all of his surrogates and the media that supports him have been seeding this narrative for months and months and months, talking about voting irregularities long before any votes were cast."" Misinformation about the outcome has run rampant online in recent days. A vote tally typo in Michigan set off voter fraud allegations on social media, fanned in part by Mr. Trump. False claims that Mr. Biden had lost Pennsylvania circulated after top Republicans said that the political news site Real Clear Politics had ""rescinded"" its call on the state. (The site had not yet projected a winner in Pennsylvania.)",Many publications have refused to acknowledge the president-elect.,7eac8589-afd9-568b-b66e-20caec399a5d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/10/business/10vote-fraud-media-01/merlin_179670546_4f48f4a6-64b8-4d58-9802-619cb8c14709-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=f77bd5c98fdeb6cdc134f87800795132e40acdfff2304104a1ed9ceddc2eb96b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Casting doubt on the integrity of the vote ""has been a fundamental part of Trump's election strategy,"" said Whitney Phillips of Syracuse University.",7eac8589-afd9-568b-b66e-20caec399a5d,N24News/imgs/7eac8589-afd9-568b-b66e-20caec399a5d.jpg,16
