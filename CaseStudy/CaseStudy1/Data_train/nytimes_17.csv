Science,How Geckos Move Across Water,https://www.nytimes.com/video/science/100000006247678/how-geckos-move-across-water.html,"How nice it must be to skate on a pond when it's not even frozen. Lots of insects can do it, like these water striders. Since they're so small, surface tension holds them up. Bigger creatures, like these grebes, rely on muscle power. They slap the water with their feet and follow through with a paddle-like push. The famous basilisk lizards do the same thing. And now, we can add the Asian house gecko to this elite group. Field researchers in Singapore discovered that geckos, too, can run across water when they're scared, as you can see in this rare footage. Amazingly, they go just as fast on the water as they do on land. Researchers tested the mechanics of this motion in a lab at the University of California, Berkeley. What they found is that geckos slapped the water with all four feet, trapping pockets of air. That helps with the follow-through stroke as they push forward. Their tail also undulates like a snake or an alligator swimming. You only see that from above. These two engines -- feet and tail -- raise the gecko's body high enough above the surface so that it hydroplanes. The gecko's movement also depends on surface tension. Look what happened when the researchers added soap to the water to reduce that tension. The geckos floundered, struggling to stay above the surface. They could still move along, but only at about half-speed. It was too much for some of them. They just went on strike and stopped altogether -- proving that geckos are not only fast, but smart.","The Asian house gecko can move across water at great speed by using a half-running, half-swimming motion.",66e69d-1783-517d-8668-6181bc8de6b2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/12/autossell/Gecko/Gecko-facebookJumbo.jpg?video-overlay?video-overlay,"Pauline Jennings, UC Berkeley.

Art & Design,Can Jeff Koons Teach Me to Paint?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/27/arts/design/can-jeff-koons-teach-me-to-paint.html,"Jeff Koons with his ""Gazing Ball (Birdbath)."" He is sharing his secrets with student-artists as an instructor for MasterClass.





The history of vanguard artists teaching -- as a job, as art, or as some combination of the two -- is rich and varied. Joseph Beuys conceived of lectures as performances, explaining artworks to a dead hare in a famous 1965 piece. Faith Ringgold has worked with students from pre-K through college and composed remarkable children's books. Ian Wilson, who died in April, spent years leading discussions of his ideas in a Socratic style. Now Jeff Koons has entered the classroom at age 65, signing on as an instructor for MasterClass, the video platform through which celebrities like RuPaul, Natalie Portman, and Usher have shared their expertise. The school's tuition for unlimited access is $180, billed yearly. I signed up immediately (I'm a fan), curious to see how Mr. Koons might adapt his grand vision for artists with more modest ambitions. I had struggled through one drawing class in college to become an art history major, but never developed any original ideas, much less the skills to realize them, and put aside artmaking as soon as I could. But from the first moments of his two-hour program on ""art and creativity,"" it is apparent that this will not be Bob Ross's ""The Joy of Painting."" ""What is art?"" Mr. Koons asks. ""Is it painting? Is it sculpture?"" Sure, you might respond, but he is still talking. ""Art is a vehicle that lets us have an impact on the external world, and also lets the external world have an impact on us.""

Mr. Koons, of course, has made an impact. His steel ""Rabbit"" (1986) sculpture sold at auction last year for $91.1 million, the highest price ever paid on the block for the work of a living artist. Over a four-decade career, his unforgettable, scrupulously crafted renditions and appropriations of mass-culture subjects (balloon animals, vacuum cleaners, the Hulk) have graced prestigious museum halls, the Palace of Versailles, and the estates of our wealthiest. He is one of the few artists who is a household name. He is also intensely divisive, for his unabashed celebration of decadence and his outsourced production methods. Love him or hate him, he has entered the pantheon. Those tuning in to glean some of the master's magic may be disappointed, however. While the chef Thomas Keller demonstrates how to cook scrambled eggs on MasterClass and the tennis star Serena Williams walks viewers through groundstrokes, Mr. Koons is here as a life coach and a salesman. He wants us to succeed, and he wants us to be happy. ""Please have a voice with your work, because everybody is depending on you,"" he says. ""You need to be courageous. And in being courageous, you're just being courageous with yourself.""

Successfully making art requires accepting yourself, in Mr. Koons's philosophy, so that you can pursue your interests without shame. ""Everything about your past is perfect,"" he says. ""Everything up to this moment about you is spectacular."" (RuPaul actually offers pretty much the same advice -- ""Know that you are perfect as you are!"" -- in an energetic segment on ""owning the room"" in his own class.) For veteran Koons watchers, these affirmational bromides will be very familiar, but his unrelenting earnestness is both impressive and unsettling. Clad in dark blue -- blazer, shirt and pants -- he sits in cavernous, deserted studio spaces in much of the footage, speaking with controlled cheer. His delivery is as smooth as soft butter spread across warm bread. I found myself mindlessly nodding along, as he compares an ashtray that he remembers loving as a child, with a reclining woman holding her legs aloft, to Michelangelo's ""Pieta."" ""How can that be any less than this masterpiece by Michelangelo?"" he says. ""It's equal."" Wait, what?

The 13 short episodes are ostensibly devoted to different aspects of making and understanding art. In ""Approaching the Blank Canvas,"" Mr. Koons explains, ""I like to start with an idea."" He asks himself, ""What have I been pulled to? What have the interests been lately?"" He believes this will work for you, too. In ""The Power of Color,"" we learn that ""color is one of the main tools an artist can use to communicate."" He's ""always been pulled to turquoise."" I'm a sucker for purples and pinks myself. Really, this is a sumptuously produced infomercial for Mr. Koons's art, and the best moments -- the funniest, the weirdest -- are when he feels free to cast off his teaching responsibilities and just talk giddily about his art, not yours, and his zest for Titian and Rubens, Bernini and Queirolo. (Women do not figure in this curriculum.) Holding a pink inflatable bunny, our teacher recalls realizing in the late-1970s that he could present it as ready-made sculpture. ""This is like lungs,"" he says. ""It's like us. It's like you. Take a deep breath."" He inhales. Reliving the rush of that eureka moment, Mr. Koons says that the pink in the toy ""was transforming me; I was becoming vaster,"" and ""I foresaw that, yes, I can expand even further.""

He loves the idea of ""laying in the yard and just looking up, thinking about the vastness of life, the power of nature, and the beauty of a flower,"" but acknowledges that nature is ""ruthless and just will take any course to be able to fulfill its desire."" And that 1988 porcelain sculpture of a topless blonde holding Pink Panther? Mr. Koons asks, ""What would she be doing with this Pink Panther other than maybe masturbating with it?"" All in all, though, this is a fairly chaste version of Mr. Koons. This is an artist who depicted himself in erotic poses with the porn star Ilona Staller, his first wife, in his ""Made in Heaven"" paintings. Those works go unmentioned in the MasterClass videos. (The series is gingerly described in an accompanying PDF -- a kind of Koons study guide -- of 35 pages.) This Mr. Koons is speaking to fellow executives -- the managers of people and capital who are his potential collectors. While his army of assistants (downsized last year) deals with ""the same details over and over again"" in his art, he says, ""I'm able to leave the room and come back with a fresh eye and be able to see something a little more clearly."" Chief executives and management consultants, and those who read their memoirs and self-help books, would no doubt approve. Mr. Koons emphasizes that he strove to remain ""self-reliant,"" working day jobs (selling Museum of Modern Art memberships and commodities), and that it's important to be able to deal with criticism. This is solid advice for aspiring artists -- some of the only instances of it in the show. The only real assignment he gives is to ""maybe create a notebook"" of images to inspire you. I will admit that I have not yet done this, but I am embracing his guidance about self-acceptance. Like any good advertisement, the most sizzling sequences venerate his latest products. We get a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of ""Pink Ballerina,"" an intricate stone rendering of a dancer lifting her lace tutu. Mr. Koons says he has been working on it for eight years, and selected pink rock to convey ""information of femininity and hopefully of fertility and a sense of future."" I'm continually awed by his ability to free-associate, but worry students would be laughed at by art-school peers if they offered his brand of analysis. Much of what our host says about art does not make logical sense, but on certain points he is conspicuously direct. He wants us to know that, when it comes to dedicated artists, ""oftentimes, the late work is really the best."" And he is assiduous about details; when one fabrication job fell short of his expectations, he remembers worrying that people are ""going to feel that I didn't care about them.""","Jeff Koons has entered the classroom at 65, signing on as an instructor for MasterClass.

Travel,Readers' Stories of Love on the Road,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/19/travel/love-travel-reader-stories.html,"We ended up spending the next nearly three weeks together. I met several of his friends and went to his birthday party. We even did a little weekend getaway staycation in central Saigon. The instant connection became even deeper. But I had to leave: It was time to return to the United States, get a new job and work on paying off those loans from law school. There were a lot of tears the night we said goodbye. I honestly thought I would never see him again. Once back in New York, I simply couldn't get this guy out of my head. I thought about him every day, so I sent him a message. The next day, I awoke to his reply. We started messaging every few days, which became every day and then several times a day before text messages graduated to phone calls and Skype. While Skyping on New Year's Eve 2015, I told him I was in love. He said he was too. I struggled with what to do for the next several months before I decided to quit my new job after only six months to move back to Asia and be with him. When we met at the airport, after nearly a year apart, it felt like something from a movie -- only without the romantic airport kiss, because of the taboo there of being gay. Three months ago, after 10 months in Asia, I learned he'd been keeping a huge secret from me. I was devastated and in shock. A few weeks later, I packed my bags and came back to New York. I've been back two months. While it has been good seeing friends, I can't get him out of my head. With no job, it also gives me plenty of time to think about him and our time together. I miss him. I still love him. I'm just not sure what to do now, but the more I think about him, the more I want to get on a plane and go back. THREE YEARS AGO, I traveled to Mongolia with my father. I was 40; he was 71. After two weeks of touring natural and historic sites, we set off on a fly-fishing expedition to the Onon River. Making a hunting or fishing trip part of the itinerary was how we would ""get outside of the tourist bubble,"" my father had said. It's how we'd get a true sense of the people, the place. Ten hours after we left Ulaanbaatar, along with Hongoroo, the driver, and Zorig, our guide and translator, we crested a mountain to look down on the village of Binder and the Onon River valley.

We spent four days fishing, eating, talking, hiking and exploring. We drank vodka and ate marmot. We listened to wolves howl in the midnight hour from a field of wildflowers, atop a mountain, under a star-splattered sky. And amid it all, a spark ignited between Zorig and me. On our final night in the ger (yurt) camp, I watched my father put himself to bed and then stepped outside to watch the half-moon rise over the horizon -- and to discover what there was between this Mongol man and myself. He appeared at my side within minutes. He soon invited me into their ger to talk and drink vodka. After a spell, the driver and other men departed. Alone, Zorig and I kissed. Hugged and kissed. Then I bid good night and returned to my ger. The next morning, we drove back to Ulaanbaatar. That evening, our last in Mongolia, Zorig took us out to a fine restaurant for our last supper. While I tried to communicate my appreciation for a fun and exciting interlude, he invited me out. I felt that if I didn't go, I'd forever suffer from a terrible case of ""what if."" And so I went with him to a live music club a few blocks away. We drank. We talked. We slow-danced, kissing underneath the lights in the middle of the dance floor. A Western woman with a Mongolian man is rare. All eyes were on us. I'm not sure if it was the vodka, the lights and smoke, the foreign music, the smell of his after-shave, or his imperfect yet adorable English, but I was mesmerized. In the morning, he delivered us to the airport. Refusing our tips, he shook my father's hand and hugged him. As Zorig hugged me, he whispered, ""I love you,"" into my ear. I thought he was crazy, or perhaps some sort of Casanova. But I did not sleep on the flight to Beijing. Or the flight to San Francisco. Or the flight to Denver. His words, his smell, that kiss, his incredible audacity -- he was all I could think about. Months later, he visited the United States. He proposed. That next summer, I sold everything and moved to Mongolia, and we married three months later. ""MAY I SIT HERE?"" I had failed to get a reserved seat for the overnight journey from Kolkata to my hometown, Katihar. And so I asked the only person with an empty seat in the packed train coach. ""Of course, you can,"" she said, moving her satchel to make room. ""Thanks, just let me know when you wish to doze off,"" I said. ""I'll move to another seat."" ""No, I'll get off the train at 2 a.m.,"" she said. ""I fear remaining asleep through my stop, and hence will remain awake.""

""So, you don't trust your phone's alarm to defeat your slumber? I never do either!"" The giggle that followed led to the beginning of our first informal conversation. She turned out to be an arts and dance student from Kolkata who was traveling to attend a friend's wedding. We talked about our common interests: ""A Tale of Two Cities."" The composer A. R. Rahman. Street food at Barabazaar. A walk across the Howrah Bridge. It was already past midnight. The train was now crossing the river Ganga on Farakka Barrage, the longest dam in India. The roar of waters gushing through the gates underneath the rail track was palpable. The river seemed to be spread out to infinity. ""I never knew Ganga was this majestic! I have never been to this part of India before."" Her startled eyes gleamed even in the darkness of the coach. ""Is it a full-moon night?"" Indeed it was. The giant orb of the moon had emerged from concealing clouds into a clean, rain-bathed sky. The river glowed under its sheen, studded with a million tiny moons scattered throughout its surface, confined only by the horizon. Her gaze remained stuck to the moon, as mine remained to her. She lay down on the seat, and I deposited myself, cross-legged, into a corner. The train drifted southward, and now the moonlight, filtered through the window glass fell incessantly on her face. She silently crept her head into my lap. She knew I was looking at her, and smiled, her eyes still closed. I prayed for the train to be delayed, perhaps infinitely. That was not to be. The train chugged into her destination station precisely on time. I accompanied her with the luggage to the gate. I thought of requesting her phone number, but at that very moment, she got a call from the friend who was at the station to take her home. She disembarked as soon as the train stopped. Her friend, waiting half-sleepily, hugged her, grabbed her luggage and walked off.

I REACHED UP to put my coat in the overhead compartment. Thanks to the generosity of my in-laws, I would be staying in one of the best hotels in Paris, on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore. They had insisted that I join them on this trip even though my husband had opted out, at the last minute, to take a small part in a regional theater production. So, my first trip to Europe would be in the role of daughter-in-law and not that of amorous young wife. I was excited and disappointed simultaneously. This was not the first time that my husband had chosen his career over us -- something that had become a source of conflict. I was feeling less like a partner and more like a possession. His wealthy family sent him money every month while I struggled to pay my half of our expenses. I had become resentful, and this cancellation, of what I had hoped would be a chance to revive our increasingly distant relationship, was something of a last straw. The plane was nearly empty. I was alone in coach class except for a girl who looked like a model. As I stretched to put my new, light blue raincoat away, I turned my head. Leaning against the seats a few rows away was a guy, smiling mischievously and observing me appreciatively. ""Je peux vous aider?"" -- Can I help you? -- he asked. And with that glance, the course of my life changed. WE WERE BARRELING along in our chartered, 36-foot sailboat on a passage from Carriacou to Mayreau, two islands in the St. Vincent and the Grenadines chain. I was at the helm, Michael checking the charts, as we approached the Grand de Coi Reef -- nasty and sprawling. The sailing conditions were rugged that day with the seas cresting to 10 feet, the winds blowing 20 to 25 knots. While I was concentrating on the course and the depth meter, an even stronger gust snatched my hat and spun it out of reach over the churning waves before dropping it into the sea far from the boat. With the jagged reef so close at hand, there was nothing to do but carry on as my beloved hat and I parted company.

The hat was nothing special, a little white baseball cap I used to keep the sun off my face. But it was a sentimental favorite, a souvenir from a 60th birthday trip two years before that Michael, my head-in-the-clouds professor of a husband, had planned for me with astonishingly uncharacteristic attention to detail. I cherished the hat both for the lovely occasion and his efforts to make it so. ""Don't worry about the hat,"" Michael said. ""We'll go back for it as soon as we've cleared the reef and are in a good spot to drop the sails."" It was a harebrained idea, though I appreciated his offer. We were streaking north at almost 8 knots while the hat was disappearing to the west, carried not just by strong winds but by a heavy current as well. How could we possibly calculate a course that would pinpoint its location long after we had sailed away from it? Not to mention picking out a tiny white hat embedded in a mass of foaming white breakers. But even as I continued steering our course past the reef, I saw Michael poring over the instruments and the chart. ""What are you doing?"" I asked. ""Calculating our course back to your hat."" Twenty minutes later, I was still laughing at the lunacy of our fool's errand. Yet: We miraculously spied the errant hat, slipping and sliding in the waves. Putting our long-practiced ""man-over-board"" drill to excellent use, we rescued it with the boat hook. We were in high spirits at sunset that evening, celebrating our triumph with a good bottle of wine and a lobster in the boat's cockpit. Unspoken but underlying our celebration was the relief that, just eight weeks before, Michael had finished a course of radiation. We had three more years of fine and funny sails in our much-loved Grenadines before Michael's cancer came back to claim him. I was in the early throes of empty nest syndrome, when my manager asked me to go to Bratislava, Slovakia, for work. ""Plan on three months,"" he said, ""maybe six."" My husband and I had never been there. Why not?, we thought. ""Yes,"" I replied.

After three decades of busy-ness -- three kids, work, volunteer positions -- we soon arrived at our post-Soviet fixer-upper 45 miles east of Vienna: a mile-long concrete housing complex, graffiti, freshly painted pastel palaces, hipster coffee shops, limited English. At first, it felt like a grand European vacation. We ate out every night, mastering the language of wurst and schnitzel. With few expats in town, our budding network of friends contained a disproportionate number of wait staff. They smiled when we entered, engaged in a noun-rich conversation before saying, ""The usual?"" Nothing felt more citizen-of-the-world than having a ""usual"" in a city most of my friends had never heard of. Two-hour dinners became the norm. No more car-pools or last minute business trips -- just my husband of 35 years and the leisurely pace of European service. One evening over dinner, I said, ""Tell me a story."" He sat back for a moment, then began to chuckle. I can't remember the last time I had seen him so animated as he recounted a high school road trip gone awry with his screwball friends. I had never heard this story, and I wondered how that was possible. A series of first dates commenced. We huddled over pork knuckle or goose with red cabbage for hours, venting about the most recent foible (taking the right bus in the wrong direction, learning at 8 a.m. that ""toast"" was a grilled cheese sandwich, spending 30 minutes filling out a tram-pass form with my English-Slovak dictionary). My husband visited our 30-year-old Serbian-born pizza waiter in his dreary, communist-style apartment, indulging in the traditional shots of welcome brandy at 9:30 in the morning. I laughed as he recounted how he looked on in disbelief when his friend poured a second shot. Our relationship deepened. For the first time in three decades, with no other distractions or commitments, we had the time and space to decompress. To remember why we fell in love in the first place. To realize our love was still strong. We ended up staying in Bratislava for two years, selling everything back home except for a storage unit of things adequate to furnish a small condo upon our return. That never happened. Instead, we moved to Budapest for two more years. I retired. We emptied the storage unit, and became nomads: Paris. Berlin. Traverse City, Michigan. Guatemala. Philadelphia. Cuba. It's been six years since I said ""yes."" I grew to love Bratislava. It's the place that reintroduced me to my husband and changed our lives.",We asked readers to submit their accounts of romances experienced while traveling.

Art & Design,500 Years of Pregnant Women in Art,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/13/arts/design/pregnant-women-art.html,"LONDON -- The actress Demi Moore stands sideways to the camera, one hand splayed around a breast, another cupping her 7-months-pregnant stomach. The 1991 Annie Leibowitz photograph on the cover of Vanity Fair was a culture-changing moment; an unashamed representation of the pregnant body that shocked the world. ""It was a watershed moment in the representation of pregnancy, the point at which visual images of pregnancy began to be more common,"" said Karen Hearn, the curator of ""Portraying Pregnancy,"" an exhibition running through April 26 at the Foundling Museum in London. ""But even 20 years ago, women were still wearing dresses like tents. The problem with pregnancy is that it defines a sexually active woman, and throughout history, that has always been a problem."" The show, which begins with 15th-century images of the Visitation -- part of the New Testament narrative around the Virgin Mary -- unfolds chronologically over 500 years of mostly British art and artifacts. It includes portraits, caricatures, garments and curiosities, like a tiny 17th-century anatomical model of a pregnant woman that comes apart to reveal the fetus and organs inside. ""I feel this offers us a fresh lens to look at women's lives in history,"" Ms. Hearn said. Ms. Hearn first became interested in representations of pregnancy while working as a curator of 16th and 17th-century British art at the Tate museums, she said. While negotiating the acquisition of a 1595 portrait of a visibly pregnant noblewoman, it occurred to her that there was almost no research on the representation of pregnancy in Western art. She began to investigate and lecture on the topic. When she began, around 20 years ago, people often got uncomfortable, she said. ""They thought it was indelicate.""

She discovered that while there were images of pregnant women during the 16th and 17th centuries, there were only rare examples to be found between then and the early 20th century. Ms. Hearn said that she focused on British art in the exhibition, but that consultation with specialists in other European countries showed that portrayals of pregnancy over the past several centuries had been relatively rare in most of the West. During a tour of the exhibition, and in a recent interview, Ms. Hearn discussed some of her favorite images from ""Portraying Pregnancy.""

In 1526, the German painter Hans Holbein II came to England for the first time, carrying a letter of introduction from the Dutch philosopher Erasmus to his great friend Sir Thomas More, who would soon be King Henry VIII's lord chancellor. More commissioned a family portrait from the painter, for which Holbein made a number of preparatory sketches, including this drawing, in black and colored chalk, of More's youngest daughter, Cecily. ""She is wearing the customary bodice of an elite woman of the period, but the front-lacing of her gown has been loosened, and her hands seem to be resting on her stomach, a detail that is more explicit in the full-length depiction of her in the family group,"" Ms. Hearn said, adding that women of this period probably simply adapted their clothes to accommodate their pregnancies, rather than having specific garments made. ""What is remarkable that even in this sketch, Holbein captures the vitality and alert intelligence of her expression,"" Ms. Hearn added. ""She seems comfortable and at ease in her condition.""

The Flemish-born painter Marcus Gheeraerts II was brought to England by his father as a boy, and became a prolific and important court painter from around 1590. ""By the time he did this portrait, in 1620, he had been painting visibly pregnant women for 25 years, and his style evolved over the years to become more and more naturalistic,"" Ms. Hearns said. ""We don't know who she is, but the silver embroidery on her skirt, the lace and long pearls suggest she is from a wealthy, elite family. The way her hand lies over the bump is beautifully observed and expressive, and her pregnancy is very obvious,"" Ms. Hearn said. This would soon go out of fashion in court circles, she added; by 1625, new dress trends brought by Charles I's French queen made pregnancy less obvious, and images more ambiguous.

Stays were corset-like garments worn in the 17th century to shape a woman's figure, and this set, purpose-made for pregnancy and dating from around 1665-75, is paired with a matching ""stomacher,"" made from matching fabric, which fitted underneath. They are thought to have been produced for Mary Verney, a noblewoman, and are finely made from linen, silk, leather, ribbon and strips of baleen, which came from a whale's mouth. ""The stomacher lay underneath the stays, which could be loosened as the pregnancy progressed, and the strips at the bottom splay out as you get bigger,"" Ms. Hearn said. ""It's astonishing how well these have kept their pattern and color. The quality of these garments reflects the status and life of their owner; it's almost like a portrait, because they were made specifically for an individual.""

It wasn't uncommon for 18th-century actresses to carry on working while pregnant, Ms. Hearn said, but Sarah Siddons, one of the leading performers of her day, was particularly stoical, treading the boards for almost the full terms of her eight pregnancies between 1774 and 1794. ""The theater managers obviously wanted her to perform for as long as possible, and she seems to have been happy to do it,"" Ms. Hearn said, adding that audiences were very aware of her condition and that the press would frequently speculate about the sex of the expected child.

This 1814 portrait, by G. H. Harlow, was painted after her retirement in 1812, and shows Siddons as Lady Macbeth, her most famous role, which she played during several pregnancies. ""It's the sleepwalking scene and she is wearing a nightgown, which you wouldn't normally see, and washing her hands of the murder of King Duncan,"" Ms. Hearn said. ""She doesn't look too upset really, perhaps just decorously tormented."" After a long absence in portraiture during the 18th and 19th centuries, pictures of pregnant women began to reappear in the early 20th century, Ms. Hearn said. But even then, they were mostly the work of male artists painting their wives, and kept for private viewing, suggesting a taboo. ""This is quite an early work by Lucian Freud, painted in 1947 soon after his partner, Kitty Garman, had discovered she was pregnant,"" Ms. Hearn said. ""She is clutching a not-quite-open rose, which connects her back to Tudor and Van Dyke images of pregnancy,"" she added. ""Freud had a very clear idea of how he wanted her to pose, and it's a powerful and disturbing portrait. She looks rather terrified; the pregnancy is part of the narrative although it's not visible. It's still a time when pregnancy isn't in portraits for public consumption,"" Ms. Hearn said.

This 1984 painting by Ghislaine Howard, an artist based in Manchester, England, was ""a remarkable picture, and an expression of what it might feel like to be pregnant that is very different to the way male artists have depicted pregnancy,"" Ms. Hearn said. Ms. Howard felt there weren't enough prototypes for images of pregnant women, Ms. Hearn said. ""She created this image that has a real sense of weariness and bigness,"" she added. ""She isn't elegantly dressed, and we feel the way in which she is waiting. It reminds me of Durer's ""Melancholia"" from 1514, which also shows a female figure resting her head on one hand.

Art & Design,Santiago Calatrava to Design His First London Complex,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/arts/design/santiago-calatrava-london-peninsula-place.html,"LONDON -- The Spanish-born architect Santiago Calatrava is known among New Yorkers as the designer of the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, which cost almost twice its original $2.2 billion estimate, an overshoot that has been attributed partly to him. That hasn't prevented Mr. Calatrava from landing his first London project, right next to the O2 concert arena on the Greenwich Peninsula. The 1 billion British pound (about $1.25 billion), 1.4-million-square-foot complex -- named Peninsula Place -- will consist of three towers with curving sides, a domed Winter Garden public passageway, an arcade and a vast footbridge. The client is Knight Dragon, a development company owned by the billionaire Hong Kong entrepreneur Henry Cheng.

""New York and Lisbon and Bilbao: they were rehearsals for the important piece of work he's about to do for us,"" Mr. Khan said. The Greenwich complex will contain offices, apartments, a hotel, shops and restaurants, while the footbridge will mark the Greenwich meridian, the line on the world map that separates east from west. The complex is part of London's biggest single regeneration plan, an PS8.4 billion urban transformation scheme that will lead to the construction of 15,720 new homes, schools, public spaces, a film studio and a design district. Mr. Calatrava said in an interview that he spent a year and a half on the project, producing 10 different studies and models. He said he believed that the client had chosen him because he had done several other transportation hubs in cities including Lisbon; Lyon, France; and Zurich.

Peninsula Place will be partially built over a London Underground subway station, and be ""at the heart"" of a transportation hub, he said. Asked about the cost overruns in New York, Mr. Calatrava attributed them to ""extra work."" Subway lines had to be ""rebuilt completely all the way through the site,"" he said, and as much as $500 million in additional expenses became necessary after the 2004 and 2005 terrorist attacks on the transport networks in Madrid and London. Has his reputation suffered? ""My reputation brings me to do this magnificent project in London, and I am happy,"" Mr. Calatrava said. The vice chairman of Knight Dragon, Sammy Lee, said he was ""not worried at all about cost overruns."" Mr. Calatrava's only other project in England is a footbridge in Manchester.","The architect's 1.4-million-square-foot project, next to the O2 arena, will have three curved towers, a domed passageway, an arcade and a footbridge.",9e9b118b-48b8-5541-b918-371ad29a27b5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/02/arts/03calatrava-item2/03calatrava-item2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=549a89df263f408c739c620935efbfa65023acf2b650f3474d65d4e17fadbd96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A rendering of Santiago Calatrava's design for Peninsula Place.,9e9b118b-48b8-5541-b918-371ad29a27b5,N24News/imgs/9e9b118b-48b8-5541-b918-371ad29a27b5.jpg,14
Theater,Review: Camp and Compassion in 'The Confession of Lily Dare',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/theater/confession-of-lily-dare-review-charles-busch.html,"For all their freedoms and frank carnality, the movies of Hollywood's pre-Code era -- roughly 1929 to 1934 -- were often about sacrifice. A woman's sacrifice, to be sure: her honor in exchange for a man's, her happiness for her child's. As the Great Depression took grip, such stories taught America to reframe deprivation as duty, just as Hollywood, entering the sound age, was teaching itself how to speak. One result of the coincidence was the emergence of a new kind of actress, emoting vividly in a stagy accent acquired somewhere between Bryn Mawr and Broadway. Those clipped tones and eccentric pronunciations eventually became part of the drag vocabulary -- and they certainly are part of the joy of ""The Confession of Lily Dare,"" Charles Busch's delicious mash-up of pre-Code weepies that opened on Wednesday at the Cherry Lane Theater. Only when spoken in the manner of a woman fudging her origins could words like ""feminine"" (fem-i-neen) and ""avalanche"" (ah-vuh-lonzh) become such pungent punch lines. Yet Busch, himself a feminine avalanche -- and a reluctant ""drag legend"" -- doesn't really impersonate Ruth Chatterton, Miriam Hopkins, Helen Hayes and the other stars who played harlots, murderesses and mothers forced to give up their children in movies like ""Madame X"" (1929), ""Sarah and Son"" (1930), ""The Sin of Madelon Claudet"" (1931) and ""Frisco Jenny"" (1932). Nor when Busch adds bits of Mae West, Bette Davis, Marlene Dietrich and Joan Crawford into the mix does he bind himself to the style of any one of them.

Instead, playing Lily at various ages and in various predicaments, he offers something of a group portrait of these divas, always hovering at the midpoint between spoof and homage. Beyond the externals that echo each woman in particular roles -- the accents, the gestures, the hairstyles and gowns -- there is an insider's bemused love of them all.

So, too, with genre. ""The Confession of Lily Dare"" is not based on any one mother-love film but rather, it seems, on a hundred. The turn-of-the-20th-century plot naturally begins with an orphan, Lily, whose mother is killed in an ah-vuh-lonzh. After showing up at the San Francisco home of her only remaining relative -- Rosalie Mackintosh, a tough-as-nails madam (Jennifer Van Dyck) -- she befriends the help: Mickey, a gay piano player (Kendal Sparks); Emmy Lou, a plucky prostitute (Nancy Anderson); and Louis, an upstanding bookkeeper (Christopher Borg). Louis is not upstanding for long; after getting Lily pregnant, he promptly dies in the 1906 earthquake. To support her fatherless baby girl, Lily appeals to Blackie Lambert (Howard McGillin), who describes himself with a twinkle as ""a shady character from a once prominent family who adds a veneer of class to whatever room he's in."" He remakes Lily as Mandalay, a cabaret sensation whose big number is a spot-on Dietrich pastiche (by Tom Judson) called ""Pirate Joe."" But before long Mandalay winds up in jail, taking the rap for Blackie over the theft of some diamond earrings. I hardly need explain how the baby, Louise, is adopted by a pair of wealthy San Franciscans, and how Lily, now going by Treasure Jones, reinvents herself post-prison as a madam like her aunt, but kinder. (She scrapbooks.) Suffice it to say that when Louise (Van Dyck again) grows up to be an opera star, Lily refuses to ruin the girl's career by revealing her besmirched maternity, even unto death.

You could call this camp heaven, and indeed ""Lily Dare,"" a Primary Stages production, offers both the euphoria and the shabbiness that term can suggest. As in earlier works like ""Vampire Lesbians of Sodom,"" which ran for five years Off Broadway, Busch doesn't fuss over logic or continuity. Here, he simply lets Mickey and Emmy Lou, visiting Lily's grave decades later, escort the story from scene to scene with bald narration. The visual transitions are likewise written the way they would be in a movie, begging for quick dissolves that can't be achieved and leaving us to twiddle our thumbs while the stage crew resets the furniture. But these clunks are essential to the Busch style, and not just because his plays, with the exception of his Broadway hit ""The Tale of the Allergist's Wife,"" have usually been niche-taste, shoestring affairs. A slight lack of professional polish is part of their aesthetic, one Busch shares with longtime collaborators including the director Carl Andress, who blithely suggests the earthquake with little more than a few falling books; the set designer B.T. Whitehill, who has fashioned a proscenium out of pink plastic Frisbees; and Jessica Jahn, whose hilarious outfits for Lily have more than a hint of the thrift shop about them. (The apt costumes for everyone else are by Rebecca Townsend.) In the same way, the multiple roles that some cast members play (though Anderson and McGillin are perfect in just one role each) function as both thrift and humor. Borg, for instance, is not just Louis the accountant but a pervy German baron, an Italian vocal coach and an Irish priest with a taste for opera. Having to distinguish them from one another pushes each to riotous extremes. Where Busch never stints is in the diamond precision of the overripe patois, studded with boneyards, gin blossoms, the clap and the ""agony box."" (That's a piano.) As Treasure Jones, Lily refuses to let her doughboy clients get drunk: ""We owe it to their mothers to protect their livers."" And awaiting her final fate she imagines the shame she might have brought on her daughter had the truth been revealed. ""My mother a bordello madam. My mother a murderess. My mother ... a cabaret performer."" That's the Busch touch: mordant and winking (he has often been a cabaret performer himself) yet oddly, genuinely moving. If he is unafraid of the cliches of disowned genres, and inhabits so lovingly the women who uttered them, perhaps that's because they actually had more to say than the dismissive term ""weepies"" (or, for that matter, ""camp"") implies. Turns out that sacrifice is something we really did need to learn. Who's weeping now?",Charles Busch's mash-up of mother-love weepies finds both pathos and hilarity in the tough talk of Hollywood divas.,d73808e0-8d77-5633-a6b2-863e714fcc12,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/30/arts/29lilydare1/29lilydare1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0341046d6d4f5ba78c09ef918ef348586cf03ca5f99e91a161fee53ea1fd626f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Charles Busch, left, as the title character and Nancy Anderson as a plucky prostitute in &ldquo;The Confession of Lily Dare.&rdquo;",d73808e0-8d77-5633-a6b2-863e714fcc12,N24News/imgs/d73808e0-8d77-5633-a6b2-863e714fcc12.jpg,10
Dance,Dance Listings for Jan. 8-14,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/08/arts/dance/dance-listings-for-jan-8-14.html,"  American Dance Platform (Tuesday through Jan. 17) American companies hailing from sea to shining sea are presented here by the Joyce Theater and White Bird, an influential Portland, Ore., dance organization, as part of the tsunami of dance showcases hitting New York for the annual gathering of arts presenters. The four split-bill programs will pair established troupes, like the Martha Graham Dance Company, Hubbard Street Dance Chicago and Alonzo King's Lines Ballet, with young collectives that are generating buzz, like TU Dance out of St. Paul and Ate9 from Los Angeles.

(Brian Schaefer) American Realness (through Jan. 17) Since its debut in 2010, the American Realness festival has been a popular purveyor of audacious work by contemporary performance artists. Artistic categories here are fluid (like identity, as many of these artists would argue), but the more dance-inspired offerings include Jaamil Olawale Kosoko's ""#negrophobia,"" an exploration of the black male experience in America (Friday through Monday), Jillian Pena's ""Panopticon"" (Saturday through Jan. 17, in partnership with the COIL festival), ""Sara (the smuggler),"" a solo performed by veteran performance artist Sara Shelton Mann (Monday through Jan. 13), and Antonio Ramos and the Gang Busters with ""Mira El!,"" a dissection of gender (Tuesday through Jan. 15).

""Short Form,"" as the program is called, includes five new and revised works highlighting Ms. Parson's choreographic voice, imaginatively interwoven and festively interrupted by an intermission disguised as a birthday bash. Wednesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Siobhan Burke)

Alison Chase (Thursday through Jan. 17) Reflecting the current global refugee crisis, Alison Chase, a co-founder of Pilobolus, depicts a harrowing one-way journey in her new work, ""In the Forest of the Night."" Also part of her second New York season is ""Tracings,"" which uses bodies to invoke the Maine coastline where she lives. These join two repertory works, one that explores the cracks in a relationship and one that reimagines a Buddhist legend, all told with Ms. Chase's physical inventiveness and storytelling sensibilities. Thursday and next Friday at 8 p.m., Jan. 16 at 2 and 8 p.m., Jan. 17 at 2 p.m., Five Angels Theater, 789 10th Avenue, near 52nd Street, Clinton, alisonchase.org/nyc2016.

At 7:30 p.m., 70 Mulberry Street, Chinatown, chendancecenter.org. (Schaefer)  Coil Festival (through Jan. 17) The annual performance jubilee from Performance Space 122 has always been a boundary buster, but at this year's festival, an explicit theme is borders, as in questioning, crossing and erasing them. Among the dance artists taking that mission to heart are Jillian Pena, who uses mirrors to play with perspective in ""Panopticon"" (Saturday through Jan. 17); David Neumann, with a narrative-driven dive in personal turmoil called ""I understand everything better"" (Sunday through Jan. 15); the Norwegian artists Findlay//Sandsmark + Pettersen, presenting a meditation on dying (Tuesday through Jan. 17); and the Australian duo of Helen Herbertson and Ben Cobham with ""Morphia Series,"" inspired by the Greek god of dreams, and tailored to an intimate audience of a dozen (Wednesday through Jan. 16). At various times and locations; a full schedule and details are at ps122.org/coil-2016. (Schaefer)  Company XIV (through Jan. 17) If the traditional ""Nutcracker"" evokes the transition from childhood to adolescence, then Company XIV's ""Nutcracker Rouge"" might be the subsequent crossover into adulthood and the accompanying sexual awakening. The choreographer Austin McCormick combines a strong dose of burlesque, baroque and ballet with glittered pasties and G-strings for a charmingly sensual and playful holiday romp. Tchaikovsky never sounded so scandalous. Tuesdays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., Sundays at 5 p.m., Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, 800-745-3000, companyxiv.com. (Schaefer)  Danspace Project Commission Reprisals (Friday through Jan. 16) In the past 20 years, Danspace Project has commissioned nearly 500 works, and it's starting 2016 by remounting four recent ones. Netta Yerushalmy's ""Helga and the Three Sailors"" features a solo performed by Ms. Yerushalmy in front of video clips of her as a child in her native Israel (Friday). In ""White,"" Michelle Boule applies theories of quantum mechanics and BioGeometry to spatial relations in dance (Saturday).

Excognito Dance Festival (Friday through Jan. 18) This Brooklyn-based festival alternates between mixed-bill programs featuring the three participating companies, and programs where each gets the stage all to itself. Belinda McGuire performs solos created for her by Doug Varone, Idan Sharabi and Sharon Moore (and one of her own); the choreographer Joshua Beamish introduces two new works in his quirky, fluid style; and in its single company show, LoudHoundMovement presents ""In the Plague of Dreams,"" based on a story about an oppressed town. At various times, the Actors Fund Arts Center, 160 Schermerhorn Street, Boerum Hill, 800-838-3006, excognitodance.com. (Schaefer) Guangdong Song and Dance Ensemble (through Sunday) This company from China makes its American debut with ""Dragon Boat Racing,"" a glossy production that recounts the origins of a popular Cantonese musical composition. That tale is also a dramatic love story, expressed in part through large-scale, unison dance numbers that draw from ballet and traditional Chinese forms.

(Burke) 'Intensio' (through Sunday) Daniil Simkin, one of American Ballet Theater's most pyrotechnic stars, has been staying busy in the off-season. For this high-profile side project, he commissioned four contemporary works by Gregory Dolbashian, Alexander Ekman, Jorma Elo and Annabelle Lopez Ochoa. At the program's Jacob's Pillow premiere last summer, the best part was the cast, which includes seven of Mr. Simkin's Ballet Theater peers and Celine Cassone of Les Ballets Jazz de Montreal. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, 212-242-0800, joyce.org. (Burke)  Noche Flamenca (through Jan. 23) Traditional Spanish dance and ancient Greek theater are an unlikely but well-suited pair in Noche Flamenca's sharp production ""Antigona,"" based on Sophocles's famous tragedy. The dance lights a fire under the play while discovering in itself a knack for narrative drama. In the title role, the powerhouse Soledad Barrio is both fierce and fragile. The century-old church where the performance takes place is filled with striking sets, darkly amorous music played by a live band and a ferocious Greek chorus of dancers. Mondays through Saturdays at 8 p.m., West Park Presbyterian Church, 165 West 86th Street, Manhattan, 866-811-4111, nocheflamenca.com. (Schaefer)  Donna Uchizono (Friday, Saturday and Wednesday through Jan. 16) Ms. Uchizono's new work, ""Sticky Majesty,"" both welcomes and parses an array of conflicting sociopolitical views, in ways more covert than readily apparent, folded into structure and form. A nontraditional seating arrangement ensures that there's no reigning outlook on the world inhabited by her excellent cast, which includes the dancers Hadar Ahuvia, Sarah Iguchi, Molly Lieber, Heather Olson and Meg Weeks.

So far, they've all been abstract. His first narrative work, based on the Hans Christian Andersen story ""The Most Incredible Thing,"" arrives in February. At this preview event, Mr. Peck, the composer Bryce Dessner and the designers Marcel Dzama and Brandon Stirling Baker will chat about their collaboration while a handful of City Ballet dancers perform excerpts.

Travel,Multi-Mountain Passes Upended the American Ski Trip. Here Are 9 Rules.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/25/travel/ski-pass-multi-mountain.html,"For decades, ski vacations followed a predictable pattern, and it went a little like this: pick a mountain, book accommodations, fly or drive to the resort, buy lift tickets, ski a few days, return home. Repeat cycle the following year. The past few years have seen an explosion in passes that let holders ski and ride multiple mountains across North America (and beyond) free or at discounted rates. In turn, they have encouraged a new kind of ski trip in which people sample several hills in a single season. In February, for instance, I flew west from my Brooklyn home on two separate occasions and skied for 10 days. On seven of them I used a $409 Mountain Collective pass that let me ski free at Alta, Utah; Jackson Hole, Wyo.; and Big Sky, Mont. The walk-up rates for lift tickets would have run more than $1,000. And I was a light user. During the 2018-2019 season, MeiMei Ma, a Raleigh, N.C., resident who is ""over 60,"" as she put it, combined a Mountain Collective and a $599 Ikon Base pass for 42 days at 9 resorts, while Mary Ellen Charles, 62, from the southern Adirondacks in New York, logged 70 days at 18 resorts, most of them using either an Ikon or a Mountain Collective pass.

""The passes make it like a numbers game: How many days can we get in now?"" said Leah Hoffer, of Orange County, Calif. Using ""Costco tickets or something like that,"" Ms. Hoffer and her family used to take a single weeklong ski trip a year. Ikon passes in hand, they now do two of those plus several extended weekends. Those lucky enough to live in or near a ski town have the luxury of being able to jump in their car and hit the slopes with minimal forethought. For the rest of us, here are some tips to make the most of the new American ski trip.

By far the most efficient state when it comes to clusters is Colorado. Epic's Vail, Beaver Creek, Keystone and Breckenridge resorts are within an hour's drive of each other; Ikon's Copper Mountain, Arapahoe Basin and Winter Park are within an hour of each other; you can even tag a half-day at Eldora, a smaller mountain close to Boulder, before or after a flight at the Denver airport. 2. Let go of the condo-on-the-slopes dream Stephen Davis, 38, liked Breckenridge so much when he skied it using his Epic pass that he ended up buying a slopeside timeshare there. The York, Pa., resident continues to resort-hop, though, and projects he will ski 35 days in 2019-2020 with a combination of Epic and Ikon passes, using his timeshare and other assorted lodgings. But as convenient as slopeside lodging is when you are skiing one mountain, it's pricey and may not make sense if you're driving between mountains. You're better off at a midpoint that allows easy access to each resort. ""We look for the sweet price spot between affordability and access,"" said Ms. Hoffer, 34, who travels with her husband, David, 52, and their 6-year-old daughter, Lily. They stay less than 30 minutes from the lifts. ""But that can be just five miles -- we're talking mountain roads in winter time after all,"" she said. In Utah, when skiing the resorts in the Cottonwood canyons, I stay in the valley, on the edge of Salt Lake, 15 to 20 miles from the base areas. In Colorado, the towns of Frisco and Dillon, on either side of the Dillon Reservoir along I-70, are good options when skiing the Vail-Keystone-Breckenridge or Copper Mountain-Arapahoe Basin clusters. One bonus: Resort employees tend to live off-mountain, and towns like those are where you'll meet them, ready to dispense helpful tips if you ask nicely. On my first visit to Aspen Snowmass, I shared an Airbnb in nearby, affordable Basalt with an instructor who advised me to leave my car at the public lot and take the free shuttle to the base areas in order to avoid the resorts' exorbitant parking fees.

A skiing road trip requires some advance planning because accommodations near resorts can book up fast. You also need to factor in the general constraints of winter travel. When going from one resort to the next, try not to schedule too much driving after a ski day. Not only will you be tired but it's not a great idea to negotiate possibly icy, possibly unfamiliar roads in the dark. In February I drove solo from Jackson Hole to Big Sky after a day of skiing. In normal conditions this takes just under four hours but I decided to spend the night in West Yellowstone, Mont., on the way. That turned out to be a good move because that evening a whiteout in negative-digit temperatures hit the area. The less time spent on a frigid mountain road with no cell reception, the better. Google Maps' estimated drive times are a great tool to devise itineraries, but look at the fine print, and then check again right before getting behind the wheel: Will you have to go over potentially dicey passes? Has there just been an accident on I-70 which gets incredibly congested during ski season? 4. But be ready to improvise Because you don't have to buy lift tickets ahead of time to lock in advance-booking discounts, having a pass can free you up to make changes without paying a steep penalty. In the winter of 2018, I had booked a trip from New York to Salt Lake City to ski Utah with my wife and a friend. As our departure date approached, we realized that the state had little snow but that Wyoming, a five-hour drive away, looked encouraging. A week before we were due to leave, we canceled our Utah lodgings (which had a flexible cancellation policy, so we only lost the Airbnb fee of about $50) and rebooked in Driggs, Idaho -- a good base from which to ski Jackson Hole (which was on our Mountain Collective pass) and Grand Targhee (which was not but where lift tickets are relatively cheap). Heading north, we sacrificed a ski day to check out some idiosyncratic Idaho destinations -- Pocatello's Museum of Clean and the Idaho Potato Museum in Blackfoot. We also wolfed down textbook burgers and fries at Ole's Diner in Sugar City, which belongs on any road trip worth its sodium and American cheese. 5. Go for the S.U.V. Snow is great when skiing and terrible when driving, so don't skimp: rent an S.U.V. Being able to pull down a back seat also means that if you have your own gear, it will fit in the vehicle -- no need to rent a roof rack.

Sometimes you don't want to retrace your steps at the end of the trip, so flying into one airport and out of another makes sense -- that is, if you can find a deal on a one-way rental. In February, I was able to get an S.U.V. from Budget in Jackson and return it in Bozeman, Mont., without a penalty. The catch was that I didn't have unlimited mileage, but after mapping out the trip on Google, it was clear the cost would be minimal. I ended up paying less than $400 for five days, which is not bad for a one-way S.U.V. No matter what, take a photo of the dashboard to get evidence of mileage and gas both when you pick up the car and when you return it. Like many New Yorkers, I don't own a car -- yet each year I renew my AAA membership. I mostly use it for various discounts but it came in handy when my rental wouldn't start on my first morning in Jackson. AAA dispatched a tow truck that got me to the Budget office (which, luckily, was less than five miles away, the maximum distance for free towing on my plan). I was given new wheels and took off for the Jackson Hole slopes. The very next day, I was calling AAA again after locking myself out of the car -- something I had not done in 30 years -- in the resort's parking lot.

7. Think about your impact In a number of places in the West, the passes have been blamed for overcrowding at resorts and traffic jams on the roads and slopes. By the Jackson Hole tram I saw a sticker with a red slash through the world ""Ikon"" and in Colorado there were reports of ""Stop Ikonizing Aspen"" stickers. Western resorts claimed record attendance last year, which was also a good one for snowfall, as they have noted, so it can be difficult to tease out the total impact of the passes. But visitors can also try to limit their footprint by making better choices. For one, in many places you can resist adding to traffic by using public transportation. The Ski Utah app helps navigate the buses that service the Cottonwood resorts and ensure that you actually make it to the lifts -- last season, several resorts turned away individual cars because the parking lots were full by midmorning. Some of the fancier mountains, like Aspen Snowmass, Vail and Park City, in Utah, offer excellent and free shuttle systems. Several bus options link Frisco and Dillon to nearby resorts.

Ms. Charles, the Adirondacks resident, happily recalls a trip with a friend that included Copper Mountain on the Ikon pass. Traffic getting to the mountain was terrible one morning so the women instead took the bus three stops to the nearby Keystone, to which she had discounted access through Vermont's Okemo, which had just joined the Epic group. The weather was so bad that part of I-70 closed down. ""It snowed six inches so we had a private powder day because nobody else made it to the resort,"" Ms. Charles said. If you plan to hop from one resort to another, bringing your own skis or snowboard is much more convenient because it means less time in rental shops -- a hassle that can be compounded if you're not staying near the shop and something turns out to be defective. Lisa Sebastiano, 54, from Upton, Mass., has used an Ikon pass near her home in New England , and at farther-flung mountains. But even when flying west, solo or with her family, she takes her gear. As her traveling and her total number of ski days have gone up thanks to her pass, avoiding rentals costs is cost-effective. ""It's far, far less expensive to bring our skis out and back, and we have skis that we know and that are appropriate,"" she said, echoing a common sentiment among fellow winter trippers. You can keep the luggage fees under control by flying Southwest (two free bags!), using an airline credit card or packing efficiently -- I cram my clothes, a pair of skis and a pair of poles into a padded, wheeled double bag; boots and helmet go in the carry-on.",The passes have encouraged fans of snow sports to visit more than one mountain on a vacation. Here's how to navigate the new landscape.,91bc2fde-0c2a-5b00-bac2-edcafbc25916,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/25/travel/25new-ski-trip01/25new-ski-trip01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=8d18eaa7b237d7a3a7bf6f552c554c4f5a678fbc6bdd76815fa78eaa3ba5fa42&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Squaw Valley Alpine Meadows ski resort, near Lake Tahoe, holders of the Ikon multi-mountain pass get unlimited access.",91bc2fde-0c2a-5b00-bac2-edcafbc25916,N24News/imgs/91bc2fde-0c2a-5b00-bac2-edcafbc25916.jpg,4
Real Estate,Working and Living in a Bushwick Gallery,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/06/realestate/working-and-living-in-a-bushwick-gallery.html,"When Montana Simone first saw the turn-of-the-century horse stable in Bushwick, Brooklyn, that would become her art gallery and home, she scarcely noticed that a handful of space heaters provided the only warmth, or that the wind blew into the front room under a gap of several inches beneath the barn door. ""I was like, 'Wow, there is nothing wrong with this space!'"" she said. ""Which stuck with me, because I'm usually very critical about how people set up their spaces."" Ms. Simone said that, having grown up in a series of lofts and loftlike spaces in San Francisco, Sonoma, Calif., and Grenoble, France, surrounded by huge weavings done by her artist mother, her domestic ideal diverges somewhat from the norm.

""Most apartments feel really suburban to me, like what a friend's parents would live in,"" she said. ""They're like TV sets, like something out of a sitcom. It's hard for me to imagine people actually living there."" Montana Simone created an apartment in her gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Liz Barclay for The New York Times The white box gallery where she spent the last two years living and working is tucked behind an auto body shop and across from a tortilla factory on an industrial thoroughfare by the Bushwick-Williamsburg border. Though the area has little foot traffic, Ms. Simone estimates that visitors to the gallery number in the high hundreds each month. She has hosted 10 to 12 art show installations a year there, as well as dance and sound art performances, concerts, experimental film screenings, panels, lectures and events ranging from figure-drawing sessions to essential-oils classes. The first floor is largely given over to a high-ceilinged exhibition space, sparsely furnished with plants and stylish castoffs, including a working upright piano. Behind a door sits an overflowing office, which leads to a bathroom and a small, windowless room where, until last week, she slept and stored her clothes. Downstairs in the finished basement are four art studios, a small kitchen, a stage and an exhibition area. She took the space over from a friend who, feeling burned out after having tried to make a go of running a gallery there for several years, moved to Woodstock, N.Y. Ms. Simone was staying with the friend in Woodstock in the fall of 2014, having just returned from filming a project about radical hospitality in the Middle East, the Mediterranean and Europe -- deliberately visiting countries ""typically labeled as hostile"" to document the generosity of their hosting traditions.

Hesitant about resuming the life she had left behind in the city (bartending to pay the bills and carving out time for artistic projects on the side), she remembered how taken she had been with the gallery space. She went to Bushwick the day after Christmas two years ago, sleeping on the floor of the gallery and eating Thai food as she mulled the possibilities. ""I had never thought about having a gallery,"" she said. ""But I fell in love with curating."" But running a gallery has been onerous as well as fulfilling. Making the rent, for one, is a frequent source of stress. She pays $3,700 a month, and an additional $200 in utilities. As a commercial tenant, she must also pay $2,200 a year in real estate taxes and $1,200 annually in liability insurance to host public events there. The art studios downstairs rent for $500 to $1,000 a month; she and her nonprofit gallery must generate the remainder. And as much as she has enjoyed fostering other artists' creative endeavors -- a show by the multimedia artist Azikiwe Mohammed, who explores black American identity and experience, opens later this month -- running and living in the gallery has left her with little time for her own projects. ""I don't want to be available to every single person who walks in anymore,'"" she said. "" I'm 28. I have two years left until I'm 30. I want to do my own work."" So in late December, busy with preparations for the installation of her radical hospitality project, which will open in the gallery this spring, she moved into a friend's apartment in nearby Broadway Junction where she'll pay $750 a month. Her room at the gallery will revert to a studio that she will rent out. She had worried about the legality of living in the space anyway, although shop owners and artists have lived in the backs of their spaces for centuries.",A gallery owner used an old horse stable to host art shows and performances — all while living in a back room.,a3638861-6b3b-5293-9ed8-89992712cd93,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/08/realestate/08RENTERS1/08RENTERS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=55dc7723ec51f74ef01020b893ba0df9d3eefcdd23102315beaed14fa695de14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Montana Simone in her gallery, a former turn-of-the-century horse stable in Bushwick, Brooklyn.",a3638861-6b3b-5293-9ed8-89992712cd93,N24News/imgs/a3638861-6b3b-5293-9ed8-89992712cd93.jpg,7
Books,The Merman of Her Dreams,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/books/review/broder-pisces.html," writes about the void. She approaches the great existential subjects -- emptiness, loneliness, meaninglessness, death and boyfriends -- as if they were a collection of bad habits. That's what makes her writing so funny. And so sad. @sosadtoday is, in fact, the name of Broder's popular Twitter feed, a place of quick, witty personal koans of lively despair. The tweets inspired ""So Sad Today,"" a book of personal essays that negotiated a comical, uneasy struggle with aging, sex and death. In ""The Pisces,"" her first novel, Broder expands her personal, plaintive mythology of love troubles, sexual siren songs and the inevitable march toward oblivion. The ideal boyfriend -- beautiful, unattainable, inappropriately younger -- becomes literally mythic. That hot surfer swimming up to the rocks every night to chat? He's a merman. Lucy, the 38-year-old narrator, has taken shelter in her sister's glass house on Venice Beach after a disastrous breakup in Phoenix. She's left behind a dissertation she no longer believes in; a dreary grad-school job; an empty, aimless, passionless relationship. Nine years of what has come to feel like stifling mediocrity. A desert, in other words. Lucy seems to trudge through life accidentally on purpose. After breaking up with her boyfriend, she busts his nose and nearly overdoses on Ambien and doughnuts in a passive fury. She accepts her sister's offer to dog-sit and house-sit for the summer with a sigh of tempered relief. She likes the ""sparse"" glass house where she can ""disappear in a good way: as if never having existed, unlike the way I felt I was disappearing ... in my hot, cluttered apartment in Phoenix, ... suffocating in what was mine."" It is only when describing Dominic, her sister's diabetic foxhound, that Lucy seems fully at peace. She loves his ears and ""the crook of his neck, just under the jaw, where his skin was soft and loose. ... I spent most of my time with him with my head burrowed in that spot. I could have lived there.""

She tears herself away from the dog only to attend group therapy. And what a group -- an assortment of eccentric, tragic and highly amusing women trying to free themselves from their obsessive, self-destructive pursuit of awful men. This is everyone's nightmare of group therapy, a circle of triumphantly maladjusted West Coast lady victims. One is ""not only sensitive to men, but also to light, cleaning products, mold, pollen, gluten, dairy and sugar."" Another complains that her boss is emotionally abusive, but when asked to describe what happened, she says: ""It's just a feeling. ... It's my truth."" Broder deftly catches the victims of victimhood in her satirical glance, but she also recognizes frailty when she sees it, and as her Venice life continues Lucy realizes she may not be so different from the women she initially finds so ridiculous. The title of Lucy's abandoned thesis is ""The Accentual Gap: Sappho's Spaces as Essence,"" and its argument is that the blanks in Sappho's surviving work should not be filled with and co-opted by conjecture; they should read as if Sappho meant them to be there. ""I, myself, had a very complicated relationship with emptiness, blankness, nothingness,"" Lucy explains. ""Sometimes I wanted only to fill it, frightened that if I didn't it would eat me alive or kill me. But sometimes I longed for total annihilation in it -- a beautiful, silent erasure."" Sex and death. Fill the void, or join it. Lucy mediates this existential quandary with a nihilistic abandon that involves Tinder and a series of meticulously detailed examples of terrible sex. Broder's (and Lucy's) persona is full of shame, for everything, yet one characteristic of her writing is an almost exhibitionistic insistence on describing body parts and body functions (particularly but not exclusively sex) as if they were shoes in a shop window, examined, tried on, put back. The shoes themselves might be beautiful or they might be ugly, they might be too tight, they might cause blisters, they might look glamorous at first but tawdry later. They may make you taller when you wear them, but life is still short. Lucy on her Tinder tear is a victim, Broder suggests, but she is not talking about sexual harassment. This is a different #MeToo, a compulsive drive to find love, or at least to stop the pain of lovelessness. That nebbishy Uber driver? She goes after him. The smug guy in the hotel bathroom? The painful anal intercourse? The hopes dashed, over and over again? It's a sordid life Lucy pursues in Los Angeles, but she is the one pursuing it. Broder describes these episodes as the behavior of addiction.

Lucy's years of uncomplaining, unfulfilling monogamy do not prepare us for her drop into actively self-destructive sex addiction. Broder does not identify a moment when all hell breaks loose, or even differentiate the early Lucy sexually plodding along in desert Arizona from Venice Beach Lucy on the down-and-dirty prowl. But Broder carries us along, even as we shake our heads. The book is uneven, but it has great momentum, like waves hitting the rocks. And it is in the waves on the rocks, not on Tinder, that Lucy finally meets Theo, her fairy-tale prince. Except he's not a prince. He's half fish. Theo is as unthreatening and sympathetic as the lovely creature in ""The Shape of Water."" He is boyish without being a boy. Or a man. He is instead the embodiment of an impossibly pure desire. The sex between Lucy and Theo is described less as a materialistic evaluation than as an enchantment, an embrace of and escape from all the emptiness the universe can throw their way. It is not just sex, it is lovemaking. Mermen, luckily, have all the necessary equipment, but even Broder's painstaking description of Theo's physical glory is focused on the magic of the transition of flesh to fin, rather than his organ. (Though we do learn it is uncircumcised, in case you were wondering.) Broder's preoccupations -- and sometimes her prose -- mirror her essays and poetry and tweets, but she has also allowed her social-media style and substance to blossom. ""The Pisces"" is part satire, part fairy tale and, sometimes jarringly, part meditation on addiction. Lucy longs for what is unattainable in life and so is drawn to the soothing darkness of death. She is an idealist who can't help noticing that nothing is ideal. It's interesting, and touching, that the two objects of deep, un-self-conscious love in Broder's novel are not human: Dominic the dog and Theo the merman. She ultimately disappoints both the creatures she loves, one out of weakness, one out of strength. Lucy herself, it turns out, is all too human.","In Melissa Broder's novel, ""The Pisces,"" a depressed graduate student meets her fairy-tale prince — who happens to be half fish.",5cafd980-bc01-5027-a25c-05f153b8398e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/17/books/17Schine2/08Schine2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=56f7f0cef17f47a492a47ddb55cdee9e77d6d9ae703701fd4c22ba95d997979d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Melissa Broder,5cafd980-bc01-5027-a25c-05f153b8398e,N24News/imgs/5cafd980-bc01-5027-a25c-05f153b8398e.jpg,13
Media,"Hollywood Loves Sequels, Even in the Executive Suite",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/11/business/media/hollywood-executives.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Grand. Gutsy. Godlike. In the popular imagination, studio chiefs embody all of those qualities -- volcano-tempered rulers who blurt out things like, ""We're gonna make you a star, kid,"" and alter careers, and maybe even film history, in a hot second. But the reality of the modern-day studio boss is much more mundane. Largely gone are the days of swashbuckling moguls with offices big enough to accommodate Cleopatra's barge. Instead, the job has become corporate in the extreme -- answering to parent-company boards, serving up sequels so related merchandise keeps selling, cutting costs as DVD money vanishes. The real fun (and profit) for much of the Type A executive set has migrated up the coast to Silicon Valley. So when the former 20th Century Fox chairman James N. Gianopulos was tapped to take over the struggling Paramount Pictures -- he started last week -- it was no surprise. In an industry that tries to thrill audiences, the identities of the studio chairmen are almost mind-numbingly predictable. Of Hollywood's eight biggest film suppliers, five are managed by someone who has held the same job at another one of those companies.

Alan F. Horn was forcibly retired from Warner Bros. Now he runs Walt Disney Studios. Thomas E. Rothman was pushed out at Fox. Now he reigns at Sony. Stacey Snider, now leading Fox, formerly ran Universal. Adam Fogelson? Ousted by Universal, and currently STX Entertainment's movie chief. These are all talented executives who know the movie business inside and out -- no small qualification in such a unique mix of art and commerce. Mr. Horn, in particular, has led Disney to astounding success. But why does Hollywood keep recycling its studio bosses? The question has been percolating in the movie capital since Paramount hired Mr. Gianopulos. With pretty much everyone agreeing that the film business needs shaking up (the analyst Michael Nathanson released a report last week titled, ""Film Industry: Don't Just Stand There, Do Something!""), why did Paramount go with the tried and true? In a column for the trade news outlet Deadline.com, Peter Bart, who was Variety's editor in chief for two decades, was generally supportive of Mr. Gianopulos. But Mr. Bart also seemed to side with Tom Freston, the highly regarded former Viacom chief executive, whom Mr. Bart quoted as saying that, if he were taking over an entertainment company today, he would ""hire a motorcycle gang of rule breakers to reinvent the whole business.""

As Mr. Bart noted, ""Gianopulos, thoughtful and cautious, does not fit that description."" Hollywood loves nothing more than a sequel. In a topsy-turvy business where new movies can cost $400 million to make and market, sequels are safe -- audiences are already familiar with them. The same holds true with film executives. As Janice Min, the former editor of The Hollywood Reporter, said in an email, hiring at ""these increasingly corporate studios"" does not involve innovation as much as self-protection.

""They hire people that have done it before,"" she wrote, ""so no boss or board can ever say they took a chance on someone without experience!""
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. Most studios are not in the business of building anything. They are about protecting what they have. So they go with the safe choice. Some longtime Hollywood observers point to other forces that keep the same names in circulation. Film companies are not known for grooming a new generation of strong leaders. It has been part of Hollywood's hard-knuckled executive culture dating back to those cigar-chomping moguls of yore -- take a hatchling under your wing, and they may well ""grow up to eat you,"" said Jeanine Basinger, author of ""The Star Machine"" and founder of Wesleyan University's film studies program. ""It's not something unique to Hollywood,"" she added. ""Show me the business -- or college, for that matter, or museum -- where the top man, and it's still almost always a man, aggressively grooms a successor."" To some degree, there is a limited pool of people who even want to run old-line studios. Some young turks see a better future in streaming companies. Scott Stuber, a producer whose credits include the comedy ""Ted,"" just took a senior job at Netflix. Others are more interested in building their own companies. (Jason Blum, the horror film impresario, is one example.) Others have plum jobs outside the lumbering studios.","The job of studio chief has become corporate in the extreme, one reason Hollywood is very predictable when it comes to who gets hired for those jobs.",d65447b7-7b58-51cc-b267-188801f32ec6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/12/business/00moviechairmen1/00moviechairmen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=398ef27d5e7ece864f472659fff275352f9009b6fee87d8556fc95e800573019&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"As the role of studio chairman has changed, studios have started recycling executives.

Books,Dick Cheney and Colin Powell: The Odd Couple,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/14/books/review/the-great-rift-dick-cheney-colin-powell-james-mann.html,"THE GREAT RIFT

Dick Cheney, Colin Powell, and the Broken Friendship That Defined an Era

By James Mann

They served separately at an ebb tide of postwar American power in the early 1970s, witnesses to defeat abroad and malaise at home. They served again as partners when American power peaked anew two decades later. ""We could finish each other's sentences,"" one fondly recalled. Entrusted with shepherding American power a third time, in the early 2000s, Dick Cheney and Colin Powell oversaw its erosion instead, leaving as their legacy a more divided, indebted and globally unpopular country than the one they'd inherited. Cheney's certainty ensured America's unraveling, especially when enabled by Powell's reluctance.

Their friendship eroded as well, which is the subject of James Mann's ""The Great Rift,"" his latest exploration of the personalities that shaped American national security policy over the past half-century. Cheney rose from reckless youth to White House power broker, first among equals (alongside Donald Rumsfeld) in Gerald Ford's administration. He later served, to the suspicion of some, as the true authority within George W. Bush's. Always more conservative than he let on (and he let on very little), Cheney executed others' visions with a cold confidence exceeded only by his bureaucratic acumen.

Powell's career coupled similar bureaucratic prowess with personal warmth. Witness to the Army's defeat in Vietnam, he scaled its ranks guided by a string of increasingly powerful mentors. Along the way, he helped articulate the lesson drawn by the Pentagon from the Southeast Asia debacle -- namely, that the United States should never again send its youth to war without three things: a clear objective, overwhelming force and political backing at home. Powell was less its author than its most eloquent advocate, but this ""Powell Doctrine"" guided American military thinking by the 1980s.

Their relationship blossomed during the first gulf war, under George H. W. Bush, when Cheney ran the Pentagon and Powell led the Joint Chiefs of Staff, together orchestrating a textbook implementation of the doctrine's required trinity. Cheney was certain America would win. Reluctant to deploy without sufficient material and political support from their civilian masters, Powell made sure it would.","James Mann's ""The Great Rift"" describes the up-and-down relationship of two men who shaped American foreign policy for a generation.",3c0b2e40-58e0-548b-80ea-c817189ceecb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/26/books/review/26Engel/26Engel-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=92bd9c59e0a14093d0edd5814c2450907e9ffa4b6fa01a8a5a22bd1dfcef88ff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dick Cheney and Colin Powell at a Pentagon briefing on the Persian Gulf, August, 1990.",3c0b2e40-58e0-548b-80ea-c817189ceecb,N24News/imgs/3c0b2e40-58e0-548b-80ea-c817189ceecb.jpg,13
Theater,Divorced. Beheaded. Broadway.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/01/theater/six-musical-broadway.html,"For centuries, the wives of England's King Henry VIII have been remembered largely for the ways their marriages came to an end.

Now comes a pair of young British theater-makers, Toby Marlow and Lucy Moss, with a revisionist take on those sorry stories: ""Six,"" a pop musical in which each woman gets, at least for a few minutes, to reframe her fame.

The show, long on wordplay (""Live in consort!"") and short on running time (80 minutes), is coming to Broadway next year. ""Six"" will begin performances Feb. 13 and open March 12 at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, produced by Kenny Wax, Wendy and Andy Barnes , George Stiles and Kevin McCollum.

""This is obviously the craziest thing that's ever happened to us,"" Ms. Moss, who is 25, said in an interview. She had never even seen a Broadway show until she visited New York earlier this year; Mr. Marlow, who is 24, had seen a few productions, starting with Cirque du Soleil's ""Paramour,"" and came up with the idea for ""Six"" while daydreaming during a poetry class at Cambridge University.","""Six,"" a British pop musical about the guess-how-many wives of Henry VIII, will open early next year.",7fa4f56b-1e8e-55ec-b9a5-f39d23a36e1c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/02/arts/00six-item1/00six-item1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=aea801680a417a822d01eebaad2e42e0ad732bf16239812177679522381ed2bd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The first North American production of &ldquo;Six&rdquo; is now running at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater, and will make stops in Massachusetts, Alberta and Minnesota before arriving on Broadway early next year.",7fa4f56b-1e8e-55ec-b9a5-f39d23a36e1c,N24News/imgs/7fa4f56b-1e8e-55ec-b9a5-f39d23a36e1c.jpg,10
Your Money,"For Some Retirees, a Second Act Is Easier Than Expected",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/07/your-money/for-retirees-a-second-career.html,"NEVER in a million years did Cheryl Delaney expect to spend her retirement working with the elderly. Her entire career had been in the financial sector -- as a bank officer and loan administrator, in collections and finally as an office manager at Fidelity Investments in Boston. Changing bedpans was not on her bucket list. But life unfolds in strange ways. In 2004, Ms. Delaney was looking for a new position in banking and visited retirementjobs.com, which offers job listings and career advice for people over 50. Three years later she decided to leave Fidelity and stop working full time. She did some administrative work, renovated her home in Milton, Mass., and was ""very happily retired."" Until she wasn't. By the end of 2012 she was paying way too much attention to her television set. ""My dogs were getting on my nerves,"" she said. She considered returning to work, but emphatically did not want to go to an office. Around the same time she got a call from Mature Caregivers, a sister site to retirementjobs.com. They were looking to place caregivers over 50, and had found her information in their database. Might she be interested?

""I said, 'I don't have medical experience,' "" Ms. Delaney, now 66, recalled. ""They said, 'You just need to have common sense.' "" A week later she went in for an interview. Today, she works four hours a day, five days a week, at Boylston Place, an assisted-living facility in Brookline, Mass. ""It's quite a switch,"" she said. Ms. Delaney's story is an object lesson for retirees. Many worry that their existing skills aren't applicable to new industries, that their expertise isn't transferable and that they will have to reinvent themselves to remain competitive. This, of course, can be overwhelming. ""There's a real myth around reinvention, particularly when you talk about people in their 60s and 70s,"" said Nancy Collamer of Old Greenwich, Conn., a semiretirement career expert and author of ""Second-Act Careers."" ""Why would you want to throw away all of that life and work and professional experience? It's so much more about reconfiguring, taking the old and blending it with the new and coming up with something that's going to excite you in the second half of the third quarter."" A 2008 AARP study found that 83 percent of workers were interested in programs to build new skills and advance their careers. Ninety percent, however, wanted training to update their current skills and knowledge. ""It's so much easier for people to do that if they can lean upon some aspect of what they did before,"" Ms. Collamer said. ""It doesn't mean if you've been an accountant in a corporate setting that you find another accounting job. The goal is to take a step back and look -- 'O.K., what is it about being an accountant that I really enjoyed?' You might discover that the thing you enjoyed most was going to the conference and meeting other people in the field.""

That's something Marie Ardito, learned about herself after retiring at 62 from teaching elementary and junior high school math. Two weeks into retirement she grew ""antsy"" and took a job as executive director of a retirement group. Now 77, Ms. Ardito is the information coordinator for Massachusetts Retirees United, a nonprofit group. A large part of her job involves conducting seminars and motivating retirees, many of whom are former educators. ""One of the things that drives me crazy is the comment, 'I can't do anything but teach,' "" Ms. Ardito said. ""I say, 'If you can relate to kids, normally you can relate to anyone.' The skills are transferable. I've met people who were teachers who are now working in hospital admissions -- they bring their caring skills, their knowledge of computers, of developing programs.""

To help people figure out how their old skills can be used in new ways, Encore.org coordinates a network of organizations offering a fellowship program. Applicants must have a minimum of 15 years of work experience, but typically have about 25 years, said the national director, Leslye Louie. During the fellowship period -- which lasts from six to 12 months, part time or full time -- participants receive $20,000 to $25,000 ($35,0000 in New York) for 1,000 hours. ""Oftentimes people don't even know how their skills are transferable -- that's the No. 1 reason people apply,"" said Ms. Louie, herself a former fellow. ""We spend a lot of time working with them on the change of culture, change of identity, how their skills might transfer. I think skills are lifetime assets, and ideally you're constantly acquiring them and using them.""
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' That is something Kathy Quiett discovered. A manufacturing technician at Intel in Rio Rancho, N.M., for over two decades, Ms. Quiett, 56, decided it was time to do something new. She applied for an Encore fellowship and was accepted. But when Ms. Louie asked her what kind of work she might enjoy, she was stuck. ""I said I liked to rescue small dogs and cats,"" recalled Ms. Quiett, who relocated to Melbourne, Fla., with her husband in November. Ms. Louie came back with an offer: How would she like to help open a sea turtle healing center at the Brevard Zoo, in Melbourne?

She jumped at the chance. Never mind that her previous work was not remotely related to animals (or water). ""They were looking for someone who could help when the turtles come to the zoo, to input into the computer whether or not they have certain diseases, what their name is, and so on, and I do have computer skills,"" she said. (Her duties also involve making sure their turtle's water has the right chemical balance, which she will have to learn.) Louisa B. Hellegers also used her old skills in new ways post-retirement. In November 2009, Ms. Hellegers, now 66, left her job as an editor at Cambridge University Press. She immediately took a volunteer job running the search committee for a music director for an amateur singing group in New Jersey. ""I had done a tremendous amount of hiring in my life before,"" said Ms. Hellegers, who lives in New York. ""I had honed my instincts on what you see in a resume and how that translates into how people fit into an organization."" About a year later, she applied to be an Encore fellow, and in the summer of 2011 she was placed at the Center for Employment Opportunities, a nonprofit agency in Manhattan that offers employment services for recently released prison inmates. Her job was to work on in-house staff development, which required editorial, interviewing, training and marketing skills. ""I was doing coaching and mentoring of people,"" she said. After her fellowship ended, Ms. Hellegers stayed on as director of organizational development. Last August she retired -- again -- and was planning to travel with her husband. But then she got a call from Encore. The director for the New York Encore Fellows program was leaving, and Encore wanted to know if she would be interested in taking the job. She was. No one is more surprised by her transition than she. ""When I left my old job I was told that I couldn't go anywhere but in publishing,"" she said. ""It wasn't until I did the music director search that I started to realize, 'Wow these skills were really transferable.' "" Ms. Delaney says that everything she learned about caring for the elderly she learned on Wall Street. At Fidelity, for example, a large part of her job was about supporting a trading floor of 325 people. ""I learned patience,"" she said. ""A lot of times the traders would be very frustrated and use foul language. I'd have to get tough with them."" At her current job, she said, one of her clients is very difficult and often tries to hit her. Her background has helped her here, too. ""When he puts a fist up, I'll say, 'You're in big trouble if that hits me,' "" she said. ""He knows that I won't take his nonsense. I learned that from the Wall Street guys. Have you ever been around an angry trader who had a bad trading day? It can get really ugly.""","Skills honed during decades spent in one career can be relevant to strikingly different positions, experts say.",52d7f185-551b-5bfe-954a-c594981e3066,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/07/business/Retiring/Retiring-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=389&w=600&s=8505a612879045529cd4532cd65cfd6ffb01fce01feb882ea9f23227c366330c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Cheryl Delaney says that patience, a skill learned managing a floor of traders at an investment firm, helps in her new role as caregiver.",52d7f185-551b-5bfe-954a-c594981e3066,N24News/imgs/52d7f185-551b-5bfe-954a-c594981e3066.jpg,21
Automobiles,"Nissan Recalls 990,000 Vehicles for Air Bag Malfunction",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/27/automobiles/nissan-recalls-990000-cars-and-trucks-for-air-bag-malfunction.html,"In the fifth huge recall for automakers this year, Nissan is recalling nearly a million vehicles, including 544,000 Altima sedans, because the front passenger-side air bag might not deploy in a crash, the company said in a report to regulators published on Wednesday.

The problem, on vehicles in the 2013-14 model years, stems from a federally mandated system intended to determine whether the front passenger seat is occupied -- and turn off the air bag if it is not -- or if a small child is seated there.

Nissan told the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration that a software problem in the occupant classification system might not detect an occupant in that seat. The automaker blamed the sensitivity of the software calibration, particularly when ""a combination of factors such as high engine vibration at idle when the seat is initially empty and then becomes occupied"" or an ""unusual"" seating posture are factors.

The report said the automaker was aware of three accidents in which the passenger air bag did not deploy in a crash even though the seat was said to be occupied. Nissan is not aware of any fatalities involving the problem, Steve Yaeger, a Nissan spokesman, wrote in an email. He said he did not know if any injuries were associated with the defect.",A software problem in some 2013-14 Nissan and Infiniti models could keep a front passenger air bag from deploying in a collision.,a3d596fa-637a-5b80-8fa2-bd14ea0c1f0c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/27/business/Nissan/Nissan-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=289&w=600&s=c287527274d0fdd9d29255f357e25ac1addd326c078b0d3252c12c777310de13&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"About 183,000 Sentra compacts from the model year 2013 are being recalled because of possible air bag problems.",a3d596fa-637a-5b80-8fa2-bd14ea0c1f0c,N24News/imgs/a3d596fa-637a-5b80-8fa2-bd14ea0c1f0c.jpg,23
Technology,Using Tech Tools to Do Data Reporting,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/technology/personaltech/a-times-reporters-favorite-tech-tools-for-work-and-home.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Claire Cain Miller, a writer for The Upshot, discussed the tech she's using. As a reporter at The Upshot, you use a lot of data to write analysis on gender, families and the future of work. What kind of tech setup do you use to sift through the data for stories? Much of reporting on data is no different from other reporting, though it includes a little more Excel. It still requires reading, talking to sources and writing (and Twitter).

I recently started using Google Keep for note-taking, and it's made working much more efficient. I'd tried a lot of note-taking apps but didn't like any of them, so I used to record random ideas on Post-it notes or by sending myself emails -- which usually just led to things getting lost. Now I have notes with titles like ""story ideas,"" ""gender sources"" and ""books to read,"" and can easily access them from anywhere. My sanity at work has been much improved by Slack. The Upshot team is spread across the country but we're able to have a running conversation all day.

You recently wrote an article about raising a feminist son. You point out that while daughters nowadays are told they can be anything they want -- astronauts, tomboys and girlie girls -- boys are still encouraged to be tough and masculine. In light of this, how do you think you will introduce tech to your sons?

My boys are 5 and 1, so luckily video games haven't been an issue yet. But I assume we'll take the same approach we have with other media -- screening them for appropriateness, limiting exposure to violence and stereotypes, and offering options with positive messages and role models. Also, having conversations about what they see, because even if they're not seeing it at home, they're picking it up everywhere else. Tech and media companies seem to get this. Common Sense Media -- whose app I use all the time to find out if movies, apps or books are appropriate -- just started rating movies on gender stereotypes. So far, our oldest son is most into streaming science shows like ""Octonauts"" and ""Planet Earth."" He also just started listening to podcasts for kids, like Wow in the World and Stories Podcast, which is a great alternative to screen time.

Beyond your job, what tech products are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life? What do you and your family do with them? We finally cut the cord last year, and watch TV only with Apple TV and apps. But every night, I wish it were easier to use -- I crave a simple guide that shows you where the show you want is available and how to stream it. We use our iPads mostly as very expensive white noise machines, and in the kitchen for recipes. (NYT Cooking has displaced all my cookbooks lately, especially now that I can save recipes from other sites to my recipe box on the app.)

I've been lamenting how few pictures ever make it off our phones, so I've started printing more straight from my phone with Shutterfly or Print Studio, and ordering framed prints using the Keepsake app. I'm impressed by how fast, affordable and good-looking Keepsake's framed photos are. Two kids and two jobs often feels impossible, so I'm obsessed with apps that cut down on the time spent doing household chores. Some of our most-used apps are Instacart for groceries and Caviar and Postmates for food delivery. I used the Diapers.com app religiously for all our household supplies, and I'm still in mourning since Amazon shut it down in April. Google products have been seeping into more parts of my life -- I've recently added Keep and Photos, because I tried other services but they're the best I found. I don't love the idea of one company having so much visibility into my life (especially as a former Google beat reporter), but this is the constant compromise we make with tech companies. You wrote about how Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods signaled the replacement of cashiers in retail stores with automated technologies. Would this be a good or a bad thing? Even if entire occupations might not disappear anytime soon, parts of many jobs will be automated -- not just ones we've already seen in factories and warehouses but also professional and service jobs. (Just think how much the internet and software have changed our jobs as journalists.) Often, this is a good thing for businesses and for consumers, who might save money or get things more efficiently, but it has consequences -- most urgently for workers who lose their jobs. I don't hear many people arguing that technological progress, from Amazon or anyone else, should be halted. But I think it's clear that the workers whose jobs change or disappear need assistance, and that's an area where public policy can help.","Telling stories with data requires many of the same tools as other kinds of reporting, says an Upshot writer, Claire Cain Miller.",edb1da1a-2eb6-59b4-aa20-51ef65dc157f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/02/business/03TECHUSING1/03TECHUSING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=25639596ddb34f91ff191876f2d899c8e61d0b4179b7e3934b09658e6701dcf8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Claire Cain Miller taking pictures of her children, Tiller Cain, 1, and Auden Cain, 5.

Art & Design,Art Dealer Sentenced to 18 Months in Prison for Fraud,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/arts/design/art-dealer-sentenced-to-18-months-in-prison-for-fraud.html,"Ezra Chowaiki was sentenced Thursday in federal court in Manhattan to 18 months in prison and three years of supervised release for defrauding art dealers and collectors of millions of dollars. He was also ordered to give up his interest in more than 20 works of art involved in the fraud, including pieces by Picasso and Alexander Calder.

He will have to pay restitution in an amount that will be determined in 90 days.

As the owner of a now-closed Manhattan art gallery, Chowaiki & Co., Mr. Chowaiki made a series of fraudulent deals to buy and sell artwork from 2015 to 2017. During this period, he transferred more than $16 million of artwork under false pretenses.

""He sold clients' artwork without authorization, and he took clients' money for the purchase of artwork he never purchased,"" Geoffrey S. Berman, United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement released after the sentence was passed. Judge Jed S. Rakoff presided.

Automobiles,"Like an Aging Elvis, Star Retains Its Power",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/automobiles/autoreviews/like-an-aging-elvis-star-retains-its-power.html,"Mercedes-Benz couldn't have known it at the time. But from the moment the SL300 flashed its novel gullwing doors at the New York auto show of 1954, this sports car began building Mercedes from an American obscurity into the luxury powerhouse it is today. Mercedes hadn't planned to build street versions of the SL racecars that heralded its triumphant postwar return to motorsports. But after securing a promised order for hundreds of cars from Max Hoffman, the influential New York-based importer who also convinced Porsche and BMW to create sports cars for Americans, Mercedes approved production of the SL. That coupe, followed by a roadster, became a Hollywood star through associations with celebrities like Clark Gable and Natalie Wood. Movie cameos followed, from the SL's appearance as a racecar in Elvis Presley's ""Viva Las Vegas"" to Grace Kelly driving Frank Sinatra in one in ""High Society."" A year ago, a rare alloy-body SL300 Gullwing fetched a record $4.6 million at a Gooding & Company auction in Arizona. Like Mercedes itself -- or Elvis in a jump suit -- the modern SL has grown fat, rich and happy. Now sold exclusively as a hardtop convertible, the SLs of today are powerful, technically advanced two-seaters with V-8 or V-12 engines. Yet they are to sports cars as the Vegas Elvis is to rock 'n' roll -- a flashy, bulging facsimile, as much about comfortable seats for patrons as about hip-shaking performance.

In other words, the SL is as establishment as it gets. If the message isn't clear, the big Mercedes star on the front drives it home like a silver-plated belt buckle. Then there's the price: $106,405 to start, rising to $123,445 for the SL550 that I tested. Entering its sixth generation, the 2013 SL is two inches longer and wider than the previous version. Yet even Mercedes has realized that the SL has raided the fridge too many times. Its new aluminum chassis and body -- the first mass-produced aluminum structure in Mercedes history -- trims 275 pounds compared with the departed model. That still leaves the SL550's claimed weight at just under two tons, about 600 pounds more than, say, a Corvette. Yet this new version actually feels more agile and less ponderous. Thank the aluminum diet, suspension trickery and the sort of overwhelming power once reserved for high-performance AMG editions. That aluminum structure is a science fair's worth of cast, extruded and sheet pieces; just 10 percent of the car's weight is conventional steel. The new twin-turbo 4.7-liter V-8 amasses 429 horsepower, up from 382 horses of the bigger, naturally aspirated 5.5-liter in the 2012 model. The bigger gain is in torque, which rises to an almost ridiculous 516 pound-feet, a 32 percent increase. (For full-bore ridiculousness, the SL63 AMG version makes up to 557 horsepower).

Lashed to a discreet-shifting 7-speed automatic transmission, even the base-model SL550 scampers to 60 miles per hour in barely four seconds, on virtual par with last year's SL63 AMG model. Like one of its main rivals, the BMW 6 Series, the Mercedes feels impervious. This SL's light but strong structure barely quivers over railroad tracks or potholes. Its steering is protected from unwanted intrusions like a hip-hop mogul surrounded by bodyguards. And like a nightclubbing star, the steering rack seems lubricated with a rare, expensive brand of liqueur. So yes, the SL550 drives as a six-figure, grand-touring convertible should: beautifully. It's too bad the beauty ends there. Sneak up from the side, as though the SL were a grazing thoroughbred, and this Benz still looks awfully good. The profile is low and lean, with classic long-hood, short-deck proportions. But to quote Cher Horowitz, the deceptively canny Valley Girl in ""Clueless,"" the SL is a full-on Monet: from far away, it looks all right; up close, it's a big old mess.

But regulators can't be blamed for the SL's disjointed appearance, especially a front and back that are the design equivalent of a blind date: these two strangers aren't about to get along -- especially if the rear end should ask, ""Does this composite deck make me look fat?"" The interior is much easier on the eyes, including the test car's sumptuous three-way of red and black leather with black-ash wooden trim. The seats are eye-popping and back-comforting. A stubby metal joystick of a shifter is new. A standard Harman Kardon sound system nestles enormous 7.9-inch subwoofers inside the footwells, using the enclosures to amplify the bass. Wind buffeting in the cabin is minimal. The Airscarf system, with headrest fans to warm your neck on chilly top-down days, is standard. The roof opens or closes in less than 20 seconds. Another $2,500 brings Magic Sky Control, which darkens the clear glass sunroof at the touch of a button. A stop-start system shuts down the engine, to save fuel, when the car is halted. The federal fuel economy rating is 24 m.p.g. on the highway and 16 in town. Electric power steering, a first on the SL, has a variable ratio, delivering faster response over the first few degrees of steering input. That makes for quicker turn-in when you first crank the wheel and for easier low-speed parking maneuvers. Adaptive cruise control with pre-collision braking, blind spot monitors and a lane-departure monitor are part of a $2,950 Driver Assistance Package. Given all the advanced engineering, it's amazing that some simple details slipped Mercedes's attention. For years, critics have complained that it's too easy to confuse the turn-signal stalk with the adjacent cruise-control lever.

This SL fails to remedy the situation. And now a third stalk is wedged onto the column to electrically tilt and telescope the wheel. The three stalks together create a kind of unholy Jenga arrangement. Some other longtime SL annoyances remain, including triangle-shaped rear side windows that you barely notice -- until you return to the parked car to find they've been open for hours, leaving your car vulnerable to thieves. That mistake happens, invariably, when you close the roof and forget to retoggle the window switch after the main glass rises. You'd think Mercedes would discover the wonders of a universal windows-up switch, like the one in Audi cabriolets. The cup holders are shallow and often powerless against rising G-forces. Hermetically sealed java is in order when a driver treads on the gas. The SL is explosively quick, and the optional Active Body Control ($4,090) pins it to the pavement. Yet both despite and because of electronic distractions, the SL still doesn't drive like a Porsche or other pure sports cars. The throttle can feel indecisive, granting too little or too much power, the latter upsetting the balance. The Benz feels supersonic over twisty roads, but can also feel as if it's not fully connected to the pavement. That's largely due to the active steering, which is quick but smothers road feel in pools of digital butter. None of this will surprise the doctors, athletes and entrepreneurs who choose the SL for what it is: a classic, comfortable roadster that confers instant status. For such buyers, the SL's irreproachable status has long been a key. I'd say ""more power to them,"" but the SL has that covered as well.","The 2013 Mercedes SL is powerful and technically advanced, yet it is to sports cars as the Vegas Elvis is to rock 'n' roll — a flashy, bulging facsimile, as much about comfortable seats as about hip-shaking performance.",7fe2a085-0aa0-5c9d-91f0-c5b71b3d5609,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/02/10/automobiles/10WHEE/10WHEE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=327&w=600&s=5bdca2a3b5335cc516e67c4cee5eb61c30dfb54e22ea0825c109bba902de85a8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"DIETING Now 275 pounds lighter, the new SL-Class has the first mass-produced aluminum structure on a Mercedes-Benz production car.",7fe2a085-0aa0-5c9d-91f0-c5b71b3d5609,N24News/imgs/7fe2a085-0aa0-5c9d-91f0-c5b71b3d5609.jpg,23
Health,"If You're Sick, Stay Away From Work. If You Can't, Here Is What Doctors Advise.",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/health/working-sick.html,"If You're Sick, Stay Away From Work. If You Can't, Here Is What Doctors Advise.

When Elle Fraser, a business operations assistant for the New Jersey Devils, came down with the flu just before Thanksgiving last year, she didn't think about staying home from work. The hockey team had home games on Wednesday and Friday that week, and she worried that her work would never get done without her, even if she had a 103-degree fever. She toughed it out, alternating between chills and sweats, falling asleep at her desk, wiping down every surface she touched, and insisting to co-workers she was wearing mittens to handle tickets only because she was cold. On that Wednesday, Ms. Fraser, 23, worked from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. On Thanksgiving Day, she slept most of the day. The next day, she went back to work, just as sick as she was on Wednesday.

Sure, she technically had a choice to use a sick day and stay home, but that was not how she saw it. She thought she didn't really have a choice. ""Nobody tries to convince you to go home because they knew in that situation they'd be doing the same thing,"" she said. Some people might read her account as a tribute to hard work and selflessness. Others might be aghast that she had risked exposing others to illness. It's clear on which side doctors come down: They say workers with the flu or a cold should use sick days far more often than they do. Though millions of Americans don't get paid time off when they're sick, those who do have the option often don't take it. ""If it's bad enough that you're wondering if you should stay home, you should probably stay home,"" said Dr. Pritish K. Tosh, an infectious diseases researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

When, and how long, should you stay home? Remember: It's not just about you. Even if you can battle the flu by enduring a miserable week, it can be deadly for others, especially pregnant women, young children and older people. And no matter how many precautions you take, there's no way to eliminate risk to people around you. As a general rule, Dr. Tosh suggested people stay home until they are fever-free for 24 hours. He said he stayed out of work for three or four days the last time he had the flu. ""People can be infectious even before they start to have symptoms, but most of the time that they're going to be most infectious is going to be when they are sickest, especially if they're having fevers,"" he said. Infectious germs are spread most frequently by airborne ""respiratory droplets"" from sneezing and coughing. The flu virus can last for up to 24 hours depending on the surface, Dr. Tosh said. By coughing or sneezing into your hands, or wiping a runny nose, your hands can spread the germs to everything you touch -- including surfaces many other people touch, such as door knobs, elevator buttons or shopping carts. ""You're never truly not contagious until all of those symptoms are resolved,"" said Dr. David Shih, executive vice president of strategy, health and innovation at CityMD, which runs a chain of urgent care centers in New Jersey, New York and Washington. How can you limit the exposure to others? Let's say you're ignoring the doctors and going out into the world anyway. You're not alone: A CityMD survey in August found that 69 percent of Americans with the flu or flulike symptoms said they went to the drugstore or a pharmacy, 43 percent said they went to the grocery store and 39 percent said they went to work. Millennials (76 percent) were far more likely than those 35 or older (56 percent) to have left the house the last time they were sick.

Though you can't eliminate the risk of infecting others, there are steps you can take to minimize it:
* Get in the habit of coughing and sneezing into your elbow, not your hand. Children are being taught to cough like Dracula.
* Limit your interaction with other people as much as possible. If you're going to work, consider skipping nonessential meetings.
* Avoid physical contact with other people, especially shaking hands.
* Wipe surfaces down after touching them.
* Use hand sanitizer or wash your hands after coughing or sneezing.
* Take medication to reduce your symptoms. Oh, by the way, get your flu shot. What about people who don't have sick days? Stay-at-home parents scoff at the idea of sick days, as do millions of other workers whose jobs don't offer paid time off. ""For people who are living paycheck to paycheck or have significant debt, the risks of staying home and losing pay or potentially losing their job are far too great,"" said Vicki Shabo, vice president for workplace policies and strategies at the National Partnership for Women and Families. Low-income earners and part-time workers are especially likely to work while sick, including those at restaurants and hospitals. Ms. Shabo and advocates like her are pushing for laws mandating paid sick days, which are in place or will be soon in eight states, 30 cities and two counties. ""It's important from a public health perspective, and a workplace morale perspective, that people can take the time they need to recover,"" she said.","Those who have paid sick time should use it but often don't, despite doctors' warnings that it risks infecting other people.",6c0b8c30-4e9f-568c-8e30-d1a9500b7d7b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/27/us/14xp-sick/00xp-sick-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a33b0e2116031c4a3c77650c95f1fa8129094d834f24d889194a90f7a65b7a25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Prof. Marshall W.

Real Estate,"Character Counts, Bathtub Essential",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/05/realestate/the-hunt-character-counts-bathtub-essential.html,"THREE years ago, after graduating from Georgetown University and working in politics, Kimmie Lipscomb moved to New York for a job. Back then the rental market was soft. Using a broker, she landed an alcove studio on Bank Street in the West Village. It cost $2,200 a month, with a broker fee of one month's rent. Ms. Lipscomb had her own washer-dryer, ""which is too good to be true,"" she said. She had a working fireplace, too. ""It was by the foot of my bed,"" she said. ""It couldn't have been more charming.""

In Philadelphia, Ms. Lipscomb spent $1,350 a month to rent a one-bedroom in a brick row house near Rittenhouse Square, a neighborhood she sometimes called ""West Village Lite."" After she finished her studies in the spring, she lined up a job in New York and began the hunt for a one-bedroom or an alcove studio. She was assisted by Morgan Turkewitz, an agent at Citi Habitats, which had an arrangement with her employer. From Philadelphia, Ms. Lipscomb said, ""I proceeded to drive Morgan crazy for several weeks"" by bombarding her with online listings for nice-looking apartments. Every day, it seemed, she had a new online apartment crush. Her price range was up to $2,500 a month. Her first thought was to rent in her old Bank Street building. But alcove studios there were now more than $2,800. ""She liked living there, but not that much,"" Ms. Turkewitz said.

Ms. Lipscomb, 29, who is from Auburn, Ala., entertains often. She hoped to find an open kitchen so she could talk to friends while cooking. ""I hate saying this, but I am a homebody,"" Ms. Lipscomb said. ""I am not one of those people who say I am never in my apartment. I love having people over, even in a small space, so it was critical to me that I got a place I liked."" She wanted a bathtub, too. In a city with many shower-only bathrooms, ""you have to specify that a tub is something you are looking for,"" she said. And she didn't want just any tub, she wanted a tub with a shower curtain. ""It's weird to take a bath when you are behind a shower door,"" she said. ""I think it is grimy. I don't want to have to squeegee it."" Though Ms. Lipscomb was interested in returning to the West Village, she was also willing to consider the Upper West Side, though ""some days more than others,"" she said. Good friends, a married couple, lived in the West 70s near Central Park. When she came to New York to look at apartments, she stayed with them. One night, after dinner in the West Village, they walked along gritty 14th Street to the subway. They emerged at Central Park West, lined with trees and lighted by street lamps. Her friends pointed out the contrast, asking her, ""Isn't this what you want to come home to?"" she said.

One of her apartment crushes was on a place in the West 80s, a studio for only $1,785 a month. It looked large and beautiful in the photos. In real life, however, the apartment was a small room with a sink ""the size of a cereal bowl,"" Ms. Lipscomb said. The rickety elevator made her uncharacteristically nervous. ""Kimmie was pretty proactive,"" Ms. Turkewitz said. ""She had the crush of the day. She would send me listings that looked nice online, but pictures can make them look a lot better than they are in person."" On West 85th Street, a one-bedroom was listed for $2,600, with the possibility of negotiation. It had a pretty garden view and even a working fireplace. But it wasn't quite as nice inside as the next one, a sunny alcove studio in the West 70s with two large closets and a cute arched doorway. The bathroom was big, with a window. One wall of the living room served as the kitchen, dishwasher included. Ms. Lipscomb liked it, but she hesitated. ""I told Morgan, I am going to need to see enough places to know,"" she said. Back in the West Village, a studio in a walk-up building on Charles Street looked good. ""If that apartment had been 50 percent bigger, I would have gone with that,"" Ms. Lipscomb said. Another studio had a layout so restrictive that the bed would have to be placed in the middle of the room or in the kitchen.

West Village apartments in her price range tended to be too small and unrenovated. ""They have character,"" Ms. Turkewitz said, ""but you are paying to have somewhere to go home, hang up your coat and go to sleep."" Ms. Lipscomb wanted a place to settle into, not a place to crash. She realized that nothing she had seen compared with the alcove studio in the West 70s, just one block from her friends. She went back and signed a two-year lease for $2,400 a month, with a broker fee of 13.5 percent of a year's rent, or nearly $4,000. She likes the simplicity of a relatively small building with no doorman. ""Just to get out of an apartment building can take a couple of minutes sometimes, waiting for the elevator,"" she said. In a building like hers, where she often takes the stairs, ""it's not like you're going to get caught in small talk."" Her job, in currency sales, starts Monday. She must be at work at 6 a.m., so every minute counts. She is contemplating the purchase of a programmable coffee maker. She got the bathtub she wanted, brightened with a yellow shower curtain and with more character than the average tub. The drain is a ""little contraption that sticks up out of the floor and I kind of love it,"" Ms. Lipscomb said. ""When am I going to have that again?"" She is less enamored of the kitchen layout; the refrigerator door doesn't fully open -- it hits a wall. Only now that she lives so close to good friends does she realize the value of such proximity. She gets to see them more than she expected. The closeness ""is going to add a lot of joy to my life,"" she said.","Kimmie Lipscomb wanted a one-bedroom or a studio for $2,500 a month.

Style,1stdibs Inches Closer to the One Percent,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/11/style/1st-dibs.html,"Early this week, the bricks-and-mortar version of 1stdibs, the high-end online marketplace, will open in the Terminal Stores building: the blocklong, late-19th-century brick warehouse and relay station that was once home to the Tunnel, the grim nightclub owned by Peter Gatien. The 50-odd exhibitors corralled there -- a mix of art, antiques and contemporary furniture dealers -- join neighbors Uber and L'Oreal; on the building's cavernous main floor, where ravers once hallucinated, is Porchlight, a Danny Meyer restaurant, one of a few in what will become a food court along the lines of Eataly or Chelsea Market.

The move comes as 1stdibs continues to expand as a global e-commerce site, a process that has not always been smooth for the dealers that are its lifeblood. Nearly three years ago, they were affronted by changes that added commissions to sales generated through the site and also veiled their names. ""We lost 2 percent of our dealers when we changed our policy,"" said David Rosenblatt, the company's C.E.O. ""But since we introduced e-commerce, we've grown our inventory from 440,000 items to 860,000."" Some dealers still grumble privately. Others who once balked say they are eager to continue a relationship with the company.

""We didn't end up raising prices,"" said Kiel Wuellner, president of Newel Gallery, in business since 1939, and with a capacious booth in the Terminal Stores building and 7,000 pieces on the site. ""What happened is that we are no longer able to pass along our standard trade or discount pricing. But the reason we have invested in 1stdibs is the amount of business it brings us. We're the largest antiques shop in New York City for the past 80 years, and this makes us global."" There are now 4,000 dealers from 28 countries (more than half of which are outside the United States) on 1stdibs, according to the company; last year, e-commerce sales reached over $250 million, up from zero in 2016.

In the Aero booth, a powder-coated dark green aluminum outdoor chair by Thomas O'Brien with a whorled back is $1050. The polyethylene version of Faye Toogood's plump Roly Poly chair, priced at $570 and already a best-seller on the 1stdibs website, is a bargain when you consider its bronze incarnation costs $45,000. Among a funky, still-anarchic-looking collection of '70s-era Italian Radical design by Gufram are contemporary productions of that impish work: anthropomorphic green foam coat racks by Guido Drocco and Franco Mello start at about $4,600; Bocca, the disco-glam lip-shaped sofa by Studio 65, is about $7,500. A slightly grubby, but comfy looking, brown corduroy Danish modern sofa in Nate Berkus's booth is $4,400. At Assouline, which has a booth here too, you can find Miles Redd's ""The Big Book of Chic"" for $85. Last Wednesday, Inga Davidsson of Area ID was hanging an Italian chandelier of florid amber-colored glass ribbons and curlicues tipped in red, Venetian style ($4,950) in her 315-square-foot booth: a north facing spot with a window, prime real estate that she is renting for $3,200 a month. Ms. Davidsson sells an eclectic selection of midcentury furniture artfully styled, like a bergere from the '50s now covered in a bold Miro-like fabric ($2,950) along with contemporary shagreen pieces.

""I hear there is a men's bag store there now,"" Ms. Davidsson said of her old place. ""I wish them luck."" As for the former 1stdibs space at 200 Lexington, you'll still find more than 50 dealers who've signed on with Incollect, the 4-and-a-half-year-old 1stdibs competitor. Others have opened their own showrooms in the building. The beloved antiques store Lost City Arts, which will give up its lease on Cooper Square in March, will have a 4,500 square feet showroom there. It also has a booth at the 1stdibs Gallery.",A move from the New York Design Center to the fancy mall in the old Tunnel nightclub.,012dd731-07f5-530d-a7df-5e0b68321f82,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/14/fashion/14FIRSTDIBS-1/14FIRSTDIBS-1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=06d147db889754bb17f9546f7c86468950640b662958cb65bf4c03b97711d81e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Nineteenth-century French wares at 145 Antiques, one of more than 50 dealers in the new 1stdibs Gallery.",012dd731-07f5-530d-a7df-5e0b68321f82,N24News/imgs/012dd731-07f5-530d-a7df-5e0b68321f82.jpg,15
Fashion & Style,"For Indie Designers, Uniting Is a Survival Skill",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/11/fashion/retail-coop-flying-solo-new-york-fashion-week.html,"For an independent designer operating in a world of megabrands like Amazon, Zara, Nike and H&M, an old maxim may hold the key to survival: United we are stronger. At least that was the thinking Elizabeth Solomeina applied when she was struggling to find a way to show and sell the jewelry she designs without spending huge amounts of money on rent or outsourcing her work to various boutiques. ""I needed a place to sell my stuff, I needed a customer base,"" Ms. Solomeina said. ""When stylists wanted to come over to my studio, I would tell them it's in Brooklyn, and they would be like, 'Never mind.'""

""I wasn't alone,"" she said. ""I had friends like this, too."" So in the summer of 2016, she gathered 34 of them and together they pitched in funds to open a boutique called Flying Solo on Mulberry Street in NoLIta. Within three months, the group had expanded to 45 designers. In June of this year, it grew again, adding more than 20 to the roster and moving to a two-floor shop on West Broadway, on the same block as Missoni, Aesop and DKNY.

Last Friday, during New York Fashion Week, the group of 68 held a two-hour-long presentation and runway show in the store, displaying more than 350 looks. During the presentation, models in neutral colors showed off jewelry and accessories, rotating every few minutes. The runway show included a variety of aesthetic visions. Most of the pieces were the kind you could walk out onto the street wearing, and all were available immediately after the show.

As techno beats and songs by Little Dragon, Migos and Sango pounded through the speakers, models strutted by in metallic and brightly colored pants and jackets (from Daniel Silverstain, who has designed for Solange and Lady Gaga); long coats with ""Proud Immigrant"" written across the back (from Ricardo Seco, a Mexican designer); tweed suits and knit dresses (from Kathrin Henon, who works with Dennis Basso); and much more.

Between each section of the show, models in silver pants and Flying Solo T-shirts created by the designers walked by with signs denoting the next designer's Instagram handle. Flying Solo operates somewhat like a grocery or building co-op, with members paying a membership fee that goes toward rent, production and marketing costs for events like the fashion week show. Each member is required to work eight hours every week, opening and closing the store, cleaning and helping customers on the floor. When the team members opened their first store on Mulberry Street, they put together as much of the interior themselves as they could. ""We designed the racks, the shelving,"" Ms. Solomeina said. ""Our designers were sketching, running to Home Depot, assembling racks."" They were ready for customers in three days. On West Broadway, it took all of four. ""It's our sweat and I hope no tears,"" Ms. Solomeina said. Flying Solo has had help from outside. Early on, Ms. Solomeina secured funding from Alex Barnett, an investor who has worked with technology companies and charities. Mr. Barnett saw in Ms. Solomeina's proposal a model for the future. ""A lot of them are really brilliant designers,"" he said of Flying Solo's members. ""It's a tragedy that the brilliance isn't rewarded. A lot of times it's who has a lot of capital or who gets picked up by a big brand or whatever the trend is at that moment."" Speaking of the changes in the retail landscape that have been spurred by the advent of technology and the expansion of giants like Amazon, Zara and H&M, Mr. Barnett said: ""I don't think change should be feared. It's creating space for innovation. Independent designers need to stop working against each other and realize they're all on the same side.""",Several dozen designers have pooled their resources to market their wares in a boutique in SoHo.,8309a11f-f5a8-5f57-b9f2-8696fd6e5720,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/fashion/11FLYINGSOLO/11FLYINGSOLO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2bc66248ec549c82ca40b4bd5b99cc0a17c4827407f158360b5dcce739e4028d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Flying Solo, a fashion co-op in SoHo, new looks from Daniel Silverstain.",8309a11f-f5a8-5f57-b9f2-8696fd6e5720,N24News/imgs/8309a11f-f5a8-5f57-b9f2-8696fd6e5720.jpg,19
Sports,How Virginia Has Coped With a One-of-a-Kind Loss,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/22/sports/virginia-cavaliers-upset.html,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- There are two ways, said the sports psychologist Michael Gervais, for a team to respond to the stress that comes when thoughts of a particularly painful defeat are dredged up. One is to think about situations in which the dreadful memory will re-emerge and face it down, talk about it, plan how to respond. The other is to move on. Period. ""For some people,"" Gervais said, the latter option ""is the correct choice."" ""For most of us,"" he added, ""that seems fine until we get close to the environment that feels or smells or looks like the first environment."" At which point, he said, it becomes apparent that things should have been thought through a little more.

The Virginia men's basketball team is approaching such a situation. In the first round of the N.C.A.A. tournament last year, the Cavaliers had a meteor land on them. They became the only No. 1 men's seed ever to lose to a No. 16, falling to the Retrievers of the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, by 20 points. Now, here they go again: Top-seeded Virginia will meet the No. 16 Gardner-Webb Runnin' Bulldogs (more frisky canines) on Friday in Columbia, S.C.

Last year's loss initially devastated Virginia's players. Kyle Guy, a guard who is now a junior, wrote a moving Facebook post in which he described walking around campus knowing that everyone knew why he was wearing a hoodie and sunglasses. ""There aren't many people who know what it's like to be the ONLY person (program in this instance) in the world to be on the wrong side of history,"" he wrote. But six months after that, in Charlotte, N.C., for a media day, Guy was singing a different tune -- in the same building, no less, where the awful upset had occurred. ""For me, it's never forgetting it,"" he said, ""but definitely trying to move past it to where I'm not hanging my head.""

This month, in Charlotte again for the Atlantic Coast Conference Tournament, Coach Tony Bennett seemed to reject inquiries about Last Year. ""We've grown from that experience,"" he told reporters. ""We've owned it. We've talked about it. We had a great year last year and a hard loss. But it's time to press on, and there's not any more to say about that."" Through a spokesman, Bennett declined a request to discuss last year's tournament loss in an interview. In other words, Virginia appears to have chosen Gervais's Option B. Fans aren't quite there, at least not those interviewed before and during the Cavaliers' final regular season game, a win over Louisville. They had not quite moved on. ""I want people to stop talking about losing to a 16th seed,"" said Nicole Vaughan, a fan waiting to watch the game at a sports bar that had been converted from a train station not far from the university's John Paul Jones Arena.

The greatest Cavalier ever, Ralph Sampson, was a three-time college player of the year and a No. 1 overall N.B.A. draft pick who took Virginia to a Final Four but never won a conference tournament. His teams were stymied by the great Tar Heels squads of Michael Jordan and James Worthy, and by North Carolina State's miracle national champions of 1983. As the Cavaliers have won or shared four regular-season A.C.C. titles during the last several years under Bennett, there has been a string of N.C.A.A. tournament disappointments. Last year's loss was the third time Virginia had been defeated as a No. 1 seed. ""Part of their depression, for lack of a better word,"" Jerry Ratcliffe, a longtime local sports journalist, said, referring to the fans, ""went back to when they lost to a really good Michigan State team in Madison Square Garden a few years ago, and they felt like that team was Final Four material. And the collapse against Syracuse a couple years ago -- that definitely was a Final Four team."" Then, too, there was the style of last year's defeat. Virginia found itself trailing early in the second half, and Bennett's team, famous for a careful, slow style of play that critics say makes it susceptible to upsets, failed to erase the deficit. ""Now you have to hear it forever,"" said Tyler Pearson, another patron at the restaurant to watch the regular season finale. ""Everything they said is true: The system doesn't work; if you fall behind, you can't come back; Tony is stubborn."" This year's Cavaliers are almost certainly better than the team that lost to U.M.B.C. They had just two regular-season losses, both to Duke, the tournament's top overall seed. They retained most of their leading players from last season while adding Braxton Key, a transfer from Alabama, and the freshman Kihei Clark. De'Andre Hunter, a sophomore who did not play in the U.M.B.C. game because of a broken wrist, might be this season's national player of the year if Duke's Zion Williamson did not exist. And he is healthy.","As a No. 1 seed last year, the Cavaliers lost to No. 16 Maryland, Baltimore County. Now they must deal with a similar matchup this year.",8fe48238-1678-5998-b912-fa17866c03bc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/22/sports/22-ncaa-virginia-01-PRINT/merlin_151879779_31880fa7-4cb3-4dc4-81dc-c125466186ef-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=3868685f2284c6c2a73f3b65b156d9e88cec5075fab7a5720c5174b07e14ef09&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At Virginia, there is hope that lightning will not strike twice.",8fe48238-1678-5998-b912-fa17866c03bc,N24News/imgs/8fe48238-1678-5998-b912-fa17866c03bc.jpg,9
Automobiles,2014 Paris Motor Show: Mercedes Offers Something for Everyone,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/04/automobiles/2014-paris-motor-show-mercedes-offers-something-for-everyone.html,"PARIS -- Mercedes-Benz brought a smorgasbord of new vehicles to the 2014 Paris Motor Show and spent a lot of time explaining how its polarizing new range of small A-, B-, CLA- And GLA-Class vehicles have become sales successes. But all the visual sizzle was supplied by its biggest, most powerful and costliest models.

It was the auto show debut for the new S 500 plug-in hybrid, which features a gasoline-electric powertrain that offers up to 333 horsepower and has an electric-only range of about 20 miles. The company promised that by 2017 it would introduce nine more Mercedes models that use the technology.

Though some of the models ""unveiled"" here have been seen previously at non-auto-show events, this was the first showing of the new Mercedes-AMG C63, the range topper of the C-Class lineup.

""With the new Mercedes-AMG C63, our performance experts demonstrate once again that characteristics like 'family friendly' and 'racetrack ready' need not be contradictory,"" Dieter Zetsche, chief executive of Mercedes's parent company, Daimler, said in introducing the car on Thursday.","Big sedans and powerful AMG performance cars made the biggest splash, but Mercedes was persistent in its presence across all segments.",28124012-8912-5820-8835-ff6947c4e180,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/04/automobiles/04mercedes-sub/04mercedes-sub-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=383&w=600&s=06396bfcc445559c42d1503844a93abaf477204bd9dd73cce1deac478a3476ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Dieter Zetsche, chairman of Daimler, introduced the Mercedes-AMG GT, left, and C 63 Thursday at the Paris Motor Show.",28124012-8912-5820-8835-ff6947c4e180,N24News/imgs/28124012-8912-5820-8835-ff6947c4e180.jpg,23

Health,"Dr. John Hansen, Who Made Marrow Transplants Safer, Dies at 76",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/13/health/dr-john-hansen-dead.html,"Dr. John A. Hansen, an immunologist whose pioneering research made bone marrow transplants safer and vastly expanded the pool of potential donors to patients with leukemia and other blood disorders, died on July 31 at his home in Mercer Island, Wash. He was 76. The cause was pancreatic cancer, his wife, Suzanne Hansen, said. As a clinical researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle from 1977 until he retired last year, Dr. Hansen had a profound impact on the treatment of leukemia, lymphoma and blood and immune system diseases. His team in Seattle developed sophisticated methods of determining which combination of chemicals in a patient's immune system is required to keep his body from rejecting a marrow transplant from a donor -- either a sibling or a complete stranger -- whose tissue type does not precisely match. With Drs. Jeffrey McCullough in Minnesota and Herbert Perkins in San Francisco, Dr. Hansen also helped establish a national registry called bethematch.org, which links patients awaiting transplants with potential donors of bone marrow, blood stem cells and a newborn's umbilical cord blood.

The registry, operated by the National Marrow Donor Program and authorized by the federal government in 1986, was conceived by a Colorado couple, Dr. Robert Graves and his wife, Sherry. In 1979, their 10-year-old daughter, Laura, was found to have leukemia. Through Hutchinson she received what was described as the first bone marrow transplant from an unrelated donor for leukemia. The transplant was deemed a success, but her cancer recurred, and she died two years later. The program says it maintains links to more than 30 million potential donors worldwide. ""The contributions that John made in the field of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were extraordinary,"" Dr. Gary Gilliland, the president and director of the Hutchinson center, said in a statement. ""Measured in the number of human lives saved, few physician-scientists have had the impact that he had during his lifetime and will continue to have."" Dr. Hansen planned to specialize in cardiac surgery after medical school. But he discovered that the nascent field of heart transplantation was being hampered by the tendency of patients' immune systems to reject the organs.

At Hutchinson, Dr. Hansen headed the transplant program's clinical tissue-typing laboratory; held the titles of senior vice president and director of the Clinical Research Division; ran the Human Immunogenetics Program; and was medical director of the clinical immunogenetics laboratory at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. A genetic defect or a disease like leukemia can prevent the marrow -- the vascular tissue in the cavities of bones -- from producing the right combination of blood cells. In a bone-marrow transplant, a patient's diseased blood and immune system are replaced with healthy ones from a donor. To keep the body from rejecting the transplanted marrow, or vice versa, doctors seek to match the marrow type of the donor with that of the recipient as closely as possible. Family members are usually sought, but finding them has become more difficult as couples have fewer children. Rejection is determined largely by chemicals in the immune system called H.L.A. (human leukocyte group A) antigens, which enable the body to distinguish its own cells from others'. Dr. Hansen and his team advanced the screening techniques, which were perfected later at other institutions, to expand the universe of acceptable donors. He was part of the team that pioneered bone marrow transplantation, an achievement for which its leader, Dr. E. Donnall Thomas of Hutchinson, shared a Nobel Prize in 1990. About 1.3 million transplants of blood-forming stem cells or bone marrow have been performed worldwide since 1990.",His research expanded the pool of donors whose bone marrow was less likely to be rejected by patients with leukemia and other blood disorders.,1a9f3168-a575-5267-b1e9-680cfc44c782,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/14/obituaries/13Hansen1/13Hansen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b4cf6eca85991e88a743ba926ab67d24a7a2a07c1ab6ed632f37984e8d63d2b3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. John A.

Theater,No Waiting to Play This 'Godot',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/09/theater/aaron-monaghan-waiting-for-godot-druid.html,"""His physicality is obviously at the essence of his talent,"" the director of ""Waiting for Godot"" says of Aaron Monaghan, who portrays Gogo.

As a young actor coming up in the Irish theater, Aaron Monaghan was wary of the weight of tradition -- the way that classic plays can have the life strangled out of them by preconceptions about how they ought to be performed, and what they mean. That's why, for years, he deliberately didn't read Samuel Beckett's most famous play, ""Waiting for Godot."" He never saw it either, an avoidance unimpeded by his training at the Samuel Beckett Center at Trinity College, Dublin. ""The great irony of studying at the Beckett Center,"" Mr. Monaghan, who is 38, said one rainy afternoon this week, navigating the crowds at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, ""was that for the three long, intense, wonderful years that I trained there, an incredibly formative time, we never once looked at a Beckett play. Never once."" Sure that he would end up in ""Godot"" at 50 or 60 if he had a career, he wanted to come to it fresh. There are Shakespeare plays he still hasn't read for a similar reason. Beckett's ""Krapp's Last Tape,"" too.

But ""Godot"" is in his bones now. In the acclaimed Druid company production, running at Lincoln Center's White Light Festival through Nov. 13, he plays Estragon -- though he thinks of the character by his nickname, Gogo. Perched on a rock onstage before the performance begins, amid the hubbub of the audience settling in, he sometimes sings that nickname to himself. ""It just feels like a bit of a lullaby,"" Mr. Monaghan said, heading toward the modern paintings. Gallery-going is a favorite pastime when he is on tour, and a Picasso of an acrobat quickly caught his eye. ""I'm liking this guy,"" he said, then saw that it was called ""The Actor"" and laughingly took his statement back.

[Read our review of ""Waiting for Godot.""] ""His physicality is obviously at the essence of his talent,"" the show's Tony Award-winning director, Garry Hynes, said of Mr. Monaghan by phone. ""It's part of who he is -- almost a kind of dancer's mobility."" Paired with Marty Rea's long, tall Vladimir (a.k.a. Didi), Mr. Monaghan is costumed to look short and stocky. Offstage he's trim and bespectacled, a gentle, good-humored presence with a rigorous approach to acting. ""If you're not working, you're preparing for the next job,"" he said. ""Get into the gym, keep fit, go to galleries, read plays, write: It's all work."" By writing, he explained as he reached into his satchel for a bound notebook, he meant the journals he keeps for each play: pages filled with neat rows of his minuscule script and occasional sketches, recording the progress of the show, discoveries he's made, how he feels. One thing he's feeling lately is ready for a break. When the Lincoln Center run wraps up, he will have worked 52 weeks back to back -- an ""absolutely joyous"" time, he said, but also relentless. He's eager, once he's home in Dublin, where he lives with his wife of nearly two years, to get a proper haircut and neaten up -- maybe even shave off -- the scruffy beard he's had to leave untouched to portray a Beckett tramp. Not that he doesn't love Didi and Gogo. ""I think they're just adorable creatures,"" he said. An Obie Award winner for playing Cripple Billy in Ms. Hynes's production of Martin McDonagh's ""The Cripple of Inishmaan"" at Atlantic Theater Company in 2008, Mr. Monaghan has worked with her since 2005, when she spotted him onstage and envisioned him playing the title role in ""The Playboy of the Western World."" After a casual audition that he spent feeling embarrassed, certain he was doing badly, she cast him.

""Godot"" is a play that Ms. Hynes, Druid's artistic director, felt no need to revive when Mr. Monaghan, Mr. Rea and two other company members -- Rory Nolan, who plays Pozzo, and Garrett Lombard, who plays Lucky -- asked her if they could do it. For over a year, she said, she resisted the idea. The actors themselves, Mr. Monaghan said, thought they were decades too young for the roles. The characters are usually played by older men, though that's dictated by tradition, not Beckett's text. But they were looking for a four-hander to do together, and after Ms. Hynes scheduled it for a short run in Galway in 2016, it became an unexpected hit. In retrospect, Mr. Monaghan attributes some of the production's energy to the fact that he, anyway, didn't yet understand ""Godot."" ""I didn't know how the play operated,"" he said. ""I didn't know what it was about. And within that, as an actor, you panic. I'm not making excuses, but you maybe overcompensate with physicality or comedy or timing or rhythm or volume or color."" All of which, he added, is now played with a lighter hand. At the museum, with Gogo on his mind, he stood before van Gogh's ""Shoes."" In Beckett's blasted landscape, Gogo has boots that don't fit and fetid feet that hurt. When he manages to extract them from their boots, they're painfully red. In this existentialist tragicomedy, footwear is one of Gogo's major concerns. ""It's funny,"" Mr. Monaghan said, sizing up the painting. ""I saw it out of the corner of my head, and I went, 'Shoes, boots, cool.' But my thought was, 'They're not the right boots.'""","The highly physical Irish actor Aaron Monaghan came late to Beckett, and is young to portray Estragon. But the role fits (even if the shoes don't).",751e2b70-394b-5283-b6bc-e58c5065646b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/10/arts/09MONAGHAN1/09MONAGHAN1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=e351e38965bc6ee6a8c85a5e4c2b3556b75a2ceccf1da6e951ce4fab33c66514&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;His physicality is obviously at the essence of his talent,&rdquo; the director of &ldquo;Waiting for Godot&rdquo; says of Aaron Monaghan, who portrays Gogo.",751e2b70-394b-5283-b6bc-e58c5065646b,N24News/imgs/751e2b70-394b-5283-b6bc-e58c5065646b.jpg,10
Television,Trump's Low Approval Ratings Don't Surprise Seth Meyers,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/arts/television/late-night-trump-low-approval-rating.html,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We're all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.

Least Likely to Succeed

President Trump is focusing on reopening the country's economy even as health officials warn that the coronavirus is far from controlled. In the last week, 25 million more Americans left their home than in the six previous weeks, while the death toll continues to climb.

Seth Meyers noted on Wednesday's ""Late Night"" that the president's approval rating remained low, citing a recent poll finding that a majority of Americans support stay-at-home orders and distrust the Trump administration's handling of the country during the pandemic.

""Wow, that is shocking. I mean, how could you not trust the guy who said heat would kill the coronavirus, that cases would go down to zero, that it will go away in April, that a vaccine would come out soon, that hydroxychloroquine could be a gift from heaven, and that it could be cured by eating Lysol wipes out of a salad bowl with a fork and a knife?"" -- SETH MEYERS","Meyers joked that a majority of Americans somehow couldn't bring themselves to trust a guy who believes Covid-19 ""could be cured by eating Lysol wipes out of a salad bowl with a fork and a knife.""",36dcdd74-a7b7-51c4-844a-6b7d23183b17,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/14/arts/14latenight/14latenight-facebookJumbo.png?year=2020&h=473&w=903&s=46895f51331b5bc89e713754ab64c3fe2b75dab7d473b9fcf5ba1a9c51ae5f6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Meyers joked a majority of Americans somehow couldn't bring themselves to trust a guy who believes Covid-19 ""could be cured by eating Lysol wipes out of a salad bowl with a fork and a knife.""",36dcdd74-a7b7-51c4-844a-6b7d23183b17,N24News/imgs/36dcdd74-a7b7-51c4-844a-6b7d23183b17.jpg,3
Health,"In Some Countries, Women Get Days Off for Period Pain",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/24/health/period-pain-paid-time-off-policy.html,"In Some Countries, Women Get Days Off for Period Pain

Recently Akanksha Seda got in her car at 10:30 a.m., as usual, and rode 45 minutes to her company's office in Mumbai, India. A few hours later, she got her period and, she recalled, ""the eighteen-wheeler truckload of cramps."" Rather than popping painkillers and working through it, as she used to, Ms. Seda went to her supervisor and informed him she was taking the day off. For many Indian women, that would be considered a bold move. Periods are a taboo subject, and discussing cramps with a man can be embarrassing for some, Ms. Seda said. But at Culture Machine, the digital media company where she works, she was entitled to the day off. This month, the company put in place a ""menstrual leave policy,"" allowing women to take a paid day off during their period without dipping into sick days or vacation time.

It is one of a handful of private Indian companies to have started such policies in recent months. Menstrual leaves are recognized in few other countries, among them Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, South Korea and Zambia. The move has set off fierce debate, not just in India but around the world. Experts say the spread of such policies -- despite their best intentions -- could actually deter women's progress in the workplace. The additional days off could be used to justify lower pay or increase hiring bias against women, critics say. Absences could push women out of decision-making roles and eliminate them from consideration for promotions. And these policies may play into a decades-old prejudice that menstruation makes women unfit for work. ""It suggests women are uniquely handicapped in the workplace by the fact that they have periods,"" said Emily Martin, vice president for workplace justice at the National Women's Law Center.

A 2012 study found that 20 percent of women experience periods painful enough to interfere with daily activities. While it is important to acknowledge their experiences, Ms. Martin said, a menstrual leave policy does more than that: It brands every woman who menstruates as ill. It would be better, she said, to develop an overall leave policy for men and women to take time off for a host of reasons, including chronic medical conditions. Periods have long served as an excuse to keep girls out of school and women out of the work force, said Sharra L. Vostral, associate professor of history at Purdue and author of ""Under Wraps: A History of Menstrual Hygiene Technology."" Female air service pilots during World War II were often barred from flying if they had cramps, she said. Carla Pascoe, a research fellow at the University of Melbourne in Australia, said some women were told not to use sewing machines or read novels during their periods because they might overexert themselves. ""It's because of this history that I'm wary of returning to an argument that all females are crippled by menstruation -- which is what menstrual leave implies to me,"" she said. Women with severe period pain should be given time off, she added, but it does not need to be a blanket policy. Devleena Majumder, president of human resources at Culture Machine, said such arguments overlook the unique challenges women face.

""We are biologically different, and we need to acknowledge that,"" she said. That is why maternity leave is offered more commonly than paternity leave, she added. But there's an important difference, said Pauline Maki, research director for the Center for Research on Women and Gender at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Having a child affects all women's ability to work, while periods are debilitating only for some. ""Family leave policies are based on experiences that are much more universal,"" she said. Japan has offered menstrual leave policies since 1947, when a law was passed allowing any woman with painful periods, or whose job might exacerbate period pain, to take time off. A 1986 study of the policy found that the number of women using it declined from 20 percent in 1960 to 13 percent in 1981, largely because of societal pressures that frown upon its use. South Korea granted women menstrual leave in 2001, though the policy has since come under fire from men who see it as a form of reverse discrimination. And in Indonesia, women are entitled to two days off a month for period pain, but the policy is poorly enforced. The Italian Parliament will soon vote on a bill introduced in March that would require companies to offer three paid days off to women with severe menstrual cramps. Here, too, some worry it will hurt women more than help. To Ms. Seda at Culture Machine, the debate seems ridiculous. ""If the world had no men, if there were only women working, nobody would have been up in arms about a 'first day of period' leave,"" she said.","In some countries, companies offer women paid time off for period pain. But some experts fear these policies reinforce dated stereotypes.",bf2d7e81-51e4-5d0e-8f8e-7f5c0a62ce0b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/25/science/25GLOBAL1/25GLOBAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=f222a2fd4d1e33a311739075bea38eb81cfd339aa4ad64f5e2e959ee3a3eb0af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Woman in the subway in Mumbai, India.",bf2d7e81-51e4-5d0e-8f8e-7f5c0a62ce0b,N24News/imgs/bf2d7e81-51e4-5d0e-8f8e-7f5c0a62ce0b.jpg,1
Art & Design,The Artist Beneath the Art Forger,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/arts/design/elmyr-de-hory-art-forgery.html,"Mark Forgy, the caretaker of the art forger Elmyr de Hory's legacy, between two authentic portraits by de Hory now on view at the Hillstrom Museum of Art: left, his ""Self-Portrait,"" circa 1973; right, ""Portrait of Mark Forgy,"" 1972.





ST. PETER, Minn. -- Mark Forgy's home on the outskirts of Minneapolis looks like a museum. Works of art hang floor-to-ceiling. They hang in stairwells, in closets and behind doors. In the living room, a bronze bust of the artist who made all these pieces smirks slightly from the corner, admiring his work: a Matisse, a Modigliani, a handful of Picassos. Mr. Forgy owns the largest collection of work by Elmyr de Hory, one of the most notorious art forgers of the 20th century. In the 1950s and '60s, de Hory is believed to have forged over a thousand works by major artists. Many have been removed from museums. Others, some experts say, have not. Mr. Forgy has spent years dedicated to the memory of de Hory. He has written a book, gives talks and contributes to exhibitions on forgery. It is his calling, he says, and has all led to his newest endeavor: putting on an exhibition of de Hory's original work. No forgeries. Just de Hory in his own voice.

""It's work trying to be no one other than himself,"" said Mr. Forgy. ""There's no pretense."" The exhibition, at the Hillstrom Museum of Art in St. Peter, Minn., focuses on de Hory's portraiture. Now, more than four decades after the painter's death, viewers can ""leave behind the sensational tabloid-worthiness of his story,"" Mr. Forgy said. It is the first glimpse at the artist underneath the forger.

Throughout his life de Hory struggled to inspire interest in his own work. A Hungarian artist, he came to the United States in August 1947, and by January 1948 he exhibited some work at Lilienfeld Galleries in New York. ARTNews described it as striking ""the well-known chord of the School of Paris."" In a city exploding with the modernity of Abstract Expressionism, this meant ""nice but old-fashioned."" De Hory sold only one. He blamed the opening night's heavy January snowfall. De Hory had, however, sold a handful of forgeries in Europe. Over the next decade, he traveled America and impersonated an aristocrat fallen on hard times after the war. He sold forgeries in the style of some artists who were still alive -- Picasso and Matisse -- and created so many forgeries of Amedeo Modigliani that it has become impossible to compile a definitive catalog of the artist's work, according to Kenneth Wayne, director of The Modigliani Project.

Several hundred forgeries later, a handful of dealers caught on to him, told the authorities and ran him out of the country. When Mr. Forgy met de Hory, it was on the beach of the Spanish island Ibiza, in 1969. A series of recent scandals had connected de Hory to forgeries in the U.S. and France. Yet, in Spain he was safe from consequences. So he embraced his new persona: the great forger who had fooled the art world. De Hory teamed up with the novelist Clifford Irving, who, taking de Hory's exaggerations and inventions at face value, wrote a best-selling biography of the forger, ""FAKE!"" (Irving's next project was a fraudulent autobiography of Howard Hughes, which landed him in jail.) Into this era of mythmaking stepped the 20-year old Mr. Forgy. The two became close, and with its four-decade age gap, their friendship resembled that of teacher and student. De Hory would give etiquette lessons for royal company (the correct manner to kiss a princess's hand) and regular tests on art history (""When did Botticelli live?"").

""He was more of a father than my actual father,"" said Mr. Forgy, now 70. ""He was concerned with my future."" In his lectures on art, Mr. Forgy said, ""Elmyr was always attempting mightily to champion the intrinsic merit of art as opposed to having a name tag on it."" He hated the market's obsession with famous names. De Hory also made it clear that if his works could pass for original that made them, and him, as good as the greats.

After six years together, however, their friendship came to an end. De Hory was battling a new extradition request to France. When the news came that the extradition had been granted, Mr. Forgy was the one who told de Hory. On Dec. 11, 1976, de Hory killed himself. He left everything to Mr. Forgy, who returned to Minnesota with around 300 of de Hory's works. For decades he fell silent and moved on. Only in 2007 did he begin a memoir. After he self-published it in 2012, he adapted it into a play and then a musical. A new purpose for himself took shape as the caretaker of de Hory's legacy. Mr. Forgy lent works to exhibitions on art forgery and recounted the story of the lovable rascal whose mischief turned the art world upside down. People found the story irresistible. Some were so intoxicated by it that a small market emerged for de Hory's forgeries and pastiches. Mr. Forgy said that in 2014 a de Hory in the style of Matisse sold for $28,000. Other pieces have gone for a few thousand or hundred. Mr. Forgy now believes this new exhibition can bring de Hory the recognition he sought during his life. The paintings were done in Ibiza and many are quick snapshots of friends, including several of Mr. Forgy. Some are unfinished or pulled from de Hory's sketchbook. The variety of styles is striking. There are many that evoke the artists he forged. The playful simplicity of some of his drawing wobbles between channeling and being derivative of Matisse.

The most revealing painting is perhaps de Hory's self-portrait. Dark and haunted with opaque eyes, it is unfinished. The uncertainty with how to ultimately portray himself is perhaps de Hory at his most human, and his most honest.

Health,Uninsured Find More Success via Health Exchanges Run by States,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/us/politics/uninsured-find-more-success-via-health-exchanges-run-by-states.html,"WASHINGTON -- Robyn J. Skrebes of Minneapolis said she was able to sign up for health insurance in about two hours on Monday using the Web site of the state-run insurance exchange in Minnesota, known as MNsure. Ms. Skrebes, who is 32 and uninsured, said she had selected a policy costing $179 a month, before tax credit subsidies, and also had obtained Medicaid coverage for her 2-year-old daughter, Emma. ""I am thrilled,"" Ms. Skrebes said, referring to her policy. ""It's affordable, good coverage. And the Web site of the Minnesota exchange was pretty simple to use, pretty straightforward. The language was really clear."" The experience described by Ms. Skrebes is in stark contrast to reports of widespread technical problems that have hampered enrollment in the online health insurance marketplace run by the federal government since it opened on Oct. 1. While many people have been frustrated in their efforts to obtain coverage through the federal exchange, which is used by more than 30 states, consumers have had more success signing up for health insurance through many of the state-run exchanges, federal and state officials and outside experts say. Alan R. Weil, the executive director of the National Academy for State Health Policy, an independent nonpartisan group, credited the relative early success of some state exchanges to the fact that they could leap on problems more quickly than the sprawling, complex federal marketplace.

""Individual state operations are more adaptable,"" Mr. Weil said. ""That does not mean that states get everything right. But they can respond more quickly to solve problems as they arise."" In addition, some states allow consumers to shop for insurance, comparing costs and benefits of different policies, without first creating an online account -- a barrier for many people trying to use the federal exchange. The state-run exchange in New York announced Tuesday that it had signed up more than 40,000 people who applied for insurance and were found eligible. ""This fast pace of sign-ups shows that New York State's exchange is working smoothly with an overwhelming response from New Yorkers eager to get access to low-cost health insurance,"" said Donna Frescatore, the executive director of the state exchange. In Washington State, the state-run exchange had a rocky start on Oct. 1, but managed to turn things around quickly by adjusting certain parameters on its Web site to alleviate bottlenecks. By Monday, more than 9,400 people had signed up for coverage. The Washington Health Benefit Exchange does not require users to create an account before browsing plans.

""The site is up and running smoothly,"" said Michael Marchand, a spokesman for the Washington exchange. ""We're seeing a lot of use, a lot of people coming to the Web site. If anything, I think it's increasing."" Other states reporting a steady stream of enrollments in recent days include California, Connecticut, Kentucky and Rhode Island. In Connecticut, a spokesman for the state-run exchange, Access Health CT, said users have generally had a smooth experience with the Web site other than ""a couple of bumps and hiccups on the first day."" By Monday afternoon, the Connecticut exchange had processed 1,175 applications, said the spokesman, Jason Madrak. Daniel N. Mendelson, the chief executive of Avalere Health, a research and consulting company, said: ""On balance, the state exchanges are doing better than the federal exchange. The federal exchange has, for all practical purposes, been impenetrable. Systems problems are preventing any sort of meaningful engagement."" ""By contrast,"" said Mr. Mendelson, who was a White House budget official under President Bill Clinton, ""in most states, we can get information about what is being offered and the prices, and some states are allowing full enrollment. All the state exchanges that we have visited are doing better than the federal exchange at this point."" In California, Peter V. Lee, the executive director of the state-run exchange, said that more than 16,000 applications had been completed in the first five days of open enrollment. Mr. Lee said that while the consumer experience ""hasn't been perfect,"" it has been ""pretty darn good.""

Some state-run exchanges have run into difficulties because they rely on the federal marketplace for parts of the application process, like verifying an applicant's identity. Minnesota, Nevada and Rhode Island are among the states that have reported problems with the ""identity-proofing"" process, which requires state-run exchanges to communicate with the federal data hub. Brandon Hardy, 31, of Louisville, Ky., was one of the first to sign up for health insurance through Kentucky's state-run exchange, working with an application counselor who guided him through the process last Wednesday. Mr. Hardy, who is uninsured and has epileptic seizures that land him in the hospital every few months, spent about 45 minutes filling out the online application, and learned that he would be eligible for Medicaid under the health care law. ""It was pretty easy,"" Mr. Hardy said of the process. ""What I really need is a neurologist, and now hopefully that will happen. This is like a huge relief."" Attempts to sign up for coverage through the federal marketplace have often proved more frustrating. Bruce A. Charette, 60, of Tulsa, Okla., said he had been trying to log onto the Web site for the federal exchange since last Wednesday, but had not been able to see the available plans or their rates. Mr. Charette said he was asked verification questions that did not appear to match his identity. One question, he said, asked about the name of a pet for which he had purchased health insurance two years ago. ""I don't have any pets,"" he said. ""It's obvious that the site is overloaded,"" said Mr. Charette, an electrician who works in the aviation industry and said he did not have health insurance. ""I am not going to stare at a computer screen for 45 minutes, waiting for a response. It looks as if the Web site is freezing up.""",The experience is in stark contrast to reports of widespread technical problems that have hampered enrollment in the online marketplace run by the federal government.,7bf689ed-1d8a-51c8-8563-481ca945a391,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/09/us/JP-HEALTH/JP-HEALTH-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=591c3957e16f8003dba94e4a13ac3b89b0556b5586f568651068f691596e6044&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Glenys Espinal, left, and Randall Downey assisted Elsa Gomez on Tuesday in Las Vegas with details about Nevada's state-run health insurance exchange.",7bf689ed-1d8a-51c8-8563-481ca945a391,N24News/imgs/7bf689ed-1d8a-51c8-8563-481ca945a391.jpg,1
Health,"Ethel Paley, Champion of Nursing Home Patients, Dies at 99",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/26/health/ethel-paley-dead.html,"Ethel Paley, a social worker who for 35 years was at the forefront of helping nursing home patients and their families navigate the labyrinthine health care system, redress hidden abuses in treatment and lobby for systemic solutions, died on Nov. 18 at her home in Manhattan.

Her death was confirmed by her daughter Eliza Paley.

From the organization's inception at the height of the scandals over nursing home care in New York in 1976 until it went broke in 2011 after the recession, Ms. Paley dedicated her career to Friends and Relatives of the Institutionalized Aged, a nonprofit organization of which she was the founding executive director.

Even after she stepped down from that post in 1979, she continued to serve the agency and her elderly peers for decades, well into her own advanced age, variously as president, board member, paid staff member and volunteer.

""Even though it was descriptive, our full name still reeked of a 'social work' look at the world,"" Ms. Paley recalled in 2011 , ""so we eventually dropped it and just use ' Fria ' instead.""","Well into her own advanced age, she guided nursing home residents and their surrogates in navigating a labyrinthine and sometimes abusive health care system.",a5dc31a7-f8d1-53c8-b880-1782b9dfc944,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/30/obituaries/26Paley-sub/26Paley-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=2ca5d6bcf93f5229e041aa83c9a6fbb06e407955150395516280078bdb3bc90b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ethel Paley, who championed the rights and care of elderly nursing home residents, with Gov.

Technology,Facebook's Security Chief to Depart for Stanford University,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/01/technology/facebook-security-alex-stamos.html,"Mr. Stamos' departure is part of several executive exits from the social network, which has been hit by scandals including Russian meddling on the platform in the 2016 presidential election and misuse of people's data. The Times reported that Mr. Stamos was leaving Facebook after he had advocated the company to disclose more about Russian election interference last year but was met with resistance.

Mr. Stamos said in the interview that his last day at Facebook would be Aug. 17. At Stanford, he said, he planned to study the upcoming midterms and the role of technology, as well as election security more broadly and the topic of disinformation. He said he would also look at subjects as basic as passwords and try to reimagine how they could be made more secure.

Mr. Stamos also said Information Warfare was a new working group at Stanford with about 14 faculty members across academic disciplines. The group, which will begin meeting this fall, plans to research information warfare tactics and to develop countermeasures. Mr. Stamos said he planned to teach a class for law and policy students on how hackers attack, with the goal of familiarizing future policymakers with common hacking techniques.

Of his time at Facebook, he said, ""Obviously, it has been a difficult three years. I'd like to take the things I've learned and apply them more broadly.""

Mr. Stamos previously worked as chief information security officer at Yahoo before joining Facebook in 2015. He has been vocal about cybersecurity issues. For example, in an address last year at Black Hat, a cybersecurity conference in Las Vegas, he argued that security professionals were overly focused on solving problems that were complex or bizarre and had lost sight of the everyday problems that plagued the internet.

Mr. Stamos said that over the course of his career, he had worked as a consultant for all of the major tech companies in Silicon Valley. That would help in his new role at Stanford, he said.

""Part of my goal is to help people find the right folks at these companies, to come up with structures in which we can have cross-disciplinary academic study,"" he said, adding that he wanted to address issues including online child safety and the naming of a country or group responsible for a cyberattack.

""There aren't good norms around a lot these things yet,"" Mr. Stamos said.","Alex Stamos, Facebook's chief security officer, is joining Stanford to teach and to examine the role of security and technology in society.",b671a4ca-9d9e-5672-8cbf-000ade9c55bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/02/business/02stamos-print/02stamos1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b665a0a2444f90526537a9f164c01a380b7efb165dabd47b29c078064955c7af&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Alex Stamos is leaving Facebook at a time when the social network is grappling with potential threats including election meddling and hackers.,b671a4ca-9d9e-5672-8cbf-000ade9c55bf,N24News/imgs/b671a4ca-9d9e-5672-8cbf-000ade9c55bf.jpg,20
Economy,Slower Growth in Jobs Report May Give Fed Pause on Interest Rates,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/03/business/economy/jobs-report-hiring-unemployment-wages-fed-interest-rates.html,"That is the verdict from economists after the Labor Department reported on Friday that in August employers added 151,000 jobs, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 4.9 percent, and wage gains were modest. It was a solid performance that keeps the economy on track, but not strong enough to push the Federal Reserve to raise its benchmark interest rate when policy makers meet this month. ""It confirms that the economy is performing well, but does not provide the threat of overheating that might have caused an interest-rate increase sooner rather than later,"" said Carl R. Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust. Since the financial crisis, the Fed has raised interest rates just once, in December, from near zero. Low rates are intended to encourage businesses to borrow and invest, but Fed policy makers are now split between those who worry that reducing this economic stimulus would undermine growth and those who fear that waiting could allow inflation to take hold. Republicans and Democrats mined the report for evidence that supported the economic arguments they will make through the November election. How to handle a recovery that has delivered steady but less than spectacular growth has not only been a flash point among Fed bankers -- who will next meet on Sept. 20 and 21 -- but also between the presidential candidates Donald J. Trump and Hillary Clinton.

For the Trump campaign, which has suggested that recent employment figures have understated the dire state of the labor market, the decline in manufacturing jobs was another sign that the policies of the Obama administration were leaving blue-collar workers behind. Mr. Trump, a Republican, has also railed against trade deals, blaming them for jobs lost to Mexico and China, as part of his strategy to appeal to disaffected white, working-class voters. ""The latest economic numbers from the past day paint a bleak picture,"" said Curtis Ellis, a senior economic adviser to Mr. Trump. Hoping to attract those same working-class voters, Mrs. Clinton, a Democrat, has proposed public investments in infrastructure like roads, affordable housing and renewable energy. Jacob Leibenluft, an economic adviser to the Clinton campaign, said that she was focused on dealing with ""the challenge of not enough good-paying jobs and the general sense of economic insecurity that persists."" At the same time, Democrats have pointed to the positive signs in the overall economy, highlighting sturdy job growth in the private sector that has lasted a record 78 months, and a low jobless rate.

""A kind of ho-hum status quo economy might not have been good enough for Clinton against a normal Republican candidate,"" Kyle Kondik, of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics, said. ""But against Trump maybe it will be enough."" The jobless rate, based on a separate survey of households, stayed at 4.9 percent, roughly half of what it was seven years ago, and consumer spending remains healthy. But a broader measure of unemployment that includes discouraged and underemployed workers is nearly twice that figure. Wages have only recently begun to climb. The 12-month increase was a modest 2.4 percent in August, slower than in the previous month but a pace that keeps most workers ahead of inflation. Another report released on Friday offered more encouraging news, showing that the United States trade deficit shrank sharply, by 11.6 percent in July from the previous month, because of an increase in American exports. Earlier, monthly job gains flip-flopped, plummeting to 24,000 in May and swelling to more than 10 times that number in June and July. As Labor Secretary Thomas E. Perez said, ""Sometimes the porridge is really hot; sometimes the porridge is really cold; this one is in between.""

Revised estimates from the Labor Department left the hearty totals from the previous two reports little changed and took the three-month average of monthly job gains to 232,000 after big gains of 271,000 in June and 275,000 in July. The August estimate is subject to two more revisions. Economists, who estimate that the nation needs about 100,000 new jobs every month to keep up with population growth, say it is natural for the jobs machine to slow as the pool of unemployed workers gradually dries up. Still, large numbers of prime-age workers remain out of the labor market altogether, widening the gap between the haves and the have-nots and depressing wage gains. ""A lot of people are still on the bench that could come into the labor market,"" said Ken Esch, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers or PwC, an accounting and consulting network. ""Until more people are participating, I don't see the inflationary pressures, and our data says we don't expect to see much over the next 12 months."" A recent PwC survey of private companies found that fewer than half of respondents planned to add positions in the next 12 months, a decrease from the first quarter of 2016, and that companies expected to increase wages, but by less than 3 percent. Retirements in the baby boom generation are also playing a role in keeping wage gains modest.

Diversity in wage growth is wide. ""Most of the best gains are in skilled jobs, like tech, health care and finance,"" Mr. Chamberlain said. ""There are very poor wage gains in many blue-collar professions, especially manufacturing and energy,"" two areas that have also been shedding jobs. Ian Siegel, a founder and the chief executive of ZipRecruiter, which distributes job postings primarily from small and midsize businesses, said he had noticed that ""the number of jobs posted stayed flat, but there's been a shift in mix,"" with a ""big increase in medium-skilled jobs."" His observations are in line with a report released last month by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York that found the American economy was creating more middle-income jobs, basically defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as those paying $30,000 to $60,000 a year. ""The tide has begun to turn,"" William C. Dudley, president of the New York Fed, said when the report was released. ""For the first time in quite a while, we are seeing gains in middle-wage jobs actually outnumber gains in higher- and lower-wage jobs nationwide."" Dan Finnigan, chief executive of Jobvite, a recruiting service used by start-ups, said the tightening job market might be prying open more opportunities for younger workers. ""I'm hearing without a doubt that employers are taking more risks and are forced to hire less experienced people for jobs,"" he said. In his view, older workers who were able to delay retirement when the recession hit did so, blocking more junior employees from moving up the pipeline. That clog is finally beginning to clear. The growing number of retirees accounts to some degree for the droopy labor force participation rate, offsetting the number of sidelined workers who have rejoined the labor force, Jason Furman, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, said. At the same time, Mr. Furman acknowledged that a large proportion of prime-age workers, 25 to 54, particularly men, remained outside the circle of work. This group's participation rate, now at 88 percent, started slipping decades ago, he said, but the decline in the United States has been much sharper than in advanced Western European economies.

""That leads me to the conclusion that it is not caused by technology but is a result of institutional and policy choices we've made as a country,"" Mr. Furman said. ""For women, we do very little to subsidize child care or make workplaces flexible. When it comes to men, we spend very little money to train people for jobs or find jobs."" Jonas Prising, chairman and chief executive of the ManpowerGroup, one of the largest recruiters in the United States, agreed that low participation rates were troubling, despite the improving labor market. ""It may look like full employment,"" he said, ""but it's not full employment.""","The American economy added 151,000 jobs last month, a performance that could support the position of those within the Fed who favor delaying an interest-rate increase.",92947935-a291-534c-960f-3cd4718fff5f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/02/business/03JOBS/03JOBS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=f8cb79b4a639b2e9237169cd835dcb2407d58191904f3dd9400c1c6556d01516&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A worker walking past the Smithsonian's National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.

Well,Well Illustrated: Visions at the End of Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/22/well/live/end-of-life-art-drawing-palliative-care.html,"Recently I talked to a man in his 60s who grew up in a small coastal town near Houston. He loved the Texas coast and its beaches. I asked him, as I usually do, if he had an image in his mind that had meaning for him. He had been thinking about a raindrop he had seen at home before he had been admitted. He talked about how far it had traveled, how it had gone through a storm and it had endured to be a unique drop at this moment on his windowpane.

I thought about the image. The drop would dissolve and be absorbed into the earth, like all of us. I drew what he was describing: a window looking out on subtle shapes of trees and bushes, a narrow path obscured by slanting lines of rain, and in the center of the pane, a raindrop. He took the drawing and held it closely. There was his raindrop, a small oval shape on a piece of white paper. He looked at me as if we had discovered the universe. I ask patients to talk about what they love, what has meaning to them. Often the responses are about loved ones, spouses and children, fishing in the bay. Sometimes the patient wants to create an artwork with his or her own hands. Sometimes I create a collage of images: children, horses, flowers, sunsets and sunrises, the beach, a dog, a sport. I've drawn the Texas A&M football stadium and Mickey Mouse with an angel because they meant something to a patient.

I connected with MD Anderson because my husband was a patient there. He died in 2000, and losing him was the most difficult experience of my life. I felt flayed. It took me a long time and many paintings to deal with the raw grief. The first moments when I enter a patient's room are fragile and tender. Some patients are very beautiful in repose and seem at peace. Their partners or family members want me to draw them like that. Once a woman whose husband had just died asked their nurse if I would come to their room and draw them lying together.

Recently I saw a young woman who was so ill she could barely talk. When I told her I was an artist, she perked up a little. She was bald, her skin was sallow, and a palm-sized bandage covered the port on her chest through which her chemotherapy had flowed for months. When I asked her if she had an image in her mind, she said, ""dying."" ""How do you see this?"" I asked. ""Just lying in bed dying,"" she said. ""Would you like me to draw you?"" ""Yes,"" she said. I bent down to my bag for a sketchbook and pencil, and when I looked up, she was sitting on the edge of the bed. She appeared to have shaken off all the cancer and chemicals in her body. Her back was straight and her head was high. She looked at me unflinchingly, proud as a queen, projecting all the beauty within her. She was no longer ""just lying in bed dying."" When I handed her the drawing she clasped it to her chest and said, ""Incredible."" This was the image she wanted for her mother and her children.

There was the woman who, with her skeletal hand, could still draw herself hanging from a line attached to a butterfly in whose wings she had drawn the life-lines of her own hand. And there was the man who told me, ""I am a murderer, a rapist, a robber and a thief."" He was seeking forgiveness, mostly from himself, and cried when I drew him kneeling in a circle of fire with rays of light descending to his body.","On the palliative care floor of MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, drawing the things patients have no words for.",0fed670d-ced5-5ca3-a51d-31f006219d49,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/07/well/family/well-randolph4/well-randolph4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=335&w=640&s=015d0eae6de29c81432b09771048ba26a2deb7c23dd540fd533d3708235d82b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Her Soul's Visit,"" from a series about end-of-life experiences by Lynn Randolph, an artist in residence in the palliative care unit at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.",0fed670d-ced5-5ca3-a51d-31f006219d49,N24News/imgs/0fed670d-ced5-5ca3-a51d-31f006219d49.jpg,18
Movies,John Singleton Did Justice to a Poetic Vision of African-American Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/30/movies/john-singleton-boyz-n-the-hood.html,"""Boyz N the Hood"" rests in American movie history like a boulder in a riverbed, altering the direction of the stream. After its release in the summer of 1991, everything looked different, including its precursors. ""Mean Streets,"" ""Rebel Without a Cause,"" the Blaxploitation spectacles of the 1970s, the socially conscious crime dramas of the 1930s, classic westerns and samurai epics -- somehow John Singleton, a very recent graduate of the University of Southern California film school, synthesized all of those models even as he came up with something bracingly, thrillingly and frighteningly new. ""Boyz"" made him the youngest person -- and the first African-American -- nominated for a best directing Academy Award. In the annals of cinema, there aren't many first features to match it for ambition and impact (""Citizen Kane""? ""Breathless""?), and its influence on what came after is hard to overstate. Singleton, who died Monday at 51, filled his characters' lives with warmth and humor even as they were constantly menaced, and often destroyed, by violence. He infused familiar coming-of-age and gangster-movie tropes with a rare authenticity. This wasn't just a matter of his intimate knowledge of the setting known then as South-Central Los Angeles, but also of his brave, even brazen confidence in himself and his audience.

[Read the John Singleton obituary and a recent interview with him. | See where to stream his best films.] A blazing debut can be a hard act to follow, and Singleton's second film, ""Poetic Justice"" (1993), didn't enjoy the same success, at least with critics, as its predecessor. But when I heard the news of Singleton's passing, ""Poetic Justice"" was the movie I found myself thinking about. Partly because its earnest sentiments -- its open-heartedness about creativity, love and loss -- seemed most apt for mourning an artist who left too soon. Grief, after all, has been part of the film's legacy since its male star, Tupac Shakur, was murdered in 1996. And there may be no purer dose of early-'90s nostalgia than watching Shakur and Janet Jackson travel the romantic-comedy arc, their progress from conflict to harmony punctuated by the poems of Maya Angelou and breathtaking vistas of the California countryside.

""Poetic Justice"" is, in its way, as influential as ""Boyz N the Hood"" and as political as ""Higher Learning"" and ""Rosewood,"" Singleton's subsequent confrontations with past and present-day manifestations of American racism. ""Poetic Justice"" begins with a sly and pointed critique of Hollywood representation. A note tells us we're in South-Central, but the images are of high-rise, well-heeled Manhattan, where a white couple, played by Billy Zane and Lori Petty, are drinking wine in a penthouse. The joke is that this is a movie-within-the-movie showing at a Los Angeles drive-in. (The marquee tells us that it's called ""Deadly Diva"" and has an NC-17 rating.) The patrons, including Jackson's Justice and her boyfriend (Q-Tip of A Tribe Called Quest), don't look like the people onscreen, but they've bought tickets anyway, as generations of black and Latinx moviegoers have before them. With a few exceptions, it's always been that way.

""Poetic Justice"" sets out to change that situation, by every means available. The stylized, consequence-free gunplay of ""Deadly Diva"" is soon drowned out by a shooting that pulls what seemed like an '80s-vintage teen comedy into the brutal world of ""Boyz N the Hood."" Within a few minutes, before the opening titles have even scrolled, we've swerved from satire to sex farce to tragedy, and Singleton is only getting started. Eventually, Justice and Lucky (Shakur's character) will set off for Oakland in a Postal Service truck with their friends Iesha (Regina King) and Chicago (Joe Torry), and ""Poetic Justice"" will turn into a road movie. Before their departure, Singleton lingers over the funny and painful details of their lives at home and at work, sketching a portrait of working-class black life that looks back to the radical neo-realism of the L.A. Rebellion and forward to the businesslike striving of the ""Barbershop"" franchise. The casting of two stars of popular music as a hairdresser (Jackson) and a mailman (Shakur) doesn't so much glamorize the characters as affirm the realness that the performers had already established as the cornerstone of their appeal.

Between Los Angeles and the Bay Area, the four travelers journey through a kind of utopian space. Not that everything is harmonious among them. Iesha and Chicago have some issues, and Lucky and Justice are barely on speaking terms. Harsh words are exchanged, followed by a few slaps and punches. But the movie's close attention to this interpersonal friction might cause you to notice what isn't in the picture. There are no police on the highway and almost no white people (except for a belligerent truck driver at a gas station). Justice and company crash a family reunion, where Maya Angelou herself dispenses wisdom and passes judgment on her temporary nieces and nephews. They stop at a cultural festival where revolutionary poets and drummers hold the stage.

This dream evaporates in Oakland, where a shooting has claimed the life of Lucky's cousin and rap partner. The point of the film's long, languorous middle was never to imagine an escape from violence and racism, but to show some of the richness and variety of life in their shadows, to free the characters from the obligation to behave like symbols or avatars of social problems. Watching ""Poetic Justice"" now, I was put in mind of Barry Jenkins's recent ""If Beale Street Could Talk,"" and not only because Regina King is (splendidly) in both films. Their visual and storytelling styles are very different, but Jenkins and Singleton are directors whose primary motivation is their unstinting love for the people they conjure into being. They push aside the noise of plot to capture the quiet intensity of ordinary moments and the poetry of everyday experience. They notice beauty everywhere. ""Beale Street"" and ""Poetic Justice"" are stories of black artists falling in love in a world that tends to devalue both their creativity and their feelings, and each movie simultaneously illuminates those struggles and shares in them, in a spirit that is sorrowful but never grim or despairing. My point isn't to establish a lineage, but to identify a common spirit, and to measure the shape and size of the doorway that Singleton made, an opening wide enough for so many others to walk through.","His influence extended backward and forward; a look at some of the ways he changed the course of American movies, like the work of Barry Jenkins.",929acac0-45a3-5b39-95b6-e87106408e56,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/01/arts/30singleton-appraisal2/30singleton-appraisal2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=24fc1a70461b2c0a0c80a08a7a75b63b2afbdfefd5dbea6cc90fe282bc01cb67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Maya Angelou with John Singleton in 1993, the year ""Poetic Justice"" was released.",929acac0-45a3-5b39-95b6-e87106408e56,N24News/imgs/929acac0-45a3-5b39-95b6-e87106408e56.jpg,5
Art & Design,A Collection That Owes Its Existence to a 'Carpe Diem' Event,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/arts/design/show-us-your-wall-ellen-marmur.html,"Ellen Marmur and her art collection. Top, a decorative light fixture by Lumens (2005), and photographs, from left, Susan Paulsen's ""Katonah"" (1998) and ""Bedford"" (1997).





The dermatologist Ellen Marmur says she has always appreciated a striking painting or photograph, but she only began collecting art seriously after she learned she had skin cancer in 2006. ""When I got cancer, my philosophy became very much about 'carpe diem' and living my best life now,"" she said. ""Part of that life means collecting beautiful art because art gives me such joy."" Dr. Marmur , who recently had a recurrence of aggressive but not life-threatening basal-cell cancer, has gathered a sizable collection of contemporary paintings and photography by American artists. Many live in or around New York, including Tara Donovan, a sculptor from Brooklyn who likes to use disposable items like toothpicks and straws in her work; April Gornik, known for her landscape paintings, who resides in Sag Harbor; and another Long Island resident, Zu Sheng Yu, a Chinese artist who focuses on oil paintings and sculptures. Dr. Marmur, 50, lives in a light-flooded, white-walled Upper East Side apartment looking out on the East River with her husband, Jonathan Marmur, 60, the chief of cardiology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center, their children: J onah; 22 Julien, 15; Sasha, 14; and Ezra, 12 .

These are edited excerpts from the conversation. What kind of art are you attracted to? I like the story behind the work and look at each of my pieces as a novel. My father was a Shakespeare professor, and understanding humanity through literature is how I grew up.

Do you have a favorite work? The piece by James Turrell called ""Aten Reign"" blows my mind. He did a light installation at the Guggenheim in 2013 that was also called ""Aten Reign."" You were supposed to lie down in the lobby and look up. It was like being transported into the galaxy. This is an image of the inside of the museum and looks like a sphere. The oil painting in the kitchen by Zu Sheng Yu is another favorite. It's of white birch trees against a yellow background. It reminds me of when I was a canoe wilderness guide in Minnesota in college. The barks of the trees have what look to me like eyes. They personify the tree. I ended up buying more of his pieces, including one of pears.

You own several works by female artists. Can you talk about your favorite piece by a woman? Probably the one by Tara Donovan in the foyer. She transforms everyday items into art. With this piece, she has stuck pins in cardboard and painted the tops black. They look abstract and could be flowers or movement or anything you want them to be. Everyone who looks at it sees something different. It's simple yet complex and really freeing.

Where do you usually buy your art? I either go directly to the artists or to galleries I have a relationship with, like Pace where I've got a lot of my works. I get nervous going into different galleries because they seem so formal sometimes. How involved is your husband in the art you buy? Jonathan loves art, but he would never buy it. He would rather buy a car, but I do consider art a collaborative purchase. I find what I love, set it aside and have him go see it. It makes me feel good when he likes what I do. I trust his taste. Tell me about the piece in your dining room with the six pears. I am obsessed with pears. They're very human to me -- especially their skin -- and supple and beautiful. These pears are a picture by Susan Paulsen and represent the six people in my family. One of the pears is red, so I always ask ""Who is the red pear in our family?"" What's the first piece of art you bought that's in your apartment now? The painting of colorful boats in my bedroom, which is the most meaningful work to me in that room. It's a watercolor on silk by an unknown artist, and I got it on a street in Jaffa 30 years ago on my first trip to Israel. I think I paid $100 for it. It matters a lot to me because it's come with me through much of my life.",Ellen Marmur's skin cancer reset her course.

Television,Nine Shows to Catch at the New York Comedy Festival,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/arts/television/new-york-comedy-festival.html,"For a week starting Monday, the 16th annual New York Comedy Festival will feature more than 100 events spread across the five boroughs. This year's headlining shows include Stephen Colbert, Norm Macdonald and the long-running ""Stand Up for Heroes,"" a fund-raiser for military veterans that features Jon Stewart and Bruce Springsteen. The festival also has its share of rising talent from across the globe, representing a diverse new wave of solo stand-up, podcasts and more. Cat Cohen, Larry Owens and ""Butterboy,"" the red-hot Brooklyn weekly show will be among the new favorites on hand. Here are nine shows that will be the best bets to become headliners of future festivals. Tickets and additional information is available at nycomedyfestival.com.

Ignoring an uncomfortable issue guarantees no solution will be found. And if an issue feels too widespread or intractable? Might as well get in some laughs. Yedoye Travis is a master at mixing frankness with the funny on his podcast featuring a panel of black comedians assessing a white comedian pitching corrective measures to counteract racism. Think social justice meets ""Shark Tank ."" Whether working on the Jon Stewart or David Letterman television shows or Adult Swim's decidedly hard-edge ""Soft Focus With Jena Friedman,"" this stand-up has never been one to mute her opinions or shy from controversial takes. Her new live show, ""Miscarriage of Justice,"" is no exception. Last year on ""Conan,"" she deplored the rise of Nazis ; Friedman's current material squarely tackles misogyny, police brutality and the abuse of political power. She's outraged and her comedy may not be for everyone. But that's exactly how Friedman prefers it.

This New York scene staple is as fearlessly old school as they come. Kirson unleashes an arsenal of characters (Jewish and otherwise), recalls sexual escapades aplenty and derives a devilishly unfettered pleasure from letting her frayed nerves fire at will. (The title of her new podcast, ""Relatively Sane,"" proves self-explanatory.) Kirson has been seen on late-night TV and sitcoms; her long-overdue debut hour special, ""Talking to Myself,"" premieres Dec. 6 on Comedy Central. Most comedy fans know improv's golden rule: ""Yes, and ...,"" in which one performer agrees to another's established scenario before adding new information. Fewer civilians are aware that stand-ups help each other create new material via a collective writing-craft game nicknamed ""Joke Machine."" Joe Zimmerman and Emmy Blotnick bring this behind-the-scenes tradition in front of a crowd as comic guests hunt for more powerful premises, stronger segues and tighter taglines.

Sometimes less is more. Hollering, pulling faces and stool humping don't necessarily cement authentic connections with audiences. In the case of the ""Daily Show With Trevor Noah"" writer Josh Johnson, a Louisiana background informs his measured, low-key delivery, while his theater-kid background taught him to coax laughter from extended pauses that could send other comics sprinting to the next punch line. Johnson's self-deprecating narratives detail personal battles with allergies, arthritis, insomnia, panic attacks, rat attacks, possum attacks and even a gang that kicked him out for being too polite. Slow burn, aw-shucks storytelling at its finest. The concept is simple: The names of novice comics are pulled from a bucket. The quaking hopefuls perform for one minute. The host Tony Hinchcliffe, the producer Brian Redban and celebrity guest judges offer quips, critiques, questions, outright condemnation or a combination thereof. With a live band led by Jeremiah Watkins, insults aplenty and killer callbacks, the Deathsquad network's popular podcast and YouTube livestream has evolved from the Main Room of the Comedy Store in Los Angeles to sold-out international dates, all featuring an unflinching brand of controlled chaos. At the intersection of stand-up and visual art there's ""Portrait of the Artist Seated With Grapes"" : Max Wittert turning his pen (and brushes) on his own life as a TV actor, comedy writer and illustrator of projects that include fashion models or comic-book characters (and occasionally comic-book characters posing as fashion models). Just how style-focused will this show be? Wittert tweeted that attendees are encouraged to dress in ball gowns, and he might not be joking.

Prohibited from joining the cheerleading squad in high school, young Zach Zimmerman's life changed when he became the first member of his Roanoke, Va., family to attend college. While his mother dismissed the experience as ""liberalizing"" and ""heathenizing,"" he recognized it as the freedom to be himself.

Science,How to Watch the Geminids Meteor Shower 2019 This Weekend,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/science/geminids-meteor-shower-2019.html,"All year long as Earth revolves around the sun, it passes through streams of cosmic debris. The resulting meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse.

The next shower you might be able to see is the Geminids. Active from Dec. 4 to Dec. 17, the show peaks around Friday night into Saturday morning, or Dec. 13-14.

The Geminids, along with the Quadrantids that peaked in January, are believed to originate not from comets, but from asteroid-like space rocks. The Geminids are thought to have been produced by an object called 3200 Phaethon. If you manage to see them, this meteor shower can brighten the night sky with between 120 and 160 meteors per hour.

Where meteor showers come from

If you spot a meteor shower, what you're usually seeing is an icy comet's leftovers that crash into Earth's atmosphere. Comets are sort of like dirty snowballs: As they travel through the solar system, they leave behind a dusty trail of rocks and ice that lingers in space long after they leave. When Earth passes through these cascades of comet waste, the bits of debris -- which can be as small as grains of sand -- pierce the sky at such speeds that they burst, creating a celestial fireworks display.","Meteor showers can light up night skies from dusk to dawn, and if you're lucky you might be able to catch a glimpse.",2d33c894-a507-5ad8-84b8-c575e9631890,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/19/science/space-calendar-geminids/space-calendar-geminids-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bb017e6ef0bfebb064077c9314776310641351ed4c0747e515d8a981f2db9d61&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A meteor from the Geminids streaking between the peaks of the Seven Sister rock formation in Nevada in 2010.,2d33c894-a507-5ad8-84b8-c575e9631890,N24News/imgs/2d33c894-a507-5ad8-84b8-c575e9631890.jpg,2
Television,"With 'NOS4A2,' Joe Hill Finally Sinks His Teeth Into TV",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/31/arts/television/nos4a2-joe-hill-amc.html,"""It's kind of a gold rush, right?"" Joe Hill said. In addition to the AMC show, his comic-book title ""Locke & Key"" and two short stories are being picked up for the screen.





On a sunny spring morning in a hotel near Central Park, the writer Joe Hill settled into an overstuffed chair before an 18th-century-style fireplace, received tea and sandwiches -- rectangular, crusts removed -- and stroked his graying beard. He was there to talk about a vile old man with rotten teeth who feasts on the souls of young children. The contrast was one he seemed to relish, with self-awareness. ""The tea I'm drinking is called Mystical Creatures , which is a little bit on the nose for today's themes,"" he said. ""But we'll roll with it."" Those themes, in no particular order, included: vampirism; feminism; supernaturalism; sadism; his father, the best-selling novelist Stephen King; and his own best-selling novel ""NOS4A2,"" which has been developed into a TV series that debuts Sunday on AMC. An update to the classic vampire tale (the title is a play on ""Nosferatu""), the series follows a supernaturally gifted young heroine from a broken New England home and her battles against the villain Charlie Manx, who carries children off in a demonic Rolls-Royce to a terrifying place called Christmasland. ""NOS4A2,"" Hill's third novel, was an obvious fit for television. ""NOS4A2"" is both the first of Hill's stories to make it to the small screen and one of several TV projects he now has in the works, a dramatic reversal of fortune after multiple stalled attempts. Misfires included a reboot of George A. Romero's horror series ""Tales From the Darkside,"" which never made it past the pilot stage after Hill wrote several scripts, and two adaptations of ""Locke & Key,"" a comic Hill did with the artist Gabriel Rodriguez. Separate pilots were produced for each -- first for Fox, then for Hulu -- but both were dropped.

Then suddenly, abundance: In addition to ""NOS4A2 ,"" ""Locke & Key"" was finally picked up for a Netflix series, which is expected to debut by early next year. A Netflix film based on ""In the Tall Grass,"" a short story Hill wrote with his father, is expected this fall. And in a development that completes a personal circle for Hill, the streaming service Shudder is in postproduction on an adaptation of his 2014 short story ""By the Silver Water of Lake Champlain"" for its anthology series ""Creepshow,"" a reboot of the 1982 movie written by King -- which also starred Hill as a little boy. ""I feel like I've had a real lucky run,"" he said. ""But it's kind of a gold rush, right?"" Networks and streaming services were now ""vacuuming up books and comic books and short stories,"" he argued, which presented new opportunities for writers who worked with ""suspense and high concepts."" ""We'll see how long it lasts,"" he added. ""Probably until the environmental apocalypse finishes us all off.""

""NOS4A2"" traveled a comparatively straightforward path to TV. Published in 2013, the novel was an immediate best seller; by 2015, it had found its way to AMC, which has made horror a core part of its programming. ""The Walking Dead"" remains one of TV's most popular shows, and a spinoff, ""Fear the Walking Dead,"" begins its fifth season Sunday as the lead-in for ""NOS4A2."" This summer AMC will present a second season of its well-received anthology series ""The Terror,"" which brings supernatural horror to historical settings. Screen adaptations of sprawling stories are, of course, a tradition in Hill's family. Dozens of his father's stories have been adapted, many into classics, like ""Carrie,"" ""The Dead Zone"" and ""The Shawshank Redemption."" Others, like ""Maximum Overdrive"" and ""The Lawnmower Man"" ... weren't so classic. (AMC is also developing a pilot script based on ""Sleeping Beauties,"" a novel written by Stephen and Owen King, Hill's brother.) Hill said his father had offered some good advice about the vicissitudes of having one's work adapted, a process over which the writer often has little control once the rights are sold. ""He'd say, ' If someone takes one of my novels and makes a brilliant movie, it doesn't make my novel one word better ,'"" Hill said. The important thing, King told him, was to ""be working on the next book."" As valuable as it was to have the world's most famous living horror writer for a father, Hill was determined to succeed on his own merits. ""I knew by the time I was 12 that I really wanted to make stuff up for a living,"" he said. Still, he ""was deeply insecure"" about being taken seriously.

""I needed to feel like when I got published, I got published for the right reasons,"" he said. Hence the pseudonym, which Hill adopted in college -- a shortening of his full name, Joseph Hillstrom King. After early attempts to separate himself even further -- writing what he called ""New Yorker-type stories about divorce and difficult children and middle-age ennui"" -- he soon realized that the stories ""had no inner life."" Once he embraced the uncanny storytelling he had always loved, success soon followed, including several best-selling novels. (His identity was officially outed by Variety in 2006. ) ""NOS4A2,"" Hill's third novel, was an obvious fit for television, said David Madden, the president of programing for AMC's entertainment networks. Madden believed that recent years had seen a deepening interest in what he called ""immersive horror,"" with its longer arcs and detailed character building. ""I don't think you could have compressed it into an hour and 45 minutes and done it any version of justice,"" Madden said. (Hill's second novel, ""Horns,"" was made into a movie , released in 2014 to middling reviews.)

Compressing the story also let O'Brien confine Vic's portrayal to a single actress. Ashleigh Cummings (""Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries""), who plays Vic, said she had been drawn to the character in part because she relied on powers other than the traditionally masculine ones valued in most superheroines. It was important, she said, to ""broaden the scope of the term 'strength' to include qualities that have been typically attributed as female."" ""She does have the courage and bravery that you see in superheroine females, but her strongest muscle is actually her heart,"" Cummings said. ""And her superpowers are her creativity, her intuition, her empathy, her vulnerability."" It seemed important to Hill that his brand of horror should convey that depth of character, beyond the blood and guts. (Though the story has plenty of that, too.) Television was great for that, he noted, because a viewer could really fall in love with the characters over many weeks and months, and thus come to root for them. ""I think some people think horror is about sadism; it's about flinging intestines at the camera,"" he said. ""And some is. And I like some of that stuff. But I do think the really effective horror is about empathy.""","The AMC horror series is one of several adaptations the best-selling horror author (and son of Stephen King) has in the works, after multiple stalled attempts.",83159e41-d04a-516e-b071-866069b913bf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/01/arts/31joehill1/31joehill1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=4a83929116f5c1d0fe5223c07b6da0ab056437e9f2c30f1ff8dff7ee205d11fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;It&rsquo;s kind of a gold rush, right?&rdquo; Joe Hill said.

Movies,'Overseas' Review: Human Capital,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/movies/overseas-review.html,"In 2018, the Philippine president Rodrigo Duterte honored overseas Filipino workers -- the women deployed to Dubai, Singapore and other countries as domestic help -- as heroes for their hefty contribution to the country's economy. But in ""Overseas,"" an observational documentary set in a Philippine training center for such workers, the pupils question this designation. ""How can you be a hero when you just work abroad for your own family's future?"" one asks.

The exaltation of desperate survival as a moral virtue emerges as the central irony of Sung-a Yoon's wrenching film. The training center serves as a kind of microcosm. With its pastel-colored walls and labeled rooms (""bathroom,"" ""kitchen area""), it's the setting not just for cleaning and caregiving lessons but also role-play exercises that prepare the women for the abuses often meted out by their employers. The trainees commit to these harrowing scenarios with a disorienting sense of play -- wearing, for instance, a corny, painted-on mustache while playing the assailant in a sexual assault simulation.",This observational documentary is set in a training center for Filipino women who are deployed abroad to work as domestic help.,0f0c86f5-74c3-5aff-8691-390dd0ca0563,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/24/arts/overseas1/overseas1-facebookJumbo.jpg,"In the documentary ""Overseas,"" Filipino women are trained to work abroad.",0f0c86f5-74c3-5aff-8691-390dd0ca0563,N24News/imgs/0f0c86f5-74c3-5aff-8691-390dd0ca0563.jpg,5
Books,Charles Yu Wins National Book Award for 'Interior Chinatown',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/books/national-book-awards-winners.html,"[The Best Books of 2020: View our full list.] Charles Yu won the National Book Award for fiction on Wednesday for his mind-bending satire, ""Interior Chinatown,"" a sendup of Hollywood and Asian-American stereotypes. The novel, written in the form of a screenplay, features an aspiring actor named Willis Wu who confronts casual racism and the cruel hierarchies of the entertainment world in his quest to graduate from bit roles as the ""Delivery Guy"" or ""Silent Henchman."" The judges praised the novel as ""wonderfully inventive"" and ""by turns hilarious and flat out heartbreaking."" Mr. Yu, who was one of the National Book Foundation's Five Under 35 most promising writers in America in 2007, worked as a lawyer before he quit to pursue writing. ""Interior Chinatown"" is his fourth book. ""I can't feel anything in my body right now,"" a visibly stunned Mr. Yu said during his acceptance speech, adding that he was so certain he wouldn't win that he didn't prepare remarks and wondered aloud if he was in a simulation. ""I'm going to go melt into a puddle right now,"" he said.

It was a fittingly surreal speech for an unconventional award ceremony, at a tumultuous time when reality has often has felt stranger than fiction. In normal times, the National Book Awards ceremony is a lavish, black-tie affair held at Cipriani Wall Street, with a ceremony that draws the most powerful people in publishing and a constellation of literary stars. This year, as with so many cultural events that were scrambled as a result of the pandemic, the ceremony was held online, streamed on YouTube and the foundation's website. The mood this year was still upbeat, even virtually, as a much larger digital audience joined the celebration, which typically draws around 700 people in person.

""It's hard in a pandemic,"" Lisa Lucas, the executive director of the National Book Foundation, said in a video address. ""We were scared we wouldn't be able to do this show, and here we are."" The nonfiction award went to ""The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X,"" a deeply researched biography by Les Payne and his daughter Tamara Payne. In an emotional acceptance speech, Ms. Payne, who researched the book alongside her father and finished it after his death in 2018, thanked him ""for committing to this enormous work"" and ""for bringing me on as his co-pilot.""

The awards, now in their 71st year, were hosted by Jason Reynolds, a best-selling children's book author and two-time National Book Award finalist. The National Book Award, which dates back to 1950, is one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the world and has been given to literary icons like W.H. Auden, Saul Bellow, Ralph Ellison, William Faulkner and Flannery O'Connor. This year's awards ceremony, which took place as the coronavirus pandemic continues to surge across the world, provided more than a moment of levity for the literary world. For struggling authors and booksellers, who have seen their sales plummet this year, literary prizes like the National Book Awards and Booker Prize can draw much-needed attention to titles that have been overlooked. While brand-name authors and large publishing companies have seen healthy sales this year -- print sales are up by seven percent this year over 2019 -- many smaller, independent publishing houses and lesser-known writers have struggled, as universities and bookstores across the United States have closed, cutting off vital avenues for reaching readers. More than half of the finalists this year were released by independent publishers and academic presses. Eight of the 25 finalists were debuts. Some of the speakers alluded to the tense political climate in the aftermath of the election, the ongoing struggle for racial equality and the devastation of the pandemic. The writer Roxane Gay, who presented this year's fiction award, spoke about the responsibility of fiction writers to grapple with the challenging times we are living in.

The prize for translated literature went to Yu Miri's novel ""Tokyo Ueno Station,"" which was translated from Japanese by Morgan Giles, and is narrated by a ghost who visits a park where he lived when he was homeless. The award for translated literature -- a category that was added in 2018 -- this year included works written in Arabic, Spanish, German and Swedish. They were Pilar Quintana's ""The Bitch,"" about a Colombian woman's relationship with an orphaned puppy; ""High as the Waters Rise,"" a debut novel about an oil rig worker by the German poet Anja Kampmann; Adania Shibli's ""Minor Detail,"" which centers on a woman in Ramallah who decides to investigate the decades-old murder of a Palestinian teenager; and Jonas Hassen Khemiri's novel, ""The Family Clause,"" about a painful family reunion in Stockholm.","The nonfiction prize went to Les Payne and Tamara Payne for ""The Dead Are Arising: The Life of Malcolm X.""

Opinion,The World We Once Lived in Has Vanished,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/opinion/coronavirus-life.html,"Looking back, it's hard to remember the exact moment we left the old world behind, and entered this new one. How did Ernest Hemingway describe going bankrupt -- ""gradually, and then suddenly""? Like that. Was it last month, when the trip to Italy I'd booked with my wife was canceled? ""Just to be on the safe side,"" my hosts told me at the time. Or was it three weeks ago, when I first noticed that hand sanitizer at my local pharmacy was sold out? Was it a week ago Sunday, when I got the message from Barnard College's president that classes for the coming week would be held via videoconference?

Or was it the next day, when the Dow Jones industrial average plunged more than 2000 points? Maybe it was last Wednesday night, when President Trump delivered a wooden speech, condemning the ""foreign virus""? (Even when he's talking about disease, he has to sneak a little racism in.) Or two days later, when in response to a question about the lack of widespread access to testing, the leader of the free world said, ""I don't take responsibility at all."" Each of these events captured a moment when it became clear the crisis -- both pandemical and political -- was getting worse, day by day. But the moment that will always remain in my mind is Monday, March 9, as I rode the subway north. The doors opened and closed at Chambers Street. Then a deranged man started yelling about the coronavirus, and the gay men he claimed were spreading it. He shouted profanities. And no, the phrase he used was not ""gay men."" At the next stop, almost everyone in the car fled. Then it was just two of us, the crazy man and me. He looked me up, he looked me down. I don't know what he saw when he looked at me. A frightened older woman? Something else? I remembered riding the subway in the early '80s, and the panic over AIDS, my terror as friends got sick. I remembered how President Ronald Reagan had been unable to bring himself to even say ""AIDS"" until four years after the disease had been identified. I remembered the news conference when a reporter first asked about the condition, and the president's press secretary, Larry Speakes, responded with a gay joke. Journalists laughed. Because it was so funny! Gay people dying! What a hoot!

All at once I was in my twenties again, and the feeling of panic rising in my heart felt strangely, eerily familiar. I teach at Barnard College in the spring semester each year. The rest of the time I live in a small town in Maine. I miss my family, and my dog, and my friends while I'm working in New York, but on the whole, being part of the college has been one of the great blessings of my life. Gradually -- and then suddenly -- it became clear to me that, as I packed my bags for spring break last week, I might not be coming back to New York when break was over. I looked around my apartment. I'd been here for nine weeks. Was it really possible I might not return until next January? Will it be safe to come back here then? That night, I noticed I had the sniffles. I coughed. There was a time when I'd have paid this no mind. Now, I felt my heart pounding. Was I infected? I took my temperature. It was normal. But for how long? When I was a child, I was haunted by the idea that I'd die in the year 2020. I don't know how this delusion first came to me, but I remember thinking of it at least as early as 1968, when I was only 10 years old. I've thought of writing about it in my column this year -- and about the way all sorts of things only come true when we take deliberate steps to prevent them. But I've demurred, thinking such dark thoughts are best left unspoken. On Thursday night I sat up in bed, suddenly remembering my childhood certainty about the year 2020. It's coming for you, I thought. Now is when it comes.

I woke in the morning, symptom free, but still in the grip of other afflictions -- those of fear, and emptiness, and panic. On Friday I walked up Amsterdam Avenue and saw an image spray-painted on the sidewalk. ""PROTECT YO' HEART,"" it read, along with a picture of a heart upside down. Later, I learned it was the work of an artist from Queens named Uncutt Art. It reminded me of how important it is to care for our spiritual selves during a time of crisis. The Protect Yo' Heart project, I learned, took its name from Proverbs 4:23: ""Above all else, guard your heart, for everything you do flows from it."" The world we lived in has vanished -- slowly, and then suddenly.  Maybe, in this new one, we will better understand that in a moment of national crisis, you need someone who can bring people together. Someone who trusts facts, and science, and truth. Someone who can express empathy for others' suffering. Someone who can lead. Maybe, in this new one, we will better understand just how much we need each other, now that being together in one room has become so hard. I'm back in Maine now. I don't know for how long. Wash your hands. Protect yo' heart. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

Technology,"As Qualcomm Deal Is Scrapped, China Denies Trade Link",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/26/technology/qualcomm-china-trade-war.html,"Delays in China that led Qualcomm to call off its acquisition of a rival microchip maker had nothing to do with escalating trade tensions with the United States, a spokesman for the Chinese Commerce Ministry said on Thursday.

Qualcomm and NXP Semiconductors first announced their $44 billion union nearly two years ago. Qualcomm is based in San Diego and NXP in the Netherlands, but both do significant business in China, which is why its antimonopoly authorities had say over whether the deal would go through.

But as frictions between the United States and China intensified this year, Beijing's prolonged antitrust review came to be seen as a form of leverage over the negotiations. The Trump administration imposed tariffs on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods this month, and Beijing immediately retaliated with levies of its own.

Chinese regulators never formally rejected the deal, which had been approved by eight other jurisdictions, including the United States. But Beijing dragged its review out to more than 20 months.","As frictions intensified this year, Beijing's prolonged antitrust review of the NXP purchase came to be seen as a form of leverage over negotiations.",d48e8734-04c4-5696-8202-23e3c6345542,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/27/world/27china-qcom-1/27china-qcom-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=00c1bb2dc4ba9b636442bbdb9ba5dab2506454846a8bbdcbdd4861db25010423&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Gao Feng of the Chinese Commerce Ministry during a news conference in Beijing in April.,d48e8734-04c4-5696-8202-23e3c6345542,N24News/imgs/d48e8734-04c4-5696-8202-23e3c6345542.jpg,20
Travel,"On a New York Underground Railroad Tour, Lessons in Resistance",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/24/travel/new-york-city-underground-railroad-tour-slavery.html,"On a brutally cold Saturday in January, my family and I are on the stairs of the National Museum of the American Indian, waiting to begin a NYC Slavery and the Underground Railroad Tour that covers the financial district. We are the only brown people in the 12-person group, and I am giving Sean O'Brien, our white tour guide, a long side eye. After all, this is a tour of the Underground Railroad. Shouldn't the guide, like the people who moved toward freedom, carry some African DNA? I'm beyond skeptical. My children, at 8 and 14, are glowering. Just an hour earlier, my partner and I wrangled them from the warmth of their rooms and the sweet oblivion of their rerun streams of '90s sitcoms to this moment. The youngest yelled from upstairs, ""This is something you guys care about, not us!"" And he was right. Why would they want to spend a morning walking the freezing streets of Lower Manhattan? And if I weren't a mom, I might have said this, and the tour would have been over before it began. But I am a mom so instead, I yelled back up, ""You wouldn't be here now if your ancestors had whined about not wanting to go!"" The truth is, none of us really wanted to go. Easier (and warmer) to stay home and reread Colson Whitehead's phenomenal ""The Underground Railroad"" or watch the remake of ""Roots."" Or even better, stream ""black-ish"" and have a few laughs while paying homage to our past. But, like our ancestors, we are not living in an easy time. Some of their tools, foresight and resistance are already very much needed. ""Be down in 15 minutes or every device will be taken away for a week.""

Still, we arrive 10 minutes late for a tour that asks everyone to be 15 minutes early. In my 20s and early 30s, when writing was still the sideline thing I hoped to one day not be so sideline, I walked the Lower Manhattan streets to my job as a word-processing temp. It was awful work that brought me each weekday morning either to the World Trade Center or to Wall Street to be ordered about by mergers-and-acquisitions bankers working for companies that no longer exist -- Bankers Trust, Prudential-Bache, Manufacturers Hanover.

As I walked along Pearl Street then, I had no idea that Fraunces Tavern had been owned by Samuel Fraunces, a man whose true racial identity continues to be in question -- many believe he was of mixed race and passing as white. There are white folks who vehemently disagree. During the Revolutionary War, he was referred to as ""Black Sam"" and Fraunces Tavern was called Black Sam's. Hmm ... Fraunces also served as a steward to George Washington. As Sean drops this bit of knowledge, my children perk up -- having seen Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""Hamilton,"" they consider themselves scholars on the subject of our founding father. Suddenly this tour is relevant. Across from the tavern stands the spot of the first presidential mansion (demolished in 1856) where Samuel Fraunces managed the presidential staff. For me, New York is a city that is continually unlocking new doors -- the tour is one that is at once devastating and amazingly empowering. When Sean stops our small group at Philipse Well on Pearl Street, we stand around it, staring down as he explains how this cistern exists on what was once the Philipse family's property and was a place where enslaved people were allowed to gather and engage with one another as they drew water. Any other gathering among more than three enslaved people was against the law. I had grown up believing New York to be a free state, but being one of the early free states and being a truly free state were very different.

I learn that under British rule, enslaved people were treated worse than any other group of enslaved people in history. I watch my children watching Sean, who I have now decided is nothing short of exceptional, discuss the complexities of race, the importance of gathering, the genius and resilience of enslaved people. The group stares down into the well for a few somber moments, then moves on. At the intersection of Water and Wall Streets, we come to the place where one of the biggest markets in the world once stood -- New York City's first slave market. Standing beside a plaque memorializing the spot, we get a brief (and as child-friendly as possible) history of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, from the late 16th century to the early 19th century. We hear more about the triangular trading system that carried enslaved people, manufactured goods and cash crops between West Africa, the Caribbean, America, Europe and the British colonies, learning how the enslavement of African people was part of the world's economy. In an attempt to make a life-to-text connection, I whisper to my daughter that she read about this in Ta-Nehisi Coates's ""Between the World and Me."" Radio silence and eyeroll -- which mean I'm getting through to her. Throughout the tour, Sean counters the brutality and inhumanity of enslavement with information about the constant uprisings and opposition. Because this is a tour company that also provides educational tours to school groups, Sean's clarity engages my son, who by this point is walking beside him. We move on to 5 Broad Street where we stand in front of the former location of Downing's Oyster House, where Thomas Downing, the son of freed slaves, catered to aristocracy in his lush restaurant, while his son, George, helped hide runaway slaves en route north in the basement.

Then Sean lets us know that while Alexander Hamilton was a man of manumissions who had a complicated history with slavery, the family of his wife, Eliza, were slaveholders. The disappointment in Eliza is clear on the faces of both children. In ""Hamilton,"" she is beloved, a hero. But on the tour, by my children, not so much anymore. There is something else going on. I watch my children beginning to understand the complexity of the city they've always known and loved deeply. They are coming to know that the history of their New York speaks to an even deeper history of their country, and to the fact that only a few subway stops away from our Brooklyn home, we can walk the same streets our ancestors walked -- freely. From the slave revolts of 1712 and 1741 to the notorious ""Bonfires of the Negroes"" (where enslaved people, rumored to be planning an uprising, were publicly burned) at Foley Square to David Ruggles's rescue of Frederick Douglass to the Draft Riots of 1863, this tour was nothing short of amazing. So amazing, that a few days later I tried to track Sean down to thank him. My message landed in the hands of the owner of Inside Out Tours, Stacey Toussaint, a young mom, a graduate of Packer Collegiate Institute and of Columbia Law, the daughter of Haitian immigrants.

Ms. Toussaint began the company with her friend, Sheila Collins. The plan was to give socially responsible and thoughtful tours of this great and complicated city. Her wealth of knowledge, her cleareyed approach, her stories and passion and honest commitment to African-American history reminded me of some of my best teachers in high school -- the ones who made me laugh while learning, the ones who made me hungry for more. I saw this in the faces of my children. As Sean told the story of Ellen Craft, a light-skinned enslaved woman who escaped with her husband, William Craft, into freedom by passing as a white man and posing as his master, I saw my daughter smile -- a smile that spoke to the pride of coming to this moment through a history of resistance. ""Sankofa"" is a Twi word from the Akan tribe in Ghana. The translation is ""go back and take what is at risk of being left behind."" As my partner and I endeavor to raise thoughtful and engaged children, we know a deep knowledge of this country's past will help them not only survive this moment but realize a future beyond it. The history of New York's Underground Railroad -- the financial and physical ramifications of enslavement here, the streets we walk on every day and the bodies that built them -- is a narrative we all need to know as we move toward this country's future. When I asked my children what they thought of the tour, both said, ""It was good."" Which is teen and 'tween for, ""It was really good."" As a person of color, as a woman, as a body moving through this particular space in time, I realize the streets of New York tell the story of resistance, an African-American history of brilliance and beauty, that even in its most brutal moments, did not, could not, kill our resilient and powerful spirit.",A tour in Lower Manhattan on a cold winter day is a somber and empowering course in the history of slavery — and the fight against it.,86aaec8a-235f-550f-8195-84df4c130582,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/26/travel/26NEWYORKCITY/26NEWYORKCITY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=ac47c2717cc6af7a3b7feb202dd88e84d53072680b32e76d2807cf288004fa2c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fraunces Tavern, at the corner of Pearl and Broad Street, was owned by Samuel Fraunces, a steward to George Washington.",86aaec8a-235f-550f-8195-84df4c130582,N24News/imgs/86aaec8a-235f-550f-8195-84df4c130582.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,Facing Impossible Obstacles Together,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/18/fashion/weddings/facing-impossible-obstacles-together.html,"On Oct. 27, 2018, Dillon Dreher, a welder's assistant from Greeley, Colo., was working with a crew at an oil field near rural Briggsdale, Colo., when a power tool he was using threw off sparks, causing a massive oil tank to erupt in flames. He was airlifted to North Colorado Medical Center with burns over 65 percent of his body. The last thing he remembers before losing consciousness in the helicopter was reciting the phone number of his girlfriend, Derae Caro, to a Flight for Life emergency worker. They had gotten into a fight that morning and he wanted her to know he was sorry. ""Saturday was normally my day off, and Derae wanted me to stay home and hang out with her and Lilly,"" he said; Lilly is Ms. Caro's 5-year-old daughter. But Mr. Dreher had gone to work because he couldn't let the idea of an extra paycheck go. Christmas was coming, and he had his sights set on playing Santa. ""I was working all the overtime I could, because I had it in my mind that Lilly was going to wake up on Christmas morning and there would be this avalanche of toys,"" he said.

Mr. Dreher, 25, met Ms. Caro, also 25, in 2007, when both were at Heath Middle School in Greeley. ""We hung out around school and would write notes and stuff,"" he said. She was his first kiss. By high school, both had moved on. Then, in 2016, two years after Mr. Dreher graduated from Northridge High and Ms. Caro had earned her high school equivalency diploma, he stumbled across her on Snapchat. ""I added her, I guess because I remembered that she was always fun to be around and she's pretty,"" he said. Ms. Caro, unemployed, a new mother and recovering from a relationship she described as abusive, wasn't feeling much like her fun sixth-grade self. ""I was in a very, very dark place,"" she said. Mr. Dreher's decision to reach out to Ms. Caro momentarily returned her to the innocence of adolescence. On Feb. 6, 2016 -- both remember it was the day before the Broncos won the Super Bowl -- she agreed to meet him for a reunion at the local Rio Grande Mexican Restaurant.

""We instantly caught up on everything,"" Ms. Caro said. ""We didn't want to stop talking or leave each other's side."" Within two weeks, Ms. Caro and Lilly, then 8 months old, moved into the Greeley condominium that Mr. Dreher was sharing with his older sister, Danielle, and her boyfriend. One month in, they found their own apartment in nearby Loveland. ""From the first time we hung out, he made me feel like a diamond,"" she said. ""He opened doors for me. He was my knight in shining armor."" Mr. Dreher's gallantry was especially on display with Lilly. ""She took my breath away,"" he said. ""I had never held a baby before."" By the time of the accident, Lilly was calling Mr. Dreher Daddy and Mr. Dreher was introducing her as his daughter. And then, in the space of a fiery moment, Ms. Caro had cause to worry they might never refer to each other that way again. ""I still get anxiety every time I hear a helicopter,"" Ms. Caro said. Mr. Dreher can no longer tolerate being woken up in a hurry. ""I get scared,"" he said, because it brings back the blurry aftermath of the explosion. ""I remember someone shaking the hell out of me, and then I remember getting up. I don't remember if my shoes were on, and I don't remember walking to the helicopter. I remember looking at my shirt and seeing it was real tattered up. After that it was all just bad dreams.""

""For the first few weeks I kept asking, 'When are we going to know if he's going to make it?'"" Ms. Caro said. ""But they wouldn't tell us. They would just say, 'We have to see how his body handles it.'"" When Mr. Dreher's kidneys failed, she crumbled. When they came back, she leaned into her last shreds of hope. ""I was like, Dillon's a fighter. He's in there somewhere fighting."" Whether he was fighting for a return to her and Lilly, though, she wasn't sure, even though she turned up evidence of his devotion while he was in the coma. Two days after the oil field accident, the company Mr. Dreher was working for, Mallard Exploration, returned his phone to Ms. Caro. ""It was cracked and I wasn't sure it would work, but it turned on,"" she said. She started scrolling through texts and found an exchange with Mr. Dreher's best friend, Jayce Montoya, from the day of the explosion. Mr. Dreher had already given Ms. Caro a promise ring. The texts were about a next step: buying an engagement ring from Kay Jewelers, where Mr. Montoya worked.

At first, he didn't. He thought she was a nurse. He recognized his parents, Terry and Ronda Dreher of Greeley, but had misconceptions about them. ""I must have had some delusion in my dreams, because I was thinking it was their fault I was in the hospital, like they wouldn't let me leave. It really confused them."" Lilly had been asking for him since the accident. ""She was sad and confused, and she was spending a lot of time with my mom and grandparents because I was always at the hospital,"" Ms. Caro said. Just after he emerged from the coma, they arranged a visit. ""They wheeled him out of the burn unit, and he was able to hold her."" By then, the mental fog of the coma was dissipating, and Mr. Dreher was after what he called ""a sense of normal."" ""I just wanted to see Lilly or Derae,"" he said. He still couldn't walk or talk. He credits the reunion with his daughter with his will to recover.

""Lilly would comfort me sometimes,"" he said. ""I'd be sitting there crying, and she'd come up and give me a hug."" There were other bright moments. On Feb. 23, he re-proposed to Ms. Caro, this time formally, and she said a tearful yes. But by May, depression got the better of him. He broke up with Ms. Caro and moved in with his parents in Greeley. Ms. Caro was devastated a second time. ""I could kind of feel that things weren't going super great, and I knew he wasn't mentally stable,"" she said. ""He was saying stuff like he wished he didn't live through the accident. It was heartbreaking. I was questioning whether I could have done something differently. And Lilly thought she had lost her Daddy a second time."" In August, Mr. Dreher's depression showed signs of lifting. With help from a therapist he still sees, ""I realized I had to accept what I was going through, and all that life had thrown at me,"" he said. ""I also knew that Derae deserved the best, and I wanted to always be there for her and Lilly."" By the end of that month, he had moved back in with Ms. Caro and Lilly and they set a new wedding date of May 8, 2020.

Final Invites Ms. Caro walked down the aisle with her mother, Sarah Bordeaux, of Greeley. Ms. Bordeaux said she was relieved the wedding finally happened. ""This was the third time we sent out invitations,"" she said. Finally, Forever Pink flowers and accents brightened the indoor wedding. Before guests were served a roast beef dinner followed by marble wedding cake, Ms. Caro and Mr. Dreher were presented as husband and wife from an indoor balcony. Onward Mr. Dreher is still being treated for his burns. He undergoes Z-plasty treatments, a form of plastic surgery, on a near monthly basis. ""Every surgery I get feels like three steps forward,"" he said. He hopes to be cleared to work again in a year.

Travel,"Basking in the Sun This Winter, for Less",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/travel/09frugal-islands-budget-travel-tips.html,"Birds fly south for the winter, and why shouldn't you? With the approaching cold weather, it's time to fire up the laptop and start planning that much-deserved vacation. Whether you're single or coupled up, traveling solo or with children in tow, everyone has more or less the same goal: Escape to some temporary warmth while maximizing enjoyment and minimizing cost. Here are a few tips I've compiled for those seeking sun this coming winter, be it on a cruise ship or a quick getaway to a tropical island. Don't know your Celebrity from your Carnival? Can't tell your Queen Mary 2 from your Symphony of the Seas? Newcomers might find the message boards on the Cruise Critic website useful: It's an opinionated, active community of cruise enthusiasts and many answers to basic questions (everything from packing logistics to passport concerns) can be found within the various conversation threads. There is also a dedicated section that features thousands of reviews written by first-time cruise participants, with subsections for things like luxury or river cruises. As with anything online, user reviews should be taken with a grain of salt -- but for those who aren't quite sure where to begin, this is a good place to consult. I searched for a seven-night Holland America cruise departing from Tampa, Fla., for two adults and two children and was quoted a total of $1,546 on the Holland America website. A quick search on a different site, Cruise.com, yielded the exact same price, $1,546.

A search for a four-night Bahamas cruise for two adults leaving Port Canaveral in January resulted in a total price of $724.68, booking directly through the Royal Caribbean website. Over on Priceline, that same cruise was on sale for the same amount, to the penny -- $724.68. On the Costco Travel site, the price was $724.68. Out of curiosity, I checked one more site. On Expedia, that same cruise came out to a total of, you guessed it, $724.68. The lesson? Shopping around doesn't always get you a better deal. Instead, look for small ways to get ahead. Expedia and Priceline, for example, both offer varying amounts of onboard bonus spending -- good for things like spa treatments and incidentals -- depending on how expensive your cabin is.

If you're going on a cruise, there's a decent chance you'll want to enjoy a drink or two during your vacation. And the cruise companies, of course, are banking on you spending plenty of money on their alcohol. Every cruise line has a different policy, though, so read up carefully beforehand so that you can maximize what's allowable. Royal Caribbean, for example, allows guests to bring two 750-milliliter bottles of wine or champagne per room. Guests can also bring up to 12 17-ounce cans or bottles of nonalcoholic beverages. Bringing a few waters and sodas will help offset the pain of the $13-per-day soda packages being rolled out in 2019.

The beverages policy at Norwegian Cruise Line, however, is different. Guests may not bring any nonalcoholic beverages aboard, not even water, unless it's for a medical reason or mixing infant formula. Guests may, however, bring bottles of wine and champagne aboard, provided they pay a corkage fee ($15 per 750 milliliter bottle). Residents of some states get discounts Some cruise companies offer what's known as a resident rate -- a discount to residents of certain U.S. states. The rates vary, so it's good to call and ask exactly which states receive a discount. When I checked out a five-night Carnival Bahamas cruise on the website Cruise Sheet leaving from Charleston, S.C., in January, I noticed that New York residents received a slight discount ($310 per person, per night instead of $328). Sometimes it's the residents of the state that the ship is departing from who get the discount, but residents from other states can be included, too. None of us wants more email, but it can be the best way to stay in the loop about sales and last-minute deals. Once you've set your sights on one or two cruise companies, sign up for their emails to monitor prices and find out when there's a deal.

Use those points and miles There's no sense in having credit card points, hotel points and airline miles if you're not going to use them. And that trove you've amassed is the perfect thing to take the edge off the cost of your vacation -- or in some cases, pay for it entirely. A three-night stay in late December at Parador Guanica, a boutique hotel built in 1929 on the southern coast of Puerto Rico, is $295 (double occupancy), booked through the Chase travel portal. But remember: holders of the Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card can redeem travel at 1.5 cents per point -- or in this case, about 19,700 for the entire stay. Currently, the cheapest advertised flight from New York to Honolulu, leaving Dec. 26 and returning Dec. 30, will cost you a cool $1,350 -- a pretty expensive ticket. But the points cost of the flight, just a hair under 90,000, while still not cheap, is somewhat easier to stomach.

The American Express travel portal offers the benefit of booking travel packages, but doesn't offer as good value for points redemption. A five-night trip from Boston to St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands, departing just before New Year's, is valued at $1,290 per person when booked as part of a package with the budget guesthouse Sunset Gardens -- a saving of several hundred dollars compared to booking the flight and hotel individually. But the points cost, about 184,000 Membership Rewards points per person, represents a value of only 0.7 cents per point -- less than half the value than in the above-mentioned examples in the Chase portal. Still, if you're sitting on a big pile of American Express points, it's an option to consider. Think beyond the brand-name hotel The major hotel brands offer a certain amount of reliability, but they're also limiting. In Nassau, the Bahamas, a weeklong stay beginning in late December will run you $400 per night at the British Colonial Hilton Nassau. At the slightly less luxurious Courtyard by Marriott Nassau Downtown, you'll still pay $270 per night. Consider heading north of New Providence to Great Abaco Island (there are nonstop flights from Miami and Atlanta, among other cities), where there's nary a Marriott nor Hilton to be found. A quick search on the site VRBO (Vacation Rentals by Owner) yielded a rental condo right on the beach for just $128 per night. Don't count on daily housekeeping, but you might enjoy a more intimate, local experience. Looking for some travel bragging rights? You might be interested in United Airlines Flight 154, colloquially known as the Island Hopper, a flight that bounces between seldom-visited islands in the Pacific while heading from Honolulu to Guam. Making five stops at various locales in the Marshall Islands and Micronesia, with only brief stopovers, it's an interesting (and, at 14-plus hours, somewhat lengthy) opportunity to see what few casual travelers have. For aviation enthusiasts, the point of the Island Hopper is the flight itself, and it is a popular bucket-list item. A trip in the beginning of January will cost over $1,300, however. But if you've got some United miles lying around, you can make the trip for just 27,500 miles. You can combine it with the airline's Excursionist Perk, which allows for a free one-way award flight within one region when you book a valid round-trip or multicity trip that begins and ends in a different region (browse what qualifies as a ""region"" on United before you book). With a little work , you can carve out a one-of-a-kind trip. If you're feeling adventurous and have a certain amount of flexibility, the website Cheapcaribbean.com offers something called Deal of Fortune -- discounted stays in resorts for, the site claims, as much as 65 percent less than you'd normally spend. You select when and where you fly from as well as the length of your trip and general area where you want to stay -- Los Cabos in Mexico, for example, or Punta Cana in the Dominican Republic. But your exact lodgings are a mystery at the time of booking. Within seven days of your departure, you'll be notified of your resort. I would advise reading all fine print before purchasing, as well as doing some online research. TripAdvisor has several forum threads that discuss experiences with these mystery deals. While the thrill of possibly getting a great deal on a vacation can certainly be exciting, it's best to go into any overseas travel situation with as much information as possible.","Tips and strategies for singles and families who want to enjoy warm weather on a sandy beach or on the deck of a cruise ship, and still not pay too much.",67066d21-2902-56ab-9a25-dc7ebe62560e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/09/travel/09frugal3/09frugal3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7b4476c90120c8bc6a149dee182ae38a5267c961b43d35db063ffdabfef94a7e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The yoga class at Sivananda Ashram Yoga Retreat overlooking Paradise Beach on Paradise Island.,67066d21-2902-56ab-9a25-dc7ebe62560e,N24News/imgs/67066d21-2902-56ab-9a25-dc7ebe62560e.jpg,4
Music,Opera Lives in Cycles,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/arts/music/licht-stockhausen-wagner-opera.html,"AMSTERDAM -- When Friedrich Nietzsche turned his pen on his onetime friend, Richard Wagner, his overarching critique was that grandeur shouldn't be mistaken for depth. He worried about the marketplace consequences of blockbusters blotting out substance, not unlike today's film reviewers warily watching the latest Avengers movie. Yet opera does live on bigness, which means that it has lived on cycles. And with his ""Ring"" tetralogy, Wagner threw down a gauntlet. Since then, thinking in multi-opera arcs, and seeing an operatic project in multiple works, has been core to the modern conception of the art form: Think Puccini's ""Il Trittico"" or Philip Glass's trio of great-men ""portrait"" operas, ""Einstein on the Beach,"" ""Satyagraha"" and ""Akhnaten."" The trilogy that Robert Ashley wrote beginning with ""Atalanta"" even ends within a separate tetralogy, ""Now Eleanor's Idea"" -- nesting dolls of cycles. I thought a lot about grandeur and depth over the past few weeks, as I took in Wagner's ""Ring"" at the Metropolitan Opera then caught a glimpse of another, even more gargantuan cycle -- Karlheinz Stockhausen's seven-opera ""Licht"" -- as staged by Pierre Audi in three days of excerpts at the Holland Festival. It was a move from Wagner's traditional, if sprawling narrative structure to something far more ambiguous.

The first opera in the original cycle, ""Donnerstag aus Licht,"" actually begins with strong narrative drive. It's seemingly autobiographical, with the wisdom-seeking character of Michael a stand-in for Stockhausen. Character (like creator) suffers through childhood trauma in World War II-era Germany, gains postwar admission to a conservatory, and embarks on a worldwide career in music. The next two operas focus on the cycle's other primary figures -- Lucifer, the independent-minded fallen angel, and Eve, a maternal figure and instructor in love. Over the subsequent operas, these characters fight and collaborate, by turns. By ""Sonntag aus Licht,"" the final opera, Lucifer is virtually absent, and the union of Michael and Eve has a multicultural tinge -- with tributes to concepts of love and communion voiced in a wealth of languages. And yet this happy, even utopian, conclusion doesn't resolve troubling elements from the other operas -- the race-based children's war in ""Freitag aus Licht,"" for example. Those troubles merely seem to evaporate, without being forgotten. The specter of violence is still there. And if quasi-divine characters like Michael and Eve can't break the cycle of carnage -- as Brunnhilde does at the end of Wagner's ""Ring"" -- what hope does humanity have? A break from logic starts to look like the only escape available in the middle of the 20th century, with Romantic notions of deliverance thoroughly discredited. So what can fill the void? Stockhausen's music.

In an interview, Kathinka Pasveer, one of Stockhausen's partners and collaborators, and the musical director of ""Aus Licht,"" said that for him, ""more and more, the music became the most important thing."" ""'Donnerstag' was his first opera, so perhaps he also had the feeling he should write an opera with a story,"" she said. ""And then you feel as of 'Samstag,' already there is no real story. You have to find your clues yourself. You have to find your thread: 'What does it mean?'"" Even some more textually inclined composers of opera cycles have toyed with abstraction. In ""Now Eleanor's Idea,"" the title opera from Ashley's cycle-within-a-cycle, a bank teller central to the intrigue in a previous opera starts a new career as a newscaster; the second act is her broadcast on lowrider car culture. Even if you know that each opera of the tetralogy is intended as an allegory ""for an individual's self-realization within the context of a major religion found in the United States,"" you have to do a little interpretive work to keep your own understanding afloat.

That comfort with conceptual mystery as an organizing element has also had a strong influence on the American composer-saxophonist Anthony Braxton and his ""Trillium"" series of operas. When I interviewed Mr. Braxton earlier this year, he referred to Stockhausen as a hero, while also expressing his affection for Wagner. (By contrast, Ms. Pasveer said that the music of Wagner made Stockhausen ""sick"" -- and that they once had to leave a performance of ""Die Walkure,"" after only 20 minutes.) Mr. Braxton has said, of the ""Trillium"" series, still in progress, that while each act has an ""apparent story,"" ""nothing is as it appears."" So while the apparent story of an act in a ""Trillium"" opera might be about, for example, vacationers discovering a lamp with genie, the subtext could have to do with the reduced cultural capacities for imagination. (The vacationers pester the genie for catalogs to order from, instead of coming up with their own original wishes.) While ""Trillium"" is more politically earthbound than ""Licht"" -- even when it travels into space -- the listener is similarly charged with the responsibility to make connections, to create an individual meditation.

Like Stockhausen, Mr. Braxton also thinks about his music in modular terms. A vocal part from ""Trillium"" might turn up as fodder for one of Mr. Braxton's improvising trios, or in performances of his other pieces for voice. And in Amsterdam, there was a compelling window onto Stockhausen's method of building up his music dramas through compositional layering. An electronic work for voices, ""Invisible Choirs,"" was occasionally audible during the first act of ""Donnerstag."" After the night's live performance was over, ""Invisible Choirs"" was played again, this time blasted over the venue's surround sound system, as a stand-alone composition. When the work's mass of voices pulsed across the auditorium, a sense of Stockhausen's stated interest in the fate of humankind -- not just his own story -- was made excitingly concrete. This abstract but moving sense of depth came from a closer examination of the opera's music, as opposed to whether it was telling a traditional tale. By moving away from the overarching narrative flow of the ""Ring,"" these more recent cycles may be reflecting the fact that the epic scope that was once opera's trademark has been overtaken by the Marvel Cinematic Universe and ""Game of Thrones."" But even if opera cycles have grown more enigmatic, mad creative ambition still reigns in them. Stockhausen may have taken leave from writing a straightforward tale as he worked on ""Licht,"" but he didn't fall off a creative cliff.

The bankruptcy, which in recent weeks had been the subject of speculation in the music world and on Wall Street, brings to an end a painful stretch for SFX and Mr. Sillerman, who hoped to repeat the success he had two decades ago with an earlier incarnation of SFX Entertainment. In that company, he combined concert promoters around the country and in 2000 sold the enterprise to the broadcaster Clear Channel -- now known as iHeartMedia -- for $4.4 billion. That network of promoters and theaters remains the basis of Live Nation Entertainment's concert division.

But the new version of SFX has been much more troubled. The company raised $260 million in an initial public offering in late 2013, but investors grew impatient with its efforts to build a profitable business by attracting corporate sponsors. Events like a Las Vegas edition of the Brazilian festival Rock in Rio also had disappointing results.

""Nothing ever materialized in the fundamentals with this company,"" said Steven Azarbad of Maglan Capital, a hedge fund that sold its holdings in SFX last year. ""It became a 'show me' story at some point.""

Last year, Mr. Sillerman offered to take the company private at $5.25 a share, valuing the company at $774 million, including its debt. But investors doubted that Mr. Sillerman had lined up the proper financing, and the company's shares began to plunge. By August, Mr. Sillerman abandoned his bid, and problems continued to mount through the fall. Last month the company disclosed that it was in default because it had failed to make a $3 million payment on a $10.8 million promissory note.","The reorganization will take the company private, eliminate more than $300 million in debt and install a new chief executive to replace Robert F.X. Sillerman.",55107ab6-df69-5b7d-90eb-e9cbca067888,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/02/business/02sfx-web/02sfx-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=5e3cfd2fc11f7ab81d87e6bd0a98531475bf305c5222a796c2f39a86c26debfb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"SFX Entertainment's Electric Zoo music festival last September in New York.

Real Estate,Making a Big Impact on a Small Budget,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/05/realestate/making-a-big-impact-on-a-small-budget.html,"When it comes to decor, money isn't everything. To create a stylish room, all you really need is imagination and the patience to find the right piece.

When you're designing a home, it's easy to get carried away dreaming about pricey sofas, rugs and art. But big-ticket items aren't as important as they seem, and plunking down the money to buy them is no guarantee you'll end up with a home you love. Often it's the small touches that make a space feel truly inviting and memorable. ""Style is in the mix of things,"" said Cliff Fong, founder of the Los Angeles interior design firm Matt Blacke. ""It doesn't take any imagination, or any level of taste, to go to a big-box store or an Italian design store and buy everything. That just takes deep pockets."" If you're willing to take your time -- hunting for special yet affordable pieces and doing the work yourself -- he said, ""There's a way to approach design at any budget."" To help, we asked Mr. Fong and other interior designers for ideas about how to make a big impact on a small budget.

""We all know that the biggest bargain in the world is a gallon of paint,"" said Jeffrey Bilhuber, an interior designer whose upscale clients include Anna Wintour and Iman, but whose new book from Rizzoli, ""Everyday Decorating,"" offers punchy decorating tips for everyone. A fresh coat of paint on walls that have become smudged over the years will immediately renew a room, and a change of color can transform it. ""Color connotes confidence,"" Mr. Bilhuber said, and painting the walls a bold one ""means that you're confident in the place that you live.""

""It made a huge difference and changed the whole atmosphere,"" he said, by making the space seem bigger and brighter. In smaller rooms, he recommended painting brick walls after giving them a light skim-coat of plaster to reduce surface irregularities. Although many people prize exposed brick, he said, ""it can suck energy and light from a room."" Painting it lightens things up, while leaving an appealing texture. Mr. Fong suggested using a contrasting paint color to play up attractive molding, or even to create a wainscot effect. ""Painting a line of color that's about three feet high and goes to the ground is a really nice, interesting way to add a visual vector,"" he said. ""If you want to get fancy with it, put a chair rail at the top.""

Changing a room by swapping out throw pillows is such a well-worn concept, Mr. Bilhuber said, that ""if somebody says 'change your pillows' one more time, I'm going to change my job."" But, he admitted, that doesn't make the strategy any less effective. Adding pillows and a throw in a bright color to a sofa can make a statement in a living room, Mr. Bilhuber said, and you can do the same in a bedroom with minimal expense. ""You can change your bedding in a flash by just changing the pillowcases. They could be daffodil yellow, garnet or sapphire blue -- boom,"" he said. ""Keep everything else straightforward.""

Another easy, affordable way to bring color into a space, Mr. Bilhuber suggested, is with new lampshades. ""Buy yellow instead of white,"" he said -- or choose aubergine, as he did for his home in Locust Valley, N.Y. Mr. Cooper offered similar advice. ""You can get off-the-shelf shades in all different shapes, sizes and colors, which will change the look of a lamp super easily,"" he said. For a client in TriBeCa, Mr. Cooper installed black shades on vintage 1970s Pierre Cardin lamps, which gave them ""a whole new point of view and a little glamour."" Or try painting white lampshades with stripes, as Mr. Cooper sometimes does, to make them a striking visual feature.

""Change your light bulbs -- it can be that fast and economical,"" Mr. Bilhuber said. ""I walk home at night and see some of the most egregious mistakes when I look up into apartment houses."" Specifically, Mr. Bilhuber said, he sees too much bright bluish-white light. ""You should always use warm light, whether it's incandescent or LED,"" he advised, which typically means installing bulbs with a color temperature of 3,000 Kelvin or lower. Next, he said, ""Bring down the wattage. You do not need to be cutting diamonds in your apartment. Low levels of lighting improve the mood.""

Not every piece of furniture and accessory needs to be a showstopper. A single distinctive object can create a focal point and enhance the appearance of a larger space. ""One special thing can elevate a whole room,"" said Vanessa Alexander, the founder of Alexander Design, in Santa Monica, Calif. ""We always try to include something vintage or one of a kind in every room. It's something that can't be easily replicated and has a story."" In one Malibu, Calif., home, Ms. Alexander added a 1950s chair by Osvaldo Borsani to a corner of the living room. It is as much a sculptural element, she noted, as a place to sit. For her own home in Malibu, she found a perforated, brass-globe pendant lamp at a flea market and had it rewired as a statement piece for a sunroom. ""It adds a textural moment,"" she said. ""And at night, it gives off a pattern"" when illuminated.

""A lot of those mirrors came from flea markets and thrift stores,"" Mr. Fong said. ""You go to the flea market and find an amazing tray, interesting tabletop items or interesting art, and it can really do a lot for an environment."" In his new book, Mr. Bilhuber writes that ""art can animate a room even if it isn't trophy art."" Expanding on that idea, he explained that you don't need to spend thousands of dollars to put art to work in an interior. ""Some of the chicest projects I've ever worked on had masterworks next to framed posters,"" he said. ""Go to MoMA and get a $100 masterwork in poster format, and make no excuses. It's human, it's real, it's humble."" Or buy pieces by lesser-known or unknown artists simply because they appeal to you. Better yet, Mr. Bilhuber said, work with what you already have. ""You're always going to have those five pictures you've had since your first apartment,"" he said. ""Take them down and start fresh. Lay them all out on the floor and look at them together. Just rehanging them in a way that is more uniform, or like a collage, can make the difference.""

""Find a room scent you love,"" said Mr. Bilhuber, who prefers home-fragrance sprays over scented candles. ""There can be a difference between your apartment and everyone else's. There can be a difference between what's happening in the hallway and your living room."" His favorite, he said, is Amber & Smoke from Paddywax's Apothecary collection. ""I use it every night before I go to bed,"" he said. ""Two or three spritzes and you're transported to a completely different place than where you were two seconds before.""

A smartphone-obsessed man gets more than he swiped for in this new anthology series, which is based on a 1980s sci-fi show created by Steven Spielberg. The first episode stars Dylan O'Brien as a man who is unwittingly transported from 2019 to the early 20th century through supernatural means. He makes the best of it, finding unlikely love in a rebellious local played by Victoria Pedretti.

Like the book, the film distorts both time period and gender; it stars Tilda Swinton as its title character, who begins the story as a 17th-century English nobleman and ends it as a late 20th-century author and mother. Potter ""takes a huge, audacious and necessary leap away from the page,"" Caryn James wrote in her review for The New York Times. ""The film distills Woolf's rich literary manner into sumptuous backdrops and visual styles that change with the centuries, suggesting a pageant of art history from Renaissance chiaroscuro to misty Romanticism and beyond.""","The 1980s series ""Amazing Stories"" has been reimagined on Apple TV Plus.

Julien Baker, Phoebe Bridgers and Lucy Dacus are kindred spirits, all dedicated to immaculate melodies that carry soul-baring lyrics. Now they're collaborating as boygenius. In ""Me & My Dog,"" they share vocal harmonies and sketch a precious, short-lived affair with a musician: ""I cried at your show with the teenagers."" As plain strumming builds up to an electric-guitar squall. they sing, ""I never said I'd be all right/Just thought I could hold myself together""; there's some consolation in their solidarity. JON PARELES

Sonia Sturino's voice on ""Blue Again"" is willfully jumpy: quavering, bleating, cracking, sometimes nearly yodeling. ""I'm a little bit awkward, the way I stumble,"" she sings, and later, ""I liked me better when I wasn't so insecure."" Her band, Weakened Friends, is a trio topped by her guitar, working the Pixies' dynamics of a twangy line in the verse and blaring chords in the chorus. And as self-conscious as her lyrics are, the way her voice leaps around -- like a polygraph test during an earthquake -- is anything but insecure. PARELES

The Scottish pop songwriter Nina Nesbitt offers advice and details some pitfalls of digital-era dating -- ""hope you never let those pictures send/he's only gonna shoot them to his friends"" -- in a briskly efficient track that meshes staccato acoustic guitar, trap hi-hats and a hint of Latin rhythm. In case her attitude isn't no-nonsense enough, Ms. Nesbitt, trained as a gymnast, struts and lip-syncs her way through the video clip in point shoes. PARELES

On ""Nyeusi,"" the drummer Justin Brown's standout debut album, he was awash in synths, electronic wind instruments and effects, nudging the focus away from his huge talents onto the band's cascading textures and arcing melodies. He is one of two drummers on ""Opening,"" from the keyboardist and pan-experimentalist John Escreet's ""Learn to Live,"" an album due this fall. Four tracks use both drummers (the other is Eric Harland), and throughout Mr. Escreet is doing something like the inverse of ""Nyeusi:"" He's taking his plush harmonies and textures as a given, and focusing instead on heavy skirmishes of rhythm. GIOVANNI RUSSONELLO

""Come All You Coal Miners,"" a vintage agitprop lament about coal mining as wage slavery, opens this track in unexpected form, a long way from traditionalism, with Abigail Washburn's near a cappella vocal over eerie electronic tones that may involve banjos in reverse. ""Take Me to Harlan"" arrives in a more acoustic guise, accompanied by Fleck's stark (and harmonically audacious) banjo syncopations and Ms. Washburn's clog dancing. Meanwhile, in the video, Pilobolus dancers swing mining picks. PARELES

Camille Thurman is going for disarming more than dazzling, as a vocalist as well as a tenor saxophonist. It's a refreshing stance, especially for a young, post-bop musician with buckets of talent and plenty still on the line. On ""Waiting for the Sunrise,"" Ms. Thurman's new album, she leaves the saxophone alone almost completely. It's a shame not to hear the instrument more, but there are moments when the vocals-heavy m.o. makes sense. The Cole Porter standard ""Easy to Love"" is well suited to Ms. Thurman's bright and peppery singing, and there's little not to like about this up-tempo take. It starts on a cross-stepping pattern from the band and hits a high stride toward the end, on Ms. Thurman's scatting solo. RUSSONELLO

For music that's rhythmically and spatially disorienting, immersive yet transparent, sinister yet sneakily comic, drop the needle (or click the cursor) just about anywhere in the eight hours of ""NTS Sessions 1-4,"" the latest magnum opus by the British electronic duo Autechre. First heard on the English online station NTS and released this week on CDs and vinyl, the music of ""NTS Sessions"" is largely atonal and proudly artificial, with computerized sounds that materialize, recur and mutate, defining patterns then melting them down, exploring both propulsion and meditation. Among many cryptic titles, one that makes sense is ""Xflood."" It starts with twitchy attacks and layers on increasingly funky syncopations, but the sustained tones of a synthetic choir seep in to dissolve and drown it all.

Real Estate,"In Jackson Heights, a Tower Looms Large and Interesting",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/14/realestate/in-jackson-heights-a-tower-looms-large-and-interesting.html,"Five years ago, Sherif Ashmawy and Stacy Wells moved into a one-bedroom condo at Toren, a high-rise in Downtown Brooklyn. It cost $370,000, with monthly fees in the mid $600s. The couple, who met 10 years ago as students while working at a Chinese restaurant in Burlington, Vt., knew they couldn't live in a small one-bedroom forever. Prices surged. Last winter they decided it was time to sell the condo and buy a two-family house. ""We would have loved a four-family, but could afford only two,"" Ms. Wells said.

Ms. Wells and Mr. Ashmawy, both in their 30s, saw places that were easy to turn down, with dangerously steep staircases or odd layouts. They visited a two-family brick house in Jackson Heights, Queens, with a driveway and garage. It was listed for $899,000. Ms. Wells, a native of Louisiana who works in the field of occupational health and safety, found the historic neighborhood charming. Mr. Ashmawy, who grew up in Manhattan and is employed in bank technology, thought Queens was too residential. The house needed work, which ""reinforced in his head that he didn't want to move to Queens,"" Ms. Wells said. Her husband insisted on Brooklyn. ""I was bummed,"" she said. That house sold for $850,000.

In Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn, the couple loved a two-family for $899,000. It was also in need of work; they weren't even sure it had electricity. But they were excited about its location, just a block from Prospect Park. Their bid of $960,000 was declined, and it sold for $999,000. In nearby Kensington, a two-family was listed at $979,000, but the playground next door was a potential source of noise. And there weren't many stores nearby. ""It seems like you were going to walk far to get somewhere,"" Ms. Wells said.

They weren't enthusiastic enough to bid on it, and it sold for $1.1 million. Another two-family house, in Windsor Terrace, for $899,000, was on a triangular lot, which narrowed ""to a focal point someplace in the backyard, so it turns into a pizza-pie house,"" Mr. Ashmawy said. They didn't like the location of the master bedroom, next to the front door. The low ceiling of the finished basement made Mr. Ashmawy hunch. ""I am a taller guy, so I was crashing around like Quasimodo,"" he said. They passed it by; it sold for $900,000. Soon, Ms. Wells saw a listing for a ""Spanish Tower Home,"" one of about 10 such houses built around 1927 in Jackson Heights. The price was $959,000. Mr. Ashmawy, despite his aversion to Queens, agreed to at least see it. ""Castle, fine, we can go with a castle,"" he said. Besides, by now, ""it became apparent that Brooklyn wasn't going to happen.""

This viewing was different from the crowded open houses they were used to. The listing agent, Daniel Karatzas of the Beaudoin Realty Group, the author of the 1990 book ""Jackson Heights: A Garden in the City,"" preferred scheduled showings of half an hour. Ms. Wells booked the last appointment on a weekend. The two-family house retained many original details in addition to its tower, Mr. Karatzas said, including the original lighting fixtures and black-and-white tiled bathrooms. The house had a lot going for it besides a little history -- a three-bedroom unit topped by a two-bedroom, a fireplace, a partly finished basement, a driveway and garage shared with the house next door.","Having graduated from a one-bedroom, Stacy Wells and Sherif Ashmawy wanted a two-family house.",241a79ec-fb2a-57cc-be90-b16c606a7ac8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/12/14/realestate/14HUNT1/14HUNT1-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=a74642dfb2363f0ba2863c8f9909a2342277ba87e2a6466c96f291c422b001ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,THE BUYERS Sherif Ashmawy and Stacy Wells were won over by a 1927 house in Jackson Heights.,241a79ec-fb2a-57cc-be90-b16c606a7ac8,N24News/imgs/241a79ec-fb2a-57cc-be90-b16c606a7ac8.jpg,7
Movies,'Sharkwater Extinction' Review: A Plea to Stop Killing Sharks,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/28/movies/sharkwater-extinction-review.html,"Each time I've seen shark fin soup on a restaurant menu, it sounded conceptually sketchy. ""The fin is considered a delicacy,"" I recall being told, and there was the rub: Only the fin? What about the rest of the shark?

Well, turns out it's as bad as I thought. ""Sharkwater Extinction,"" the third feature film directed by the scuba diver and activist Rob Stewart, reveals a cruel market in which tens of millions of sharks are caught every year, their fins cut off and their bodies thrown back in the water to die.

In his narration, Stewart recounts how he thought that if his films could make people love these animals, he could push popular opinion against their being hunted. He doesn't quite pull this off here, despite impressive footage of him swimming with sharks. He does, however, convince us that these superpredators are important to oceanic ecosystems and that because they are so indiscriminate in their eating habits, they are full of toxins. Even if there were a way to fish for them humanely (there isn't), Stewart argues sharks ought not be eaten at all.",A documentary reveals a cruel market in which tens of millions of sharks are caught every year to meet the demand for fin soup.,c54fc5f3-7580-5f45-86a8-cfc3fd6112da,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/01/arts/01sharkwater/01sharkwater-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=c700f27a77dab1107705df68a6e953bda9dfc4cae945b824849e97c0b84e7834&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Rob Stewart in &ldquo;Sharkwater Extinction.&rdquo;,c54fc5f3-7580-5f45-86a8-cfc3fd6112da,N24News/imgs/c54fc5f3-7580-5f45-86a8-cfc3fd6112da.jpg,5
Fashion & Style,Should Masks Be a Fashion Statement?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/fashion/coronavirus-fashion-face-masks.html,"Almost as soon as Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada and Brooks Brothers announced earlier this month that they would be repurposing parts of their factories to make masks and hospital gowns, the memes and comments started flying. ""Patterns include gingham, Black Watch tartan, rep tie, Glen plaid, and little sailboats,"" joked one tweet. ""Breaking News from the world of haute couture: Since humans on Earth will be wearing face protection masks against Covid-19 pretty much EVERYWHERE over the next year, they're bound to become the hottest new fashion accessory. Ready for the Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Armani and ..."" went another.

But you can understand the misconceptions. That's because the masks coming from almost everywhere else are another story. Masks are now encouraged for all -- teetering between medical necessity and fashion statement, whether conscious or not. Designers, entrepreneurs and influencers sense opportunity. But if we all have to wear them, we should start thinking about what they say. Last week Vogue posted a story touting ""Masks To Shop Now."" Almost every day brings an announcement (or two or three) of another company introducing masks -- or an old company pivoting to offer them. There are now tie-dye masks. Masks made of silk, denim and the polyester and elastane used for bathing suits. Masks that come with reversible sequins, like those pillows and backpacks that were a tween trend in the world before.

There is a MaskClub.com, which is kind of like DollarShaveClub.com (but not exactly) with licensing deals with Hello Kitty and NASA and Batman, among others, so you can advertise your taste in cartoons or sports for $9.99 a month. Masks in tartan, camouflage and batik. Sparkly masks that suggest ""I am ready for a party"" and pinstriped masks that suggest ""I am ready to work."" Masks by Stacy Bendet of Alice + Olivia, in animal and floral print, for $12.95. Masks by Collina Strada made from deadstock with giant bows on the side for $100. A mask, pretty much, for every mood and income level. And now that countries like Morocco, Austria and the Czech Republic, and states including New York, New Jersey and Maryland, have mandated masks in public areas where social distancing is not possible, the burgeoning industry is only going to get bigger. According to Edited, the digital retail tracking service, there has been an almost 40 percent increase in the number of masks offered by companies in the first quarter of 2020 compared to the end of 2019. In a blog post earlier this month, Josh Silverman, the chief executive of Etsy, reported that in a single weekend, buyers searched for face masks on the site an average of nine times per second, and the number of face mask sellers had grown five times, to almost 20,000. Experts are increasingly suggesting that masks may need to be worn for at least a year, until a vaccine is developed. And trend forecasters are predicting that, as a result, they may become a fact of daily life, donned by all of us with the same unthinking passivity as a coat and sunglasses when we leave the house. But does that mean they should also become, like a coat and sunglasses, an individual fashion statement? Or are they, rather, a sign of something else: solidarity, and the social contract?

The coronavirus is a crisis that respects no economic division. Everyone is a potential victim; everyone has been affected. The blue and white surgical masks that are currently the most visible personal protective equipment are democratizing forces, rendering all wearers equal under isolation, signifying our communal experience and our collective fear. Even the homemade masks that have begun to proliferate, while somewhat idiosyncratic, are united in their craftiness. When masks migrate into the realm of fashion, however, they become something else. As with all accessories (as with shoes, bags and scarves), they become symbols of not just health or social concern, but of identity. After all, with the lower face covered and, often, eyes shaded by sunglasses, the usual signposts of character are hidden. The mask becomes the first signifier of the individual. And that means it will also become a sign of aspiration, achievement -- and inequality. Masks, as a recent story in WWD posited, could even end up on the red carpet -- in the form of a ""couture mask."" Christian Siriano, one of the first designers to start making masks when Governor Cuomo asked for help, told the publication he has made ""this fully encrusted pearl mask because I just needed a break."" ""It's actually pretty fabulous,"" he said. Maybe even President Trump, who has made something of a big deal out of his own reluctance to wear a mask, would don the accessory if it could be used, as he uses his ties and MAGA hats, to broadcast his own power. He did, after all, inaugurate a Louis Vuitton factory in Texas currently being used to make cotton masks.

This kind of evolution is natural. It may be inevitable. It is the kind of human impulse fashion is built to serve. And it is occurring in markets in Tokyo and in Seoul, though not as much in Hong Kong, where the use of masks as a tool of protest and disguise still outweighs their use as a marker of personality. Luxury brands may not be making masks now (just imagine the backlash), but it's not too big a leap to believe there will come a time when they join the bandwagon, if simply because there is likely to be demand. Besides, they already have the expertise and capabilities. Yet it is hard to avoid the nagging sense that designers are exploiting fear born during a pandemic for their own ends (and profit), and that consumers are using what is a medical necessity, one that is the most visible representation of the pain and isolation currently shared by so many, in a decorative way. Capitalist opportunities often emerge from times of trauma. This may be one of them. But that doesn't make the origin story any less uncomfortable. In part this is why many brands have adopted a ""buy one, give one"" model, in which for every mask that is bought, they will give one to a worker on the front line (or in Collina Strada's case, buy one for a lot of money in order to give five). Or they are donating a portion of each sale to a Covid-19-related charity.

This is also why some include explanations with the designs, couching them in civic-minded terms, like this one from MaskClub: ""Founder Trevor George's 8-month-old son was terrified to see him wear a mask, so he decided to make them with recognizable prints to make it less scary."" It can seem like a Band-Aid for a guilty conscience. And maybe it is. Yet you can't argue with the need for masks, or that many of the companies making them are doing so because there is little other option: No one is buying the clothes they make, and to create something -- anything -- for sale is to create a lifeline for employees and suppliers. In that sense, every mask also represents labor and income at a time when both are in short supply. A sale can help buoy a small company. Perhaps it is time to let consumers know exactly how much. Price transparency -- an accounting of a brand's production costs, markups and where the money is going -- has been attempted by a few companies, including Honestby.com, the Bruno Pieters e-tail site that closed in 2018. But it never took off. (After all, it never seemed in a brand's interests.) This, however, is a different time. Price transparency now would allow informed judgments from consumers, and ameliorate concerns about profiteering over an item that should ultimately represent community and shared experience. There has been a lot of talk about how the current crisis could change behavior and the fashion system. Maybe this is a place to start.",Capitalist opportunities often emerge from times of trauma.

Automobiles,Flexing Some Korean Muscle,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/18/automobiles/autoreviews/hyundai-genesis-flexing-some-korean-muscle.html,"WHAT IS IT? A Korean muscle sedan. Possibly the first-ever Korean muscle sedan.

HOW MUCH? $47,350 base; $47,385 as tested with one option, an iPod cable ($35).

WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? A 5-liter direct-injected V-8 (429 horsepower, 376 pound-feet of torque); 8-speed automatic transmission.

IS IT THIRSTY? The E.P.A. rating is 16 m.p.g. in town, 25 highway.

THE Hyundai Genesis 5.0 R-Spec looks good on paper. With 429 horsepower, the R-Spec's Tau V-8 outguns even the 420-horsepower twin-turbocharged V-8 in the 2013 Audi S6. At $47,385, the R-Spec costs less than a V-6-powered Infiniti M37. And with four logos on the trunk, the Hyundai Genesis 5.0 R-Spec has 100 percent more trunk badges than a Cadillac CTS.

This thing beats Pep Boys at their own game.

There are a few subtle changes to augment the increased horsepower. The R-Spec wheels, at 19 inches, are one inch larger than the wheels on the Genesis 4.6 model. The rear antiroll bar is one millimeter thicker. The R-Spec suspension is treated to a ""sport-tuned calibration,"" according to Hyundai, but it still favors comfort over cornering velocity.","In the revised Genesis lineup, the 5.0 R-Spec, with its 429-horsepower V-8, is the star.

Art & Design,"In 'Drill,' Hito Steyerl Adds Polish to Images of a World Gone Mad",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/05/arts/design/hito-steyerl-drill-armory.html,"Visitors to the Park Avenue Armory, the crenelated citadel that takes up an entire city block on the Upper East Side, are accustomed to seeing its cavernous Drill Hall retrofitted with bleachers and sales booths, dance floors, even tennis courts. But Hito Steyerl, the German artist and philosopher of our present technological debasement, has left the space largely empty, illuminated only by some lighting underfoot and three massive screens. In this inky vastness, you can remember that what's now a palatial arts center was once meant for something else. The building we're in is ""quite literally a fortress,"" an onscreen guide tells us, and beneath our feet is ""a shooting gallery."" We've come to see ""Drill,"" a video installation that anchors a mini-retrospective of the same name here, on view through July 21. It's a blaring, impassioned denunciation of American gun violence and the latent aggression of high culture; and while it lacks the zany brilliance of her best work, the installation offers further proof of the force of Ms. Steyerl's gaze on technology, politics and war. Ms. Steyerl, born in Munich in 1966, has become an icon to younger artists for her video installations, as well as her sparky, digressive essays on art and the internet. She's been working hard lately, producing two new works for this year's Venice Biennale; another for an exhibition at the Castello di Rivoli museum in Turin, Italy; and yet another in London for the Serpentine Galleries, whose sponsorship from the Sackler family, linked to the drug OxyContin, she described as being ""married to a serial killer."" Many of Ms. Steyerl's works have zeroed in on the violent pasts and presents of cultural institutions, as well as the residual militarism of digital technology. In her lecture performance ""Is the Museum a Battlefield?,"" on loop in one of the Armory's smaller rooms, she unearths the centuries-long relationship between war and contemporary art, reminding us that two of the world's greatest museums, the Louvre in Paris and the Hermitage in St. Petersburg, Russia, were sites of actual revolutions.

Ms. Steyerl invites several survivors of gun violence, projected at an enormous scale on the screens, to explore the Armory's rich interiors and foundational links to guns. One teenager talks about shootings in her low-income neighborhood; a man in a wheelchair says he's been to more funerals than he can count. Ms. Steyerl, with her customarily brilliant editing, intercuts their testimonies with footage filmed in the Drill Hall of the Yale Precision Marching Band -- musicians with military discipline -- who play a score of clattering percussion and roaring brass. The score, we learn when the credits roll, was algorithmically composed with data related to mass shootings in the United States; each note is a record of death. There's an uncommon heavy-handedness to much of ""Drill,"" and an uncommon glossiness to the cinematography. For as early as 2007 -- a lifetime ago, in internet years -- Ms. Steyerl saw that the digital imagery that really mattered would be what she called ""the poor image"": low-resolution, data-compressed pictures and videos, easy to edit, that can rocket through the global media stream. The poor image -- it can be a political speech, a sex tape, a hostage video, a cat GIF, a bootleg video of ""Avatar"" -- ""mocks the promises of digital technology,"" she argued in an essay a decade ago. It ""transforms quality into accessibility, exhibition value into cult value, films into clips, contemplation into distraction."" In ""Is the Museum a Battlefield?"" she makes ample use of such images, illustrating one passage on art and revolution, for instance, with a pixelated Spanish-subtitled copy of Sergei Eisenstein's ""October: Ten Days That Shook the World.""

Despite higher-than-usual production value, ""Drill"" continues Ms. Steyerl's investigation into a world mediated by poor images. At several moments, the left and right screens present crisp footage of the Drill Hall, while the center screen takes us to the Armory's basement, which she films in crummy lighting with a shaky hand-held camera. Down there, a school principal points out bullet holes in the walls while discussing Alex Jones, whose conspiracy website Infowars specializes in disinformation. In the video's final moments, Ms. Steyerl pans over the ornate walls of the Armory's front hallway, and replaces the framed portraits of 19th-century soldiers with footage of young anti-gun activists such as Emma Gonzalez, a survivor of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida. The activists appear within gold frames -- but they've been inserted sloppily, imprecisely, with little attempt at a persuasive deception. What saves ""Drill"" from preaching-to-the-choirism are these intentionally janky edits, which Ms. Steyerl uses to inscribe America's gun-violence epidemic into a larger social and epistemological breakdown. Making the deadly defensible requires images, ""Drill"" insists, and different images over time. In the 19th century, the Armory's founders did it with oil paintings and Tiffany glass; a character in ""Drill"" purrs that they ""spared no expense to make war beautiful."" Now this glorification takes place through poor images -- perhaps with martial music and special effects -- made by gun lovers who sometimes smear victims as crisis actors or deserving marks. (Ms. Gonzalez, for instance, appeared in a doctored photo that made her look like she was tearing apart the Constitution.)

For Ms. Steyerl, today's onslaught of memes and copies, selfies and death threats, is the natural expression of a society whose politics takes place through images. Consider so-called deepfakes, increasingly sophisticated manipulations of video that, some immoderate columnists wheeze, have the potential to ""destroy democracy."" Here, too, artists have political analysts beat by years -- at the 2015 New Museum Triennial, Josh Kline used face-substitution video technologies to rewrite Barack Obama's inaugural address -- but really, how could anyone still think that doctored videos have to become more convincing before anyone buys them? The recent viral video of Nancy Pelosi, her speech slowed to make her sound drunk or ill, was no deepfake. The editing was, as with the grafted gun-survivor footage in ""Drill,"" transparently poor, made in a matter of minutes. Yet it was watched millions of times, eventually trickling all the way up to ""Fox & Friends."" This is the political world made by the poor image: Each picture or video is, in Ms. Steyerl's words, ""passed on as a lure, a decoy, an index, or as a reminder of its former visual self."" THE COMPLAINT THAT MEDIA is more ""real"" than reality is decades old by now, and these days, Ms. Steyerl demonstrates, both media and reality are metastasizing in ways that make the distinction meaningless. Digital media doesn't stay on screens but bleeds past them -- in Bitcoin-fueled climate degradation, in New York storefronts full of algorithmically produced junk, in a genocide boosted by Facebook.

An uncanny bleeding across the digital realm and reality also animates Ms. Steyerl's landmark lecture performance ""Duty Free Art"" (2015). One screen shows her, speaking with the wry conviction that marks her best performances, as she maps a boggling network of shifting power centers in war, finance and high culture. War criminals buy and sell paintings stored in Swiss free ports without ever seeing them; the Syrian civil war forces a Turkish museum to close and become a refugee camp, while pro-Assad forces hack Justin Bieber's Twitter account (and the website of The New York Times). On the adjacent screen, as well as on a sandbox topped by a projector, screenshots from the websites of the Financial Times and the Economist, as well as search results from Google Images and other poor-image documents show a world gone mad. Unlike in ""Drill,"" whose condemnation of American violence land with a bland power-to-the-people thud, the revelations of culture and violence in Ms. Steyerl's earlier works have a bitter, flabbergasted humor -- as if she can hardly believe how weird, scary and dumb things can get when the digital seeps beyond the screen. Her art offers no escape, but it may, through critique and analysis, provide a pathway through the stream of images. As she says in ""Duty Free Art,"" the undifferentiated flood of political violence and vapid memes, climate collapse and celebrity divorces, seems to be plunging us all into ""permanent hyperactive depression.""

Television,"Shelley Morrison, 'Will & Grace' Actress, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/02/arts/television/shelley-morrison-dead.html,"Shelley Morrison, whose 64-year acting career included playing the memorable maid Rosario on the NBC series ""Will & Grace"" from 1999 to 2006, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 83.

Her husband, Walter Dominguez, said the cause was heart failure.

He added, ""She believed that the best way to change hearts and minds was through comedy.""

Opinion,Could It Be Bush v. Gore All Over Again?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/27/opinion/sunday/trump-biden-2020-supreme-court.html,"This is not a column about a case that's pending at the Supreme Court -- yet. It's about the nightmare scenarios surrounding the presidential election and its aftermath that could conceivably propel a case there. Such scenarios are being contemplated and written about with increasing urgency as President Trump ramps up his predictions of voter fraud, setting the stage for challenging the legitimacy of an election that he appears, at this point at least, likely to lose. Trying to chase such thoughts from my mind only seems to magnify a growing free-floating anxiety to which I've recently attached a diagnosis: Bush v. Gore PTSD. Anyone who lived through the denouement of the 2000 presidential election will understand what I mean; it's hard to believe that an entire generation has come of age with no personal memory of what happened that cold December night nearly 20 years ago when a five-justice majority handed the presidency to George W. Bush. But I was there in the Supreme Court pressroom on Dec. 12, 2000, as the clock ticked down toward midnight and the country held its breath to see what would become of Florida's 25 outcome-determinative electoral votes. In the pressroom, we assumed that the justices, who had heard argument on the disputed Florida election only the day before, had voted and that they intended to issue their decision that night, in time to meet the statutory ""safe harbor"" deadline for a state to immunize its electoral-vote result from challenge in Congress. With six million Floridians having voted, George W. Bush was ahead of Al Gore by 537 votes. A decision might come at any moment, so no one dared to leave the small room. It became packed so tightly with reporters and television crews from around the world that my most pressing fear was that the enclosed space would run out of oxygen and we would all be asphyxiated.

And then it was over. At 10 o'clock, with an unsigned and barely rationalized opinion issued over four signed dissents, the court barred all further counting. The justices had left the building. All the public saw that night were television correspondents, bundled against the wind on the court's plaza, frantically turning pages to try to figure out what to tell their audience. Could something like that happen again? Two weeks ago, Slate asked 10 election-law and constitutional experts to describe the scenario that ""keeps them up at night."" Most of what they described couldn't plausibly involve the Supreme Court -- or could it? For example, Prof. Bruce Ackerman of Yale Law School conjured a meltdown in which the election is thrown into Congress and Vice President Mike Pence, as president of the Senate, and Nancy Pelosi, as speaker of the House, can't agree on how to proceed and there is violence in the streets as Inauguration Day dawns without an agreed-upon president. The Presidential Succession Act would seem to make Speaker Pelosi the president under such circumstances. Would the Supreme Court feel moved to so declare? Or suppose, as Daniel Carpenter of the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study at Harvard suggests in the Slate article, that Republican-led legislatures in potentially decisive states embrace the president's claim of fraud and refuse to certify a clear Biden victory. Some of these states have Democratic governors or secretaries of state. What happens if each tries to block the other's slate of electors? The most fully developed dystopian forecast is a recently published book by Lawrence Douglas, a professor at Amherst College. Titled ""Will He Go? Trump and the Looming Election Meltdown in 2020,"" the book is most frightening not for its author's fertile imagination about what could possibly happen but rather for its account of how few actual safeguards stand between order and chaos. ""Nothing compelled Gore to concede,"" Professor Douglas writes of the losing candidate's rapid acquiescence to the Supreme Court's decision. ""Gore's action reminds us of an essential truth: Our Constitution does not secure the peaceful transition of power, but rather presupposes it."" And statutory law isn't much more helpful than the Constitution, Professor Douglas points out. For example, the Electoral Count Act of 1887, which Congress enacted to avoid another crisis like the Hayes-Tilden debacle of 1876, fails to specify what would actually happen if an election was thrown into Congress amid a dispute over which electors represent a state's vote.

The law says: ""If more than one return or paper purporting to be a return from a state shall have been received by the president of the Senate, those votes, and those only, shall be counted which shall have been regularly given."" Regularly given? If regularity was clear, the election most likely wouldn't have ended up in Congress in the first place. In my observation, ""What keeps you up at night?"" has become a question almost as standard as ""How are things?"" used to be. I put that question the other day to Gary Hart, a former Democratic senator from Colorado. Along with fellow Democrat Timothy Wirth, also a former Colorado senator, he and a dozen other concerned and politically astute citizens recently formed a bipartisan organization they named Keep Our Republic. Its mission is to educate the public, largely at this point through op-eds, about current threats to democracy. The prospect of an electoral meltdown is only one of the organization's concerns, and not necessarily the main one. ""The president's secret powers,"" was Gary Hart's answer to my question. He pointed me to the work of Elizabeth Goitein, a scholar at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Starting years before the Trump administration -- this is not a partisan issue -- she has studied the phenomenon of presidential ""emergency action documents"" that exist deep under the radar, ready to be invoked without congressional oversight or even notice. The text of these documents, numbering between 50 and 60 by Ms. Goitein's estimate, has never been released, and the powers the documents purport to grant the president have evidently never been invoked. They are thought to authorize such drastic actions as the presidential suspension of habeas corpus, warrantless searches and the imposition of martial law. The Keep Our Republic group wants congressional hearings to shine a public spotlight on this archive's existence if not all of its secret specifics. Something else to worry about, for sure. But it's Bush v. Gore that haunts me. I have a full shelf of books about the case -- on a high shelf, so I don't risk seeing it by chance. I reached for a few of those books while writing this, just to check dates and facts. Even strong memories can prove elusive. Of today's Supreme Court justices, only three were on the court in 2000: Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer. But the other six were all adults 20 years ago. They have memories, too. But do they have nightmares? The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles.

The inspiration for street names like Canal and Spring may be lost to time and development. But the landscape feature that prompted Park survives, front and center. The long avenue stretches nearly 10 miles, across two boroughs, from East 32nd Street in Manhattan to East 189th Street in the Bronx, where it ends near an Applebee's. But it is perhaps best known for the section below 96th Street. For much of that stretch, a ribbon of lawns, trees and hedges unfurls between the avenue's northbound and southbound arteries. In recent weeks, slender tiny parkland has welcomed beds of scarlet tulips and sculptures with yellow rubber wrapped around poles.

Mr. Soussloff, 65, demurred when asked to share apartment details. But a five-bedroom in his building is currently listed for $8.5 million. Clouds may be on the horizon. Lenox Hill Hospital, which takes up a full block at East 77th Street, wants to expand its maternity ward and emergency department, along with other upgrades. Among the more contentious elements is a plan for a 200-unit condominium to help subsidize the $2.5 billion redevelopment. The Park-facing high-rise, to be built by an as-yet-unnamed developer, would soar 41 stories, more than double the height of the skyline now. Mr. Soussloff calls the project ""inappropriate"" as currently scaled, though, like other opponents, he values the hospital's proximity. He and neighbors in about a dozen buildings are girding for battle. ""We want to push back,"" he said. On a project website, Lenox Hill, which is owned by Northwell Health, said it is under the same financial strain as nonprofits like the Brooklyn Public Library, which is developing a 134-unit condo in Brooklyn Heights. The expansion ""cannot be achieved without monetization of a portion of the hospital's valuable real estate,"" the site says.

The apartment, with a beamed ceiling and casement windows, might fetch $500,000 today. But Dr. Kahen-Kashi isn't selling. Although she has rented out the unit for two years, since moving to Long Island, where she lives with her husband and two children, a future pied-a-terre has not been ruled out. ""Park,"" she said, ""has cachet."" From East 32nd to East 96th Streets, Park Avenue seems buttoned up, like a Brooks Brothers shirt. Fashioned in serious brick and stone, residential buildings dating to the 1920s and 1930s are largely similar and kept looking their prewar best by numerous historic districts. (Lenox Hill Hospital doesn't sit in one.) For metal facades or swooping rooflines, buyers should look elsewhere. 605 PARK AVENUE, NO. 10B | A two-bedroom, two-bathroom co-op with a combined living-and-dining area with built-in bookshelves, in a white-brick building, listed for $1.585 million. 646-210-3177 Joshua Bright for The New York Times Blocks typically have no more than three apartment buildings. And some have only one -- like Park Avenue between East 93rd and 94th, where the Gothic arches of the fortresslike No. 1185 guard a landscaped courtyard. Another desirable building, on an avenue filled with them, is No. 1088, at East 89th, which also has a peek-a-boo garden. Today, financiers, fashion moguls and chemical tycoons call Park home. A century ago, the makeup wasn't much different, with multimillionaires who hit it big in ""oil, steel, railroads, mining, limber, motorcars, banking, real estate, moving pictures, foreign trade, speculating, the manufacturing of widgets, the marketing of toothpaste, the distribution of the assets of button kings,"" writes Michael Gross in ""740 Park,"" his book about the limestone co-op at East 71st that may be the avenue's most exclusive address. Downstairs, the central stretch of the avenue can seem especially proper, thanks in no small part to the uniforms worn by so many of its doormen, whose caps and epaulets are a common sight. If the sidewalks look spotless, it is not because gum chewers wrap up their leftovers, but because those doormen hose down the pavement. 1150 PARK AVENUE, NO. 2C | A two-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op with a decorative fireplace, a galley kitchen and beamed ceilings, in a prewar building, listed for $999,000. 917-363-1992 Joshua Bright for The New York Times

Other commonplace details include green awnings, brass door handles and medical offices -- of chiropractors, dermatologists and plastic surgeons -- tastefully announced by small, mounted metal plates. ""It's just a whole different feeling, being on Park,"" said Anthony Ortiz, 57, a florist whose store at East 82nd, Design By Anthony Ortiz, opened in 2013 and is one of the few places to shop. Besides providing bouquets for apartments and lobbies, Mr. Ortiz makes sure the avenue's tree pits never look too bare. A few condos, usually in older buildings, can be found up and down the avenue, including at Nos. 80, at 38th Street, and 1235, at 96th. But a new generation of super-tall buildings has also pushed in, among them No. 432, with 88 stories, and No. 520, with 54. As of April 30, there were 273 apartments, mostly co-ops, listed for an average of $4.84 million on StreetEasy (excluding new developments). In contrast, the average home price in Manhattan is $2.12 million, according to Douglas Elliman Real Estate; co-ops average $1.29 million. Still, more than a third of the apartments were listed for less than $2 million.
* None
* Testing the Limits: Only three of New York's 25 tallest residential buildings have completed safety tasks required by the city.
* The Downside to Life in a Supertall: 432 Park faces some significant design problems, and other luxury high-rises may share its fate.
* Luxury Developers' Loophole: Soaring towers are able to push high into the sky because of a loophole in the city's labyrinthine zoning laws.
* An Evolving Skyline: The high-rise building boom has transformed the city's skyline in recent years. Its impact will echo for years to come.
* Hidden Feats: Our critic looks at some supertall N.Y.C. buildings and how the ingenuity of engineers helped build landmarks. The priciest was a seven-bedroom, six-bathroom duplex at No. 515, a late-1990s condo, for $39.5 million; the least expensive was a studio at No. 7, a co-op, for $374,000. 1199 PARK AVENUE, NO. 10B | A one-bedroom, one-bathroom co-op with parquet floors and a galley kitchen, in a red-brick postwar building, listed for $789,000. 917-749-6522 Joshua Bright for The New York Times Although high-end properties across the city are struggling to find buyers, the market on this stretch of Park Avenue seems strong. In 2017, the average closing price for co-ops there was $2.85 million, according to StreetEasy; by 2018, it had jumped to $3.27 million. Condos saw even bigger gains.

But some buildings appear to be weighted with inventory: Ritz Tower, at No. 465, has 18 units listed for sale; the Beekman, at No. 575, has 13; and Trump Park Avenue, No. 502, has eight. Rentals are all over the map: One-bedrooms, for example, can rent for anywhere from $2,500 to $15,000 a month, according to StreetEasy. From the East 40s to the East 50s, the avenue is mostly an office district. Glassy towers offer bank branches on the ground floor and investment banks above. A typical weekday scene finds executives hustling lunch in plastic containers back to their desks. The Park Avenue Armory, at West 66th, holds concerts and plays like ""The Lehman Trilogy,"" about the banking family, which ran this spring. One of the only places to sit, other than those banks' plazas, is a small park inside the avenue's ribbon, at East 96th Street. The park, which sits astride a tunnel, offers an ideal spot to watch the trains below as they emerge into daylight.

Hunter College Campus Schools, which are public but require an entrance exam, offers kindergarten through 12th grade in a medieval-esque former armory at East 94th Street. But many Park Avenue families prefer private schools, and often move to the area to be close to them. Examples include the Allen-Stevenson School, for boys, on East 78th Street, and the Hewitt School, for girls, on East 75th. Except for a 6 train stop at East 33rd, no subways directly serve the avenue. But Lexington Avenue, a block away, has many stops. Reverse commuters can catch Metro-North trains at Grand Central Terminal, at East 42nd Street.

Originally known as Fourth Avenue, Park adopted its current name around the turn of the 20th century. But it took a while to get there. First, the trains, which ran at street level in the 1830s, were submerged in open-air trenches. After several years, those trenches were covered with platforms, and upscale developers followed. Parkland claimed the old train right of way, with walking paths winding through its center. But a 1920s effort to widen the avenue for cars forced the removal of most of those walkways.

Movies,'Sextuplets' Review: Six Marlon Wayanses and Zero Laughs,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/16/movies/sextuplets-review.html,"""Sextuplets,"" the latest made-for-Netflix comedy from the ""White Chicks"" alum Marlon Wayans (following the 2017 rom-com ""Naked""), is about as funny as an amputation and nearly as painful. Wayans stars as Alan, who seeks out his birth mother on the eve of his first child's birth and discovers he was one of six sextuplets -- all of them played by Wayans.

Hilarity, in theory, ensues, although if there is a solid laugh to be found in ""Sextuplets,"" this viewer missed it. The writers pack their script with maddeningly familiar elements: a pending partnership at Alan's company, a zany odd-couple road trip and (two for the price of one) a car chase en route to a hospital delivery room. But each comic set piece decomposes on the screen , lifeless and hopeless .

The supporting players do their best -- Bresha Webb , as Alan's put-upon wife, is spirited and engaging, and Molly Shannon is funny, as Molly Shannon always is -- but this is Wayans's vehicle, and in that respect, it's an embarrassment. The picture's most direct inspiration is ""The Family Jewels,"" in which Jerry Lewis plays six brothers, though the makers of ""Sextuplets"" are clearly attempting to replicate the magic of Eddie Murphy's remake of Lewis's ""The Nutty Professor"" (and its sequel).","The comic's latest Netflix comedy has him playing each of six sextuplets, just not very comically.",c688eff1-4048-5652-b77a-1532ca34d22d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/17/arts/16sextuplets/16sextuplets-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=0f5900c21ee0117c5265bc90216a77bd015b3e66a74aaa3b2568194684c199f7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Marlon Wayans as Alan, left, and also as Russell, in &ldquo;Sextuplets.&rdquo;",c688eff1-4048-5652-b77a-1532ca34d22d,N24News/imgs/c688eff1-4048-5652-b77a-1532ca34d22d.jpg,5
Technology,Uber Faces Federal Inquiry Over Use of Greyball Tool to Evade Authorities,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/04/technology/uber-federal-inquiry-software-greyball.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber is the subject of a United States Department of Justice inquiry over a program that it used to deceive regulators who were trying to shut down its ride-hailing service.

The inquiry concerns Uber's use of a software tool called Greyball, which the company developed in part to aid entrance into new markets where its service was not permitted. The tool allowed Uber to deploy what was essentially a fake version of its app to evade law enforcement agencies that were cracking down on its service.

The New York Times reported on Greyball in March, raising questions about the legality of the practice. After the report, Uber said it would prohibit employees from using the software to thwart regulators.

The federal inquiry was disclosed in a transportation audit conducted by the City of Portland, Ore., published last week. In the audit, Portland officials said they had been notified by the United States attorney's office for the Northern District of California about the existence of the inquiry. The City of Portland said it was cooperating with the inquiry.","The inquiry concerns Uber's use of a software tool called Greyball, which helped identify and evade officials trying to clamp down on the ride-hailing service.",ec641e17-4120-5f00-8709-df80375c25fa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/05/us/05UBER/05UBER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=909663bdcd801030a8e75446a9bae53f8cd5daf7cac376122f4d0de75f3b9873&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The ride-hailing service Uber is under investigation over a software tool it used to evade law enforcement trying to crack down on its service.,ec641e17-4120-5f00-8709-df80375c25fa,N24News/imgs/ec641e17-4120-5f00-8709-df80375c25fa.jpg,20
Movies,'Uncut Gems' Review: Adam Sandler's Punch-Drunk Hustle,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/movies/uncut-gems-review.html,"""Uncut Gems,"" the latest from the brothers Josh and Benny Safdie, blows in like a Category 4 hurricane. It's a tumult of sensory extremes, of images and sounds, lurching shapes, braying voices, intensities of feeling and calculated craziness. So, naturally it stars -- why not? -- Adam Sandler as a cheat, liar, loving dad, bad husband, jealous lover and compulsive gambler who can't stop, won't stop acting the fool.

The Safdies, two of the more playfully inventive filmmakers working in American cinema, won't stop, either, which makes ""Uncut Gems"" fun if also wearying and at times annoying. It doesn't seem to add up to much -- a little man lives his life -- but this is just enough. It's easier to admire than to love, and I hate the ending, but the Safdies clearly like working your nerves. They're not interested in the dumb, easy stuff movies give you -- the likable, relatable characters, the sermonizing and moralizing; they're too busy deploying color and noise, pushing the form, testing their (and our) limits.

Amid this enjoyable chaos, Sandler plays Howard Ratner, who has a small jewelry store in the Diamond District of Manhattan. He has a few employees, one of whom is his mistress (Julia Fox), and an aggrieved wife (Idina Menzel) who's fed up with him. He's a careless family man, but he dotes on his sons and still clocks in for homey obligations. There's a leisurely Passover Seder in the middle of the movie that's suffused with love and alive with squalling kids, bustling women and well-padded men chewing cigars. But Howard has his plagues: He's a gambler and presumably an unlucky one given the heavy debt that he's carrying.

Lots of stuff happens, lots and lots, and some of it can be hard to track. But the bedlam is intentional and amusing. All you need to do is latch onto Howard as he runs from here to there, yelling greetings, taking calls, making deals, always moving amid jump cuts, zooms and lurid close-ups. (The superb cinematography is by Darius Khondji, shooting on 35-millimeter film.) Howard's dodging some toughs who work for a mystery man whom he owes big; the men are scary, bruisers with cruelty etched in their faces and no trace of the usual movie manicuring. One (Keith Williams Richards) punches Howard in the kisser, which is almost understandable.","In the Safdie brothers' new movie, Sandler plays a jewelry-store owner and compulsive gambler running for his life.",4f1c15e4-d94d-580d-b28d-3c5076774e0a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/13/arts/13uncut-1/13uncut-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=bdcc1e994992a8f9050730d8234cdc4d7630b1cdbef0ffe227cd7c363179c7a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Adam Sandler in ""Uncut Gems.""",4f1c15e4-d94d-580d-b28d-3c5076774e0a,N24News/imgs/4f1c15e4-d94d-580d-b28d-3c5076774e0a.jpg,5

A. Instagram, originally an app for posting square smartphone photos, added support for 15-second video clips in 2013. The platform now allows videos up to 60 seconds, and the clips can be in the horizontal format.

This summer, Instagram announced its new stand-alone IGTV app for sharing longer video. (People using the main Instagram app can also watch IGTV videos by tapping the TV icon in the top-right corner of the screen.) However, IGTV has its own specific requirements for videos.","IGTV, the company's new venture, allows longer videos, but your clips need to meet a few requirements.",cece7b5c-c16c-597e-9767-8187ab0ebf21,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/21/technology/personaltech/21techtipwebART/21techtipwebART-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=c93f7ce9e56785bb0033c8739e1d55f6059ac66cfd47365929c1154ab4520a24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Instagram's IGTV platform allows vertical videos up to 60 minutes long.

Science,What Is a Genetically Modified Crop? A European Ruling Sows Confusion,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/27/science/gmo-europe-crops.html,"A wheat field in Mouchamps, France. There are very few genetically modified crops grown in Europe compared to the United States.





Mushrooms that don't brown. Wheat that fights off disease. Tomatoes with a longer growing season. All of these crops are made possible by a gene-editing technology called Crispr-cas9. But now its future has been clouded by the European Union's top court. This week, the court ruled that gene-edited crops are genetically modified organisms, and therefore must comply with the tough regulations that apply to plants made with genes from other species. Many scientists responded to the decision with dismay, predicting that countries in the developing world would follow Europe's lead, blocking useful gene-edited crops from reaching farms and marketplaces. The ruling may also curtail exports from the United States, which has taken a more lenient view of gene-edited foods. ""You're not just affecting Europe, you're affecting the world with this decision,"" said Matthew Willmann, the director of the Plant Transformation Facility at Cornell University.

But the ruling also raises a more fundamental question: What does it actually mean for a crop to be genetically modified? In its decision, the European Union court exempted crops produced through older methods of altering DNA, saying they were not genetically modified organisms. That assertion left many scientists scratching their heads. ""I don't know why they are doing that,"" said Jennifer Kuzma, an expert in genetic engineering at North Carolina State University. ""I was thinking, 'Do they have the right science advice?'"" Since the agricultural revolution 10,000 years ago, all crop breeding has come down to altering the genetic composition of plants. For centuries, farmers selected certain plants to breed, or crossed varieties, hoping to pass useful traits to future generations. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] In the early 20th century, scientists discovered genes and invented new ways to breed crops. Two lines of corn, for example, could be melded into hybrid plants that were superior to either parent.

By the 1920s, researchers realized that they didn't have to content themselves with amplifying the genetic variations that already existed in plants. They could create new mutations. To do so, they fired X-rays at plants or used chemicals that disrupted plant DNA. Mutagenesis, as this method came to be known, introduced random mutations into plants. Scientists inspected the mutants to find those that were improvements. Thousands of plant breeds in use today, from strawberries to barley, are the product of mutagenesis. In the 1970s, microbiologists figured out how to insert genes from humans and other species into bacteria. Plant scientists later used recombinant DNA, as the technology came to be known, to develop methods for inserting genes into plants to improve their growth.

The plants might escape farmers' fields and spread through wild ecosystems, for instance, perhaps hybridizing with wild plants and introducing their genes into new species. Environmental groups also raised the possibility that genetically modified crops could harm human health. Genetically modified crops not only produce proteins from their own genes, but from the genes of other species, as well. On opposite sides of the Atlantic, the conflict has played out in very different ways. In the United States, the National Academy of Sciences has found no evidence to confirm that these crops are any more dangerous than conventionally bred ones. While the government has put in place a number of regulations governing genetically modified crops, the industry has boomed. Over 185 million acres of these crops were planted in the United States in 2017. In Europe, by contrast, concerns about genetically modified organisms led the European Union to issue a directive in 2001. From the early stages of research to the marketplace, these products would have to pass a series of tests for environmental risks and human safety. But the directive made it clear that crops made through older forms of mutagenesis were not genetically modified organisms because they were ""conventional"" and had ""a long safety record."" The result of the directive has been that Europe grows almost no genetically modified crops. In 2017, only 325,000 acres were planted across the continent.

In the years after the E.U.'s directive came out, science advanced beyond recombinant DNA. Rather than inserting a gene from another species, researchers learned to snip out piece of a plant's DNA, or even rewrite short stretches of genetic material. Instead of inserting foreign genes, scientists were able to edit a plant's own DNA in new ways. They could create crops that make more, or fewer, proteins from their own genes, gaining advantageous traits. When scientists first started experimenting with gene editing on crops, the European Union offered no clear guidance. In 2015, a French agricultural union and allies such as Friends of the Earth went to court to have gene-edited crops labeled as genetically modified organisms -- and regulated as such. And now the court has agreed. In a statement, the court said gene-edited crops were GMOs ""within the meaning of the G.M.O. Directive."" Dana Perls, the senior food and agriculture campaigner at Friends of the Earth, praised the court for recognizing gene editing as genetic modification. ""We need to call it what it is,"" she said. Ms. Perls said that Crispr and other new methods for tinkering with plant DNA raise concerns about safety, just as recombinant DNA did. ""Gene-editing technologies have unintended consequences,"" she said. Ms. Perls pointed to some scientific journal articles that describe how Crispr and other forms of gene editing can miss their targets, accidentally altering other stretches of DNA in an organism.

Strictly speaking, however, the United States stance also is contradictory. Crops created with recombinant DNA are said to be genetically modified organisms, because genes have been inserted into their DNA. Yet tinkering with a plant's DNA with Crispr is apparently not genetic modification, because these crops ""are indistinguishable from those developed through traditional breeding methods,"" according to a U.S.D.A. statement issued in March. Dr. Wolt said that the only way to escape these contradictions would be for government regulators to stop focusing on mutagenesis, recombinant DNA, Crispr and other methods for making new crops. ""It's the products we should be concerned with,"" he said. ""As soon as we solve this problem favorably or unfavorably for Crispr, there's going to be a new technology that comes along and we're going to have the same problem again.""","In Europe, plants created with gene-editing technologies will be stringently regulated as G.M.O.'s. But older crops whose DNA has been altered will be left alone.",e5a7e2ce-3d4b-54aa-826b-7b38d19b4b65,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/28/opinion/28gene-01/28gene-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9ade5315b30f54e9256c895e9e38a117e01f59cac15e7aff76d52dc779b78c68&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A wheat field in Mouchamps, France.

Sports,"For Kevin Durant, a Rush to Return Had No Upside",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/10/sports/basketball/marc-stein-newsletter.html,"Want more basketball in your inbox? Sign up for Marc Stein's weekly N.B.A. newsletter here. Wednesday marks a full, wild year since Kevin Durant went, in an instant, from unleashing a crossover dribble on the right wing against Serge Ibaka in the N.B.A. finals to hobbling to the sideline with a torn Achilles' tendon in his right leg. The stunning injury, combined with Klay Thompson's torn left anterior cruciate ligament three days later, helped seal the Golden State Warriors' finals loss to the Toronto Raptors after three titles in the previous four seasons. A few weeks later, Durant committed to sign with the Nets in free agency and, despite vowing to sit out his entire first season as a Net to recover, received assurances from U.S.A. Basketball officials that they would keep a roster spot open for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics in case he had sufficiently healed. The wildest twist, of course, came when those Olympics were postponed until 2021 by a global pandemic that also suddenly gave Durant the unprecedented option of playing for the Nets in July and August. Durant, though, is in no hurry -- not in his struggle to conquer the injury N.B.A. players dread most. There was an inevitable clamor, as the N.B.A. inched closer to a reboot of the 2019-20 season in recent weeks, for Durant to make his comeback at Walt Disney World Resort, since Tokyo was no longer an option. Yet as he confirmed on Friday to my longtime colleague Marc J. Spears from The Undefeated, Durant remains intent on waiting for the 2020-21 season to make his return.

""It gives me more time to get ready for next season and the rest of my career,"" Durant told Spears of his strategy. That is unquestionably the smartest strategy. There is no upside to Durant altering his timetable. Why would he or the Nets want to rush into the unknown of what may be the most unwelcoming environment in league history? Why place so much importance on a season that will surely be labeled by some within the league, as well as historians on the outside, as not being a true continuation of the 2019-20 campaign that was suddenly halted on March 11 by the coronavirus outbreak? Durant won back-to-back championships and consecutive finals Most Valuable Player Awards in his first two seasons as a Warrior. Still, those honors did not make his legacy universally sparkle, as he might have hoped after his polarizing decision to leave Oklahoma City for the Bay Area in the summer of 2016. So now why expect Durant to play sooner than he or his new team had planned in the overly optimistic view that he might lead the 30-34 Nets to theoretical title glory that, six weeks before the season even restarts, is already generating frequent debates over its legitimacy? The Nets, mind you, aren't a title contender as currently constituted -- even if Kyrie Irving were healthy.

Irving, remember, had season-ending shoulder surgery in early March. And Durant, who also tested positive for the coronavirus in March, hasn't played for 12 months because of his Achilles' tendon tear in Toronto -- an injury that has prevented virtually every previous N.B.A. victim, with the notable exception of Dominique Wilkins in the early 1990s, from returning to their past form. The fastest recovery from a torn Achilles' tendon over the past 15 seasons, according to data maintained by Jeff Stotts at InStreetClothes.com, was by Wesley Matthews, who debuted for the Dallas Mavericks in October 2015, 231 days after he tore the tendon while playing with the Portland Trail Blazers. Kobe Bryant, at age 34, was sidelined for 241 days after sustaining an Achilles tear in the Los Angeles Lakers' third-to-last game of the 2012-13 regular season. So the timetable, for some, suggests Durant should pack for Disney World without hesitation. But Durant, 31, isn't trying to win a rehab race. He wants to not only be the first Achilles' patient since Wilkins, then 32, to reclaim his All-Star status but also to re-establish himself as the game's most lethal scorer. The wisest path is to stay methodical and try to be uber-prepared to start next season in high gear -- when LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, Kawhi Leonard and the rest of Durant's top-shelf contemporaries will be emerging from the shortest off-season ever. In his interview with Spears, Durant spoke of ""putting pressure on myself"" during past injury absences ""to hurry up and come back."" Much of Durant's current recovery work has taken place in Southern California, in part to give him some distance from the Nets and from that type of thinking. ""I had to reset and totally focus on just me and what I wanted out of this thing,"" Durant told Spears. ""For the first time, I felt like I was in my own space rehabbing. ""I could really take my time and focus on myself each and every day."" With two more guaranteed years on his Nets contract, that is precisely where Durant's focus should be. Taking a long-term view is best for the Nets, too, no matter where you stand on the merits of an N.B.A. postseason that will be played at a centralized site with no fans, no travel and increased injury risk for many players after an abrupt three-month break. They simply aren't ready to challenge the elite now.

Loud, overt intensity -- one of Kevin Garnett's specialties -- is often equated with ""competitiveness,"" but the reality is that it's not fair to measure that characteristic strictly through reputation or noise. I can't forget what Kobe Bryant told me after Tim Duncan announced his retirement in July 2016. Duncan was ""more cutthroat than people give him credit for,"" Bryant said. ""I loved everything about him on the court."" Visible intensity obviously helps in some cases. Houston's Russell Westbrook, who so often plays angry, would have to be considered among the most competitive active players. The player Houston dealt to Oklahoma City to acquire Westbrook -- Chris Paul -- is right there with him. Milwaukee's Giannis Antetokounmpo and Miami's Jimmy Butler are two more elite players regularly associated with ferocity, but such assessments, as we should have learned by watching Duncan rack up five championships with a demeanor unlike anyone mentioned so far, are not simple. Portland's Damian Lillard, Golden State's Klay Thompson and Toronto's Kyle Lowry are three examples of rugged competitors, but none generate much hype in this category. The Los Angeles Clippers' Kawhi Leonard, of course, might be the best example of understated ruthlessness among active players. Q: The sad part is I've been conditioned to be more excited about the Knicks' off-seasons than anything they've done in-season for some years now. -- @chewbaka1963 from Twitter Stein: No question was posed in this response to my recent tweet about the Knicks' looming coaching search. This reply had the tone of an apology for rooting for the Knicks to be excluded from the N.B.A.'s return so the search could begin in earnest. But apologies are unnecessary. It's natural, with new front-office leadership, to allow yourself to get swept up in the hope for change after the Knicks' seventh consecutive season without a playoff berth.

Moving on as quickly as possible is an inevitable wish for a fan base that has mostly known misery since the team's defeat to San Antonio in the 1999 N.B.A. finals. This season, abbreviated or not, is bound to be remembered for another extended stretch of dysfunction for the James L. Dolan-owned fallen giants, including the curiously timed ousters of Coach David Fizdale and the team president Steve Mills, Dolan's dispute with Spike Lee and multiple instances in which the sad state of the franchise inspired loud ""Sell The Team"" chants at Madison Square Garden. The trouble, of course, is that we still know so little about what Leon Rose plans to do as Mills's successor. Far bigger problems have obviously emerged all over the world since Rose was named to the post on March 2, but the fact remains that he has yet to share with Knicks fans even a hint of his vision for running the team -- or the challenges he faces as a longtime player agent with zero front-office experience -- after 99 days on the job. Rose has hired three senior executives to bolster the organization's personnel department (Brock Aller, Walt Perrin and Frank Zanin) and extended Scott Perry's stay as general manager for at least one more year. Now, with the Knicks' exclusion from the 22-team field official, Rose is poised to begin a coaching search that is widely expected to install Tom Thibodeau as Fizdale's full-time replacement -- with Mike Miller, the interim coach, likely to be handed a new role in the organization. Yet the silence persists. Q: Can I offer a possible solution to provide some measure of home-court advantage when the 22 teams show up in July to play out the season at a single site? If the ""home"" team, on a neutral court, is down by 4 points or fewer at the end of regulation, it would still force the game to overtime. The final score in regulation would stand, though, if the ""away"" team is within four points at the buzzer. This could restore the home-court advantage that higher-seeded teams worked so hard during the regular season to earn. -- Reed Resnikoff. Stein: It's certainly not the most outlandish suggestion of the month. It's also far better than the proposal to let teams bring their own hardwood. The assembly and disassembly of individual team floors would require extra time and manpower -- neither of which fits within the N.B.A.'s aim to keep the planned Disney World bubble as tightly controlled as possible. But I really don't see any of the proposals that have been circulating in recent days to try to replicate some semblance of home-court advantage gaining any traction. In pretty much every case, it sounds like a step (or more) too far. With no fans allowed in the stands, no travel involved and the longest layoff from full-speed basketball that most N.B.A. players have ever experienced, the league's 22-team format to reboot the season is already unlike anything the N.B.A. has ever witnessed. All of that works against concepts like yours gaining support, because the league is already sensitive to the notion that this postseason will look too untraditional.

Last week's list of the N.B.A.'s head coaches of color inexcusably omitted Charlotte's James Borrego, who is Hispanic. Miami's Erik Spoelstra is Filipino-American, and there are eight African-American head coaches: J.B. Bickerstaff (Cleveland), Dwane Casey (Detroit), Alvin Gentry (New Orleans), Nate McMillan (Indiana), Lloyd Pierce (Atlanta), Doc Rivers (Los Angeles Clippers), Jacque Vaughn (Nets) and Monty Williams (Phoenix). Wednesday is the one-year anniversary of Kevin Durant tearing his right Achilles' tendon in Game 5 of the N.B.A. finals. In each of the past two seasons, four players have sustained a torn Achilles' tendon, which has historically been the hardest injury to recover from for N.B.A. players. According to data maintained by Jeff Stotts -- a certified athletic trainer who writes about sports injuries on his site, In Street Clothes -- going into the 2018-19 season there had only been four torn Achilles' tendons sustained by N.B.A. players over the previous three seasons. The seven other players, alongside Durant, who sustained Achilles' tendon tears last season and this season with when the injury occurred in parentheses: Indiana's C.J. Wilcox (September 2018), Dallas' J.J. Barea (January 2019), Washington's John Wall (January 2019), New Orleans' Darius Miller (August 2019), Portland's Rodney Hood (December 2019), the Nets' David Nwaba (December 2019) and Dallas' Dwight Powell (January 2020). The maximum number of games any of the 22 teams bound for the N.B.A.'s planned reboot of the 2019-20 season at the Walt Disney World Resort would most likely play is 36 -- with games scheduled over just 73 days (July 31 to Oct. 12). That number would stretch to 38 if a No. 9 seed in either conference forced a play-in round by finishing four games or fewer behind the No. 8 seed.","The Nets star might be healthy enough to play this summer, but his decision to focus on being as healthy as possible for next season is the right one.",45ebdec5-e90c-56a8-b669-acf7a8349ec6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/11/sports/09stein-newsletter/merlin_170707170_33cdb154-90a3-45d7-8d6c-8ed5fa981562-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ead8da0c43c8cf3760056049e51936cbefe515b3189763b7bafdf5adf517bd2a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kevin Durant, who has been rehabbing in Southern California, watching the Nets play the Lakers in March.",45ebdec5-e90c-56a8-b669-acf7a8349ec6,N24News/imgs/45ebdec5-e90c-56a8-b669-acf7a8349ec6.jpg,9
Television,"'Star Trek: Discovery' Season 2, Episode 6: A Better Saru",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/22/arts/television/star-trek-discovery-recap.html,"Evolution can come in many forms. Physical. Emotional. Mental. Societal. Saru brings it all in the latest episode ""Star Trek: Discovery,"" a self-contained, efficient and compelling chapter of an uneven season. It's not a coincidence that once again, Doug Jones is at the center of several of the show's best scenes. In ""The Sounds of Thunder,"" Saru is compassionate, angry, confident, defiant and reflective. What he is not: fearful, because he has survived vahar'ai. And Jones rises to the occasion. Much as Brent Spiner did with Data's quest to become more human on ""Star Trek: The Next Generation,"" he shows us that evolution comes with bumps. We learn that the red signals have appeared over Kaminar, the home planet of the Kelpiens and the Ba'ul. The Ba'ul have, essentially, maintained control over Saru's people for many years because the Kelpiens used to be the predator species, and the Ba'ul fear that an evolved Kelpien is a malicious one. The Discovery goes to investigate, and Saru visibly and uncharacteristically shows anger at Pike for amenably communicating with the Ba'ul and not initially sending him to the planet. (There is also an amusingly passive-aggressive moment early in the episode when Saru forgets to get up from the captain's chair when Pike enters the bridge.)

Saru goes to the planet and reunites with Siranna (excellent work here by Hannah Spear), who is both overjoyed to see her brother and fearful, as Kelpiens typically are, that Saru's presence will upset the Great Balance. Saru, of course, knows the Great Balance is a fraud and a ploy to keep Kelpiens subjugated. But Siranna knows nothing of the outside world and thought Saru had been dead all these years. Eventually, Saru beams over to a Ba'ul ship, where he is once again on death's door. He hulks up and becomes Super Saru, then breaks out of his chains to save a suddenly imperiled Siranna; meanwhile, the entirety of the Kelpien race goes through vahar'ai to lose their fears. What I am a little unclear about: Are the Ba'ul a bunch of people? Are they the, uh, blob-type thing we see threatening Saru, which looks like Venom from ""Spider Man""? Of course, the evolution of the Kelpiens is problematic for the Ba'ul, so they try to pull off a bit of genocide for self-preservation. It doesn't work. The biggest plot twist of the episode comes when the Red Angel shows up to do ... something. The big reveal is that the Red Angel, whatever or whoever it is, might be a benevolent force. One thing is for sure, as the Discovery finds out. These sightings aren't random. Spock, Burnham and now Saru have come into contact with it. In all three situations, the Red Angel has been used to save lives. Even still, the Federation believes it is a dangerous force, whatever it is, as Tyler from Section 31 makes clear at the end of the episode.

The episode worked for me. It was ambitious and tightly-written, and it showcased a character that has been deserving of the spotlight.
* We're six episodes in, and we still don't have any idea what's going on with Spock. Even though I really enjoyed this episode, we are pretty far-off track from the mystery that was introduced in the first two episodes -- two of the best of the series so far.
* Trouble in paradise for Culber and Stamets? Culber seems to blanch a bit when Stamets touches him early in the episode.
* Captain Pike is, by far, the most tolerant and patient captain we've seen at the center of a ""Star Trek"" series. He consistently listens to his subordinates, is an advocate for his crew and doesn't make rash decisions. You can see why he eventually (at least according to traditional Trek canon) becomes an admiral.","In the latest episode of ""Star Trek: Discovery,"" Saru helps his people become self-aware.",320d2857-dd46-56ee-b227-24b8380bef4b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/02/23/arts/television/23startrekdiscoveryrecap/23startrekdiscoveryrecap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=aa56c19f7a775540881e54aad5d0ad18553fd715287553206897b02ee71d97ef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Doug Jones in ""Star Trek: Discovery.""",320d2857-dd46-56ee-b227-24b8380bef4b,N24News/imgs/320d2857-dd46-56ee-b227-24b8380bef4b.jpg,3
Health,Obamacare Faces Unprecedented Test as Economy Sinks,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/27/health/coronavirus-obamacare-unemployment-health-coverage.html,"The Affordable Care Act, the landmark health law that has been a subject of caustic debate for more than a decade, is being tested as never before, as millions of Americans lose their jobs and medical coverage in the midst of the nation's gravest health crisis in a century. The law is offering a vast majority of newly unemployed people a path to stopgap health coverage, providing a cushion that did not exist during the last crushing recession -- or ever before. But the crisis has also highlighted fundamental weaknesses with its patchwork system -- ones magnified by Republican efforts to undermine and dismantle it, but also seized on by some Democrats pushing for a sweeping overhaul. On Thursday, as the coronavirus pandemic surged and the country reported a daily record in new virus cases, the Trump administration continued the Republican Party's push to abolish the law. Shortly before midnight, the Justice Department filed a brief asking the Supreme Court to overturn the law, in a case brought by a group of Republican attorneys general. The case is likely to be argued this fall during the closing stages of a bitter presidential election in which health care is certain to be a galvanizing issue. Joseph R. Biden Jr., the presumptive Democratic nominee, continues to support improving and expanding the A.C.A. with an option to buy a public plan, rather than replacing it with a ""Medicare for all"" system preferred by many in the left wing of the party.

As those political and legal battles play out, how the law actually works in the coming months of intense need could go a long way toward determining its durability and future. ""This is the first test of the A.C.A. in an economic downturn,"" said Peter V. Lee, the executive director of Covered California, the state's insurance marketplace created under the law. ""But it's not just a test -- it's a national study of what happens in states that implemented the A.C.A. as opposed to those that didn't."" Four out of every five people who have lost employer-provided health insurance during the coronavirus pandemic are eligible for free coverage through expanded Medicaid programs or government-subsidized private insurance, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan health research group. And many jobless 20-somethings have been able to join their parents' plans. All three options were made possible by the law. Yet others have fallen through the holes in the law's safety net. Nearly three million low-income people are ineligible for assistance in the 14 states that have declined to expand Medicaid under the law, including Texas, Florida and others, mostly in the South, where coronavirus cases are now spiking. Many people who have qualified for government subsidies to buy private plans still face unaffordable co-pays and deductibles. David Exum, of Kannapolis, N.C., has experienced both the benefits and the shortcomings of the law. He lost his health coverage when he was laid off from his job as a web content coordinator in March. He is now paying just $1 a month for a subsidized plan.

It is a big improvement from the last recession, he said, when he became uninsured for several years after losing his job and getting divorced. But for Mr. Exum, 53, the law is imperfect. His plan is cheap because it has a high deductible -- $6,900 a year. Worse, if his unemployment benefits expire before he finds a new job, and his income drops below the poverty line, he will lose his premium subsidies and will no longer be able to afford the plan. But because of a quirk in the law, he would not be eligible for Medicaid in that situation, because North Carolina has not expanded the program to cover many low-income men. ""I know there are millions in the same boat,"" said Mr. Exum, who has been walking a mile or two a day to stay healthy during the pandemic. ""It's just really scary."" The strange glitch exists because the law originally required all states to expand Medicaid, and thus did not set up a system of subsidies for the poorest Americans to buy private coverage. The Supreme Court ultimately ruled that states could opt out of expanding Medicaid, but Congress, bitterly divided over the law, never fixed the glitch. ""The pandemic has exposed some of the glaring weaknesses in the A.C.A.,"" said Paul Starr, a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton who served as a health policy adviser to the Clinton administration. ""When millions of workers lose their jobs, most of them also lose their health coverage, and the A.C.A. does not provide for any automatic backup or means of transferring coverage to a publicly subsidized alternative."" ""To be sure, we are better off with the A.C.A. than without it,"" Mr. Starr added, ""but we ought to be prepared to go beyond it and create a system that doesn't leave so many Americans in the lurch."" The A.C.A. brought the country's uninsured rate down to record lows several years after it was enacted in 2010, but even before the pandemic some 28 million people had no coverage. Still, an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated that 27 million Americans could have lost job-based health coverage between March and May, and that a vast majority of them -- 79 percent -- are eligible for new coverage from Medicaid or subsidized private plans.

In the 36 states that expanded Medicaid, the Kaiser analysis predicted that 14 million people would qualify for the free program and another 3.5 million would qualify for subsidized A.C.A. plans. Some states are already seeing spikes in Medicaid enrollment -- in May alone, enrollment jumped by 8.4 percent in Minnesota and by 8.2 percent in Kentucky, according to the Georgetown Center for Children and Families -- and experts anticipate bigger jumps, straining state budgets, in the coming months. So far, during the pandemic, nearly 800,000 people have signed up for new private plans through the law's marketplaces. In Boise, Idaho, Jeremy Bratsman was laid off from his job as a regional manager in January, and was still searching for work when the economy started shutting down in March. Mr. Bratsman, 43, has Type 1 diabetes; a few years ago, he paid $15,000 for insulin and other supplies over the course of a year while uninsured. Now, though, he qualifies for Medicaid with his wife and four sons because Idaho expanded the program in January. ""I've talked to other uninsured diabetics,"" his wife, Rebecca Bratsman, said. ""And when they are in one of those states that hasn't expanded, I just tell them to move. They don't have any option.""

In states that do not run their own A.C.A. marketplaces, Republican efforts to weaken the law have made enrollment in new private plans during the pandemic more challenging. For example, the Trump administration all but eliminated funding for outreach in those states, including grants to nonprofit organizations that help people enroll in new coverage. Anyone who becomes uninsured after losing a job is eligible to sign up for a marketplace plan for 60 days afterward, but the administration has done little to raise awareness. Morgan Childers, of Cullowhee, N.C., tried navigating the federal marketplace's website, HealthCare.gov, after she lost her job at a university in late March. Her income was low enough to qualify for premium subsidies, but she did not figure that out and mistakenly thought her cheapest option would cost $610 a month.

So Ms. Childers, 30, signed up for Cobra, which lets laid-off workers stay on their former employer's health plan for 18 months under federal law, but requires them to pay the full cost unless the employer chooses to help. She is paying $560 a month -- substantially more than a subsidized plan would cost at her income level, and an amount she will not be able to afford for long. She has several autoimmune conditions, and without insurance, would owe at least $3,000 a month just for her oral medications; she also gets regular infusions that cost even more. ""If my unemployment runs out and I don't have a job,"" she said, ""I don't know what I'll do."" In contrast, most of the 13 states that operate their own A.C.A. marketplaces not only opened enrollment to everyone during the pandemic, but worked hard to publicize the option. In California, where the special enrollment period started on March 15 and was recently extended through the end of July, the marketplace devoted $9 million to advertising the opportunity, including two television spots. People on unemployment get a flyer advertising the marketplace with every check, and dozens of community groups help people enroll. So far, more than 175,000 have done so. In the District of Columbia, where the special enrollment period will extend through September, the marketplace is contacting businesses that are cutting jobs to offer affected employees help applying for Medicaid or premium subsidies. In Maryland, where the marketplace just extended its special enrollment period through July 15, people can check a box on their tax form to find out if they are eligible for free or subsidized coverage. A new report from the Trump administration said that, by the end of May, about 487,000 people who had lost their job-based coverage had signed up through the federal marketplace. Unlike during the last recession, many employers are trying to maintain coverage for workers whom they have furloughed or laid off, hoping they can bring them back when the economy improves. About half of employers, asked in an April survey whether they planned to continue paying for health benefits for furloughed employees, said they would for a month or longer, according to an informal survey from Mercer, a benefits consultant. There are no estimates of how many newly jobless people have enrolled in Cobra. Many employers are pushing Congress to pay people's premiums under Cobra during the pandemic so workers can keep the coverage they had through work. Proponents -- including Republican opponents of the Affordable Care Act -- say the idea is gaining momentum and could be included in the next coronavirus legislation. The latest estimate for the cost of covering the premiums in full is $98 billion.

But House Democrats are also pushing an alternative: a bill that would increase federal premium subsidies to buy plans through the A.C.A. marketplaces and make them available to people who earn more than 400 percent of the poverty level, the current cutoff for assistance. The legislation mirrors what Mr. Biden has proposed. It has no chance of passing the Republican-controlled Senate, but Democrats hope it will bolster their election-year case against Mr. Trump and other Republicans. Even before the pandemic, one out of every 10 people in the United States had no health insurance, despite the uninsured rate reaching a record low in 2016. They included undocumented immigrants and those in the Medicaid coverage gap, but also people whose income was too high to qualify for marketplace subsidies or who could not afford even a subsidized plan. Brian Golembiewski, 47, who works for a land brokerage company in Ludington, Mich., said he could not afford the insurance through his job or a subsidized A.C.A. plan for his wife and himself. ""I like that they made an effort with Obamacare,"" he said, ""but it fell way short.""",The battles over the health law have played out during a decade of continuous economic growth.

Fashion & Style,On the Auction Block: The Pull of Celebrity,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/fashion/audrey-hepburn-mario-testino-auctions.html,"LONDON -- Must-see collections will not be limited to the runways of the four fashion capitals this fall. September will also play host to a trio of high-profile auctions that put the private artworks and personal possessions of three tastemakers with strong ties to the fashion world under the hammer. Sotheby's is set to hold two major sales: The first, in London on Sept. 13, will be composed of photographs, paintings and sculpture owned by the Peruvian fashion photographer Mario Testino, known for his Vogue covers and Princess Diana portraits. The second, on Sept. 27, will be held in New York and showcase contemporary art and design pieces that belonged to Santiago Gonzalez, who died earlier this year; he was the president and creative director of the Colombian accessories powerhouse Nancy Gonzalez. Also on Sept. 27, and back in London, Christie's will hold a sale of over 300 items owned by Audrey Hepburn, including wardrobe staples, film scripts and personal letters. An accompanying online auction will run from Sept 17. to Oct 3.

""More and more people like to see a sense of individual character coming through and to identify private passions from works,"" he said. ""In the iPhone era, we have all become collectors of images, in a way. And particularly with living creatives like Mario, the immediacy of access to his life and work appears to have made him even more covetable."" For Mr. Testino, the decision to put the items up for sale stemmed from a desire to generate fresh funding for his museum, Museo MATE, in Lima, Peru. Titled ""Shake It Up,"" the sale is of works he amassed over the past 30 years traveling the world for shoots. He began, he said, with a focus on early- and mid-20th-century photography; his appetite broadened along with his bank balance. ""The moment I made some money in the 1980s, I started collecting,"" Mr. Testino said. ""First it was vintage photography by some of my heroes. Then it evolved into contemporary photography, and then contemporary art. We are always changing, therefore what we want to live with must also change.""

Highlights include pieces by artists and photographers including Vanessa Beecroft, Olafur Eliasson, Nan Goldin, Florian Maier-Aichen, Richard Prince and Wolfgang Tillmans (some of the top lots are cited below). ""It was difficult to make the selection for the sale. I felt like I was seeing my children leave home,"" Mr. Testino said. ""Nearly all of these pieces I have lived with. But I still own work by nearly every artist in the auction. And when I made the choices I kept thinking that the more I put in, the more we'd be able to help people, children and artists in Peru."" For the family of Mr. Gonzalez, who died unexpectedly in March at the age of 40, the sale is bittersweet. Known within the fashion world as an avid art collector, he was, said Emily Kaplan, the head of Sotheby's Contemporary Curated department, ""a real Peter Pan-like figure."" This is illustrated by the pieces in ""Neither Appearance Nor Illusion: Property From the Collection of Santiago Barberi Gonzalez,"" part of the larger Contemporary Curated series that Sotheby's holds each year. The lot will feature 74 works by such names as Antony Gormley, Ed Ruscha, Claude Lalanne and Fernando and Humberto Campana, with an expected price range from about $250 to $400,000. ""I think the consensus was that we wanted everyone to have a chance to buy a piece of Santiago's collection,"" Ms. Kaplan said. ""He collected with an amazing amount of passion and knowledge, and the works reflect both the cerebral and playful sides of his much-missed personality."" Many of the pieces deal with the topic of displacement in space and time, she noted. But alongside those works are finger and nail objects, and charming little wooden crocodile toys, synonymous with Mr. Gonzalez's Colombian home.

""That he lived so vibrantly among all these works, and that he chose them personally, gives them a real power and presence,"" Ms. Kaplan said. The hope that prospective buyers will pay handsomely for the private props of a person's history is shared by the curators responsible for Christie's Audrey Hepburn sale. Ms. Hepburn died in 1993, and many of the pieces -- film scripts for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""Charade"" (personally annotated in turquoise ink), Valentino couture, an engraved gold cigarette lighter and instantly recognizable photographs by the likes of Cecil Beaton -- have never been available to the public before. ""There have been Audrey Hepburn sales in the past, but this is the first to have come directly from her family,"" said Adrian Hume-Sayer, Christie's director of private collections. Standout pieces from Ms. Hepburn's closet, he said, include the blue satin Givenchy cocktail dress she wore in a photograph promoting the 1967 film ""Two for the Road"" (estimate: $11,000 to $17,000); a long tan Burberry trench coat (estimate: $6,700 to $9,000); and her signature colorful ballet flats (estimate: $1,700).

""Unlike other stars of that era, Audrey's sense of style still feels very accessible and modern -- she is the definition of a timeless icon,"" Mr. Hume-Sayer said. ""And because she is still so beloved, and her look is still so ingrained in the public consciousness, her family were keen to make these particular pieces available to those who loved her. So many parts of her life are in this sale. It is a once-in-a-lifetime event.""

Sports,Jon Rahm's Two New Attributes: Composure and a Top Ranking,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/19/sports/golf/jon-rahm-penalty-memorial-tournament-score.html,"Jack Nicklaus, in blazer, and Jon Rahm eschewed the traditional handshake for fist bumps on Sunday at the Memorial Tournament. Nicklaus revealed that he and his wife, Barbara, tested positive for the coronavirus in March.





DUBLIN, Ohio -- Sometimes a reputation is hard to shake. Just ask Jon Rahm, who for years was best known as a good golfer with a bad temper. But on Sunday evening, Rahm became renowned for being something else: the world's new No. 1 ranked golfer. Rahm's fits of pique on the PGA Tour were the stuff of legend when he turned pro four years ago after a decorated amateur career, with clubs kicked and thrown, a tee marker punched and a bunker rake irately flung over one shoulder. And that was the scene from just one round in 2017. Rahm apologized, although he never vowed to become stoic in the face of failure. The fury and disgust he sometimes felt was a necessary response, he said, even a catalyst that simply had to be channeled more productively -- and less publicly. He called reining in his impulses a process. The tantrums have been at a minimum lately, or reduced to brief moments of obvious exasperation, and in the past 18 months Rahm, 25, has climbed up the world rankings with 18 top-10 finishes. On Sunday, with a decisive, three-shot victory at the Memorial Tournament, Rahm vaulted into the top-ranked spot, supplanting Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy.

With his fourth PGA Tour victory, Rahm becomes the 24th player in history be to ranked No. 1 and just the second Spaniard, as he joins Seve Ballesteros, a boyhood hero of Rahm's who died in 2011. ""Being a part of golf history with Seve, in any way, is unbelievable,"" Rahm, who shot a 75 on Sunday to finish nine-under-par for the tournament, said afterward. ""It's a pretty unique feeling I'm going to enjoy for a while."" Of his work to regulate his on-the-course outbursts, Rahm said, ""I'm just trying to be like me."" Rahm weathered a two-stroke penalty on the 16th hole on Sunday for causing his ball to move slightly before a shot. After beginning the final round four shots ahead of Tony Finau and Ryan Palmer, Rahm had grown his lead to eight strokes. But bogies on the 10th and 14th holes, and a double bogey on the 11th hole, had whittled Rahm's lead over Palmer to three strokes.

Then, Rahm flew his tee shot over the par-3 16th green and into deep rough 31 feet from the hole. Rahm opened his wedge behind the ball and deftly pitched it just onto the putting surface, where it rolled into the hole for an apparent birdie that increased his lead over Palmer to four strokes, an edge that climbed to five strokes one hole later. However, video replays of Rahm placing his wedge behind his ball in the deep grass before his chip shot seemed to show the ball moving slightly. PGA Tour officials later assessed a two-stroke penalty, turning the birdie into a bogey.

After his round, and before learning of the two-stroke penalty, Rahm described his holed chip shot as ""the best short game shot I've ever hit."" After meeting with rules officials, Rahm said the video he viewed showed a slight oscillation of the ball in the grass. ""It barely moves at all,"" said Rahm, who added that when he was standing over the ball he did not see it move. ""But the rules of golf are clear. I accept the penalty. And it proves you have to fight to the end."" Coming off the final green at the Muirfield Village Golf Club, Rahm was greeted by the tournament host Jack Nicklaus, who has made it a tradition to shake hands with the Memorial winner as soon as the competition has ended. Nicklaus and Rahm instead bumped fists, a gesture that carried more import than usual, because earlier on Sunday Nicklaus revealed in a television interview that he and his wife, Barbara, tested positive for the coronavirus in March. Nicklaus said that Barbara had been asymptomatic and that he had been ill briefly but recovered quickly. The Nicklauses are both 80 years old. Rahm, meanwhile, was being complimented by his peers -- for his golf skill and for finding a way to control the rage that had consumed him in the past. ""Jon Rahm is a remarkable talent,"" said Phil Mickelson, who added that there was no weak part of Rahm's game. ""And he knows himself. He knows that to relax sometimes he has to let some of his anger out. He can't hold that in."" Mickelson added: ""It allows him to be at his best. That's a big thing, too, identifying your own self. He's done a great job of that at a really young age.""

Palmer, who shot 74 on Sunday, finished second. No other golfer made a serious run at the lead on a day with difficult, United States Open-like scoring conditions. Several days with temperatures in the 90s dried out the already challenging Muirfield Village greens, and swirling winds sent many approach shots into vexing greenside bunkers. Tiger Woods, playing in his first PGA Tour event since mid-February, concluded his final round hours before the tournament leaders finished. Woods's chance of contending ended on Friday when his surgically repaired back was so stiff it significantly inhibited his swing and caused Woods to shoot 76. He rebounded with a round of 71 on Saturday, but slumped on Sunday with another 76 to finish six-over-par for the tournament. Throughout the event, Woods's putting was subpar, and Sunday, when he had 32 putts, was his worst day of the event. But with his back not restricting him in the final round, Woods nonetheless left Muirfield Village feeling encouraged by his performance after a five-month PGA Tour layoff. ""It was nice to get my feet wet and compete and play again,"" Woods said. ""I need to work on my putting a bit and clean that up. But as far as my swing, it felt good. Over all for my first week back, it was a lot of positives."" But golf fans should not expect to see Woods on tour again until the P.G.A. Championship takes place Aug. 6 to 9 at T.P.C. Harding Park in San Francisco. Asked if he thought he would play in a tournament before the first week of August, Woods smiled and suggested that he needed many more practice rounds but not necessarily competitive ones.","With his win at the Memorial Tournament on Sunday, the previously petulant Rahm takes over the No. 1 world ranking.",684e5043-4fbd-5b18-98d2-188607ebd4dc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/sports/19golf-memorial-4/19golf-memorial-4-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=206a06d5c7344c267f27c24bda3192d39a24e8a437bdf692fcaa2f468d07314d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jack Nicklaus, in blazer, and Jon Rahm eschewed the traditional handshake for fist bumps on Sunday at the Memorial Tournament. Nicklaus revealed that he and his wife, Barbara, tested positive for the coronavirus in March.",684e5043-4fbd-5b18-98d2-188607ebd4dc,N24News/imgs/684e5043-4fbd-5b18-98d2-188607ebd4dc.jpg,9
Science,Small Worlds With Lava Oceans Might Have Given Us Meteorites,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/22/science/meteorites-chondrites-chondrules.html,"""Droplets of fiery rain."" That's how Henry Clifton Sorby, a 19th-century British mineralogist, described the tiny spheres called chondrules found within meteorites. Chondrules are such dominant features of these meteorites that they are called chondrites, and they account for 86 percent of meteorites that have been found on Earth.

""There's nothing that predicts them,"" said Rhian Jones of the University of Manchester in England, an expert in chondrites.

Now some scientists think they have a new answer to this rocky enigma: The chondrites may have formed in an unusual event during a narrow window of time in the early solar system. The findings, presented at a virtual meeting of the American Astronomical Society this month by William Herbst and James Greenwood of Wesleyan University in Connecticut, paint a strange picture of what parts of the solar system were like before the planets we know began to form.

Multiple hypotheses have been put forward for the origins of chondrites. Some agree their formation must have occurred early in the solar system's history, about 4.6 billion years ago. But each of these hypotheses has its downsides. To form, chondrules must be heated and then cooled rapidly, a scenario that is difficult to explain. So the researchers came up with a model for an idea they thought might work, then simulated the conditions with rocks in a lab furnace to test their hypothesis.",Researchers propose a new model to explain the formation of most of the meteorites that make it to Earth.,ea684772-3cce-5670-bab4-79c6780a55bc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/19/science/19TB-METEORITES2/merlin_173672094_cf5b9c43-b9a5-45b2-8872-80bb2b589100-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a35e654359e0d7c40935167249c6f7e238a8116814124544593ea6ef988a4e88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A section of chondrite meteorite found in India, known as the Semarkona meteorite.

Global Business,"After Quake in Japan, a Toyota Dealer Slowly Regains Its Footing",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/27/business/global/27dealer.html,"ISHINOMAKI, Japan -- As soon as the ground stopped bucking under the small Toyota dealer in this port city on March 11, the staff scattered to survey the quake's damage. Nothing drastic: cracks in the showroom walls, fallen display lights. Then came the deluge. A river of brown water and debris burst through the showroom's glass windows. As a van and two cars disappeared under the waves, the dealership's 22 employees raced up the stairs to the second floor -- and when the water rose further, to the roof. Still, in a town destroyed by a 15-foot tsunami, the Sendai Toyopet Ishinomaki dealership here reopened in just four days. ""In this part of the country, cars are a lifeline,"" Kunihiko Sudo, the dealership's manager, said this weekend. ""You need cars to get the economy moving again. We feel a sense of duty.""

Nearly seven weeks later, it is by no means business as usual. Cellphones fill in for landlines, and after-hours paperwork is completed by candlelight. Half of the dealership's makeshift office, above a now-empty showroom still stained with mud, is occupied by the family of an employee whose home was destroyed. Employees still talk in shock about watching the surge wash over the neighborhood, and how they used makeshift lifelines to tow a stranded family of six to safety. But now, in the tsunami-ravaged region of Japan, people need replacement vehicles as urgently as dealers can sell them. And the Sendai Toyopet dealership's recovery effort offers a glimpse into Japan's broader quest for something like a return to normalcy. Mr. Sudo recalled how the staff cheered when the dealership made its first post-tsunami delivery, a Prius, on April 1. Since then, Sendai Toyopet has sold more than six dozen vans and cars. Even as Japan's automakers struggle to restore their global supply and assembly operations, they are racing to meet demand from families needing to replace lost cars and businesses desperate to rebuild their damaged fleets.

Shipments are trickling into the worst-hit areas. On April 7, at the port of Shiogama in the heart of the disaster zone, a freighter delivered the first post-tsunami load of cars. Shiogama now receives car shipments almost every other day. Still, Japan's auto industry can go only so far toward meeting local demand while trying not to neglect its global customers. Toyota's plants in Japan are now working at only 50 percent of normal production levels, and Honda's factories are at similar levels. Nissan's plants are producing at only 40 percent. ""Much of what we can produce, we are sending into the afflicted areas,"" Shiro Nagai, a Nissan spokesman in Yokohama, said. ""At the same time, we are trying to revive operations up and down the supply chain, from suppliers to dealers."" Last week Toyota said it did not expect to return to normal production volumes before the end of the year. And on Tuesday, in a conference call with reporters, a Toyota executive said the company had only about two-and-a-half months' worth of finished vehicles in its global inventory and remained hampered by a shortage of about 150 critical parts. The ""most critical"" shortages include microprocessing units for computerized car controls, rubber items and paint additives, according to Atsushi Niimi, executive vice president for production. With production of new cars severely restricted, other Toyota dealers in Japan have rallied to help bring vehicles to the disaster region. Soon after the tsunami, a Toyota rent-a-car service in Kobe, the city hit by its own devastating earthquake in 1995, sent 15 cars and a shipment of emergency supplies to Sendai Toyopet.

""We didn't ask them in advance, because we knew they would be too modest to accept,"" Masahiro Morimoto, a company official in Kobe, said. ""We know, because we went through a similar experience,"" he said. A dealer in Kagawa, which was hit by a flood in 2009, reached Mr. Sudo with critical advice shortly after the tsunami: get second-hand cars ready, as there will be a surge in orders from people looking for quick replacements. Toyota is now helping 18 dealers, including Sendai Toyopet, procure second-hand cars from just south of the disaster zone, and has readied 850 vehicles so far, Paul Nolasco, a spokesman for the company, said. All second-hand cars bound for the tsunami zone have been shipped with a full tank of gas because of fuel shortages that remain in some areas, he said. ""We're focused on affordable, compact cars that are ready to go,"" he said. The company has also told dealers in the region that it will extend interest-free loans to finance repairs and other reconstruction work at their dealerships, though it has stopped short of offering direct financial assistance. The handful of employees who opened the dealership here in the early days after the tsunami were initially overwhelmed not with orders, but with pleas for help. Mangled cars lay everywhere across the city, belly-up in fields or even on top of buildings, and customers needed help in removing them, said Hideaki Bandai, a manager at Sendai Toyopet, which owns 20 dealerships in the disaster zone. ""Some people said their car had washed right into their living room, or had been found far away, or were blocking roads,"" Mr. Bandai said. The dealership dispatched teams to remove the cars, sometimes traveling to as many as 10 locations a day.",The Sendai Toyopet dealership's recovery effort offers a glimpse into Japan's broader quest for something like a return to normalcy.,07409396-14f7-5315-a200-d815fcf9a62c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/27/business/27DEALER_span/27DEALER-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=350&w=600&s=ecf8e7d1239780466bca33a41e0c0c5cccdc8ae165f1a3d9bc648ae8559d3e4d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"An employee of the Toyopet Sendai Ishinomaki dealership, which reopened four days after the earthquake and tsunami.",07409396-14f7-5315-a200-d815fcf9a62c,N24News/imgs/07409396-14f7-5315-a200-d815fcf9a62c.jpg,24
Art & Design,"At Cornell Tech, Art Engineered for the Imagination",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/13/arts/design/cornell-tech-art-roosevelt-island.html,"Since the first crop of engineering graduate students arrived last month at the brand-new Cornell Tech campus on Roosevelt Island, many have been busy decoding the diagrams in Matthew Ritchie's dynamic mural rising four stories in the atrium of the Emma and Georgina Bloomberg Center, the main academic building. This is not lobby decoration tacked on as an afterthought. From the early design stages, Thom Mayne, the founder of Morphosis Architects, and his team integrated the mural and four other immersive installations in the cafe and unexpected ""discovery rooms"" throughout the new building: an art program engineered to provoke creative thinking. ""The entire building is designed to spur imagination and innovation and sometimes unintentional interactions,"" said Patricia Harris, the chief executive of Bloomberg Philanthropies.

More than 1 percent of the building's overall budget of $130 million (funded by Bloomberg Philanthropies and the city) was invested in new artworks by Mr. Ritchie, Michael Riedel, Matthew Day Jackson and Alison Elizabeth Taylor, as well as in the restoration and relocation of a historic 50-foot-long mural by Ilya Bolotowsky. This canvas had hung in the Coler-Goldwater Memorial Hospital, which was razed to make way for the Cornell Tech campus.

Cornell University and Technion-Israel Institute of Technology formed the partnership of Cornell Tech in 2011 and won New York City's competition to develop an applied-sciences campus. As part of the deal, in which the city provided funding and land, Cornell Tech agreed to preserve three large-scale paintings in the derelict W.P.A.-era hospital. An Albert Swinden mural has been installed in the new Bridge building adjacent to the Bloomberg Center, and a Joseph Rugolo work will find a home in the next construction phase. The Bolotowsky canvas -- an abstract composition of geometric shapes in a soothing palette of blues, pinks and beiges -- had wrapped around a circular room in the hospital and required Mr. Mayne to accommodate a similar space in his floor plan. ""This helped us think about how we could have other hidden rooms as an element of surprise,"" Ms. Harris explained.

These enigmatic spaces include Mr. Jackson's ""Ordinary Objects of Extraordinary Beauty,"" a continuation of his series called ""Study Collections."" The small trapezoidal meeting room is lined with shelves displaying natural and found objects -- like bones, ceramics and branches -- as specimens. ""The things these students will dream up are at the cutting edge of the application of new science,"" Mr. Jackson said. ""I wanted to present a room where they could sit and think about the material resources available on earth and what they'll do with them."" The students will be unplugged while they're contemplating. Andrew Winters, the senior director for capital projects at Cornell Tech, said there are no outlets or wiring for electronic devices in the room, to encourage people to sit and talk. Part of the art program is to help students, faculty and researchers ""get away from what they're doing day to day,"" Mr. Winters said. ""Facebook and Pixar offices have secret rooms for people to go do yoga or sleep. We tried to elevate that a little bit.""

In another room, Ms. Taylor -- whose work updates the age-old decorative inlay technique called marquetry -- has imagined what Roosevelt Island might have looked like in the 19th century. Using more than 10,000 cut and painted pieces of wood, she has pieced together vivid panoramic scenes covering the walls of the triangular room. One side depicts a dense thicket of tree trunks. The other two walls portray an abandoned interior caving in at the corners, with vines creeping in, like tentacles, through a window.

Interested in the constant battle between human innovation and nature's overwhelming force, Ms. Taylor hopes that her piece, titled ""Reclamation,"" gives students ""perspective in this period of rapid technological change on how we've always adapted as a species."" While these three rooms are intended as intimate spaces for students to meet or retreat, the other two artist installations are meant to animate the busier areas. Known for using text as raw material, Mr. Riedel has created a black-and-white inkjet print on ceiling panels, titled ""Cornell Tech Mag,"" flowing overhead from the building's entrance through the cafe and then across the tabletops. Using what he calls ""the bible for computer technology,"" he rearranged every word in the first four volumes of Donald Knuth's ""The Art of Computer Programming"" into alphabetical order, then enlarged all the o's and l's. ""You can imagine it's like one and zero, or open and closed, or a circle and a line,"" explained Mr. Riedel, who was interested in the resulting abstracted pattern, covering some 5,000 square feet.

Mr. Ritchie's atrium piece, ""Everything That Rises Must Converge,"" is printed on an 80-foot-high resin wall and three adjoining glass walls ascending through the core of the building and visible from each landing. It was conceived as a kind of ""history of logical thinking,"" said the artist, who has often tackled epic themes. He wove together clouds of yellows and oranges with all manner of diagrams -- prototypes of the compass and the printing press, Charles Darwin's first sketch of the evolutionary tree of life, the first drawing of the internet -- superimposed with calligraphic markings that refer to an early experiment by Eratosthenes to approximate the diameter of the earth. Mr. Ritchie asked the faculty to contribute ideas for diagrams, reproducing a currently unsolved mathematical problem in computer science called the ""P versus NP problem."" Mr. Ritchie was warned that it is part of the culture at the Cornell campus in Ithaca to scrawl problems on glass walls as though they were whiteboards. The artist said he would welcome additions and thinks packets of pens should be left out. ""We write on the walls a lot,"" Mr. Winters said. ""Our engineering students like puzzles.""","From the early design stages, architects have integrated five immersive installations throughout the main academic building.

Education,"Last Teacher In, First Out? City Has Another Idea",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/25/education/25seniority.html,"Last Teacher In, First Out? City Has Another Idea

Peter Borock, 23, is in his second year teaching history at Health Opportunities High School in the South Bronx. It could be his last. With New York City schools planning for up to 8,500 layoffs, new teachers like Mr. Borock, and half a dozen others at his school, could be some of the ones most likely to be let go. That has led the schools chancellor, Joel I. Klein, into a high-stakes battle with the teachers' union to overturn seniority rules that have been in place for decades. Facing the likelihood of the largest number of layoffs in more than a generation, Mr. Klein and his counterparts around the country say that the rules, which require that the most recently hired teachers be the first to lose their jobs, are anachronistic. In an era of accountability, they say, the rules will upend their efforts of the last few years to recruit new teachers, improve teacher performance and reward those who do best. ""Nobody I've talked to thinks seniority is a rational way to go,"" Mr. Klein said. ""Obviously there are some senior teachers who are extraordinary. You recruit young talent you think is good for the future, and to just get rid of that by the numbers seems to me to be a nonsensical approach.""

This month city officials persuaded lawmakers in Albany to introduce a bill that would allow the city to decide which teachers to let go, although its chances of passing are slim. Similar legislation in California, where thousands of young teachers have received letters saying they could be out of work, moved forward last week, backed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. Arizona abolished seniority rules last year, and this month its Legislature banned the use of seniority if teachers are rehired. Unions argue that administrators want to do away with seniority protections so they can get rid of older teachers, who are more expensive. They say that without seniority safeguards, principals could act on personal grudges, and that while keeping the best teachers is a laudable goal, no one has figured out an accurate way to determine who those teachers are. ""There is no good way to lay people off,"" said Randi Weingarten, the former leader of the city's teachers' union, who is now the president of the American Federation of Teachers. ""But to be opportunistic and try to rush something through without knowing if there's some degree of objectivity and a comprehensive and valid evaluation system is appalling."" Indeed, even if school districts switched to performance-based layoffs, younger teachers could still face big losses.

Several studies have shown that teachers just beginning their careers are more likely to struggle than more experienced instructors. And a New York Times analysis of the city's own reports on teacher effectiveness suggest that teachers do best after being in the classroom for at least 5 years, though they tend to level off after 10 years. Ms. Raff is a teacher at River East Elementary in Manhattan. As many as 8,500 city teachers could be laid off this year. Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times ""You want to keep a rookie who looks good relative to other rookies, even if it's not that great relative to all other teachers, because they are going to turn into a really good teacher,"" said Douglas O. Staiger, an economics professor at Dartmouth who has worked with the city on teacher quality studies. ""The question is: Are our current methods good enough at figuring out who those teachers are? I'm not sure where you draw the line on that."" Mr. Klein frequently cites the teachers' contract in Washington, D.C., as a model. Last year, when the Washington schools chancellor, Michelle A. Rhee, laid off nearly 300 teachers, she was not bound by seniority. The fight to end seniority rules could be Mr. Klein's most uphill battle yet. He is fresh off a deal with the union to speed the process of firing teachers accused of wrongdoing or incompetence, including the ending of warehousing such teachers in what are known as rubber rooms. But he continues to struggle with the union over his desire to lay off so-called absent-teacher reserves, teachers whose positions have been eliminated because of school closings or classroom shifts, but who are entitled to full salaries because they have not done anything wrong. But the reserves account for only 1,050 teachers, a small percentage of the number that could lose their jobs if proposed state budget cuts are enacted.

So the chancellor has tried to increase parent support for ending seniority by releasing projections showing that layoffs would be disproportionately concentrated in the South Bronx, where many young teachers begin their careers, and the East Side of Manhattan, where a boom in the student population has led to a large number of new teachers. Some of their positions would be eliminated, and those that remained could be filled by more senior teachers from other schools. Mr. Borock, the Bronx teacher, said that the layoffs would discourage newer graduates from entering the profession. ""If you have a number of job opportunities, as many of us did, and you have a nagging feeling in the back of your mind that you could lose this job really quickly,"" he asked, ""why would anyone want to go into that?"" He joined a group created recently by other young teachers, Educators for Excellence, to lobby against seniority rules, taking on their own union. At River East Elementary School in Harlem, half of the teaching staff has fewer than three years of experience. Alison McKenzie, the principal, said she was worried but believed that some of the young teachers would be protected because many were certified in bilingual and special education, two areas with a shortage of teachers. Ms. McKenzie said she could not imagine losing in ""these tender situations"" a teacher whom she has supported.

Seniority is an article of faith for trade unions, which say that it protects against the whims of employers and provides stability for employees. Ms. Weingarten said that more experienced teachers were also better equipped to deal with other effects of budget cuts, like larger classes and fewer supplies. Lauren Gaudio, 29, also teaches at River East Elementary in Manhattan. Jennifer S. Altman for The New York Times Arthur Goldstein, the chapter chairman of the teachers' union at Francis Lewis High School in Queens, said that Mr. Klein and his supporters were trying to pit teachers against one another. ""I understand how they feel -- I lost my job four times and nobody ever helped me,"" Mr. Goldstein said of the younger teachers. ""I don't have a principal who is crazy now, but I've had other principals who would have fired me in a New York minute. It had nothing to do with teaching -- things he would take as a personal insult."" Ending seniority was easier in Arizona, where Republicans control the Legislature, than it will probably be in New York, where Democrats are in power and the teachers' union still has influence. In California, where unions are also fighting the bill to end seniority-based layoffs, State Senator Gloria Romero, a Democrat from East Los Angeles, said that it was crucial not to ""waste a time of crisis."" ""There has to be the willingness and the conviction to fight for the most vulnerable,"" Ms. Romero said, ""even if it means going against some of the most powerful allies that have funded the Democratic Party."" In New York, Eric T. Schneiderman, a Democratic state senator who represents Upper Manhattan and is running for attorney general, said that veteran teachers had little reason to worry.

""It wasn't just dead on arrival, it was dead before it was put in the mail,"" Mr. Schneiderman said of the legislation. ""It does open the conversation about how to ensure there are quality teachers, but the idea of giving the administration total discretion to pick and choose who is fired with no standards is not going to fly."" Limited data on teacher effectiveness in New York City suggests that a purely performance-based system would not favor younger teachers. In 2008, New York City began evaluating about 11,500 teachers based on how much their students had improved on standardized state exams. A Times analysis of the first year of results showed that teachers with 6 to 10 years of experience were more likely to perform well, while teachers with 1 or 2 years' experience were the least likely. The analysis could not account for differences in the makeup of the 11,500 classrooms, like how many of them had large numbers of students with learning disabilities. Mr. Klein has said that if he has his way, principals will be able to use a mix of factors, including student test score data and classroom observations by administrators and other teachers, as well as their own ""vision for long-term planning.""

Travel,The Golfer Lydia Ko Loves Beaches (and Legos),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/27/travel/lydia-ko-loves-beaches.html,"The golfer Lydia Ko, 20, who is currently ranked eighth globally, calls three places home: South Korea, where she was born, New Zealand's North Island, where she grew up, and Orlando, Fla., where she lives. ""They're different and all equally dear to my heart,"" she said.

Ms. Ko, who became the No. 1-ranked female professional golfer in February 2015, when she was 17, says that spending more time in each destination is at the top of her wish list, but these days, her work schedule makes that impossible. For most of the year, she travels the globe, playing at more than 25 golf tournaments, including the coming Mckayson New Zealand Women's Open, which is being held from Sept. 28 to Oct. 1 in Auckland, near where she lived for most of her life.

Below are edited excerpts from an interview with Ms. Ko.

Q: You're headed to New Zealand in September to play in the Women's Open, but how often do you get there otherwise?

A: I'm there at least once a year, sometimes twice, but my visits are mostly golf-related. I do love being there though, and even though my schedule is tight, I try to squeeze in some fun. When I'm in Auckland, that means appreciating the city's vibrancy, culture and great restaurants. I can't ever go back there and not dine at Cafe Hanoi, a Vietnamese spot where everything from the noodles to the prawns to the fish is delicious. I order the food spicy and sweat as I eat.","Her favorite destinations include Jeju Island in South Korea, Queenstown in New Zealand and Disney Springs in Orlando.",616a08e4-3189-5e58-a4d3-53a9ae4ae06b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/08/travel/08QANDA2/08ko-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=6fb838dd3b29121f30797ae65f3d5bae884886b39271746106af8ab0c2e5845c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lydia Ko during the final round of the Evian Championship women's tournament in France this month.,616a08e4-3189-5e58-a4d3-53a9ae4ae06b,N24News/imgs/616a08e4-3189-5e58-a4d3-53a9ae4ae06b.jpg,4
Movies,Watch These 12 Underseen Indie Movies on Hulu,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/movies/hulu-indie-movies.html,"Outside of big cities like New York and Los Angeles, many moviegoers don't have access to great independent films until they reach home video, and even those who can see them in theaters don't always take advantage. Hulu has become a steady destination for films from quality distributors like Neon, Magnolia and Bleecker Street; these are 12 titles the streamer is currently carrying that deserve to find an audience. After getting assaulted in his neighborhood, an ineffectual accountant (Jesse Eisenberg) starts taking karate classes at a strip-mall dojo in this dark comedy, which gets darker by the minute as the dojo's violent, alpha-male culture starts to reveal itself. The most obvious point of comparison for ""The Art of Self-Defense"" is ""Fight Club,"" another film about a rogue visionary who builds a philosophy around brutal masculinity. The Brad Pitt role here belongs to an inspired Alessandro Nivola, a sensei who teaches his students to listen to death metal music, kick with their fists and commit the occasional crime after hours. Before wowing Sundance earlier this year with the drama ""Never Rarely Sometimes Always,"" the writer and director Eliza Hittman explored the secret desires of a young man in a hypermasculine environment in this insightful and dreamily realized character piece. Harris Dickinson stars as a Brooklyn teenager who has a girlfriend (Madeline Weinstein) but trolls for older male sexual partners online, carefully keeping this information from his friends while telling himself he's neither gay nor bisexual. ""Beach Rats"" sounds adjacent to ""Moonlight,"" but it has more in common with the specific New York cultural dynamics of ""Saturday Night Fever,"" another film about thrill-seekers who run in packs, always looking for an escape from their dead-end lives.

Wearing its many influences on its sleeve, Jennifer Reeder's candy-colored slice of life movie draws from cult favorites like ""Repo Man,"" ""Suspiria,"" ""Heathers"" and the films of John Hughes. It's something of a feminist twist on ""Twin Peaks,"" spinning out from the disappearance of teenage girl. Reeder does give the audience a glimpse of what happened to her Laura Palmer type, who went missing after denying a jock a sexual favor, but she's equally compelled by what it means to her mother (Marika Engelhardt), a high-school choir teacher, and classmates who are embroiled in their own secret lives. ""Knives and Skin"" doesn't hold together perfectly, but Reeder imagines a Midwest town unlike any other and takes a particularly keen interest in how its girls interact under strange and terrifying circumstances.

The North Dakota border town of Nia DaCosta's ""Little Woods"" is like a working-class variation on the rural Ozarks in ""Winter's Bone,"" with more jobs available in construction, perhaps, but a population equally hooked on opioids. Tessa Thompson plays a reformed drug runner who's late in her probation and eyeing an opportunity for legitimate work in Spokane, Wash., but with the family home nearing foreclosure and her sister (Lily Jones) close to destitution, she unearths a bag of 500 pills she buried and starts selling again. DaCosta, who directed the upcoming remake of ""Candyman,"" grounds her hero's predicament in an austere setting where life is difficult under the best of circumstances and people are always on the precipice of disaster. Lighting a long fuse on issues of race, revolution and the legacy of global conflict, Julius Onah's provocative drama stars the gifted Kelvin Harrison Jr. as an accomplished high-school athlete, debater and scholar who isn't the uncomplicated success story he appears to be. After his history teacher (Octavia Spencer) assigns the class to write a paper from the perspective of a historical figure, he chooses Frantz Fanon, the political philosopher who believed that colonialism could only be toppled by violent revolt. His parents (Tim Roth and Naomi Watts), who adopted him from war-torn Eritrea, don't understand her alarm, but they soon discover that their son hasn't been forthcoming about how he feels and what actions he intends to take.

Not many actors get the opportunity to end their careers like Harry Dean Stanton. ""Lucky,"" a drama tailor-made for Stanton, was his last film in an onscreen career spanning more than six decades; it was released in theaters less than two weeks after he died at 91. Then again, not many actors are as brilliant as Stanton was or as willing to reveal so much of himself that close to the end. Directed by another character actor, John Carroll Lynch, the film is about a 90-year-old Texan who's been cheating death for years but must finally face the inevitable after taking a fall. What might have been a pre-fab tribute to Stanton is deepened by his willingness to show fear and vulnerability, as well as the regret of a loner who doesn't have loved ones to say goodbye. There's a for-fans-only quality to Tim Heidecker's satirical comedy: It's the latest expansion of the ""On Cinema at the Cinema"" universe, a ""Siskel & Ebert""-style movie review show parody that began life as a podcast before breaking as a web series on Thing X and Adult Swim. But even newcomers who don't get all the in-jokes can appreciate ""Mister America"" as an absurdist commentary on a period in politics when unctuous boors felt they were entitled to public service jobs. Heidecker stars as a no-hope independent candidate for district attorney of San Bernardino County, Calif., running mostly to unseat the man who charged him for second-degree murder for hawking tainted vape juice at an EDM festival.

Crystal Moselle made her directorial debut with 2015's ""The Wolfpack,"" a documentary about home-schooled brothers in Manhattan's Lower East Side who learned about the world through movies, which they'd then re-enact at home. ""Skate Kitchen"" is Moselle's graceful transition into features, but she takes a piece of documentaries with her in the film's on-the-fly naturalism and her continued interest in outcasts banding together. Real-life skateboarder Rachelle Vinberg plays a Long Island teenager who befriends a multiracial group of boarders at a New York skate park and stops coming home to her conservative mother. The improvised street scenes in ""Skate Kitchen"" may recall Larry Clark and Harmony Korine's ""Kids,"" but Moselle has a subtler feel for social dynamics and the stolen pleasures of youth. ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992) proved that sticking a bunch of great character actors in a warehouse and turning up the heat was a cheap and efficient formula for tense genre film. To that end, the drum-tight thriller ""The Standoff at Sparrow Creek"" is stocked with recognizable faces that may not come with recognizable names -- James Badge Dale, Brian Geraghty and Patrick Fischler are the leads -- but add depth to Henry Dunham's story about militia members hiding out after one of them is accused of shooting up a police funeral. The film's Waco-influenced politics are clouded with ambiguity, but the slow-burn tension is cleanly rendered, with the inevitable spasm of violence reserved for maximum impact.

The spirit of the late Jonathan Demme lives on in Andrew Bujalski's funny and generous slice of Americana, set at a downmarket Hooter's-like ""breastaurant"" called Double Whammies. Regina Hall is wonderful as its general manager, who spends her day dealing with emotionally volatile waitresses, rude customers, a faulty cable-TV connection, an attempted robbery of the office safe and the encroaching threat of a new chain about to open up. Through all this hectic action, Bujalski offers rare insight into the humbling challenges of the service industry, where hourly workers scrape together rent money with thin margins for health or child care emergencies. Well-known in improv circles and for her turns on the TV series ""Orange is the New Black"" and ""Crashing,"" the comedian Lauren Lapkus hasn't gotten the breakout roles in film that she deserves, but her daffy performance in Robert Schwartzman's cringe comedy is evidence of her talent. Lapkus and Nick Rutherford star as a long-engaged couple who head to Palm Springs, Calif., for her parents' 25th wedding anniversary. In a bid to recharge their own flatlining relationship, the couple spends one spectacularly awkward evening in search of a threesome, but their crippling inhibitions make them a poor fit for swinger culture.",The streaming service has become a reliable destination for independent films.

Technology,Police Data and the Citizen App: Partners in Crime Coverage,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/02/technology/personaltech/police-data-and-the-citizen-app-partners-in-crime-coverage.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Ali Watkins, who covers crime and law enforcement in New York, discussed the tech she's using. What are your go-to tech tools for work? I'll be the first to admit: I'm a curmudgeon when it comes to tech. I like printing out and reading documents (and recycling them!) and mapping out stories on paper. But some organizational tech tools have become critical for me to keep track of stories. I was a begrudging, late adopter of Slack, but it's been a godsend in the midst of breaking news. We can immediately create channels and pull in coverage lines for fast-moving stories like Jeffrey Epstein's death. My reporting gets organized in the Google suite: Docs, Sheets and Drive. I'm probably too millennial with voice recording -- I record interviews on my iPhone, email the voice memos directly to myself and use iTunes to review them. I carry a recorder with me in case of an emergency, but rarely use it.

As far as reporting on the police and the city, there is a whole library of tech and data tools that I use. One of the most valuable is CompStat, which is the Police Department's crime data hub. I've never seen such a user-friendly police data tool at any other department . Anyone has access to the CompStat website, which is produced by the department (and therefore needs to be taken with appropriate skepticism) but, on its face, is a wealth of data and story ideas.

If you want to compare shooting rates in a specific precinct in the Bronx over a decade, CompStat gets you those numbers in seconds. It saves us so much time on research, and has provided us with story leads and ideas. For example, if you start to see clusters of a certain crime in a precinct or neighborhood, that could be an interesting story. I also use the Citizen app, which is essentially a crowdsourcing tool for crime and emergency incidents. We don't rely on Citizen to report facts, but it becomes important for us during breaking news, when initial wire reports are often wrong or confusing. Citizen allows anyone with a user profile to post what he or she is seeing, and even live-stream from a crime scene. Say a report comes across the wire that a shooting happened in Brooklyn. Details are sparse: multiple shots fired, one victim in unknown condition. Someone could be dead -- or someone's arm might have just been grazed. I'll check Citizen and see if anyone is streaming from the scene to decide if I should flag for the desk and head to the scene, or just monitor the situation remotely.

I do keep an old-school police scanner at home (passed down from my editor, Jim McKinley). Sometimes I'll turn it on and listen to traffic, usually for nearby precincts. But it's pretty clunky and not very efficient. How does New York City's criminal justice system use technology? And how is it changing? The city's embrace of tech is manic. There are elements of New York's criminal justice system that are up to date and streamlined, like electronic court records and crime data. CompStat, for example, was a watershed development in data policing. But police use of technology is fraught. We're not talking about a private entity embracing a new interoffice communication system. We're talking about a very powerful institution -- the New York City Police Department -- using extremely powerful technology in ways that affect people's lives (and have a disproportionate impact on brown and black lives). In some of the cases we know about, like the N.Y.P.D.'s use of facial recognition software, the technology is too new to inspire full confidence, and it is so new that the tech industry isn't even sure what a coherent law enforcement policy should look like. It's fertile reporting ground, but it should give pause to both departments and the people who are covering them.

As soon as I get a name associated with a crime, I scrub social media. If a victim, did he or she post anything before the crime that would give us a lead? Did friends post any cryptic Instagram story, or tweet something strange? What about perpetrators? Sometimes it's still surprising to me how much of a narrative we can piece together just by going through people's social media accounts. In many cases, we're looking at the same open-source material the police are looking at. What are some of your tech best practices for protecting the confidentiality of sources? Burner phones are the only way I ever feel remotely confident, and even those aren't fail-safe. You could do everything right with a burner -- buy it in cash, register it under a different name, keep any identifying information off it -- and the second it plugs into the Wi-Fi in the office, it's toast. My best advice is to go as old school as you can. Meet sensitive sources in person. Before you go, look at everything you're carrying, everything you're wearing, and don't take anything that has electronic components. (Smart watch? Take it off.) Don't Uber. If you have to drive, take a cab and pay in cash. (License plate readers? E-ZPass? Don't chance it.) Never pay with a credit card. Reverse engineer every sensitive meeting: If I were an institution and wanted to find out about this, what electronic trail would I be able to follow? Nothing is too paranoid.

How do you unplug from tech? I love unplugging. Everyone should do it, as often and responsibly as possible. I make semiregular efforts to go places where there is zero cell service, just so I'm not tempted to check Twitter. I'll use GPS to get wherever I'm going, and I use an offline GPS tracker when I'm out somewhere remote alone (a request from my mother), but that's it. I've actually found that unplugging helps clarify my reporting instincts. It's such a critical reminder that as journalists, so much of our worldview is shaped by the weird media bubble the algorithms create for us. Getting outside of that can be productive.","On her New York City law enforcement beat, Ali Watkins mines CompStat for trends and crowdsourcing for breaking news.

Books,Two Dudes With a Camera,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/18/books/review/mark-jay-duplass-like-brothers.html,"It's a strange symptom of our increasingly thin-sliced culture that you may spend your whole life without encountering the work of the Duplass brothers, or you may feel as if you see it everywhere. As a duo, the sibling filmmakers, Jay and Mark, have written and directed a couple of innovative and endearing low-budget independent features (""The Puffy Chair,"" ""Baghead"") and a few modestly sized studio movies (""Cyrus,"" ""Jeff, Who Lives at Home""). They're creators of the dearly departed TV comedy-drama ""Togetherness"" and the oddball anthology series ""Room 104,"" both for HBO. Individually, Mark, who is 41, with short hair and a dude's dude looks, starred in the FX comedy ""The League,"" and Jay, who is 45, and often bearded and bespectacled, plays one of the neurotic siblings on the Amazon series ""Transparent."" The Duplasses are cool enough to know that it's not cool to admit to having a brand, but they most assuredly do: They represent a style of storytelling that's naturalistic and unapologetically earnest, along with a supportive, if-we-can-do-it-you-can-too spirit of creativity.

Sure, there are also parts that seem extraneous or simply don't work, but the Duplasses never pretend to be masters of their craft. As they write in the book: ""It seems that people like the Coen brothers have a specific vision of what their movies will look like from the moment they begin writing them, and then somehow are able to realize that vision and make those movies, for the most part, inspired and impeccably amazing. We, however, are not the Coen brothers."" In episodic chapters, the Duplasses recount their upbringing in Metairie, La., and boyhood rites of passage like getting cable TV and a video camera to shoot their first movies. There's a refreshing unpretentiousness to these sections: The brothers are unabashed fans of kitsch like ""The Karate Kid Part II"" and the soft-rock duo Air Supply, and their close-knit kinship turns poignant when Jay has an emotional breakdown as a student at the University of Texas at Austin and Mark, still in high school, travels there to take care of him.

Though their early, self-financed foray into grown-up moviemaking is a mediocre ""Rocky"" knockoff called ""Vince Del Rio,"" the brothers eventually earn acclaim at the Sundance Film Festival: first, in 2003, with a $3 short film called ""This Is John,"" and then, in 2005, with ""The Puffy Chair,"" a relationship road-trip feature. Initially, the Duplasses seem to be living the fantasy of every indie filmmaker: ""Buyers, agents, managers, producers and studio executives were all swarming us,"" they write. But they quickly realize that these industry big shots are interested in developing other ideas with them, not in acquiring the movie the Duplasses made using $10,000 borrowed from their parents. ""In short,"" they write, ""we seemed to be in demand, but we couldn't figure out how to actually make money.""

It takes many months for the brothers to receive a legitimate offer for ""The Puffy Chair,"" and while they are eager to accept it, for the amount of money alone, they somehow find the fortitude to resist, and end up agreeing to a different deal -- one that provides no money up front but includes distribution from an upstart DVD-by-mail company called Netflix. It's a valuable lesson in patience that has continued to pay dividends for the Duplasses, who signed a four-picture deal with Netflix earlier this year. While I appreciated the brothers' honest tales of dealing with anxiety, filial conflict and failing equipment during their collaborations, I was less taken with a chapter in which they reproduce an early draft of one of their unfilmed story ideas, along with Jay's handwritten notes, though readers' interest in this sort of paraphernalia may vary. Other sections, in which they compile and consolidate lists of their Top 10 films of all time, or imagine elaborate back stories for strangers they see at airports, may seem charming to devoted fans but felt like filler to me. More worrisome were passages in which the brothers, for all of their enthusiasm and desire to get others to participate in cinema, seem unaware of their inherent privilege as white men from a comfortable background, and who, as siblings working together, have an irresistible gimmick. It's probably not especially helpful for struggling, financially strapped young filmmakers at the start of their careers to be told to buy a house as soon as possible and pay off the mortgage by renting out bedrooms to creative pals. And the brothers' advice to invest in the stock market -- the Duplasses say they bought ""a slew of shares"" of Netflix in 2005 -- isn't practical unless you possess a trust fund or a time machine. Still, it's hard not to root for the Duplasses in moments like the one when their sales agent tells them they're not allowed to attend the Sundance after-party for their film ""Baghead,"" lest it appear that they're not engaged in heated efforts to get the movie sold. In another passage, they find themselves fighting with studio executives who want them to reshoot a scene from ""Cyrus,"" because they feel the apartment of its lead character -- a depressed divorce -- needs more throw pillows. After getting uncharacteristically loud and standing their ground, the brothers win the day. ""From that moment forward,"" the Duplasses write, ""they pretty much let us do our thing. Which was a wonderful and terrible thing in the end.""","In their first book, ""Like Brothers,"" the indie filmmaker siblings Jay and Mark Duplass recount their unlikely path to Hollywood and tell readers how to follow suit.",2c0e8f66-4057-5cbd-bf9c-20eb89a0d6f1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/books/review/20Itzkoff1/20Itzkoff1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f572271daf8e607be723d667a9ff0231edec75cacc7c11fe4fbd7f4a7eb4a96a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jay Duplass,2c0e8f66-4057-5cbd-bf9c-20eb89a0d6f1,N24News/imgs/2c0e8f66-4057-5cbd-bf9c-20eb89a0d6f1.jpg,13
Television,"'The Alienist' Season 1, Episode 7: A Devil's Bargain",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/arts/television/the-alienist-recap-many-sainted-men.html,"Like the killer himself, the action and suspense that fueled last week's intense and engaging episode of ""The Alienist"" slinked back into the shadows this time around. But what this week's episode lacks in adrenaline it makes up for in oratory. Written by the screenwriter, director and novelist John Sayles, the episode features meaty near-monologues from a variety of characters, all of whom offer insight into the evil that people do. The first to climb the soapbox is Chief Byrnes, who is livid after learning that his dogsbody Captain Connor -- excuse me, ex-Captain Connor -- murdered Willem Van Bergen, the filthy-rich predator he had been assigned to protect. ""Let me tell you how this city is run, you stupid mick,"" Byrnes growls (in an Irish accent). ""We serve the rich, and in return they raise us above the primordial filth. And God help us if we don't keep up our end of the bargain."" As he delivers the rest of the speech, the Chief's face looks as if it were hewed from stone, while his eyes burn with anger and fear. It's a marvelous moment for the actor Ted Levine, and a clarifying jolt for Connor. Next up is Byrnes's occasional ally of convenience, the Italian-American gangster Paul Kelly (nee Paolo Vaccarelli). Having rescued Dr. Laszlo Kreizler and John Moore from a near riot over the killing they failed to prevent -- a riot he himself engineered -- Kelly warns Kreizler and Moore that they have more to worry about than the murderer, or his own organization for that matter.

""You are fighting a monster,"" he says, ""one that reaches from Millionaire's Mile all the way down to Mulberry Street. And if you're not careful, it will devour you long before you find your child killer."" Kelly paints the entire city as haunted by malevolent force, like a small Maine town in a Stephen King novel. A different kind of inescapable evil gets an airing when Kreizler visits Cyrus in the hospital, who is recovering from a head wound inflicted by the killer. The doctor finds Cyrus's niece, Joanna Crawford (Brittany Marie Batchelder), tending to him. A reporter for The Philadelphia Tribune, she attended college courtesy of Kreizler, who paid for her schooling as a gift to Cyrus and his family. To Crawford, however, both this gift and his continued ""friendship"" with her uncle, who entered Laszlo's service after committing a justifiable homicide, are signs of condescension and control, not generosity. Kreizler, she believes, is simply keeping Cyrus downtrodden with his courtesies and progressive ideas -- ""more effective than using shackles and a whip."" Echoing criticisms leveled today at ""performative wokeness,"" Joanna's assertions about Laszlo's character hit him as hard as any he's heard so far. He spends the rest of the episode attempting to make it up to not only Cyrus but also to his other servants, Stevie and Mary. In Mary's case, his suggestion that perhaps it's time she strike out on her own is greeted with explosive indignation. So he invites her to dinner instead. When he finally reaches out to take her hand, initiating what becomes a passionate kiss, a clever bit of camerawork begins with Mary offscreen and follows Laszlo's his hand as it traverses the space between them until she is finally in the frame -- a visual representation of the effort required to bridge the emotional gap. Yet another speech on the evils that plague the city isn't delivered by a knowing scoundrel like Byrnes or Kelly, nor by a sharp sociopolitical analyst like Joanna. It's delivered by a man so rich and powerful that he can bend society and politics to his will and no one thinks of him as a scoundrel at all. Using Connor as muscle and employing Byrnes (and Bishop Potter) as backup, J.P. Morgan has Moore and Kreizler abducted and brought to his mansion. At first, Morgan indulges his cohorts' demands that the investigation be dropped because of the high social standing of their suspect.

But Kreizler's insistence that Willem Van Bergen isn't the killer enables Morgan to put aside upper-class solidarity and address his real concerns. New York, he says, is on the verge of becoming history's greatest economic powerhouse. But for that to happen, he says, ""We need a compliant work force."" He continues: ""The civil unrest caused by these murders troubles me a great deal. A great deal indeed. Perhaps even more than the murders themselves. A harsh truth, but a truth nonetheless."" In other words, dead children are usually just unfortunate; when their corpses clog the flow of capital, it's a crisis. Wisely, Kreizler refuses Morgan's offer of financial support for the investigation, knowing Morgan would want something in return. (""What could a man like J.P. Morgan want from you?"" John asks incredulously. ""I don't know,"" Laszlo replies, ""but I'm most unwilling to find out."") And the investigation continues despite these obstacles. Changes in the killer's methods of mutilation remind Commissioner Roosevelt, who is present when the team examines the corpse, of massacres he witnessed during his time in the Dakotas. (The future president befriended Seth Bullock, the real-life basis for the ""Deadwood"" lawman, during his time out West. I smell a crossover!) With a surprisingly low level of colonialist racism for their time, the team figures out that the killer is not actually a Native American, whose mutilations of enemy corpses are informed by a very specific spiritual logic. The killer is likely a white man who witnessed such mutilations, probably as a child, and who applies his own twisted meanings to them as he recreates them. After a harrowing visit to a mental institution, Sara Howard identifies a new suspect: a soldier, previously interned in the United States government's secret hospital for soldiers suffering from what today we would call post-traumatic stress, and other mental disorders. Thus the breadth of any potential conspiracy widens even further. On a final note, the progress of Sara and John's romance has become nearly as compelling to track as the murder investigation because of the character insights it uncovers along the way. In fact, the couple's most intimate scene in this week's episode isn't actually romantic at all, although it does end with Miss Howard leaning against Mr. Moore in a heartfelt embrace.

When Sara presents her breakthrough in the child-killer case to John, the vehemence of her refusal to reveal her findings to Kreizler directly is unmistakable. John knows something must have happened between them, and asks what it was with an edge of alarm in his voice. ""He was right about one thing,"" Sara explains. ""Given certain circumstances, we're all capable of violence."" The actor Dakota Fanning excels at radiating shock, pain, and betrayal from behind Sara's practiced composure, and the script follows suit: She never says outright that Laszlo struck her, but she powerfully conveys the moral gravity of Kreizler's blow nonetheless. ""The Alienist"" has often been so focused on its central murders that its other acts of violence feel like afterthoughts -- most notably the sexual assault against John arranged by Captain Connor and Paul Kelly, which at least gets alluded to by Kelly during their carriage ride, but which doesn't seem to have affected John at all. It's good to see the show treat this assault -- a man's hitting a woman, essentially for mouthing off to him -- with due seriousness.","Written by the screenwriter, director and novelist John Sayles, this week's episode swapped action for oratory punch.",03aa87ec-0d6b-5143-b207-9c5a0ee2e6c5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/02/arts/05alienist-recap/05watching-slide-CXQH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=988a3c26dca2dfe1c4b552ec05cb6a436ec6f447f970b9dab8c9bc12ca5964a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Luke Evans in ""The Alienist.""",03aa87ec-0d6b-5143-b207-9c5a0ee2e6c5,N24News/imgs/03aa87ec-0d6b-5143-b207-9c5a0ee2e6c5.jpg,3
Music,Review: Conjuring the Splintered Self With Electronics and Voice,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/29/arts/music/kate-soper-new-york-festival-of-song-review.html,"For much of music history, songs were accompanied by an instrument that could act as a foil to the human voice. In recent decades electronics have often taken the place of the lute or piano, with dramatic effects. When the taped sounds contains snippets of the voice itself -- recorded either beforehand or sampled live in performance -- the distinction between song and accompaniment dissolves.

But there's also a risk that this dialogue with technology becomes little more than an echo chamber, too insular and self-validating. On Thursday at the DiMenna Center, the New York Festival of Song presented an evening of works for voice and electronics that sometimes felt sterile and self-absorbed.

The program was designed by the composer and vocalist Kate Soper and opened with her performing her own ""The Understanding of All Things."" The text is by Kafka and imagines a philosopher who snatches spinning tops from playing children in an attempt to understand reality. Ms. Soper's setting takes a dryly literal approach, with recorded sounds of a spinning top mixing with scrambled phrases and her own live, fragmented, recitation. The attentive sound artist here and throughout the evening was Sam Pluta.

Electronics can blur the border between human and machine-made sounds in a way that allows artists to play on themes like alienation, objectification and the splintering of the self. The composer Natacha Diels's ""Bahnhof"" was a twist on the ancient myth of Philomela, the abused woman who, deprived of speech, turns into a nightingale.","A program of works designed by the vocalist and composer Kate Soper had moments of expressive richness, but sometimes felt like an echo chamber.",c5dfcdcc-cc85-5e58-a615-f06cd501f183,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/30/arts/29nyfos-1/29nyfos-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=6550c211c341af2ccbcd5f0eb9909a44fc442438dc8e4994bbbb71c38a66dc42&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Charlotte Mundy in her special gloves that have sensors at the fingertips and are tethered with cables to a laptop.,c5dfcdcc-cc85-5e58-a615-f06cd501f183,N24News/imgs/c5dfcdcc-cc85-5e58-a615-f06cd501f183.jpg,12
Television,PBS's Sexy 'Sanditon' Finishes What Jane Austen Started,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/08/arts/television/sanditon-jane-austen-pbs.html,"Rose Williams stars as a young woman in an emerging seaside resort town in ""Sanditon,"" based on the unfinished Jane Austen novel.





BRISTOL, England -- Three hundred candles reflecting off gold walls cast a rich, hazy glow upon the dancers, who squealed with excitement as they changed partners in a boisterous round. To the side, a beautiful young woman locked eyes with a tall, handsome man. But before he could approach her, another suitor stepped in and asked, ""May I have the pleasure?"" As she extended her hand, he walked into a tall light, ruining the take and sending the cast into hysterics. ""I don't think Jane Austen wrote it like that,"" a cameraman said. In fact, although the balls, courtship, love and obstacles will feel familiar to Janeites the world over, there isn't much of ""Sanditon,"" a new eight-part Austen adaptation arriving Sunday on PBS's ""Masterpiece,"" that was taken directly from the author's writings. ""Sanditon,"" which was filmed here last June and premiered in Britain in August, is based on Austen's final, unfinished work, a book relatively unknown even to fans of her six much-filmed completed novels. Austen had written only 11 chapters of ""Sanditon"" and had begun a 12th when, suffering from an unspecified illness, she stopped writing on March 18, 1817. Four months later, she died at age 41, and it was only in 1925 that the story was published in its partial form.

Once arrived, she meets Tom's brothers, the dashing Sidney (Theo James) and the hypochondriacal Arthur (Turlough Convery), as well as a variety of Sanditon's inhabitants, including the rich and doughty Lady Denham (Anne Reid) and an assortment of her impecunious relatives. She also hears of Miss Lambe (Crystal Clarke), a young heiress from the West Indies whose wealth and racial background has sent ripples through the white provincial town. And that's about as far as the story goes. Several novelists have attempted continuations (there is even a detective version by Reginald Hill). But this is the first attempt at a cinematic extension of the tale, masterminded by the veteran screenwriter Andrew Davies (""Les Miserables,"" ""War and Peace""), who has previously adapted four of Austen's other six novels for television. ""It wasn't my idea, but I can't think why I hadn't thought of it, because I had read it and thought how interesting it was,"" Davies said in a telephone interview. ""This was the first time Austen set a whole novel at the seaside, and her characters, who are normally very conservative, living very settled lives, are a bunch of guys trying to set up a bells-and-whistles seaside resort.""

Tom and Sidney Parker, Davies pointed out, ""are a new type of man, from gentry stock but willing to gamble everything on a risky business venture."" And with Miss Lambe, Jane Austen's only black major character, ""You think, what is she going to do with that?"" What Davies (together with his co-writers, Justin Young and Andrea Gibb) do with it is to give Georgiana Lambe a story line of her own, with a forbidden lover in London, Otis Molyneux (Jyuddah Jaymes), a young black man involved in political activism. ""When I first got the script, my initial expectation was that this would be another black character who is a servant or something,"" Clarke said in a telephone interview. ""What I got was the exact opposite, a real effort to represent someone in a very difficult situation at the time. Jane Austen was clearly very aware of the slave trade, and the issue isn't avoided in Andrew's script."" ""Racism, prejudice, Georgiana's sense of alienation in Britain -- it's all there,"" she added.

Susanne Simpson, the executive producer of ""Masterpiece,"" said that one of the attractions of ""Sanditon,"" was that it was ""a little different"" from the Austen adaptations the series did previously. ""It's the story of self-made men, men who made money from trade, from the West Indies, perhaps indirectly through slavery,"" she said. ""I think Austen was really reflecting on her time."" And in addition to entrepreneurship, slavery and racism, there is a lot more nudity and sex than Jane Austen purists might consider seemly. ""I wanted to have a bit of fun with it, and not be quite as decorous as when adapting a full novel,"" Davies said.

In ""Sanditon,"" he adds a note of incestuous lust to the relationship between stepsiblings Esther (Charlotte Spencer) and Edward Denham (Jack Fox), and more than a suggestion of the calculating, sexually experienced survivor of abuse underlying the meek exterior of the penniless Clara Brereton (Lily Sacofsky), companion to Lady Denham. Davies also upgrades Colin Firth's signature wet-shirted emergence from the lake as Mr. Darcy in his 1995 adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice."" In ""Sanditon,"" Sidney Parker is surprised by Charlotte as he materializes, entirely naked, from the sea. When he later apologizes for causing her any mortification, she responds tartly. ""Why should I be embarrassed?"" she says. ""I had all my clothes on."" James (best known for his role as Tobias Eaton in the ""Divergent"" film trilogy) said that he had grown up watching the Davies's adaptation of ""Pride and Prejudice"" and had been drawn to the idea of playing the ""Austen antihero-hero."" ""I liked this dislikable character that you soften towards, and with television, you can let that happen slowly,"" he said. ""I also wanted Sidney to be more dangerous and volatile than other Austen heroes. He is a physical person, with a potential for violence, who drinks and smokes and rabble-rouses, not a period drama type."" Williams, who plays Charlotte Heywood as an opinionated, independent spirit, said that she felt there was something of Catherine Morland from ""Northanger Abbey"" in her character, as well as a touch of Elizabeth Bennet from ""Pride and Prejudice."" But her central sense of the role came from Davies's scripts, she said.

At least for men. It was interesting, Williams added, to play a free-spirited woman in an age when women couldn't sign contracts and any of their own money immediately became their husband's property upon marriage. ""On the surface, it looks all very arty, hair piled up, pretty, flow-y dresses, but underneath you are wearing a corset,"" Williams said. ""That underlying physical constraint echoes social constraints that I think Austen was very aware of."" The fact that a married woman's money becomes her husband's property drives two separate narrative strands of ""Sanditon"" and, controversially, determines an ending that leaves plenty of leeway for a second season. Let's just say that while the turn of the plot is Austen-like (duty set against desire, obligations versus impulse), it's the kind of narrative twist that might more commonly come midway through an Austen novel rather than at its end. ""Sanditon"" viewers left OUTRAGED,"" a Daily Mail headline screeched after the final episode aired on Britain's ITV. (Don't read the article if you want to avoid spoilers.) ""It's not a secret that we were hoping to get more than one series,"" said Davies. ""We are very keen on our main characters and wanted to give them more mileage. But yes, there was rage and frustration on Twitter."" Olly Blackburn, who directed the first three episodes and extensively researched the Regency period, worked closely with the actors on period manners and mores, and defended Davies's decision to deviate from Austen conventions.","The ""Masterpiece"" series, based on Austen's uncompleted final novel, features many of the author's hallmarks, plus skinny-dipping.",f0b9129c-356a-54aa-839b-dd9125625af4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/09/arts/08sanditon1/08sanditon1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f9336d753a1dbc55775e0249f0e15c9030c17291ad9cf637891f03bfc850c716&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rose Williams stars as a young woman in an emerging seaside resort town in &ldquo;Sanditon,&rdquo; based on the unfinished Jane Austen novel.",f0b9129c-356a-54aa-839b-dd9125625af4,N24News/imgs/f0b9129c-356a-54aa-839b-dd9125625af4.jpg,3

Media,Selling Products With a Swelling Score,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/business/media/classical-music-advertising.html,"When the figures on a graffiti mural came to vibrant life in a Coke commercial that debuted during the Olympics last month, they leapt, rolled and scaled buildings to the accompaniment of ""In the Hall of the Mountain King,"" a movement of Edvard Grieg's ""Peer Gynt"" Suite. A Chevron commercial about the efficacy of drones gets a shot of adrenaline from that bane of piano students, Rimsky-Korsakov's ""Flight of the Bumblebee."" Tchaikovsky's ""1812"" Overture, once used to sell Quaker puffed cereal, is now featured in an ad for Myrbetriq, a drug for treating an overactive bladder. Meanwhile, a Geico ad makes its point with an assist from Bach's ""Brandenburg"" Concerto No. 3 -- and a clueless percussionist shredding a triangle solo. Classical music has long had a place in commercials. The Western canon's aura makes it just the thing for pitching luxury brands like the Lincoln Motor Company, whose 2017 holiday ad unfolded over a track of Shostakovich's swoony Waltz No. 2.

Consider the Applebee's ad that features a robed choir paying full-throated reverence to riblets and tenders (""All you can eat ... $12.99, all you can eat"") to the tune of Carl Orff's ""O Fortuna,"" from the cantata ""Carmina Burana."" Or the 2015 Oreo Thins ad that was backed up by Richard Strauss's ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" otherwise known as the theme from ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" But these days, ad agencies are using classical music as more than a jokey device or a signifier of wealth and sophistication. A snippet of Arvo Part's ""Spiegel im Spiegel"" threads through an ad for the rugged but hardly luxe Jeep Cherokee. And Coke, while a classic, is the most democratic of beverages. It may have something to do with pop fatigue. ""The name of the game is to stand out,"" said Jon Pearce, the chief creative officer at Hudson Rouge, a boutique ad agency in the WPP network. ""If you're going up against a lot of commercials with contemporary music and energy, the way to get attention is to land on people's ears in a different way.""

Some products split the difference. A Delta faucet ad that began airing in 2016 uses ""Habanera"" from Bizet's ""Carmen"" to underscore the elegance of the fixtures in question, and an electronic dance beat shows how hard those fixtures work. A 2017 Mountain Dew ad, set in an underground garage, led off with a hip-hop rhythm, then segued into Chopin's Fantaisie-Impromptu in C-sharp minor.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. And there is this: Classical music can be cost effective. ""There are so many production catalogs that have lush orchestral versions of all these songs that don't require purchasing rights because they're in the public domain,"" said Chris Clark, the director of music at Leo Burnett U.S.A. ""It's wonderful to be able to open the classical music treasure chest."" Agencies also benefit from what the composer and arranger Robert Miller calls the recognition factor. ""The thing about 'Hall of the Mountain King' is that there was something profoundly familiar and legitimate about it that was going to allow the animation to come to life in a way that brand new music may not have allowed,"" said Mr. Miller, who scored the current Coke commercial as well as several other Coke ads that used classical music. As Karl Westman, the director of music at Ogilvy, put it: ""This music immediately pulls the switch for us. Even if we're not mavens we understand it because it's so deeply seated in our daily lives."" A half-dozen years ago, Mr. Westman deployed the ""William Tell"" Overture in a commercial for the deodorant Dove Men +Care and, more recently, the ""Anvil Chorus"" from Verdi's opera ""Il Trovatore"" in an ad for a technology client. Another plus: Bach and friends aren't around to object. ""It's fantastic working with a dead composer,"" said Hal Curtis, the creative director of the ad agency Wieden & Kennedy. ""They like all your comments, they listen to all your ideas, and they do exactly what you want.""

The risk for advertisers is turning off the audience. ""People could be intimidated by classical music or feel they're out of their depth,"" Mr. Muhlenfeld of the Martin Agency said. There's also a hazard of being just a bit too obvious: reflexively trotting out Delibes or Debussy to provide the soundtrack for a scene that shouts ""tuxedo territory."" ""Classical music will always do the job,"" Mr. Clark of Leo Burnett said. ""But as a creative professional, you don't want to just say, 'Let's use ""Peer Gynt,""' and then press play on it. You want to alter the instrumentation or juxtapose it with something contemporary. You want to show people how indelible these compositions are and how enjoyable in different contexts.""","Classical music has long had a place in commercials, but now it is being used as more than a jokey device or a signal of sophistication.",b2c2c961-49b3-5336-a99a-9ebabf895299,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/26/business/26ADCO1/26ADCO1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=81629d62436a2a8ad00418d2b0a3b588c0579523577798652773961253587f64&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bach's ""Brandenburg"" Concerto No. 3 gets a headbanging triangle solo in a commercial for Geico.",b2c2c961-49b3-5336-a99a-9ebabf895299,N24News/imgs/b2c2c961-49b3-5336-a99a-9ebabf895299.jpg,16
Dance,Top of the Line,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/11/arts/dance/standouts-of-american-ballet-theaters-corps-de-ballet.html,"At American Ballet Theater, where international stars zip on and off the stage like point shoes on a conveyor belt, there is gratification in knowing your corps de ballet. Along with the soloists, these dancers constitute the heart of the company, which opens its spring season Monday at the Metropolitan Opera House. It may sound simplistic, but what sets these six apart in a corps of 61 -- besides their promise and rigor -- is the sheer breadth of their dancing. They think about transition steps. They don't pause before a turn. They move without waiting for applause. Here's to the new blood. After training in jazz and tap, Eric Tamm fell in love with ballet while watching Ballet Theater performances at the Met and, as he put it, ""not being able to sleep at night."" An incisive, musical dancer, Mr. Tamm has just started studying the piano, all the more appropriate given his coming performances in Balanchine's poetic ""Duo Concertant"" this season with Misty Copeland. Mr. Tamm said he believes in being well-rounded; he's just produced a dance film, ""On a Grass Field."" At Ballet Theater, where the line for leading parts is long and often monopolized by international stars, he finds that having options helps. ""The hardest part about getting older is realizing that there is the business side to companies,"" he said. ""As a dancer, you have to go back to being 5 years old and dancing in your living room. I still have that.""

Dream roles usually define a dancer, but Skylar Brandt wants none of that: As much as she hopes to dance Juliet one day, she also has her eye on the sassy, flamboyant Kitri in ""Don Quixote."" Ms. Brandt, who surprised herself by progressing far in the casting calls for the forthcoming Starz show ""Flesh and Bone,"" is a sparkling actress as well as a dancer; her performances in Alexei Ratmansky's ""Piano Concerto #1"" are imbued with as much mystery as daring, boundless joy. This season, she hopes to perform the Spring Fairy in ""Cinderella,"" as well as the lead Can-Can Girl in ""Gaite Parisienne."" For Ms. Brandt, who began studying at the Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School at Ballet Theater when she was 12, the troupe is the only home she's ever known. ""I've never thought about another company, which could be taken as really foolish and narrow-minded,"" she said. ""But I like to think of it more as determination."" At 6 foot 1, Calvin Royal III may be a majestic presence at Ballet Theater, but he didn't start out on a dance track. In eighth grade, he dropped his ambition to become a classical pianist to try, as Mr. Royal explained, ""something completely out of my comfort zone."" The girls in his ballet class nicknamed him Grasshopper, because he was so lanky and out of control. ""I would come home every day just in pain, sore, popping Advil,"" he said. But after two years of training, he was awarded a scholarship at the Onassis School. Since joining Ballet Theater, he has owned leading parts in Mr. Ratmansky's ""Piano Concerto #1"" and Twyla Tharp's ""Bach Partita,"" which, he admitted, was a challenge. ""Twyla was like, 'You need to take some time for yourself and figure out how to make this work for your body and your dancing, because ultimately it's you out there,' "" Mr. Royal said. ""Just raw. I feel like I've been told that before, but, for some reason, the way she said it was like, O.K., I can do this. I felt like I had her there with me."" And onstage? ""It was like a caged bird being set free.""

The luminous Australian dancer Stephanie Williams relishes movement, as she deftly proved in Mark Morris's ""Drink to Me Only With Thine Eyes."" As she said: ""I'm not a static person at all. I feel like I really use dance as a form of escapism. I can't just do steps. Even in class, they're like, 'Calm down, Stephanie, calm down.' "" Ms. Williams came to Ballet Theater with experience, having danced previously with the Australian Ballet, Christopher Wheeldon's Morphoses and Het Nationale Ballet in Amsterdam. Her stint with Morphoses, where she said she encountered ""real people, real artists,"" changed her path. ""It really opened my eyes as to how every individual is worthy, myself included,"" she said. ""I wanted to experience more of that. It's made me live more in the moment."" She sent a letter of intent to Ballet Theater and eventually got the job. This season, Ms. Williams hopes to perform the Summer Fairy in ""Cinderella"" and Zulme in ""Giselle,"" but her desire, down the line, is to conquer the dramatic parts: Giselle, Tatiana in ""Onegin"" and Juliet. ""That's a real woman suffering,"" she said. ""We all have gone through pain and heartache. And I love dancing with a man. It's just the best.""

It's no surprise that Joseph Gorak grew up training with Fernando Bujones, the Ballet Theater star revered for his purity of form. With his finely pointed feet and scrupulous classical line, Mr. Gorak is a future prince who opts for elegance over flash. While there are others like him in today's virtuosic landscape, it takes some resolve to stay that way. ""We have so many male dancers who can do so many extraordinary things; they might not be ballet, but they can do them,"" he said, laughing. ""I never want to get to a point where I compromise correct style or technique for an extra pirouette or going overboard with a jump."" This season, Mr. Gorak makes his debut as the mischievous Franz opposite Yuriko Kajiya in ""Coppelia."" Lately, he's been focusing on his partnering with Keith Roberts, a newly appointed ballet master. ""I get so tense,"" Mr. Gorak said. ""When I'm partnering a girl, I can claw."" He gripped his hands around an imaginary waist. ""But Keith has taught me how to breathe and to work with my hands more."" Last season's transformative turn as Lensky in ""Onegin"" pushed him in the right direction, too. ""I was always so scared onstage,"" he said. ""I still have stage fright, but I've learned that this is an art form, and if I'm going to go out there being scared, then what's the point of doing it? I'm definitely going with the flow more these days.""

When it came to knowing the difference between male and female variations in ballet, Devon Teuscher was clueless. Her Russian teacher, Alexander Nagiba, recognized how strong she was and just taught her everything. It wasn't until she arrived at Ballet Theater that she realized she had been dancing male parts, too. ""I was like: Wait a second. I did that,"" she said, laughing. ""It taught me to be able to do whatever I'm thrown and not think twice."" Despite her prodigious strength, Ms. Teuscher is all upper-body eloquence. This season, she reprises Myrta, the imperious Queen of the Wilis in ""Giselle."" It's taxing. ""You're doing essentially a full class in not even 10 minutes,"" she said. ""But it's a rush."" In the past couple of seasons, Ms. Teuscher has flourished; by her own admission, it took her a long time to build confidence. ""I was so afraid to get in anyone's way or do anything wrong that it took me the longest time -- until last year -- to even stand in front in class,"" she said. ""It was very difficult for me to break out of my shell and recognize that I'm getting these opportunities for a reason, and so I need to embrace that.""","Glimpses of life in the corps de ballet at American Ballet Theater, which opens its spring season Monday at the Metropolitan Opera House.",95bade30-47e3-56eb-a888-0abfde007630,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/05/11/arts/11ABT1_SPAN/11ABT1_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=c640e6987090cb6e28a85b795a04f6c020b8d3a081bc14a20fb22af923ed77ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Top from left, Eric Tamm, Skylar Brandt, Calvin Royal III, Stephanie Williams, Joseph Gorak and Devon Teuscher.",95bade30-47e3-56eb-a888-0abfde007630,N24News/imgs/95bade30-47e3-56eb-a888-0abfde007630.jpg,6
Science,Seeking Clues to Longevity in Lonesome George's Genes,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/08/science/lonesome-george-tortoise.html,"When Lonesome George, the only survivor of the Pinta Island tortoises of the Galapagos, died in 2012, the news landed with a blow. Rationally, people had time to prepare for the reality that George would one day fade away, and with him, an entire lineage. He had lived for a century or more, a common life expectancy for giant tortoises, and all attempts to mate him during his last few decades were unsuccessful. But emotionally, it's hard to brace oneself for the realization that something that was once there is finally, completely gone. It's the kind of stuff that makes you ponder life, our fleeting stint in the universe and the unrelenting, forward march of time. Similar feelings drive longevity research. Recently, a team of scientists turned to George for help in this search, mining his genetic code for clues to his long life span.

In a paper published Monday in Nature Ecology & Evolution, the researchers reported preliminary findings of gene variants in George linked with a robust immune system, efficient DNA repair and resistance to cancer. The study also sets the stage for understanding giant tortoises' evolutionary past, which might help to conserve them in the future. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Giant tortoises helped launch the theory of evolution. When Charles Darwin visited the Galapagos, he noticed the tortoises' shell shapes were unique adaptations to their environments. He hypothesized that natural selection was at work. The Galapagos tortoises have since continued to be a rich source of inquiry for evolutionary scientists. Adalgisa ""Gisella"" Caccone, a researcher at Yale University, has spent decades studying the reptiles that are the size of upright pianos. But years ago, Dr. Caccone hit a wall -- she needed someone to help her decipher which parts of the tortoises' DNA were functional genes, which regions were not and what the genes' functions might be. She received a fateful message from Carlos Lopez-Otin, a professor at the University of Oviedo in Spain who has built a career studying cancer and aging in humans. Dr. Lopez-Otin was interested in unlocking the genetic secrets behind giant tortoises' legendary longevity.

Dr. Caccone loved the idea of ""a conservation icon providing insights"" into human health and longevity. The scientists sequenced the entire genome of Lonesome George, plus that of an Aldabra giant tortoise from the Seychelles, another extraordinarily long-lived species (one was rumored to have lived up to 250 years in captivity). The researchers then compared the tortoise genomes with those of mammals, fish, birds and other reptiles, looking for discrepancies that could affect aging. The scientists found evidence that a mutation in a gene called IGF1R, which has been linked with longevity in humans and mice, might contribute to the tortoises' exceptional life span. They also discovered that the tortoises had more copies of genes related to energy regulation, DNA repair, tumor suppression and immune defense compared with other creatures. While most mammals have only one copy of a gene involved in immune response called PRF1, for instance, both tortoises had a whopping 12 copies in their genome. Generally, having many copies of genes can allow existing functions to occur more efficiently, or provide fuel for the evolution of new functions. The research opens the door to learning more about tortoise biology, too. Dr. Caccone plans to dive deep into the genomes to piece together how giant tortoises evolved traits like gigantism and carapace shape. Genomic data will also aid her efforts to revive two extinct species of Galapagos tortoise. Future avenues of research will only expand as scientists sequence the genomes of more reptiles, said Kenro Kusumi, a professor of life sciences at Arizona State University. There are many lessons to learn from reptiles. They are the closest relatives of humans that can regenerate entire body parts, a trait that could inform medical treatments.","The giant tortoise lived for more than a century, carrying genes linked to a robust immune system, efficient DNA repair and resistance to cancer.",c5c681d0-deed-5d2c-a79e-0b1cfdb43c9b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/08/science/08TB-GEORGE/08TB-GEORGE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b0b9fb065916db71c91767be710217ecf7b09a8052877211632f8adc524057fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Lonesome George was the last known individual of the Galapagos tortoise subspecies Geochelone nigra abingdoni.

Sports,"Olympic Protest Rules: Tweets Are Fine, Kneeling Is Not",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/sports/olympics/olympics-protests-politics.html,"LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The International Olympic Committee is taking no chances. Amid an increase in athlete activism and rising political tensions worldwide, the organization has settled on strict -- and specific -- guidelines for the types of actions, gestures and statements competitors at this summer's Tokyo Olympics will be permitted to make.

No kneeling. No politically motivated hand gestures. No political messages on signs or armbands. And absolutely no disruptions of medals ceremonies. The I.O.C. announced the guidelines Thursday after a meeting of its athlete commission, where the organization's challenge was to balance growing demands from athletes to be able to speak out on issues with ensuring the Games pass without sparking diplomatic incidents.

Many of the guidelines announced Thursday merely codify existing rules. Rule 50 of the Olympic Charter already bars athletes from staging political protests on the field of play or at medal ceremonies. But until now, the guidelines were ambiguous about what constituted a political display.

""We needed clarity and they wanted clarity on the rules,"" said Kirsty Coventry, the chairwoman of the I.O.C. Athletes' Commission, which oversaw the creation of the three-page document explaining what is not permitted. ""The majority of athletes feel it is very important that we respect each other as athletes.""","Walking a fine line on politics and free expression, the International Olympic Committee published guidelines for how competitors can make statements at the Tokyo Games.",4fc4888e-a1c0-54a1-ad35-30669ae2b2c5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/09/sports/09ioc/09ioc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c8911001cc3ed362c5763e5e533b1def52bc983770b7fbbe5b1d147cfef637bf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The American fencer Race Imboden kneeling during a medals ceremony at last summer's Pan Am Games in Peru.,4fc4888e-a1c0-54a1-ad35-30669ae2b2c5,N24News/imgs/4fc4888e-a1c0-54a1-ad35-30669ae2b2c5.jpg,9

But last year, some extraordinary sights and sounds filled La MaMa's intimate East Village theater when it was transformed into a haven for classical Indian music and dance. Beginning Monday, the Drive East festival is back with another week of exceptional programming, organized by Navatman, the South Asian performing arts group, and devoted to the dance styles of Bharatanatyam, Kathak and Kuchipudi, as well as a rarer form: Sattriya, originally practiced by celibate monks.

Other artists include the Bharatanatyam dancers Dakshina Vaidyanathan, who explores connections between movement and the natural world in ""Dance of Nature,"" and Nivedha Ramalingam, an emerging talent. Along with music programs, including ""Afrika Meets India: Afro-India Fusion Music Group,"" in which African and Indian melodic traditions find new ways to mingle, Drive East 2014 hosts 25 performances in all.

Economy,Final 3rd-Quarter Estimate Shows U.S. Economy Growing 2%,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q3-final.html,"The government revised its estimate of economic growth in the third quarter down slightly on Tuesday, as consumer spending helped sustain a modest growth rate despite a dip in net exports caused in part by the stronger dollar. ""The Achilles heels of the second half of 2015 are inventories and trade, which remain a drag on growth,"" said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago. ""The good news is that consumers are showing a willingness to carry the economy into the new year."" At an annualized rate of 2 percent, the pace of expansion in the third quarter was not far out of line with the slow but steady gains registered since the recovery began in mid-2009. Last year, the United States economy -- as measured by changes in gross domestic product adjusted to eliminate the effects of inflation -- grew by 2.4 percent. In 2013, it expanded at a 1.5 percent rate.

Businesses have been cautious about spending, while plunging oil prices have prompted energy companies to cut back on new investments. A weaker trade balance also exerted pressure, reducing growth by 0.3 percentage point. In a separate report on Tuesday, the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of existing homes fell by 10.5 percent in November, an unexpected plunge that the group and private economists attributed to the start of new government rules that may have slowed down mortgage closings. ""We expect delayed sales activity to be recouped in coming months as the real estate industry adjusts to these new regulations,"" Barclays said in a note to clients on Tuesday. For all the blows the economy has absorbed in recent years, it has maintained a remarkably even keel.

Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS, said he was struck by a seemingly obscure but telling data point in the third quarter report: a 2.9 percent increase in final sales to domestic purchasers, which strips out the negative impact of inventory changes and net exports. ""That's a very respectable top line figure,"" he said. ""The economy's underlying growth rate is more in the neighborhood of 3 percent than 2 percent.""
* Elizabeth Holmes Hones Her Defense in Day 2 of Testimony
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. Economists expect the growth rate in the current fourth quarter to be similar to that of the third quarter, with the economy's rate of expansion for 2015 expected to be just over 2 percent. One major source of weakness recently has been the strong dollar, said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. The dollar's rise hurts American companies by making American exports more expensive for overseas buyers. At the same time, the picture for growth in both Asia and Europe remains cloudy. ""Employment has been holding up but the big economic story has been downward pressure from a strong dollar,"" Mr. Slok said. ""And the rest of the world, unfortunately, is still weak.""

Indeed, last week's interest rate increase by the Federal Reserve, which came as some other central banks overseas were maintaining more accommodative monetary policies, could push the dollar even higher. ""The negative effect from inventories is temporary,"" Mr. Behravesh said, ""but weak exports will be part of the U.S. picture for at least another year or two."" Tuesday's revision is the last of three estimates by the Commerce Department of economic growth in July, August and September. The downward adjustment had been expected, with economists predicting before the report that growth would be revised down to 1.9 percent. The first estimate, in October, showed growth of 1.5 percent. That was revised upward to 2.1 percent last month. A fresher take on the economy's prospects will come on Wednesday, when the Commerce Department reports data for consumer spending and income in November. Economists are forecasting a pickup in spending, with incomes growing more modestly.","Economic growth was revised down slightly to 2 percent, from 2.1 percent, the government said in its revision of the data.",f41e2eab-9678-533e-a603-d7b86806233d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/23/business/23ECON/23ECON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=aba9e9a6a73932434c227389e3a361bcd8ab70b4a6e80bcc040ebdc084a559cd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shopping on Black Friday at a Macy's in Manhattan.

Opinion,Colombia Is Dealing With a Terrifying Refugee Crisis. Will Wealthy Nations Step Up to Help?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/opinion/international-world/venezuela-colombia-refugees-crisis.html,"MEXICO CITY -- Venezuela's refugee crisis is the worst Latin America has ever experienced. In the past 15 years, more than five million Venezuelans, equivalent to 16 percent of the population, have left their country. By the end of this year, six million Venezuelans will have fled their country. Only the civil war in El Salvador, a much smaller country, in the 1980s displaced a similar proportion of citizens. Although the diaspora is far-flung, stretching from Spain to Chile, Colombia has borne a disproportionate share of the heavy burden of the influx. One of Venezuela's three continental neighbors, it has taken in the largest cohort of refugees fleeing Nicolas Maduro's dictatorship. In comparison, the United States will accept only 18,000 refugees, from all over the world, this fiscal year. Colombia began giving protection to refugees under its previous government, led by Juan Manuel Santos, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for pursuing a peace agreement with the guerrilla rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. The country's policy of open borders as well as extending health care and protection to Venezuelans continued under his successor Ivan Duque, a right-of-center technocrat, who, at first glance, would not be an obvious candidate for expressing such solidarity with poor Venezuelans -- especially since many of his compatriots are less sympathetic to their plight. The refugees pouring across the border into Cucuta are largely destitute: men, women and children fleeing not only repression and human rights violations carried out by Mr. Maduro, but more significantly, hunger, disease and a lack of basic necessities including medicine. They are running from a crisis that has dragged on for years with no end in sight.

Venezuelan exiles in Spain, Mexico and Doral, a suburb of Miami, are mostly middle-class professionals. But those arriving in Colombia are largely poor. The more than 1.6 million refugees in Colombia, a country of 50 million, as well as the 3,000 that enter each day need a lot of support: papers in order to work, schools for their children, medical care. More than 24,000 children of Venezuelan parents have been born in Colombia in the past few years. The country has offered them citizenship. Mr. Duque is not having an easy time as president. Like Chile and neighboring Ecuador, Colombia has been rocked by protests over transport fares and gasoline increases, inequality, educational deficiencies and an unfair tax system. The teachers' union is demanding higher wages. Thousands have poured into the streets of Bogota in support of the peace agreements that Mr. Duque has been lukewarm toward. Investigations into military misconduct during the domestic strife of the last 20 years are unveiling tragic and embarrassing offenses. So why is a conservative president, beleaguered by protests, behaving in such an unlikely manner toward refugees? First, stopping the flood of people from Venezuela across porous border is nearly impossible without heavy-handed and costly measures. Second, before the Maduro era, it was typically Colombians streaming over the border into Venezuela. Back in the 1970s and '80s, the Venezuelan oil boom attracted as many as two million Colombian immigrants, most of them fleeing the violence of the war with the FARC. Even today, after the peace agreements of 2016, Colombia has more displaced persons inside its territory than any other country in the world excepting Syria. Many Colombians remember that history, making them more willing to welcome refugees.

Finally, there is Mr. Duque's profound dislike for the Maduro dictatorship. Like his mentor -- some say his patron -- former President Alvaro Uribe, Mr. Duque has been in the forefront of multiple attempts to unseat Mr. Maduro or schedule new elections in Venezuela. He could hardly reject or mistreat the victims of a regime he has set out to dislodge. This attitude stands in contrast with that of other South American nations. As Jose Miguel Vivanco, Human Rights Watch Latin America director, declared a few weeks ago, ""The example of Colombia's generous welcome for Venezuelan refugees is admirable and should be followed by Chile, Argentina, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Ecuador and the United States."" Unfortunately, it hasn't. Chile has now begun to demand visas and passports from Venezuelan refugees; most of them lack both. Ecuador, an important pass-through country, now also requires a visa for entry. Peru, with 860,000 Venezuelan migrants, remains relatively hospitable, but has also begun to institute restrictions. Mexico harasses them at airports and land border crossings. Colombia is mostly on its own. International funding for the Venezuelan crisis is meager; the international community has spent less than $1 billion over the past seven years. According to a Brookings Institution study, this translates into $125 per Venezuelan refugee. In contrast, the world has dedicated approximately $1,500 to each Syrian refugee. Washington should help much more than it does, but so should other wealthy nations. The crisis in the region is not that different in size, impact and tragedy from the Syrian one. It is Latin America's greatest humanitarian crisis in years, and the country most affected by it deserves support and aid. Jorge G.

Sports,U.S. Says FIFA Officials Were Bribed to Award World Cups to Russia and Qatar,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/06/sports/soccer/qatar-and-russia-bribery-world-cup-fifa.html,"U.S. Says FIFA Officials Were Bribed to Award World Cups to Russia and Qatar

After years of investigations and indictments, the United States Department of Justice on Monday said for the first time that representatives working for Russia and Qatar had bribed FIFA officials to secure hosting rights for the World Cup in men's soccer. Prosecutors made the accusations in an indictment charging three media executives and a sports marketing company with a number of crimes, including wire fraud and money laundering, in connection with bribes to secure television and marketing rights for international soccer tournaments. The accusations were the latest in a yearslong corruption case that has already produced convictions of numerous soccer officials and executives as well as depositions from former leaders of FIFA, world soccer's governing body. Never before, though, have prosecutors so clearly described the scheme that helped deliver the votes that gave Russia and Qatar hosting rights for one of the world's biggest sporting events. The U.S. prosecutors on Monday explicitly revealed details about money paid to five members of FIFA's top board ahead of the 2010 vote to choose Russia and Qatar as hosts. Russia defeated England and joint bids from Holland-Belgium and Spain-Portugal to host the 2018 men's tournament. Qatar, a tiny desert state that has spent billions of dollars to prepare for the 2022 World Cup, defeated the United States in a runoff by a group of voters that had already been trimmed because two members had been secretly filmed agreeing to sell their votes.

Three South American officials, according to the indictment, received payments to vote for Qatar. One of the officials, Julio Grondona of Argentina, died in 2014. Another, Nicolas Leoz, died in Paraguay last year while under house arrest and fighting extradition to the United States. The third man, Ricardo Teixeira, the former leader of soccer in Brazil, remains in that country, which does not have an extradition treaty with the United States. Leoz and Teixeira were indicted in 2015 on charges related to bribery schemes to sell lucrative soccer rights to sports broadcasters. The U.S. prosecutors also stated in Monday's indictment that the former soccer official Jack Warner of Trinidad and Tobago, who has been fighting extradition to the U.S. since 2015, received $5 million through a string of shell companies to vote for Russia. Some of the money, the indictment said, came ""from companies based in the United States that performed work on behalf of the 2018 Russia World Cup bid."" Rafael Salguero, a Guatemalan soccer official who pleaded guilty in 2016 to money laundering and fraud charges, was promised $1 million to give his vote to Russia, the indictment said. None of the former soccer officials were immediately available for comment. Officials at Russia's soccer federation and FIFA did not reply to an email sent after business hours to request comment.

Qatar has long denied allegations of acting improperly despite facing a slew of accusations since it started bidding for soccer's biggest prize. A FIFA document alluded to the bribery scheme last year. The names of Grondona, Leoz and Teixeira and references to payments they received were included in an ethics document justifying a lifetime suspension of Teixeira from FIFA. The allegations against the South Americans mirror those made by Alejandro Burzaco, a former Argentine television executive who turned state's witness after being named as a central figure in the soccer corruption case. He said at the New York trial of three other officials in 2017 that Leoz, Grondona and Teixeira had been paid to vote for Qatar. More than half the people involved in the votes for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, including the former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, have been accused of wrongdoing, though not necessarily criminally charged.

The choice of Qatar -- a country with such hot summers that five years after the vote FIFA was forced to move the start of the 2022 World Cup to November -- received most of the attention after the votes. But Russia, too, has faced allegations of improper bidding behavior. Russian officials told a FIFA panel that investigated its bid that they could not turn over computers used during the process to a FIFA investigator because they had all been destroyed.

Last May, almost a year after Russia staged the World Cup, Gianni Infantino, who came out of relative obscurity to secure the FIFA presidency after the corruption scandal took down almost all of the organization's senior leadership, received the Order of Friendship medal from President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia. Two of the sports media executives who were charged in Monday's indictments, Hernan Lopez and Carlos Martinez, formerly worked for international subsidiaries of 21st Century Fox. This was the first time the federal government had formally accused Fox, which won the rights to televise the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, or any of its executives of wrongdoing. During the 2017 trial, Burzaco accused Fox of bribing officials, an accusation that the company denied at the time. Lopez, 49, was the president and chief executive of Fox International Channels, and Martinez, 51, was the president of Fox Networks Group Latin America. According to the prosecutors, the pair participated in a scheme that paid millions of dollars in bribes to officials of South America's continental soccer federation, in order to direct how the officials awarded broadcast rights for the Copa Libertadores, South America's premier club soccer competition. They are also accused of using inside information to help Fox win the English-language rights in the United States to televise the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. Lopez and Martinez ""relied on loyalty secured through the payment of bribes,"" according to the indictment. Among other things, the prosecutors said, the bribes helped Fox obtain confidential information ""regarding bidding for the rights to broadcast the 2018 and 2022 World Cup tournaments in the United States."" Through their lawyers, Lopez and Martinez denied the charges and accused the U.S. government of pushing forward a thin case. ""The indictment contains nothing more than single paragraph about Mr. Lopez that alleges nothing remotely improper,"" Matthew Umhofer, a lawyer for Lopez, said in statement. Steven McCool, a lawyer for Martinez, called the charges ""nothing more than stale fiction.""","For nearly a decade, Russia and Qatar have been suspected of buying votes to win hosting rights for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.

Art & Design,New York Galleries: What to See Right Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/21/arts/design/art-gallery-shows.html,"The Lebanese artist Simone Fattal seems to make small ceramic sculptures the way some artists dash off fast, skillful sketches. There's a sense of intoxicating speed and wry pleasure in their loose, sometimes clumsy forms and usually bright uneven surfaces. Like the best drawn sketches, these works also have an uncanny accuracy in their approximations of the real world. The colorful parade of 170 pieces, made from 1988 to 2019 dominating ""Works and Days,"" Ms. Fattal's sumptuous, and first, solo museum exhibition in the United States, conveys a strong sense of ancient cultures, recent wars, personal memory and the erosions of time. Many forms -- which include damaged houses, abandoned walls in deserts and limbless tree trunks -- suggest ruins or relics, as perhaps befits an artist who lived in Beirut during the Lebanese civil war, before decamping to California in 198 0 . Some titles establish meaning, for example, identifying with bitter irony a pile of small glazed gun-like sticks in a possible Quonset hut as ""Weapons of Mass Destruction,"" or imbuing cursory figures with the weight of myth, as in ""Agamemnon,"" ""Siren,"" ""Visitation,"" or ""Warrior."" Other titles simply confirm what the eye may already suspect, as with ""Lion,"" ""Ziggurat,"" ""Turtle"" or ""Window."" Organized by Ruba Katrib, curator at MoMA PS1, this show includes paintings dating back to 1969, some of which, like ""Submerged Landscape"" (1969) are excellent, and several consistently convincing groups of works on paper. Among the best are five large collages dated 2011 to 2016, whose intricate arrays of images teem with the cultural references and personal experiences that Ms. Fattal's sculptures so effortlessly synthesized.

Carrie Yamaoka and Joy Episalla are both New York artists who work in the murky borderlands among photography, sculpture and painting. Their joint show at Transmitter Gallery in Bushwick, Brooklyn, ""The leaden circles dissolved in the air,"" is named for Virginia Woolf's recurring evocation of the striking hours in ""Mrs. Dalloway."" And the objects included -- stained reflective films; a flickering, black-and-white, abstract video installation in a corner -- do all revolve around the passage of time. Because the two artists are also a long standing couple, though, I couldn't help seeing the show mainly as the portrait of a marriage. Two ""foldtograms"" (folded photograms) by Ms. Episalla, more or less crumpled sheets of glossy black photo paper, encapsulate the creative power of commitment. Simply by choosing to keep and display these particular sheets, the artist charges all the little accidents time has inflicted on them -- the wrinkles, the cracks, the discoloration -- with identity and meaning. Ms. Yamaoka's ""untitled photograph 1,"" on the other hand, which shows Ms. Episalla stretched out naked in bed, demonstrates how to be honest about your own limitations: By aiming her camera at a warped piece of reflective Mylar , instead of directly at her partner, Ms. Yamaoka manages to include herself, and her own position, in the picture. She also distorts the whole with handsome wobbles that remind you of the medium's incompleteness and ambiguity without actually interfering with what the piece communicates -- love, trust, obsession, and bravado.

Ed Baynard's biography is exponentially flashier than his floral still-life paintings. He was a graphic designer for the Beatles, a clothing designer for Jimi Hendrix, worked for Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, and appeared in Jack Smith's incendiary underground film, ""Flaming Creatures"" (1963). Nonetheless, this exhibition at White Columns, which encompasses five decades of Mr. Baynard's work, ripples with visual wit and occasional sedition. Mr. Baynard's mainstay was a vase of flowers painted with watercolor in a flat, design-like manner that recalls Japanese Ukiyo-e prints, Alex Katz paintings or Andy Warhol paint-by-numbers compositions. The vases themselves are like trapdoors into other worlds, featuring detailed landscapes or smaller mise en abyme , still lifes within the still life. The contrast between his exciting lifestyle and the staid genre of still-life painting wasn't lost on Mr. Baynard. A framed poster for a 1971 gallery show of his work, which is here, includes a short text by Mr. Baynard in which he ruminates on order versus chaos and structure versus freedom. His paintings swing between these poles: They are tightly structured and yet tiny sparks of chaos -- promiscuous blossoms, rogue washes of paint or a flamboyant frog flying toward the edge of a composition -- erupt within otherwise placidly ordered canvases, suggesting the way subversion or even revolution might emerge from the quietest of quarters.

One of New York's hallmarks is its curbside culture -- the way people leave all manner of items on the street for the taking, such as toasters, baby bathtubs and magazines. Nelson Molina knows this side of the city well. For more than 30 years, the Department of Sanitation worker, now retired, picked up objects left along his route in East Harlem. As his collection grew to fill a whole floor of a sanitation garage, he gave it a name: Treasures in the Trash Museum. For ""What Is Here Is Open,"" the artist and curator Alicia Grullon placed work by seven local artists alongside some of Mr. Molina's treasures, collaborating with him on the installation. The result looks like part art gallery, part thrift store. Shellyne Rodriguez's loving re-creation of the cover of her mother's favorite album by the boogaloo musician Joe Bataan hangs with a mix of LPs. Dominique Duroseau's defiant self-portraits dominate a table crowded with found family photos . Coronado Print Collective has cleverly repurposed an amNew York newspaper box. All the artworks are a step removed from life -- a transmutation of the everyday into something more singular. Their presence casts the intimate, mundane and kitschy objects that surround them as inspiring source material. Together, the treasures and the trash reaffirm a human need to express ourselves creatively, and remind us that making art is just one way. JILLIAN STEINHAUER

Four separate painting shows currently fill as many consecutive rooms at Karma Gallery. What they have in common is a tight focus on the way we take in and construct images. The Glasgow-based Andrew Sim, in the first room, makes gentle pastels with titles like ""A tree with twin trunks."" But by including a yeti and a U.F.O. among these restful scenes, he reminds us that nature, too, is constructed by the imagination. Henni Alftan, born in Helsinki and working in Paris, paints our ideas of how things look -- colorful, sharp-edged, a little flat. (A fine pair of small paintings, both called ""Tiptoeing,"" neatly argue that it's her stockings that shape a woman's ankles and not vice versa.) Matt Hilvers, the show's only American, looks at the strange way words can dance and combine when they're peeled away from the objects they refer to. In ""Culture (Car) (Positioned),"" curving bits of highway spell the word ""Culture"" against a bright, schematic landscape. In the final room, Ruth Ige, who was born in Nigeria and lives in New Zealand, uses figuration like a weight to hold down great swoops of acrylic indigo, cerulean and gray. This figurative weight, though head-shaped and solid black, is the opposite of a silhouette. Its blackness isn't neutral or empty but full and mysterious, a place where gestures and moods concentrate into unknowable density.

Technology,F.T.C. Investigating Twitter for Potential Privacy Violations,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/technology/ftc-twitter-privacy-violations.html,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Twitter said on Monday that it was under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission for potentially misusing people's personal information to serve ads, adding that it faced fines of $150 million to $250 million.

In a corporate filing, Twitter disclosed that the F.T.C. began the investigation last October after it had linked a database of its users' personal information, which it had for security purposes, with a system used by advertising partners.

The action, which Twitter said was inadvertent, may have violated a 2011 agreement that the company signed with the F.T.C. over consumer privacy. At the time, Twitter had agreed to a settlement with the agency after hackers had gained administrative control of the social media service on multiple occasions. Under the agreement, Twitter was restricted from misleading people about the measures it took to protect their security and privacy.

An F.T.C. spokeswoman declined to comment on the investigation.

Brandon Borrman, a Twitter spokesman, said the company was contacted by the F.T.C. after it reported quarterly financial results on July 23. The investigation was disclosed in accordance with ""standard accounting rules"" and was included in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he added.",The social media company said the agency was examining whether it had misused people's personal information to serve ads.,4711ebad-34aa-5e44-9f2c-72ef8de1b48f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/03/business/03twitter/03twitter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=9f34050b4a1f4859e8c18462c0bd83fb79d910f1d311b1f1073aeff25abaacbf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Twitter said it faced fines of $150 million to $250 million in a Federal Trade Commission investigation.,4711ebad-34aa-5e44-9f2c-72ef8de1b48f,N24News/imgs/4711ebad-34aa-5e44-9f2c-72ef8de1b48f.jpg,20
Movies,"For His Second Act, Nnamdi Asomugha Made Preparation His Byword",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/28/movies/nnamdi-asomugha-sylvies-love.html,"The lead in a romance may seem like a prize for most actors, but the star of the new drama ""Sylvie's Love"" had reservations. ""There was no way that I was going to do a romantic film until I read the script and saw that there were Black people falling in love in the '50s and '60s,"" Nnamdi Asomugha, 39, said. ""And then immediately I was like, OK, I think people need to see this film."" ""Sylvie's Love,"" which made its Amazon premiere on Dec. 23, is set largely in midcentury New York and explores the ebbs and flows of the relationship between Robert (Asomugha), a charismatic jazz saxophonist, and Sylvie (Tessa Thompson), a determined television producer.

But before acting and producing, Asomugha was considered one of the best cornerbacks in the National Football League, playing 11 seasons for the Oakland Raiders and other teams before retiring in 2013. It's ""mind-boggling that I would even want to go from one career where you're under such a microscope in an extreme way to another career where the microscope might even be bigger,"" Asomugha said. ""You can't help what you fall in love with, and I fell in love with acting.""

He spoke recently via video about making the transition from football to acting, preparing for ""Sylvie's Love"" (directed by Eugene Ashe) and the unexpected experience of appearing on Broadway. These are edited excerpts from the conversation. You've gone from a successful N.F.L. career to an acting career. What was the timeline for you? I was just obsessed with movies and television growing up. When I finished playing, the advice I kept getting from former players was find something to do that you are absolutely in love with. Because the love you have for it is what will sustain and lead you. And I knew that this was an avenue. I didn't know that it was necessarily going to be producing, but I knew I wanted to go into acting.

Were you still an N.F.L. player when you got bit by that bug, or was this after your career? While I was still in the N.F.L., but I didn't make the decision until probably a year after [retiring]. You go through this period of soul-searching when you finish doing something that you've done for the last 20-something years of your life. It's an identity crisis, like, do I have any more things to look forward to in life? All the traumatic things you tell yourself. On top of that, I knew that I wasn't 20. I wasn't just coming out of Yale or Juilliard. The window felt so much shorter to me. So I didn't want to wait. I wanted to just start creating the projects so people can say, oh, OK, he does know what he's doing. Do you often take lessons and experience from your football career and apply them to your acting career? I advise people all the time, get your kids into sports because sports shaped my life -- from discipline and patience and hard work and falling down and needing to get back up and not complaining. But the No. 1 thing I think is the preparation. The same preparation I need to get ready for a football game or football season, I've brought that to acting.

When did you start playing football? I was 12. The first year I played football was the last year I played the piano. One day, I was late for practice and my coach said, where were you? I said I'm sorry, I had a recital. And he laughed so hard. It was this big thing and I had to run laps. That was the last time I ever played the piano. And that was the start of my football career. It was both devastating and also affirming. Like, OK, I need to focus on this. This is going to be what I do now.

You found your way back to an instrument. Did you have to learn how to play the tenor saxophone for ""Sylvie's Love""? I didn't have to, but I chose to because I love preparation. I love the process more than anything, sometimes even more than the actual moment. I got a saxophone coach who was also in the film and we played for just over a year. And I learned that I was really good at playing the saxophone. I say ""was"" because I haven't played it in a while, so I've lost a lot of that. But I wanted it to look authentic. The film is set during the civil rights movement in America. But with these two Black characters and an almost entirely Black cast, the backdrop isn't politics, it's jazz. We see some of those elements play out but that wasn't the focus. Can you explain the intent behind that? It was important for us to make those elements nuanced and not in your face. We wanted to focus on the love. We've been so defined by that period as Black people. We know about marches and protests and water hoses and dogs and struggle. But we were also falling in love. We were having families, getting married, going to the dance. My father-in-law says we used to go to ""the dance,"" we didn't call it the club. We had that as a part of our culture of Black people and to not celebrate that is a crime. It robs us of our humanity and just an entire aspect of our lives that really helped us get through those difficult moments. So for us, the thought was, why not show that? Why not illuminate the love that we had for each other during this time period? And it also was a reason some people passed on making the film because they felt like it should have been rooted in the civil rights movement. But that wasn't the film we wanted to make. We felt that there was an audience for not just Black love, but love in general. What are some moments from the film you hope resonate with viewers? I think it was really important for us to show a level of vulnerability in men, especially Black men.

I produced ""American Son,"" but as actors, there's no plan as of now for that collaboration. We're very supportive of each other's journeys, but we've always been that way. We always want the best for each other in whatever we're doing. And so it's not in the detail of specific things; It's just an overall appreciation for the hard work. Do you hope to do more plays on Broadway? I had no dream or aspiration of being on Broadway. I didn't know that doing plays was going to be in my cards at all until I did an Off Broadway play and I fell in love with being on the stage. And then the next year, for me to be on Broadway in ""A Soldier's Play"" and to be in a role originated by Denzel -- I was just like, what is happening?","The former pro football player has pushed himself in acting classes, onstage and in films.

Travel,A Concierge for Same-Sex Weddings in Florida,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/14/travel/lgbt-gay-marriage-fort-lauderdale.html,"His wedding-planning passion extends to his own life. He's getting married in Ireland this year, as an ode to the heritage of his partner, Richard Durant.

Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Semple.

Q. How did you become a wedding concierge?

A. I've had a great opportunity to work with some of the most talented decorators, photographers and entertainers throughout my 30-plus-year career in the hospitality industry and 23 years in South Florida. Since then, I've built relationships through networking and involvement with groups like the Gay Chamber of Commerce, the Greater Fort Lauderdale Chamber and the Pride Center at Equality Park. So that's how I got the resources to create celebrations.

Was there a wedding that was particularly memorable?

I hosted a wedding in May for two women. One is an artist, and everything she did for her wedding was hand painted. There were personal touches on everything, from favors to place cards to gifts for her guests. Her partner, though, was the handier one. They had a beach theme, so she built props like a hand-painted surfboard and an Adirondack chair with their names engraved. She built a guesthouse for family coming from Paris.

And one that was emotional for you?

A couple I've known in the community for many years came to me about having a simple yet elegant reception. The two had different ideas or surprises they wanted to wow the other with. The simple reception turned into this spectacular party because each had surprises that the other knew nothing about. I felt so emotional because I could see how committed couples that have been together for 30-plus years are to each other -- especially now that they have the opportunity to be recognized.","Mark Semple, a veteran hospitality professional, talks about his job as the wedding concierge for B Ocean Resort in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.",1433f845-c065-5294-9665-1594c2187610,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/14/travel/14QA/14QA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=cecbb6890409fbfde79eebadc08a02051c23a8cae113e11fc0a39d7025267e04&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mark Semple serves as the wedding concierge for B Ocean Resort Fort Lauderdale, an L.G.B.T.-friendly resort in Florida.",1433f845-c065-5294-9665-1594c2187610,N24News/imgs/1433f845-c065-5294-9665-1594c2187610.jpg,4

Music,"Steve Grossman, Hired as a Teenager by Miles Davis, Dies at 69",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/21/arts/music/steve-grossman-dead.html,"Steve Grossman, a saxophonist who caught the jazz world's attention when he was recruited by Miles Davis at just 18, died on Aug. 13 in Glen Cove, N.Y. He was 69.

His younger brother and only immediate survivor, Myles, said the cause was cardiac arrest.

Mr. Grossman was playing at the Village Gate in Manhattan in 1969, just a year after entering the Juilliard School, when Davis walked in. Mr. Grossman was virtually unknown at the time, but Davis -- an astute judge of talent whose sidemen over the years included John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, Keith Jarrett and other future stars -- decided that he wanted him in his band.

Mr. Grossman, who played tenor and soprano saxophone, joined at an opportune moment. Davis had recently finished recording the album ""Bitches Brew,"" a watershed in the fusion of jazz and rock, and his music was beginning to find a larger and younger audience.

Mr. Grossman had big shoes to fill. He replaced Wayne Shorter, considered by many to be one of the greatest saxophonists and composers in jazz history. Mr. Shorter, who had been with Davis since 1964, had left to form the band Weather Report with the keyboardist Joe Zawinul.",He was just 18 when Davis recruited him to play saxophone in his band.

Television,'South Side' and 'Sherman's Showcase': Two Flavors of Nostalgia,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/23/arts/television/south-side-shermans-showcase-review.html,"The writers, producers and performers Diallo Riddle and Bashir Salahuddin like to cover their comedic bets. On Wednesday, Comedy Central is premiering ""South Side,"" their amiable new sitcom set in the working-class Chicago neighborhood of Englewood. But wait, there's more: The following Wednesday, IFC is premiering ""Sherman's Showcase,"" their high-concept vaudeville act that takes the form of a tribute to a fictional variety show at the intersection of ""Soul Train,"" ""Laugh-In"" and late-night cable-access.

While the two shows look nothing like each other, there are some constants in the Riddle-and-Salahuddin approach. Their humor, while clever and with a satirical edge, is embracing and to a large degree universal -- they're more interested in pointing out foibles than in retailing grievances (particularly in ""South Side"").

Complementing that stance is a worldview that feels thoroughly nostalgic. ""South Side,"" about a pair of best friends and recent community-college graduates with aspirations -- the 10-episode season largely charts their efforts to find more gainful employment than their jobs as furniture repossessors -- is set in the present day of mint lattes and bitcoin. But its rhythms and relationships are thoroughly traditional, carrying on a sitcom legacy running from ""Sanford and Son"" and ""Good Times"" through Aaron McGruder's ""Black Jesus"" to ""Rel,"" the Lil Rel Howery series also set on Chicago's South Side. (Howery has a supporting role in ""South Side"" as a fellow furniture-store employee and abrasive antagonist to the easygoing heroes.)

""Sherman's Showcase,"" meanwhile, is a pure jolt of stylized nostalgia, from its affectionate sendups of soul, R&B and hip-hop to its candy-colored sets with their abstract cutouts, traversed by roller-skating dancers. ""American culture peaked in 1973,"" proclaims the host of the show within the show, Sherman McDaniel (Salahuddin). ""Anything after that is a [expletive] lie.""",One is an affectionately traditional sitcom; the other is a metafictional history of four decades of pop culture. Both were created by Diallo Riddle and Bashir Salahuddin.,1f839868-26d6-593d-ac00-6ed73f3ecb5d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/23/arts/23southsherman-review-2/23southsherman-review-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bafe7ea98d2e176f8183aab18b45f7d3191d009f3830cb0744ecac94dce36555&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Sultan Salahuddin, Chandra Russell and Kareme Young in ""South Side,"" one of two new shows created by the writers and performers Diallo Riddle and Bashir Salahuddin.",1f839868-26d6-593d-ac00-6ed73f3ecb5d,N24News/imgs/1f839868-26d6-593d-ac00-6ed73f3ecb5d.jpg,3
Music,"Yes, We Need (Yet) Another Rachmaninoff Recording",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/arts/music/daniil-trifonov-rachmaninof.html,"The standard repertory in classical music is often standard for good reason: Great works are gifts that keep on giving with repeated hearings.

But what about repeated recordings? It's one thing to hear young pianists take on Rachmaninoff's mighty Third Piano Concerto in concert, with its in-the-moment excitement. But do they really need to record it?

After all, the market is saturated with several dozen recordings. I grew up with Van Cliburn's classic live one from Carnegie Hall, with Kirill Kondrashin conducting the Symphony of the Air, shortly after Cliburn had become an overnight superstar after winning the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.

Just three years later, Byron Janis, another young American, recorded the concerto with Antal Dorati and the London Symphony Orchestra, a performance some Rachmaninoff devotees consider even better. And the exhilarating, exhausting discography piled up, with spectacular older accounts by Horowitz, Kapell, Argerich and others, and more recent ones by Leif Ove Andsnes and Evgeny Kissin.

Dance,Review: Compagnie CNDC-Angers Dances Cunningham,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/12/arts/dance/review-compagnie-cndc-angers-dances-cunningham.html,"What will happen next? Why is she falling back into his arms when he's sitting there minding his own business? Who would have expected that man with his legs spread eagle on the floor to scurry across it? Why does that group of people stand motionless and then all switch position in a way that transforms them? Why did the mood just change and then change again because of movement alone? The dancing that occupies the stage of the Joyce Theater this week is just dancing. It prompts questions like those above; it supplies no answers. Nobody argues, nobody falls in love, nobody dies. Yet it's pervaded by mystery, drama, wit and, above all, suspense. The choreographer is Merce Cunningham (1919-2009); and to watch this 75-minute ""Event,"" an anthology of his dances performed by the Centre National de Danse Contemporaine, from Angers, France, under the direction of Robert Swinston, is to see again the essential theatricality of Cunningham's work. This program confirms he was one of the supreme choreographers of the 20th century; he remains the greatest choreographer of the 21st century. But it shows Cunningham was a master of theater, too. His work is difficult to watch in the way that the plays of Beckett, Ionesco and Pinter are -- and rewarding in the same way. His choreography, too, might have been called the Theater of the Absurd because of its non sequiturs, its avoidance of psychological explanation or narrative completeness and its rhythmic concentration of language: in his case, dance language. His dances, though, are much more than studies in absurdism; at their heart is an ardent fascination in human energy, rigorously expressed. The mind behind it is always investigative, tough, wry, sensuous, making ""What if?"" experiments and conjuring unanticipated patterns and harmonies from them.

There are eight dancers in this Angers group: four women, four men. They're given a wide range of ensembles -- the compositional fun of several trios and quartets often brings the mood into comedy -- but it's a particular pleasure to see the rich supply of male-female duets on display here. This is a form in which Cunningham's invention flowered throughout his career (he trained in ballroom idioms in his youth); something in the juxtaposition of female and male inspired him, more or less invariably, to poetic drama. The duets here remind us that Cunningham often makes as much of a woman's independence as her dependence. In an image during one pairing, the woman's leg soars and her body plunges. The man kneels beside her like a safety net, framing her head and torso with his arms, but does not touch her. Several duets show us man and woman seemingly on different wavelengths: He partners her, or she takes a position while holding onto him, but they are facing in different directions, like a couple. They might at times be a couple who cohabit without always communicating. Sometimes, despite the cool performing manner, the movement is itself funny. In one of those duets in which man and woman seem at close quarters but in separate orbits, he's holding her as if by accident; but suddenly he hops backward and pulls her into hopping after him. It's so unexpected you want to laugh out loud, and yet the duet gives us no time for any single reaction. In other duets, man and woman are in sympathy, sharing the same impulse but expressing it in different parts of the body. He, kneeling, abruptly contracts his lower abdomen; she, balanced on one leg, bends it at the knee.

The stage is decorated on three sides by strips of individually colored, patterned fabric that billow in a soft breeze; designs are by Jackie Matisse. The dancers are dressed attractively in shades of gray: mottled, sleeveless hip-length tunics and paler tights below. Music, played live by John King and Gelsey Bell, covers a spectrum of sound from tintinnabulations to surreal soprano warbling (Ms. Bell) and noises like an engine's and propeller's made strangely lyrical. Most of the eight performers deliver Cunningham with what may be called a French accent. All have good stage faces and feet, and carry themselves elegantly; no French dancer ever enters the stage as if by accident. In matters of rhythm, turnout of the legs, placement of the hips and use of the torso, at least four don't have the rigor of the Cunningham dancers we used to watch when there was a Merce Cunningham Dance Company. (It closed at the end of 2011, following his behest as stated soon before his death in 2009.) But they're all committed and personable, and one, Anna Chirescu, is first-rate; several would surely have caught Cunningham's eye and respect. At all points, they give us the choreography; their manner is both selfless and self-revealing. I could identify excerpts from ""Squaregame"" (1976), ""Fractions"" (1978) and ""Points in Space"" (1986); a more complete list is supplied in the Joyce program. But an ""Event"" is not a quiz. Among the fascinations of this one was how it drew me back as aspects of Cunningham's work in the 1980s. (Mr. Swinston joined the Cunningham company in 1980.) The Cunningham of that era often seemed to be conducting a private dialogue with the two choreographers who influenced him most, and from whose idioms he departed most strongly: Martha Graham and George Balanchine. Here again were Graham-related contractions of the torso, but without the Expressionist emphasis that in Graham so often becomes tedious; instead these contractions become pure dance. Here again were Balanchine choreographic devices -- four men partnering one woman in an extreme version of supported adagio, for example -- but tweaked, so that the men dance among themselves when not partnering her. How wonderful to be brought the great American dance past by dancers from France. Rich and enthralling fare.","The French troupe Compagnie CNDC-Angers performed ""Event,"" composed of Cunningham pieces arranged by Robert Swinston, at the Joyce Theater.",d999fb4e-b83a-58a3-bc2e-1c4853905279,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/12/arts/12CNDC/12CNDC-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=a0d2d6ca21d3284c64c9e802811c095cf0034324dab309736ff87b4d27e1074a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The French company Compagnie CNDC-Angers, including Anna Chirescu (illuminated in back), danced ""Event,"" composed of pieces by Merce Cunningham and arranged by Robert Swinston, at the Joyce Theater.",d999fb4e-b83a-58a3-bc2e-1c4853905279,N24News/imgs/d999fb4e-b83a-58a3-bc2e-1c4853905279.jpg,6
Economy,"Fed Lowers Its Forecast for Growth, but Takes No Steps",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/03/business/economy/fed-holds-rates-and-strategy-steady.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve significantly reduced its forecast of economic growth through 2013, acknowledging that it had once again overestimated the nation's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. Despite the bleak forecast, however, the Fed said that its policy-making committee had decided against taking new measures to stimulate growth at a two-day meeting that concluded Wednesday. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said that the central bank already was pushing hard to spur growth and create jobs. ""We have taken a lot of actions,"" Mr. Bernanke said at a news conference after the announcement. He added that Congress, by contrast, was not doing enough to pull the levers of fiscal policy. Lawmakers are gridlocked over a new jobs proposal from the White House, and a special bipartisan committee charged with reducing the deficit is struggling to reach agreement by Thanksgiving. ""I think it would be helpful if we could get assistance from other parts of the government to help create more jobs,"" Mr. Bernanke said.

The central bank predicted that the economy would expand 2.5 percent to 2.9 percent in 2012, well below its June projection of 3.3 percent to 3.7 percent. For the following year, 2013, the Fed predicted growth of 3 percent to 3.5 percent, down from a range of 3.5 percent to 4.2 percent. The unemployment rate, it predicted, would still be at least 8.5 percent at the end of 2012, at least 7.8 percent at the end of 2013 and at least 6.8 percent at the end of 2014. Such reductions probably would come in part from people abandoning the search for work, rather than those finding new jobs. The unemployment rate was 9.1 percent in September. The government will release October figures on Friday. This is a difficult time for the Fed and its chairman. Republicans charge that the central bank's existing efforts have gone too far, sowing future inflation. Democrats say that in hesitating to do more, the Fed is ignoring the plight of more than 25 million Americans who cannot find full-time work. And the sluggish pace of growth, which continues to fall short of the Fed's predictions, is a bright marker of its failure to stimulate a recovery. Mr. Bernanke on Wednesday sought to argue that the Fed was trying to get things just right in maintaining a delicate but necessary balance between competing concerns about inflation and unemployment. He said that Republican critics were ignoring the Fed's record. Five years into the crisis, there is no sign of inflation.

But Mr. Bernanke also gave little satisfaction to liberal critics. This meeting tested what the Fed was willing to do when the economy was merely muddling along, and the answer that came back: Nothing new. Asked several times why the Fed had paused if jobs are a problem and inflation is not, Mr. Bernanke offered a description but not an explanation: The Fed is willing and able to do more, he said, just not right now. The Fed's economic forecasts do not have a particularly good track record, but since they are based on individual forecasts submitted by the 17 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making board, the numbers do offer a window into the state of their minds. In a word: glum. The Fed's assessment of the economy was slightly brighter than after the last meeting in September. The committee's statement noted that growth has ""strengthened somewhat"" since summer thanks in part to increased consumer spending. But there is still a hole in the economy where housing used to be, and the unfolding financial crisis in Europe continues to shadow the domestic economy. The statement again noted ""significant downside risks to the economic outlook, including strains in global financial markets."" Still, the decision to pause won the support of nine of the 10 voting members of the committee. The one dissent came from Charles Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, whose vote echoed his recent speeches in which he has criticized the Fed for caring more about inflation than unemployment. It was the first time since 2007 that a board member had dissented in favor of doing more. The limiting factor appears to be inflation. The Fed projects -- as do financial markets -- that prices and wages will rise about 2 percent a year, the level that the Fed considers healthy. Mr. Evans and outside critics want the Fed to trade a higher rate of inflation for reductions in unemployment. But Mr. Bernanke and a majority of his colleagues believe that this would unsettle the dearly bought belief that the Fed will keep inflation slow and steady.

The pressure to reconsider that stance has been eased by recent data, including the estimate that growth rose to an annual pace of 2.5 percent in the third quarter. There is also the question of what Congress will do: Further cuts in spending, or a decision to end the payroll tax holiday, would strengthen the case for the Fed to start new aid programs. A plan to pay down the debt would have the opposite effect. These considerations have suspended for now any movement toward a new round of stimulus, like the proposal by the Fed Governor Daniel K. Tarullo that the Fed should resume buying large quantities of mortgage-backed securities to reduce the cost of mortgage loans, increasing demand for housing. ""While I do not shirk the responsibility of the Fed having to do what it can to meet its mandate, obviously a broad range of policies can affect growth and employment,"" Mr. Bernanke said. ""I hope that there will be a range of actions that will complement and supplement the Federal Reserve's efforts."" Mr. Bernanke indicated that the Fed does plan to expand in the near future the information that it provides about its outlook and policies. Such information can increase the power of those policies. For example, convincing investors that the Fed intends to maintain interest rates near zero for a longer period will tend to drive down rates on long-term loans -- which are set in large part based on expectations about future short-term rates -- thereby reducing the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers. A simple change would involve publishing the Fed's predictions for the future level of the short-term interest rates, which it controls directly and has already said that it plans to hold near zero through mid-2013. Diane Swonk, an economist at Mesirow Financial in Chicago, said the Fed could show greater concern for job creation by tying such a forecast to the unemployment rate, announcing that it would keep short-term rates near zero until unemployment dropped below 7 percent, provided that inflation remained under control. ""This is how you would move toward it,"" Ms. Swonk said, referring to Mr. Bernanke's mention of the issue during his news conference. ""And I think that that is exactly where they are heading.""",The Federal Reserve said it remained concerned about the United States economy over the next two years but announced no new stimulus measures or rate changes.,f2035b9f-f81f-5b96-a95b-f6686a7f05a4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/03/business/alt-FED/alt-FED-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=b29ebbfe5d7506fcff8bce4108cec5a534d4a8ad6dde1b5175d563b3975efff2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Ben S.

Health,A Chance to Expand Medicaid Rallies Democrats in Crucial North Carolina,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/27/health/covid-medicaid-north-carolina-election.html,"RALEIGH, N.C. -- North Carolina, a crucial battleground for the presidential race and control of the United States Senate, has another coveted prize at stake in this election, one that is drawing serious out-of-state money, dominating television ads and driving get-out-the-vote efforts. Democrats believe they have a chance of gaining control of the State Legislature for the first time in a decade, which would make it possible to expand Medicaid to cover half-a-million more low-income adults here after years of Republican resistance. The health care issue is paramount up and down the ticket in North Carolina, with left-leaning national and in-state groups using it to motivate Democratic voters -- especially those who stayed home in 2016. Many of them belong to the demographic who would become eligible for Medicaid, the free government health insurance program, if the legislature voted to expand it as the Affordable Care Act allows.

Ms. Blalock, 54, who volunteers with a national group fighting for a higher minimum wage, has cataracts in both eyes that have worsened to the point where she can barely read the order screen at her job. She was approved for temporary Medicaid recently to pay for urgently needed cataract surgery, but it won't cover anything else and she longs for permanent coverage. ""I'm not going to say I've been a faithful voter, but it's important for a lot of things,"" she said. ""For what I'm going through right now. For the minimum wage, for health care."" Preserving the A.C.A. overall has been a rallying cry for Democrats across the country as the coronavirus sickens millions of Americans and the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments next month in a case seeking to overturn the law, also called Obamacare. The Trump administration is actively supporting the case, and President Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court, Amy Coney Barrett, has criticized past decisions to uphold it. Of the many state clashes over whether to expand Medicaid since the A.C.A. passed a decade ago, few have been as pitched as North Carolina's. Here is where supporters have conducted hundreds of ""Moral Mondays"" protests at the State Capitol, where the Republican mayor of a town that lost its hospital walked all the way to Washington to build support for Medicaid expansion and where, for the past four years, Gov. Roy Cooper, a first-term Democrat who has a comfortable lead in his re-election race, has failed to push it through the Republican legislature despite making it a top priority.

The state is one of 12 remaining -- all with Republican or divided leadership, most of them in the South -- that have not expanded the Medicaid program. Two years ago, Democrats flipped enough seats in the North Carolina House and Senate to break Republican supermajorities that had been in place since 2010, when Republicans won control of the legislature for the first time in more than a century due in no small part to a voter backlash against Obamacare. Now, Democrats need to pick up six seats in the House and five in the Senate to claim the majority, including in some districts where Republican support is strong. It is hardly a fait accompli, but new court-ordered district maps last year and an influx of Hispanics and college-educated people from the Northeast have made more races competitive for Democrats. So far, about a quarter of the state's flood of early voters did not cast ballots here in 2016, Strategists say the State Senate is more within reach, but even winning one chamber could put enough pressure on Republican lawmakers, some of whom have already come to support Medicaid expansion and even introduced a bill to allow it with conditions, to accomplish it. ""Even if we aren't able to flip these chambers, running up the margins will absolutely have an impact on the policy debate and force Republicans to come to the table on this,"" said Christina Polizzi, national press secretary for the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee. She pointed out that a similar dynamic led to Medicaid expansion in Virginia in 2018. Several Democratic candidates trying to flip seats said the issue had come up repeatedly in conversations with voters. Sarah Crawford, who is running for an open Senate seat in a district outside Raleigh, recalled talking to a voter recently who was supporting President Trump because she opposed abortion, but said she would vote for Governor Cooper, the incumbent Democrat, and for Ms. Crawford, because ""'Medicaid expansion would really benefit our family.'""

Earlier this year, the Poor People's Campaign released a study by a Columbia University researcher that found only 46 percent of potential voters with family incomes less than twice the federal poverty line voted in the 2016 presidential election. In comparison, the study found, 68 percent of those with family incomes more than double the poverty line voted. If low-income registered voters cast ballots at the same rate as higher-income voters in 15 states that went to Mr. Trump in 2016, including North Carolina, they would match or exceed his margin of victory in those states, the study found. And for many, access to health care has been an elusive goal, often with devastating consequences. In an interview, Dr. Barber said the coronavirus pandemic had turned that lack of access into a crisis. ""Covid has forced the conversation about health care,"" he said. ""There's no way you cannot talk about it."" Dr. Barber is quick to remind his audiences in North Carolina that Senator Tillis helped lead a successful effort in the legislature to pass a law prohibiting Medicaid expansion in 2013, when he was the speaker of the House of Representatives. The Poor People's Campaign has recruited more than 5,000 volunteers in eight states ""who are committing to call over one million poor and low-wage people who did not vote last time, are willing to be poll watchers, or are going to canvas in communities with their face shields and masks and gloves,"" he said, ""because it's a matter of life and death in the real sense."" Jessica Holmes, a Democrat running for commissioner of labor, said such efforts were motivating people like her 84-year-old grandmother, who she said has never voted in a presidential election until now. ""We're in the greatest medical crisis of many of our lifetimes,"" Ms. Holmes said, ""and yet all across North Carolina we're talking about selling hospitals or clinics closing.""","The legislature in this battleground state could flip to Democratic control, a prospect that is bringing out lower-income voters who stayed home in 2016.",c3ef7e27-6601-55c0-b926-8a802a2b3a3e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/23/science/00NC-MEDICAID3/00NC-MEDICAID3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b90cfddd8df3fc7e1f8882fc083ee1c9ee32e54c880d5fe919f61df2a880bd2c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Sarah Crawford, a Democrat running for state senate in North Carolina's 18th District, cheered on voters at the Knightdale Recreational Center.",c3ef7e27-6601-55c0-b926-8a802a2b3a3e,N24News/imgs/c3ef7e27-6601-55c0-b926-8a802a2b3a3e.jpg,1
Opinion,China's Arms Buildup Threatens the Nuclear Balance,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/29/opinion/russia-china-nuclear-weapons.html,"Nuclear arms control is at a crossroads -- not because we are approaching the deadline on an extension of the 2010 New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, but because China's nuclear expansion threatens to upend decades of relative nuclear stability between the United States and Russia. The United States and Russia have been reducing their strategic nuclear arsenals since the end of the Cold War. The 1991 Start Treaty allowed each side 6,000 deployable strategic nuclear warheads; the 2010 treaty, known as New Start, lowered that limit to 1,550 operationally deployed strategic nuclear warheads. But stability at these lower force levels will be challenged by China's nuclear ambitions. China is clearly moving away from the small, limited nuclear force of its past. It is fielding modern land- and sea-based strategic systems and plans to introduce an air-launched ballistic missile delivered by heavy bombers in the near future, achieving its own strategic nuclear triad. The Defense Intelligence Agency estimates that China will at least double the size of its nuclear arsenal over the next decade and is building the production capacity to expand it further. Given China's secrecy about its nuclear forces, and its manifestly aggressive strategic intentions, this nuclear expansion may go even further, well beyond Beijing's old ""minimum deterrence"" doctrine.

Still, it is in China's interest to reverse its dangerous nuclear buildup, lest it set off a nuclear arms race involving the United States and Russia, and perhaps encourage other nuclear powers to increase their forces to keep pace. Meanwhile, the United States is replacing its aging nuclear weapons systems. Our intention is to remain within the New Start limits of 700 strategic missiles and bombers and 1,550 deployed strategic warheads. But as Chinese nuclear forces grow in size and sophistication, the United States will have no choice but to reassess and adjust its own nuclear force requirements. In the past, the United States classified China's small nuclear arsenal as a subset of U.S. nuclear force requirements, which have been largely driven by the Soviet and then Russian threat. But this will not remain the case if U.S. nuclear forces remain at historically low levels and China's continue to expand with no discernible constraint. And the less we know about what China is doing and why, the more the United States must rely on worst case scenarios to size its nuclear forces accordingly. China's nuclear expansion and its refusal to engage in meaningful dialogue will affect stability on multiple levels. Increased U.S. nuclear force requirements to ensure credible deterrence against China would affect the United States-Russia strategic nuclear balance and threaten to undermine the prospects for further negotiated reductions. We should assume that Russia will also assess the implications of China's expansion.

The American special envoy for arms control, Marshall Billingslea, made these points to his Russian counterpart during a meeting in June in Vienna. Russia should clearly see its own self-interest in helping to bring China into discussions on arms control. These talks need not focus on making China part of an extended New Start agreement. But renewing the treaty for the United States and Russia without conditions for bringing China into a broader arms control process carries risks for future security, even if today it seems the easiest course to take. All the great powers must be invested in such a process. We ask China to recognize its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to negotiate in good faith on limiting and reducing nuclear arms and, more generally, to take steps toward greater transparency. Transparency is important to foster greater trust and lessen the chance of miscalculation during a crisis. That first step is joining the United States and Russia at the table in Vienna. Those of us charged with ensuring the defense of the United States call on Congress and our allies to help make the case to Russia and China that it is in the interests of all nations to broaden the current arms control framework to verifiably limit the nuclear weapons of all three major powers to secure a more stable and prosperous future.","A Pentagon leader argues that as Beijing's weapons grow in size and sophistication, the U.S. and Russia will have to reassess their own arsenals.",db4a0a42-fdaf-5a60-9d8c-7502b1a3b736,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/31/opinion/29Anderson/29Anderson-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=300c69151853b0988a2e2837f63b214aa6e57ff58ab8d074101e641975f1599b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Military vehicles carrying DF-41 intercontinental nuclear missiles during a parade in Beijing last October.

Art & Design,"Made Before the Boston Tea Party, This Teapot Cost $800,000",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/arts/design/met-museum-teapot-auction-bartlam.html,"SALISBURY, England -- In this sedate cathedral town in the west of England, an old teapot with a missing lid and a repaired handle sold at auction Tuesday for 575,000 pounds with fees, or about $806,000. The winning bid was made in the room by Roderick Jellicoe, a London dealer, on behalf of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, after a tense eight-minute duel with an American private collector bidding by telephone. The presale estimate had been PS10,000 to PS20,000. Clearly, this was no ordinary teapot. The auctioneers Woolley & Wallis had recently attributed the piece to John Bartlam, an enterprising potter who produced blue-and-white-decorated soft-paste porcelain at the Cain Hoy factory in South Carolina in the late 1760s. The Staffordshire-trained Bartlam left England for South Carolina, drawn by its plentiful supplies of local kaolin clay and its wealthy consumers, according to the salesroom catalog. In the past 10 years or so, following archaeological excavations at the site of his factory, scholars have recognized that Bartlam's porcelain was the first to be produced in America, predating the better-known Bonnin and Morris wares made in Philadelphia from 1770 to 1772. This Salisbury auction house was therefore offering what is thought to be the oldest known American porcelain teapot. ""It's extraordinarily important for many, many reasons,"" said Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, the Anthony W. and Lulu C. Wang curator of American decorative arts in the American Wing of the Met. The teapot's use of local clays ""represents the entrepreneurial spirit of 18th-century America,"" Ms. Frelinghuysen said.

The manufacture of porcelain, prized for its hardness and translucence, was perfected in China by the 10th century. The technique was only mastered in Europe in about 1710, when Johann Friedrich Bottger made the first true porcelain at the Meissen factory in Saxony. The first major English porcelain factory was established in the Chelsea area of London in the 1740s. ""You don't expect something that good to stroll in on the back of a general sale,"" said Clare Durham, the head of Woolley & Wallis's English and European ceramics department. Ms. Durham was referring to how the $806,000 teapot had been entered by a longstanding private client who had acquired it in 2016 with a speculative online bid of about PS15, or $20, at an antiques auction in Lincolnshire, England. ""If it hadn't been for that internet bid, it probably would have ended up in a bin,"" Ms. Durham added. Subsequent research by Ms. Durham revealed that the teapot's Chinese-style ""man on the bridge"" decoration exactly matched that of two saucers in a six-piece tea service sold at a regional auction in England in 2002. Then cataloged to be by the Isleworth factory in England, they were later identified as being by Bartlam, based on comparison with porcelain fragments excavated in South Carolina. At least five of those pieces have now been acquired by American public and private collections. One of them was a tea bowl, which resold at Christie's in New York in 2013 for $146,500.

Bartlam gave the printed decoration of the teapot a distinctively American slant by including two sandhill cranes beneath a Sabal palmetto tree, both of which are indigenous to South Carolina. It remains a mystery, however, as to why the only surviving items of Bartlam porcelain discovered so far have been found in England. Ms. Frelinghuysen, the Met curator, and others have suggested that a Bartlam tea service might have been sent to England for promotional purposes. ""In America they would have thrown away old porcelain, but in England it would have had novelty value,"" said Mr. Jellicoe, the successful bidder. ""Maybe that's why someone hung onto it.""

The rest of this 342-lot Salisbury ceramics auction was truer to the form of the mainstream Western porcelain market, in which huge quantities of antique pieces sell for relatively modest sums, if at all. Five lots before the Bartlam teapot sold, a blue and white teapot of about the same date, retaining its lid, but made in Worcester, England, rather than in America, sold for PS500, or about $700. A dozen lots of 18th-century Bow porcelain figures, with estimates ranging from PS400 to PS1,500, failed to sell. ""The market has changed,"" said Michele Beiny, a specialist dealer in rare European porcelain who is based in New York. ""Ceramics were more widely collected 50 years ago, and prices were higher."" Perceptions that old ceramics were ""granny's taste,"" a minimalist abhorrence of clutter and a decline in formal dining at home have all contributed to porcelain's falling out of fashion among collectors.

But specialists are hoping that the Met's $800,000 acquisition of the Bartlam teapot, and Christie's coming auctions in the spring of the collection of Peggy and David Rockefeller, will reinvigorate the market. Estimated to raise at least $500 million for Rockefeller charities, the sale will include more than 350 lots of opulent European porcelain. Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller had a taste for porcelain services, particularly those decorated with flora and fauna. These were bought mainly in the 1950s, '60s and '70s from dealers such as the Antique Porcelain Company, founded by Ms. Beiny's grandfather Hanns Weinberg and J. Rochelle-Thomas. They were used for dinners at the Rockefeller houses in New York City and Pontacino Hills, N.Y. according to Peter Johnson, the Rockefeller family historian.

""When it came to porcelain, David had a lot of trouble controlling himself,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""When he bought paintings, he was more judicious."" The porcelain was purchased ""to be part of their daily lives,"" Mr. Johnson added, recalling that Henry Kissinger and the Shah of Iran were among the luminaries who ate off the Rockefellers' plates from prestigious factories such as Sevres, Meissen, Spode and Chelsea. More than 60 services will be offered by Christie's. Estimates reflect current market values, rather than the prestige of the former owners, said Jody Wilkie, Christie's co-chairman of decorative arts. ""We want the porcelain to raise money for Rockefeller charities,"" she said. The most obviously desirable of these lots is a 28-piece Sevres ""Marly Rouge"" service made for Napoleon I, circa 1807-1809. Painted with the butterfly and insect motifs much loved by David Rockefeller, this is officially estimated to sell for $150,000 to $250,000. Even this seems a relatively modest valuation, given the ever-enduring cult surrounding Napoleon. In November, a single plate from the emperor's so-called Quartiers Generaux service sold for 40,000 euros, or about $49,000, at the French auction house Osenat at Fontainebleau, near Paris.","The teapot, which the Metropolitan Museum of Art bought at auction, is said to represent the ""entrepreneurial spirit"" of 18th-century America.",3e798900-849a-5a56-add2-66de11ab99ec,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/28/arts/28reyburn-02/28reyburn-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=365af718d23d7b873b9774992fe241d2bd89f563f3119b39181bfafbcf9398ee&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"This teapot, made in the 1760s, is thought to be the oldest American porcelain teapot in existence.

Books,"Keith Botsford, Man of Letters and Saul Bellow Associate, Dies at 90",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/14/books/keith-botsford-dead.html,"Keith Botsford in 1990. He was a novelist, essayist, journalist, biographer, memoirist, teacher, translator and co-founder, with Saul Bellow, of three literary magazines. He also composed chamber works, a ballet and choral music.

Keith Botsford, a globe-trotting, multilingual and multifaceted man of letters who became a longtime collaborator with Saul Bellow, died last year, on Aug. 19, in London -- a death that drew little public notice at the time. He was 90. His death was noted two days later by The New England Review of Books on its website and, 16 days later, in a 25-word paid death notice in The Boston Globe, but it was otherwise not reported widely. The Times of London published an obituary two months later, and the Boston University alumni magazine, Bostonia, noted his death in its recent winter-spring issue. Mr. Botsford was professor emeritus of journalism at the university's College of Communication and had lived, and written, in Costa Rica for some time. The New York Times learned of his death on Thursday while updating an obituary about him that had been prepared in advance in 2014. Reached on Saturday, his son Gianni confirmed the death. Mr. Botsford was a fluid, prolific writer unfettered by the boundaries of form or genre. He was a novelist, essayist, journalist, biographer, memoirist, teacher, translator and founder, with Bellow, of three literary magazines, most recently News From the Republic of Letters.

A Renaissance man, he also composed chamber works, a ballet and choral music, and was fluent in seven languages and able to read a dozen. While teaching comparative literature and French in the early 1950s at Bard College in the Hudson Valley, Mr. Botsford attended a cocktail party that changed the course of his life. A budding novelist in his mid-20s at the time, he looked across the room and saw a fellow faculty member in a predicament. ""It was Saul Bellow, and he was pinned against the wall by a dreadful man from Winnipeg,"" Mr. Botsford recalled in an interview for this obituary in 2014. ""I had just read 'The Adventures of Augie March,' so I walked up and started talking to him."" Bellow, by then in his late 30s, had taken a teaching post at Bard in 1953, the year ""Augie March,"" his breakthrough novel, was published.

Dismayed that literary magazines of the day were, by their lights, either too chic or too academic, the two friends founded one of their own, The Noble Savage, which made its debut in 1960. Ralph Ellison, Arthur Miller and Wright Morris, among others, wrote for its first issue. It later published a couple of unknowns, Thomas Pynchon and Robert Coover, before ceasing publication after five issues. They followed The Noble Savage with another literary magazine, ANON, in 1970; it lasted just one issue. They put out the first issue of News From the Republic of Letters in 1997, featuring in its pages an excerpt from an unpublished Bellow novel, ""View From Intensive Care."" Bellow called the magazine, published twice a year, ""a tabloid for literates,"" and said that he and Mr. Botsford were ""a pair of utopian codgers who feel we have a duty to literature."" The magazine took its name from Nouvelles de la Republique des Lettres, first published in 1684 by the French philosopher Pierre Bayle. It introduced new and newly discovered writings from American and international writers, both celebrated and obscure, including fiction and nonfiction, memoir, correspondence, biography, poetry, essays and reviews. Writing under the Bayle-inspired byline ""P. B.,"" Mr. Botsford contributed sharp opinions on everything from drone attacks to crime fiction. Agatha Christie, to his way of thinking, ""can't write for toffee."" The magazine continued publication until at least 2008. In 2001, Mr. Botsford and Bellow edited ""Editors: The Best From Five Decades,"" a 1,000-page mosaic of stories, poems, articles and essays by writers as diverse as Victor Hugo, Martin Amis, S. J. Perelman and John Berryman, most of the material never before published in book form. Editing provided Mr. Botsford with a welcome respite from the rigors of writing. ""I found editing myself difficult and being edited by others humiliating,"" he wrote. ""I got around this by editing others with generosity and rewriting with humility."" He called translation ""the supreme exercise of mastering someone else's style."" In his journalism, Mr. Botsford was equally at ease writing about movie stars, concert pianists, bullfighters, novelists and race drivers. Formula One racing and the Boston Red Sox were two of his passions, along with literature, music and food.

His interest in bullfighting led him to write a biography of the celebrated Spanish matador Luis Miguel Dominguin (1926-96), whom Ernest Hemingway profiled in his nonfiction book ""The Dangerous Summer."" In the biography, published in 1972, Dominguin was quoted as dismissing Hemingway as ""a commonplace bore"" who ""knew nothing about fighting bulls."" Mr. Botsford's opinions could be just as barbed. He once wrote of the French composer Olivier Messiaen: ""Messiaen is the Al Gore of music. That is, he sells a brand of French intellectual sanctity that I will do a great deal to avoid."" The critics were generally kinder toward Mr. Botsford's work. He began his career by producing four largely autobiographical novels. The fourth, ""The March-Man,"" is a multivoiced narrative about Franklin Carey, a man, much like his creator, who inhabits the border regions between the cultures of Europe and America. Writing in The Times in 1964, Haskel Frankel called Mr. Botsford ""a writer of sure stylistic control and great technical skill."" In all, Mr. Botsford produced some two dozen novels, including crime and espionage tales written under pseudonyms.

His formal education began in English boarding schools, but his family was forced to leave Europe for the United States as World War II loomed. His parents soon divorced, and his schooling continued in California and at Portsmouth Priory School in Rhode Island (now Portsmouth Abbey School). He entered Yale but left before graduation to enlist in the Army. By his account he served as a spy in Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Mr. Botsford received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa in 1949 and a master's in French literature from Yale in 1952. He also studied composition at the Manhattan School of Music, Japanese at Columbia University and law at the University of Strasbourg in France and at Holborn College in London. His teaching, translating, writing and administrative jobs took him all over the world, from New York to Boston, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, London, Paris and Istanbul. He said his most rewarding jobs were his stints as deputy international secretary of the writers association PEN; director of the Center for Translation Studies at the University of Texas, Austin, where he also taught English; and assistant to the president of Boston University. His half-century friendship with Bellow was, he said, another high point. ""We had an intellectual love for each other,"" Mr. Botsford recalled. He said he had helped Bellow write his acceptance speech when Bellow was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1976, and he visited Bellow's bedside shortly before he died. Bellow's last words to him, he said, were, ""One good thing in my life was that I loved you."" After Bellow's death, Mr. Botsford visited southeastern Costa Rica at the urging of one of his sons, Joshua, a chef, and ended up building a house there on a lush tropical plot overlooking the Caribbean Sea. (His wife at the time, Angela Carol Fellows, a molecular biologist 52 years his junior, continued to live in Boston.) Designed by Gianni Botsford, a London-based architect, the house, dramatically angular, featured all-local timber, a corrugated metal roof and a breezy central room dominated by a grand piano and a wall of books. (He had shipped 17,000 of them there from Boston, he told The Times in the 2007 interview, for an article about the house.) The house was known as Casa Ki-ke (pronounced KEE-kay), a common local mispronunciation of the name Keith.

Mr. Botsford's three marriages -- to Ann Winchester and Nathalie Favre-Gilly as well as Ms. Fellows -- ended in divorce. In addition to his son Gianni, he is survived by his children Aubrey, Clarissa, Joshua, Flora, Matthew, Polly and Thomas, all with the surname Botsford; 16 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Xenia, died soon after her birth. Whether writing fiction, journalism or biography, Mr. Botsford always kept the reader in mind. For this he thanked Bellow: ""As my dear friend Saul Bellow put it to me, 'Take the reader by the hand, Keith, and he will follow you anywhere.' Or as I tell my students, 'You are not writing for me, but for the world. Or at least for your Aunt Nellie in Boise, Idaho.' ""","He was an uncontainable writer (novelist, essayist, biographer and more), started magazines with Bellow and died almost a year ago, to little public notice.",4f4a70c5-c1c1-5114-8642-6174d43394b4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/16/obituaries/16BOTSFORD-obit1/14BOTSFORD2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=89b20547d70d0d43899e5149d04485ce1ad2c260c260cd17f82a74949537b760&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. Botsford in a photo accompanying the release of his novel ""The Eighth-Best-Dressed Man in the World,"" published in 1957.

Health,A Contentious List of Finalists for Global Aid Fund Group's Director,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/health/global-fund-aids-tuberculosis-malaria-director.html,"Three candidates to become the next director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are likely to draw harsh scrutiny from the fund's largest donor, the United States. The nominating committee of the fund's board on Monday produced a report naming the three finalists and its rationale for picking them. A copy of the report was made available to The New York Times. While all might have been considered excellent candidates for the job in earlier years, global health officials are worried that their backgrounds could push the Trump administration away from historical commitments to the fund. One candidate, in particular, has used Twitter posts to call Mr. Trump a fascist, saying he has much in common with ISIS for his anti-Muslim stance.

A spokesman for the Global Fund said on Wednesday that it considered all three candidates ""skilled and highly experienced,"" that none would be asked to withdraw and the election would proceed as scheduled on Feb. 27. The four-year term of Dr. Mark Dybul, the current executive director, ends on May 31. A senior United States government official said administration global health officials received the three candidates' names Monday evening and had not yet met to discuss them. The fund, which estimates that it has saved 20 million lives since it was founded in 2002, is well respected. In December, Britain's foreign aid agency gave it top grades on a ""value for money"" assessment of 38 aid organizations to which it donates. But the fund has long struggled to raise money. It was originally hoped that donors would commit $10 billion a year. Instead, it gets less than $5 billion. The United States has always donated a third of the fund's budget and is by far its greatest source of support.

The finalists, selected from a preliminary list of nine, are: Dr. Muhammad Ali Pate, a former health minister of Nigeria; Subhanu Saxena, a drug executive who in August stepped down as chief executive of Cipla, a major Indian pharmaceutical company; and Helen Clark, a former prime minister of New Zealand who ran the United Nations Development Program. Dr. Pate, a former World Bank health specialist, is a visiting scholar at Harvard's Chan School of Public Health. He has held several Nigerian government jobs, including health minister, for which he was praised for improving primary care, training midwives to cut maternal and child mortality, and fighting polio. The nominating committee's report noted misuse of funds at one health agency run by Dr. Pate, but said there was ""no suggestion of impropriety on his part"" and that anticorruption measures he had put in place were not followed after he left. In July, however, Dr. Pate posted on Twitter a New Yorker article called ""Being Honest About Trump,"" including this summary, ""To call the presumptive Republican Presidential nominee a fascist of some variety is simply to use a historical label that fits."" In December 2015, Dr. Pate, a Muslim, shared a series of articles on Twitter critical of Mr. Trump's call to ban Muslims.. He shared an article that noted condemnation of Mr. Trump's call by British and French leaders in The Washington Post. Another post, using a headline with a column in Time by Kareem Kareem Abdul Jabbar, the retired basketball star, said ""Donald Trump has more in common with ISIS than America."" Mr. Saxena is a business executive brought up in Britain. He worked for Citicorp, ran PepsiCo operations in Africa and Russia, and was a longtime executive for Novartis, a pharmaceutical conglomerate with headquarters in Switzerland.

He was responsible for increasing production of CoArtem, a malaria drug that is a mainstay of the Global Fund and the President's Malaria Initiative, begun by President George W. Bush's administration. From 2013 to 2016, he was chief executive of Cipla, the Indian drug company that is one of the Global Fund's biggest suppliers. He stepped down in August, citing ""family priorities."" The report noted that, although he was a businessman, he had worked with governments, regulators and medical charities like Doctors Without Borders. Yet American officials may look askance at the hiring of an executive from a large pharmaceutical company for whom the Global Fund has been a major customer. By 2015, six million Africans were receiving antiretroviral drugs made by Cipla. Ms. Clark was elected to New Zealand's Parliament in 1981 and was prime minister from 1999 to 2008. She became the administrator of the United Nations Development Program in 2009 and was, according to the report, ""a reformer, driving much greater organizational efficiency and a major decentralization."" The Trump administration has expressed hostility toward United Nations programs. Internal memos obtained by The New York Times show the new administration has considered cutting its support for United Nations' international operations by at least 40 percent. Yet the development program has never been a particular target of American conservatives, who tend to criticize the United Nations cultural organization, population planning agency and peacekeeping operations.

Several people familiar with the fund's search for a director expressed dismay over the choices, worrying that each might jeopardize support from the United States, but none would speak for attribution. One described himself as distressed; another worried that the candidates had not been adequately vetted. Seth Faison, a spokesman for the fund, argued that no candidate should withdraw. ""Lots of people said things about Trump during the campaign that now are working with him,"" he said of Dr. Pate. Of Mr. Saxena and Ms. Clark, he said, United Nations connections and business connections were unavoidable in virtually any candidate not from a major donor country. The director does not oversee buying from drug companies, he said, and the fund gives money to many recipients, including $300 million to United Nations Development Program and $800 million to Nigeria. ""Anyone who ever worked in any government that got funds from the Global Fund would be off limits, which is not realistic,"" he said. A director could recuse himself from decisions with potential conflicts, he said, and a different fund representative could approach the United States during the next appeal for donations, which typically occur at three-year intervals.","The backgrounds of finalists to lead the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria are likely to draw scrutiny from the United States, its largest donor.",6547a32d-c62d-57b6-8511-b9875c63d625,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/16/science/16global-1487194796818/16global-1487194796818-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9a17768155694fb6e9562fca1d82a2456c92dd164c226b3debb9d380fa109cdd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Helen Clark, former prime minister of New Zealand, is a candidate for director of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.",6547a32d-c62d-57b6-8511-b9875c63d625,N24News/imgs/6547a32d-c62d-57b6-8511-b9875c63d625.jpg,1
Science,A Black Hole's Lunch Provides a Treat for Astronomers,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/24/science/black-hole-ligo-gravitational.html,"An artist's impression of the mysterious cosmic object, which weighs about 2.6 solar masses and lies 780 million light-years away -- or did, until a black hole consumed it.





Astronomers announced today that they had discovered something new out in the dark: a stellar corpse too heavy to be a neutron star -- the remnant of a supernova explosion -- but not heavy enough to be a black hole. Whatever it once was, it is long gone. About 780 million years ago -- and 780 million light-years away -- it was eaten by a black hole 23 times more massive than the sun. That feast left behind an even heavier black hole -- a vast, hungry nothing with the mass of 25 suns. News of that event only recently reached Earth, in the form of space-time ripples known as gravitational waves. These evanescent vibrations were felt on Aug. 14, 2019, by an array of antennas in Italy and the United States called the International LIGO-Virgo Collaboration, and the results were published on Tuesday in Astrophysical Journal Letters. According to a theory that has been the backbone of decades of astrophysical excitement, a star can wind up in one of three final states, depending on its mass: a perpetually cooling cinder known as a white dwarf; a dense star, with the mass of a couple of suns compressed into a ball only 12 or so miles wide, known as a neutron star; or a black hole, a beast reluctantly predicted by Albert Einstein to be so dense that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity.

The victim in this collision weighed in at 2.6 solar masses, according to the LIGO-Virgo calculations. That is heavier than the accepted limit of 2.5 suns for a neutron star. But the lightest black hole ever measured was about five solar masses. So the mystery object lies squarely in what astrophysicists call the ""mass gap."" Astronomers have long wondered what, if anything, could occupy this astronomical no-man's land. ""We've been waiting decades to solve this mystery"" Vicky Kalogera of Northwestern University, one of the main authors of the paper, said in an interview. ""We don't know if this object is the heaviest known neutron star or the lightest known black hole, but either way it breaks a record."" She added: ""If it's a neutron star, it's an exciting neutron star. If it's a black hole, it's an exciting black hole."" In a statement issued by the Science and Technology Facilities Council in Britain, Charlie Hoy, a graduate student at Cardiff University and Dr. Kalogera's co-author, said, ""I did not believe the alert when I first saw it come through.""

The LIGO observatory made history in 2016 when it detected gravitational waves from a pair of colliding black holes, proving the existence both of gravitational waves, a century after Einstein predicted them, and of black holes. The instrument consists of twin L-shaped antennas in Hanford, Wash., and Livingston, La. Since then, LIGO has been joined in its exploration of the darkness by another antenna known as Virgo, in Cascina, Italy. The combined LIGO-Virgo Collaboration consists of about 2,000 scientists around the world. The alphabetical listing of their names and institutions takes up the first five and a half pages of the new paper. The puzzling collision recorded last August was one of 56 possible gravitational wave events -- most of which appear to be black hole collisions -- detected during the observatory's third run, which went from April 2019 until March 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic shut down most scientific activities around the world. The collaboration is still reviewing the data in an effort to analyze and confirm them. Dr. Kalogera said that the event was exciting for several reasons. The ratio of the two colliding masses was the most extreme -- nine to one -- of the gravitational wave collisions that have been observed so far. Astronomers have difficulty imagining how such unmatched stars could get together in a binary double-star system to begin with. ""This is very hard for formation theories to explain,"" she said. The signal -- a characteristic ""chirp"" caused by the colliding objects circling faster and faster as they approach their moment of ultimate doom -- lasted about 10 seconds. ""Due to the favorable circumstance of having observed such a loud signal with quite different component masses and for about 10 seconds, we achieved the most precise gravitational-wave measurement of a black hole spin to date,"" Alessandra Buonanno, of the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam, Germany, said in a statement issued by the institute. A black hole's spin carries important information about the birth and evolution of the black hole, Dr. Buonanno noted. In this case, it revealed that the black hole was spinning ""rather slowly,"" less than one-tenth the rate allowed by the strictures of Einstein's theory. Nobody had any immediate explanation or candidate for what kind of entity could fill this mass gap -- a ""dearth,"" Dr. Kalogera called it -- except to affirm that the calculations were robust.

Gordon Baym, an expert on neutron stars at the University of Illinois, pointed out that the collision of a pair of neutron stars in 2017, which produced a cosmic fireworks spectacle, left behind a neutron star with about 2.7 solar masses, thus briefly occupying the mass gap. But that object is thought to have collapsed into a black hole almost immediately. Most well-measured neutron stars have masses of around 1.4 suns, Dr. Baym said, and only a handful have masses more than two. In theoretical calculations, he said, ""it is very hard to make matter stiff enough, using reasonable physics,"" to conjure a neutron star in the range of 2.6 solar masses. Daniel Holz, an astronomy professor at the University of Chicago who is a member of the LIGO collaboration, but not one of the principal authors of this paper, mused that neutron stars and black holes are in some sense ""polar opposites."" ""A neutron star is composed of the densest matter in the universe, and is in some sense the ultimate star,"" he said in an email. ""A black hole is just warped space and time. It doesn't even have a physical surface! And the interior of a black hole is in some sense not even part of our universe, since nothing can come out of it."" He added: ""What is astounding is that, despite their profound differences, in this particular case we can't tell which is which!"" All the clues disappeared into the resultant black hole. ""So we're not sure if this object is a neutron star or a black hole, and either way it's exciting and we learn something new,"" Dr. Holz said. ""It's a win-win! Lots of theorists are now sharpening their pencils to try to explain what we've seen.""

Movies,10 Great Movies at the New York Film Festival You Can (Mostly) See Online,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/movies/new-york-film-festival-best-movies.html,"This year's edition of the Lincoln Center staple is going virtual and to the Bronx -- but there is still plenty to watch.

Of course it isn't the same. If this were an ordinary year, the 58th edition of the New York Film Festival would give us plenty to be grateful for (and gripe about) amid mad dashes to Lincoln Center. Although much about this year is familiar -- many movies, few stars, some reliably long running times -- little else is. Most of the event, starting Thursday and running through Oct. 11, is being presented online, which will make the program available to a national audience. This Manhattan-centric festival is also getting out of the nabe, with drive-in screenings in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. The sociable rituals of lining up, buying snacks and shushing fellow cinephiles have been suspended for now, but the movies are still here, including those that offer inevitably nostalgic, prepandemic glimpses of New York and other cities. And the festival has held onto its identity, with restored classics, familiar auteurs and a strong roster of documentaries. Two nonfiction standouts, Garrett Bradley's ""Time"" and Michael Dweck and Gregory Kershaw's ""The Truffle Hunters,"" played at Sundance. Other selections echo the Cannes that might have been and the Toronto that sort of is. Needless to say, we miss New York as it was, but we're glad to share this selection of movies you shouldn't miss. The opening-night film, directed by Steve McQueen, is part of an Amazon series (called ""Small Axe"") on the lives of West Indian immigrants living in Britain at different times in the postwar era. Looser and warmer than his best-known features (""Widows,"" ""12 Years a Slave""), ""Lovers Rock"" administers a welcome antidote to the deprivations of quarantined life. The proper way to describe this 68-minute delight would be to say that it's about a house party in London in 1980, where Martha (Amarah-Jae St. Aubyn) and Franklin (Micheal Ward) catch each other's eyes and fall into each other's arms. But really, the movie is the party, and you feel less like a spectator than like a participant, intoxicated by the hints of danger, the pulse of the music and the tantalizing possibility of love. (A.O. Scott)

Pitched between practice and theory, David Dufresne's documentary takes a dialectical look at the Yellow Vest movement that erupted over economic injustice in France in 2018 and resumed just last week. The title is borrowed from the sociologist Max Weber, who in 1922 defined the state as a political institution that claims ""the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force."" The limits of that monopoly are explored in the movie, which combines video from often violent protests with commentary from intellectuals and activists watching along with you. The results are very French, but the protest, violence and arguments are wholly identifiable. (Manohla Dargis) A prodigious pig, a one-legged chicken and a herd of lissome cattle are at the center of this extraordinary, palpably intimate look at the everyday lives of a group of animals. Working in black-and-white and with nimble, fluid cameras that sometimes skim the ground, the Russian filmmaker Victor Kossakovsky shows a world that most people never notice or care to understand, one that respects other living creatures and sees, really sees, their distinct behaviors and relationships. To an extent, the movie reflects the issues that John Berger broached in his 1970s essay ""Why Look at Animals?,"" which mournfully weighed what has been lost as humans have increasingly severed their ties with animals. ""Everywhere animals disappear,"" Berger wrote. ""In zoos they constitute the living monument to their own disappearance."" (M.D.)

Between the March on Washington in the summer of 1963 and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s assassination nearly five years later, the F.B.I. subjected him to continual surveillance on the orders of its director, J. Edgar Hoover. The tapes, now in the National Archives, will be unsealed in 2027, and in the meantime Sam Pollard has assembled an engrossing, unsettling documentary. The voices of historians, veterans of the fight for civil rights, and former F.B.I. employees are heard over archival footage that retells a familiar story as a blunt fable of state power and a nuanced essay on the fallibility of heroes and the ethics of historical inquiry. Rigorously focused on the facts of the past, the movie is also as timely as an alarm clock. (A.O.S.)

What is the opposite of social distance? It might be Frederick Wiseman, whose documentaries are epics of social proximity, serenely and thrillingly observant chronicles of how people behave in shared spaces. Wiseman's latest pays an extended visit to Boston's City Hall, and with his characteristic attentiveness he looks in on weddings, news conferences, office routines and, above all, meetings. There are few things in life I enjoy less than sitting in meetings, but few things I relish more than watching them in Wiseman's movies. He turns bureaucratic procedure into a kind of poetry, and finds both comedy and profundity in the banal idioms of governance. ""City Hall"" also provides a powerful and precise account of what democracy looks like beyond the rhetoric of campaigns. In Martin Walsh, Boston's phlegmatic, sometimes tongue-tied mayor, Wiseman finds an unlikely and blessedly uncharismatic hero. (A.O.S.)

Drawn from Jessica Bruder's book of reportage about Americans who live on the road, Chloe Zhao's new film is as much a character study as an examination of social conditions. Frances McDormand plays Fern, a widow whose Nevada hometown has shut down along with the local industry. She finds community among fellow ""rubbertramps"" -- wanderers who have, by choice or necessity, cast off the routines of career-focused, consumerist existence. Many of these nomads play themselves, lending a poignant, relaxed, lived-in texture to Fern's adventures. There is sorrow in this story, but not a shred of pity, and a complex and powerful political argument drifts in as if on a desert breeze. (A.O.S.)

The lives of artists are often narrated as a struggle that almost invariably ends in success, even after death. The Indian director Chaitanya Tamhane takes a more complex approach to a familiar story in this elegiac, graceful drama, which tracks its title subject, a Hindustani classical singer (a vibrant, empathetic Aditya Modak), as he tries -- and tries -- to become worthy of both his teacher and the music itself. Filled with soaring musical passages, the movie is finally a meditative, unsparing if compassionate exploration of the ineffable chasm between inspiration and industry, between greatness and the desire to be great.

Jia Zhangke has been a mainstay of this festival for nearly 20 years. In his fictional features (including ""A Touch of Sin"" and ""Ash Is Purest White""), he traces the transformation of China's post-Mao landscape and society through the lives of representative characters. His documentaries reach further back, into the memories of ordinary people who lived through the upheavals of the nation's post-revolutionary decades. The latest examines the evolution of a village in the northern province of Shanxi. Old-timers remember an unsanitary backwater notorious for its unmarriageable men, a startling contrast with the modern consumerist bustle captured by Jia's camera. How did it change? The answer is found in a complicated weave of progress and loss, in changes etched in the faces of people given the time and attention to explain what they have seen. (A.O.S.) Elegant, dryly funny and quietly moving, Hong Sang-soo's latest is organized around three conversations. Over the course of a fleet 77 minutes, the peripatetic heroine, Gamhee (the wonderful Kim Min-hee), visits a handful of other women, each with spectacular views and many thoughts about their lives and that of their ever-patient and gracious visitor. Fruit is carefully peeled, alcohol consumed, a plump cat nobly defended and worlds beautifully explored. The mood is ruminative, the filmmaking effortless. (M.D.) Midway through Spike Lee's delightful documentary of the David Byrne lollapalooza that opened on Broadway in 2019, I found myself swaying in my living room. Well, how did I get here? The music, of course, but also Lee's dynamic filmmaking, which translates the stage show to the screen with swooping camera movements and precision-timed editing that perfectly serves the songs, the performances and outstanding choreography. Play it loud (and often)! (M.D.) The New York Film Festival runs through Oct. 11, largely online.

Television,"Trump Sands Down the Edges, at Least for a Night",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/arts/television/president-trump-state-of-the-union-speech.html,"Let's be honest: It was not the state of the union that anyone was curious about ascertaining from Donald J. Trump's address to Congress Tuesday night. The interior state of the president, on the other hand, has been a yearlong topic of interest, revived recently by the dishing in Michael Wolff's ""Fire and Fury"" and by Mr. Trump's reported vulgar insults toward Africa and Haiti during a meeting on immigration. The White House treated the speech as a chance to reset the agenda, not just about his policy, but about Mr. Trump's personality. So for his first State of the Union address, someone switched the usual president with decaf. Sounding reserved (and a bit hoarse), sticking (mostly) to his prepared text and punctuating his own speech with loud, staccato slaps of applause, Mr. Trump attempted the music, if not necessarily the lyrics, of comity.

The speech began with some traditional elements that reliably bring across-the-aisle applause: tributes to American heroes -- first responders in natural disasters and the mass shooting in Las Vegas -- and to Rep. Steve Scalise (""the legend from Louisiana""), who survived a shooting at a congressional baseball practice. He also opened with calls for unity -- ""We always will pull through together, always"" -- which contrasted with repeated network cutaways to congressional Democrats, seated and often glaring. Reminders of disunity were never too far away. When Mr. Trump praised a guest, 12-year-old Preston Sharp, for arranging the planting of 40,000 flags at military graves, he added that it was a reminder of ""why we proudly stand for the national anthem"" -- a none-too-subtle allusion to his divisive attacks on NFL players over protests during the national anthem. This acoustic version of Mr. Trump did not come across warmer, except in moments of exchange with heroes and grieving parents in the audience. Mr. Trump was a TV performer for years, but he is not, like Ronald Reagan, an actor. He doesn't modulate his tone. He just keeps his chin stuck out and speaks slower, in a half-whisper, like someone trying to have an argument in a quiet restaurant.

Last year, when Mr. Trump addressed a joint session of Congress and stuck to his script, he was hailed by analysts as finally having become presidential. The next weekend he was on Twitter, accusing Barack Obama of having conspired to ""tapp my phones"" during the campaign. A year later, we know that this president can only be counted on to pivot in the sense that a Tilt-a-Whirl can. Even the Fox News round-table noted that it did not come off as the bipartisan ""olive branch"" hinted at earlier in the day.

But if the State of the Union cannot be taken as a reliable guide as to who Mr. Trump is, it is a useful guide to how he wants to be seen. This speech sought to project the image of someone who can keep his cool to viewers who tune out day-to-day politics. There are probably fewer of that group than usual, given how un-tune-out-able Mr. Trump's outbursts and the news cycle has made him. This administration is like ""Scandal"": The plot changes every commercial break. The hour before the speech, the cable networks largely skipped the usual previews to cover new reports on the Russia investigation. Even the usual pageantry was affected by Trump-drama subplots. The arrival of the first lady, Melania Trump, was noted by commentators who pointed out that she arrived separately, and that her white suit resembled those worn by Democratic women at last year's speech -- the subtext, seemingly, being recent reports of strife in the couple's marriage.

The counterprogramming, too, was busy, reflecting the throng of Democrats jockeying to be the counter-voice to Trump. There was the official party response -- Representative Joseph P. Kennedy III of Massachusetts at a Fall River, Mass., vocational school, a car competing with the congressional backdrop -- but the planned responders also included Representative Maxine Waters (on BET) and Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont (on social media). There will be other rebuttals and contradictions. Some of those may eventually be issued by the president's less low-key self, tweeting as he watches ""Fox & Friends."" But this speech is who Mr. Trump is on paper -- or on the prompter screen -- until his next episode.","Sounding reserved and sticking (mostly) to his prepared text, President Trump attempted the music, if not necessarily the lyrics, of comity.",6bd5b3ed-0c7f-5472-b794-371d082b0f1f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/31/us/politics/31sotu-notebook/31sotu-notebook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=e57e40a12ef618def17a9a32121b033a21890e88345426c7d571d8438fc4c1fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump delivered his first State of the Union address at the Capitol on Tuesday.,6bd5b3ed-0c7f-5472-b794-371d082b0f1f,N24News/imgs/6bd5b3ed-0c7f-5472-b794-371d082b0f1f.jpg,3
Global Business,Kazakhstan Oil Field Begins Production After Years of Delay,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/business/global/kazakhstan-oil-field-starts-production-after-years-of-delay.html,"MOSCOW -- After years of delay, the largest oil field outside the Middle East started producing crude on Monday, offering a valuable new deposit to meet the world's rising energy needs.

The first oil to flow from the Kashagan field, in Kazakhstan, was just a trickle. But a consortium of oil companies, including Exxon Mobil and ConocoPhillips of the United States, have ambitious plans to increase production over the next several years.

""This is one of the most complicated projects in the world,"" Claudio Descalzi, the chief operating officer for exploration and production at Eni, the Italian oil company involved in the project, said in a telephone interview. ""It's really an historical moment. It's first-quality oil, very light oil, and we are close to countries that are growing, and that present the best markets.""

When geologists discovered the field in 2000, it was the largest new deposit since the discovery of the Prudhoe Bay field on the North Slope of Alaska in 1968. And it remains so today, suggesting that such oil sources are becoming harder to find.","The initial production is just 26,000 barrels a day, but eventually the project could yield 1.5 million barrels a day, about what Libya produces.",a640c445-f20f-5d42-adb1-20251a31ea98,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/12/business/Oil/Oil-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=320&w=600&s=77cc32dbf82bfc942b24e6f95ac3584fea067c3b1ceab7bb0a4a362182738563&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"The Kashagan oil field in the Caspian Sea produces 26,000 barrels a day, but could yield up to 1.5 million barrels a day.",a640c445-f20f-5d42-adb1-20251a31ea98,N24News/imgs/a640c445-f20f-5d42-adb1-20251a31ea98.jpg,24

""He also knew that hurricanes could be so bad that nothing could live through them.""

Collective strength and collective mourning live alongside each other in the path of storms like Florence. It's unsettling, even from thousands of miles away, to consider the weight of nature's wrath and to marvel at how communities come together in their wake, to fix what's broken, to save what's left. In tragedy, we are rarely a divided nation.

Today, then, would be a good one to cook for others, even if they weren't or aren't in harm's way, to take note of how in giving to others we make our little worlds stronger and more full of joy.

Consider the Consequences of Failing,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/02/your-money/want-to-keep-new-years-resolutions-consider-the-consequences-of-failing.html,"James O'Connor of Far Hills, N.J., who works in asset management, said after the wear and tear of decades of commuting and working, he has committed to doing his second Ironman Triathlon in November.

Want to Keep New Year's Resolutions? Consider the Consequences of Failing

THE New Year's resolutions are still new. And a cynic -- or realist, given past performance -- might say many of them will fail by spring, if not sooner. Even so, the resolutions return every year, particularly the big three: getting in shape, becoming better at work and improving our financial lives. All three have something else in common: There are financial and economic consequences when someone fails to keep them, just as surely as there are financial and economic benefits to success. And people who can tie their resolutions to real consequences, psychologists, doctors and even health club owners say, have the best chance of success. ""People typically succeed because their 'why' is bigger than their 'but,'"" said Elizabeth Lombardo, a wealth psychologist in Chicago.

As an example, she said, ""I want to work out, but I have no time."" Getting past the ""but"" is not easy. That's why so many of the resolutions fail. To succeed, the resolution makers are going to need a combination of more help, lower expectations and bigger consequences than most imagine. DIETS AND EXERCISE Steve Stanulis, an actor, playwright and retired New York City police officer, needs to lose 30 pounds for work. Weight loss, not surprisingly, is a common resolution. But for Mr. Stanulis, failing to lose the weight would result in an embarrassing artistic and financial failure for the revival of a play he's in this spring about a male stripper. ""The problem is the last time we did that play was in Las Vegas in 2013,"" he said. ""I'm 42 now. I have three kids. I'll be the one who looks ridiculous being fat and 40 up there."" Still, Mr. Stanulis, who once owned a gym on Staten Island, is aware of how tough any self-improvement resolution can be.

""Most people give themselves unattainable resolutions,"" he said. ""As a gym owner, you'd have people come in and say, 'I smoke two packs a day. Last night, on New Year's Eve we went out with a bang and I smoked six packs. I've decided I'm quitting smoking.' That lasts for a hot minute."" He used to counsel people to try cutting their smoking habit in half. And for himself, he has done something similar: Instead of going on a strict diet, he went to a doctor who uses data to show people how what they eat affects them medically. When it comes to a fitness goal, the mind-set is slightly different. James O'Connor, 44, who lives in Far Hills, N.J., and works in asset management, said that after the wear and tear of decades of commuting and working, he had committed to doing his second Ironman triathlon in November 2016. For him, there are certainly financial costs. It cost $700 to enter the Ironman in Tempe, Ariz., and travel costs will be much more. He plans to do two half-Ironman triathlons for training. And then there is the gear needed to train and compete in events that encompass swimming, biking and running. He estimated that cost at more than $1,000. But those expenses are not Mr. O'Connor's primary concern. What motivates him are the larger costs, in economic terms, of what he will miss this year. He got his work colleagues and his family to sign off on his participation since they will see him less. He also enlisted a friend to train with him and committed to raising money for charity so he will not be doing the Ironman solely for himself. ""The Ironman is a very selfish race,"" he said. ""It's a huge amount of personal commitment. The more people who are part of it, the less selfish it seems."" Keeping in mind what he is sacrificing to accomplish his resolution will, he said, keep him on track.

As for the quicker way to self-improvement, January and February are usually big months for many types of plastic surgery, said Robert Grant, a plastic surgeon in New York. The financial costs -- rarely, if ever, covered by insurance -- range widely. Injectable treatments like Botox are generally under $1,000 but they need to be repeated periodically. Face-lifts usually cost $10,000 to $20,000. Then, there are the costs of time to recover, from weeks to several months. Yet Dr. Grant said he sometimes counsels patients that their expectations won't be met. Postholiday liposuction is one such procedure. ""If they've gained 10 to 15 pounds over the holiday and think I can suck it out, it doesn't work that way,"" he said. ""They're better off taking the 10 grand they'd pay me to hire a trainer or use one of those services that deliver three good meals a day."" BEING BETTER The resolutions to make ourselves better at what we're passionate about take discipline, too. Richard Kirshenbaum, the chief executive of the advertising agency NSG/SWAT, said he wanted to make himself more productive this year. ""This past year was really difficult for me,"" he said. ""I ended up having a lot more happen this year and I was not prepared as well as I could have been."" So he and his longtime assistant came up with the idea of blocking off two hours at some point every week for him to come up with the fresh ideas that every advertising agency needs. But they took it a step further: Mr. Kirshenbaum, 54, would have his driver take him to a restaurant and keep his cellphone in the car; only his assistant would know where he was, and she would have the sole authority to decide whether to have the driver interrupt him.

""After all these years in the business, I am very efficient with my time,"" he said. ""If I can have two hours, I can get a lot done."" Time is an issue, too, for Leslie Kirby, a technology consultant to financial services firms and the co-founder of Wall Street Rocks, a small nonprofit group that aims to help veterans. She said she had long wanted to visit some of the people the organization had helped and also to meet the leaders of new organizations it wanted to fund. So after years of pushing off these trips because she was busy with work, she picked a couple of weeks in February and booked a trip that will take her to Texas, Virginia and Minnesota. ""I want to understand some of these folks and the trouble they're having,"" she said. ""I want to go out and see what we do."" In both cases, Mr. Kirshenbaum and Ms. Kirby realized that failing to commit the time to their goals would mean they were not as effective as they could be. To keep them from making up excuses, they made the commitment in their calendars. FINANCIAL CHANGES As to financial resolutions, Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund company, released what it called its seventh annual ""financial resolutions study."" It found that money resolutions had increased. The survey found that 37 percent of respondents intended to make a financial resolution this year, up from 31 percent last year. One reason for the increase, the report said, was a feeling of economic uncertainty. While saving more topped the list -- with more than half of respondents resolving to do so -- the percentage of people who said they were going to pay off credit card debt was at its highest point since the company started the survey in 2009.","The best chance of succeeding at your goal is when you have an incentive — like a financial, social or health cost — not to fail, experts say.",8b58b4d6-7fb9-52c6-8c2d-953ea2eeed8a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/02/business/02wealth-web/02wealth-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=a335f21627893678195543071bb672b22c9848a8480073b3cbd358c0e88c53d9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"James O'Connor of Far Hills, N.J., who works in asset management, said after the wear and tear of decades of commuting and working, he has committed to doing his second Ironman Triathlon in November.",8b58b4d6-7fb9-52c6-8c2d-953ea2eeed8a,N24News/imgs/8b58b4d6-7fb9-52c6-8c2d-953ea2eeed8a.jpg,21

When these seemingly separate issues snowballed into a panic attack and a trip to the emergency room in late May, Ms. Whaley, 31, who lives in Brooklyn, connected the dots. ""I'm writing about the suffering of someone who looks like me,"" she said. ""We just keep going and going and going and going because we feel like that's what we must do, and that's not healthy."" The news today is filled with grief, especially for Black journalists reporting on violence against Black people, socioeconomic disparities underscored by the coronavirus pandemic and racism in the workplace. The situation is complicated by the fact that often they are doing this work for publications where most of the staff is white. ""Black journalists, like nurses or psychotherapists or anyone else who regularly hears or views trauma narratives, may experience vicarious trauma, or distress that stems from repeated exposure to the trauma of others,"" said Robin D. Stone, a licensed mental health counselor specializing in trauma-informed treatment. ""They may feel especially vulnerable that the person on the respirator or in the violent video could be them or someone they love."" (Ms. Stone knows the world of reporting intimately: For more than 20 years, she was a journalist, including a stint at The New York Times.)

The conditions can be particularly challenging for freelancers, who cannot rely on a biweekly paycheck or corporate health insurance, Ms. Whaley said. ""Even though you're getting paid, it really puts us in a vulnerable position while the company profits off the work that requires immense emotional and mental labor,"" she said. ""Yes, the stories need to be told. But no one is really thinking about whether Black freelancers have the resources they need to stay sane during this time."" Black Americans are underrepresented in American newsrooms; a Pew Research Center survey of data from 2013 to 2017 found that only 7 percent of newsroom employees are Black. (At The New York Times, 9 percent of newsroom employees are Black.) Often Black journalists are called upon to report and write specifically about issues within their own community, which may involve viewing imagery that depicts violence, hatred and death. Many of them have begun speaking out about the importance of prioritizing mental health care and wellness. In the absence of employer-sponsored insurance and mental health services for freelancers, and in light of recent discussions on workplace burnout, many Black journalists are rethinking the work that is required to report on atrocities in Black communities.

""I feel like we're still figuring it out,"" Ms. Whaley said. ""We're just starting to have these open conversations about mental health because in the past Black journalists were just supposed to be happy just to be in this space, especially if you have a job at a major publication. It's like everyone thinks that you've made it."" Inundated with a nonstop stream of race-related news, today's Black journalists are adopting a mix of traditional and informal practices to better care for and protect their own mental health and wellness. ""All Black Americans have some degree of PTSD,"" said Dr. Monnica Williams, a clinical psychologist and expert in race-based stress and trauma. In the case of Black journalists, Dr. Williams referred to studies of being ""repeatedly exposed to details of traumatic experiences in your line of work."" ""Being a journalist is not any different because you're being constantly exposed to these gruesome details of horrific instances of racism,"" she said. ""So it's just the same."" To better manage on a day-to-day basis, Dr. Williams recommended a ""toolbox of coping strategies"" that includes seeking social support within one's communities, briefly limiting one's exposure to cues of racism, engaging with religious or spiritual practices, seeking distraction from cues of racism, and participating in restful and relaxing activities. And how does one determine if and when they should take a break? Dr. Williams pointed to several examples of racial stress and trauma interfering with one's daily functions, like being depressed or anxious for most of the day, or having trouble sleeping.

But sometimes taking a break from writing means cutting off one's main source of income, especially without the support of paid sick days or paid time off. Ms. Whaley proposed offering Black journalists fully-funded sabbaticals every to rest, recover and reset: ""That would be a real reparation to me because we need it."" ""I want all Black journalists to know you deserve so much better,"" she continued. ""And I deserved better than what I gave myself and what this industry has given me."" Julia Craven, 27, a reporter for Slate in Washington, D.C., has been reporting exclusively on racism since graduating from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 2014. Two years into her career, the news cycle flooded with reports of hate crimes and white supremacist ideologies, fueled in part by the 2016 presidential election. There were also numerous stories of Black individuals who had been killed in police custody. Ms. Craven felt she could barely tread water. In each killed person, she would catch a glimpse of her loved ones: her brother, her boyfriend, her best friend, her sister and sometimes even herself. ""Everything seemed like it was constantly happening, so I went back into therapy,"" Ms. Craven said. ""I knew that I needed to develop some sort of self care system because if my mental health ain't on point, then I can't do my job.""

More recently, at her therapist's suggestion, Ms. Craven has made a concerted effort to limit her exposure to the news on the weekends. The move has given her the space and time to focus on herself on days off and be more present when she is at work, particularly at a demanding time. Dr. Williams said she frequently advises her Black clients, friends and even acquaintances to unplug from social media to recover from stress and recommends they not watch videos of Black people being harmed. ""I don't think journalists need to see these videos unless your job is to write a detailed account of how the person died, second by second,"" she said. But therapy and an escape from the news is a luxury to many, especially uninsured and freelance journalists, like Ms. Whaley. She said she tried seeing a therapist, but her funds were limited given her uneven employment and the cost of an in-network therapist through her health insurance. ""I couldn't afford the therapy because I'm a freelancer and not a full-time staff writer with benefits,"" she said. ""But then I need to go to therapy to help cope with my freelance career.""

Sonia Weiser, 28, a white freelance writer based in Manhattan, started the relief fund through a GoFundMe page after witnessing an outpouring of calls for Black writers to cover racial violence, as well as the protests galvanized by the killing of George Floyd, often for relatively little compensation. ""It just felt rude and disrespectful to put the onus on Black journalists, especially when so much of the trauma incurred in the industry is because of white employers,"" she said. After she created the fund, people donated to meet the $20,000 goal and raised $32,000 within 48 hours. Ms. Weiser has since raised over $70,000, and has partnered with the International Women's Media Foundation for additional support. They have provided microgrants to 84 applicants (the majority of whom don't have health insurance that covers mental health expenses), matching nearly every person's desired amount up to $2,000. As one of the fund recipients, Ms. Whaley has received enough money to see a therapist -- a Black woman, which was Ms. Whaley's preference -- twice a week for the next four to six months. (She sought more affordable psychotherapy sessions through Open Path Collective, a nonprofit organization providing affordable, in-office and online psychotherapy services ranging from $30 to $80 per session.) ""I was able to take a deep breath after that,"" Ms. Whaley said. While Ms. Stone recommends a therapist if trauma or stress-related symptoms are interfering with a person's work or home life, she said she also encourages Black journalists to cultivate a world outside of work and to seek support through communities of peers with whom they can share their experiences and find common ground and validation. Clydeen McDonald, 33, a freelance journalist from Trinidad and Tobago, said he had been despondent over his work, especially after two high-profile, historically white-staffed national publications passed on his pitches about coronavirus-related news in the Caribbean region.

Charlie Brinkhurst-Cuff, 27, the head of editorial at gal-dem magazine, a British publication that centers perspectives of women and nonbinary people of color, said for a while, she chose to prioritize her work ""ahead of personal concerns."" She noticed her stress levels were at an all-time high, underscored by a monthlong eye twitch. She felt anguish about her decision, recently, to take a week off. ""We've been doing this work, this anti-racist kind of reporting, for years now,"" she said. ""I've never seen this level of interest in what we do and how we do it. It's been intense. It's been very draining. This period of time and this increased level of interest won't last, and I kind of want to make the most out of it while people care.""","In a news cycle filled with tragedy, much of it disproportionately affecting people of color, Black reporters and editors are reimagining coping strategies.",9419c370-0584-52ad-8750-a43d0b644309,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/09/fashion/09BLACK-JOURNALISTS-Natelege-Whaley/09BLACK-JOURNALISTS-Natelege-Whaley-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=22fa714342397f71fa61df20ca4c72ac2052d01c461186e484c98642bd0f50bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Natelegé Whaley, a freelance journalist, said: ""No one is really thinking about whether Black freelancers have the resources they need to stay sane during this time.""",9419c370-0584-52ad-8750-a43d0b644309,N24News/imgs/9419c370-0584-52ad-8750-a43d0b644309.jpg,15
Global Business,Moody's Slashes Ireland's Credit Rating,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/18/business/global/18summit.html,"BRUSSELS  Even as Europe's leaders were praising the Irish government's deficit-cutting efforts, the country received a much different verdict on Friday from a credit rating agency: a steep downgrade and a warning of more to come. Having pledged late Thursday to do ""whatever is required"" to contain the debt crisis and defend their embattled currency, European Union leaders reconvened for the final day of a summit meeting. In the draft of a closing statement, the leaders welcomed the ""impressive progress"" in Dublin toward meeting the stiff conditions set for its recent bailout, including adoption of steep budget cuts. Moody's Investors Service had a different assessment, however. It cut Ireland's credit rating five notches, to Baa1 from Aa2, with a negative outlook, and said further downgrades could follow. The downgrade was a further blow for a country that has enacted deep austerity cuts, and it is likely to raise questions about whether the ratings agencies are hurting the efforts of struggling euro countries to emerge from the crisis.

""In a way, the ratings agencies are just playing catch-up with investor perceptions,"" said Robin Marshall, director of investment at Smith & Williamson in London. ""But it doesn't help the downward spiral of debt."" A number of institutional investors like pension funds are forced by internal rules to shift out of bonds when they are downgraded to a certain level. The biggest exodus would come if Ireland's debt ratings fell below investment grade. Moody's rating for Ireland remains investment grade, but if it dropped three more notches, it would be classified as junk, like that of Greece.

Another agency, Fitch, made a similar downgrade last week. Standard & Poor's still has Ireland rated as A, the top band, but on review for a possible downgrade. Just before its downgrade of Ireland, Moody's said it had put Greece's Ba1 rating on review for a possible downgrade, citing uncertainty over the country's ability to cut debt to sustainable levels. Market reaction was mixed to the moves. The euro slipped to $1.3178 on Friday from $1.3215 late Thursday. European stock indexes were lower and the benchmark bond yields for the most vulnerable countries in the zone edged up. The yield on the 10-year Irish bond surged 18 basis points, to 8.3 percent. European leaders hoped to help calm markets by agreeing late Thursday to create a permanent support fund for the euro after 2013. ""We are ready to do everything that is necessary to ensure the financial stability of the euro area,"" Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said at a news briefing. The draft declaration said that European leaders would ensure ""the availability of adequate financial support"" through their existing bailout fund of 440 billion euros ($582 billion), a hint that they may be prepared to increase it if necessary. With a bailout of Ireland recently completed, and concern that contagion will spread to Portugal and perhaps Spain, leaders have been divided on whether to increase the size of the fund or to allow money from it to be used to buy government debt.

Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, said the leaders had not discussed increasing the value of the fund or making it more flexible but had agreed more generally that they would ""do whatever is required to ensure the stability of the euro."" Leaders did agree to create a bailout mechanism that would operate after 2013, when the mandate of the current fund expired. Yet even here, vital questions on the size and scope of the fund were left until the spring. For the first time, bondholders could be asked to shoulder some losses in future debt crises on a case-by-case basis, a measure that the euro zone countries supported when they met several weeks ago to approve the bailout of Ireland and seek ways to support troubled economies in the future. To set up this facility, the European Union will have to revise its governing treaty, but it plans to do so in a way that would avoid requiring referendums in any of the 27 member countries, all of which would have to ratify the revision. At the meeting on Thursday, Germany and Britain agreed to compromises on the future rescue fund. The German government modified its efforts to win a clear declaration that the fund would be used only as a last resort.","European leaders said Ireland had done a good job cutting its deficit, but the country's credit rating was cut five notches, with a negative outlook.",6d857620-062f-5c57-b265-1ea394a31a27,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/12/18/business/SubSummit/SubSummit-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=78b4dcb1579bf0c9ef4a892456022a0f6f836c91867b2124780049fa7d9ca241&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, prepares Friday for the European Union meeting in Brussels.",6d857620-062f-5c57-b265-1ea394a31a27,N24News/imgs/6d857620-062f-5c57-b265-1ea394a31a27.jpg,24
Opinion,Why a Biden Victory Hinges on Picking the Right Running Mate,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/26/opinion/joe-biden-running-mate.html,"Do vice-presidential picks matter? Conventional wisdom argues they have limited electoral impact. But a vice-presidential pick does matter in a particular way to elections. It suggests the strategy and tactics a campaign will pursue. The pick might complement the ticket, like Al Gore did for Bill Clinton in 1992, or the pick might balance the ticket, like Mike Pence did for Donald Trump. So Joe Biden's electoral fate may well hinge on this decision. In our polarized era, where turnout determines election victors and each party's coalition has become more locked in, ticket-balancing picks for vice president can be helpful in mending primary wounds and generating excitement for the coalition in the general election. That is why Mr. Biden should select for his running mate a ticket balancer. Now, the temptation for Mr. Biden to pick a ticket ""complementer"" will be high. All the conventional wisdom suggests that ticket complementers ""do no harm"" because they are, essentially, prototypes of the presidential nominee. By contrast, ticket balancers offer voters something the main nominee lacks and often are meant to motivate a group within the coalition with which the nominee has struggled to gain traction. Balancers are perceived to be riskier, especially since John McCain's selection of Sarah Palin in 2008.

Hillary Clinton is often castigated as running a terrible, horrible, no good, doomed campaign. She actually ran a perfectly fine campaign -- but strategically speaking, it was the wrong kind of campaign. It was based on the flawed assumption that a significant portion of American conservatives would not, simply could not, vote for Donald Trump.
* Mark Penn and Andrew Stein write that ""only a broader course correction to the center will give Democrats a fighting chance in 2022"" and beyond.
* Tory Gavito and Adam Jentleson write that the Virgina loss should ""shock Democrats into confronting the powerful role that racially coded attacks play in American politics.""
* Ezra Klein speaks to David Shor, who discusses his fear that Democrats face electoral catastrophe unless they shift their messaging.
* Ross Douthat writes that the outcome of the Virginia gubernatorial race shows Democrats need a ""new way to talk about progressive ideology and education."" But on Election Day, 90 percent of Republicans voted for him; Mrs. Clinton also failed to carry independents, despite a campaign structured mostly on winning them over.

Mrs. Clinton's ""do no harm"" pick -- Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia -- ended up doing her considerable harm. The strategy built around the pick ended up leaving the party's progressive flank vulnerable to, among other things, a sophisticated Russian propaganda and disinformation campaign. In addition, so-called protest balloting in 2016 was three to five times higher than normal in the swing states. In states like Wisconsin, which was decided by less than a percentage point, nearly 6 percent of the electorate cast protest ballots. For all the attention placed on white, working-class voters and their continued realignment away from Democrats, protest balloting affected the outcome of every swing state contest and played a pivotal role in Mr. Trump's destruction of the Democrat's Midwest ""blue wall.""

Yet Mr. Trump still has a plurality problem, and his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, knows it. Even before the pandemic came along to destroy his best argument for re-election, the economy, Mr. Trump was unpopular among independents and has hardly ever (aside from a brief moment early in the coronavirus crisis) hit 50 percent approval rating nationally and rarely in swing states. The only way to re-elect a plurality president is to make a plurality vote share sufficient enough to win. And the best way to do that is to replicate Russia's playbook of targeting parts of the Democratic coalition -- like progressives and young black voters -- to turn them against voting for Mr. Biden. The only person who has as much riding on Mr. Biden's decision is Mr. Trump. As in 2016, he hopes to pick off or discourage disgruntled progressive voters. Much of Mr. Trump's re-election hopes are pinned on Mr. Biden making the wrong choice of running mate. So the Biden team must make a pick that can help Democrats match what promises to be an energized Republican base. The best way to do that is a ticket-balancing candidate like Stacey Abrams or Kamala Harris. They would bring gender and racial diversity to the ticket and, perhaps even more important, ideological diversity. That might prove to be the single most effective way to head off the Trump campaign's ""divide and conquer"" plan for progressives in 2020. With 120 million millennials and Generation Z potential voters now powering their coalition, Democrats would be wise to recognize that their electoral fate hinges on getting these voters to the polls. Mr. Biden is positioning himself as a bridge to the party's future -- and liberals like Ms. Harris and Ms. Abrams would help pave the way. Another ticket-balancing approach would be to put a down payment on the Democratic Party's geographic future. This approach would focus resources not as much on the Midwest but on Sunbelt states from California to Georgia through Texas, which could rise as a potential swing state as early as 2024. This would have the Biden team looking at Michelle Lujan Grisham, the Latina governor of New Mexico, or at Senator Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada as potential running mates. Mr. Biden's nomination maxes out the ticket's appeal to the center of the electorate. Among independents, the pandemic, economic collapse and Mr. Trump's antics already provide Mr. Biden a hard edge. A centrist, ticket-complementing pick like Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota will likely bring diminishing returns in this regard. As a fellow white moderate, Ms. Klobuchar is a quintessential ticket complementor -- a 2020 version of Mr. Kaine.

If Mr. Biden is going to ignore the fact that today's Democratic Party represents the most racially diverse coalition in America's history, he should at least look to a ticket balancer like Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, who would bring ideological diversity and guarantee robust turnout and loyal support among progressives, many of whom are independents. The special election last week in California's 25th District shows Democrats are still vulnerable to low turnout; when their coalition fails to turn out, they lose. It also dispelled a dangerous myth -- suburban Republicans are not casting ballots for Democrats. If Democrats want to hold on to or even expand on their House gains from 2018 and potentially take control of the Senate, they need an excited electorate. Election outcomes in key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Florida and Arizona all come down to the same thing: the percentage of Democrats and left-leaning independents that end up casting ballots compared with the percentage of Republicans and right-leaning independents that do so. Republicans understand this campaign math and learned to solve this equation a long time ago. The only question is, have Democrats finally solved it too?

Sports,Jon Rahm Sinks a Big Putt to Win Playoff at the BMW Championship,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/sports/golf/jon-rahm-bmw-championship.html,"OLYMPIA FIELDS, Ill. -- Even with so few people around, Jon Rahm could hear from the other side of the Olympia Fields clubhouse that Dustin Johnson had made a 45-foot birdie on the final hole to force a playoff on Sunday in the BMW Championship.

Resilient as ever, Rahm went out and made some magic of his own.

Real Estate,How Will Hudson Yards Survive the Pandemic?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/19/realestate/how-will-hudson-yards-survive-the-pandemic.html,"The Edge -- the highest sky deck in the Western Hemisphere and the latest crown jewel in Manhattan's sprawling Hudson Yards project -- opened to the public on March 11. The observation deck, which cantilevers about 80 feet out from the 100th floor of 30 Hudson Yards, offers helicopter views, as well as a knee-wobbling gaze through a triangular glass floor down to the streets of the Far West Side. It was an experience that lasted for only two days, as the coronavirus shut down the deck and all other venues where New Yorkers and tourists might gather.

Hudson Yards' success -- or failure -- in adapting to a post-COVID world will be a bellwether for New York's real estate industry, but even beyond that, for the city's overall economic health, as it embodies prime engines that help keep New York City running: high-end retail, luxury housing and Class A office space. ""Around the country, people look at Hudson Yards as a huge success and say, 'Look at what they managed to do in terms of the sheer scale of it,' "" said Eliot L. Spitzer, the former New York governor, who is now a real estate developer and working on a project in Hudson Yards. ""People will debate the aesthetics, but there is always a wow factor."" Now, though, Mr. Spitzer said, ""nobody knows what will happen. We don't know how it's going to end up. As an optimist, I never bet against New York City. We've been through this before -- recessions, 9/11. But anybody would necessarily have some doubts -- does the pandemic change the emotional desire of people to be in the city? Will we begin to see anchor tenants or employers move away?"" Preliminary citywide data capture the hollowing impact of the pandemic. In March, New York City collected $118 million in real estate property transfer taxes, according to the New York City Independent Budget Office. That figure plummeted to $43 million in April, and then to $35.5 million in May.

Still, most of the two dozen people interviewed for this article, ranging from real estate professionals to city officials and academics, said that even if Neiman Marcus and other retailers go under, and condo sales for the unbuilt towers over the unbuilt platform stagnate, Hudson Yards is essentially too big to fail. Owned and managed by the Related Companies, one of the biggest private real estate developers in the world, Hudson Yards is also working with one of its marquee tenants, the Mount Sinai health system, to adopt safety and cleaning guidelines protecting employees, residents and visitors. ""Hudson Yards has inherent advantages because it was conceived as an integrated, sustainable, state-of-the-art live-work-play environment where people can get everything they want and need right in their own neighborhood,"" Stephen M. Ross, chairman of the Related Companies, said in a statement. ""The benefits of this kind of future forward thinking are more apparent and relevant than ever right now."" Originally spurred by the city's bid for the 2012 Olympics, the project promised to transform a derelict industrial zone and offer an exclamation point to the High Line, said James Whelan, president of the Real Estate Board of New York, and a former executive director of the Hudson Yards Coalition, a business group which pushed for West Side redevelopment.

Sweetened by generous tax breaks, the project sold a packaged, stratospheric lifestyle to international tourists, millennial workers and part-time residents in a new frontier accessed by the extension of No. 7 subway line. ""Hudson Yards is in some ways disconnected from the city -- it's a city within a city, and it's operating at a global scale,"" said Kael Goodman, president and chief executive of Marketproof, a real estate data analysis firm. ""It's more like what might be happening in Hong Kong and other Tier 1 cities."" The project's first phase, running from 10th to 11th Avenues between 30th and 34th Streets, features four office towers, two condominiums, one mall, the Vessel and the Shed arts center. It officially opened to the public in March 2019, exactly a year before coronavirus hit the city. The second phase, which will run from 11th to 12th Avenues, will be dominated by residential towers. Hudson Yards's footprint of 28 square acres, half of which will be open space, is projected to accommodate 125,000 people who will live, work, study, shop and visit the area daily. There will be 18 million square feet of commercial and residential space, and 4,000 new apartments, more than 10 percent of which will be subsidized housing. Or that was the plan before the pause button of the coronavirus. ""The best thing to say about Hudson Yards is the jury is still out,"" said Pierre E. Debbas, managing partner of Romer Debbas, a real estate law firm. While Neiman Marcus's bankruptcy has attracted inordinate attention, other retailers are struggling, too, with roughly 40 percent paying rent in April and May. Some retailers may have flexibility in their leases to renegotiate their rents if Neiman is no longer able to operate. Still, Harrison Abramowitz, a managing director at Newmark Knight Frank, a commercial real estate firm, said that if Neiman Marcus were to depart, other businesses would likely take over the space, whether as a whole, or in pieces, or even as office space.

When Hudson Yards was built, the assumption was that the red-hot luxury condominium market would power the project. Against that backdrop, Equinox, the luxury fitness brand, branched into the hotel business as the anchor of 35 Hudson Yards. ""You could probably draw a 20 block radius and you wouldn't find many luxury hotels,"" said Daniel Peek, president of the hotel group at Hodges Ward Elliott, a brokerage firm. But the luxury condominium market was already softening before the pandemic, Mr. Peek noted. And though Related recently notched a milestone by selling more than 15 percent of its condominium units at 35 Hudson Yards, paving the way to begin closing sales, many prospective buyers are waiting until they can visit the area before signing contracts. Only 25 contracts valued at over $4 million were signed in the nine-week period prior to May 24, versus 207 over the same period last year, said Michael J. Franco, a real estate broker for Compass, who represented a buyer of a Hudson Yards penthouse. And citing ""extremely challenging conditions"" in the condominium market, Related recently stopped contributing optional payments to the federal EB-5 program, which has granted permanent residency to foreign investors who have helped bankroll luxury real estate projects.

""I still believe in Hudson Yards as a neighborhood, as a development, but we're at a standstill all over New York City with real estate,"" Mr. Franco said. By contrast, Related says 93 percent of the commercial space that has been built, or is under construction, has been leased. All commercial tenants paid rent in April, and nearly all in May. So-called healthy buildings which stress wellness, nontoxic materials and state-of-the-art filtration and other systems -- such as the ones at Hudson Yards -- are likely to become more attractive in a post-COVID world, according to a new report from DBRS Morningstar. But even as New York gradually reopens, many companies plan to restrict visitors and adhere to social-distancing guidelines, according to a recent report from CBRE, a commercial real estate firm. Companies are reconsidering office space in Manhattan, while commercial rents are collapsing. Facebook, which has pledged to lease 1.5 million square feet at 55 Hudson Yards, will allow many employees to work from home permanently. Still, KKR and Company, the private equity firm, recently agreed to take over 22,000 square feet at 10 Hudson Yards to supplement an anticipated 343,000 square feet in its future corporate headquarters at 30 Hudson Yards. ""Our commitment to move to the west side is unchanged,"" Henry Kravis, the firm's co-founder and co-chief executive, said in a statement. ""Adding even more turnkey square footage right next to our future home was both a practical step and a unique opportunity."" But if Hudson Yards struggles, the ripple effects could be significant. For the last five years, New York City has not had to make interest support payments on the bonds that financed Hudson Yards, and Hudson Yards is expected to send $350 million into the city's coffers by the end of the fiscal year in June.

But property tax delinquencies could become an issue. And with Hudson Yards set to start paying principal on those bonds in 2021, ""you have to worry again,"" said Elizabeth Brown, senior tax expenditure policy analyst at the city's Independent Budget Office. Even retired teachers in Ohio have an interest, since their pension fund owns a 20 percent share of 10 Hudson Yards. ""The world has topsy-turvied, so we would expect the trustees on the board to be mindful of the overall performance of real estate in the portfolio,"" said Mark Hill, secretary-treasurer of the Ohio Education Association, and a former trustee of the State Teachers Retirement System of Ohio. James F. Wenk, vice chairman of Jones Lang LaSalle, a commercial real estate company, predicted that New York City real estate would be in a ""temporary pause period"" until the fourth quarter of the year. ""At the end of the day we're all human beings, and we like to be in a physical space, sharing ideas, sharing emotions,"" he said. ""As it relates to the success of the Yards, this is still a game about attracting the best talent. The best talent wants to be in the most technologically advanced buildings, and Hudson Yards in general has those technological advantages.""

Music,Tory Lanez Charged With Assault in Shooting of Megan Thee Stallion,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/08/arts/music/stallion-lanez-shooting.html,"Months after the chart-topping rapper Megan Thee Stallion said she had been shot in the feet by a fellow musician in the Hollywood Hills, the rapper Tory Lanez has been charged in the episode, the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office announced on Thursday.

Mr. Lanez, a Canadian artist whose real name is Daystar Peterson, faces one count of assault with a semiautomatic handgun and one count of carrying a loaded, unregistered firearm in a vehicle. He would face up to 22 years and eight months in prison if convicted, the district attorney said. Mr. Lanez, 28, was initially arrested on July 12 and charged with concealing a firearm in the vehicle, the police said at the time.

But in the days and weeks that followed, the matter became the subject of intense speculation, gossip and finger-pointing after Megan Thee Stallion, 25, born Megan Pete, said via Instagram on July 15 that she had ""suffered gunshot wounds, as a result of a crime that was committed against me and done with the intention to physically harm me.""

Technology,Twitter Stands by Trump Amid Calls to Terminate His Account,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/15/technology/trump-twitter-account.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Twitter said on Tuesday that it would continue to be lenient with world leaders who appeared to violate its policies against violent speech because the company believed preserving those tweets served the public interest. The announcement came as Twitter grapples with scrutiny for hosting President Trump's increasingly virulent messages about the impeachment proceedings against him. Under pressure from Democrats to take action against Mr. Trump's account, Twitter said that it would take action against a world leader's account only if it was used to threaten an individual, promote terrorism or self-harm, or post private information like a phone number. ""The accounts of world leaders are not above our policies entirely,"" the company said in a blog post. ""Presently, direct interactions with fellow public figures, comments on political issues of the day, or foreign policy saber-rattling on economic or military issues are generally not in violation of the Twitter Rules.""

The social media service has been under growing pressure since a whistle-blower complaint emerged in September that Mr. Trump sought to enlist a foreign power to tarnish a rival for his own political gain. Since then, the House has initiated a formal impeachment inquiry against the president, prompting Mr. Trump to tweet a string of messages that some have called threatening and bullying. In one instance, the president said on Twitter that the unnamed whistle-blower might be a spy. He also quoted a Fox News guest who said impeachment could lead to chaos akin to a civil war and referred to the impeachment proceedings as a ""coup"" intended to strip Americans of their rights. He also called for the arrest of Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is closely involved in the impeachment process, for treason.

The tweets have raised questions for Twitter. Jake Tapper, a CNN news anchor, said the tweets needed to come with a parental advisory. And Senator Kamala Harris of California, who is running to be the Democratic presidential nominee, called on Twitter this month to suspend Mr. Trump's account. In a letter to Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, Ms. Harris said the president's tweets were ""blatant threats"" that clearly violated Twitter's policies.

Twitter responded to Ms. Harris on Tuesday with a letter summarizing its blog post, a spokeswoman said. A spokesman for Ms. Harris's campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Mr. Trump's posts have regularly caused issues for Twitter. The president has long used the service as a megaphone to speak directly to the public, sometimes using threatening language, including when he insinuated last year that he might start a nuclear war against North Korea. The San Francisco company has faced questions about why it allows Mr. Trump to keep a Twitter account at all because it does not allow bullying on its site. In 2017, a rogue Twitter worker deleted Mr. Trump's account, which was restored in about 10 minutes. In June, Twitter said it planned to roll out a feature to hide abusive tweets from world leaders behind warning labels, rather than scrubbing them from the platform because the messages are newsworthy. That would strike a balance between making information available to the public and enforcing its policies against violence and abuse, the company said. The feature has yet to be used against any world leader's account, including Mr. Trump's. ""There are certain cases where it may be in the public's interest to have access to certain tweets, even if they would otherwise be in violation of our rules,"" Twitter said at the time. Mr. Trump has argued that Twitter and other social media services are biased against conservative figures like himself and are preventing their posts from reaching broad audiences. The Trump administration has threatened to take action against social media companies for censorship, and any action Twitter takes against Mr. Trump's account is likely to be met with a backlash.","Twitter said it would keep President Trump's account live, despite pressure from Democrats to delete it.",97a77374-a395-5baa-b562-20652b8b15e2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/02/business/15twitter/00twitter-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=409160cca36b0d8f134ac6c8a0df6d710b6b998c517255bf878c784188361f80&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Twitter said on Tuesday that it would continue to be lenient with the accounts of world leaders.,97a77374-a395-5baa-b562-20652b8b15e2,N24News/imgs/97a77374-a395-5baa-b562-20652b8b15e2.jpg,20
Technology,"Pentagon, With an Eye on China, Pushes for Help From American Tech",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/25/technology/pentagon-taiwan-tsmc-chipmaker.html,"Pentagon, With an Eye on China, Pushes for Help From American Tech

SAN FRANCISCO -- Pentagon officials have been holding private discussions with tech industry executives to wrestle with a key question: how to ensure future supplies of the advanced computer chips needed to retain America's military edge. The talks, some of which predate the Trump administration, recently took on an increased urgency, according to people who were involved or briefed on the discussions. Pentagon officials encouraged chip executives to consider new production lines for semiconductors in the United States, said the people, who declined to be identified because the talks were confidential. The discussions are being driven by the Pentagon's increased dependence on chips made abroad, especially in Taiwan, as well as recent tensions with China, these people said. One chip maker, the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, better known as TSMC , plays a particularly crucial role producing commercial chips that also have applications for aircraft, satellites, drones and wireless communications. And because of unrest over the past few months in the semiautonomous Chinese territory of Hong Kong, some Pentagon officials and chip executives have wondered about situations that could force suppliers in Taiwan to limit or cut off silicon shipments, the people said.

Mark Liu, the chairman of TSMC, said he had recently discussed options for a new factory in the United States with the Commerce Department. The stumbling block was money; major subsidies would be required, he said, as it is more expensive to operate in America than Taiwan. ""It is all up to when we can close the cost gap,"" he said in an interview. The conversations are a sign of how federal agencies are grappling with a deep-rooted technology conundrum. The United States has long fielded the most advanced weaponry by exploiting electronic components once exclusively produced in the country. Chips help tanks, aircraft, rockets and ships navigate, communicate with one another and engage enemy targets. But domestic production lines of many chips have long since moved overseas, raising questions about supply interruptions in the event of political or military crises abroad. Those fears have been exacerbated by the increasing importance of particular components -- such as programmable chips that figure prominently in the F-35 fighter jet, which are designed by the Silicon Valley company Xilinx and mainly fabricated in Taiwan. Some chips, such as the wireless baseband processors needed for new 5G communications abilities that Pentagon officials covet, require advanced manufacturing technology that has become a key selling point of TSMC. ""We in the Defense Department cannot afford to be shut out of all of those capabilities,"" said Lisa Porter, deputy under secretary for research and engineering, in remarks at an event in July that were later widely circulated among chip makers.

In another sign of action, Skywater Technology, a Minnesota chip manufacturing service, said this week that the Defense Department would invest up to $170 million to increase its production and enhance technologies, such as the ability to produce chips that can withstand radiation in space. The Skywater investment illustrates how the Pentagon is also wrestling with how to upgrade aging technology at domestic companies that make small volumes of classified chips tailored for the military. Such ""trusted"" factories, as they are called, operate under Pentagon rules aimed at preventing sabotage or data theft. Dr. Porter and other Pentagon officials have pushed for new technical safeguards besides guards and employee background checks to keep sensitive chip designs secure, a strategy that would help the Defense Department use more advanced commercial factories. She called the idea a ""zero-trust"" philosophy. TSMC, which dominates the build-to-order services called foundries, recently took the lead from Intel in shrinking chip circuitry to give chips greater capability. Its production edge is one reason the company has continued to win business from big American chip designers such as Apple, Qualcomm and Nvidia, whose chips have become increasingly important for defense as well as civilian applications. The United States remains the leading supplier and innovator in most chip technologies, including the processors that Intel sells for nearly all personal computers and server systems. But the Pentagon's research arm -- DARPA , for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency -- has been trying since 2017 to spur chip innovations under a $1.5 billion Electronics Resurgence Initiative.

Its goals include finding alternatives to silicon for manufacturing and packaging small ""chiplets"" together instead of making big monolithic chips. ""We have vulnerabilities we really need to address, but we are still the dominant producer of electronics in the world,"" said Mark Rosker, the director of DARPA's microsystems technology office. He said questions about the American semiconductor industry called for ""a graceful and considered kind of panic."" Much of the recent urgency stems from China's growing stature as a chip innovator. Designers there have developed chips for sensitive applications such as supercomputers. Many of the designers -- including Huawei, a key target of the Trump administration in the trade war -- also rely on TSMC for manufacturing. Another impetus for action stems from a recent pullback by GlobalFoundries. The chip maker, owned by investors in Abu Dhabi, has spent around $12 billion on a sophisticated factory in Malta, N.Y. But it announced last year that it would stop trying to create smaller circuitry than that on its existing production processes. GlobalFoundries now produces classified chips under the trusted foundry rules in two former IBM factories it took over in 2015. Company executives believe the technology in its Malta facility remains advanced enough to also serve military needs for years, and it is negotiating with officials to handle future classified work through proposed modifications to the government's trusted foundry regulations. It recently filed a lawsuit accusing TSMC of patent infringement, an action that it said was aimed partly at protecting the American manufacturing base. The company, which announced plans for a $10 billion factory in China in 2017, is also rethinking that project as the promised demand from customers there now seems uncertain, said Thomas Caufield, the chief executive of GlobalFoundries. Influencing the chip industry used to be easier when the Defense Department accounted for a major portion of chip sales. Now defense applications are dwarfed by civilian uses, such as smartphones and personal computers. More of the Pentagon's budget now goes to chips like memory and processors whose designs are shaped by commercial needs.",Talks over how U.S. companies can ensure future supplies of advanced computer chips have taken on more urgency.,bf9927ed-fa3a-58e4-b661-e639ae3fa1f3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/23/business/00pentagonchip/00pentagonchip-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5750ea2638833e47b03def61a4204d62e2035ec8f2d5736115a9aa6a578f940d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Pentagon increasingly depends on chips made abroad, especially by companies like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company.",bf9927ed-fa3a-58e4-b661-e639ae3fa1f3,N24News/imgs/bf9927ed-fa3a-58e4-b661-e639ae3fa1f3.jpg,20
Health,Considering the Side Effects of Drugmakers' Money-Back Guarantees,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/10/health/prescription-drugs-cost.html,"This article is a collaboration between The Times and ProPublica, the independent nonprofit investigative-journalism organization. More than a decade ago, Italy tried a novel approach to help bring down drug costs: asking pharmaceutical companies to return money to the national health system if some of their medicines failed to work as expected. The effort largely flopped. The Trump administration is now considering whether to encourage a similar approach. Pharmaceutical executives presented the idea to President Trump at a meeting in January, and the general concept was raised last month in a draft executive order aimed at combating rising drug prices. A number of drug companies have recently entered into such deals, which they call outcomes-based contracts. Merck has done so for its diabetes drugs Januvia and Janumet, promising to return money if patients' diabetes did not meet goals for control. And Novartis, which makes the heart failure treatment Entresto, is refunding money if too many patients taking the drug are hospitalized. In more typical deals, drugmakers pay rebates to insurers based on the number of drugs sold and to gain easier access for members to their products.

But there is scant evidence this new approach lowers costs. Pharmaceutical companies still set the drug's list price and have to agree to the criteria upon which they will be measured. Some experts say such arrangements are a ploy to deflect attention from substantive changes that could hurt companies' bottom lines, such as allowing Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Moreover, the savings don't always trickle down to consumers. ""Most of them get launched with great fanfare,"" said Dr. Steve Miller, the chief medical officer at Express Scripts, which manages the drug benefits of more than 80 million Americans. ""But then you never hear anything about it after the launch because most of them collapse under their own weight."" In a recent note to investors, David Maris, an analyst at Wells Fargo, described the approach as a ""carnival game"" and said he did not know of any such arrangements ""where a drug company did not consider it a win for them."" Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the industry trade group, said the approach was in keeping with a trend toward paying doctors and hospitals for the quality of care they deliver rather than the number of services they provide.

To understand how these deals work, consider the one that the drugmaker Amgen made with Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, a nonprofit insurer in Massachusetts and one of the insurers to most aggressively test the concept. It has entered into at least eight such deals over the past two years. This spring, Amgen agreed to pay a full refund to Harvard Pilgrim if patients who took its pricey new cholesterol drug, Repatha, suffered a heart attack or stroke. Repatha is intended for patients with very high cholesterol levels, for which cheaper drugs, known as statins, do not work. As part of such deals, insurers eased restrictions on which patients could gain access to the drug, said Dr. Joshua J. Ofman, a senior vice president at Amgen. Sales of Repatha and similar drugs have disappointed in part because insurers have been reluctant to pay for them given their price. If Harvard Pilgrim patients taking Repatha have a heart attack or stroke, they share in the refund, getting back all out-of-pocket payments that they have made toward the drug, said Dr. Michael Sherman, chief medical officer at Harvard Pilgrim. Doctors who prescribe Repatha said the deals do not affect how they treat patients. ""We're completely agnostic to it,"" said Dr. Frederic S. Resnic, chairman of cardiovascular medicine at the Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Mass., who sees patients with Harvard Pilgrim insurance. The drugs are so costly that doctors still only prescribe them when patients really need them, he said. Dr. Peter B. Bach, director of the Center for Health Policy and Outcomes at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, is skeptical. He said the pharmaceutical industry is conflating setting drug prices based on the value they bring to patients and the health care system, which he supports, with negotiating givebacks when patients don't respond to drugs, which he sees as too little, too late. The arrangements, he said, carried ""bells and whistles"" that made them look good in theory. ""But as long as you control all the contract terms, it can be a lot of optics but no substance,"" he said.

Dr. Bach and others say the pharmaceutical industry is using this approach to justify seeking major changes to federal regulations that could benefit them even more -- including rolling back a requirement that Medicaid programs for the poor get the lowest drug prices, and another that bars companies from giving kickbacks to health providers. The industry says the changes are needed to allow more flexibility in the type of deals they can offer. Drug companies and insurers touted these contracts when they were announced, but participants in several deals either declined to comment recently or provided little information about their programs.

At a conference last month in Virginia, a senior director with Prime Therapeutics, a pharmacy benefit manager, offered a blunt assessment of such contracts, saying they were not cost-effective. But in a phone interview, his boss, David Lassen, the chief clinical officer, was a bit more measured, saying that though the deals carry promise, the work to track patient outcomes is expensive and burdensome. ""In their current state, where they're falling short is where you look at the return on investment,"" Mr. Lassen said. Dr. Sherman at Harvard Pilgrim said the deals would not work for every drug and that drugmakers typically showed no interest when there were no competing brand-name drugs that worked in a similar way. Some pharmaceutical executives acknowledge the model should not be seen as a panacea. Leonard S. Schleifer, the chief executive of Regeneron, questioned how such pricing would work for a drug like Dupixent, an eczema drug his company makes that was approved this year. ""Are we going to start calculating the surface area of the rash that's improved?"" said Dr. Schleifer, whose company has entered into some outcomes-based deals for Praluent, a competitor to Repatha.","The Trump administration is considering encouraging lowering drug costs through outcome-based contracts, but there is little evidence the approach works.",6f304f03-3b81-501d-95af-598a9009858e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/08/science/11DRUGPRICING1/11DRUGPRICING1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=76d7bcdf09e60c996ed6d494ce7d073e0228b5301d0dee74bdc02a4f259a0356&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Tablets of Januvia, a diabetes medicine created by Merck.

Movies,"'Be Natural' Review: Rescuing Alice Guy Blaché, a Film Pioneer, From Oblivion",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/movies/be-natural-untold-story-alice-guy-blache-review.html,"At the beginning of Pamela B. Green's lively and informative new documentary, a bevy of movie people -- directors, actors, scholars and others -- are asked if they know anything about Alice Guy Blache, who is the subject of the film. A few of them do (Ava DuVernay, for one), but most admit that they have no clue. Viewers who are similarly ignorant shouldn't feel bad, and in the best pedagogical spirit Green turns blank looks and sheepishly shrugged shoulders into a teaching moment. ""Be Natural: The Untold Story of Alice Guy-Blache"" seeks both to help rescue Guy Blache from oblivion and to explain how she got there in the first place.

Alice Guy was born into a bourgeois French family in 1873. An interview conducted more than 90 years later reveals a woman very much of her era and class, with crisp diction, faultless grammar and a mildly ironical way of talking about even painful and contentious matters. Trained in stenography, Alice was hired, at 22, as an assistant to Leon Gaumont, who would soon become one of the founders of the French film industry.

Guy (who married the British cameraman Herbert Blache in 1907) merits that description as much as her boss. Often referred to as a pioneer -- one of a handful of important women filmmakers active in cinema's earliest days -- she was more than that. Present at an early, private Paris showing of one of Louis and Auguste Lumiere's first shorts, Guy was among the first to explore the storytelling potential of the new medium. At the Gaumont studio, where she worked until 1906, she directed hundreds of fantasies, comedies, melodramas and historical films. After moving to the United States, she set up her own company, Solax Studios, continuing her prolific output in the burgeoning proto-Hollywood of Fort Lee, N.J.","This lively documentary shows how a founder of two national cinemas — director, producer and studio boss — was almost forgotten.",5d88a2b0-9db5-537c-8324-8a12bcfa8c3e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/25/arts/25benatural2/25benatural2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f92a8dfa98c0d93498659d34a33a982817bdac439096a8b007787700fd9328db&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Alice Guy Blaché in 1912. <br /><br />,5d88a2b0-9db5-537c-8324-8a12bcfa8c3e,N24News/imgs/5d88a2b0-9db5-537c-8324-8a12bcfa8c3e.jpg,5
Dance,"Clifton Brown, an Alvin Ailey Favorite, Returns to the Fold",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/13/arts/dance/clifton-brown-an-alvin-ailey-favorite-returns-to-the-fold.html,"Onstage, Clifton Brown is a force: a dancer with enormous presence, a strong theatricality and a large-scale, lush physicality. His long, graceful arms seem to embrace the world, and he has a way of tilting his face upward so it catches the light, giving him the air of someone illuminated by thought. These qualities made him a favorite at Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, which he joined in 1999 at 19, and left in 2011. ""Ailey is kind of an island,"" he explained on a recent morning, ""and I'd never had the opportunity to see what the outside world was like."" He went on to dance for the modern-dance choreographer Lar Lubovitch, and then, more lastingly, for Jessica Lang, a contemporary dancemaker who was in the process of putting together an ensemble. He stayed with Ms. Lang for six years, becoming her rehearsal director. But now he is returning to the Ailey fold. I caught up with him at the company's studios; he had been back only two weeks and was preparing for the troupe's Lincoln Center run, which opens on Wednesday. He looked focused, and a little tired.

At Lincoln Center, he'll be easing back into old roles in Ailey's signature work, ""Revelations"": the arduous solo ""I Wanna Be Ready,"" the high-energy trio ""Sinner Man,"" and the prayerful duet ""Fix Me, Jesus."" Then, during the company's coming tour, he'll take on more repertory, including Christopher Wheeldon's pas de deux ""After the Rain."" In conversation, Mr. Brown is as soft-spoken and introspective as he is imposing on the stage. These are edited excerpts from our discussion. Is 'Revelations' still in your bones? I don't think I could forget it even if I wanted to. In a way, it's like riding a bike, but I have a new perspective on it as well. You realize a lot of things you thought were so important are really not so important. Like in ""I Wanna Be Ready,"" the way it looks, the picture, is important, but it's also a means to an end. Each time you rise up a little bit further, and each time there is a giving up or a defeat. You have to find out how to get there, to have an internal reason. I have a little more insight into the reasons behind it because I've had time to think about the architecture of it. How did the time away change you as a dancer? I feel that I have more understanding of the importance of the work from the side of the choreographers. Being a dancer in a rep company, you're always trying to do your best on each program, but it's hard to get the specific intention for each piece and each style. But I feel like I have a different kind of approach now.

What drew you to dance for Jessica Lang? Her movement style changes from piece to piece, which is good, especially for a choreographer whose work you're doing all the time. And her movement feels good; it's beautiful but it's simple. It has simplicity combined with richness. And from the outside, it's stunning to look at. How about Mr. Lubovitch -- what do you like about his style? His movement is so organic and so fluid; I actually feel like that's close to my natural movement quality in general. In working with Ailey, I learned to have more attack and more staccato. Why did you decide to return to Ailey now? When I left Ailey, I was hoping to experience other things, but not leave forever. So this just felt like the right time to do it. I wanted to see what it's like, with largely a different group of dancers and a new director [Robert Battle], now that the company is taking this slightly different direction. It's kind of a familiar, but also a new, experience. So, what's it like to dance 'Sinner Man' at 37? [Laughs.] It's a great quick-twitch muscle workout, like being shot out of a cannon. It takes anticipation. You have to be ready. It's about conjuring up the feeling of Judgment Day, so you've got to run. And then at the end, you're just really out of breath.",Mr. Brown talks about coming back to the dance company after years of performing with Lar Lubovitch and Jessica Lang.,5ee2ccfd-26f4-5d51-a485-695c82c9c579,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/14/arts/14CLIFTON/14CLIFTON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=79a30c1a7d040f3eee047e47f19e1743385653ce7c2de4d3f87c37c71063acf7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clifton Brown, rehearsing in New York.",5ee2ccfd-26f4-5d51-a485-695c82c9c579,N24News/imgs/5ee2ccfd-26f4-5d51-a485-695c82c9c579.jpg,6
Dance,"Review: 'Intensio' Suggests a Self-Portrait, With Help From Friends",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/07/arts/dance/review-intensio-suggests-a-self-portrait-with-help-from-friends.html,"The boy in the home movie, practicing at a ballet barre, has serious eyes flecked with fear. When the adult he became -- the American Ballet Theater principal dancer Daniil Simkin -- tells us that what he really wanted to be was a dentist, it's both funny and sad. Mr. Simkin is the son of Russian ballet dancers; his mother home-schooled him in their art. The dream of dentistry never had a chance.

The home movie appears in ""Intensio,"" the program that Mr. Simkin is presenting this week at the Joyce Theater. Does it say something about the isolating effect of his upbringing that he is cast as an outsider in several of the works commissioned for his personal project? That thread of possible insight into the man doesn't lead very far, but it's something to hang on to in what is otherwise a case of top-notch dancers, almost all friends from Ballet Theater, wasted on poor to mediocre material.

The program's first work sets the bar low. Jorma Elo's ""Nocturne/Etude/Prelude"" is a characteristically incoherent fit of hiccups. It's no fun to watch James Whiteside (with his hair, for some reason, dyed blue-white) and the radiant Isabella Boylston struggle valiantly to make sense of this nonsense. Mr. Simkin comes off worst: All the noodling crumples his less-than-steely bearing.

The short film ""Simkin and the City,"" by Alexander Ekman, is an amusing stunt, playing on the incongruity of Mr. Simkin's exhibiting ballet-prince behavior on the streets of Manhattan. Mr. Ekman's follow-up live dance piece, ""Simkin and the Stage,"" which includes the old movies and some reminiscence in voice-over, is more vague. Mr. Simkin looks no more at home in it, and its choppy construction exaggerates his inconsistency: bursts of brilliant elevation and effort arcing above a resting state of inelegance.","Daniil Simkin, a principal for American Ballet Theater, recruits some company colleagues and others for works by the likes of Jorma Elo and Annabelle Lopez Ochoa.",703eb542-4298-530b-b2f9-bbc0442c5131,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/07/arts/07INTENSIO/07INTENSIO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=d5d8643258a073cce31c709572a69ca8154fb52b86777839a9efa0eca239a6e1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, James Whiteside, Céline Cassone and Daniil Simkin in ""Islands of Memories,"" of Mr. Simkin's program ""Intensio"" at the Joyce.",703eb542-4298-530b-b2f9-bbc0442c5131,N24News/imgs/703eb542-4298-530b-b2f9-bbc0442c5131.jpg,6

To the rear, past the bar and through the kitchen, is a lounge. Mr. Vignola is serving inventive American fare like foie gras sliders, potato and mackerel terrine, slow-cooked halibut, rib-eye for two cooked two ways, and a duck burger. The restaurant is named for a Roman goddess of abundance. (Opens Wednesday)

Brian Washington-Palmer, a restaurateur, and Nikoa Evans-Hendricks, an expert in commercial development, discovered that the actress Ruby Dee had once lived in the building. What they have created is very now, especially when it comes to small plates like an updated Reuben sandwich and drinks made with miso syrup and kale juice, with decor firmly rooted in the midcentury-modern aesthetic.

Fashion & Style,The Met Gala Has Been Postponed 'Indefinitely',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/fashion/met-gala-postponed.html,"[Follow live coverage and photos from the Met Gala 2021.]

The Met Gala, the buzziest fashion-society-politics-celebrity gathering of the year, just ran out of time. On Monday, the museum announced that in order to avoid gatherings of 50 people or more, as per health guidance around the outbreak of the new coronavirus, ""all programs and events through May 15 will be canceled or postponed.""

That programming includes the annual fund-raising party, which heralds the opening of the Costume Institute's yearly blockbuster and has become the starriest draw of the New York gala circuit -- as well as its most lucrative. According to a spokesperson for the museum, no new date or further plans for the party, originally scheduled for May 4 and meant to unveil the show ""About Time: Fashion and Duration,"" had been announced.

Chaired by Anna Wintour, the artistic director of Conde Nast, the gala is both a party that attracts millions of eyeballs on social media as guests attempt to out-dress one another and a vehicle for securing the annual operating budget of the Costume Institute, the only curatorial department in the museum required to pay for itself.

Media,TV News: Truth Squad or Trump Infomercial?,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/18/business/media/republican-convention-will-push-limits-of-trump-and-the-news-media.html,"CLEVELAND -- In the months since he began pursuing the presidency, Donald J. Trump has exhibited a command over the national news media that is without parallel in modern times. The can't-look-away quality of his public persona and his media awareness have frequently pushed much of our national journalism into an unsavory corner where the imperatives of equal time, hard scrutiny and adherence to traditional standards have given way to the business lure of the huge television ratings and internet clicks that Mr. Trump uniquely provides. Still, nothing will test the news media like the next few days in Cleveland, where the Republican convention gets underway on Monday. Mr. Trump will have something that even he has never had; something that only presidents and major party nominees get. And that is nearly full control of the national media stage for four straight evenings in prime time, across not only cable news, but, at least for one hour every night, the broadcast networks as well. He has been planning to make full use of his time in his trademark way, with daily themes that will weave in staples of hot-button topics from talk radio and the Fox News Channel's opinion programs: Bill Clinton's infidelity, Hillary Clinton's response to the attack on the American compound in Benghazi, and immigration.

How far Mr. Trump goes with that convention approach, first reported by Jeremy W. Peters of The New York Times last week, remains to be seen; one never knows. But some of it promises to border on spectacle, to put it mildly. (Let me repeat: Among the potential themes is Mr. Clinton's sex life.) It could be one of those events that we look back on as a defining moment in American media, especially for the television networks: Did they once again this year hand themselves over to a Trumpian infomercial -- the ultimate Trump infomercial -- and bask in the ratings? Or did they rediscover their vital role of providing context, perspective and truth in a contest that is not a countdown-clock-worthy sporting event or reality show, but a competition for the presidency of the United States in fraught and dangerous times? Truth will not come to the fore without hard work and, potentially, a fight. The robust fact-checking industry that has sprung up over the past several years will have to work overtime during both conventions. But while Mrs. Clinton's dossier of falsehoods has increased with the F.B.I. report contradicting so many of her statements about her private email server, Mr. Trump and his campaign have generated so many untruths that Factcheck.org declared that in the 12 years since its founding, ""we've never seen his match."" And that was before this year began. His convention could surprise everyone and stick to only verified attacks, while coming off as a more traditional affair. But many of Mr. Trump's expected convention subjects have generated their share of false, unsubstantiated or wildly exaggerated assertions -- that Mrs. Clinton ""slept through"" the Benghazi attack (false); that the current administration is financing illegal immigration (false); and that it is not vetting refugees from the Middle East (false).

It's telling that in one of its last personnel moves before the convention's start on Monday, the Trump campaign hired a new ""director of rapid response,"" Steven Cheung. His primary responsibility will not be to combat the claims of the opposition -- the usual job of political rapid response -- but rather to take on the reportage of the news media. Even more telling was Mr. Cheung's pedigree. He last served as the spokesman for Ultimate Fighting Championship, the mixed-martial-arts league where opponents seek to beat each other into submission -- in a fenced-in octagon that's practically a cage. Quicken Loans Arena here may serve as the ultimate cage, given that Mr. Trump has maintained a blacklist of reporters, has vowed to loosen libel laws as president and is featuring at the convention the Silicon Valley billionaire who is seeking to put Gawker Media out of business through financing multiple lawsuits, Peter Thiel. The situation puts a whole new twist on the quadrennial question about how news organizations should cover the national political conventions, which were once conclaves for the real work of nominating presidents and vice presidents but went on to become mere media messaging pageants.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30. With that turn, a certain cat-and-mouse game developed between the networks and the convention planners over how much of the action on the main convention stage would be beamed directly into Americans' living rooms unfiltered, especially in earlier, prime-time hours, before the top-billed speaking slate begins. That segment -- guaranteed full coverage on the broadcast networks -- now represents only a single hour on television. The networks will usually cut away to their own anchors and analysts -- their stars -- when they deem the convention doings to be ratings downers. The top goal of the campaigns, then, is to ""hold the cameras,"" said Russ Schriefer, a Republican strategist who spearheaded convention planning for the Mitt Romney and George W. Bush campaigns. Of course, no candidate has been able to hold the cameras quite like Mr. Trump. And, given his reality show and self-marketing background, it has stood to reason that he would have a convention filled with television ratings bait.

Yet that came into doubt in recent days as some potential convention stars -- like the former N.F.L. quarterback Tim Tebow -- and major party leaders declined to participate. In a hopeful sign, the networks have made it clear to both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton that the same rules apply to the conventions that have applied to their coverage all year: The cameras will go to the ratings draws. ""Both campaigns know that keeping the attention of the networks -- and keeping the attention on their podium -- is their job, not the networks' job,"" said Chuck Todd, who is host of ""Meet the Press"" on NBC and ""MTP Daily"" on MSNBC, and also serves as NBC News political director. (NBC will team up with PolitiFact for the convention.) I wondered aloud to Mr. Todd what networks like his would do if the Trump campaign goes ahead with prime-time programming around the Clinton-era sex scandals, which would certainly be a first in televised convention history. There would be an element of ""Wow, we haven't seen that before,"" he told me, ""So it fits the definition of 'new' in the word 'news.'"" But, he added, ""Every network's going to make a different decision."" This is where the big test comes in. If the convention airs the most lurid claims made about Mr. Clinton -- such as the rape accusation made against him by the former Arkansas nursing home administrator Juanita Broaddrick, which Mr. Trump recently raised and Mr. Clinton's lawyer publicly denied long ago -- will the shock value overwhelm live news judgment? Even as Jay Wallace, Fox News Channel's executive vice president for news and editorial, told me that Mr. Trump's convention slate appeared to be ""playing to some portions of our audience"" -- those who tune in to the likes of Sean Hannity, whose show features many of the same themes -- he said, ""I don't feel like we're going to blow out our programming at certain hours for stuff like that.""

In fact, all of the network executives I spoke with last week repeated what Sam Feist, the CNN Washington bureau chief, told me -- that they would make decisions on the spot, on a ""case-by-case basis,"" and that regardless they would do aggressive fact-checking, for both conventions. That could prove vital, especially after the big post-10 p.m. speeches that will most likely be shown in full. You could imagine seeing Mr. Trump exhort the convention crowd against the news media if he is displeased with its coverage, which would be its own sort of spectacle. Mr. Schriefer, the Republican strategist, said Mr. Trump -- as well as Mrs. Clinton -- would be wise to remember that conventions are the first time many people ""turn on the television to decide, Can this man or woman be president of the United States?"" Those are the stakes. The news media would be wise to remember it, too.","With convention plans calling for spectacle, truth will not come to the fore without hard work by the media and, potentially, a fight.",78f3fb19-753f-548f-a39f-7b2c9a0fb3a6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/18/business/18rutenberg3/18rutenberg3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=97e8ac9dcd9a4910dc4a3966e607843e9e4acedc6d68ccaf11c85f914034ccab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Donald J.

Your Money,How Big Do You Want Your Nest Egg to Be?,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/your-money/how-big-do-you-want-your-nest-egg-to-be.html,"How Big Do You Want Your Nest Egg to Be?

Twenty million dollars. That's how much Julien Mellon needs to live the life he wants. With that kind of cash, Mr. Mellon, a 32-year-old tour guide, could buy a ""beautiful"" home with enough left over to spend $100,000 a year (""in 2017 dollars"") until the day he dies. That same number would also work for Celeste Hilling, the founder, chief and product formulator at Skin Authority. Twenty million would allow her to put her 17-year-old daughter through college, ""give to philanthropy -- especially women's and children's causes -- start another company, and travel as part of work combined with personal pursuits,"" said Ms. Hilling, 58. And then there is Susan Sosnow, a real estate investor and landlord. All Ms. Sosnow, 49, needs to feel secure is $36,000 a year. Really. She nets a fraction of that as a landlord. Explaining the relatively low figure, she said: ""I'm not interested in traveling; I'm interested in creating paradise at home, Candyland. I'm still driving the '99 Ford Escort wagon I bought for $3,200 cash in 2004. But sometimes it sits in my driveway for a week and I just ride my bike around.""

Money may not buy happiness, but it can certainly buy freedom and security, which contribute mightily to happiness. It also helps alleviate sadness, as a 2015 paper found. In the study, researchers examined data from over 12,000 Americans. Wealthier individuals did not experience greater feelings of happiness on a day-to-day basis, but they did experience reduced feelings of sadness. ""We argue that this reduction in sadness occurs because money provides a sense of perceived control,"" said Elizabeth W. Dunn, a psychology professor at the University of British Columbia and a co-author of the paper. She also co-authored the book ""Happy Money: The Science of Happier Spending.""

Jill Falcon, 46, a single stay-at-home mother of a 4-year-old, agrees. While she does not believe there is a number to buy happiness, ""Money buys safety, convenience, luxury,"" she said. ""It can reduce worries and stress. I would love the freedom money would bring."" At a time when the ranks of the ultrawealthy -- millionaires and even billionaires -- are on the rise, the magic number for many people is surprisingly modest. Celeste Hilling would like $20 million. The founder, chief and product formulator at Skin Authority, Ms. Hilling would put her 17-year-old daughter through college, support causes for women and children, start another company and travel. Sandy Huffaker for The New York Times So how much is ""enough""? Clearly, the definition of enough depends on where you live and your responsibilities. Ms. Sosnow is single and lives in Gainesville, Fla., which is significantly less expensive than San Diego, where Ms. Hilling lives with her husband and daughter, or Brooklyn, where Mr. Mellon resides. For Ms. Falcon, ""enough"" is somewhere between $8 million and $10 million, so she could give her daughter ""the best of everything,"" as she put it: ""Private school, college, money for an advanced degree at an Ivy League university, two homes, unlimited vacations. Retirement. Cars, gas, food, shelter, extras. I'd also like to make sure my mom is set for life not having to worry about money."" But it's not pure hedonism. Ms. Falcon also wants to contribute to charity. So does Andrea Todd. Her number hovers around $65 million. With that she would travel with her family. But ""I see that as an educational experience more than a luxury item purchased with a windfall,"" said Ms. Todd, 51, a writer and teacher in Sacramento who is married with three children. ""We'd travel cheap and dirty, with immersion in mind."" But she would also buy a farm for animals, as Jon Stewart and his wife, Tracey, did. While Ms. Todd would continue teaching at Cristo Rey, a Catholic high school in Sacramento, she would not take a salary. She would also give money to all her alma maters that would be used for tuition. ""I worked my way through Catholic school and college,"" she said. ""It would make me very happy to ensure other students were relieved of that stress.""

""We have a half mil in the bank, and I panic all the time about not having enough,"" Ms. Todd said. In addition to her parents and in-laws, all of whom are in their 90s ""with two pension plans possibly running out,"" her two children will be heading to college in the next five years. She also has a $500,000 home with $400,000 still owed on it and a retirement fund that did not begin until 2002, when her husband graduated from law school.

Others would like enough money to allow them to pursue other interests. Valerie Smaldone, a media personality and brand strategist in New York, who declined to give her age, said she could make it work with a monthly stipend of $10,000 for the rest of her life. She'd like a minimum of $250,000 in retirement income on top of that, which would continue to appreciate yearly. She doesn't plan to ever stop working, but if she had ""stupid money"" to live off, she said, she would ""produce a film or a play, or provide funding to animals who are abused. Learn something I always wanted to learn. Take a serious wine course, or do something in the food industry."" Melissa Soalt, the founder of global self-defense programs for women, would be set with a cool $5 million. ""Being self-employed often means having to 'sing for my supper,'"" said Ms. Soalt, 61, of Amherst, Mass. ""This would take some of the pressure off. It would not only make my life more secure -- I would purchase a modest home -- but allow me to do more to help the world."" ""Without the actual money, things remain realistically out of reach,"" she added. Kendall Rush, 47 and a grandfather, knows exactly how he would allocate his fantasy $6 million: He would take $2 million to pay off debts for himself and his immediate family, secure housing and transportation, and set up a communal trust fund with the rest for emergencies and medical. ""The third million would go toward relocation of myself and my household,"" Mr. Rush, a help-desk administrator for the Niagara Frontier Transportation Authority in Buffalo, wrote in an email. ""Half a million for educational trust fund for kids and family. Half a million in personal accounts for day-to-day expenses. One million for investments stocks/bonds. One million to invest in small, local businesses.""

As he got older and made money, he felt the need to show off all the trappings of his rich life. ""I remember buying a Porsche and then a Bentley because it looked better,"" he said. He has also owned a Ferrari. He got rid of them (now he collects motorcycles -- he has nine), but he is fond of his lifestyle. So if for some reason he could no longer work, he would like $10 million. ""Ten million dollars wouldn't affect my lifestyle and allow me to continue it,"" which includes zipping around the world at a moment's notice, he said. Lynne Dewhurst McBurney, 50, who manages litigation for a financial services company and lives with her husband and son in Ridgewood, N.J., would not quit her job if she got her $6 million. But she might retire earlier. ""Maybe it's a secret homage to Lee Majors,"" she said, referring to the actor who played the lead in ""The Six Million Dollar Man,"" a 1970s television show. ""But it's more like, own my home plus a pied-a-terre in Paris, and a cottage in Maine, and live off interest income from the $4 million we'd have left,"" she said. Mr. Mellon has a more visceral reason for how he arrived at his $20 million number. ""The real story for me personally is how bad it hurts that I don't believe I will ever be able to own a home in the place where I grew up,"" said Mr. Mellon, who was raised in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. The actress Michelle Williams ""bought the house I grew up dreaming of"" in the Victorian Flatbush Historic District, said Mr. Mellon. If housing weren't an issue, he would need very little: just enough to invest so he would never need to work again. ""If I assume that I can own it outright, I imagine having enough to replace the boiler and fix the roof and keep up with my membership at MoMA,"" he said. As for Ms. Sosnow, her life is simple and straightforward. ""If I wanted more money, I could pursue it, but why?"" she said.","A sampling indicates people's calculations typically range into seven (or even eight) figures.

Technology,Keeping Gear (and Herself) Warm at the Winter Olympics,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/technology/personaltech/tech-gear-warm-winter-olympics.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Talya Minsberg, a social strategy editor for The Times who is in Pyeongchang, South Korea, to cover the Winter Olympics, discussed the tech she's using. As a social strategy editor for The Times, what tech do you use on the job the most? The short answer isn't an exciting one: It's my iPhone. An iPhone 7 at that. Part of the job of a social editor is thinking about how readers find news where they already are -- on social channels like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat. So I try to consume news like we know many of our readers do, from their phones. When I'm in charge of what goes out on our social channels, I use a MacBook and one extra monitor, nothing too fancy. The key is having a handful of listening tools at the ready. That means I'm one of those people who have an obnoxious amount of tabs up at once. Crowdtangle, a social media analytics tool, Chartbeat, Tweetdeck, Facebook ... I could go on.

I also listen to a good amount of music that can help me zone in on my work. So I'm a frequent user of Spotify and live performances I have favorited on YouTube. How much social media do you consume for work, what forms of it do you consume the most, and how do you handle the deluge?

As most social media editors can attest, the job demands consuming a lot of media in all forms. Day to day, Twitter takes up most of my time and energy. I also dedicate a good amount of my attention to Facebook, Reddit and Instagram at the office. I'm very much still working on how I handle the deluge. Some days it feels like I'm always taking in information, from the moment I wake up and start listening to NPR. Creating methods to narrow down the ""need to know"" helps me cut out some of the noise. That could be a zooming in on sources pertinent to a story I'm working on or top news. Either way, creating lists and advanced searches on Twitter is invaluable. I also follow specific subreddits, track trending terms, and use Google Alerts.

That being said, I've found it's helpful for my mental well-being to take one day a week off from social media. For me, that's Saturday. It feels like a weekly cleanse and sometimes it's truly a challenge, which makes me realize just how much I really need to push myself to do it. For one day a week, I try to use my phone as one thing and one thing only: a way to text and call family and friends. Radical, isn't it? You're at the Winter Olympics as part of a team to cover the event. What tech preparations did you need to make to be ready for coverage? My first priority was ensuring I have a secure backup for everything. If something happens to my phone or computer, I wanted to make sure that wouldn't completely derail my work. I use a password manager, have two-step verification on everything that allows it, and keep lots of stuff in the cloud. I've also kicked my listening tools usage into high gear. That means a wealth of new lists, alerts and threads I'm watching that are Olympics- and sport-specific. Do you have to keep any tech gear warm in the chilly temperatures in Pyeongchang, and how do you plan to do so? Yes! As many have experienced, phones can die quickly in the cold. Since temperatures have been hovering between zero and 30 degrees Fahrenheit, I thought about creative ways to keep my gear warm and charged. I ordered dozens and dozens of hand warmers that I plan on also using as phone warmers. The backup plan to that backup plan is having more than one phone on me, and more than one external charger on me.

That being said, none of my gear will do me any good if I'm an ice cube. So I thought about keeping myself warm too. SmartWool socks are my Olympic fashion staple. What is our social media strategy set to be at the Winter Olympics? I'll tell you about the tool I'm most excited about -- a new messaging system with one of our sports editors, Sam Manchester. Sam will be sending messages from the Olympics to readers within The New York Times app. There are a handful of exciting things you'll see on the messaging app. But perhaps most exciting is the fact that you will actually be able to talk to Sam, who is a real-life human and not a bot! He's going to be your man on the ground who will take you behind the scenes of the Games in all their excitement and quirkiness. Outside of work, what tech product are you in love with using in your daily life right now? MoviePass, which provides a subscription plan so members get movie tickets at a cheaper price. I wasn't a big moviegoer and this has completely transformed my habits overnight. What could be better about it? The most frustrating feature is that you have to be within 100 yards of a theater to reserve tickets. I wish you could reserve tickets in advance without being there. I don't see a reason against it, especially if there was a penalty for not showing up at the movie after reserving tickets to dissuade no shows, a la ClassPass. What do you do to get away from social media? I get moving. I've been an avid runner since I was a little kid, and there's nothing that makes me happier than a good long run. I'm hoping to get in some runs in the very early mornings in Pyeongchang, SmartWool included.","Covering the Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, requires some preparations when it comes to making sure your tech (and your feet) work as intended.",9d76c2cb-cf7c-57d2-9f24-89be090bc0dc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/07/business/08TECHUSING-1/08TECHUSING-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=4fe4bbf0554e7f106f153b8c8e7621185f8a12436bcc37268e1256f685fac109&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Talya Minsberg checking her Garmin watch while jogging in Prospect Park in Brooklyn.

Health,Lightning Struck Her Home. Then Her Brain Implant Stopped Working.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/health/lightning-brain-implants.html,"One stormy afternoon in Ljubljana, the capital of Slovenia, thunder rolled, a bolt of lightning streaked across the sky, and the television and air conditioner went dark in the apartment of a woman with electrodes implanted in her brain.

But the appliances were not the only things affected. After about an hour, the woman, who had had the electrodes put in five years before to help with debilitating muscle spasms in her neck, noticed her symptoms coming back. When she went to see her doctors the next day, they found that the pacemaker-like stimulator that powered the electrodes had switched itself off in response to the lightning strike.

In a study describing these events published Tuesday in the Journal of Neurosurgery, her doctors suggest that physicians and medical device companies add lightning strikes to the list of things patients with electrodes implanted in their brains should watch out for.

It may sound futuristic, but deep brain stimulation, or D.B.S., has a fairly long history. Surgeons operating on epileptic patients in the 1930s and 1940s found that removing small portions of the brain could quiet seizures. Later, researchers found that stimulating certain brain areas, instead of cutting them out, could quell the involuntary movements characteristic of Parkinson's and other disorders.",Doctors suggested that electrical storms be added to the list of things patients with electrodes implanted in their brains should watch out for.,8a6370fd-c8f6-52cb-9893-883d06daa214,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/04/science/04TB-LIGHTNING/04TB-LIGHTNING-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=9021e790bb0fec0b61f8322e625d73951dc370815761bbeeadcb2426c8e91a46&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A Slovenian woman's brain stimulator — which helped keep her neck spasms in check — stopped working after her home was struck by lightning last year.,8a6370fd-c8f6-52cb-9893-883d06daa214,N24News/imgs/8a6370fd-c8f6-52cb-9893-883d06daa214.jpg,1
Real Estate,$32 Million Sale on Fifth Avenue,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/realestate/32-million-sale-on-fifth-avenue.html,"The chief executive of the Loews Corporation, James S. Tisch, purchased through a trust a sprawling apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue, an exclusive prewar co-op building designed by Rosario Candela and home to a host of prominent residents over the years, including Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.

At $32,000,000, it was the most expensive closed sale of the week, according to city property records.

The unit, No. 10A, was sold by Thomas D. Lehrman, a founder of the consulting business Gerson Lehrman Group, and his wife, Marjorie Lehrman. They had bought the apartment nearly eight years ago for $21 million from Edgar Bronfman Jr., a former chief executive of the Seagram Company, and did a comprehensive renovation led by the architectural firm Ferguson & Shamamian.

The most recent asking price was $32.5 million; the monthly maintenance is $11,360, according to the listing with Brown Harris Stevens.","The chief executive of Loews uses a trust to buy a sprawling apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue, an exclusive co-op designed by Rosario Candela.",1849e599-8d63-5acf-8c2d-99a626c3efeb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/07/realestate/07TICKET/07TICKET-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=234b2b279bd69e693614fdc63aaf7258f82ce40e69725d25ca70778254767d2a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The 17-story limestone apartment house at 1040 Fifth Avenue.,1849e599-8d63-5acf-8c2d-99a626c3efeb,N24News/imgs/1849e599-8d63-5acf-8c2d-99a626c3efeb.jpg,7
Science,Exxon Mobil Backs FuelCell Effort to Advance Carbon Capture Technology,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/science/exxon-mobil-backs-fuelcell-effort-to-advance-carbon-capture-technology.html,"For years, FuelCell Energy has been considered a company to watch. Its technology promised to help economically reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, which could help combat climate change. The Danbury, Conn., company might be able to make a difference, experts said, if only it had a partner with really deep pockets. In an agreement announced on Thursday, Exxon Mobil said it had tightened an existing relationship with FuelCell in hopes of taking the technology from the lab to the market. Any commercial development is years away, warned Vijay Swarup, vice president for research and development at Exxon Mobil Research and Engineering. But, he added, ""We think it's got the possibility to be a game changer."" Although the companies did not disclose the size of Exxon Mobil's investment in FuelCell, ""We're putting the necessary resources behind this to take the research to the next level,"" Dr. Swarup said.

The technology -- known as carbon capture and sequestration, or C.C.S.-- is an important but challenging potential solution to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to take carbon dioxide, after it is removed from exhaust steam, and to lock it away by pumping it into the ground or use it in industrial applications. Reducing the amount of carbon dioxide released by power plants could provide a bridge of sorts to the use of energy sources that do not emit greenhouse gases, said Emily A. Carter, founding director of the Andlinger Center for Energy and the Environment at Princeton University. While many climate activists demand an immediate shift to renewable power sources like solar and wind, ""We're going to be burning fossil fuels for the vast majority of our electricity for some time to come, whether we like it or not,"" she said. ""We desperately need C.C.S."" Carbon capture has not yet fulfilled its promise, in large part because of the enormous amounts of energy required in conventional processes to separate carbon dioxide from power plant exhaust and to compress it. Those processes greatly diminish the power output of the plant and raise the cost of the electricity produced.

What Exxon Mobil's partner brings to this thorny problem is its particular class of fuel cells -- devices that generate electricity through chemical reactions. The company's fuel cells are already used to provide clean energy in about 50 locations around the world but without a connection to fossil-fuel power plants, as envisioned in the new agreement. The fuel cells use a high-temperature molten carbonate salt mixture. Carbon dioxide flows into the fuel cell and emerges in a concentrated form that is ready for storage. It is this idea of matching up power plants, which produce carbon dioxide, with fuel cells that are hungry for it that led to a collaboration between Exxon Mobil and FuelCell that started more than four years ago. The result, at least so far in the laboratory, is that the fuel cells effectively isolate and compress the carbon dioxide while producing enough power to more than make up for the energy cost of capturing the carbon. Exxon Mobil estimates that a 500-megawatt power plant with these fuel cells could generate 120 megawatts of additional power, compared with a loss of 50 megawatts of power using conventional carbon capture technology. The company estimates that using these fuel cells with natural gas power plants could lead to a reduction of more than 90 percent in the plants' carbon dioxide emissions, while also producing large amounts of useful hydrogen.

FuelCell Energy's products can also strip 70 percent of the smog-producing oxides of nitrogen from the exhaust of coal-burning power plants. Chip Bottone, president and chief executive officer of FuelCell Energy, said he hoped the research would lead to a process that could be incorporated in power plants around the world. ""When you can make it affordable with private capital, everybody wins,"" he said. Such a high-profile effort to fight climate change could be interpreted by critics of the company as an attempt to improve the public image of Exxon Mobil at a time that it is under investigation by state attorneys general and news organizations, and attacked for its past funding of organizations that denied climate change. Alan Jeffers, a spokesman for Exxon Mobil, said that he expected activists to accuse the company of engaging in a public relations stunt to burnish its reputation, but he added, ""That's untrue."" Noting the four-year history of the work with FuelCell, he said the research would continue for years to come. Professor Carter of Princeton said, ""The idea of merging these two technologies to get something that's greater than the sum of its parts is terrific."" ""It's preliminary,"" she said of the collaboration, which she learned of before the official announcement.","The energy giant is investing in FuelCell Energy's technology for carbon capture and sequestration, a potential way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.",c9eb68ae-d92b-5c26-b2a3-7b93c39e6faa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/05/science/05CARBON/05CARBON-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=3225411526c19688a53a3511cabe040a37143b706ccfd1d2c15d99cf0b680c01&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A fuel cell used to capture and sequester carbon emissions, at the headquarters of FuelCell Energy in Danbury, Conn.",c9eb68ae-d92b-5c26-b2a3-7b93c39e6faa,N24News/imgs/c9eb68ae-d92b-5c26-b2a3-7b93c39e6faa.jpg,2
Technology,"Twitter Adds Warnings to Trump and White House Tweets, Fueling Tensions",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/29/technology/trump-twitter-minneapolis-george-floyd.html,"Twitter said the tweets, which implied that protesters in Minneapolis could be shot, glorified violence -- the first time it had applied such warnings to any public figure's posts.

The decision to add the new warning labels was approved by Jack Dorsey, Twitter's chief executive, after a late-night debate among company officials, said a person with knowledge of the deliberations. Twitter further tightened restrictions on the messages from Mr. Trump and the White House by blocking users from liking or replying to them, though people could still retweet the messages if they added a comment of their own. But Twitter did not go as far as taking the posts down, saying it was in the public's interest that the messages remain accessible.

The tussle began after Mr. Trump tweeted a hurtful and unsubstantiated conspiracy theory this month to attack the MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, which caused critics to call on Twitter to remove the messages. While Twitter did not take those posts down, it added fact-checking labels for the first time to two of the president's election-related posts on Tuesday. The labels stood out because Twitter for years did little to moderate Mr. Trump's often inaccurate and threatening posts. That immediately ignited Mr. Trump's ire. He accused Twitter of stifling free speech and said he would not allow the social media companies to operate unfettered. And in an apparent act of retaliation, he signed the executive order on Thursday taking aim at Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which provides the liability shield to the tech companies.

Twitter and Mr. Trump are now in a standoff. The company has said it will continue putting warning labels and restrictions on tweets that incite violence or spread false information about elections and the coronavirus. And Mr. Trump, who once tweeted up to 108 times a day this month, shows no signs of stopping his usage of the service, lashing out on Friday on Twitter about Twitter itself. ""Twitter is doing nothing about all of the lies & propaganda being put out by China or the Radical Left Democrat Party,"" he wrote. ""They have targeted Republicans, Conservatives & the President of the United States. Section 230 should be revoked by Congress. Until then, it will be regulated!"" He posted several other tweets citing similar views by his favorite Fox News hosts. And as if daring Twitter, he posted another message about looting leading to shooting on Friday afternoon.

In its separate Twitter account, the White House jabbed directly at Mr. Dorsey: ""The President did not glorify violence. He clearly condemned it. @Jack and Twitter's biased, bad-faith 'fact-checkers' have made it clear: Twitter is a publisher, not a platform."" And Dan Scavino, the president's deputy chief of staff, said Twitter should be targeting the protesters in Minneapolis. ""Twitter is targeting the President of the United States 24/7, while turning their heads to protest organizers who are planning, plotting, and communicating their next moves daily on this very platform,"" he wrote. He added that Twitter was full of it and ""more and more people are beginning to get it."" Twitter said it had decided to restrict Mr. Trump's tweet about the protests in Minnesota ""based on the historical context of the last line, its connection to violence, and the risk it could inspire similar actions today."" It had applied a warning label on a tweet from the Brazilian minister of citizenship, Osmar Terra, last month, but the label was not for glorifying violence. Mr. Dorsey also tweeted on Friday morning that social networks' fact-checking process should use open-source technology -- software that is created and shared for general use -- and be verifiable by everyone. He did not respond to a request for comment. The conflict has thrown Twitter into chaos, with employees racing to take action on Mr. Trump's tweets while also scrambling to protect themselves from harassment. After Mr. Trump and his allies lashed out at one Twitter employee who had publicly criticized Mr. Trump and other Republican leaders, other employees removed their company affiliation from their social media profiles or locked their accounts from public view. First Amendment scholars said Friday that Mr. Trump and his allies had it backward and that he was the one trying to stifle speech that clashed with his own views. ""Fundamentally this dispute is about whether Twitter has the right to disagree with, criticize, and respond to the president,"" said Jameel Jaffer, executive director at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. ""Obviously, it does. It is remarkable and truly chilling that the president and his advisers seem to believe otherwise.""

Revoking Section 230 protections would expose Twitter and other online platforms to expansive potential legal vulnerability that could undermine the fundamentals of their businesses. But it would also remove the very legal standard that has allowed Mr. Trump to use Twitter so effectively to communicate with his more than 80 million followers -- no matter how incendiary, false and even defamatory his messages may be. Without a liability shield, Twitter and online companies would be forced to police accounts like Mr. Trump's even more closely to guard themselves against legal action. Twitter has for years faced criticism over Mr. Trump's posts on the platform. The company has said repeatedly that the president did not violate its terms of service, however much he appeared to skirt the line. It has also said that blocking world leaders from the service or removing their tweets would hinder public debate. Twitter did announce last year, however, that it would in certain cases place warning labels on posts from political figures that broke its rules, the feature it used with Mr. Trump's tweet about Minneapolis. Mr. Trump's message implying that the Minneapolis protesters could be shot was also posted on his official Facebook page, where it appears without any warning labels. Mark Zuckerberg, the company's chief executive, told Fox News this week that he was uncomfortable with Facebook's being ""the arbiter of truth of everything that people say online."" Protests have raged in Minneapolis this week over the death on Monday of George Floyd, a black man who had been pinned down by a white police officer who pressed his knee on Mr. Floyd's neck. Frederike Kaltheuner, a tech policy fellow at the Mozilla Foundation, said Twitter's confrontation with Mr. Trump raised questions about how the platform would treat other world leaders. In March, the company deleted posts by the presidents of Brazil and Venezuela that contained unproven information about Covid-19 treatments.","Twitter said the tweets, which implied that protesters in Minneapolis could be shot, glorified violence — the first time it had applied such warnings to any public figure's posts.",e54bb0dc-7751-5c61-bd76-0fe23e4fcc3a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/29/world/29trump-twitter-1/29trump-twitter-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=d2e198fb8a1fdb67c27a4a1dddcd57929ad213e2d8b68ac54bd83e2529ea72e2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,President Trump on Thursday signed an executive order meant to limit social media companies' legal protections against liability claims.,e54bb0dc-7751-5c61-bd76-0fe23e4fcc3a,N24News/imgs/e54bb0dc-7751-5c61-bd76-0fe23e4fcc3a.jpg,20
Fashion & Style,"Pausing to Remember Franca Sozzani, Italian Vogue Editor",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/28/fashion/franca-sozzani-italian-vogue-editor-memorial.html,"MILAN -- Milan and the rest of the fashion world stepped off the ready-to-wear hamster wheel this week to pay tribute to Franca Sozzani, the longtime editor of Italian Vogue, who died in December at 66. The winter sky was slate gray on Monday afternoon as the great and the good of the industry gathered in the Duomo, the city's massive Gothic cathedral, for a service in Ms. Sozzani's memory. Crowds thronged behind safety barriers outside as hundreds of mourners filed in.

Stella McCartney, Christopher Bailey, Victoria Beckham, Phoebe Philo and Sarah Burton flew in from London. Alber Elbaz, Bruno Frisoni, Sidney Toledano and Francois-Henri Pinault came from Paris. Pierpaolo Piccioli, Maria Grazia Chiuri, Giorgio Armani, Miuccia Prada and Valentino Garavani were there; so, too, were the supermodels Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell and Eva Herzigova, and the photographers Mario Testino, Peter Lindbergh and Mario Sorrenti. Members of the Fendi, Versace, Pucci, Missoni and Ferretti families were in attendance, as was Matteo Renzi, the former Italian prime minister, and Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, the former first lady of France.

The Catholic Mass, conducted in Italian, had been arranged by Giuseppe Sala, the mayor of Milan; Carlo Capasa, president of Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana, the Italian fashion industry organization; and Jonathan Newhouse, chairman and chief executive of Conde Nast International, the parent company of Italian Vogue. Before the memorial, Ms. Sozzani's family had invited some of the attendees to a light lunch, held across the piazza from the Duomo.

Alessandro Grassani for The New York Times

Ms. Sozzani, once described by this newspaper as ""a daring and often impious iconoclast on the newsstand,"" was widely respected for reshaping the job of a fashion editor during her 28 years at the helm of Italian Vogue. She often used the magazine as a platform for activism, tackling controversial topics like race, domestic violence, plastic surgery and drug addiction. She also made a point of championing young and emerging talents, particularly in her home country, where the industry has often proved resistant to change.

Her niece Sara Maino, head of talent at Italian Vogue, gave one of two readings during the service. The other came from Ms. Sozzani's only child, Francesco Carrozzini, a film director, whose documentary on his mother's life made its debut at the Venice Film Festival in September.

Economy,"When Professionals Rise Up, More Than Money Is at Stake",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/25/business/economy/labor-professionals.html,"Credit...Kristian Thacker for The New York Times



When Professionals Rise Up, More Than Money Is at Stake



When 20,000 West Virginia teachers staged a rare statewide walkout, questions of pay and benefits dominated the headlines. But those concerns could not fully account for the teachers' ferocious resolve. After all, stagnant wages and receding benefits have been an issue for workers for decades. The missing variable appears to have been anxiety about their status as professionals. Fred Albert, a math teacher and local union official in the Charleston area, said many felt that the Legislature had devalued their training and certification by proposing to let people teach a subject they hadn't studied and had no experience in. ""If someone really wants to be a teacher, if they feel the call to be in the classroom with students, they need to go through the same programs we went through,"" he said. In that sense, Mr. Albert and his colleagues were in the mainstream of recent labor history. From doctors and nurses to government workers and journalists, some of the most aggressive and successful labor actions in recent years have erupted when professionals felt their judgment, expertise and autonomy were under assault.

Teachers in Oklahoma, who are threatening a walkout on April 2, have expressed similar frustrations, as have adjunct faculty members at a college in Florida and the recently unionized staff of The Los Angeles Times. Robert Bruno, a professor of labor relations at the University of Illinois, said that while compensation and job security were often core concerns, ""what really generates this explosion of resistance among professional workers is when they feel they're the last line of defense between the public they serve and others who would threaten the professionalism of their work."" Some professions, like law and medicine, began to take their modern form in the late 19th century and early 20th century, as science became more rigorous and knowledge became more specialized. Other occupations, like journalism, became more professionalized later in the 20th century by developing an agreed-upon set of norms and best practices. In most cases, said Tracey Adams, a sociologist who studies professions at the University of Western Ontario, the workers tended to be driven by a sense that they were improving society, not just adding to the bottom line. In return, the public and government officials often deferred to them in the areas where they asserted authority. This netted them the resources to do their jobs, the independence to exercise their judgment and widespread public esteem. That has changed in the past few decades, however. ""I think that most professions would find that there are a number of forces chipping away at a lot of those tangible and less tangible benefits,"" Professor Adams said. ""Increasingly people say, 'I'm not sure I trust you more than the next person.'""

In January, those concerns were in evidence when journalists at The Los Angeles Times, which for more than 100 years stood as one of the most anti-union employers in the industry, voted overwhelmingly to unionize. According to Matt Pearce, a national correspondent who served on the organizing committee, many colleagues were initially ambivalent about unionizing. But that changed when the paper became embroiled in a standoff with the Walt Disney Company, which had denied its journalists access to advance movie screenings in response to an investigative series about the company. After the paper's newly installed editor, Lewis D'Vorkin, appeared to resist covering the controversy and later criticized reporters for sharing a recording with The New York Times in which he discussed the matter internally, support for the union grew. ""It was a very fundamental thing over journalistic principles that had a radicalizing effect on a lot of people in the newsroom,"" Mr. Pearce said. Referring to both the newspaper's leadership and its corporate parent, he added, ""There was a palpable sense that they had no patience for the doctrinaire traditional rituals of newspaper journalism.""

Doctors and nurses have also reacted viscerally when they believed that managers were limiting their autonomy and disregarding their judgment. In 2014, doctors at an Oregon medical center voted to create a union after their employer proposed outsourcing management of their group. Such a change, now common in the profession, could have increased their pay, but the doctors worried about being forced to see more patients in a day than they could safely treat.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The hospital eventually abandoned the outsourcing initiative and agreed to a contract addressing most of the doctors' concerns after about 18 months of bargaining. Nurses at the community hospital in Altoona, Pa., briefly went on strike that same year, not long after their facility became part of the Pittsburgh-based medical behemoth UPMC. The nurses felt that management was leaving their hospital understaffed, and that their new overseers had no time for their input. Paula Stellabotte, a nurse at the hospital, said that her colleagues had won some concessions but that adequate staffing remained a struggle, along with having a say in hospital policies. ""It always amazed me that they had money for consultants, but we're right here,"" Ms. Stellabotte said. ""They don't need to pay consultants."" At Hillsborough Community College in the Tampa, Fla., area, adjunct faculty members unionized in 2016, provoked by their meager compensation and a sense that the administration had no respect for their expertise. Cheryl DeFlavis, an adjunct sociology professor, said the main issue was ""exclusion from the policies that shape campus life."" For example, she said, she and her fellow adjuncts teach a significant portion of the classes on campus but have almost no say over textbook choice.

Still, public-school teachers have arguably endured the most direct challenge to their professionalism in recent years. ""There has been a decade, two decades of bipartisan attempts to reform education that left out teachers,"" Professor Bruno, the labor-relations expert, said. ""They've seen it in a million small cuts, and some other really large frontal bludgeonings."" In some districts around the country, for example, teachers have been required to clock in and out each day on a computerized clock, in the tradition of factory workers. ""It was different because we're not considered hourly employees. We're salaried,"" said Beverly Reynolds, the president of the teachers' union in Davidson County, N.C. ""Some of them were sitting there thinking, 'I clock out, but then I get home and do three hours of work at night.'"" (The county superintendent agreed to end the clocking-out portion of the ritual in 2016 after years of complaints. The practice continues in other districts.)

And teachers across the country bemoan the rise of merit-based pay incentives and the growing use of standardized test scores for their evaluations. Some of these frustrations boiled over into a tense, seven-day teachers' strike in Chicago in 2012, which was widely seen as a flash point in the national debate over more businesslike approaches to managing schools. As a result of the strike, teachers reduced the portion of their evaluation based on student test scores to 30 percent, from a proposed 40 percent. ""It was just ridiculous -- not a way to show what I'm doing in the classroom,"" said Lillian Kass, who teaches high school special education in Chicago. The anger shows little sign of dissipating. In Oklahoma, teachers complain of being near the bottom in the country in pay. But some say it is the near-collapse of their profession in the state that has truly demoralized them. Ed Allen, president of the local teachers' union in Oklahoma City, said there were about 2,000 emergency certified teachers in the state, exempted from traditional certification requirements to fill staff shortages. In some schools, such teachers account for nearly half the faculty. ""God bless people who are trying to get in and help learn a new profession, but these folks come in at square one,"" Mr. Allen said. ""They don't know lesson plans, rules and procedures. They don't know grading."" As teachers see it, he added, ""this is just a symptom of a lack of respect for our profession.""",The teacher uprising that began in West Virginia has exposed a trend among white-collar workers: a feeling that their credentials are being devalued.,9d41c997-cb21-5aa9-8b4a-9cd5f60d72bc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/business/00LABOR-alpha/00LABOR-alpha-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=312650cf8630538b2593353988ea4f933962b8030b43ab0209ee7c1204cdfbab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fred Albert, a math teacher in the Charleston area of West Virginia, said many teachers felt that the Legislature had devalued their training and certification by proposing to let people teach a subject they hadn't studied and had no experience in.",9d41c997-cb21-5aa9-8b4a-9cd5f60d72bc,N24News/imgs/9d41c997-cb21-5aa9-8b4a-9cd5f60d72bc.jpg,8
Books,The Penetrating Gaze of One of America's Most Brilliant Art Critics,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/books/review/hot-cold-heavy-light-peter-schjeldahl.html,"Whatever chips a critic might accumulate for honesty or temperance, for reading backlists, for punctuality or for nodding politely when yet another person recommends ""All the Light We Cannot See,"" for whatever, I would like to push all of mine to the center of the table on behalf of the following statement: Peter Schjeldahl is a great artist. It's unseemly to be so categorical, but the fact that Schjeldahl himself is an art critic -- in its heyday for The Village Voice, since 1998 for The New Yorker -- necessitates the vehemence. Is criticism an art? It's a valid, exhausting question. Criticism follows other people's work; then again, so does all human invention. What lab-pure operant-conditioning chamber do we imagine ""real"" artists spring from? Regardless of your position, anyway, Schjeldahl's thrilling new collection, ""Hot, Cold, Heavy, Light: 100 Art Writings, 1988-2018,"" takes that poor old beast of a debate out of harness and sets it free in rolling country pastures. For now. His specialty is the searching, summative essay of a few pages on a single artist. (Spearing ""that little eel in the middle -- that marrow,"" as Virginia Woolf wrote.) Journalism may have imposed the format upon him, but it's also, by happy chance, the ideal medium for his gifts. Like Lydia Davis, he writes with remarkable tensile beauty and closeness of observation. Any dilation of either's work tends to diminish it.

Take Schjeldahl on Picasso, an artist who obviates the anxiety that the critic's line of work is dependent on insider knowledge. In a review of a show that ranges over ""a period of grueling brilliance, when Picasso kept junking and reassembling the female physiognomy like God,"" he gives discerning historical and artistic context first. Then he expands his attention. ""Picasso was simple in the ways that counted,"" he writes. ""People make the mistake of supposing that genius is complicated. It is the opposite. We regular folks are complicated -- tied in knots of ambivalence and befogged with uncertainties. Genius has the economy of a machine with a minimum of moving parts. Everything about Picasso came to bear when he drew a line.""

With artist after artist in ""Hot, Cold, Heavy, Light,"" Schjeldahl arrives at some similarly unexpected yet exacting truth. (I will never forget -- really -- the shock of tuning-fork accuracy when I first read his superficially odd claim that the motivating emotion in the work of Jeff Koons is rage.) He has the ability to freeze an artist cold in a line, not through aphorism, which implies a slinking away from the specific, but with meticulous, writerly precision. On de Kooning, for instance: ""His art is not abstract, just relentlessly abstracting."" (I have always thought that -- I just never thought it.) Toulouse-Lautrec ""embedded art in an imperishable present tense like no one else until Andy Warhol,"" while Karen Kilimnik's eerie portraits of celebrities and raw-eyed women intuit ""the authenticity that all kitsch dimly remembers."" His rare reprovals carry a giddy weight: ""A lot of people need Lucian Freud to be a great artist. How else to explain the furor for the pretty good English portrait and figure painter?"" He doesn't dodge psychology; in Jackson Pollock's drip paintings, Schjeldahl writes, the volatile artist found ""a steadying and dispassionate, heaven-sent collaborator: gravity."" If you don't care about visual art (my own ignorance of opera, which I offer as ballast, is humiliatingly total), these observations may not feel significant to you. Alone, they would mark him merely as our best critic.

But what separates Schjeldahl is the tangible sense in nearly every piece in this book -- say 85 of the 100 -- that something existential is at stake as he writes. The same sensation is present in Barthes and Sontag, his closest analogues to my mind, writers who, whatever their subject at a given moment, are desperately attempting to make something lucid out of this indecipherable life they've received without asking for it. Schjeldahl seems to find in art the unmediated experiences of living -- humor, anger, sadness, perplexity, beauty, sex. He is especially moving when moved, himself, to reverence. Of arguably his favorite artist, Velazquez (as if ""the flame painted the pictures"" of the fire), he ends his review in simple wonder: ""One of us did that."" Like all compilations, ""Hot, Cold, Heavy, Light"" is jerry-built. You could wish that it addressed more passionately the transformation of the art market into a venue for arbitrage; on the other hand, you could note that Schjeldahl was vitally open-eyed to female artists before such inclusiveness drew applause, dazzling on Ree Morton, Helen Levitt, Jenny Holzer, Florine Stettheimer and others. But perhaps none of those names means a thing to you. If so, do me a favor. Go online and look up Philip Guston. Spend one minute with his ugly, mesmerizing, pink-scrimmed paintings. Now watch, as Schjeldahl captures their essence in eight words: ""scenarios of childish fear shading into middle-aged abjection."" An artist, his yearnings and the work they produced are all joined in that lightning bolt of a line. Perhaps even a century -- the 20th. I know that art is only a small part of living, but it's also true that there are people whose makeshift faith lies in the best things human beings have made. Schjeldahl grants those artifacts a corresponding dignity, with all the meaning we knew they had but could not describe ourselves. It's astonishing; it astonishes. One of us did that.","""Hot, Cold, Heavy, Light,"" a new collection by Peter Schjeldahl, includes 100 reviews from the past 30 years, capturing his talent for distilling the essence of an artist's work in a single line.",486f58d5-0f88-56b1-8d56-3943ea8a00cb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/06/02/books/review/31Finch-promo/31Finch-promo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1d7c49dbb54f48bc87f1d7160431fe3f478c86225dc5e726b2b35f7aa325b256&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The art critic Peter Schjeldahl.,486f58d5-0f88-56b1-8d56-3943ea8a00cb,N24News/imgs/486f58d5-0f88-56b1-8d56-3943ea8a00cb.jpg,13

Sports,"At the Miami Open, It's Ashleigh Barty's Turn for a Title",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/sports/ashleigh-barty-miami-open.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. -- Another week on the 2019 tennis circuit, another different champion. April is just about here, and no man or woman has yet managed to win more than one singles title on the main circuit this season. ""That's amazing, isn't it?"" Ashleigh Barty said after keeping the streak alive on Saturday with a 7-6 (1), 6-3 victory against Karolina Pliskova in the Miami Open final. But though Barty, an Australian, was the 14th WTA champion in 14 events, her winning a title of this magnitude bore no resemblance to a fluke. Her game is a varied thing of beauty, mate, and though at 5 feet 5 inches she is far from the most imposing player on tour, her tennis has been standing taller and taller in 2019.

She was a finalist in Sydney, a quarterfinalist at the Australian Open with many of her sports-savvy compatriots piling on the pressure by tracking her every stroke. She was then the key figure in Australia's 3-2 victory over the United States on the road in the Fed Cup. Though Elina Svitolina stopped her in the round of 16 at Indian Wells by winning the longest match of the women's season (3 hours 12 minutes), there was no stopping Barty in Miami. There was no stopping Bob and Mike Bryan either. The twins, who have formed one of the greatest doubles teams in tennis history and will turn 41 on April 29, defended their men's doubles title with a 7-5, 7-6 (6) victory over Wesley Koolhof and Stefanos Tsitsipas. The title came eight months after Bob Bryan underwent hip resurfacing surgery on Aug. 2, 2018. He believed then that his playing career was over, but they have now won two titles since reuniting this season. The first came at the Delray Beach Open last month, but Saturday's victory was a step up, coming after they saved four match points in the semifinals against Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo. ""If you would have told me in August when I was getting surgery that I was going to defend the Miami Open title I would have said you are full of it, really,"" Bob Bryan said.

Barty, seeded No. 12, defeated three top-10 players: Kiki Bertens; Petra Kvitova, who had stopped her runs in Australia; and Pliskova. Already an established doubles champion, Barty will be a part of the singles top 10 for the first time on Monday, moving to No. 9 and becoming the first Australian woman to break into that group since 2013, when Samantha Stosur was at her peak. But Barty, now 22, is the undisputed leader of Australian women's tennis at this stage, as underscored by her 6-0, 6-3 victory over the 35-year-old Stosur in the round of 32 in Miami.

Her Australian roots go deeper than most: Her father, Robert, is an Indigenous Australian, a part of the Ngarigo people. She has embraced that heritage, taking on a role as a tennis ambassador in the indigenous community, joining the former champion Evonne Goolagong Cawley, who was a part of the Wiradjuri people and who won seven Grand Slam singles titles from 1971 to 1980. Barty is, in many respects, an old-school tennis talent. Her off-court demeanor is upbeat, articulate and modest. (She favors ""we"" and ""team"" more than ""I"" when discussing her rise.) Her on-court demeanor is understated, close to stoic. There was barely a grunt and nary a shriek as she and Pliskova exchanged blows on the temporary main court that has been installed this year in Hard Rock Stadium.

Even if there had been more shouts and murmurs, it would have been a challenge to make them out given the poor acoustics that muffle noise even when a crowd is much bigger and more boisterous than it was for Saturday's final. But it is Barty's tennis that is the true classic. She has pure technique, including a potent loop topspin forehand and a powerful, match-winning serve full of disguise and power, which she generates with great leg drive and racket-head speed. Pliskova, a former No. 1 who was seeded No. 5 in Miami, leads the tour in aces. But Barty won that duel within a duel, finishing with 15 aces to Pliskova's six and winning 86 percent of her first-serve points to Pliskova's 66 percent. Barty can also thrive at the net (she won the United States Open doubles title last year with CoCo Vandeweghe) and can drive a two-handed backhand or hit a one-handed slice with enough bite to cause a world of geometric pain for tall players, like the 6-1 Pliskova, who thrive on higher strike zones and consistent pace. Variety, it seems, is all the rage in women's tennis. Bianca Andreescu, the 18-year-old Canadian wild card who made a stunning run to the title at Indian Wells, also has a diverse array of weaponry and, like Barty, a pronounced midrally taste for changing rhythm. ""I have always tried to bring as much variety onto the court as possible,"" Barty said. ""It's always about trying to neutralize what your opponent's doing. Obviously, there was a bit of a phase in women's tennis where there was this big power and first strikers that were getting on top of rallies early. But I think the physicality in tennis, especially on the women's side, has grown, which has allowed more players to neutralize off that big first ball and work their way into points."" She proved her point repeatedly on Saturday, displaying her improved returns and tracking down Pliskova's flat bolts in the corners and slicing them back into play. But she has ample punching power of her own and quite an upside. It is easy to see her thriving on clay (see the French Open) and grass (see Wimbledon).

It is also easy to imagine that this breakthrough could have come earlier if she had not decided to step away from tennis after the 2014 United States Open and focus on cricket instead. But in her view, it was that break, which ended in 2016, that has allowed her to better manage the expectations and begin fulfilling her tennis potential. ""I think I was an average cricketer, and I'm becoming a better tennis player,"" she said. ""It was certainly an enjoyable time in my life. It was a time that I think I found myself a little bit more as a person, and I met an amazing group of girls and a new circle of friends, I suppose. But I think tennis was always my calling."" So it seems after the most significant victory of her career: The Miami Open is a part of the top tier of events on the regular tour, below only the four Grand Slam tournaments and the season-ending WTA Finals in prestige. Barty might be merely one of so many tennis winners in 2019, but she has the ability and the personality to not only be a serial champion but a popular one, as well.","The Australian beat Karolina Pliskova for her most significant victory, showing the promise of many more. She also became the 14th different WTA champion this year in 14 events.",e78dabde-f4c0-51ea-8059-72b7eb6b7aea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/31/sports/31Tennis-print/merlin_152836863_2c64d751-5106-4338-a6dc-5fe59f180d35-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5dad3a7d336a2bc22310d57abdd9e5c0e5ca5ab23b24aaad205e654f74e1fa1d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Australian Ashleigh Barty has taken her tennis career to an elite level despite once quitting the sport.,e78dabde-f4c0-51ea-8059-72b7eb6b7aea,N24News/imgs/e78dabde-f4c0-51ea-8059-72b7eb6b7aea.jpg,9

Food,Craving an Easy Shrimp Dinner? Make This Curry,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/15/dining/shrimp-curry-recipe.html,"For me, every meal begins at the market -- in this case, the fish market. The routine is always the same: Check what's on display, find the most fetching option and consider guests' tastes (and the contents of my wallet). Take the plunge.

On a recent trip, I saw many attractive possibilities, but it was the wild Georgia shrimp, still in the shell, that caught my eye. With a little ingenuity, a pound of these beauties could feed a table of four. But, the question was, how?

It would be easiest to toss them, unshelled, into a pot of boiling water, seasoned with plenty of salt and aromatics, then serve them with melted butter or a mayonnaise-based sauce for dipping, some crusty French bread or a few boiled potatoes. Peeling the shrimp at the table would be part of the evening's entertainment.","Sweet-sour tamarind paste, coconut milk and stir-fried mushrooms enhance this quick shellfish dish.",5904995d-feb7-5a8b-99fe-c3b2c3f0d45c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/20/dining/20kitchen1/20kitchen1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=eb2811c65b8f9c1273adb84d4dc2c466247468b8ad7561784083a2938cc265c3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Shrimp and mushrooms play the central role in this spiced weeknight curry.,5904995d-feb7-5a8b-99fe-c3b2c3f0d45c,N24News/imgs/5904995d-feb7-5a8b-99fe-c3b2c3f0d45c.jpg,17
Travel,Partying in South Beach Like It's $19.99,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/23/travel/south-beach-miami-nightlife-clubs-frugal-budget.html,"They had turned out the regular overhead lights at the Pearl Champagne Lounge, and now there was just black light, which lent an eerie fluorescence to the clubgoers' white T-shirts and teeth, and the occasional glow stick. The bass-heavy thump was shaking the walls of the club, but the room was so packed it was difficult to dance. Unable to move their legs, dancers resorted to simply pointing to the ceiling in time to the music (""Do you want to get wasted, wasted""). At one point a huge, muscled gentleman pulled out a full-size trombone -- if he didn't work there, I'm not sure how he got that thing past security -- and began playing along to the music. This was not exactly my scene. I love going out and dancing, but my days of wearing glow paint and getting ""wasted, wasted"" are in the distant past. Nevertheless, I was in South Beach, a neighborhood of Miami Beach known for being one of the night life capitals of the nation, and I was sure I would find something to my taste. I knew going in that South Beach is expensive and fairly touristy and has long since been surpassed in hip-factor by neighborhoods like Wynwood and Edgewater. But its glamorous history, legendary Art Deco buildings and weekend party scene along Ocean Drive continue to draw visitors from all over the world. And it presented me with a challenge: whether I could ""do"" the notoriously expensive South Beach on my frugal budget.

Collins and Washington Avenues serve as the main traffic arteries on the east side of South Beach, but Ocean Drive, which is closest to the beach, is where most of the action is. Don't try to drive (or call a taxi or rideshare) on Ocean on weekend nights, by the way -- traffic is bumper to bumper. I headed to the Palace Bar, on the corner of Ocean and 12th Street, a popular club and restaurant known for its weekend sidewalk drag queen shows. When I arrived, a mixed crowd of men and women were eating and drinking while two topless young men gyrated for tips. The activity inside the Palace spills out onto the sidewalk, where there are covered tables that provide some shelter from Miami's frequent flash rainstorms. That's how I ended up at the Palace in the first place -- I was seeking refuge when it suddenly started to pour (not the first or last time this would happen during my trip, though this was before Hurricane Matthew battered Florida). There's an interesting mixed reaction to the rain in South Beach: Some people run for cover; many others, who are wearing very little clothing to begin with, seem completely unbothered. I was one of the former and stumbled upon the Palace right when it happened to be starting one of its famous drag shows. A beautiful, statuesque drag queen in full hair and makeup stood on the sidewalk, eyes closed, in deep concentration. Palace security cleared the sidewalk in front of the restaurant, making the pavement into a long runway. The music began, and the drag queen started to dance and strut up and down the length of the sidewalk, lip-syncing a Beyonce song while onlookers waved dollar bills. At the end, the sidewalk audience burst into applause and the drag queen, who was also the M.C. for the rest of the evening, took the microphone. ""Thank you so much,"" she said breathlessly. ""Please stick around for more homosexuality after the break.""

The show at the Palace was free, but I wouldn't get away with paying so little during my entire trip. Just down the street from the Palace was Mango's Tropical Cafe, one of the better-known nightspots in South Beach. It's known for its scantily clad dancers (male and female), long lines to get in, and Latin music that pumps until the early morning hours. I went in after 2 a.m., hoping to avoid paying the cover: no such luck. I forked over $20 and made my way into the sprawling club. A group of young women in sequined outfits was doing a choreographed dance on the bar near the V.I.P. area. Hundreds of people were packed inside: dancing, talking, drinking, making out, trying to push through to another area of the bar, or on their phones. The main dance floor area, toward the back, was so full it was almost impossible to move. The upstairs area was more chilled out, and had rooms off the main thoroughfare that were like clubs-within-a-club and offered different types of music; one was hip-hop, one was more lounge-y. I passed on the drinks (a Corona was $10) as I had paid so much for the cover, but I was glad I had come: When you think about the quintessential clubbing experience, Mango's is what comes to mind.

I did indulge down the street, however, at a popular hotel called the Clevelander, where the party space is outdoors -- something that I imagine works both for and against it. Because of the periodic rainstorms, the crowd at the Clevelander was pretty thin -- no line, no cover. Once inside, I found a dedicated clubbing crowd bouncing up and down to a D.J. I went to the bar and got something called a ""Frozen SoBe"" (""SoBe"" being ""South Beach"") that tasted like sickeningly tart alcoholic lemonade. It should be noted that tax and a 20 percent gratuity are typically automatically added to your drink tab in these South Beach clubs -- my $12 frozen lemonade was actually $15.75. (One bartender said the automatic tip was added because of the number of foreign tourists in South Beach.) The Clevelander is also one of hundreds of Art Deco buildings in South Beach, best appreciated during the day. Ocean Drive north of Fifth Street and Collins Avenue around 17th Street are particularly good areas for walking around and enjoying the wonderfully preserved structures. The Miami Design Preservation League, with a visitors' center on Ocean Drive, conducts tours and fights to protect the architectural integrity of the area. Mac's Club Deuce, a cash-only dive that bills itself as the oldest bar in Miami, is not one of those curated architectural gems, and I love it all the more because of it. With $1 pool and a jukebox blasting songs that took me back to high school (Green Day, Collective Soul), it was exactly what I needed to balance out those packed rooms of sweaty clubgoers. I had a Miller Lite for $5 -- the cheapest drink in South Beach I would find -- and enjoyed the respite from throbbing bass. Still, there were club scenes I enjoyed. One of my favorite locations, in fact, was a small club called Do Not Sit on the Furniture, an intimate space on 16th Street known for its cozy confines and good D.J.s. A headliner known simply as Mira was spinning that night, and I pondered whether to purchase tickets in advance on the Resident Advisor site, which promotes electronic music events and sells tickets, or to just show up at the door and see if I could get in. I decided to wait and approached the entrance, a small gate between an apartment building and a seemingly deserted retail showroom. I had my wallet out, prepared to inquire if there was a cover. Instead I just asked the bouncer if I could go in. ""Sure,"" he responded. ""Just need to see some ID,"" and ushered me in. Sometimes, you just have to ask.

Once inside, I walked past Mira's D.J. booth to the dance floor littered with a few cigarette butts and a couple dozen people moving to the music. The sound system was very good -- an underappreciated aspect of many clubs. It was loud enough and the bass full enough to rattle your very bones, but it didn't hurt your ears. Since it was after 4 a.m., I skipped the alcohol, opting for a bottle of water and a soda for $10. Given the bar's name, it wasn't a surprise that no one was sitting, but rather dancing to Mira's excellent set. The music pounded into the night and, at a little after 5:30 a.m., things wrapped up. The lights went on, the disco ball stopped and those of us still dancing began dazedly applauding. Mira seemed surprised and slightly touched by this as she acknowledged our applause. And one by one we tumbled back out into the street, the sky dark but with a faint penumbral glow of coming morning.",The bars and clubs of South Beach are notoriously expensive.

Media,"Perspective, Not Parody, at a Subdued Correspondents' Dinner",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/28/business/media/white-house-correspondents-dinner-ron-chernow.html,"""Campaigns against the press don't get your face carved into the rocks of Mount Rushmore,"" Ron Chernow said on Saturday, ""for when you chip away at the press, you chip away at our democracy.""

WASHINGTON -- Ron Chernow has won a Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award. His biography of Alexander Hamilton inspired a musical that revolutionized Broadway. As the featured speaker at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner on Saturday, Mr. Chernow had the not particularly pleasant task of keynoting an event under siege from a president who relentlessly attacks the press and from critics who question its purpose. In choosing a scholar over a satirist, the Correspondents' Association had sought to solemnize a dinner known for its comedic puncturing of the Washington bubble. Michelle Wolf's routine last year scandalized many of the solons in the room and prompted some journalists to call for a formal apology. At an after-party, reporters expressed sympathy to the press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, who had declined to be photographed with the comedian after her set. If losing the punch lines was meant as an enticement to President Trump, the move fell short: He skipped out for the third year running. Ms. Sanders demurred, too, appearing with Mr. Trump at a rally in Wisconsin. ""Last year this night I was at a slightly different event,"" she told a crowd that shouted anti-media chants. ""Not quite the best welcome.""

In an added slight, Mr. Trump decreed last week that members of his administration should not attend, prompting news organizations to scramble to fill seats that had been set aside for cabinet secretaries and White House aides. But for those lamenting the vitriol of recent years -- ""this surreal interlude in American life,"" as Mr. Chernow put it -- the historian offered a palliative in the form of perspective. Partisan attacks, he noted in a half-hour speech, flourished in the days of the Founding Fathers. Laws were passed against free expression. Presidents, from George Washington on, fumed about journalists. A century ago, the showman Will Rogers noted that ""people are taking their comedians seriously and their politicians as a joke."" It's fair to say the president, famously skewered by Seth Meyers and Barack Obama at the dinner's 2011 edition, may not have enjoyed himself this year, either. Mr. Chernow roasted Mr. Trump in his own wry way. ""Washington committed only one major blunder as president: He failed to put his name on Mount Vernon and thereby bungled an early opportunity at branding,"" the historian said, mocking Mr. Trump's reported remarks during a tour of the first president's Virginia home. ""Clearly deficient in the art of the deal, the poor man had to settle for the lowly title of father of his country. A very sad story.""

Mr. Chernow described Hamilton as ""an immigrant who arrived, thank God, before the country was full."" He noted that John Adams, who took steps to outlaw criticism of the government, failed to earn a second term. ""Campaigns against the press don't get your face carved into the rocks of Mount Rushmore,"" he said, ""for when you chip away at the press, you chip away at our democracy."" He concluded his remarks by saying: ""Politicians and diapers must be changed often, and for the same reason."" (Mr. Chernow attributed the quote to Mark Twain, though its origins are murky.)
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. A year ago, Matt Schlapp, the chairman of the American Conservative Union, stormed out in the middle of Ms. Wolf's raucous set. On Saturday, he stuck around to the end, though he stopped short of endorsing Mr. Chernow's remarks. ""I had a lot of college professors who said the same thing,"" Mr. Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes, is a top White House adviser, said as he left the Hilton ballroom. Another Trump associate in attendance gave better marks. ""It was perfectly spot-on for the time and for where we are in the world,"" Gary Cohn, the president's former chief economic adviser, said afterward. ""It sort of hit the spot."" The writer and director Judd Apatow defended Ms. Wolf last year. But on Sunday, he praised Mr. Chernow's performance as ""a refreshing new approach."" ""On the surface, one might think it is a safe choice, a retreat,"" Mr. Apatow wrote in an email. ""But having someone who actually reads and understands the lessons of history, as opposed to our president, makes a very strong, even aggressive statement about the dangers of having a president with no grasp of history or the true spirit of our country."" Once a high point of the Washington social calendar, the dinner has lost some of its glamour since Mr. Trump came to town. Hollywood agencies still threw parties the night before, but the big celebrity attraction this year was the actor Michael Kelly, who played Doug Stamper on the now-canceled political drama ""House of Cards."" Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, showed up to an event with a camera crew from ""Extra,"" his current employer. At a charity brunch on Saturday hosted by the Washington doyenne Tammy Haddad, Jay Leno was the featured guest -- and even he seemed unimpressed. ""We've pretty much reached the bottom of the barrel here,"" the former ""Tonight Show"" host quipped of his appearance. Mr. Leno's next joke, which compared the event's ""spring garden"" dress code to a feminine hygiene product, did not exactly kill.

Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, also made the rounds. Appearing freshly spray-tanned as he kicked back on Friday in the V.I.P. area of the National Portrait Gallery, where The Hill hosted a reception, he said he was exempt from the president's boycott because he did not work in the West Wing. How about Mr. Chernow as this year's speaker? ""I'd rather have a comedian!"" Mr. Giuliani said. The chummy nature of the dinner, where reporters mingle with their sources, has long attracted criticism. (The New York Times stopped attending in 2008.) Its recent diminishment is the rare development of the Trump era that has delighted the president's fans and high-minded media critics alike. This year's attendees especially welcomed Mr. Chernow's reminiscences of happier times in the dinner's history, when, he said, ""our best presidents have handled the press with wit, grace, charm, candor, and even humor."" The dinner is held at the hotel where, in 1981, Ronald Reagan was shot. Reagan, Mr. Chernow noted, dialed into the festivities a few days later from his hospital bed, telling the reporters, ""If I could give you just one little bit of advice: When someone tells you to get into a car quick, do it."" ""That was a touch of class that has been sorely missing in our political culture in recent years,"" Mr. Chernow said, to applause. ""It was a subtle reminder that whether Republicans or Democrats, we are all bona fide members of Team U.S.A., and not members of enemy camps."" Around the time that the historian was speaking on Saturday, an alternative universe of sorts unfolded across town. At a concert hall near the White House, Bill and Hillary Clinton appeared for the latest stop on their national speaking tour, with the comedian Jordan Klepper on hand to introduce them. ""You are in the only room tonight in D.C.,"" Mr. Klepper told the audience, ""that has the guts to put a president and comedian on the same stage."" A few thousands votes in the other direction in 2016, and it might have been Mrs. Clinton onstage at the night's more prominent event, with Mr. Klepper cracking wise at the lectern. By Sunday morning, Twitter was abuzz with a video of Mr. Klepper persuading Mrs. Clinton to read aloud portions of the special counsel's report.

Theater,Has Alanis Morissette Made the Most Woke Musical Since 'Hair'?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/theater/alanis-morissette-jagged-little-pill-musical.html,"Alanis Morissette and the director Diane Paulus at a rehearsal of ""Jagged Little Pill.""Credit...Matt Cosby for The New York Times



CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Everyone seems to have a story about hearing Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill"" for the first time. The writer Diablo Cody was listening to the radio when a D.J. said, ""This is going to be huge."" The composer Tom Kitt was in college, feeling like the whole world had stopped. I was a kid who got grounded for accidentally saying the F-word while singing along to ""You Oughta Know."" The album's parade of fearlessly raw hits was as integral to '90s pop culture as AOL promo disks and Doc Martens. Its success vindicated Ms. Morissette, who was previously rejected by radio stations saying they didn't need another woman after Sinead O'Connor and Tori Amos. ""For those in the patriarchy who thought women were not bankable,"" she recalled in a recent interview, ""that went out the window."" Now Ms. Morissette's trailblazing 1995 album is taking on new life: as theater. And don't expect a fun, nostalgic jukebox musical about the '90s. ""Jagged Little Pill,"" which opens at the American Repertory Theater here on May 24, is very much of the present and may just be the most woke musical since ""Hair.""

""Alanis's songs were written 23 years ago,"" said Mr. Kitt, the production's music supervisor and the composer of the Pulitzer Prize-winning musical ""Next to Normal."" ""But they feel like they were written yesterday. These are all human issues that we've been dealing with for years."" To pull off what may risk coming off as heavy-handed, American Repertory has assembled a team of A-list collaborators in addition to Mr. Kitt and Ms. Morissette: the Tony Award-winning Diane Paulus, the company's artistic director; the choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui; and Ms. Cody, the screenwriter of ""Juno"" fame,"" who wrote the book. (The unsung hero, they all said, is Lily, a French bulldog puppy that has become the production's de facto therapy dog.) ""When you're dealing with an album that has such meaning for people, you have to respect that,"" Ms. Paulus said. ""We know people are going to expect some sonic universe and emotion. But if we do our job right, people are going to think: I've never heard these songs like this."" The songs, which also include Morissette tracks outside ""Jagged Little Pill,"" are convincingly theatrical in the context of the musical, which may be a surprise considering the material comes from two outsiders; Ms. Cody didn't even take an academic stab at dramatic writing while growing up, she said.

""I don't think I ever had the confidence in my younger years to say I could tell a story on the stage,"" she said. ""I was never an assured creator. I didn't think I had anything to contribute."" But Ms. Cody's book for ""Jagged Little Pill"" -- which strips away the picture-perfect veneer of a Connecticut family over the course of a year -- is unapologetically on brand: by turns bitingly satirical, touching and frank. In fact, it may even be a more honest reflection of her writerly mind than we typically get onscreen. ""I come from a world of parent companies and advertisers and suits and caution,"" she said. ""If I want to express a belief of my own, I'm asked to temper it so that we don't alienate anyone. This is the opposite."" If there is anything keeping Ms. Cody's book in check, it's the music itself. But part of her task has been to twist the poetic ambiguity of Ms. Morissette's lyrics in the service of an original story. That means framing ""Mary Jane"" as a husband's whisper over his wife's hospital bed, or ""One Hand in My Pocket"" as musical theater's prototypical ""I want"" song. But sometimes the production leaves Ms. Morissette's cherished music alone: The staging for ""You Oughta Know,"" sung by the scene-stealing Lauren Patten, is so spare it could just as easily be an intimate concert. (At the performance I attended last week, Ms. Patten's ""You Oughta Know"" stopped the show with a minutes-long standing ovation. I was told that this has been happening every night since previews began on May 5.)

""Ironic"" is sung in the context of a high school writing workshop and the scene makes a joke from the elephant in the room: decades of pedants nit-picking the song's misuse of the word ""ironic."" ""I'm probably laughing the hardest in the audience,"" Ms. Morissette said, adding that when she worked on the song with the songwriter and producer Glen Ballard, ""we didn't give a [expletive] about the malapropism."" She also didn't think many people would even hear it. But once ""Ironic"" became a hit, there were entire website forums dedicated to shaming the song and -- in true internet fashion -- thinking of ways to murder Ms. Morissette. ""I naively thought fame would be me kumbaya-ing with Johnny Depp lying on my lap at a campfire and Sharon Stone offering me a drink,"" she said. ""It was the complete opposite, totally isolating. I just stopped reading any comments."" The vibe behind the scenes of the musical is, like its material, inclusive and socially aware. Early in the rehearsal process Ms. Paulus asked everyone in the cast to give a presentation on a topic from the show. Celia Gooding (the daughter of the current Tony nominee LaChanze) -- who plays the queer, protest sign-toting daughter Frankie -- spoke about colorism, a form of discrimination based on skin color that transcends race. And Elizabeth Stanley (""On the Town""), who plays her mother, chose to research transracial adoption. ""Everyone shared really vulnerable personal stories,"" Ms. Stanley said. ""It forced us as a company to be gentle with each other.""

Members of the cast and crew have also been one another's shoulder to lean on amid what Ms. Paulus called ""the last two years of major trauma in America,"" which shaped ""Jagged Little Pill"" throughout development. Some material has even gone straight from headlines to the stage, like a sobering moment in ""All I Really Want"" when the song suddenly stops -- leaving the audience with the tableau of Frankie holding up a #NeverAgain against a backdrop of images from the Parkland student protests. Ms. Paulus's inspiration for moments like this is ""Hair,"" which she directed for Shakespeare in the Park, and later Broadway, nearly a decade ago. ""They were reflecting in real time what was happening in the world,"" she said of that show's original production, in 1967. ""Guys were getting their draft cards delivered to the stage door; it was that real."" With that in mind, the version of ""Jagged Little Pill"" I saw could change tomorrow. It could even be a different show if it were staged on Broadway, as many of her American Repertory productions are. ""I feel like theater is all about the present,"" Ms. Paulus said. ""When and if we get another shot at this in the future, I'm sure things will change."" But, she was quick to emphasize, any revisions based on current events would have to take their lead from Ms. Morissette's music and lyrics -- which, she added, actually provide a hopeful outlook in the age of bleak push notifications. ""The pain and anger of my songs are all on this spectrum,"" Ms. Morissette said. ""The darker the song is, the more that hope is just this pilot light that was there the whole time.""","The stage version of ""Jagged Little Pill"" sets a story steeped in hot-button issues like opiate addiction and gender identity to the singer's raw 1995 album.",076a3674-8987-564f-a268-55a37245092a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/20/arts/20JAGGEDl/20JAGGEDl-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=2ac1b324a5fedd067c4705fae7cc43f76fb8f0fa18d8104c184926b003767935&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Alanis Morissette and the director Diane Paulus at a rehearsal of &ldquo;Jagged Little Pill.&rdquo;,076a3674-8987-564f-a268-55a37245092a,N24News/imgs/076a3674-8987-564f-a268-55a37245092a.jpg,10
Style,Michiel Huisman Isn't Spooked by Table Tennis,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/12/style/michiel-huisman-isnt-spooked-by-table-tennis.html,"The Dutch actor Michiel Huisman doesn't believe in ghosts, but he does worship Ping-Pong. On a recent Thursday afternoon, Mr. Huisman had tip-tapped down a steep flight of stairs on East 23rd Street and into Spin New York, a neon-lit basement Ping-Pong palace with a view of the downtown 6 train. It's around the corner from the apartment he shares with his wife, the actress Tara Elder, and their 11-year-old daughter. Mr. Huisman, who played the Daario Naharis in ""Game of Thrones"" and is now starring as a ghost skeptic in ""The Haunting of Hill House"" on Netflix, has been playing table tennis since he was a child. He carries his own paddle and he displayed it proudly, a Donic Appelgren Allplay faced in red and black rubber. Last summer he joined a Ping-Pong club near his home in the Netherlands, and he played every Monday. ""I think I won one game,"" he said. ""It gave me a lot of hope."" Dressed in a blinding white T-shirt and black jeans, with a gold chain around his neck appropriated from his wife, he'd come to Spin during walk-in hours hoping for a pickup game. No one seemed to want to play with him. (Starring in a hit show comes with a few privileges; this isn't one of them.)

He approached two men who had finished a close match, but they turned him down, saying they had to get back to the office. He was left alone, idly toying with one of Spin's orange balls, a tiny plastic tangerine. ""It's very bouncy,"" he said, slightly forlorn. Finally, one of the in-house pros, Matt Suchy, took pity on Mr. Huisman and offered an impromptu lesson.

They warmed up, and Mr. Suchy was immediately impressed. ""Your serve is so nasty!"" Mr. Suchy said. But Mr. Huisman struggled to keep the point in play. The problem? The paddle. Mr. Suchy took the Donic from him and showed him how the worn rubber had lost its traction -- a smooth surface makes spin difficult -- and had even begun to peel away from the wood. A kind of horror dawned. ""It's been holding me back for so long,"" Mr. Huisman said. ""Years maybe."" This is the kind of horror Mr. Huisman accepts. Steve, the character he plays in ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" is a vigorous ghost denier and Mr. Huisman isn't so different, though he did admit that once, on a night shoot in England in his early 20s, he became so terrified by a dark and yawning bathroom that he couldn't unzip and sprinted back to set.

A practical person and mostly unspookable, Mr. Huisman said he was never really frightened during the eight months it took to shoot the 10 episodes. The worst shock he received was when he walked into the makeup trailer one morning and saw one of the ghost characters sitting in his chair. ""Some of the special-effects makeup was really intense,"" he said. But that was as bad as it got. ""I don't want to burst the bubble too much, but generally it wasn't as scary as watching the show,"" Mr. Huisman said. Apparently, he doesn't think that watching the show is so scary either. He let his daughter see it, and sometimes he forgot to tell her when to cover her eyes. (""Is that really weird that she watched it?"" he asked.) He gestured toward Mr. Suchy, prepping up for another go-round. ""This is scary,"" Mr. Huisman said. Mr. Suchy gave him one of his own paddles, a Tenergy the size of a salad plate. ""Immediately the ball has lift and spin,"" Mr. Huisman said, marveling. Mr. Suchy used a smaller paddle, the size of an oatmeal cookie. The first few points were close, but Mr. Suchy pulled away and won 11 to 7. They hugged it out. ""You have no backhand,"" Mr. Suchy said. He adjusted Mr. Huisman's grip, asking him to use only one finger on the back of the paddle. Mr. Suchy gave him a few more tips, because if Mr. Huisman is often a subtle actor, he is not a subtle player.","The Dutch actor, star of ""The Haunting of Hill House,"" has a wicked serve but his backhand needs some tweaks.",dd8c5067-f1b4-5d83-8045-e419da8c7011,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/11/fashion/08encounters-huisman3/08encounters-huisman3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=ae5d46d13d9196a111662dbd66bb8129811fa6748cb419cdb4df7cc1f29cbe88&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michiel Huisman, right, got some Ping-Pong tips from Matt Suchy at Spin New York.",dd8c5067-f1b4-5d83-8045-e419da8c7011,N24News/imgs/dd8c5067-f1b4-5d83-8045-e419da8c7011.jpg,15
Travel,"At the Whitby in New York, Warm Service, Sophisticated Design",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/24/travel/whitby-hotel-new-york-review.html,"The Whitby Hotel, a property with a serious design personality, opened in February 2017 in midtown Manhattan, part of London-based Firmdale Hotels, a brand with eight properties in London and one other in New York City. Firmdale's first New York property, Crosby Street Hotel, in Soho, opened in 2009 and is considered to be among the city's most fashionable accommodations. The company's co-owner and design director, Kit Kemp, has a flair for creating unique hotels, and the Whitby, too, is a place with serious design personality: each of the 86 rooms is individually decorated, and original art by contemporary artists from around the world adorns both guest rooms and public spaces. The Whitby is on 56th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues. Trump Tower, a popular tourist spot ever since Donald J. Trump was elected as the president, is steps away. While this may deter some overnight guests because of the crowds snapping pictures, the property's central location is undoubtedly appealing: attractions such as Rockefeller Center, Central Park, the Museum of Modern Art, top restaurants and the stores on Fifth Avenue are all within walking distance. Taxis are readily available, and several subways are within a 10-minute walk including the N, R, F and E lines.

My 350-square-foot room felt like being in a guest room in the home of a friend whose design style I admire. The colorful, contemporary space had black fabric walls, a textured pink and beige rug, a long wooden desk with an upholstered lime green chair and a small sitting area with two orange patterned chairs. And could I please buy the luxuriously comfortable king-size bed with a high headboard upholstered in orange for my bedroom at home? The nine-foot high ceilings made the room feel larger than it was, and because the property wasn't full, the personable front desk employee had upgraded me one level upon check-in from the entry level superior category to the luxury category; the Whitby has nine categories of rooms, all with 55-inch flat screen televisions.

The Whitby's chic but approachable design sensibility extended to the generously sized bathroom. With its black and white gleaming marble walls and floors, it was modern, but the two free-standing white ceramic sinks brought in an old-fashioned feel (there was a shower but no tub). Instead of the generic white robes common at many hogh-end hotels, the pair here had elegant blue piping, and I loved the heavenly lavender eucalyptus scent in the Rik Rak by Kit Kemp toiletries. The Whitby Bar & Restaurant , an all-day spot that offers breakfast, brunch, lunch, afternoon tea, dinner and cocktails; a small but well-equipped gym; a 130-seat movie theater with screenings on Sunday afternoons, open to both guests and the general public (guests can attend for free; tickets for non-guests are $15); and a small drawing room with an honesty bar where guests can pour themselves a drink and request that it be charged to their room.

The restaurant is especially lively at breakfast and during afternoon tea, available in both a traditional style with finger sandwiches and scones as well as in a healthy version with dishes such as a roasted beet and melon taco and an avocado and green chickpea crostini ( the tea is a pricey $54 a person ). I enjoyed a tasty and satisfying breakfast at the restaurant of house-made gluten-free granola, yogurt, mixed berries, nuts and lemonade (breakfast is $30 a person). Room service is also an option, and with rooms so stylish, ordering in is a tempting choice. With its central location, warm service and sophisticated but homey feel, the Whitby stands out in a city where travelers are spoiled for choice when it comes to upscale accommodations.","The hotel has a distinctive look, a personable staff and a lively afternoon tea.",18944a7d-3cd8-5282-a5c5-e165c1a26f87,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/18/travel/18checkin-newyork-1/18checkin-newyork-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a69173f1d9e2ed419deea8c6d8da7b1f8d069497a328a2db233d5b34193a5a4b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The lobby at the Whitby Hotel in New York City.,18944a7d-3cd8-5282-a5c5-e165c1a26f87,N24News/imgs/18944a7d-3cd8-5282-a5c5-e165c1a26f87.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,"50 So-So Dates Later, a Breakup Gets Unbroken",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/11/fashion/weddings/50-so-so-dates-later-a-breakup-gets-unbroken.html,"Denise K. Shull tries to help bankers, competitive athletes and other clients improve their performance by getting in closer touch with their feelings. As the founder of the ReThink Group, a consultancy in Manhattan, she advises traders and portfolios managers to analyze their fluctuating emotions, and even their childhoods, as carefully as they do the markets. ""Casual conversation doesn't really exist with Denise,"" said Craig Keslar, who has known her since she was the head cheerleader in high school. ""It gets real deep pretty quick and that's the fun of being around her.""

Ms. Shull, who is 58, married her high school sweetheart in her 20s; got a job as a systems engineer at IBM; divorced; moved to Aspen, Colo., to ski; and then earned a master's degree in neuroscience at the University of Chicago. She planned to become a therapist, but became an equities trader instead. By 2001, though, she was living in Manhattan and recovering from a broken heart. ""I had been dating somebody who broke up with me and vanished,"" she said. Afterward, she struggled to meet new people. ""I remember her complaining that on the Upper West Side, it was all strollers and dogs,"" Ms. Smith said. Ms. Shull joined Social Circles, a now-defunct networking company, and signed up for a group golf outing in July 2002. Each golf cart held two people and everyone scrambled for a partner. To Ms. Shull's surprise, a slim economist, William T. Long, appeared by her side. ""She seemed very confidant and very vivacious, very noticeable,"" Mr. Long said. ""I made a point of trying to get in the same golf cart as her.""

He met her three main requirements in a boyfriend. He had a graduate degree (a master's in economics from Duke). He was in therapy. (""You gotta know yourself or you don't have a chance,"" she often says.) And, he had been divorced, in 1990. (""I wanted someone who knew relationships are hard,"" she said.) While her divorce was friendly -- ""We went to lunch together afterward,"" she said -- his was not. ""Lots of drama,"" said Mr. Long, who is 62 and grew up in Clemmons, N.C., surrounded by a large extended family. Ms. Shull, who was adopted, grew up as an only child in Akron, Ohio. During their golf outing, she gave him her card, which he uncharacteristically misplaced. Friends describe him as organized and detail-oriented, unbeatable at word games, well-read and funny. At the time, he worked in New York City developing tax compliance software at KPMG, the accounting firm, and spent his weekends competing in road bike races. He lived in a studio apartment that was furnished mainly with bikes and biking equipment, all meticulously maintained. Weeks later, he came upon her card and called. By then, she was preparing to move to St. Louis, partly to be closer to a half brother, John Kluge, who lived there. She and Mr. Kluge share the same biological father and first learned of each other's existence in 1999 after Ms. Shull met her biological parents.

They continued dating, traveling back and forth from New York to St. Louis and taking trips together. ""She was easy to fly with, the easiest woman to travel with I've ever known,"" he said. ""She just has this laid-back attitude."" Ms. Shull recalls first seeing Mr. Long's apartment full of bikes. ""I loved it!"" she said. ""On top of being cute and super smart, he's a crazy good athlete in crazy good shape."" In spring 2003, he persuaded her to move back to New York, which she did without hesitation. ""She doesn't have any problem picking up and leaving,"" he said. Over the next several years, the two lived in a high-rise building in Hell's Kitchen; a house in Greenwich Conn.; an apartment on Manhattan's Roosevelt Island; and another in Long Island City, Queens. In 2003, she founded ReThink, and in 2004 they acquired two Yorkshire Terriers. She taught him to ski and he encouraged her to go on long bikes rides with him, promising brunch somewhere along the way. They even briefly discussed trying to have children together (neither have children from their first marriages) but decided against it. She regrets that. ""What I know is that even in situations where there's nothing that can be done about it, you admit to the whole spectrum of feelings and the regret becomes less debilitating,"" she said.

They decided to separate and he moved to Charlotte, N.C., while she plunged into dating. She estimates she went on 50 dates in the months after their breakup, some arranged through Tinder. ""In no time flat, in every situation, I would think, 'They are not as smart as Bill, they are not as handsome as Bill, they are not as much of a gentleman as Bill,'"" she said. Mr. Long was not particularly happy, either. ""The single life didn't turn out to be as satisfying as I expected it to be,"" he said. ""It finally dawned on me, 'Let's work it out.'"" In the summer of 2015, he moved back to New York. He proposed to Ms. Shull a little over a year later, presenting her with a screen shot of a ring he thought she might like.

On April 12, the couple were married at the Aspen Mountain Club in Aspen, their favorite ski town. It was so windy that riding the gondola up to the club, atop Aspen Mountain, seemed more like a leap of faith than marriage. The ceremony was small but not subdued. Eleven guests huddled together on the club's outside deck, facing the Elk Mountains and shivering. The couple dressed neither warmly nor practically. ""We are going all out, overboard, in terms of clothes and food,"" the excited bride said. Mr. Long wore a morning suit while Ms. Shull appeared in a pink strapless organza and tulle gown, pink faux fur shawl, and a tulle veil that occasionally flew perpendicular. She was escorted onto the deck by Mr. Kluge, her half brother, who later said he was amazed to discover, upon first meeting Ms. Shull, that their feet and hands were nearly identical. The ceremony began with Chloe Smith, a recent graduate of N.Y.U., singing ""Truly Madly Deeply,"" a song by Savage Garden, the Australian pop group. With no accompaniment, and as if she were addressing a lover rather than an audience, she slowly, plaintively sang, ""I want to stand with you on top of the mountain/I want to bathe with you in the sea/I want to lie like this forever/Until the sky falls down on me."" In Colorado, no particular authorization is required of wedding officiants so the couple chose Bill Smith, Ms. Smith's father and a longtime friend, to lead them through the vows. He cried more than they did.","""The single life didn't turn out to be as satisfying as I expected it to be.

Automobiles,Experian Study Highlights Differences Between Hybrid and E.V. Owners,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/24/automobiles/experian-study-highlights-differences-between-hybrid-and-ev-owners.html,"While it may seem natural to want to shove people who buy electric vehicles and hybrids into the same pigeonhole, there are some slight differences between them.

Electric vehicle buyers tend to be younger and more affluent than hybrid buyers, according to a study by Experian Automotive, which specializes in collecting and analyzing automotive data. E.V. buyers also tend to have higher credit scores and higher monthly loan payments. Experian's study analyzed more than three million vehicles powered by alternative energy in 2013.

In terms of age, 74 percent of electric vehicle buyers are younger than 56 years old, compared with 55 percent of hybrid owners who were younger than 56. Nearly 21 percent of consumers who bought an electric vehicle had an average household income of $175,000 or more; only 12 percent of hybrid vehicle buyers had incomes at that level. Electric vehicle buyers had a higher average credit score of 749; hybrid buyers had a score of 741. The difference was greater for people who leased their vehicles. The average credit score of someone leasing an electric vehicle was 747; the average score to lease a hybrid was 729.

The top five hybrids in 2013 in terms of number on the road, in descending order, were the Toyota Prius, Toyota Camry, Honda Civic, Toyota Highlander and Ford Fusion. The top five electric models were the Nissan Leaf, the Tesla Model S, the Ford Focus, the Fiat 500e and Mitsubishi i-MIEV. More people took out loans to buy hybrids (57 percent) than leased them (22 percent); 22 percent paid cash. It was the opposite for electric vehicles. More people leased electric vehicles (87 percent) than took out loans to buy them (9 percent); 4 percent paid cash.",The study outlined the economic backgrounds and buying habits of people who bought vehicles powered by alternative energy sources.,dd2d4604-fde8-5f9c-82bd-8f85f9a42399,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/04/24/automobiles/24EXPERIAN-image/24EXPERIAN-image-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=384&w=600&s=96f5cf76ca90cd5813cd1e1ac01d9ec6f9ea9ef0b553b674f839821b42647afd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The 2013 Nissan Leaf.,dd2d4604-fde8-5f9c-82bd-8f85f9a42399,N24News/imgs/dd2d4604-fde8-5f9c-82bd-8f85f9a42399.jpg,23
Books,Sophie Hannah: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/books/review/sophie-hannah-by-the-book.html," What books are on your nightstand? ""Something Wonderful,"" by Todd S. Purdum -- the story of Rodgers and Hammerstein's working relationship. I've loved Rodgers and Hammerstein since I was 17, when I starred in a college production of ""Oklahoma!"" as Ado Annie, the girl who ""cain't say no."" And my obsession with musical theater is growing. ""Self-Coaching 101,"" by Brooke Castillo. I've been listening to Brooke's podcast, ""The Life Coach School,"" for a while now. Each week, she tackles a different problem with warmth and insight, and I'm totally addicted to her. She's quite open about being a real, flawed person and not a guru who has attained perfection. ""What You Want to See,"" by Kristen Lepionka. This is the second novel to feature the private investigator Roxane Weary, who's a wonderful character. Lepionka is such an assured writer, with complete narrative authority from the first line.

Describe your ideal reading experience (when, where, what, how). I have two ideal reading scenarios: a 12-hour business-class flight, with no work to do at all and a glass of champagne in my hand, or on a sun lounger next to a beautiful swimming pool/on a beach. My third favorite reading option is: in a lavender-scented bubble bath. What's your favorite book of all time? I need three! Can I have three? I'm going to assume I can: ""The Black Prince,"" by Iris Murdoch. The book is so great, I almost feel it has magic powers. It's tragic, comic, mysterious, thought-provoking and so much more than the sum of its parts. It manages to be both a great detective story and a great love story at the same time. It's the only book I've ever read that feels as if it encapsulates all of life and the human experience. ""Coming From Behind,"" by Howard Jacobson, a novel about a disappointed academic whose career is an embarrassment to him. It's the funniest book I've ever read. Every sentence is a comic masterpiece in its own right. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

""The Hollow,"" by Agatha Christie. This book doesn't get nearly as much praise as it deserves. It's a watertight mystery with vivid, memorable characters. There's a surreal scene in which the murder is discovered by Hercule Poirot that is both visually and psychologically brilliant -- my favorite crime scene in the whole genre. You've now written three books featuring Hercule Poirot, the great Agatha Christie detective. Tell us about your experience as a Christie reader and fan.

I've loved Agatha Christie ever since I read ""The Body in the Library"" when I was 12. I devoured it, and then read all her other books in two years. I loved them all! They were hooky, baffling, funny and full of wisdom and insight. I never asked to write new Hercule Poirot novels -- I would never have been so presumptuous, and to be honest it wouldn't have occurred to me in a million years. My agent happened to broach the idea with an editor at HarperCollins (without my knowledge!) at exactly the same time as Agatha Christie's grandson told the same editor that the family might be ready for a continuation novel. So we all met up, we got on amazing well, and pretty soon we'd all decided that we wanted to proceed. Writing about my favorite character is still a huge honor, and the Christie family have been so amazingly supportive and great to work with. Who's your favorite fictional detective? And the best villain? Hercule Poirot is the greatest detective, of course, closely followed by Agatha Christie's other ""main"" sleuth, Miss Marple. My favorite fictional villain would have to be Mr. Brocklehurst or Aunt Reed in Charlotte Bronte's ""Jane Eyre,"" or Hindley Earnshaw in Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights."" I tend to feel sorry for almost all villains, but not those ones. I loathe them all and still want to give them a hard punch on the nose, decades after I first met them. One essential ingredient is a hook that's irresistible, and considerably more mysterious than ""Who killed this dead person?"" In my books, I try wherever I can to make the plot hook/mystery something that's very weird and unusual, or even something that's apparently impossible: In my thriller ""Keep Her Safe,"" a woman sees and hears a little girl in a hotel room -- but that girl is the most famous murder victim in America. So why isn't she dead? I want the reader to wonder, ""How on earth can this be possible?"" and not be able to think of an explanation. Then my job is to show them how it's not only possible but inevitable, once you know the whole story. Agatha Christie did this brilliantly, all the time. In ""Sleeping Murder,"" a woman moves into a new house in a place she's never visited or been to before, but she knows exactly what she's going to see in that house -- right down to the pattern of the wallpaper. And then she sees a body that no one else can see. With a mystery as intriguing as that, it's impossible not to read on. Another essential ingredient of a great crime novel is a surprising solution to the mystery. I hate it when I can guess what's going to happen. What kinds of stories are you drawn to? And what do you steer clear of? I'm drawn to confidently written novels with strong narrative authority, plenty of attitude, incredibly gripping plots, and complex, flawed characters. Tana French is one of my all-time favorites. She delivers on every level. I also love great memoirs. My two all-time favorites are ""House Rules,"" by Rachel Sontag, and ""You Don't Look Like Anyone I Know,"" by Heather Sellers. I steer clear of novels that don't hook me by the end of the first chapter. What books might we be surprised to find on your shelves? My self-help/New Age book collection! I am an addict. Write a book and call it something like ""The Five Secrets of Badass Kickassery"" and I will buy it immediately! I can't help it. So, I have ""The Secret,"" by Rhonda Byrne, ""The Essence of Enlightenment,"" by James Swartz, ""The Power of Now,"" by Eckhart Tolle, ""The Life-Changing Magic of Not Giving a F*ck,"" by Sarah Knight. (Though I'm not keen on the ones that tell you what everyone ought to be able to work out for themselves: ""Improve Your Life by Cleaning Your Windows if You Can't See Through the Greasy Panes"" -- surely that is so obvious that no one needs a book giving that advice?) As it turns out, all this self-help reading over the years was research I didn't know I would one day need. I ended up writing my own self-help book, ""How to Hold a Grudge."" The book's subtitle is ""From Resentment to Contentment -- the Power of Grudges to Transform Your Life."" Scribner is publishing it in 2019.

Who is your favorite overlooked or underappreciated writer? I'm going to mention a favorite overlooked novel: ""Half Broken Things,"" by Morag Joss. It's a stunning, haunting and provocative psychological suspense novel that anyone who cares about literature should read. It ought to be widely recognized as a classic. What kind of reader were you as a child? I was a voracious reader of mysteries -- Enid Blyton's ""The Secret Seven"" and ""The Five Finder-Outers"" series, the McGurk mysteries by E. W. Hildick, Agatha Christie's books -- and also lots of poetry. Ferris Bueller. He had a profound effect on me, and helped me to hone my skiving skills at a crucial time in my life. What's the last book you recommended to a member of your family? ""The 7 1/2  Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle,"" by Stuart Turton, a startlingly original debut crime novel. It's set in a country house, where the same murder keeps happening over and over again. The only way to break the cycle is to find the killer. What's the best book you ever received as a gift? What book did you feel you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? There are so many! I don't want to bad-mouth any individual author or book, but one kind of book I often give up is the sort that starts with the heroine getting a phone call from someone in her past. She's immediately terrified and goes into panic/concealment mode, afraid that her Terrible Secret From the Past will be revealed. I've seen this device about a thousand times. I'd love it if, just for once, a heroine would react to a call from the Past Person by saying: ""Helloooo! Hey, remember that murder we committed together? Wasn't it fun? Shall we get together and reminisce about it?""

If you were to write something besides crime fiction, what would you write? Musicals. I know this because I'm already writing them. Last year, my first murder mystery musical was staged for the first time, and it's about to embark on a mini-tour of the United Kingdom. I'm also working on a second musical -- a musical courtroom drama this time! I write the lyrics and the play, and the music is written by my friend Annette Armitage, who is a brilliant composer and all-around musical genius. Whom would you choose to write your life story? No one, ideally. My novels and poetry and musicals are my life story -- just in a more mashed-up form. If you could meet any writer, dead or alive, who would it be? What would you want to know? I'd like to meet Herman Melville so that I could ask him ""But why?"" over and over again about ""Bartleby, the Scrivener"" (one of my all-time favorite books). What book do you think everybody should read before they die? ""So You've Been Publicly Shamed,"" by Jon Ronson. I spend a lot of time (some might even say too much time) on Twitter, and I'm regularly horrified by how cruel and judgmental people are; quick to condemn and abuse in the face of even minor and quite reasonable disagreement. I hate the eagerness of so many people to find bad guys and draw them to the world's attention for public vilification. Jon Ronson's book makes a brilliant case for never doing that. What do you plan to read next? ""Social Creature,"" by Tara Isabella Burton, a psychological thriller about social media and toxic relationships, set in New York, and ""Baby Teeth,"" by Zoje Stage, a debut suspense novel about a mother trying to find help for her daughter as their relationship becomes more dangerous.","Sophie Hannah, whose Hercule Poirot novel ""The Mystery of Three Quarters"" will be published this month, is addicted to self-help: ""Write a book and call it something like 'The Five Secrets of Badass Kickassery' and I will buy it immediately.""",c1adc53e-a442-5fd6-8f63-9a1033051c1e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/books/review/05ByTheBook/05ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=498&w=951&s=df4f91549a7c398110999b5570377c6be2346bde2cb9c0662eeef56be702370a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sophie Hannah,c1adc53e-a442-5fd6-8f63-9a1033051c1e,N24News/imgs/c1adc53e-a442-5fd6-8f63-9a1033051c1e.jpg,13
Dance,"Review: In 'Latitude,' Dance in Silence Makes Its Own Inner Music",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/11/arts/dance/latitude-review-dana-reitz-lumberyard.html,"You might be watching a community of nuns or worker bees. These women, dressed in calf-length culottes with chemises and jackets in dark pastel colors, remain gently purposeful throughout. The movement is entirely flat-footed, often pedestrian, with impulses now rigorous, now mild. Dancers bend from the knee or waist; arms and spines ripple and stretch.

Often they employ four wooden rods or sticks. Sometimes they arrange them to make various mini- or maxi-geometries on the floor. Or they wield them like implements -- punt poles, divining rods, balancing poles, spears used as if to catch fish. One striking effect comes when we watch one dancer walking, with long rod, outstretched along a central line of shadow; because the zones on either side of her are lighted from different sources, her straight rod casts the shadow of a broken line.

The mood stays soft, hushed. On three or four occasions, the dancers murmur to one another; you can't hear words. The only other sounds are from the sticks (some loud percussive clacks) or breathing. (Ms. Demyanenko's series of sighs at the end of one solo is distracting, contrived.) Yet nothing is monotonous. Although the dynamics are mainly muted, they contain gradations, contrasts. The three at times move like a single team, at others like three independent people engaged in unrelated tasks.

Travel,A Toronto Restaurant Both Simple and Iconoclastic,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/03/travel/brothers-food-wine-restaurant-toronto-review.html,"You might not know it by appearances, but Brothers Food & Wine in Toronto is run by a couple of young iconoclasts: co-owners Chris White, 30, and Jonathan Nicolaou, 33, who shares chef duties with Keenan McVey, 29. The two met in Toronto culinary circles, then rose up through boundary-pushing London kitchens -- Dandelyan for Mr. White; St. John for Mr. Nicolaou.

But talk to Mr. White and you get the sense that they have no interest in their restaurant being of-the-moment.

""We don't use words like seasonal and local because they've been garbaged,"" he said. The menu, which changes daily, ""is rooted in our personal history and heritage."" Simplicity is the key: ""The more we think about a dish, the less we like it.""

That's evident on the plate at Brothers, which opened last October in a slim, plain space just above the Bay Street subway station (you may occasionally feel the train rumbling under your feet). During a recent meal, dishes were indeed presented without much adornment. But their flavors -- drawing from (sorry, Mr. White) seasonal, local ingredients -- were complex and satisfying.","The food at Brothers Food & Wine, which opened last October in a slim, plain space just above the Bay Street subway station, is richly complex and utterly satisfying.",c692d7c2-51ac-5164-a226-e5128cc2956d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/03/travel/03bites-dish/03bites-dish-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=770f62d174a9fdd3f6edc77c4b4afa26b3b6ef69c437893e605fce477b9a10ca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Beef carpaccio with radicchio and toasted pine nuts at Brothers Food & Wine.,c692d7c2-51ac-5164-a226-e5128cc2956d,N24News/imgs/c692d7c2-51ac-5164-a226-e5128cc2956d.jpg,4
Books,Questlove: By the Book,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/books/review/questlove-by-the-book.html," What books are on your nightstand? I go through things in batches, and recently I've been trying to read more about movies. The top book on the nightstand is Owen Gleiberman's ""Movie Freak,"" which is about his love of movies and his life as a movie-lover. Who is your favorite novelist of all time? And your favorite novelist writing today? I don't read as much fiction. I'm not a fiction person. I tend to go for biographies and oral histories and books about art of all kinds. I was gifted copies of Ishmael Reed novels like ""The Free-Lance Pallbearers"" and ""Mumbo Jumbo,"" and those were really eye-opening. What book, if any, most influenced your decision to become a musician or contributed to your artistic development?

In terms of becoming a musician, I was influenced most by my family -- my dad was a musician, and he had a singing group with my mom, and my sister and I toured around with them. When I read about musicians at that time, it tended to be in magazines, which were still healthy. Rolling Stone had a huge impact on me. There were some books that nudged me in the same direction, though. Because Dad was mentioned in David Ritz's ""Divided Soul,"" I read that, and I also read Nelson George's ""The Michael Jackson Story."" Who are your favorite musician-writers? Your favorite memoir by a musician? There are some usual suspects: Miles Davis's book with Quincy Troupe, Charles Mingus's ""Beneath the Underdog."" One of my favorites is a fairly recent book, ""Root for the Villain,"" by J-Zone. It's by a rapper, about his inability to make it. It's a brilliant book, and it scared the crap out of me -- I have never seen someone revel in his failure quite the way he does. When I wrote ""Something to Food About,"" I looked at so many books and cookbooks by chefs like Dominique Crenn, Massimo Bottura, Michael Solomonov, Ferran Adria and others. I also got into ""Modernist Cuisine: The Art and Science of Cooking,"" written by a team led by Nathan Myhrvold, and I haven't gotten out yet -- it's a giant multivolume project that's impossible to finish. They have a new book out about bread and I got to see part of the process of making that book when I visited Nathan's Willy Wonka laboratory. Apart from the books I read to write ""Something to Food About,"" there's a book called ""Vegan Soul Kitchen,"" by Bryant Terry, that was very important to me. It has recipes in it, but it also talks about the social and racial history of soul food. It inspired my 200-day run with vegetarianism. ""The Cooking Gene,"" by Michael W. Twitty, is also a must-read. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

What books might we be surprised to find on your bookshelves? I read lots of self-help books. Therapists are big on seeing you in person and on a consistent basis, so finding one who is willing to video chat at odd hours is rare. Also, I'm usually at my lowest when I'm about to make a record, which is when I have the least time to go and see someone. For that reason, when I need to reframe my way of thinking and be clear about the ways I might be sabotaging a process, I consult self-help books. Two recent ones I read were ""Battlefield of the Mind,"" by Joyce Meyer, and ""Confidence: Overcoming Low Self-Esteem, Insecurity, and Self-Doubt,"" by Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic. Look, his name is literally pre-music. What are the best books about music you've read? It's hard to pick just one or even just five or 10. I get different things from each book. Sometimes I'm looking for out-of-the-way stories. Sometimes I'm looking for practical advice. Greg Tate made me want to be a writer. I was amazed that a musician was so fluid and had enough knowledge to describe and analyze other people's music so well. I read him in The Village Voice, but his work was collected in books like ""Flyboy in the Buttermilk.""

What's the last book you read that made you laugh? Jenifer Lewis's memoir, ""The Mother of Black Hollywood."" She's an actress who has worked in television and film for decades. She played Tupac's mother in ""Poetic Justice"" and Tina Turner's mother in ""What's Love Got to Do With It?"" Now she's in ""Black-ish."" Her book was hilarious. I listened to the audiobook, and it was so good that it made me step up my audiobook game for ""Creative Quest."" The last book you read that made you cry? After Prince died, a wave of books came out: Duane Tudahl's book on the ""Purple Rain"" studio sessions, Ben Greenman's ""Dig if You Will the Picture"" and Mayte Garcia's ""The Most Beautiful."" I wrote forewords for some of them. To see Prince humanized, to see his effect on other writers and thinkers, made it all that much harder to reconcile with the fact that he was gone. The last book you read that made you furious? ""Fire and Fury,"" and not for the reasons you would think. I mainly thought about how the president would drop his guard for this guy. I don't feel bad for him; you get what you have coming to you. But when I researched the author and started to understand how he must have portrayed himself to get access, what does that say about the president's judgment, or self-awareness, or even self-protection? I had to set the book aside at some point pretty early on. What kind of reader were you as a child? Your favorite book? Most beloved character? When my family and I drove to shows, not only was I my dad's GPS, but I was also his human audiobook. He would make me read to him, hours at a time, from the novelizations of whatever movies were current: ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind,"" ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Jaws,"" whatever. At the time it seemed like father-son bonding. Now I think maybe he was tricking me. My favorite children's book was Dr. Seuss' ""My Book About Me,"" which is a kind of guided workbook that lets you write your own autobiography. I carried it around as if I wrote it, which I guess I did. I was so proud. To this day, I love that book -- I probably have 50 blank copies of it in storage. I was also obsessed with a series called ""The Happy Hollisters."" It's about a family of younger kids (the oldest are tweens) who go on adventures, not ghosts and goblins, but more realistic ones, like Hardy Boys-type mysteries. I really got into them. Those were a big deal for me. If you had to name one book that made you who you are today, what would it be? ""The Autobiography of Malcolm X"" changed my life. I read it when I was 15, and that -- along with discovering Public Enemy and Afrocentric hip-hop -- kind of went hand in hand as a consciousness-builder and creator. If you could require the president to read one book, what would it be? ""Marvin K. Mooney Will You Please Go Now!""

You're hosting a literary dinner party. Which three writers are invited? Alex Haley, because of Malcolm X. Do they have to be living? Let me start over. I would say two women whom I have met in real life and hung out with: bell hooks and Fran Lebowitz. For the third, let's say Quincy Jones. I know he isn't thought of mainly as an author, but he has written books, and if I am hosting a dinner party, I'll be damned if he's not there. Disappointing, overrated, just not good: What book did you feel as if you were supposed to like, and didn't? Do you remember the last book you put down without finishing? I'm kind of obsessive about finishing books, even if it takes me a while. I don't want to single out any books -- now that I know how hard they are to write, I don't like saying that books are disappointing just because they didn't get through to me in the right way -- but if I had to pick one, I would pick my own book on ""Soul Train."" I want to take another shot at it. When I did that book, I had to break my thinking into separate themed essays. I want to redo it as a definitive project. What's the one book you wish someone else would write? I have a very specific idea. I'm obsessed with the real conditions that afflicted working musicians, and I have an idea that looks at race and music in the middle of the 20th century. I don't want to tip my hand. Maybe I'll end up being the someone else who writes it. Who would you want to write your life story? Well, I already wrote my life story, ""Mo' Meta Blues,"" but my thinking about how to redo it has more to do with genres. I've been really into audiobooks lately. When I get around to doing the audio version of that book the way I want, I think it would be great to hear my life reflected through voices that aren't me. So maybe it's not about writing my life story so much as re-presenting it as a communal kind of radio play. What books do you find yourself returning to again and again? Every woman I have ever dated, with the exception of my current (and hopefully final) girlfriend, made it a deal breaker that I go through the whole ""Harry Potter"" series. It hasn't worked, but I have acquired at least six or seven sets of Potters. What books are you embarrassed not to have read yet? I read ""The Great Gatsby"" in high school, though I think maybe at the last minute I ended up Cliffs Noting part of it. (Still got a B!) I want to sit down and read it again, fo real, with a group. What do you plan to read next? I'm excited for Michelle Obama's book, ""Becoming."" I can't wait to see her take on life in the White House.","The musician Questlove, author most recently of ""Creative Quest,"" grew up reading to his father on car trips. ""At the time it seemed like father-son bonding. Now I think maybe he was tricking me.""",7a761d28-d0b0-5ec5-8b02-5a1f15992e1e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/15/books/review/15ByTheBook/15ByTheBook-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=484&w=924&s=47d4cd15637df703b78a1e1b1437a699a25d399152e4c07c05aab1414f82146e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Questlove,7a761d28-d0b0-5ec5-8b02-5a1f15992e1e,N24News/imgs/7a761d28-d0b0-5ec5-8b02-5a1f15992e1e.jpg,13
Travel,"It Just Got Easier, and May Soon Be Cheaper, for Americans to Travel to Brazil",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/25/travel/brazil-visa-us-citizens-online.html,"It Just Got Easier, and May Soon Be Cheaper, for Americans to Travel to Brazil 
* None   Lianne Milton for The New York Times

Starting this week, Americans wishing to visit Brazil will be able to apply online for a visa for a $40 fee, down from the $160 fee applicants were previously charged at consulates. Brazil rolled out the new e-visa system, which is also available for Japanese, Canadian and Australian citizens, in an effort to jump-start its tourism sector, which has struggled amid rising violence in much of the country, a prolonged economic recession and residual apprehension following the 2016 Zika epidemic. ""If we want to compete for international tourists, we need to do away with the bureaucracy and extend a red carpet so they choose our destinations,"" Brazil's tourism minister Marx Beltrao said in a statement. The e-visa program is kicking in weeks before the Brazilian government is expected to sign an ""open skies"" agreement with the United States. The pact will allow market forces, rather than government regulators, to dictate the frequency and destination of flights between the two countries. Brazil's Senate is expected to approve the deal next month, following passage in the lower House of Congress last month. Open skies agreements that Washington has signed with other countries have significantly expanded the number of daily flights, leading to cheaper fares. Since the United States signed one with Colombia in 2010, for instance, three new airlines began offering service between the two countries, eight new routes were launched and daily flights more than doubled. The Brazilian government estimates that the e-visa system will increase travel from the four eligible countries by 25 percent and make Brazil a more attractive destination to hold conferences and other large events. More than 570,000 Americans traveled to Brazil in 2016, according to the tourism ministry, a figure exceeded only by the number of Argentines who flock to the beaches in the country each year. So why visit Brazil now? Having arrived here last July to run coverage of the southern cone of South America for The New York Times, I have a few tips -- and a word of caution. Rio de Janeiro, my new hometown, is a dazzling seaside metropolis with an embarrassment of riches for beachgoers and music lovers. If you've never been, it should be at the top of your list. You should be mindful, however, that like much of Brazil, Rio de Janeiro is grappling with an epidemic of violence. It is easy to overlook in tourist hot spots like the area that includes the beaches of Ipanema and Copacabana, but you should do your homework to avoid stumbling into a dangerous neighborhood. Another caveat: brace yourself for reliably inattentive service. If gorgeous beaches surrounded by a constellation of mountains isn't your thing, Sao Paulo, the largest metropolis in South America, has more to offer in the way of museums, awe-inspiring architecture and culinary innovation. You can visit what may be the coolest building in Latin America: the curvaceous Copan built by the renowned Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer downtown. Or the modern Museu do Futebol, an ode to the country's soccer-rich history tucked inside the Art Deco Pacaembu Stadium. But be forewarned about the city's notorious traffic jams and graffiti-smeared streets that give much of the city a blighted feel. If you've been there, done that, consider going a bit further afield. You can travel to Brazil's wine country -- yes, there is one! -- near the southern city of Porto Alegre. While Brazil's wine sector is dwarfed by industry titans Argentina and Chile, several sparkling wines made here are excellent and reasonably priced. Seeking more adventure than a buzz? Consider a trip to the Pantanal, the largest wetlands in the world, in Mato Grosso do Sul state. You can catch a glimpse of jaguars, macaws and caimans by going on safari-like tours. There are also beautiful waterfalls and freshwater rivers to swim in. As a relative newcomer to Brazil, I'd be delighted to get tips from veteran travelers. Tweet or email me about destinations that exceeded your expectations, funky hotels and delightful eats.","Brazil is hoping to attract more tourists by allowing Americans, Canadians, Japanese and Australian citizens to obtain visas online.

Global Business,Europe's Bank Deal Is Seen as Progress With Flaws,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/business/global/european-banking-deal-is-seen-as-progress-with-flaws.html,"BRUSSELS -- European finance ministers made further progress early Thursday morning toward a long-sought uniform approach to bank regulation on the Continent with an agreement to require shareholders and creditors to take significant losses when banks collapse. It may not be the ""revolutionary change in the way banks are treated in the European Union"" that the Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, trumpeted after the late-night session. The agreement is intended to reduce the chance that a bank crisis will descend into a government debt crisis, as happened in Spain and Ireland when the cost of bank rescues helped undermine public finances. But because Germany insisted on high hurdles before its taxpayers would be made liable for bank failures in other countries, there remains a risk that weaker countries could still become victims of the failure of a big domestic bank.

""There is not much sharing of the costs across the euro zone,"" said Marie Diron, an economist in London who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young. The 60 billion euro, or $78 billion, in euro zone money that has been allocated for bank recapitalization ""is nothing,"" she said. ""It would be exhausted very quickly."" The deal on banks is aimed at breaking the so-called doom loop, in which struggling governments take their states deeper into debt to save their banking systems, only to face sky-high sovereign borrowing costs. Analysts were cautious about declaring an end to Europe's banking woes. ""Is it the best solution to break the doom loop? Of course it's not,"" said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. He said Germany was unlikely to agree to pay for past mistakes by banks or bank regulators in other countries, even after the German national elections in the autumn. Mr. Veron said he expected the agreement to be modified as it went through the European Parliament, as leaders weigh some of the consequences of forcing creditors and some depositors to help pay for bank rescues.

But as European Union heads of state arrived here on Thursday for a two-day summit meeting, they sought to put the finance ministers' deal in the best possible light. Francois Hollande, the French president, hailed the breakthrough as ""extremely useful for protecting savers and to avoid having taxpayers pay for a banking crisis for which they are not responsible."" The German chancellor, Angela Merkel, speaking to her Parliament in Berlin on Thursday before heading to Brussels, thanked her finance minister, Wolfgang Schauble, for his efforts on the bank deal. ""The priority will be to make the creditors and owners responsible, and we get away from taxpayers always putting up for the banks,"" Ms. Merkel said. ""This is really necessary.""

The new system is expected to go into full effect in 2018. It specifies the order in which banks' investors and creditors, and then uninsured depositors, will face losses.

* Clearview AI does well in another round of facial recognition accuracy tests. Deposits under 100,000 euros would remain protected. Small businesses and individual savers with more than 100,000 euros would enjoy better protection than other categories of unsecured creditors when losses were imposed. Such clarity could help prevent a recurrence of the chaos that ensued during the bailout for Cyprus in March, when governments and international lenders initially agreed to penalize small savers because of the lack of a template for imposing losses on the country's troubled banks.

Ms. Diron, the London economist, warned that the agreement could increase the interest rates banks pay to raise the money they lend to customers. But that is a necessary adjustment, she said. Rates banks paid in the past were too low, because investors assumed that they would be bailed out by governments. ""Investors will now price in the risk of losing their money,"" Ms. Diron added. ""But that should have happened already."" The deal gives countries like Britain some flexibility to choose where losses will fall, as long as bondholders and shareholders representing 8 percent of a failing bank's total liabilities are wiped out first. Sweden won leeway for even more flexibility to make exemptions to certain classes of creditors in exchange for other commitments. Germany was especially wary of endorsing new rules that could eventually mean the use of shared European money to directly inject new capital into other countries' failing banks. As a concession to German concerns, the ministers agreed to significant measures. Before using cash directly from the shared European fund, a bank would need to draw the maximum amount permissible from its own government bailout money. Governments then would need to put any initial money drawn from the shared European fund onto their national balance sheets.","The agreement is intended to reduce the chance that a bank crisis will create a government debt crisis, but risk to weaker countries remains.",4521be3d-2901-591b-b978-b9df72f49c85,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/28/business/EUBanks/EUBanks-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=44000a226dc1ea80a5737f5b95e4b417aad0364cd8690cad15ea847102b83743&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany with Prime Minister Antonis Samaras of Greece on Thursday in Brussels.,4521be3d-2901-591b-b978-b9df72f49c85,N24News/imgs/4521be3d-2901-591b-b978-b9df72f49c85.jpg,24
Science,"In California, Water Restrictions Above Ground and Leaks Below",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/science/california-turns-to-stopping-water-leaks.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Californians have been ordered to save water because of the drought. But one of the best ways to save it is to not lose it in the first place. That is why many cities in this thirsty state have declared a war on leaks. Here on Whitsett Avenue in the San Fernando Valley -- or rather about 20 feet below it -- the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power is replacing much of the Coldwater trunk line, a major artery more than 100 years old. The new pipe, five feet across, sits at the bottom of a deep trench. Before long, after each seam is welded seven times around and coated with cement, nine million gallons of water will flow through here every day. ""It's not going to leak till I'm way far gone,"" Dane Saunders, a senior water utility supervisor, said as he crouched in the cool darkness of the pipe.

California's water systems lose, on average, about 10 percent of the water they carry, according to Reinhard Sturm, the chief operating officer at Water Systems Optimization, a consulting company for controlling water loss. Mr. Sturm, who has consulted with many of the state's cities, estimated that some 40 percent of those losses could be stopped with fixes that make sense financially. That works out to enough additional water for two million people a year. The state is also facing some pressure to walk the talk. It is awkward, after all, for a government to tell its citizens to let their lawns dry out when water main breaks can send millions of gallons flowing through city streets.

In fact, California's water systems leak less than those in some other parts of the country, particularly older Northeastern cities like Philadelphia and New York. But many of those have plentiful and cheap water. In drought states, the price of water has jumped, changing the calculations about the need to plug leaks. That incentive makes a difference: As with most infrastructure issues, unless water is a problem -- too much of it gushing across streets, too little of it in reservoirs -- it goes largely unnoticed. ""We're not spending enough on our infrastructure,"" said Greg DiLoreto, a former president of the American Society of Civil Engineers and a retired chief executive of a water district in Oregon. Whatever money water utilities get, he said, ""the first dollar will always go to safe drinking water"" and not to pipes. Los Angeles is paying close attention to its pipes, however. Its water agency targets lines with a history of leaking, and those in soil conditions that promote erosion. It also looks for pipes near critical facilities like hospitals, and in places with hilly terrain that could lead to violent flooding once the rogue water begins to flow. As the leak prevention program has been ramped up, the number of leaks in the system has dropped to 1,146 in the fiscal year 2013-14 from 2,031 in 2006-7. ""The key for us for replacement is to replace the right pipes,"" said Marty Adams, who heads the water system for the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. Other California cities are finding that leak patrols pay off. Cloverdale, in northern Sonoma County, hired outside consultants to cut its losses. They tracked down a pipe with a crack that went all the way around it, gushing water. None came to the surface, where it would have been obvious; instead, it flowed into a nearby storm drain.

Other California cities are upgrading their systems to better measure the water they have, and lose. Sacramento did not even have water meters on most of its homes a decade ago, said Bill Busath, director of the department of utilities. But half of the city is metered now, and all of it will be by 2020. The new meters can be read remotely and are sensitive enough to alert the water company to an individual homeowner's leaky lawn irrigation system or a loose flapper ball in a toilet tank. ""You'd be surprised how many gallons per hour a leaky toilet flapper will leak,"" Mr. Busath said. The first step for a city to understand how much water it is losing is to understand how much water it has. That means performing a water audit -- a measurement of water flow throughout the system that can detect and pinpoint loss. Major leaks are found and fixed fairly quickly, but more water escapes from smaller leaks that go undetected over the long term, said Andrew Chastain-Howley, a founder of the water audit software subcommittee for the American Water Works Association. ""There's no such thing as a utility that doesn't have water loss,"" he added. California's initial efforts to get cities to perform voluntary audits and submit their data were disappointing, so the state now requires them.

Ed Osann, a water expert with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which helped put together procedures for the initial voluntary audits, said, ""For whatever reason, the audits still, as a group, are way too buggy."" Mr. Sturm estimated that 35 percent of the audits submitted so far were inaccurate, but said that he expected them to improve. Leak detection can be as simple as listening for the sounds of escaping water by putting a microphone, or even a sound-conducting steel rod or ""listening stick,"" against a pipe. High-tech solutions might compare wave forms from microphones. Some robotic leak sensors travel through pipes. Here in Los Angeles, officials say that the city uses old and new techniques to test for leaks, but that the age and the variety of materials and sizes of pipes mean that no one method or technology can do it all. The pipe that sprung a spectacular leak last year on Sunset Boulevard at the University of California, Los Angeles, campus had been inspected just two years before with the latest electronic equipment. After that blowout, many vendors approached Steve Cole, the manager of engineering in the city department's water distribution division. ""They'd say, 'I've got the magic bullet,' "" he recalled. But because of the complexity of the sprawling system, ""what we realized,"" he said, was that ""there really isn't a magic bullet."" The city is also testing pipe that is resistant to earthquakes. Manufactured in Japan, each length of pipe allows four inches of play with the next segment, and can shift under stress without breaking.

In the past, even major breaks seemed inconsequential compared with the amount used by the city. The U.C.L.A. break wasted 28 million gallons, but ""that's just a little over 4 percent of our daily delivery,"" Mr. Castruita said. These water officials know that the days for dismissing leaks have passed. ""A gallon of water is pennies,"" he said. ""It's the loss that's the tragedy.""","In the midst of a devastating drought, the state finds that no loss of water is trivial and goes about finding and fixing them.",143dad97-e658-5de5-bf19-f1861cfe7493,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/30/science/30LEAKS/30LEAKS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=9ac0409a365369b55be572368f56920663349022e37449c25a4e5e34f8bde405&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shawn Bushler, a Los Angeles Department of Water and Power supervisor, checked the air quality inside a recently installed 60-inch water pipe in the San Fernando Valley.

Real Estate,"Cole Valley, San Francisco: Where High Prices Meet Low Inventory",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/31/realestate/cole-valley-san-francisco-where-high-prices-meet-low-inventory.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Devang Bhatt and his wife, Lamisa Parkar, were living in Boston in 2013 when he landed a job in San Francisco with Genentech, a biotechnology company. Ms. Parkar temporarily stayed back in Boston while Mr. Bhatt settled in corporate housing in San Francisco and went out alone each weekend to scope out condos for around $1 million. They wanted at least two bedrooms, with a backyard for their Shetland sheepdog, Duke, as well as parking and nearby public transportation. From Boston, Ms. Parkar would make a list of open houses she wanted her husband to attend, and Mr. Bhatt would spend Saturdays driving to check them out.

""Back then the good properties were selling so quickly, for all cash at 30 percent over the offering price,"" said Mr. Bhatt, 40. ""But this one had been on the market before and the competition was low."" Ms. Parkar, 38, flew to San Francisco, and they quickly offered $1.035 million. They did an additional $200,000 worth of renovations, breaking down walls to create an open living room, and adding central heating, a half bathroom and new floors. In six years, their family has expanded: A son was born in 2018, and another baby is on the way. Cole Valley, Mr. Bhatt said, has been the right place for their family.

""There are lots of kids in the neighborhood and we can walk to three different parks, which is great,"" he said. ""People are so friendly here. Our stroller is big and we also have a dog, so we take up the entire sidewalk when we are walking, but people are quite understanding and they give us space. It's a family-oriented neighborhood."" Ms. Parkar, who also works in the health care industry, takes the N Judah line of the Muni Metro light-rail line, which makes two stops in Cole Valley, directly to her job in downtown San Francisco. Mr. Bhatt rides the Genentech shuttle bus, which collects employees in the morning and deposits them at the company's South San Francisco headquarters.

Living in Cole Valley, he said, has made the difference for their happiness in the city. ""Every neighborhood in San Francisco has its own character and vibe, but Cole Valley is really a small village within itself,"" said Mr. Bhatt. ""The dry cleaners know us by name. At the pet store, they give treats to our dog."" Kimberly Rosania purchased her Cole Valley home in 2018, while she was doing her doctoral training in child psychology. She had gotten used to taking BART from Hayes Valley, where she and her husband were previously renting, to an internship at Children's Hospital Oakland. When she completed her degree, she found a teaching position at Stanford -- a plum job, but one that forced her to abandon the ease of public transportation and drive to work instead. She commutes by car three days a week, and spends two days a week at home with her 2-year-old daughter. And while she admits she hates the 35-mile drive to Palo Alto, she loves her days in the neighborhood. ""Cole Valley is a friendly, safe neighborhood that feels almost suburban, but you're still connected to all the things I love about the city,"" she said.

Ms. Rosania, 35, jogs through Golden Gate Park with her daughter in the stroller, pops into the local grocery for croissants and coffee, and takes advantage of the many playgrounds scattered around the neighborhood. ""I feel very welcomed as someone with a little person with me,"" he said. ""There are so many restaurants I can walk into where they have crayons and high chairs for my daughter, and also good food."" Her husband works at a tech company in downtown San Francisco, and the N Judah train makes his commute easy. On the weekends, he gardens in the backyard of their three-bedroom home, which they bought after an intense bidding war for $3.95 million. ""We wanted to find a house where the three of us could easily spend time together at home,"" said Ms. Rosania. ""All the other stuff, the neighborhood -- it was the icing on the cake.""

Cole Valley wraps around the southeast corner of Golden Gate Park, just below Haight-Ashbury. Cole Street, its commercial thoroughfare, has a number of quaint mom-and-pop shops, including Cole Hardware and the gourmet spot Say Cheese. There are also a number of popular restaurants, including Zazie, a French bistro whose weekend brunch has become something of an institution; upscale Mexican Padrecito; and Beit Rima, a newcomer with Palestinian cuisine. At The Ice Cream Bar, an Art Deco-style soda fountain with a 1930s vibe, employees wear bow ties and all the sweets are made from scratch. 451 FREDERICK STREET | A two-bedroom, one-and-a-half-bath house, built in 1900 and listed for $1.55 million. 415-370-5277 Peter Prato for The New York Times The N Judah Muni Metro light rail line has stops at Carl Street and Cole Street, as well as at Carl Street and Stanyan Street. With classic Victorian rowhouses and less than a fifth of a square mile of land, Cole Valley has high prices and limited inventory. But following a trend seen across San Francisco, home values are cooling. ""Cole Valley is very expensive because, for one thing, very little comes on the market. People who are there are there to stay,"" said Marc Dickow, a partner at Core7 Real Estate and the 2020 president of the San Francisco Association of Realtors. ""And it's beautiful. I haven't gone into a single house in Cole Valley that wasn't, like, wow."" In 2019, the median price for single-family homes and condos in Cole Valley was $1.55 million, down from a median of $1.8 million in 2018 and $2.43 million in 2017, according to the San Francisco Association of Realtors.

Renters will pay upward of $2,000 for a studio, and as much as $5,000 for a two-bedroom apartment. 474 FREDERICK STREET | A duplex property: the upper unit is a three-bedroom, two-bath split level with a balcony; the lower unit is a single story with two bedrooms and one bath, and is listed at $1.995 million . 415-935-1014 Peter Prato for The New York Times Steve Silberman has lived in Cole Valley since 1981. Seven years ago, when a major storm caused flooding and a neighborhood blackout, he went to Say Cheese on Cole Street. Cash registers were down and electricity was out, and the owner, Roger Soudah, had put out cured meats, cheeses and breads for locals to take on the honor system. It hardly surprised him. ""People are good to each other here,"" said Mr. Silberman, 62, a science writer. ""There's a kind of awareness among neighbors, of being concerned and earnest about one another's lives, but not intrusive."" Mr. Silberman, the author of the 2015 book ""NeuroTribes: The Legacy of Autism and the Future of Neurodiversity,"" said the community vibe is what prompted him to start a Cole Valley Community Facebook group, which today has nearly 6,000 members. He has watched over the years as those members have become younger and wealthier.

On the N Judah line, the ride to downtown San Francisco from Cole Valley takes about 20 minutes. Shuttle buses from several of the city's major tech companies, including Google and Facebook, have pickups in the neighborhood. For drivers, the ride to South San Francisco at rush hour will take about 35 minutes; Silicon Valley will take more than an hour. The spot at Carl and Cole Streets where commuters now catch the N Judah line was once a streetcar stop, which helped turn the neighborhood into a transit hub. It slowly evolved from farmland into what it is today, and during the 1990s dot-com bubble, many tech millionaires, including Craig Newmark of Craigslist, called the area home.",Residents like the neighborhood's friendly vibe and its proximity to Golden Gate Park and other green spaces.,b56727d9-3dee-5875-882e-47c4429d0a22,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/31/realestate/31LIVING-CA-COLE-VALLEY-slide-LFEG/31LIVING-CA-COLE-VALLEY-slide-LFEG-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a5af705c439b3ad1b18e1f8aa6e0823b8b2151d102fca40b72c7152df8de7d28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Trees line the sidewalks at the corner of Grattan Street and Cole Street in Cole Valley.,b56727d9-3dee-5875-882e-47c4429d0a22,N24News/imgs/b56727d9-3dee-5875-882e-47c4429d0a22.jpg,7
Style,The New 30-Something,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/02/style/financial-independence-30s.html,"It's the financial riddle of the 30-something years. How does anyone, even those with a stable, upwardly mobile job, let alone a family, afford to live in places like New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco or Washington, D. C.? The answer: Many are bankrolled, to varying degrees, by their parents. Hold the eye roll and exasperation about millennials and their failure to launch or the gushing of financial resentment for a moment, and consider the unforgiving economics of trying to make it in this country today. Wages have stagnated, while real estate, medical and child care costs have skyrocketed. As one economic analysis concluded recently: ""For Americans under the age of 40, the 21st century has resembled one long recession."" Kimberly Palmer, a personal finance expert for NerdWallet, a consumer finance company and app based in San Francisco, said, ""A lot of 30-somethings are still getting financial help from their parents, if they are lucky enough to take advantage of it. Incomes today are lower than they were for Gen Xers and boomers at the same point in their lives. Plus, many of the millennials graduated into the recession, and when you hit your 30s, there are a lot of lifestyle changes and expenses, like having kids, getting married and buying a house.""

Then there are the free services. Ms. Palmer, who is 39 and lives near Washington, D.C., said that the free 20 to 25 hours of child care she receives every month from her parents contributed to her family's decision to have a third child (Dylan Palmer Dave arrived on Feb. 9). If she were to pay a babysitter, Ms. Palmer estimates it would add up to around $6,000 a year. On average, each millennial parent receives $11,011 per year in combined financial support and unpaid labor, the 2017 TD Ameritrade Millennial Parents Survey found, for an annual total of $253 billion in America. That assistance is crucial for many, according to the study. A quarter of millennial parents receive hourly support from their parents, in the form of child care or household help, and 18 percent of those receiving financial support say they couldn't afford their current lifestyle without it. Over half of these millennial parents (remember that more than a million are becoming mothers every year) say they have a generalized anxiety about not earning enough to support themselves and their families. In cities like New York, where private preschool can cost over $30,000 a year, families need special help footing the bill. ""Education is incredibly expensive and keeps going up, but grandparents feel very strongly about their grandchildren having a good education,"" said Dana Haddad, who runs New York Admissions, an education consultancy that works with children starting at 10 months.

In her practice, Ms. Haddad, a former admissions director at Horace Mann School, estimates that 10 to 15 percent of checks come from grandparents. What it all amounts to is a much different picture, at least in middle-to-upper-class America, from how this age cohort has been viewed in the past. On the television show ""Thirtysomething,"" which aired from 1987 to 1991, the all-white cast of characters seemed to be economically emancipated from their parents, who rarely factored into the story lines. Today's series about 30-somethings portray a decade that seems far less adult, at least by traditional standards. (Think ""Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" or ""New Girl."") Behind the jokes about ""adulting""; the new fashion for referring to male children as ""buddy"" instead of ""son"" (as if still a kid oneself); the performative generational cluelessness about basics like how many towels to own, is a more serious and divisive question:  How they answer portends very different economic outcomes, career paths and life choices. That's if they answer. Despite how common it is for a certain set of affluent millennials to be getting help from their parents at an age when many of them are themselves parents, it's still the last taboo of finance that people don't want to admit, according to Ms. Palmer.

""It's easier to talk about saving more or being frugal,"" she said. ""There's not as much shame around those topics."" While it's true that families with means have always helped their children (discreetly or not), what's different today is that as the economy has more extreme gyrations and wages flatten, family wealth plays an outsize role in helping people get ahead, said Chuck Collins, a scion of the Oscar Mayer food corporation and the author of ""Born on Third Base: A One Percenter Makes the Case for Tackling Inequality, Bringing Wealth Home, and Committing to the Common Good."" Those who do not have parental assistance in their 30s, however, continue to be at a disadvantage. ""They are grappling with paying off student-loan debt, their savings might not be as strong because of that, and many are taking care of other family members,"" said Iimay Ho, 32, the executive director at Resource Generation, an organization that works with people ages 18 to 35 with wealth or class privilege to engage on issues of inequality. Ms. Ho said there was no way she would have been able to amass the $200,000 she has in net assets if her parents, both of whom immigrated from Taiwan to pursue advanced degrees, hadn't paid for tuition at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, given her close to $100,000 toward buying a condo in Washington, D.C., and continue to give her about $10,000 a year. For those without parental cash at the ready, there's often some kind of debt hangover that holds them back in significant ways. Roger Quesada, 34, calls his $65,000 of student-loan debt to Sallie Mae, which incurs $400 a month in interest payments alone, ""a jail sentence."" A lapse in his payments ruined his credit, he said, and has hampered his financial and career aspirations. ""It's been trying to navigate our economy without one of the most important components -- good credit -- that provides enormous advantages and privileges,"" said Mr. Quesada, who grew up working-class in West New York, N.J. ""That's something many in my generation take for granted -- graduating debt free."" They also take for granted, he said, financial advice that ""native parents with an upper hand economically have. I couldn't rely on my mother for anything after I left home. She is retired, disabled, barely scraping by, and depends on Social Security. If anything, I need to be helping her.""

It was important to Mr. Quesada that whatever profession he chose would offer a steady income and growth potential for the future. Settling on e-commerce, he is now a merchandising manager at New Avon, earning six figures, he said. ""I'm the son of an immigrant,"" Mr. Quesada said. ""My life would have been that much harder in Cuba. I feel happy with the success I've had."" He lives with his partner in North Bergen, N.J., where his home cost a fraction of what a comparable property would have in New York City, but came with a commute of over two hours to his office in Manhattan. Those who do receive parental assistance often do not fit neatly into the stereotype of lazy, entitled millennial. Susan Alvarez, 32, makes over $75,000 as the associate executive director at the Y.M.C.A. of San Diego County. ""That is a really decent salary, but it's still not enough to cover a condo,"" she said. So last year Ms. Alvarez's parents surprised her with a $50,000 cash gift to help with a down payment on a $435,000 condo three blocks from the beach in San Diego. ""I grew up middle-class, and my parents immigrated from Cuba,"" she said. ""They saw that I've worked hard but also that I had the bad luck to graduate into the 2008 recession. I didn't get a job that paid well enough and had benefits until I was 23, which meant I missed out on almost two years of earning.""

Evidence suggests that purchasing a home, a life event that many hope to reach in their 30s and one of the primary ways people build wealth, is essentially out of reach in most major cities unless your family has generated a good deal of wealth. (Nationally, homeownership rates are falling for millennials, and only two in 10 have a mortgage or home loan.) Mary Wallace, a real estate agent with Unlimited Sotheby's International Realty in Boston who works primarily with first-home buyers (and is married to Mr. Collins), said that in 20 years she has rarely seen anyone in their 30s who did not have family help or an inheritance for their down payment. ""In our market a buyer is expected to have 20 percent down to compete -- that is between $80,000 and $100,000 to become a homeowner,"" she said. Jessicah Pierre, 27, a media specialist at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, has felt she is on unequal ground. ""A friend was telling me how it wasn't that hard to purchase a home. She was like, 'Do this, do that,'"" said Ms. Pierre, who lives in the Dorchester section of Boston. ""But she wasn't considering the fact that she graduated without any student-loan debt, came from a two-income household, as opposed to me. I am starting with negative wealth because I have loans to pay off and was raised in a family with only one income."" Ms. Pierre's father was an accountant in Haiti and became a cabdriver after immigrating to the United States because his degree wasn't recognized. (She fully expects that she and her two siblings will take care of him in old age.) No one, as Tom Postilio, a real estate agent in New York at Douglas Elliman, put it, wants to post on Instagram: ""'So glad I could move into this apartment that I don't make enough money to buy, but thanks Mom and Dad for the cash.'"" Mr. Postilio estimates that a quarter of his 30-something clients who are buying larger apartments (over two bedrooms) receive money from their parents, whether it's in the form of a gift, a low-interest loan or co-purchasing. But there's a danger in not acknowledging the transfer of wealth (one estimate predicted the boomers will ultimately pass along $30 trillion to their millennial children, whether it's monthly help with living expenses, free child care or receiving the annual gift exclusion of $15,000 from family members). It creates a distorted idea of what it takes to attain success and what financial milestones are actually achievable if you are starting from zero or less.",Have you or haven't you cut the financial cord with your family?,8685453d-4344-5522-8e77-677b241112cb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/03/fashion/03THIRTYSOMETHING1/03THIRTYSOMETHING1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4dfcb4ff6683571fc03f8e1ef733dab5dd981104880e721e1ab260e876fffd77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Golden years: Kimberly Palmer decided to have a third child in part because of the 20 to 25 hours of child care that her parents, Gail Shearer and Chris Palmer, give her each month.",8685453d-4344-5522-8e77-677b241112cb,N24News/imgs/8685453d-4344-5522-8e77-677b241112cb.jpg,15

Jean Kim first spotted her future husband on a chilly day in 2002 at Amherst College. She was on the rooftop terrace of Valentine Hall, a dining facility that was doubling as a dormitory, when she looked out onto the campus grounds and Bryan Woo caught her eye. ""He has this cocky strut,"" Ms. Kim, 33, recalled. ""He was completely bald, he wore this giant puffy jacket and flip flops in the cold. I thought to myself, 'Who is this scary-looking guy?'"" Mr. Woo and Ms. Kim, it turned out, couldn't be more different. He is a New York City native, unnerved by the silent countryside of Amherst, Mass. She acclimated easier coming from a New Jersey suburb. He was private-school educated. She went to public schools her whole life.

At Northern Valley Regional High School at Demarest, N.J., Ms. Kim had a natural aptitude for both academics and athletics. She made the all-state orchestra for violin and the varsity volleyball team, where she helped the team to a state championship her senior year. Although both Mr. Woo and Ms. Kim coincidentally enrolled in the same Japanese Aesthetics class -- he loved anime; she respected the culture -- they interacted mainly because of mutual friends. During their freshman year, Mr. Woo grew close to four of his Delta Kappa Epsilon fraternity brothers, who quickly formed an inseparable crew. Three of them also lived in Valentine Hall, along with Ms. Kim.

""They all looked after me as a little sister, but I was still one of the guys,"" she said. Then, in 2004, Ms. Kim fell between a stairwell banister, fracturing her right wrist and jaw and dislocating her hip. She took the year off to recover. In 2005, Mr. Woo started dating Ms. Kim's friend during his junior year. Upon Ms. Kim's return, the three of them would often spend time together.

Mr. Woo, who had a double major in economics and psychology, returned to New York after graduating in 2006. He traded real estate bonds for NorthStar Realty Finance. Then, in September 2008, he moved to Seoul, South Korea, for a job at Mirae Asset Global Investments. He resided on Yeouido Island, which, coincidentally, was where Ms. Kim's parents and maternal grandparents had at one time lived. Ms. Kim graduated in 2007 with a degree in English, and that summer started a career in marketing analytics at Viacom in Manhattan. She currently works as a senior account manager of the Enthuse Marketing Group. Although both actively dated other people, their approaches were very different. ""Dating was never just fun for me,"" said Ms. Kim, who viewed relationships as a means to finding a potential life partner and settling down. Mr. Woo courted women casually, with relationships lasting from one to six months.

""I was very focused on work,"" Mr. Woo said. As the first son from an accomplished immigrant family, he felt a responsibility to continue his family's success. His father's real estate development firm, Youngwoo & Associates, purchased the AIG towers with Kumho Investment Bank of South Korea for around $140 million in 2009 and won the bid to develop Pier 57 with RXR Realty that same year. After Mr. Woo returned from Seoul in 2010, he became the director of acquisitions at his family's firm. That October, Ms. Kim received an unexpected phone call from Mr. Woo. Eventually they caught up over dinner at BCD Tofu House in Koreatown -- but not before Ms. Kim had tried to reschedule. Mr. Woo insisted on their original date. The reason? His cousin's archery tournament was on the alternate day she had suggested. ""I never expected him to prioritize his baby cousin or family,"" Ms. Kim said. ""That stood out to me."" From then on, their encounters were casual and often in group settings. ""I would ask her about my dating life because she was the only female opinion that I trusted,"" Mr. Woo said. Ms. Kim was in relationships, but Mr. Woo never approved of her suitors.

Nothing romantic transpired (much to those friends' disappointment), but the weekend revealed a different side of Mr. Woo. ""I was surprised that Bryan wanted to get married and have a family,"" Ms. Kim said. ""Until then, I thought he was just a playboy."" Three weeks later, Mr. Woo invited Ms. Kim and some friends to a fund-raiser. When Mr. Woo arrived with a date, Ms. Kim was surprised. ""Three weeks ago, we were consoling each other, saying 'You'll find someone.'"" Upon seeing the other woman, Ms. Kim believed that finding love ""didn't feel like a big dilemma for him."" Eventually the evening progressed to a Chinatown bar, then Mr. Woo's apartment. Once Mr. Woo's date left, his childhood friend, Charles Clinton, became frustrated. ""When you see two people who are in love sometimes it's very obvious,"" Mr. Clinton said.

""Clearly you're in love with Jean,"" Mr. Clinton said to Mr. Woo. ""Just go tell her that."" While Ms. Kim retreated to the restroom, Mr. Woo shooed everyone from his apartment. When she emerged, he confessed his feelings. ""I think I really like you,"" Ms. Kim remembered him saying. Not wanting to hurt their friendship, she replied, ""I think me too."" The next morning, Mr. Woo left for a 10-day business trip. When he returned, he organized a formal ""business meeting"" over dinner at Gaonurri in Koreatown. Despite the risks to their friendship, they decided to give a relationship the old college try. A week later, Mr. Woo planned a romantic getaway to Cold Spring, N.Y. Although both describe the weekend as ""very awkward,"" the butterflies were there. ""I was so giddy,"" Ms. Kim remembered when they held hands.

On New Year's Eve in 2014, Mr. Woo told Ms. Kim he loved her. ""She's such a complement to me,"" Mr. Woo explained. ""She's able to read me and understand my motivations in ways I don't fully comprehend."" One year later, they discussed marriage. On Feb. 10, 2017, Mr. Woo proposed to Ms. Kim at his family's country house in Garrison, N.Y. He surprised Ms. Kim with two stacked bamboo steamers on an outside table. The first contained Ms. Kim's favorite food, dumplings. In the bottom, she discovered a ring box. On April 14, they were married before 260 guests (including Martha Stewart, who is a friend of the groom's family) in the Bronx Post Office. The building holds special significance for Mr. Woo, whose family firm purchased the landmark building in 2014. His parents also met 10 blocks away from the historic site -- his father had delivered rice from a Korean grocery store to his mother's apartment in 1972.

Ms. Kim wore a pale blush, strapless lace dress by Monique Lhuillier. Mr. Woo donned a white tuxedo jacket and black pants by Ermenegildo Zegna. Mr. Clinton, who had prompted his friends to express their love four years ago, became ordained through the Universal Life Church. He officiated alongside his wife, Jacqueline Clinton. The bride's brother, Daniel Kim, read ""Love in Action"" from Romans 12:9-16. After Ms. Kim agreed to take Mr. Woo as her husband, Mrs. Clinton paused, asking: ""Are you sure, Jean?"" Laughter erupted in the room. Ivory and white velour curtains transformed the industrial space, which was finished only days before the wedding, into a romantic setting. After cocktail hour in the historic lobby, the 16-person bridal party emerged into the dimly lit reception area to Michael Jackson's ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough."" During the couple's first dance, Mr. Woo dramatically dipped his wife backward to Etta James crooning ""at last my love has come along."" While guests noshed on branzino, steak and pasta, the groom's brother, He-myong, shared a slide show of Mr. Woo. His Korean name, He-ryong, means bright dragon. For a time, Mr. Woo was pure dragon. Under Ms. Kim's influence, He-myong said he saw his brother's lightness come back. ""Jean isn't the light, but she's a source that brings out that light in him,"" he said.","Friends of Jean Kim and Bryan Woo sensed a special connection between the two, but it took years before the couple began a romance.",ced6922f-4d4a-5965-8de6-2cac5a304978,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/27/style/27VOWS1-alpha/27VOWS1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=f6ae86d3c77728c3edf72d7302b40fc331336ad23826c2448d97827578cd08b1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jean Kim and Bryan Woo, who met in college, were married April 14 at the Bronx Post Office.",ced6922f-4d4a-5965-8de6-2cac5a304978,N24News/imgs/ced6922f-4d4a-5965-8de6-2cac5a304978.jpg,19
Food,A Tabletop Sanctuary,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/dining/dining-table-honest-chops-imam-khalid-latif.html,"Until six months ago, Imam Khalid Latif, a chaplain of the New York Police Department and the executive director of the Islamic Center at New York University, did not own a dining table. With his wife, Priya Chandra, and their daughter, Madina, now 3, he made do with eating on the couch or the floor, just as he had as a bachelor chaplain in residence living in the same N.Y.U. dormitory apartment. An island once stood in the open kitchen, effectively functioning as a hall closet. ""We threw our clothes on the stools,"" Ms. Chandra said. Days before their son, Kareem, was born, with half the apartment under renovation, the table arrived from Macy's. Its particulars (acacia wood, dark rustic finish) mattered less than simply having a place to sit and eat together.

For Imam Latif, 33, it is this intangible, the sense of the dining table as a sanctuary, that he most treasures. ""Being at home,"" he said. ""Eating food made by someone who knows you, who loves you.""

""My relationship to food has been really interesting because it's had a lot to do with my spiritual development,"" he said. He grew up in Edison, N.J., the son of Pakistani immigrants with roots in Kashmir. When he was 10, he brought home a bag of Rice Krispies Treats. His sister informed him that they contained gelatin, which comes from pigs and is thus not halal, or permitted for Muslims. Bewildered, he locked himself in his bedroom and ate the whole bag. They were his last Rice Krispies Treats. Soon after, he gave up marshmallow-strewn Lucky Charms, along with, he said, ""a really, really big part of my heart."" Eventually, he started to eat only zabihah meat, from animals slaughtered in accordance with Islamic law: one quick slash to the throat for as painless a death as possible, done with a blessing. He first witnessed an animal's death when he was a child visiting relatives in Pakistan. A week before Eid al-Fitr (the Muslim feast celebrating the end of Ramadan, a month of fasts), a goat suddenly appeared in his aunt's yard.

At 18, Imam Latif thought he needed to slaughter an animal himself, to understand ""what are the ethics here, what are we really doing."" He went to a farm and found himself standing in front of a goat. ""It was a surreal experience,"" he said. ""You're asking a part of creation to give its life so your life can be sustained."" In 2014, he and two partners opened Honest Chops, an East Village butcher shop devoted to selling meat that is not only zabihah, but also from animals raised humanely. He was shocked to visit farms and see chickens ""so large they can't stand,"" he said. ""They have no feathers on their stomachs."" Last Ramadan, in the spirit of mindful consumption, he decided to relinquish sugar. This proved brutal. ""He was a very angry man,"" Ms. Chandra said, laughing. Gone are the days when he might tweet a photograph of a half-eaten chocolate-chip cookie from a bake sale for the Islamic Center, or air suspicions on Facebook that his wife was ""stealing"" one of his cookies. ""I ate it,"" she admitted. ""That was when I was pregnant."" ""It wasn't just one,"" he said.","For Imam Khalid Latif, a chaplain of the New York Police Department, his dining table provides a haven.",d9ed587a-64f6-56f0-a5a9-291af3a7d93b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/03/dining/03CLOSE_WEB/03CLOSE_WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=0d129922f34ed7d257d1ee11bddc5e4fd2229a379d5b23eb091a15e97ea4e180&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Priya Chandra and Imam Khalid Latif with their son, Kareem.",d9ed587a-64f6-56f0-a5a9-291af3a7d93b,N24News/imgs/d9ed587a-64f6-56f0-a5a9-291af3a7d93b.jpg,17
Opinion,Selfishness in American Society Today,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/03/opinion/letters/selfishness-society.html,"Re ""The Cult of Selfishness Is Killing America,"" by Paul Krugman (column, July 28):

While I agree with the headline, I think the article missed the mark. This is not a Republican or a Democratic issue. It is failure of the broader society. Masks have become political theater, no different from the knocking over of statues or the destruction of private property. Neither the left nor the right is justified in its respective behaviors.

We as Americans have a fundamental right to disagree. We do not have the right to trample on others' property, health, thought process or social well-being. It is a failure of the society at large to peacefully and respectfully disagree. This is not a partisan issue. All of us own this, and it needs to be fixed.

Paul Krugman has been warning us for years about right-wing hypocrisy and the essentially anti-democratic ways of modern-day Republicans, and his take on a ""cult of selfishness"" is once again correct and urgent.

Today's G.O.P. values applied to the virus response can actually be measured in tens of thousands of needless American deaths and, as Mr. Krugman has so often stated, the steady destruction of an America built for the common good.

These genes do not determine intelligence, however. Their combined influence is minuscule, the researchers said, suggesting that thousands more are likely to be involved and still await discovery. Just as important, intelligence is profoundly shaped by the environment. Still, the findings could make it possible to begin new experiments into the biological basis of reasoning and problem-solving, experts said. They could even help researchers determine which interventions would be most effective for children struggling to learn. ""This represents an enormous success,"" said Paige Harden, a psychologist at the University of Texas, who was not involved in the study.

For over a century, psychologists have studied intelligence by asking people questions. Their exams have evolved into batteries of tests, each probing a different mental ability, such as verbal reasoning or memorization. In a typical test, the tasks might include imagining an object rotating, picking out a shape to complete a figure, and then pressing a button as fast as possible whenever a particular type of word appears. Each test-taker may get varying scores for different abilities. But over all, these scores tend to hang together -- people who score low on one measure tend to score low on the others, and vice versa. Psychologists sometimes refer to this similarity as general intelligence. It's still not clear what in the brain accounts for intelligence. Neuroscientists have compared the brains of people with high and low test scores for clues, and they've found a few. Brain size explains a small part of the variation, for example, although there are plenty of people with small brains who score higher than others with bigger brains.

Other studies hint that intelligence has something to do with how efficiently a brain can send signals from one region to another. Danielle Posthuma, a geneticist at Vrije University Amsterdam and senior author of the new paper, first became interested in the study of intelligence in the 1990s. ""I've always been intrigued by how it works,"" she said. ""Is it a matter of connections in the brain, or neurotransmitters that aren't sufficient?"" Dr. Posthuma wanted to find the genes that influence intelligence. She started by studying identical twins who share the same DNA. Identical twins tended to have more similar intelligence test scores than fraternal twins, she and her colleagues found. Hundreds of other studies have come to the same conclusion, showing a clear genetic influence on intelligence. But that doesn't mean that intelligence is determined by genes alone. Our environment exerts its own effects, only some of which scientists understand well. Lead in drinking water, for instance, can drag down test scores. In places where food doesn't contain iodine, giving supplements to children can raise scores. Advances in DNA sequencing technology raised the possibility that researchers could find individual genes underlying differences in intelligence test scores. Some candidates were identified in small populations, but their effects did not reappear in studies on larger groups. So scientists turned to what's now called the genome-wide association study: They sequence bits of genetic material scattered across the DNA of many unrelated people, then look to see whether people who share a particular condition -- say, a high intelligence test score -- also share the same genetic marker.

In 2014, Dr. Posthuma was part of a large-scale study of over 150,000 people that revealed 108 genes linked to schizophrenia. But she and her colleagues had less luck with intelligence, which has proved a hard nut to crack for a few reasons. Standard intelligence tests can take a long time to complete, making it hard to gather results on huge numbers of people. Scientists can try combining smaller studies, but they often have to merge different tests together, potentially masking the effects of genes. As a result, the first generation of genome-wide association studies on intelligence failed to find any genes. Later studies managed to turn up promising results, but when researchers turned to other groups of people, the effect of the genes again disappeared.

""I thought, 'Of course we're not going to find anything,'"" she said. She was wrong. To her surprise, 52 genes emerged with firm links to intelligence. A dozen had turned up in earlier studies, but 40 were entirely new. But all of these genes together account for just a small percentage of the variation in intelligence test scores, the researchers found; each variant raises or lowers I.Q. by only a small fraction of a point. ""It means there's a long way to go, and there are going to be a lot of other genes that are going to be important,"" Dr. Posthuma said. Christopher F. Chabris, a co-author of the new study at Geisinger Health System in Danville, Pa., was optimistic that many of those missing genes would come to light, thanks to even larger studies involving hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of people. ""It's just like astronomy getting better with bigger telescopes,"" he said. In the new study, Dr. Posthuma and her colleagues limited their research to people of European descent because that raised the odds of finding common genetic variants linked to intelligence. But other gene studies have shown that variants in one population can fail to predict what people are like in other populations. Different variants turn out to be important in different groups, and this may well be the case with intelligence. ""If you try to predict height using the genes we've identified in Europeans in Africans, you'd predict all Africans are five inches shorter than Europeans, which isn't true,"" Dr. Posthuma said.

Studies like the one published today don't mean that intelligence is fixed by our genes, experts noted. ""If we understand the biology of something, that doesn't mean we're putting it down to determinism,"" Dr. Ritchie said. As an analogy, he noted that nearsightedness is strongly influenced by genes. But we can change the environment -- in the form of eyeglasses -- to improve people's eyesight. Dr. Harden predicted that an emerging understanding of the genetics of intelligence would make it possible to find better ways to help children develop intellectually. Knowing people's genetic variations would help scientists measure how effective different strategies are. Still, Dr. Harden said, we don't have to wait for such studies to change people's environments for the better. ""We know that lead harms children's intellectual abilities,"" she said. ""There's low-hanging policy fruit here."" For her part, Dr. Posthuma wants to make sense of the 52 genes she and her colleagues discovered. There are intriguing overlaps between their influence on intelligence and on other traits. The genetic variants that raise intelligence also tend to pop up more frequently in people who have never smoked. Some of them also are found more often in people who take up smoking but quit successfully. As for what the genes actually do, Dr. Posthuma can't say. Four of them are known to control the development of cells, for example, and three do an assortment of things inside neurons.

To understand what makes these genes special, scientists may need to run experiments on brain cells. One possibility would be to take cells from people with variants that predict high and low intelligence. She and her colleagues might coax them to develop into neurons, which could then grow into ""mini-brains"" -- clusters of neurons that exchange signals in the laboratory. Researchers could then see if their genetic differences made them behave differently. ""We can't do it overnight,"" Dr. Posthuma said, ""but it's something I hope to be able to do in the future.""","The genes account for just a tiny fraction of the variation in test scores, experts say.

Style,Why Saving the Oceans Is as Vital as Protecting Rain Forests,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/23/style/ayana-elizabeth-johnson-climate-ocean.html,"Saving the oceans is key to fighting the climate crisis, according to Ayana Elizabeth Johnson, a Brooklyn-born marine biologist and activist, who is a rising figure in the climate movement. Dr. Johnson, 39, is the founder of Ocean Collectiv, a conservation consultancy, and of Urban Ocean Lab, a think tank, and speaks frequently at TED Talks, climate rallies and her salons at Pioneer Works in Brooklyn. Protecting the ocean is crucial for people at all economic levels, she said, not just bicoastal elites who look down their noses at plastic straws. You have talked a lot about how the oceans are crucial in the fight against climate change. How so? When people talk about the destruction of the Amazon, and how forests in general are the lungs of the planet, I always want to jump in and say the ocean is a huge part of that, too. Phytoplankton -- these tiny little plants in the ocean -- produce a huge percentage of the oxygen we breathe, and the population of phytoplankton is declining. That should be a cause for concern for every single person.

You hear a lot of talk about plastic straws. Is that issue really a big deal or is it greenwashing? Straws are not the biggest problem facing the ocean, but they are an opportunity to think about what else we can do to reduce our impact on the planet. It really cracked me up the other day. I was walking down the street in Fort Greene, the neighborhood where I grew up and where I live now, and I saw this guy looking super-stylish carrying an iced coffee in a plastic to-go coffee cup with a plastic lid, and I turned to look, and he's got a metal straw in the cup. Part of me wanted to just hit it out of his hand and be like, ""Dude, you're totally missing the point! If you're going to bring a straw, just bring your own cup!"" Some of those straws, I guess, can end up in the ""Great Pacific Garbage Patch."" Are there any steps we can take to tackle that? I kind of recoil at this question, to be honest, because I feel like this has been done a million times: carry your own water bottle, carry your own grocery bags. But I think there is a harder answer, which is that it does actually require some sacrifice.

Like I'll be walking down the street and I want to get a Juice Press because I'm hungry and I didn't bring enough snacks for the day, and I don't. There is an element of: ""Don't buy the thing that's in plastic."" There's no cute answer, right? Nothing that is disposable can be sustainable. The United Nations says that 93 percent of commercial fish stocks are being fished at or beyond capacity. What kind of fish should we avoid eating? Pending changes which could come at any moment, the U.S. still does a very good job of managing our fish population. So eat U.S. seafood and support your fishermen who are doing it right. And eat lower on the food chain. Instead of tuna, eat sardines and anchovies -- those little ones that are reproducing super-quickly. Because tuna is so far up the food chain, if we were eating the land equivalent of tuna, it would be like eating whatever kind of dragon eats a lion. It's this incredible beast, and we will never be able to have sustainable tuna fishing at scale.

But ocean farming of shellfish -- oysters, mussels and clams -- and seaweed is super-sustainable, and we should all be eating more of those things because they actually just live off of nutrients in the water and sunlight. In fact, eating shellfish like oysters can be more sustainable than being totally vegan, because it's just such an efficient and low-carbon way to make protein. Shellfish are absorbing carbon as they're making their shells. And seaweed is absorbing tons of CO2, because they're plants. Some people think ocean conservation is an elitist issue for people with beach houses. Why does it matter for people across the economic spectrum? It's no coincidence which communities bear the brunt of sea level rise, pollution and strengthened storms. Along the coasts, it's poor communities and communities of color who are most at risk. It's those who already have the fewest resources who are most in danger, not people with vacation homes and yachts. Ocean conservation is a social justice issue. Climate change deniers like to paint conservation as a pet cause for limousine liberals. It's so easy to think about the typical environmentalist as this stereotype of a fit white guy stepping out of a Prius, looking out into the mountains wearing a Patagonia jacket. But I've looked into the polling data, and that's completely false. It's young people, and it's people of color, and it's women who disproportionately care about environmental and climate issues, and are most supportive of stronger government policies to address them. Sixty-eight percent of people of color say they are worried about the impacts of climate change, compared to 55 percent of white people.

Do you see the green movement forging stronger ties to the social justice movement? I mean, Black Lives Matter has a part of their platform that's about climate and the environment, because it is a justice issue. If you think about the rates of asthma in inner-city communities that are near power plants or exposed to other types of pollution, it's a lot higher. And when we think about immigration, and how a lot of migration is now driven by climate change, whether it's droughts and crop failures or the impacts of storms, that becomes a social justice issue that was triggered by the impacts on communities that did the least to emit the carbon to cause the problem. That's a lot of bad news to take in. What's the biggest reason for hope? Nature is super-resilient if we give it a chance, right? If we stop polluting the ocean, it will be less polluted. If we stop overfishing, in most cases, fish populations will recover. The ocean has already absorbed about 30 percent of the excess CO2 that we've trapped by burning fossil fuels. And the ocean has already absorbed 93 percent of the heat that we've trapped. And so the ocean is trying its best to buffer us from our worst, right? We need to return the favor.

Fashion & Style,Dark Days,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/08/fashion/aids-new-york-fashion-week-history.html,"It was 1983. It was New York. The New York Times had published the ""gay cancer"" story. Panic ensued. One day, it was a party. The next day you were afraid to kiss someone on the street. Then it became apparent that the cancer wasn't going away, it was getting worse. People started dying. I was born in 1968. My coming-of-age story happened in the middle of the AIDS epidemic. I was graduating from F.I.T. and matriculating into an industry that was ravaged. As gay men, many of us who worked in fashion, we were very conscious that we had lost a generation: incredible artists, industry leaders and moguls. They were gone. I was angry, everyone was angry. People were dying. It was one big, horrific lottery. AIDS left a big crater. To a fashion world that had seemed so Teflon-impervious -- the New York of the '70s was all Studio 54, glamour and Halston -- its impact was enormous. ""Who is next?"" was the question on all our lips.

I went to the clinic with a friend of mine to get tested. It took a while to get your results back. The two of us went in, and the doctors came up to me and said: ""We'd like to talk to you. We need to go into a private room."" That's when my knees buckled. I thought, ""That's it."" But it turned out that they talked to everybody in a private room. I was lucky. The friend that I went there with was not as lucky. If you were gay, you didn't always say so. Being openly gay could have threatened your social life or career. People were terrified of touching gay men, kissing gay men.

People had always thought of fashion as a very superficial industry, a models-and-parties business. That changed. Outside the industry, people started to realize when they ordered something from a catalog, that the copywriter, the photographer, the man who produces the paper it's printed on, the man who delivers the mail, they are all part of the fashion ecosystem. Inside fashion, a sense of community became more important. AIDS galvanized us. Fern Mallis saw the need for us to stand together as an industry. Loosely and abstractly, the rise of the tents in Bryant Park was tied to the loss of so many people.

My worry over the years has been that these big names and small names, the famous and the infamous, all the young people who were just taking their stride would be forgotten. It's like the Second World War. If it's something you didn't go through yourself, it seems a little abstract. People died, and the cause was not acknowledged. When Perry Ellis died, I don't think it was disclosed that he died of AIDS. It was never revealed that Halston died of AIDS.

All those people perished, and now many young people maybe don't even know that Perry Ellis was an actual person. Many young African-American designers would be inspired to know how many great African-Americans had careers at the time. These people didn't all just get on a bus and drive off somewhere. They died excruciating deaths, some in the hallways of hospitals without help or support. In many instances, their families rejected them. I distinctly remember people who didn't have a funeral or memorial. I had a friend who was buried in an unmarked grave. It's always troubled me that these supertalented original thinkers weren't adequately memorialized. I named them in ""The Asylum"" [Mr. Doonan's 2013 fashion memoir].

They were Patrick Kelly, Angel Estrada, Isaia, Clovis Ruffin, Halston, Antonio Lopez and Juan Ramos, Tina Chow, Tim Hawkins, Robert Hayes and Laughlin Barker. And the photographers: David Seidner, Barry McKinley, Herb Ritts, Bill King and so many more. They were window-dresser friends: Bob Currie, Michael Cipriano, Bob Benzio, Stephen Di Petrie. The list goes on. Linda Fargo [now the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman] and I were working in those days in the back rooms of the display world. We have a certain amount of survivor's guilt. I came into Barneys and did the holiday windows in the mid-1980s, the year after Stephen Di Petrie had done them. If those people hadn't died, our careers wouldn't have happened.

In the late '80s, we met with Carolyne Roehm, who was president of the C.F.D.A. By that time, the specter of AIDS had begun to crystallize and connect the fashion industry in a very powerful way. We asked, could we do something big and fabulous? But they had their own agenda. Those conversations gave rise in November 1990 to the first 7th on Sale AIDS benefit at the 26th Street Armory. Calvin, Ralph and Donna were the chairs, along with Anna Wintour. It was a spectacular event. Robert Isabel did the design of the armory: gossamer fabrics hanging from the rafters, flowers everywhere. Every designer had his own booth, virtually giving away clothes at wholesale prices. The crisis instilled in us a sense of banding together to see how did we conquer this terrible plague. When the tents went up, that reinforced our sense of community. The tents became the heartbeat of the industry.",The devastating impact of AIDS on the fashion community.,1fa79867-9255-5b24-969d-fd5a97c795bd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/08/fashion/08DARK-HALSTON-WEB/08DARK-HALSTON-WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=d072121a95cf4edf7a201a4886ca98f9b56fae22e9196b09ae8acf379f185cc7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The designer Halston celebrates after a fashion show on in 1973.,1fa79867-9255-5b24-969d-fd5a97c795bd,N24News/imgs/1fa79867-9255-5b24-969d-fd5a97c795bd.jpg,19
Television,Laura Harrier on Rewriting Hollywood in Netflix's 'Hollywood',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/arts/television/hollywood-laura-harrier-netflix.html,"Set in the 1940s, the series envisions an alternate history for women of color in the movies. Harrier talked about what she learned from the role -- and what it was like to wear those amazing clothes.

This interview contains spoilers for the series finale of ""Hollywood."" Laura Harrier was in high school when she first learned about the Oscar-nominated actress Dorothy Dandridge, and she was immediately drawn to her beauty and talent. So when Ryan Murphy cast her in ""Hollywood"" as Camille, a 1940s starlet inspired by Dandridge, it ""felt like a gift had fallen from the sky,"" she said. Inhabiting the role, however, meant tapping into experiences very different from her own. She had earned acclaim for breaking racial barriers as a love interest in the blockbuster ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" The pioneering black actresses of Dandridge's generation had to face cross-burnings and boycotts. In order to play a woman like them, Harrier looked to their lives and films for inspiration. ""I also drew a lot from Lena Horne,"" she said in a phone interview just ahead of the series debut. (All seven episodes arrived to Netflix last week.) ""I looked at both of them to understand what it felt like to have a dream to be a leading lady and yet have nobody to look to onscreen."" ""It's not like when I was growing up and could look at Halle Berry, Angela Bassett, Nia Long and Jada Pinkett Smith,"" she added.

Finding herself in Camille's perfectly polished heels was a process that began with a cryptic audition for an untitled project about a year ago, followed by several months of radio silence. One day, she was brought in for a chemistry read with her co-star and executive producer Darren Criss, and the next, she received a call informing her that she had been cast. It all happened so fast, but Harrier was excited for the challenge. ""When Ryan Murphy asks you to do something, you don't say no,"" she said. Harrier was then thrust back in time more than 70 years to play a woman quietly fighting the system -- much as women like Dandridge and Horne had to fight in their day. She immersed herself in their world and transformed herself on set, down to the impeccably tailored outfits, the coifed curls and the internalized discrimination. ""It really felt like I had lived in the 1940s for about five months,"" Harrier said. ""It was very cool, but it was funny going back to real life.""

""This revisionist history of Hollywood makes me think about what it would have been like today had this happened back then,"" she said. Back in the present day, from her adopted home of Los Angeles, the Chicago native reflected on her whirlwind ride on ""Hollywood."" Several weeks into the pandemic quarantine, Harrier was ""grateful,"" she said, to have a house and a backyard where she could chat by phone about what still makes her happy: movies, fashion, inspiring the next generation and rewriting Hollywood history. These are edited excerpts from that conversation. Besides the Ryan Murphy factor, what drew you to the project and Camille's story? I was really interested in telling a story of old Hollywood that was different than we've seen previously. As an actress and someone who loves film, I loved living in that era. It's so glamorous and beautiful. But growing up as a black woman, I never saw myself represented. So, it was something that I admired, but never fully connected to. Getting to tell a black woman's story really excited me. As glamorous and victorious as the series is at times, it's also bittersweet and heartbreaking because black women like Camille never got their due in real life. How did you strike that balance in tone? Yeah, there's such a heaviness to that period against the backdrop of World War II. It's the antithesis of what we're used to seeing onscreen. We're also looking at the stories of real people who led really tragic lives. I really wanted to examine it more deeply through their lens.

Since you're not playing a real-life person, did you have more leeway to add to the portrayal? I was definitely able to build Camille and make her her own character. But my research started with Dorothy Dandridge, who was a very similar figure. She was so talented, intelligent and beautiful, and had quite a bit of success. But she hit a glass ceiling and was never fully celebrated for the artist that she was. She was oversexualized and occasionally cast in racist roles. I watched a bunch of her movies and listened to podcasts. I wish I had known about her when I was a little girl. It would have inspired me as a young girl to see someone like her so early on.

I felt a sense of hopelessness watching Camille help try to get a film like ""Meg"" made, knowing that it could never have happened. It was easier for me to digest the penultimate episode, when the film is burned, than the triumphant finale. Maybe I'm just conditioned to unhappier endings. I was in the same boat as you when I read that penultimate episode. It's horrible, but it's also unfortunately been the history of people who've been marginalized in Hollywood to not have happy endings or achieve success. I really loved that Ryan, Ian, Janet [Janet Mock, an executive producer, writer and director] and all the writers made it a celebration of happiness and hope. There's often been criticism of revisionist history onscreen and how it can sometimes sanitize the way things really were. Were you ever worried about that? I wouldn't say that it was something that I was concerned about, given the people that I was working with and their body of work. I know that they have always been on the right side of things. Ryan has been such a pioneer in representation and escapism that is also grounded in reality. The costumes in the series also show such respect for each character -- regardless of race, class, gender and age. How did they help you authenticate who Camille is?

As soon as I put on the costumes, the hair and the red lipstick, as well as the silk slip and garters, it changed the way I walked, my posture and how I carried myself. Camille had respect for her clothing and understood the importance of being put together. She knew what it conveyed at a time when people of color were not universally respected by society and the powers that be. It was really important for Camille because she was going into the studio system as the only black girl. So she had to be a beautiful, glamorous version of herself to show the world that she belongs here.","Set in the 1940s, the series envisions an alternate history for women of color in the movies.

Opinion,Pakistan's Most Terrifying Adversary Is Climate Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/27/opinion/pakistan-climate-change.html,"Karachi is home. My bustling, chaotic city of about 20 million people on the Arabian Sea is an ethnically and religiously diverse metropolis and the commercial capital of Pakistan, generating more than half of the country's revenue. Over the decades, Karachi has survived violent sectarian strife, political violence between warring groups claiming the city and terrorism. Karachi has survived its gangsters sparring with rocket launchers; its police force, more feared than common criminals; its rulers and bureaucrats committed to rapacious, bottomless corruption. Now Karachi faces its most terrifying adversary: climate change. In August, Karachi's stifling summer heat was heavy and pregnant. The sapodilla trees and frangipani leaves were lush and green; the Arabian Sea, quiet and distant, had grown muddy. When the palm fronds started to sway, slowly, the city knew the winds had picked up and rain would follow. Every year the monsoons come -- angrier and wilder -- lashing the unprepared city. Studies show that climate change is causing monsoons to be more intense and less predictable, and cover larger areas of land for longer periods of time. On Aug. 27, Karachi received nearly nine inches of monsoon rain, the highest amount of rainfall ever in a single day. Nineteen inches of rain fell in August, according to the meteorological officials. It is enough to drown a city that has no functioning drainage, no emergency systems and no reliable health care (except for those who can pay). Thousands of homes and settlements of the poor were subsumed and destroyed, and more than 100 people were killed.

A traders association estimated that the submerging of markets and warehouses damaged goods worth 25 billion Pakistani rupees, or about $150 million. Local papers estimated that with Karachi at a standstill for a week, in some congested areas for longer, Pakistan's gross domestic product suffered daily losses of $449 million -- a number that didn't include the enormous informal economy. The World Bank estimates that 15 percent of gross domestic product of the Sindh province (Karachi is its capital) is lost every year to environmental damage and climate change. Pakistan is the fifth most climate vulnerable nation in the world. Between 1998 and 2018, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, the country is estimated to have lost nearly 10,000 lives to climate-related disasters and suffered losses amounting to about $4 billion from 152 extreme weather events in that period. Analysts have estimated Pakistan's climate migrants over the past decade at around 30 million people.

There is no end to the catalog of climate disasters affecting my country. The glaciers in the Hindu Kush, the Himalayas and the Karakoram in northern Pakistan are melting at an accelerated pace. If the emission trends and temperature rises continue unabated, these mountains could lose between a third to two-thirds of their ice fields by 2100. The result will be catastrophic: By 2050, the increased melting will result in landslides, heavy flooding, dam bursts and soil erosion. After the glaciers have melted away, drought and famine will follow. The terror of our coming era will be born of heat and fire and ice. Some years ago, I was in a village in Sindh after a massive flood had devastated it. Thousands were displaced overnight. The blistering heat soaked the faces of displaced young women in sweat thick like glycerin.

Global Business,Europe Says Tests Show Horse Meat Scandal Is 'Food Fraud',https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/business/global/european-study-affirms-role-of-fraud-in-horsemeat-scandal.html,"LONDON -- Two months after a horse meat scandal first gripped Europe, tests conducted by European Union countries showed on Tuesday that France had found the most beef products containing horse DNA, while Britain had detected the most traces of a painkiller banned from the human food chain. Results from more than 7,000 tests carried out by the 27 countries in the union found horse DNA in about 5 percent of samples, while phenylbutazone, the banned drug used as an equine painkiller, was discovered in about 0.5 percent of samples. The figures, published by the European Commission, gave the first detailed picture of the extent of the problem. Tonio Borg, the European commissioner for health and consumer policy, said the findings showed that it was ""a matter of food fraud and not of food safety.""

But he added in an e-mail statement: ""Restoring the trust and confidence of European consumers and trading partners in our food chain following this fraudulent labeling scandal is now of vital importance for the European economy, given that the food sector is the largest single economic sector"" in the European Union. Mr. Borg said the commission would propose new regulations in the coming months. The scandal led to products worth millions of euros being withdrawn from stores. It has also highlighted the inability of producers to guarantee the ingredients in processed meat products. Because the statistics were supplied by food safety authorities in individual nations, which sampled different numbers of beef products, there was not sufficient data to make comprehensive comparisons. France, however, tested 353 products labeled beef, of which 47 contained horse DNA; Greece tested 288 products and found horse meat in 36; and Germany tested 878 samples and detected horse meat in 29. Britain found the highest level of the equine painkiller -- in 14 of 836 samples.

The animal rights organization maintains a 29-page list of other drugs given to horses in the United States that either are a threat to or have not been tested for their impact on human health. The European Union, for example, bans from meat production animals treated with thyrostats, which are licensed for use in horses for respiratory infections but also to promote the growth of lean tissue.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations.
* Netflix buys a visual effects company in a move to support its global ambitions. Another example, Firocoxib, is specifically labeled, ""Do not use in horses intended for human consumption."" Veterinarians in the United States recommend it to treat or prevent inflammation in horses. ""The European Union has failed to seek tests for a whole host of other banned veterinary drugs which are commonly administered to horses and is thereby failing the public by allowing meat from those animals to be sold in the European Union in contravention of its own food safety and consumer protection regulations,"" the Humane Society said in a statement. The program of tests was agreed to after the discovery of horse meat in frozen lasagna in February. The maker of the lasagna, Findus, said it withdrew the product after Comigel, its French supplier, raised concerns about the type of meat used. Meatballs sold by Ikea were also withdrawn. Over all, the European Commission said 7,259 tests were conducted. In all, 193 tests, or 4.66 percent, revealed traces of horse DNA, and 16 showed positive traces of the painkiller, equivalent to 0.51 percent of the samples, the commission said. The findings increased pressure for tighter regulation of the food industry. Though rules require fresh beef to be labeled with its origin, these do not apply to processed products.","Analyses of more than 7,000 samples turned up horse DNA in about 5 percent of samples and traces of an equine painkiller not approved for human consumption.",b335b1ae-c9b7-54bc-91d2-c2a5fc25fc67,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/17/business/17-HORSE/17-HORSE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=7c952a16542754eb07a8f850276aab60ea2c9be35f2cabaf2ade9b1dcc2d2ea8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"A sample of lasagna.

Theater,'West Side Story' Stalemate: Bernardo's Staying. So Are Protesters.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/19/theater/west-side-story-amar-ramasar.html,"A half-hour before the start of ""West Side Story,"" two dozen protesters outside the Broadway Theater inched closer to the production's turf. Blocked by parked cars from their usual spot in the street, they instead occupied the sidewalk alongside ticket holders, many of whom looked quizzically at the demonstrators' signs and fliers. ""Hey hey, ho ho, Ramasar has got to go,"" they chanted, as they have on several other nights outside the show, referring to Amar Ramasar, a ""West Side Story"" cast member who was fired, and then reinstated, at New York City Ballet after sending sexually explicit photos of his girlfriend to another dancer. The protesters object to his casting in the show, in which he is playing Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks street gang, a high-profile role that involves a lot of strutting across the stage with an air of machismo, and, at times, lust. Mr. Ramasar's critics assert that his inclusion in the cast is inappropriate given his previous behavior.

But the show has made it clear that Mr. Ramasar is staying. ""There is zero consideration being given to his potentially being terminated from this workplace,"" it said in a statement last week. In the run-up to the show's opening on Thursday, the protesters have proven to be a mild but persistent irritant for the production, a reinterpretation of the classic musical with a modern flair. This cast is populated largely by young people of color. The director, Ivo van Hove, is known for his experimental work. Mini dresses have replaced full skirts. Smartphones are whipped out to record police abuses. And the #MeToo-era demonstrations outside are also similarly and strikingly of the moment, as they reflect the continuing debate over what sort of careers should be left to the men accused of sexual misconduct. Should they be allowed to flourish in new roles? Is there a waiting period during which they must remain in the shadows? Since #MeToo prompted a cultural reckoning, men like Louis C.K. and Aziz Ansari have begun to re-establish their professional lives, while other public figures accused of more severe acts have seen their prospects buried -- likely for good.

""It's shocking to me that these protests are still happening,"" said Alexa Maxwell, Mr. Ramasar's girlfriend. She recently came out publicly as the City Ballet dancer in photographs that Mr. Ramasar sent to a male company member. Declaring herself ""not a victim,"" she asked for the protesters to stand down. On the other side is Alexandra Waterbury, a former student of the School of American Ballet, who accused Chase Finlay, a City Ballet dancer at the time who had been her boyfriend, in 2018, of sharing explicit photos of her with Mr. Ramasar and others without her consent. In a lawsuit, Ms. Waterbury accused Mr. Ramasar of sending Mr. Finlay photos of a different dancer, whom Ms. Maxwell identified as herself. Mr. Finlay resigned from the company; Mr. Ramasar and another dancer were fired, but an arbitrator later ruled that their dismissals were too harsh a punishment. One person who followed the case closely was Paige Levy, a senior at LaGuardia High School in Manhattan, who stands outside the theater some nights, protesting Mr. Ramasar's inclusion in the musical. As an aspiring actress at a performing arts school, she had twice seen ""Carousel,"" Mr. Ramasar's Broadway debut in 2018. After the scandal, she had assumed he wouldn't be appearing again on a Broadway stage any time soon. ""Imagine my surprise when I saw he was being cast in a principal role in a high-profile Broadway show,"" Ms. Levy said.

As the protests progressed, Mr. Ramasar met with cast members twice so they could air any grievances they might have had. Then, last week, he pinned a letter to the call board in the theater, where the production posts official notices for company members. ""It breaks my heart that a terrible mistake I made two years ago has caused a situation that is distracting from the work you are all doing here with such selflessness,"" Mr. Ramasar's letter said. ""I want you to know that my past is not my present."" After the letter was posted, Mr. Ramasar met again with a small group of company members -- including dancers, crew members and orchestra members -- to address any remaining questions, said Mr. Ramasar's lawyer, Lance J. Gotko. Mr. Ramasar has enjoyed unwavering support from the production's management, which last week said that the incident involving Mr. Ramasar occurred at a different workplace and had been ""fully adjudicated."" The production noted in a statement that it does not, as a practice, terminate an employee without cause.

And Mr. Ramasar, it said, was performing the role of Bernardo ""brilliantly"" and would continue to do so ""for the entire unabated length of his agreement."" Given the protests, a spokesman for the show, Rick Miramontez, said that the production has hired a cybersecurity firm to meet with actors who were concerned for their own safety and to prevent any online harassment. Ms. Levy said she and others planned to continue demonstrating to educate ticket holders, many of whom are unaware of the dispute. Last Thursday, as protesters chanted, a middle-aged man en route to the show said he did not know what the demonstration was about. One of the protesters told him that a cast member had ""sexually assaulted"" someone, an overstatement of the sort that Ms. Maxwell said led her to decide to publicly defend Mr. Ramasar. Mr. Gotko, Mr. Ramasar's lawyer, complained that the protesters were ""tossing off words and phrases like they have no meaning whatsoever.""

""Yes, sharing photos can be viewed as a lesser offense than holding someone down behind a dumpster,"" she said. ""It's a different magnitude, but at the same time, my body was violated."" So far the protests do not appear to have a substantial impact on the show's box office. The revival, with Scott Rudin as lead producer, has been selling well. According to figures released Tuesday by the Broadway League, it grossed a healthy $1.5 million during the week that ended Feb. 16; the average ticket price was $110. Asked about the protests on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" on Sunday, Mr. Rudin explained his position bluntly. ""I think what he did was really stupid,"" Mr. Rudin said of Mr. Ramasar. ""Am I supposed to replace him in the show? I'm not going to do that."" ""Yes, actually,"" Ms. Waterbury said in a separate interview, ""that's exactly what you're supposed to do.""",What is the proper punishment for #MeToo-era infractions?

Theater,'Hamilton' Is Coming to the Super Bowl,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/27/theater/super-bowl-pregame-hamilton-schuyler-sisters.html,"The Schuyler Sisters are singing at the Super Bowl.

The National Football League said Friday that Phillipa Soo, Renee Elise Goldsberry and Jasmine Cephas Jones, the actresses who originated the roles of Eliza, Angelica and Peggy Schuyler in ""Hamilton,"" would reunite to perform ""America the Beautiful"" during the televised pregame show.

The three women are popular among fans of the Broadway musical -- at the annual BroadwayCon gathering of theater fans, now underway in New York, some people dress as the characters, and at a recent Sotheby's auction of Hamilton family documents there was particular interest in correspondence involving the sisters. (Eliza, of course, married Alexander Hamilton, and, after his death in a duel, became a champion of his legacy; Angelica was a confidante of both Alexander and Eliza.)

None of the actresses is still in the show's cast. Ms. Soo is preparing to star in the title role of a new Broadway musical, ""Amelie,"" which begins previews March 9; Ms. Goldsberry, who won a Tony award for her performance in ""Hamilton,"" is now working on the Netflix series ""Altered Carbon,"" and Ms. Jones has filmed appearances in ""Girls"" and ""Blood Surf.""

Health,Weak Reporting System Let Risky Surgical Device Stay in Use,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/health/morcellator-gao-report-fda.html,"Doctors and hospitals failed to tell the Food and Drug Administration about cases in which cancer was spread around inside women's bodies by a surgical tool used to operate on the uterus, according to a report issued on Wednesday by the Government Accountability Office. Scattering cancer cells worsens the disease and decreases a patient's chances of long-term survival. Because information was lacking, the tool, called a power morcellator, was widely used for more than 20 years before the F.D.A. acted to limit it, after being alerted to the problem in 2013 by a patient who was harmed. The device, with a spinning blade that shreds tissue, was by then being used in at least 50,000 women a year in the United States to help remove benign uterine tumors called fibroids, or to remove the entire uterus. It had become a mainstay in minimally invasive surgery, slicing up tissue so it could be removed through tiny incisions. But some women with fibroids have undiagnosed cancers, and morcellation can spray malignant cells around inside the abdomen and pelvis like seeds, ""upstaging"" the disease to a more advanced and deadly form.

Before 2013, the F.D.A. had received no reports of uterine cancers being disseminated by morcellators. But after the 2013 case, which was widely covered by the news media, reports began to pour in, and by September 2016 there were 285. Some of the women have died. The government report points out a major flaw in the system for detecting harm from drugs and devices like morcellators: It is passive, relying on ""adverse event"" reports to the F.D.A. from doctors, hospitals, drug and equipment manufacturers, and consumers. But doctors and hospital officials told investigators with the accountability office that before November 2014, when the F.D.A. explicitly stated that cancer spread after morcellation was an adverse event that had to be reported, they would not have regarded it that way or reported it. Previously, they had thought adverse events from surgical tools were related mainly to failures of the device itself. And in the cancer cases, the morcellators were doing exactly what they were supposed to do -- slicing up tissue. ""The passive reporting of adverse events is a weak system,"" Marcia Crosse, the director for health care at the accountability office, said in an interview. In a written statement, the food and drug agency said that it agreed with the report's findings and that ""the F.D.A. has noted the shortcomings of the current passive postmarket surveillance system and has been taking steps to establish a better system to evaluate device performance in clinical practice.""

But the findings have landed just as the Trump administration has suggested that drug and device regulations should be loosened, not tightened. Dr. Crosse said one remedy might be for the F.D.A. to take a more active role in finding cases, by reviewing hospital records for problems that should have been reported but were not, and by mining huge amounts of data for rare conditions that may be warning signs. ""But those things are expensive,"" she said. ""They require data systems that are not currently in place. And it's not clear how much faster or how many more problems would be turned up. But right now they are in the position of having to wait for these things to be filed."" Morcellators are still available, but their use in fibroid surgery has fallen considerably. In November 2014 the F.D.A. said the devices should no longer be used in ""the vast majority"" of women having fibroid surgery. Morcellators came onto the market in 1991 via an F.D.A. process known as 510(k), in which devices are cleared for use without going through the usual lengthy approval process, because they are similar to devices that have already been approved. The morcellators for uterine surgery were cleared because the F.D.A. considered them similar to tools used in minimally invasive knee operations and other orthopedic surgery -- even though the orthopedic equipment had not been used inside the abdomen or pelvis, or for cancer. The F.D.A. knew when it first allowed morcellators for uterine surgery that there was a chance the devices could spew hidden tumors around. But the risk was thought to be small, with one in 500 to one in 10,000 women who had fibroids also having undetected cancer. Subsequent research found the risk was greater, about one in 350. The problem came to light in 2013 when Dr. Amy Reed, then 40, an anesthesiologist and the mother of six children, had her uterus removed because of fibroids at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. A biopsy after the operation found a hidden sarcoma, an aggressive type of cancer. Morcellation had spread the tumor, transforming it to advanced, Stage 4 cancer.","Doctors and hospitals failed to tell the Food and Drug Administration about women whose cancer was spread by a surgical tool, a new report finds.",4720c4f3-09e0-5c26-9443-80c1147d29f6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/09/us/09SURGERY1/09SURGERY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cdc5ce01880636f7e08f52759aa98b188004f7f64aab5777922cb5868a04f5de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A family photograph from October provided by Dr. Hooman Noorchashm, second from back left, with his wife, Dr. Amy Reed, second from back right, and their six children at a ""Slay Sarcoma"" fund-raiser at the University of Pennsylvania.",4720c4f3-09e0-5c26-9443-80c1147d29f6,N24News/imgs/4720c4f3-09e0-5c26-9443-80c1147d29f6.jpg,1

Attendees were aghast at the exchange, and Mr. Bonderman later apologized.

""I appreciate David doing the right thing for Uber at this time of critical cultural changes at the company,"" Ms. Huffington said in a statement.

Art & Design,3 Art Gallery Shows to See Right Now,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/19/arts/design/3-art-gallery-shows-to-see-right-now.html,"The nine works anchoring Lisa Alvarado's solo show, ""Thalweg,"" at Bridget Donahue aren't definitively one thing or another. They're paintings: brightly colored and abstract, with geometric patterns or expressionistic swaths. They're also tapestries suspended from the ceiling, with fabric backing and trim. Notably, each one is titled ""Thalweg (Traditional Object),"" after a geological term that has multiple meanings, too, including a line that traces the lowest part of a valley or channel. Visually, they evoke natural elements like water and earth while referring to a number of traditions, among them Mexican textiles and European and American Modernist painting. But they borrow from and build on those sources to become something of their own. Hybridity and in-betweenness are central to Ms. Alvarado's practice. In addition to being a visual artist, she plays harmonium for the Natural Information Society, a group founded by her husband, Joshua Abrams, that fuses styles to make experimental, meditative music. Her hanging works take on yet another identity as set pieces for their performances.

At Bridget Donahue, the band supplies a droning, transportive audio piece that features the sound of running water -- a motif that appears visually in four collages of Ms. Alvarado's family photos, showing people of Mexican descent in Texas in the 1930s. Around that time, the U.S. government forcibly deported over a million people, many of them American citizens -- including members of the artist's family -- to Mexico, in an act that's euphemistically called ""repatriation.""

It's not really fair to compare Luc Sante's new collages to his better-known writing, since he started making zine covers and wheatpaste posters a good five decades ago. But while taking a long break from visual art, he got famous as a social historian: In books like ""The Other Paris"" and ""Low Life,"" about New York, the Belgian-born critic and professor strings together extraordinary quantities of striking detail about poverty, crime and gutter nightlife in what is, after all, a virtuosic kind of collage in its own right. In his first ever gallery appearance, though, one of three concurrent online-only shows at James Fuentes Gallery, Mr. Sante focuses on one or two details at a time. Whether on reclaimed ledger paper or vintage picture postcards, the images he constructs are something like found details themselves -- singular and mysterious, if occasionally a little on the nose.

""America Falls"" adapts a souvenir photo of a waterfall into a picture of a man sneezing out enormous pathogens -- or possibly screaming something hateful. ""A Stranger in Town"" dates back to 2017, but its flaming red skeleton on a black charger now reads as epidemic as well as apocalypse, with an incidental reference, perhaps, to the recent resurgence of American socialism, while ""Empty Plinth Society 1,"" one of several to address the current toppling of monuments, shows an erased General Robert E. Lee still taking up space atop his white horse. My favorite is ""Napoleon,"" a simple superimposition of the French dictator's imperial portrait atop a writhing ouroboros of old-timey wrestlers. Brute animal struggle crowning itself with laurel leaves: That's pretty much where we are right now.

Wang Xu, an artist who was involved with an alternative art space and residency program called Practice run out of collective artists' studios, left New York in January to celebrate the Lunar New Year with his family in Dalian, China, assuming he would be gone a month. Seven months later, he is still in China, confined mostly to his family's apartment because of the coronavirus. ""Dream Animals,"" a special online presentation of his work on 47 Canal's website, offers a glimpse into his world. ""Seven Star Road"" (2020), a nearly 13-minute video made in his family's apartment, features close-ups of the artist's hands sawing, carving and sanding a piece of stone to create a small sculpture, as well as scenes of people working and moving about the drab cityscape below. The final image is the finished object: ""Daydreamer"" (2020), a soapstone sculpture of a curled-up animal. Other sculptures in the presentation feature real and mythical creatures carved or made with a 3-D printer and which recall figures in historical Chinese art and literature.

A series of Wang Xu's short poems on the website underscores our collective, odd and surreal year. One reads, ""In an empty station / Anxious people are looking for their return train / Afraid to miss them / At such a moment / We indeed live in a spectacle / Our body is our own monument."" This could apply to Wang Xu's sculptures and scenes in the video, but also to the current pandemic, in which fear and confinement are accompanied by opportunities for reflection and poetic reverie.",Galleries and museums are getting creative about presenting work online during the pandemic.

Fashion & Style,Anarchy in the Ateliers at Givenchy and Margiela,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/fashion/givenchy-margiela-armani-giambattista-valli-couture-fall-2019.html,"PARIS -- The night the United States beat Britain at the Women's World Cup to secure a place in the final, Clare Waight Keller, the Brit at the helm of Givenchy, let loose with a little anarchy in the palace. The events were not necessarily connected, but they had a kind of conceptual resonance. Sometimes you just want to smash some porcelain.

Or, in the case of the couture, some invisibly finished, tailored to the nth degree, every sequin in its place, perfection. When the world doesn't behave quite as you'd like and the goal posts move, you can either take refuge in beauty and the way things have been done, or create a little ruckus.

Ms. Waight Keller, for one, took the latter approach, imagining a winged creature trailing shreds of feathers and fringe, straps hanging off parachute puffs of pink taffeta and iridescent green jacquard, as she smashed her way through a host of classic chateaus (in reality it was the Musee des Arts Decoratifs, part of the Louvre complex, one of the most elaborate palaces in France). Fringed, shredded houndstooth and tweed were inspired by black and white tile flooring; glinting silver sequin tunic capes and jackets provided a jolt of silverware (silverwear); mint green and black feathered fantasias escaped from the aviary; and asymmetric ball gowns of beaded fringe and under-feathers, tulle and lace, teetered alluringly close to the edge of coming undone.

The collection was about as cool as couture gets in its elaborate insouciance and it had an energy that has been largely missing in a week where safe and stately has been the rule.",Clare Waight Keller and John Galliano make some mayhem; Giorgio Armani and Giambattista Valli play a different game.,87782e02-6a7b-505a-b03e-dbde467c3d12,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/04/fashion/04GIVENCHY-INYT-givenchy/04GIVENCHY-INYT-givenchy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a603c155f20c94e3847f9c06f4c12c9f9a837b9af3da9de73740287cb5f96bd4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Givenchy haute couture, fall 2019",87782e02-6a7b-505a-b03e-dbde467c3d12,N24News/imgs/87782e02-6a7b-505a-b03e-dbde467c3d12.jpg,19
Style,"How to Talk to People, According to Terry Gross",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/17/style/self-care/terry-gross-conversation-advice.html,"Terry Gross says that ""Tell me about yourself"" is the only ice-breaker you'll ever need.Credit...Daniel Dorsa for The New York Times

It's fair to say Terry Gross knows some things about talking to people. The host and co-executive producer of NPR's ""Fresh Air"" has interviewed thousands of personalities over the course of her four-decade career. It all started in the early 1970s, when, floundering a bit in her post-college life, she landed a gig at WBFO, a radio station in Buffalo. There she would call subjects and interview them for the program she hosted, ""This Is Radio."" She moved to Philadelphia in 1975 to host ""Fresh Air,"" the brainchild of a colleague from WBFO. Ms. Gross brings a combination of empathy and rigorous preparation to the job. ""I read, watch or listen to as much of the person's work as possible, so I have an understanding of what makes them, or their story, important,"" she said. ""I try to clarify in my own mind why this person matters, and why it's worthy of our listeners' time."" One thing she does not allow of her interview subjects, however, is input on the edit. ""When the interview is over, you don't have a chance to call back and say, 'Well I like my answer to this, I don't like my answer to that, can you edit that out,"" she said. (As someone who has been interviewed by Ms. Gross, I would like to say that I wish I hadn't insisted that her cats hate her. That said, I never asked for my comment to be removed from that particular episode of ""Fresh Air."")

In a subsequent chat, our roles reversed, Ms. Gross offered her thoughts on how to have a good conversation. 

""Tell me about yourself,"" 

a.k.a the only icebreaker 

you'll ever need Those are the only four words you need to navigate a potentially awkward conversation, whether on a blind date or at a cocktail party. Ms. Gross avoids asking more pointed questions (for example, ""What do you do for work?"") that presume information to be true. The beauty in opening with ""tell me about yourself"" is that it allows you to start a conversation without the fear that you're going to inadvertently make someone uncomfortable or self-conscious. Posing a broad question lets people lead you to who they are. As an interviewer, Ms. Gross's goal is to find out how her subject became who they are; as a conversationalist, make that goal your own.



Be funny (if you can). ""A good conversationalist is somebody who is fun to talk to,"" she said. Ms. Gross, it's worth noting, is very funny. If you can't be funny, being mentally organized, reasonably concise and energetic will go a long way in impressing people. Most of us will never find ourselves in the position of being interviewed by someone like Ms. Gross, but most of us will certainly find ourselves in the position of being interviewed by someone. Preparation, she says, is key. ""It helps to organize your thoughts beforehand by thinking about the things you expect you'll be asked and then reflecting on how you might answer,"" she said. A place where this can be especially helpful, particularly when meeting someone for the first time in a social setting, like a date, is considering how comfortable you are with opening up on certain topics. ""It's helpful to think through where your boundaries are, so that you're not paralyzed agonizing over whether you're willing to confide something or not."" In a job interview, organizing your thoughts by thinking about the things you expect you'll be asked and reflecting on how you might answer can help you navigate if things start to go badly. 

Take control 

by pivoting to something you want 

to talk about. Ms. Gross offered help for how to handle a job interview that's going badly. ""If somebody is asking you questions and you don't feel that you have a strong response for it, say, 'let me share an experience.'"" From there, you can share an experience that points to your talents and areas where you excel. An interview is a two-way street, which can be hard to remember when you're the applicant who desperately wants to land the gig, but Ms. Gross gently reminds us that as an interviewee, you're there to do some sussing out of your own. What is the job really like? What would be expected of you? Being prepared, too, can help you avoid getting caught off guard, or help you to more easily pivot the conversation to a subject that you've prepared yourself to talk about in a way that plays to your strengths.



Ms. Gross doesn't want you 

to dodge questions. 

But if you're going to, here's how. ""Well, I don't think it is in my self-interest to tutor people on how to dodge a question,"" Ms. Gross said. But, when pressed -- perhaps regretting the previous advice she gave to this interviewer about how to get people to answer questions they don't want to answer (""keep asking"") -- she suggests using honesty. Say, ""I don't want to answer that,"" or, if that's too blunt, hedge with a statement like, ""I'm having a difficult time thinking of a specific answer to that."" Going the martyr route with something like, ""I'm afraid by answering that I'm going to hurt somebody's feelings and I don't want to do that,"" is another option. Ms. Gross wishes that everyone would pay attention to other people's body language. ""Try to pick up on when you've kind of lost somebody's attention,"" she said. That way, you can avoid boring your fellow interlocutor to death or holding someone up from getting to wherever they may actually need to be. If the person engaging you in ceaseless chatter won't take the hint, Ms. Gross again recommends honesty. ""Well, there's the truth, which is I'd love to talk some more, but I'm really late,"" even, she says, if it feels rude to cut things off. ""If a person is being insensitive to you, you don't have a commitment to be beholden to their insensitivity."" 

When to push back, 

and when not to Ms. Gross prefers to interview artists and creators over politicians, and she approaches those baskets of interviewees differently. Politicians, she believes, ""owe us an answer,"" and so she, in her own very Terry Gross way will ""keep asking and re-asking and asking, and maybe I'll ask it in separate ways, and maybe I'll point out that they haven't yet answered the question."" She prefers, however, to interview people who work in arts and culture, and offers those subjects more leeway to set parameters for the conversation. ""I tell people that if I ask them anything too personal they should let me know and I'll move on,"" she said. ""I want the liberty to ask anything with the understanding that if I'm pushing too far, my guest has the liberty -- and they know they have the liberty -- to tell me that I'm going too far. And once you told somebody that, you've committed to it, and you better fulfill the commitment.""",The NPR host offers eight spicy tips for having better conversations.,b0140975-8db7-5a72-8ede-8158b40574eb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/19/fashion/19terry-SUB/18TERRY3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=1cbe4bf481dbfca386f9f157537c4a9c50303a0b877877b91acd7d1b8ff7f50d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ms. Gross in the WHYY studios in Philadelphia.

Your Money,"A Fund to Support the Muslim American Community, Inside and Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/24/your-money/pillars-fund-muslim-americans-suppport.html,"After attaining professional success and wealth, Anas Osman, a technology entrepreneur and executive, turned to philanthropy. He wanted to help other Muslim Americans embrace the opportunities in the United States. So he and some friends from Chicago, who had also achieved financial success, came up with an idea that was decidedly unconventional. They didn't want to build an app for charity or introduce a new metric for giving. Instead, Mr. Osman and his friends, all Muslim Americans, created a model that more closely resembled a 19th-century benevolent society. Their organization, the Pillars Fund, would hark back to what similar groups did for Irish, Italian and Chinese immigrants: support organizations working in an ethnic community while trying to counter negative perceptions. The organization started in 2010 as a donor-advised fund, an investment vehicle created to manage donations on behalf of charities. It was set up at the Chicago Community Trust, a community foundation in their hometown, Mr. Osman said. In the first year, it received a matching grant from a group founded by George Russell, whose company created the Russell stock indexes.

""That helped seal our fate together,"" he said. ""There was a greater sense of responsibility and duty. We got into the flow."" In using an earlier model of philanthropic engagement, the founders of the Pillars Fund aimed to support service organizations in the Muslim American community. But they also wanted to help groups working to change the narrative of Muslims and present a more diverse view of the community than extremists and Hollywood generally portray. Doing this in an age of social media, with its easy engagement and rapid dissemination of news, presents an opportunity that benevolent societies of the past did not have: promoting positive portrayals while also responding to negative ones in real time. Succeeding in that mission, even with the aid of technology, is not easy. Leslie Lenkowsky, professor emeritus at the Indiana University Lilly Family School of Philanthropy, said an organization like Pillars could thrive simply by acting as a vetting organization. Philanthropy needs that type of scrutiny, he said, citing an example in which, after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Muslims gave money to a faith-based charity that was actually funneling the donations to Islamic terrorist groups.

Mr. Osman said he was raised to give back. His parents had come to the United States from Syria to work as doctors. They invested their time in community building, helping to put up a mosque in the Chicago suburb where they lived. His first endeavor in philanthropy was starting a group to help Muslim American students and young professionals contend with their identities after the Sept. 11 attacks. The strategy of Pillars is different. It looks to community organizations that are too small to attract support from large foundations like the Open Society or the Ford Foundation (which has provided funding to Pillars). In this way, Pillars acts like a venture capital incubator for social ideas. ""We wanted to give unrestricted support for three years and hope the organizations matured,"" Mr. Osman said. ""And if they matured sufficiently, Pillars would be in their rearview mirror."" The challenge was expanding their fund-raising beyond the five founders. Kashif M. Shaikh, who was working at the Robert R. McCormick Foundation, a large foundation in Chicago, initially volunteered to help the founders run their fund. As it grew, he became Pillars' executive director, charged with bringing in more funders while honing the organization's mission. Last year, the fund made 26 grants totaling about $625,000. That's small for any nonprofit organization. The organization, though, is trying to pick its spots: fighting poverty, combating racism in the Muslim community and promoting entertainment with positive role models, like ""Ramy,"" a series on Hulu about the life of an Egyptian-American living in New Jersey.

Sameer Shamsi, who works as an investment banker in New York, joined Pillars as a trustee. Young and successful, he had been giving in a traditional way: sending money to his college and business school, because, he said, they had asked him. Having grown up going to Catholic school by day and Muslim school at night, he toggled between the two worlds and learned how to exist successfully in both. He said he had been drawn to Pillars by the opportunity to do the same on a larger scale. ""Many of the initiatives Pillars supported then and continues to support today were early in their life cycle,"" said Mr. Shamsi. ""I felt we were seeding really exciting investments."" One initiative Pillars supports is an oral history project at the Brooklyn Historical Society. It aims to show the scope of the Muslim community in Brooklyn and its contribution to the borough and the country. Another is an anti-racism group focused within the Muslim community. Margari Hill, a co-founder and executive director of the Muslim Anti-Racism Collaborative, said that Muslims in the United States were roughly divided into thirds -- black, South Asian and Middle Eastern -- and that they did not necessarily get along despite their shared faith. ""We want to change the conversation,"" said Kalia Abiade, director of programs at Pillars. ""We think American Muslims can contribute to society in a way that advances opportunity for all people.""

The funders behind Pillars looked to other faith-based organizations, particularly in the Jewish community, for guidance, but they also wanted to leverage the dollars in a more substantial way. Dilara Sayeed, who founded vPeer, a mentorship group, and her husband, Yousuf, a doctor, redirected their own donations to Pillars to increase the effect they could have. ""I didn't want to be figuring it out ourselves,"" said Ms. Sayeed, who is now a trustee. ""How did other groups do this? How could we use models from L.G.B.T.Q. and Jewish groups and not have to reinvent this all ourselves?"" Outside organizations have taken note. The Ford Foundation has given $1.65 million to Pillars since 2016, to support grants around creating community engagement and preventing bias and discrimination. The Nathan Cummings Foundation, whose money is derived from the wealth of the founder of Sara Lee baked goods, has given both money -- $300,000 -- and support as a Jewish faith-based charity. Measuring success isn't as clear. Mr. Shamsi, the banker, said one measure was the level of interest. There were 200 inquiries in 2018 for the 26 grants that were awarded, about the same as the year before. But on the bigger issue of the perceptions of Muslim Americans, change was not going to be quick. ""We have to be patient with the long game,"" Ms. Sayeed said. ""It's not frustrating, but it's required us to keep our focus."" Professor Lenkowsky of Indiana University said that changing the perception of any ethnic group took decades and that even then, it was never fully transformed.

""The old stereotypes to some degree fade away, but they never really do,"" he said. ""They never really fade, but people make their way and they get past some of this."" But for Mr. Osman and his co-founders, being a voice in that debate is crucial. His goal is to give to more groups to increase their visibility and through that ""to ultimately humanize American Muslims and underscore the breadth of what American Muslim means -- as opposed to a very narrow definition.""",The founders of the Pillars Fund seek to strengthen a network of Muslim support groups while countering negative perceptions and stereotypes.,0520e556-b557-56fe-bfc8-e06768ea47ac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/24/business/24WEALTH-01/24WEALTH-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=db89f1f8d196bdbbd3bd6b9ac3a4e9722f85ef75919253ea7eb73067c35a6c00&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Anas Osman, a founding trustee of the Pillars Fund.",0520e556-b557-56fe-bfc8-e06768ea47ac,N24News/imgs/0520e556-b557-56fe-bfc8-e06768ea47ac.jpg,21
Your Money,"New Cars Are Too Expensive for the Typical Family, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/02/your-money/new-cars-are-too-expensive-for-the-typical-family-study-finds.html,"Bankrate noted that a traditional rule of thumb is the ""20/4/10"" rule: Car buyers should aim to put down at least 20 percent in cash, take out a loan for no more than four years and keep the cost of principal, interest and insurance to no more than 10 percent of household income.

If you have to abandon those guidelines, the car you want may simply be too expensive. ""To me, if you need to finance to five, six or seven years, you can't afford it,"" said Jeff Bartlett, deputy cars editor at Consumer Reports.

Ron Montoya, senior consumer advice editor with Edmunds.com, noted that interest rates were still low for new-car loans, but advised shoppers to keep the loan term at no more than five years. (Edmunds has an online calculator that you can use to estimate how much you can afford to pay. He also recommends checking the cost of insuring a specific model before buying it, so you won't be shocked when you get your insurance bill after you've made the purchase.

Here are some questions and answers about buying a new car:

When is the best time to shop for a new car?

While car sales may abound on holiday weekends like the Fourth of July, shopping on a run-of-the-mill weekday may actually be preferable. There is less traffic to deal with when taking test drives, and sales representatives have more time to answer your questions. ""Buy when it's right for you,"" Mr. Bartlett said, not just because dealers are promoting incentives.

Mr. Pounds suggests shopping when car manufacturers are beginning to introduce new model years -- typically in late summer or early fall. Prices may be more reasonable for the outgoing model year at that time. But be aware that you may have fewer vehicles to choose from.

How can I make sure I'm choosing the right financing option?

People are often diligent about researching the type of car they want to buy, but they're much less likely to do their homework when it comes to financing the purchase, according to a report this month from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

To help consumers comparison-shop, the bureau has created an auto loan ""shopping sheet"" that can help you calculate the total cost of a car loan and compare offers.

Should I buy a used car instead?

Used cars, particularly those that are just two or three years old, often offer the best value, Mr. Bartlett said. Not only is the initial price lower, but costs like collision insurance and taxes are also lower. If getting the latest safety features, like automatic braking, is a priority, however, make sure to look only at very recent model years. And be sure, he said, to have a used car inspected by a reputable mechanic before you buy it.",An analysis from Bankrate.com found that median-income households in the 50 largest cities could not afford the average price of a new car.,38d1df43-aec2-56aa-9c15-1b0a1f298c11,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/02/automobiles/02cars_hp/02cars_hp-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=7163f41caa0dfce8a59ba84a28e82da3960ffe1d1799c97e73f3d924b3d08c25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Acura ILX 2.0.,38d1df43-aec2-56aa-9c15-1b0a1f298c11,N24News/imgs/38d1df43-aec2-56aa-9c15-1b0a1f298c11.jpg,21
Music,The Weeknd's 'After Hours' Earns the Year's Biggest Debut Week,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/arts/music/the-weeknd-after-hours-billboard.html,"The Weeknd's new album, ""After Hours,"" debuted at the top of the latest Billboard album chart, with the equivalent of 444,000 sales in the United States, according to Nielsen -- the biggest opening of the year so far.

""After Hours"" had 221 million streams and sold 275,000 copies as a full album. The sales were helped by a variety of bundles that included copies of the album with merchandise and tickets to the Weeknd's tour, set to begin in June. But as with every other tour this year, the Weeknd's plans on the road depend on how quickly the spread of the coronavirus is slowed, and much of the concert industry is bracing for summer shows to be postponed.

Dance,"Marian Horosko, Dancer and Advocate for the Art, Dies at 92",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/22/arts/dance/marian-horosko-dancer-and-advocate-for-the-art-dead-at-92.html,"Marian Horosko, a ballet dancer who became both an advocate for the art form and a historian of it, writing books on Martha Graham and May O'Donnell as well as practical guides, died on Sept. 11 in the Bronx. She was 92. The death, at a nursing facility, was announced on the website of Dance Magazine, where Ms. Horosko was an editor and writer for many years. Ms. Horosko danced with the Metropolitan Ballet from 1951 to 1954 and then for eight years with New York City Ballet. But she had begun her future career, writing, even while still performing, sending dispatches to various publications, including from the road. ""She was the only dancer who carried an old-fashioned typewriter with her on tour,"" Dr. Judith F. Kupersmith, a fellow dancer at City Ballet, recalled in an interview. She was later Ms. Horosko's co-author on two manuals for dancers.

Her writing could be practical, as it was in those manuals, or lyrical, as in her book ""Martha Graham: The Evolution of Her Dance Theory and Training,"" a collection of interviews published in 1991 and revised in 2002. In the introduction, she noted that as a child Graham was influenced by stories told to her by her nurse and her family's Japanese gardeners. ""Graham knew about witches, wee folk and the poetic mystery of things,"" Ms. Horosko wrote. ""Some called Martha a sorceress, in the Irish sense of having insight, intuition and the ability to command people to do her bidding. Others said she was a witch. She was witty and scholarly, had an extremely flexible body, was mentally disciplined, and was small but powerful, approachable to the earnest but distant to the novice, quiet yet eloquent, simple yet complex."" Marian Anna Horosko was born in Cleveland on Aug. 4, 1925, to Louis Horosko, an upholsterer, and the former Marian Gromand. She was a dancer from a young age, making her debut at 12 with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. She studied at the Juilliard School and the School of American Ballet. Before joining the Metropolitan Opera's ballet corps, Ms. Horosko appeared on Broadway in the ensemble of ""Oklahoma!"" and in two musical revues. She also appeared as a dancer in two 1951 movies: ""Royal Wedding,"" which starred Fred Astaire and Jane Powell, and ""An American in Paris,"" with Gene Kelly and Leslie Caron.

""Marian Horosko plays a quarrelsome flirt like a genuine comedian,"" John Martin wrote in The New York Times in January 1957, reviewing a performance of Todd Bolender's ""Souvenirs"" at City Center. After her performing career ended in the early 1960s, she stayed connected to the dancing world through her writing, much of it for Dance Magazine. She was education editor there for many years, offering advice for dancers on how to care for their hair and their toe shoes as well as writing longer articles, including a series on ""Teachers in the Russian Tradition."" Ms. Horosko was also film curator of the Lincoln Center Dance Collection and produced and consulted on dance programs for television and radio. In the late 1960s she traveled to Cuba, where she produced a documentary with National Educational Television on the ballerina Alicia Alonso. Ms. Horosko knew from personal experience the challenges dancers face both during their performing careers and after, and she made efforts to address them. In the 1980s she was an organizer of a group called Danse Coalition, formed in response to the problem of disappearing studio space in Manhattan; many studios were shuttering because of high rents.

Also in the 1980s, she was among the founders of the Performing Arts Center for Health in New York, a clinic devoted to the physical and mental health needs of dancers and former dancers. ""We want to be able to help dancers to get help, and get it right away, from doctors who won't just tell them to 'stay off their feet,' "" she said in a 1982 interview with The Times. Another driving force in that nonprofit venture was Dr. Kupersmith, whom Ms. Horosko had known when they were both City Ballet dancers, and who became a psychiatrist after her performing career. Dr. Kupersmith said that after she and Ms. Horosko reconnected, they would often talk about dancers' needs and the obstacles facing them. ""She would always bring a tape recorder wherever she went, and she would tape our conversations,"" Dr. Kupersmith recalled. In 1987 those tapes formed the basis of a book by the two of them, ""The Dancer's Survival Manual: Everything You Need to Know About Being a Dancer ... Except How to Dance."" A second edition was published in 2009 with a new subtitle, ""Everything You Need to Know From the First Class to Career Change."" ""Marian Horosko was compellingly sensible and humane in her writing on dance, glamorous yet pragmatic, with an encyclopedic passion for the art,"" Jennifer Dunning, a former dance critic for The Times, wrote in an email. ""To spend even a brief time in her company was to be charmed and fascinated by the way her mind worked and the way, after a ballet debut at 12, she never stopped exploring dance.""","After a performing career that included eight years with New York City Ballet, Ms. Horosko wrote books and championed the health and other needs of dancers.",f61262cd-8622-5b90-b036-89e0a5f4ffdf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/23/obituaries/23horosko1/22horosko1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=5f4df5dcb3c866695e8b86af8b76c618767fb174733d70805858aa1844a94532&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Marian Horosko in an undated photograph.

Television,Here's What to Watch on TV This Summer,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/23/arts/television/summer-tv-shows-2019.html,"More more more. However you like it, television has it this summer: ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" reinterpreted by Mindy Kaling, Meryl Streep joining the beach party on ""Big Little Lies,"" new adventures from ""Stranger Things,"" continuing horrors on ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and -- for those with specialized tastes -- a barely recognizable Russell Crowe playing Roger Ailes in ""The Loudest Voice."" From more than 50 new and old shows premiering over the next three months, here are 22 to check out , in my own order of anticipation -- beginning with a new chapter of a modern classic that made our list of the best dramas since ""The Sopranos."" All dates subject to change. Good TV shows follow Kristen Bell around: Between seasons of ""The Good Place,"" she fit in this eight-episode revival of the beloved beach-town mystery series last seen on CW in 2007. (A feature film, also starring Bell, came out in 2014.) An adult Veronica, still paired up with Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring) and now the principal of Mars Investigations, goes after a serial killer, joined by much of the original cast, including her dad Keith (Enrico Colantoni), and her buddy Wallace (Percy Daggs III). (July 26, Hulu) With ""Game of Thrones"" gone and ""The Walking Dead"" stumbling, the Duffer Brothers' nostalgic amalgam of science-fiction and horror is the buzziest show left standing. In Season 3, set in 1985, the Indiana town that's the unwitting gateway to a threatening alternate dimension gets a new mall -- perhaps a strategic adjustment to the reality that the show's young stars are now in their midteens. (July 4, Netflix)

The most singular new show of the summer is probably this otherworldly, deadpan comedy about a group of friends and horror aficionados who figure out how to monetize their fandom. Made under the aegis of Lorne Michaels and Fred Armisen, who has a recurring role, it's a Spanish-language production filmed in Chile. Ana Fabrega (the woods-dwelling temptress Esther on ""At Home With Amy Sedaris"") and the ""Saturday Night Live"" writer Julio Torres star and do the bulk of the writing. (June 14, HBO) This mini-series based on the much beloved 1994 film does not have Hugh Grant, or Duckface, or Mr. Bean, or the writing of Richard Curtis. But it was created by Mindy Kaling and her ""Mindy Project"" collaborator Matt Warburton, so there's reason to watch. And it does have Andie MacDowell. (July 31, Hulu)

Emma Thompson hasn't been on TV a whole lot since the 1980s, so it's exciting to see her in this ambitious, ""Black Mirror""-ish mini-series written by Russell T. Davies (""Queer as Folk,"" ""Doctor Who""), which sets the domestic drama of a British extended family against increasingly dire world events. Thompson plays a polarizing member of Parliament, and the impressive cast also includes Rory Kinnear, Russell Tovey and Jessica Hynes. (June 24, HBO) The five actors playing the wrongly convicted teenagers in Ava DuVernay's four-part dramatization of the Central Park jogger case aren't well known, but they're surrounded by a strong ensemble that includes Aunjanue Ellis, Michael K. Williams, John Leguizamo, Vera Farmiga, Kylie Bunbury, Niecy Nash and Joshua Jackson. The casting also provides an unexpected talking point now that Felicity Huffman, who plays the central role of the prosecutor Linda Fairstein, has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit mail fraud in the college-admissions scandal. (May 31, Netflix) Back in 1994, the charm of ""Armistead Maupin's Tales of the City"" on PBS was inextricably bound up with an instant nostalgia for the San Francisco of the 1970s and '80s. That city is long gone, but Laura Linney and Olympia Dukakis are back as Mary Ann Singleton and Anna Madrigal -- celebrating her 90th birthday -- in the fourth mini-series based on Maupin's breezy, wistful novels. (June 7, Netflix)

Mainstream TV's trippiest show (or its nerdiest? Is there a difference?) leans even more heavily into psychedelic puzzlement in the early stages of its third and final season. Lauren Tsai joins the cast, making her dramatic acting debut after playing herself in ""Terrace House: Aloha State."" (June 24, FX) Carla Gugino nearly always deserves better than the material she gets (or chooses). That may turn out to be true of this series created by her life partner, Sebastian Gutierrez, with whom she's made six movies in the last 12 years. But the chance to see her in the lead of a noirish crime drama -- the first one she's done on TV since the underrated ""Karen Sisco"" in 2004 -- is intriguing nonetheless. She plays a master thief just out of jail and focused on her young daughter, and Giancarlo Esposito is the crime boss trying to pull her back in. (June 14, Cinemax)

If there were a pound-for-pound ranking for streaming services, DC Universe would be a contender -- its first three original series are all above-average examples of their genre (the comic-book adaptation) and this, the fourth, looks like another. How closely will it hew to the plot points and poetics of Alan Moore's hugely influential run as a writer of the comic book? (Including, crucially, where Swamp Thing falls on the human-to-vegetable spectrum?) It's an unfair question that will determine, to an even greater extent than usual, how comics fans respond to the series. (May 31, DC Universe)

The second season of AMC's horror anthology tells an Asian-American story with a predominantly Asian cast. Unlike another high-profile series with similar bona fides, Cinemax's ""Warrior,"" ""Infamy"" also has an Asian-American showrunner (Alexander Woo, a writer and producer for ""True Blood"" and ""Manhattan"") and, for extra authenticity, George Takei as a performer and historical consultant. Like ""Warrior,"" it's a period piece set in an Asian enclave, a Japanese fishing village in Southern California in the ominous year of 1941. Apparently a tong war (or, in this case, some meddling dark spirits from the old country) still gives an Asian story a better chance of getting onscreen. (Aug. 12, AMC) It's an inescapable truth that each new season of ""Handmaid's Tale,"" in which a religious dictatorship oppresses and sexually enslaves women in a near-future America, gains extra resonance from what's happening in the country around it. The passage of anti-abortion laws in Alabama and Georgia has increased the buzz around Season 3, in which Elisabeth Moss's June resumes her servitude after giving up on an escape attempt. (June 5, Hulu)

Bashir Salahuddin and Diallo Riddle, writers for ""Late Night With Jimmy Fallon"" and ""The Last O.G.,"" and Sultan Salahuddin created and star in this amiable comedy about a pair of big-dreaming community college graduates in Chicago's Englewood neighborhood. (July 24, Comedy Central) Jim Gavin's sunny Southern California fable about the members of a faded, highly fanciful fraternal order gets a second season. Give thanks for TV's ravenous appetite for content, and AMC's good taste. (Aug. 12, AMC) A short fifth season consisting of three longish episodes (61, 67 and 70 minutes). ""Striking Vipers,"" starring Anthony Mackie and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II as friends brought together by a video game, is the one people will be talking about. ""Rachel, Jack and Ashley Too,"" a twist on a devil-doll horror story with Miley Cyrus, is the one that's really fun. (June 5, Netflix)","From 'Veronica Mars' to 'Stranger Things,' 22 new and returning TV shows to put on your calendar.",127d21a5-22d4-5c1b-9b47-20de278bf9cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/24/arts/23summertv-veronica/23summertv-veronica-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5557e41bdbb415216fd4aef26ed3daabdca2176a549a74cc35eb148c9c1a7b64&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kristen Bell in a new revival of &ldquo;Veronica Mars,&rdquo; debuting July on Hulu.",127d21a5-22d4-5c1b-9b47-20de278bf9cc,N24News/imgs/127d21a5-22d4-5c1b-9b47-20de278bf9cc.jpg,3
Science,Lanternflies Eat Everything in Sight. The U.S. Is Looking Delicious.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/science/lanternflies-pennsylvania-crops.html,"Lanternflies Eat Everything in Sight. The U.S. Is Looking Delicious.

To most people, the buds and sprouts of April are welcome heralds of spring. But to some farmers and scientists in the southeastern corner of Pennsylvania, these signs mark the beginning of a long season of dread. Their worry is Lycorma delicatula, the spotted lanternfly. It is an invasive pest with a voracious appetite and remarkable reproductive talents. Native to Asia, lanternflies first appeared in Pennsylvania in 2014. Despite a quarantine effort, they have also been discovered in small numbers in New York, Delaware and Virginia. In their native range, lanternflies feed primarily on one type of tree -- Ailanthus, the tree of heaven. The trees are an invasive species, too, common across the continental United States, and so entomologists fear lanternflies one day may spread to far-flung corners of the country.

A nationwide outbreak would be something of a disaster, some scientists believe. Among the lanternfly's more alarming qualities is an ability to feed on a huge range of plants, including many of commercial value. Lanternflies are believed to use at least forty species of native plants in the United States as hosts. They are particularly fond of grapevines, apple and stone fruit trees as well as a number of hardwood trees, like black walnut and maple. ""We've seen it in hops, we've seen it in some of the grain crops that are out there, soybean and what have you,"" said Fred R. Strathmeyer Jr., Pennsylvania's deputy secretary of agriculture. ""It's able to feed on many, many different things."" While it is too soon to gauge how much damage lanternflies might cause in the long-term, they can easily decimate certain crops in a single season. ""They've been appearing in grapes, and we have reports from growers last year of a 90 percent loss,"" said Julie Urban, a senior research associate at Penn State.

Then there is the lanternfly's unusual ability to lay eggs on almost any surface. While other species tend to deposit eggs on a living plant or in soil nearby, lanternflies can place a bundle of eggs nearly anywhere -- wheel wells, train cars, shipping containers. Agricultural inspectors in Pennsylvania have even started checking beehives for lanternfly eggs. ""Most pests deposit their eggs on their host plant, or very close, so they already have food available,"" said Surendra Dara, an adviser at the University of California Cooperative Extension. ""Those that have the advantage of being able to lay eggs on non-plant material obviously have a better chance of surviving and spreading,"" he added. To try to contain lanternflies, regulators have set up a quarantine zone in Pennsylvania that now spans over 3,000 square miles (up from 174 in 2016) and includes 13 counties, as well as Philadelphia. The state prohibits the moving of certain items within the zone, including firewood, outdoor furniture and construction debris. Officials also have launched a permit program for companies shipping goods out of the area. ""It's not just an agriculture problem, this is truly an across-the-board commerce problem, because we are trying not to move it,"" said Mr. Strathmeyer. ""This is everyday people, this is the trucking company, the U.P.S. driver, the delivery guy."" In February, the federal Agriculture Department stepped in as well, setting aside $17.5 million in emergency funding to finance research and help the quarantine effort.

Many scientists who have studied lanternflies fear that the pace at which populations have grown so far suggests an uphill battle ahead. ""It's unbelievably eruptive in terms of its population,"" said Michael Saunders, a professor emeritus of entomology at Penn State. ""The very first year we went out, in 2015, you had to really hunt for egg masses, and then over the next two years it was just spectacularly exponential in its growth."" ""I've been through a few waves of invasive species, and this is far and away the most incredible thing I've ever seen,"" he said. South Korea is the only other country in which the spotted lanternfly is an introduced pest. It was first observed in 2004, and its impact on agriculture there has become a cautionary tale. ""It spread across the whole country in three years,"" said Dr. Urban. ""It's still a problem there."" Like aphids, lanternflies feed on plant sap and excrete most of the carbohydrates they consume in the form of honeydew -- a sticky, syrupy liquid. The honeydew promotes the growth of mold, which can ruin produce and cover leaves, blocking out sunlight and killing plants. In residential areas, honeydew can coat yards and porches, and its sugary consistency attracts gnats, bees and other unwanted insects. ""I've actually seen stalagmites of hardened honeydew on the ground,"" said Dr. Saunders. ""If you're an entomologist, it's spectacular, but if you're a homeowner and you have these in your yard, it's a nightmare.""

Lanternflies have mostly been contained in Pennsylvania so far, so some experts hope that they may still be eradicated through traditional means. A variety of insecticides are being tested. In March, lawmakers in Maryland even tabled a bill to ban chlorpyrifos, a pesticide deemed unsafe by the Environmental Protection Agency some years ago, in anticipation of needing it to combat lanternflies in coming months. Researchers have also begun studying the insect's natural predators in Asia, with an eye to possibly releasing them in the United States. Several species of parasitic wasps are under consideration as a method of biological control, though this strategy typically only becomes practical once an invasive species becomes established. ""Biocontrol is an option that you would take up after eradication has been ruled out,"" said Kim Hoelmer, a research entomologist at the Agriculture Department. Scientists are pondering more experimental solutions as well. A team of researchers at the University of Kentucky is exploring using RNA interference, or RNAi, to develop a novel insecticide. The technology works by silencing the expression of genes that are critical for vital functions like movement, but are also unique to a given species of insect. Last year, the E.P.A. approved the first RNAi-based insecticides for use against another pest, corn rootworm. ""RNAi is one of the ways to control insects in a target-specific manner with precision, without harming the environment,"" said Subba Reddy Palli, a professor of entomology at the University of Kentucky.

While RNAi has proved ineffective against other types of insects, notably many species of butterflies and moths, early indications are that the spotted lanternfly may be susceptible. With more sophisticated solutions still years away, however, many of those working to halt the advance of lanternflies in the field are staying focused on the present. If trends continue, this season is expected to be an important predictor of how severe the problem could become. ""2018 is going to be a critical year for us to know whether we'll be able to really effectively contain, suppress and ultimately eradicate this pest or not,"" said Osama El-Lissy, a deputy administrator of plant protection and quarantine at the Agriculture Department.","The invasive insects turned up in Pennsylvania in 2014.

Food,"A Deeper, Darker Look at James Beard, Food Oracle and Gay Man",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/15/dining/james-beard-book-john-birdsall.html,"Fifty years ago, this is how the foremost American food authority described his favorite menu for a holiday open house: ""I put out a big board of various slicing sausages -- salami, Polish sausage, whatever I find in the market that looks good -- and an assortment of mustards. I also like to have another board of cheeses: Swiss Gruyere, a fine Cheddar and maybe a Brie. And with the cheeses, I serve thinly sliced rye bread and crackers of some kind and a bowl of fruit."" In other words: James Beard, who died in 1985 at age 81, was a master of the charcuterie board long before it became a staple on Instagram and Pinterest -- and even before those platforms' founders were born. Discovering seeds of the present in the past happens again and again when revisiting Beard's body of work, which I did this fall in anticipation of the first new biography of him in 30 years: ""The Man Who Ate Too Much,"" by John Birdsall, published in October by W.W. Norton. For the first time, Mr. Birdsall brings both scholarly research and a queer lens to Beard's life, braiding the strands of privilege and pain, performance and anxiety, into an entirely new story.

It is still astonishingly fresh in many ways. ""Along with the growth of organic gardening and the health foods cult, there is a renewed interest in food from the wilds,"" begins the book's chapter on vegetables. Unlike ""Joy of Cooking"" and the ""Betty Crocker Cookbook,"" other kitchen bibles of the time, ""American Cookery"" rarely calls for frozen vegetables, canned fruit, cake mix or similar convenience foods. Many of Beard's recipe lists read like a modern Brooklyn bistro menu, with items like sunchokes and sliders, scallion tart and roasted figs with prosciutto. Many others reflect the relatively broad view that he took of American cooking: ceviche, Syrian lentil soup with Swiss chard, menudo and basil pesto -- a radically raw and shockingly flavorful sauce at the time.

The food of the United States wasn't then considered a true cuisine, like that of France, China, Japan or Italy, where culinary traditions were built over centuries. But the American melting pot had been combining ingredients through generations of immigration. And in the counterculture of the 1970s, the idea of the global palate was filtering into the mainstream, sweeping Chinese cooking classes, Indian spice blends, Japanese pottery and Moroccan tagines into U.S. kitchens. Often, those ideas arrived through white male gatekeepers like Beard, the New York Times food editor Craig Claiborne and the members of the Wine and Food Society of New York, a group then dominated by wealthy gay men. All chefs who now describe their food as ""new American"" owe something to Beard, though most know him only as the face stamped on the culinary medals bestowed annually by the foundation named for him. Following his death, the organization was started as a way to preserve his legacy and his Greenwich Village townhouse. After a halting start and a 2004 embezzlement scandal that resulted in a prison term for the group's president, the foundation has grown along with the power of its awards, as restaurants and chefs have become ever more important elements of popular culture. But most chefs, and others who have known Beard through his countless books, columns and television appearances (which began in 1946), have had no idea of what Mr. Birdsall calls the ""messy"" parts of his story.

And there are troubling, messy parts: plagiarizing and taking credit for other people's recipes, accepting paid endorsements for products that he did not always believe in, and exposing himself to and fondling young men who hoped for his professional support. ""Delights and Prejudices,"" Beard's 1964 ""memoir with recipes,"" paints a nostalgic picture of a nearly preindustrial childhood among the wealthy class of Portland, Ore. In Beard's telling, it was happy, glamorous and shot through with glowing food moments: wild salmon and huckleberries at the family's house at Gearhart Beach; fresh abalone, white asparagus and crab legs in San Francisco dining rooms; foie gras and Dungeness crab aboard the luxury vessels that ran between Portland and Los Angeles. But Mr. Birdsall's research, including extensive interviews with Beard's contemporaries, revealed shadows that Beard never mentioned. Born in 1903, Beard was an only child raised mostly by his mother, Elizabeth Beard, who was famous for her cooking at the elegant boardinghouse she ran, the Gladstone, in the days of oyster patties, roast pheasant and charlotte russe. The person who did most of the actual kitchen work was Jue Let, a masterly cook from Guangdong who worked at the Gladstone and then in the Beard family home for more than a decade. He fed James congee, steamed salt fish and lychees -- and satisfied the boy's exacting mother by flawlessly executing her formulas for chicken stock, pie crusts and dry-aged meat. She and Mr. Let instilled in Beard the culinary ethos of fresh and seasonal ingredients, carefully cooked, that became Beard's contribution to the American food revolution of the 1970s.

But in Mr. Birdsall's empathetic telling, it also meant that Beard's mother never concealed her impatience with him, his childhood needs and his growing differences. In most of Beard's writing, ""he's still pushing the story of grand, happy boyhood holidays,"" Mr. Birdsall said. But at the glorious duck dinners and mince pie feasts that Beard describes, he was usually the sole child present; his father, who avoided his mother's racy friends, was often absent, and Beard learned to perform for the crowd, as he felt compelled to for the rest of his life. ""I soon became as precocious and nasty a child as ever inhabited Portland,"" he wrote in his memoir. There seems to have never been a time when Beard was comfortable in his own skin. According to Mr. Birdsall, who gained access to many of Beard's unpublished writings, he knew he was gay from a very young age. The first public airing of his gay identity was traumatic: In his freshman year at Reed College, he was caught by his roommates in a sexual encounter with a professor, and summarily expelled -- a double humiliation that he never entirely recovered from. Being expelled from Reed meant effectively being banished from home -- albeit with a wide socio-economic safety net. He sailed for Europe, discovered the gay underground in London and Paris, moved to New York and began his food career in the 1930s, catering parties thrown by Manhattan's gay and art-world elites.

Mr. Zimmern said he loved the chaotic generosity: whole salmon poaching in a copper pot on the industrial stove, giant platters of charcuterie and cheese, piles of ingredients and bowls of fruit everywhere, and Beard presiding over all of it -- tasting, carving, slicing, roaring and going through multiple changes of silk pajamas. He also remembers encountering tastes there for the first time, like a braise of chicken with olives, almonds and raisins, a dish with roots in Spain and California that Beard made often. But mainly, he said, he remembers the feeling of being free. ""There were so many places that my dads were uncomfortable, on their guard, even though we went to restaurants all the time,"" Mr. Zimmern said.",A new biography traces the influence he wielded as a writer and the pain he endured for his sexuality in an unwelcoming world.,e03a302c-90e2-56a6-b3d4-e2bb098cdc07,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/16/dining/15Beardbook1/merlin_181069884_6185d6c1-7d8e-4bd4-b747-f70c6a0a2c54-facebookJumbo.jpg,"James Beard in his Greenwich Village kitchen in 1964, the year his memoir, ""Delights and Prejudices,"" was published.

Movies,Independent Spirit Awards: 4 Winners Make the Most of Their Moment,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/24/movies/independent-spirit-awards.html,"The Independent Spirit Awards are often positioned as the casual alternative to the Oscars even if the ceremony, held in a Santa Monica tent the afternoon before the Academy Awards, often features some of the same nominees and winners. Still, at this year's event, some major changes were evident. For one, unlike the Oscars, the Indie Spirits actually had a host in the witty Aubrey Plaza. The most notable difference, though, was how people made the most of their acceptance speeches. More than once, as someone spoke at the microphone on Saturday, I thought, ""I bet you won't see that tomorrow."" [Read the Carpetbagger's Oscar predictions, then fill out your ballot.] Part of that freshness was due to the fact that several of the Independent Spirit winners hadn't been victorious at other award shows this season, and this offered them the first notable chance to seize the spotlight. Take Richard E. Grant, the supporting actor winner for ""Can You Ever Forgive Me?"" who has lost most prizes to the ""Green Book"" star Mahershala Ali but has won Hollywood hearts with his happiness to just be nominated.

When he took the stage to accept his Independent Spirit Award, Grant had to fight back tears. His character in the 1991-set film eventually succumbs to AIDS and Grant told the audience, ""This movie, more than anything, is an homage to that generation of men who were wiped out by that disease."" ""Has Rami Malek said that this season?"" asked my seatmate, referring to the 37-year-old actor, an Oscar front-runner, who plays the AIDS-afflicted Queen singer Freddie Mercury in ""Bohemian Rhapsody.""

The most controversial statement came later, when the ""Sorry to Bother You"" auteur Boots Riley won the Independent Spirit award for best first feature and used his speech not just to discuss class struggle but also to lob an accusation about rising tensions in Venezuela. ""I want to say the C.I.A. is trying to have a coup in Venezuela,"" Riley told the crowd. ""We should all be putting our voices out there to stop the U.S. from having regime change for oil."" At that, even the Independent Spirits broadcast cut Riley off.

Later, as Barry Jenkins took the stage to accept a best-director trophy for his James Baldwin adaptation ""If Beale Street Could Talk,"" he professed some uneasiness about winning in a category in which the majority of nominees were female. Notably, all of those women -- Debra Granik, who directed ""Leave No Trace,"" Tamara Jenkins, who directed ""Private Life,"" and Lynne Ramsay, who made ""You Were Never Really Here"" -- were all overlooked by Oscar. ""I'm not gonna lie, man: I didn't want to win this damn award,"" Jenkins said at the podium. He noted that though women only made up a tiny minority of big-studio directors last year, they comprised more than 40 percent of the directors in competition at Sundance and 60 percent of the nominees in his category, suggesting a pipeline to major projects that is still stalled by sexism. Jenkins exhorted the crowd of industry figures to make a film in the next 18 months with a woman at the helm, an echo of the challenge issued by the industry group Time's Up, then gave a particular shout-out to Ramsay, whom he met in 2002 at the Telluride Film Festival. ""I was a student, I hadn't made anything and she was so kind to me and took the time to tell me what her process was,"" Jenkins said. ""I think this award has your DNA in it, my dear."" Though the show had plenty of contemplative, heavy moments, the most delightful came late in the ceremony when Glenn Close won her latest best-actress trophy for ""The Wife."" As Close walked to the stage, she turned back and beckoned someone from her table to join her. She was not calling on a co-star, or the film's director. Instead, she was motioning to her dog, Pippi, a Havanese who eagerly trotted to the stage alongside his owner. ""I hope you don't mind that Pippi came up here with me,"" Close said, explaining, ""He's my date."" Pippi stared up at Close with reverence -- give or take an entirely excusable yawn or two -- then walked to the back of the stage to sit next to presenters Javier Bardem and Yalitza Aparicio as Close had her moment. A dog who could hit his marks and cede the spotlight when need be?

Sports,Chargers' Defense Stifles Ravens in Wild-Card Playoff Win,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/sports/chargers-ravens-nfl-playoffs.html,"BALTIMORE -- The Baltimore Ravens' startling charge into the playoffs was spurred by something perhaps even more surprising: a radical, run-first style of offense led by the rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson. Baltimore's unconventional style of attack in the midst of a pass-happy N.F.L. era rescued the Ravens, who won six of their final seven regular-season games. And the most impressive victory in that stretch was a 12-point romp over the Chargers in Los Angeles in Week 16. In the end, however, the defeat of the Chargers was the Ravens' undoing in their rematch here Sunday in an A.F.C. wild-card playoff game. In the week leading up to Sunday's contest, the Chargers dissected the videotape of the Ravens' Dec. 22 triumph in Los Angeles until every play and, more important, the alignments before every play were committed to memory. The Chargers' defensive coaches schooled the players on every Ravens tendency and tried a daring lineup that included seven defensive backs instead of the usual four or five.

The study and the strategy worked. Until a late rally in the final minutes, Baltimore's new-look offense had just 3 points and three first downs. Jackson was challenged and confounded into a dreadful performance as Los Angeles built a commanding lead and held on to upset the Ravens, 23-17. ""We had better reads on their formations, and we saw things coming,"" Chargers defensive end Joey Bosa said in the winning locker room. ""It really was kind of a blessing to have played them and seen them just a few weeks ago."" The Chargers' defensive approach forced Jackson into three fumbles -- one of which he lost -- and an interception. He was sacked seven times. ""You could see we were frustrating them,"" Los Angeles cornerback Casey Hayward Jr. said. ""They were confused. What had been working for them was not working.""

Los Angeles, which has won its last seven road games, will travel to New England to face the Patriots in a divisional-round game Sunday at 1 p.m.

For the Chargers, the rare alignment of seven defensive backs, which replaced bulky linebackers with smaller, fleet defenders, was a risk. But it was intended to thwart Jackson's advanced rushing skills. ""Lamar is so fast, we wanted our fastest guys defending him, even if it meant smaller guys,"" Lynn said. ""We didn't know if it would work, but we wanted to take a look at it. ""We were definitely ready to move onto a different defensive grouping if it didn't work. But it did."" Indeed, it was effective immediately and set the tone for the game. On the first play from scrimmage, Jackson kept the football and tried to dash around right end. He was tackled for a 1-yard loss by safety Derwin James. ""The first time we played them, we played their game,"" he said. ""Today, we played our game.""

For the Ravens, the loss brought a sudden end to a season marked by drastic change. The longtime Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco was overtaken by Jackson, who remains the franchise's top quarterback moving forward. John Harbaugh, whose job as Baltimore's head coach had seemed in jeopardy until the late surge by the Ravens, still may not remain. Flacco did not comment on his future Sunday, although he insisted that he did not think he should have replaced Jackson as the Ravens fell behind Los Angeles by 17 points. Harbaugh also declined to discuss his own future in detail.

""No one can say what tomorrow is going to bring,"" Harbaugh said. ""We'll see. I have every expectation to be here as long as they want me here."" The victory was also a subtle but authoritative accomplishment by the veteran Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers, who was appearing in his 10th postseason game. Rivers, who completed 22 of 32 passes, coolly and carefully led the Los Angeles offense on six scoring drives against the N.F.L.'s top-ranked defense. Rivers did not throw an interception and was sacked just once. And while the Chargers lost one fumble, they were otherwise judicious with the football and exhibited the kind of ball-control offense that had been Baltimore's bread and butter in its charge to the playoffs. Advancing cautiously for most of the game, Los Angeles kicked four field goals to take a 12-0 halftime lead. In the third quarter, a Chargers turnover and a blocked punt by the Ravens gave Baltimore a brief surge of momentum. But the Ravens could turn the miscues into only 3 points when a fumble recovery by C. J. Mosley led to a 33-yard Justin Tucker field goal. After the Ravens' Buck Allen partially blocked a punt and gave Baltimore good field position, the possession led only to a 50-yard field-goal attempt that Tucker missed.

On the ensuing Chargers possession, a 28-yard pass from Rivers to Mike Williams, followed by a 14-yard run by Melvin Gordon, set up a third down from the Ravens' 1-yard line. Gordon was tripped and fell just before the goal line; the play was ruled a touchdown until it was overturned by video replay. On the subsequent fourth-down play, Gordon bulled into the end zone. The Chargers completed a 2-point conversion to extend their lead to 20-3. At this point, fans at M&T Bank Stadium began chanting Flacco's name. Jackson remained in the game, but his presence elicited a chorus of boos from the crowd. That displeasure intensified when Jackson was twice sacked on a three-and-out series. But on the next series, Jackson awakened and tossed a 31-yard touchdown pass to Michael Crabtree with 6 minutes 33 seconds remaining in the fourth quarter. On the Ravens' next possession, Jackson connected with Crabtree again, throwing a 7-yard touchdown pass that cut the Chargers' lead to 23-17 with 1:59 left. The Ravens did get the football for a final series, but their comeback ended when Jackson was stripped of the football as he was preparing to pass. The fumble was recovered by the Chargers' Melvin Ingram, who dominated the Ravens' offensive line throughout Sunday's game. Ingram had seven tackles and two sacks. ""This was and was not a typical game for us,"" Rivers said afterward. ""Because we've had all kinds of victories -- ugly ones, pretty ones, good games offensively and good games defensively. That's just us. But mostly, I think we're a pretty good team.""",Five field goals fueled Los Angeles's sluggish win on the road against Baltimore.,5250eb92-fe6a-5e10-92a3-0fc3f4b86a78,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/07/sports/07ravens-web-ingram/07ravens-web-ingram-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4d048fba6f754e258c3a6e56bf6c92586b0cbca7be01a665bae97c399f6a4037&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Melvin Ingram accounted for two sacks as the Los Angeles Chargers' defense overwhelmed Lamar Jackson of the Baltimore Ravens for three quarters.,5250eb92-fe6a-5e10-92a3-0fc3f4b86a78,N24News/imgs/5250eb92-fe6a-5e10-92a3-0fc3f4b86a78.jpg,9

""How are you going to kill me today?"" she purrs. Not only does he do so, but he also takes care to leave incriminating evidence everywhere around her place -- daring his minions and superiors to find him guilty. (Is the killer an ""idiot"" or what, one investigator wonders.)

Style,The Doorman at the Mudd Club Tells All,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/style/mudd-club-doorman-bowie-basquiat.html,"In the world of Manhattan night life, the doorman occupies the role of St. Peter. Heaven awaits inside, but to join the party you must first pass through the figure standing in judgment. To be rejected by the doorman is to momentarily feel as if your whole life has been lived in error. You have been judged unworthy. How almost heartening, then, to read Richard Boch's new memoir, ""The Mudd Club"" (Feral House), and hear the author confess to feeling insecure and to wanting to join the cool crowd when he worked the door at the seminal punk rock club.

Mr. Boch moved from his native Long Island to New York City in 1976 to be an artist. He rented an apartment in Greenwich Village, and registered for graduate studies at New York University, but never attended. Instead, he did drugs, worked on his art and ran around with fellow artists and musicians downtown.

In the fall of 1978, he made his way to the newly opened Mudd Club for the first time. Four months later, the owner, Steve Mass, hired him as a doorman there -- a job that lasted 21 months but that seems to have resonated for a lifetime. He is known to many even today as ""Richard from the Mudd Club."" ""Everything about the Mudd Club washed off on me, it never really went away,"" Mr. Boch said last month, in a booth at the Roxy Hotel in TriBeCa, not far from his old job site.

Amos Poe, a filmmaker and a regular from the beginning, said of the place: ""It was a dysfunctional circus that functioned. When Ronnie Cutrone said, 'I want to put a cage in there and put women in the cage,' there wasn't a question about insurance problems. Steve would say, 'Yeah, that's great.'"" Mr. Boch took his job as the gatekeeper to the show seriously. He described his process for assessing the crowd bunched out front on a Saturday night: ""If you started saying, 'How long do we have to wait?' that was a strike against you. If you said, 'Is there a line?' that was a strike against you. If you said to me, God forbid, 'Studio 54 lets us in,' that was the kiss of death.""

In his book, Mr. Boch recounts how Mr. Mass told him to not let in limousine-riding hotshots like Mick Jagger and David Bowie. Rejecting the world's most famous rock stars was a task the 25-year-old doorman was unable to do, he said, giving both men wide berth when they showed up. In atonement, he recalled how one night he turned away Meat Loaf.

Mr. Boch elevated the doorman role to a performance. He exuded a ""nervous energy of authority"" and deployed ""acid humor,"" Mr. Poe said, to critique the crowd and play social experiments. Mr. Poe recalled watching one night as Mr. Boch told a pretty young woman she could come in, but her Wall Street-looking boyfriend had to stay outside: a merciless test of her loyalties. In 1980, two and a half years before it closed, Mr. Boch quit the Mudd Club, partly out of self-preservation. ""I was using a lot of drugs,"" he said. ""My next job was the Peppermint Lounge, where I lasted six months. I was fired. I was out of control."" He cleaned up and went on to work as a manager for various restaurants and clubs in the city. In 2004, he sold his loft in TriBeCa for a bundle and relocated upstate (he keeps an apartment on the Upper West Side). Unlike some of his friends, Mr. Boch didn't emerge from the scene a famous artist. His career got sidetracked after he became Richard from the Mudd Club. But Mr. Boch's tenure as doorman may have been a creative endeavor itself. ""Richard's job was to collect stories,"" Mr. Poe said. ""He was a sponge soaking in that stuff, but eventually, you're going to have to squeeze that sponge out."" ""When people would talk to me back then, I would always say, 'Identify me as an artist first, who works the door of the Mudd Club.' Because just being the Mudd Club doorman, I bristled at that,"" he said. ""Now I've written this book. Everything I'm doing, I'm identifying myself as 'Mudd Club doorman.' In retrospect, I'm incredibly proud of having that job.""","With his memoir ""The Mudd Club,"" Richard Boch revisits the punk rock venue that drew Bowie, Basquiat and a generation of downtown artists.",08841f8b-da1e-509b-ab7d-9b68f2b2ceda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/25/fashion/25MUDDCLUB2/25MUDDCLUB2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=84a55fad0bcb556a5b6f8ebd75c8b7bba19afd2cdfdf430e9de333bd7f708a97&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Richard Boch outside of the Mudd Club in 1979, in a photograph featured in his memoir, ""The Mudd Club.""",08841f8b-da1e-509b-ab7d-9b68f2b2ceda,N24News/imgs/08841f8b-da1e-509b-ab7d-9b68f2b2ceda.jpg,15
Theater,"Review: In 'A Man of Good Hope,' a Boy Wonders if America Is His Refuge",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/theater/review-in-a-man-of-good-hope-a-boy-wonders-if-america-is-his-refuge.html,"Directed by Mark Dornford-May, the play had its world premiere in Cape Town last year. It unfurls on a steeply raked stage bordered by corrugated metal and surrounded by seven large marimbas. The 25-member ensemble strokes and strikes them with choreographed verve, accompanying arias and Pan-African pop. Much of the show is sung, and a lot of it is dynamically danced, in styles that change depending on Asad's travels but that usually feature articulated elbows and percussive feet.

Asad is portrayed by four actors -- first a boy, then a woman, then two adult men. The rest of the ensemble covers multiple roles, sometimes oppressors and sometimes oppressed, which is part of what makes the show so powerful. Most of the company members are drawn from townships like those in which Asad experienced such brutality. With their frank and flexible acting, they show how easily a person might slide from vulnerability to cruelty and how a seemingly laudable goal, the desire of black South Africans to achieve equality with their white countrymen and women, can curdle into an ugly xenophobia.

Of course, such problems don't end at South Africa's borders. Try not to shiver when you hear one man rail against immigrants: ""You know what they do. They steal our jobs, they take our women. They bring crime wherever they go.""

But ""A Man of Good Hope"" is less an indictment of callousness than it is a profound act of empathy and a reminder of what a mighty force empathy in the theater can be. Asad is no cardboard saint. He's shortsighted, impolitic and quick to snatch a fast buck. He's exceptional only in his persistence. Yet he demands our compassion and our recognition of the simple humane truth that no one should have to live in such danger and with such fear. (This ought to be required viewing for anyone keen on recent executive orders.)

The ending of the play is vexing in its ambiguity. (Those searching for a more definite coda can turn to Mr. Steinberg's book.) Will Asad and his family make it to America? If they do what will they find there -- the trucks Asad dreamed of as a boy or the guns and the gangs? What will it mean if the travel ban is reworked and America closes its golden door to other refugees?","Asad is a refugee whose refuge keeps receding, in this music drama, directed by Mark Dornford-May, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.",8498dc78-1315-5d51-8d21-57b454bf723e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/17/arts/17GOODHOPE/17GOODHOPE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c39615b5c04a6639c915f11401f49ab69a93902f148cd669eb5592748ec328f4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from left: Pauline Malefane, Ayanda Tikolo and Siphosethu Juta in ""A Man of Good Hope"" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.",8498dc78-1315-5d51-8d21-57b454bf723e,N24News/imgs/8498dc78-1315-5d51-8d21-57b454bf723e.jpg,10
Books,"The Director André Gregory Has Written a Memoir, but He Says He Hasn't",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/books/review/this-is-not-my-memoir-andre-gregory.html,"THIS IS NOT MY MEMOIR

By Andre Gregory and Todd London

Among the revolutionary stage troupes of the 1960s and '70s that sought to displace tidy naturalist plays with a theater of miracles -- Julian Beck and Judith Malina's Living Theater, Joseph Chaikin's Open Theater, Charles Ludlam's Ridiculous Theatrical Company, Richard Foreman's Ontological-Hysteric Theater -- none was more inventive or exciting than Andre Gregory's Manhattan Project. In its legendary adaptation of ""Alice in Wonderland,"" actors dispensed with props or sets and transformed themselves into caterpillars, fell down nonexistent holes and made theater magic.

A candid personal memoir detailing the long career and life experience of the brilliantly accomplished Gregory would certainly be welcome, and this book marvelously fills the bill -- or would, if its author had not so perversely insisted by its title that it was not his memoir, without offering much of an explanation why not. I suppose we ought to take him at his word. Still, as the saying goes, if it looks like a duck, waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck. ...

Regardless, Gregory is a masterly storyteller and chronicler. Eschewing the usual stale showbiz anecdotes, his perfectly timed narratives are spiced with wit, self-deprecating humor and shrewd analytical insight. He spares no sentimentality for childhood. Born to a pair of Russian Jews who hopped from Berlin to Paris to London to New York, one step ahead of the Nazis, he says: ""My parents were great survivors, but they were wretched parents, negligent and self-absorbed, petty and often mean."" They left his upbringing to his nanny. Summering in Southern California, the father, who had become wealthy in Weimar Berlin, hobnobbed with movie stars before falling into bipolar depression. His mother, who ""certainly had something,"" including affairs with Errol Flynn and Bugsy Siegel, utterly lacked maternal instinct. Once, she found herself ""admiring a baby in a carriage. She said to the governess, 'What a beautiful baby.' The governess replied, 'But Madame, it's yours.'"" Is it any wonder he grew up ""stunted in the art of loving""?

As befits having been in therapy most of his adult life, he is nothing if not self-aware about his failures and failings. Indeed, humiliation forms an almost zestfully comic through-line in these recollections. After graduating from Harvard, he applies to Yale Drama School, but is told by the dean: ""The theater is impossible enough if you do have talent, but if you don't. ... Become a lawyer [was my father speaking through him?] or a doctor."" So he joins the Army. ""We ran across fields holding bayonets and screaming, 'KILL KILL.' ... On breaks, aspiring gentile that I was, I would memorize psalms."" Young, he marries the beautiful Chiquita, and they quarrel on their honeymoon and for the next 33 years.","In ""This Is Not My Memoir,"" the co-star of ""My Dinner With André"" remembers his many theatrical provocations.",e9ff3191-a046-5c93-a6c4-1653e455db04,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/books/06Lopate1/17Lopate1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=4928e4433d50095f32f94726b100b396895d48131f0dbfd973bc04c4b2c75956&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Andr&eacute; Gregory, left, and Wallace Shawn at the Public Theater in 2013.",e9ff3191-a046-5c93-a6c4-1653e455db04,N24News/imgs/e9ff3191-a046-5c93-a6c4-1653e455db04.jpg,13
Science,"For Neanderthals, Growing Big Brains Took More Time",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/21/science/neanderthal-brain-growth.html,"The skeleton of an 8-year-old Neanderthal boy recovered from the El Sidron cave in Spain.

We modern humans like to boast about our big brains, but the Neanderthals seem to have had even larger ones. A recent analysis of a 49,000-year-old skeleton belonging to a Neanderthal child suggests a surprising difference between them and us: Neanderthal brains appear to have grown to maturity more slowly than those of Homo sapiens. Developing a clearer understanding of the reasons for the similarities and differences in Neanderthal and Homo sapiens growth patterns could one day help scientists better understand our evolutionary history and how we came to be as we are today. ""What we saw is that it took longer for them to get their big brains,"" said Antonio Rosas, a paleoanthropologist from The National Museum of Natural Sciences in Madrid and lead author of the study, which was published Thursday in Science.

Dr. Rosas and his team studied ancient Neanderthal remains recovered from a cave system in Spain known as El Sidron, where archaeologists have found the remains of more than a dozen individuals, including the child's mother and younger brother. The first thing the researchers needed to do with their child specimen was determine how old he was. So they peeked inside his mouth, which had a mix of 30 baby and adult teeth. By cutting into his teeth they were able to use a microscope to count bands in the enamel, which grow similarly to tree rings. From their investigation they determined the child was just under eight years old when he died. They did not find any signs on his bones that would have clued them into the cause of his death. By investigating the boy's cranium, the researchers found that it was only 87.5 percent the size of a full grown Neanderthal's cranium. That differs from anatomically modern human children, who at age seven have craniums that are about 95 percent the size of an adult's.

Though the team did not have the child's complete skull, they were able to compare the available fragments with a skull from a different Neanderthal and reconstruct the missing parts. The team also found the Neanderthal child still had several unfused vertebrae. In modern human children, those vertebrae are fused around the ages of four to six. Despite the differences in brain and spine development, the team found that in many ways the Neanderthal child was no different from a modern human child, especially in the elbows, wrists, hands and knees. Both seem to have experienced similar growth patterns, like having arms and legs that grew slowly between infancy and puberty, according to Dr. Rosas.","New research suggests that the brain of a juvenile Neanderthal developed more slowly than that of a similarly aged Homo sapiens child, but scientists don't yet know why.",204bee96-dbbb-5749-aa79-d3ee18d553d7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/22/science/22TB-NEANDERTHAL1/22TB-NEANDERTHAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=93fade93568c8b6347fb8ed882e848515523407bc66770724d0b5fb4b55b26ad&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The skeleton of an 8-year-old Neanderthal boy recovered from the El Sidrón cave in Spain.,204bee96-dbbb-5749-aa79-d3ee18d553d7,N24News/imgs/204bee96-dbbb-5749-aa79-d3ee18d553d7.jpg,2
