Economy,Federal Tax Cuts Leave States in a Bind,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/12/business/economy/state-tax.html,"The Crystal Court in the IDS Center in downtown Minneapolis. The state estimates that without legislative action, Minnesotans could pay $400 million more in state taxes next year because of the new federal law.

The federal tax overhaul cut taxes for millions of American families and businesses. But the law also had an unintended effect: raising the state-tax bite in nearly every state that has an income tax. Now, governors and state legislators are contending with how to adjust their own tax codes to shield their residents from paying more or, in some cases, whether to apply any of the unexpected revenue windfall to other priorities instead. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which President Trump signed into law in December, did not directly affect state budgets. It cut federal tax rates, but also made other changes that mean more income will be subject to taxation. Because most states use federal definitions of income and have not adjusted their own rates, the federal changes will have big consequences for both state budgets and taxpayers. ""Residents of the majority of states would experience an unlegislated tax increase,"" said Jared Walczak, an analyst with the Tax Foundation, a conservative think tank.

In Minnesota, the state estimates that residents could pay more than $400 million in additional state taxes in the next fiscal year because of the new federal law. That has set off a fight over how to respond. The state's Democratic governor wants to give most of that money back to Minnesotans through tax cuts aimed at low- and moderate-income families; the Republican-controlled legislature wants broader-based tax cuts. Both sides say they must resolve the issue before the legislative session ends May 21. Apart from the nine states with no broad-based income tax, nearly every state will face a similar decision. Almost all of the states base their tax codes in some way on federal definitions of income, before applying their own adjustments and deductions and setting their own tax rates. The federal tax overhaul, which eliminated or capped several deductions and exemptions, effectively broadened what counts as income for some families. Previously, for example, a married couple with three children earning $70,000 might have been taxed on only about $36,000 of that income, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group. The tax law, however, eliminated the so-called personal exemption and made other changes, which could increase this family's taxable income to about $46,000. At the federal level, those changes were more than offset for most families by lower tax rates and an increased child tax credit. In the example of a married couple with three children, the family's federal tax bill would be lowered by more than $2,000 under the law. At the state level, however, the changes leave families owing tax on a larger share of their income, without the reduced rates or new credits to soften the blow.

The challenge is especially acute in Minnesota because its tax code is closely tied to the federal definitions. The Minnesota Department of Revenue estimates that if the state tax code incorporates the federal change in calculating taxable income, 870,000 Minnesota families will pay more for the 2018 tax year, by an average of $489 per person. In theory, Minnesota could try to maintain its status quo by simply leaving its taxes linked to the previous federal definitions. But that would force taxpayers to calculate their income under two different systems.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""If we do nothing, then it becomes very difficult for our citizens to file taxes,"" said Roger Chamberlain, a Republican state senator who heads the body's tax committee. Beyond an agreement that something must be done, the consensus breaks down. The State Senate recently passed a plan, backed by Mr. Chamberlain, that would cut rates and impose an automatic trigger that would lower taxes further anytime the state runs a budget surplus -- a move Democrats call fiscally irresponsible. The House, which is also controlled by Republicans, previously passed a tax cut of its own.

Mark Dayton, Minnesota's Democratic governor, has taken a different approach, proposing new tax credits for low- and moderate-income residents, while raising taxes on businesses. A recent Department of Revenue analysis found that Minnesotans would pay $91.5 million more under the governor's tax plan -- which includes some proposals unrelated to the federal law -- with the entire burden falling on the 10 percent of taxpayers with the highest incomes. Cynthia Bauerly, the state revenue commissioner, said no wage earner would pay more in taxes under the governor's plan. Business groups have criticized the governor's proposal, which they argue would make Minnesota less competitive. Some progressive groups say the state should go further, using the extra revenue generated by the federal law to fund a paid family-leave program or childhood savings accounts. ""This is exactly the kind of thing you could use to start the core investment of a program like that,"" said Chris Conry, strategic campaigns director for TakeAction Minnesota, a liberal advocacy group. ""You could give every kid born in Minnesota $500 at birth."" Similar debates are playing out in statehouses across the country, in a few different ways. In some states, the state tax code automatically incorporates changes to federal law; for those states, doing nothing probably means an automatic tax increase on residents unless their legislatures take action. In other states, including Minnesota, such updates are not automatic. So legislatures must pass so-called conformity bills that adopt some or all of the federal changes, or else leave residents to contend with possibly conflicting tax systems.

Some state tax systems are linked more closely to the federal tax code than others. The difference lies in how states define income for the purposes of their tax calculations. Most states, including Maine and California, start with adjusted gross income, Line 37 on a standard 1040 form. Any federal provisions that get applied farther down the 1040 form -- like itemized deductions -- do not affect those states' tax collections. But a handful of states, including Minnesota, base their tax codes on federal taxable income, Line 43 on the 1040 form. And what goes on between those two lines is where most of the changes passed by Congress will be felt, resulting in a higher taxable income for many families. (A few states apply a hybrid of the two methods.) Even in states that are less affected, failing to adapt their tax codes to the federal law could make it hard for residents to figure out what they owe -- and, in some cases, force them to pay more. The longer states wait, the less time residents, businesses and state tax officials have to adapt to the new rules before next year's filing season. ""Inaction becomes action this time,"" said Richard C. Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center. ""People's taxes will change, states' revenues will change."" Several factors are complicating the issue for states. Congress passed its tax overhaul late in the year and with minimal debate, giving states relatively little time to assess the effects and plan a response. Even now, the full impact on state budgets is not clear, meaning legislatures are deciding how to take advantage of a revenue stream that could fall short of estimates. In addition, most of the changes to the individual tax code expire after several years, further muddling states' plans. Moreover, the tax debate is hitting as state budgets are strained by rising health care and pension costs, among other factors. Those strains could worsen in coming years if the federal government cuts back funding -- perhaps because of deficits caused, in part, by the tax law itself. And states, unlike the federal government, generally cannot plug budget holes by running deficits. That makes the unexpected revenue from the tax law a fiscal temptation.

""For states, this is about as good as it's going to get,"" said Nicholas Johnson of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. ""We're overdue for a recession, which always hit state budgets hard."" State officials, however, have mostly avoided calling for using the extra tax revenue to increase spending. Much of the base-broadening in the federal law comes from the elimination of the personal exemption, which primarily benefited families with multiple children. Few politicians want to advocate raising taxes on parents. ""That's your windfall, a tax increase on large families,"" Mr. Auxier said.","The federal tax law had the unintended effect of giving states a tax windfall. Now, states must weigh whether to spend the money or give it back to residents.",a0909cf9-0be5-5e45-ae61-a0af1050a2ee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/13/business/13STATETAX-2-print/13STATETAX-2-print-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=234d6d62294fdab5e8e84f078bcb92489ef1460687419093e806c1fa1fc77948&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Customers in a Minneapolis cafe.

Dance,Sending the Trisha Brown Legacy Back Into the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/24/arts/dance/sending-the-trisha-brown-legacy-back-into-the-world.html,"Once upon a time, a choreographer made dances, and extraordinary ones at that. Her works, full of wit and rigor, unfolded on rooftops and rafts and even on the sides of buildings as well as in lofts and galleries, and later on proscenium stages. And then she couldn't make them anymore. When Trisha Brown received a diagnosis of vascular dementia, it meant that she could no longer lead her company or choreograph. In 2009, she told her executive director, Barbara Dufty, and other colleagues at the Trisha Brown Dance Company that she wanted them to continue if they could. (Today she is 79 and lives in Texas.) For dance companies that seek to exist beyond their founding choreographer, there is the inevitable conundrum. How does a company exist without new works? The Merce Cunningham Dance Company disbanded when faced with that prospect; others, like the Martha Graham Dance Company, evolved into repertory groups. But the Brown company, which has seven members, is trying something different: remounting Ms. Brown's works in site-specific locations all over the world.

After the company winds down its three-year tour of ""Proscenium Works, 1979-2011,"" with appearances at the Brooklyn Academy of Music beginning Thursday, Jan. 28, and in Seattle in February, the group plans to focus on a performance model called ""Trisha Brown: In Plain Site."" For the company's associate artistic directors, the veteran dancers Carolyn Lucas and Diane Madden, both handpicked by Ms. Brown, it's a chance to continue in a creative vein, by restaging Ms. Brown's task-based early dances from the 1960s and '70s and excerpts from her later repertory in settings that both reframe the work and yield a new intimacy. (In Jerusalem, for example, the company presented a version of ""In Plain Site"" that flowed through two levels of the modern wing of the Israel Museum.)

""We're not going to say we know where we're going to end up,"" Ms. Madden said. ""What we're saying is that we know this work, we have it in our pocket, we know how it works, we know the different performance sites and what that generates. We have her history."" In its three-day ""Proscenium"" run at the Brooklyn Academy, the company will perform ""Set and Reset"" (1983), ""Present Tense"" (2003) -- a reconstruction -- and ""Newark (Niweweorce)"" (1987). Ms. Lucas said she found it difficult to grasp that this might be the last time she would see ""Newark"" danced by the company but that she was trying to look ahead to the challenge of revisiting other pieces. ""We're very committed to embracing new ways of performing the work, and even though it's a bit undefined, I'm feeling good about that,"" she said. ""It reminds me of Trisha a little bit -- we're learning from process. I want for the work that we do to evolve also so that we're not going into a rut, so to speak, of presenting Trisha's work in just one way."" After the performances in Brooklyn and Seattle, the company plans to focus on education and on organizing its archives as well as the ""In Plain Site"" initiative. Ms. Brown's work will continue to be licensed and performed by other companies, including the Paris Opera Ballet, the Lyon Opera Ballet and the Pennsylvania Ballet; since those groups are not schooled in Ms. Brown's approach, the licensing projects require extensive teaching. And in March, the Stephen Petronio Company will present ""Glacial Decoy,"" Ms. Brown's first work for the proscenium stage, at the Joyce Theater. (Mr. Petronio, who joined Ms. Brown's company in 1979, was its first male dancer.)

Like many of her colleagues in postmodern dance, Ms. Brown was inspired by everyday movement. Though rigorous, much of her choreography is silky; instead of being powered by muscles, it seems to flow through the body like liquid. Repertory and classes concentrating on her cultivated movements are already part of the curriculum at institutions like the Performing Arts Research and Training Studios in Brussels and the dance department of Bard College, where the troupe is engaged in a two-year partnership. Ms. Madden said that her main focus at the moment was on education: ""So there's this question about technique,"" she said. ""Can contemporary dance have a technique, or is it antithetical to what it is?""

The archives include 50 years of materials, including indispensable videos of rehearsals in which Ms. Brown was choreographing. (Happily, she recorded everything.) Cori Olinghouse, a former dancer with the company who is the creative director of the archives, wants the material to be seen as a guide to artmaking. While teaching at Bard last semester, Ms. Olinghouse had her students keep visual notebooks, as Ms. Brown did, featuring choreographic drawings and notes. ""We're really trying to place value on how Trisha intuitively captured her own creative and building process,"" she said. Finally, ""In Plain Site"" is a way of freeing Ms. Brown's dances from the limitations of a set stage by altering spacing, location and more. The company has already experimented with this in relatively tame ways in New York -- at the Judd Foundation in SoHo last May and at Wagner Park in Lower Manhattan in June -- but more ambitiously in Europe. In Italy, one performance was held in two locations, with audience members riding bicycles from one site to the other. Stanford Makishi, a former dancer with the company who is now on its board, said the idea meshed well with Ms. Brown's history. ""I think this is kind of a novel approach -- in a strange way, to almost go back to the beginning of the company, into galleries and open fields,"" he said. ""To come back out of the proscenium in a way, which is where Trisha began.""

He noted that not every choreographer had that option. But much of Ms. Brown's work, Ms. Lucas and Ms. Madden have discovered, is malleable and, at times, can be broken into segments. One is ""Geometry of Quiet"" (2003), which Ms. Lucas plans to teach company dancers. ""It's maybe the most creative possibility while sticking to the artistic director's vision, which is hard to guess,"" Mr. Makishi said. ""We don't know what Trisha might have done, but there are certain wishes that she had about having her work seen that this at least honors and, hence, honors her."" Jamie Scott, a company member and former Merce Cunningham dancer, said that while she would miss performing Ms. Brown's dances on a grand scale, she had enjoyed the human connection of the more intimate ""In Plain Site"" presentations. ""Her work is so witty and humorous in its precision and its exactitude that there are times when that really comes out,"" she said. Conversely, the more formal proscenium pieces headed to the Brooklyn Academy of Music have an elegiac end-of-an-era quality that Ms. Scott, as a dancer who experienced the Cunningham company's final performances at the Park Avenue Armory in 2011, is familiar with. ""But this time I'm not as nervous,"" she said. ""Doors opened last time, so I feel like doors will open again.""","After stops at the Brooklyn Academy of Music and in Seattle, the ailing choreographer's company will focus on intimate works and education.",837d5e64-ddab-5258-b701-d65ce7292291,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/24/arts/24TRISHA1/24TRISHA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=fed4fb499882d291261aa44cbd4c453eac234a4038519f902abbecc3f31abb45&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Stuart Shugg, Cecily Campbell and Leah Ives rehearsing Trisha Brown's ""Present Tense,"" part of the ""Proscenium Works"" program coming to the Brooklyn Academy of Music.",837d5e64-ddab-5258-b701-d65ce7292291,N24News/imgs/837d5e64-ddab-5258-b701-d65ce7292291.jpg,6

North Carolina State and Virginia Tech, who were to play an Atlantic Coast Conference game on Sept. 12, said Wednesday that the matchup had been delayed by two weeks, until Sept. 26, because of a cluster of virus cases within N.C. State's athletic department.

The rescheduling decision was a bleak and unsurprising reminder of the season's perils, and similar moves could become common in the weeks ahead.

Food,"Niven Patel, a Miami Chef, Is Not Giving Up on 2020",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/10/dining/chef-niven-patel-mamey-coral-gables.html,"Niven Patel, a Miami Chef, Is Not Giving Up on 2020

CORAL GABLES, Fla. -- The last week in July was an especially stressful one for Niven Patel, and for Floridians in general. It began with Mr. Patel's decision to permanently close one of two locations of Ghee Indian Kitchen, the Miami-area restaurant that brought the chef national acclaim. The week ended with South Florida bracing for the arrival of Hurricane Isaias, just as the state recorded its fourth straight day of record reported deaths from Covid-19. In the midst of all of this -- while still adjusting to having become a father to twin daughters in June -- Mr. Patel was busy with final preparations for the opening of a new restaurant called Mamey. Doing so in a pandemic, he conceded, is ""pretty insane.""

The openings were put on hold in March, when city and county officials shut down Miami-area restaurants; so was that of a permanent location for Erba, a pasta restaurant owned by Mr. Patel that had a popular run as a pop-up in 2019. The photo shoot for a Food & Wine article on the top chefs was also in March -- a day after Mr. Patel laid off all 64 of his employees. ""It's why I'm not smiling,"" he said. Two of those workers were farmers who tended to Rancho Patel, the two-acre farm that surrounds his family's house in Homestead, about 30 miles south of Coral Gables. Weeds have since taken over the swath of tilled land in the backyard where he grew produce and herbs for Ghee Indian Kitchen. ""We can do some serious damage with this plot,"" Mr. Patel said as he kicked at rocks in the soil one evening. He recently hired Roberto Grossman, a farmer in Homestead, to revive Rancho Patel. ""We just need to put some love back into it.""

Mr. Alkassar, 33, had his laptop open to renderings of what the restaurant will look like by next week, after all of the design elements are in place: Foliage covers the ceiling above low-hanging light shades in the two dining rooms, and potted palm trees appear where boxes of takeout containers were stacked chest-high. ""It was a big investment -- a couple hundred thousand dollars -- when we were making the last finishing touches on Mamey,"" Mr. Alkassar said. ""One of the conversations we had to have is, do we make that final investment? When we're not even going to open for inside dining?"" He said the company's decision to proceed with Mamey and Orno, which is now scheduled to open early next year with a menu focused on local ingredients cooked in a wood-burning oven, was a vote of confidence in Mr. Patel, as well as in the hotel. The development is across the street from the University of Miami, which begins in-person classes on Monday.

The test included a coconut-lime ceviche of Florida wahoo, summer rolls filled with pickled shiitakes and fresh avocado, and a jerk chicken sandwich with jackfruit barbecue sauce. Tim Piazza, the executive chef for Mr. Patel's restaurant company, Aya Hospitality, still worried that some dishes were less suited to takeout than others. ""You want to be eating ceviche five minutes after you made it, not 45 minutes,"" he said. Mamey's playful, bright-flavored food is reminiscent of the culturally omnivorous, fruit-forward cuisine championed in Miami by chefs like Norman Van Aken, Cindy Hutson and Douglas Rodriguez in the 1990s and early 2000s. That often busy, Latin-Caribbean-inspired cooking was a dominant style in local fine dining in the 2010s, when chefs like Mr. Schwartz and Michelle Bernstein grabbed attention with simpler dishes at more modest, bistrolike restaurants. With Mamey, Mr. Patel joins a new generation of chefs -- Michael Beltran, the 34-year-old chef-owner of Ariete, is another prominent example -- who are reorienting Miami fine dining around cuisines brought to South Florida over the years by immigrants from Latin America and the Caribbean. They're doing so at a moment when others are looking at the cooking of Miami's recent past with fresh eyes. ""When I started, I said, 'I'm not going to put fruit on anything,'"" said Ms. Bernstein, 51, a Miami native whose restaurant in Little Havana, Cafe La Trova, is temporarily closed because of the coronavirus. ""I'm old enough where I've come around. Now I can't wait to brown butter and put mango in it.""

Brenda Perez took a job as a server at Mamey in part, she said, because of the cautious way Mr. Patel has managed the original Ghee. The chef ended indoor dining at the restaurant in early July, just before the county mandated it. ""The way they responded to the virus this entire time has been very responsible,"" said Ms. Perez, 37, whose boyfriend works at Ghee. ""They care about their employees and how they feel."" In June, as the coronavirus outbreak in Florida grew more worrisome, Mr. Patel and Mr. Alkassar asked Mr. Piazza, the restaurant group's executive chef, to quarantine at home. Mr. Piazza's wife had just tested positive for the coronavirus, as had their nanny and the nanny's husband. ""When this happened, Niven was like, 'Stay home,'"" Mr. Piazza said. Even after tests for his wife came back negative, though, the team insisted that Mr. Piazza remain home, to guarantee a healthy chef in case others fell sick. Mr. Piazza, whom Mr. Patel refers to as ""my right hand,"" has spent the time testing recipes and writing (and rewriting) menus for Mamey. ""'The hotel is a big deal for a lot of people,'"" Mr. Piazza said Mr. Patel told him. ""'You're the only guy who I would trust here if something happened to me.'""

Mr. Patel's team was still making adjustments on opening night. Salsa verde was added to the piri piri roast chicken. At the last minute, Mr. Patel decided to tuck a gerbera daisy into every branded takeout bag. With the THesis Hotel booked to over 60 percent capacity in its first week of business, there was even talk of growing Mamey's staff of 34 employees. Mr. Alkassar stood near the outdoor pool bar on the hotel's third floor, where diners ate protected from the rain. He has opened more than 20 restaurants, he said, and despite all the challenges, he can't remember another opening that went as smoothly as Mamey's. To prove his point, he pulled up a string of texts between Mr. Patel and himself on his smartphone. One from Mr. Patel read, ""Thanks for letting me always just be who I am.""","A return to indoor dining may be far off, but he just opened a new, Caribbean-inspired restaurant and is moving ahead with plans for others.",7d2d36ba-b1bd-5ea5-8dc0-1b87aac35b2f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/12/dining/12virus-patel1/merlin_175113192_dc4f0b5c-b5e0-4422-b7df-f170ded72ff6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=74f8b6d5a3213dada0e759e46f0f19f4e39ef326f7bc836b09ff71bd6229d230&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Niven Patel in the kitchen at Mamey, the new restaurant he opened last week in Coral Gables, Fla.

Economy,"Warren Wealth Tax Has Wide Support, Except Among One Group",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/29/business/economy/economy-politics-survey.html,"Senator Elizabeth Warren's plan to tax the assets of America's wealthiest individuals continues to draw broad support from voters, across party, gender and educational lines. Only one slice of the electorate opposes it staunchly: Republican men with college degrees. Not surprisingly, that is also the profile of many who'd be hit by Ms. Warren's so-called wealth tax, which has emerged as the breakout economic proposal in the Democratic presidential primary race.

Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont has also proposed a wealth tax, which would hit more taxpayers than Ms. Warren's version, and several other candidates have announced their own plans to raise taxes on the rich, with varying degrees of detail. The other policy plan dominating the primary debate so far -- the conversion to a government-financed health care system known as ""Medicare for all"" -- enjoys narrower support that breaks much more cleanly along party lines. Republicans overwhelmingly oppose it. Independents favor it two to one, and Democrats support it by an even higher ratio. As the Democratic contest barrels toward the first caucuses in Iowa and beyond, the polling continues to show a racial fissure on the subject of the economy, with nonwhite Democrats expressing more concern about their economic situations than white Democrats. Those more anxious voters are less likely to support Ms. Warren, or her wealth tax, a dynamic that could prove consequential as Democrats winnow their field. Here are three takeaways on Democratic voters, policy proposals and the role of the economy in the campaign.

The wealth tax has lost a few points of support since the last time The Times asked about the issue, in July. But it remains broadly popular, even more so than it was in February. Three-quarters of Democrats and more than half of Republicans say they approve of the idea of a 2 percent tax on wealth above $50 million. Support for a wealth tax cuts across many of the demographic dividing lines in American politics. Men and women like it. So do the young and the old. The proposal receives majority support among every major racial, educational and income group.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. College-educated Republican men, though, disapprove of it by a 15-point margin -- though a vast majority of Republican men with college degrees would have a net worth below the tax threshold. (College-educated Republican women approve of the policy by an even wider margin than their male counterparts oppose it.) One note that might give Republicans pause: The wealth tax is much more popular than the tax-cut package that President Trump signed in 2017, which only 45 percent of Americans in this Times survey said was a good move. That's a decline from April, when the law was drawing slightly more approval than disapproval. The movement against the Trump tax cuts since then has been powered, oddly enough, by Republicans. They largely still back the law -- by 76 percent over all, compared with 20 percent of Democrats -- but that support has dropped six percentage points since April.

Among Democrats, education has emerged as a key dividing line on economic policy. Ms. Warren's tax is overwhelmingly popular (86 percent support) with Democratic voters who have graduate degrees. Among voters with a high school diploma or less, the policy is still popular, but meaningfully less so, drawing 75 percent support. Accordingly, less-educated voters are also less likely to say they favor Ms. Warren on the economy. That fits with other polling that has found the Massachusetts senator struggling to win over voters without a college degree. Strikingly for a candidate who has put so much emphasis on the economy, Ms. Warren is viewed with caution by voters who care the most about the economy, and by those who are most worried about it. Among Democrats who say they are ""very concerned"" about losing their job, for example, 15 percent say they would trust Ms. Warren most on the economy out of all the Democratic candidates, compared with 23 percent of other Democratic voters. Those struggles for Ms. Warren may partly reflect another important divide in the Democratic electorate: race. Black and Hispanic voters tend to rate the economy more highly as an issue than their white counterparts. They are also less likely to trust Ms. Warren on the economy. Black and Hispanic voters are more likely to choose former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. as the candidate they would trust on the economy. So are voters who say they are concerned about their jobs or their economic prospects. But voters' preferences don't fall neatly along ideological lines: Those same groups also tend to give high ratings to Mr. Sanders, who is closer to Ms. Warren than to Mr. Biden on most policy matters.

The survey suggests that the newest member of the Democratic field, former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, may have at least a narrow opening with voters on economic issues. About 6 percent of Democrats said they trusted Mr. Bloomberg most on the economy, putting him outside the four-person top tier (Mr. Biden, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of South Bend, Ind.) but ahead of the rest of the field. Mr. Bloomberg drew less support on his handling of health care and international affairs, however. The other late entrant to the race, former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts, was well outside the top tier of candidates on all three issues. The findings on that question came after Mr. Patrick entered the race and after Mr. Bloomberg filed paperwork for a presidential bid; he formally announced his candidacy later in the month.

Apart from taxes, health care policy has been perhaps the most significant point of disagreement among the Democratic candidates. Among the top tier of candidates, Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren have emphasized their support for a government-run insurance system that they call Medicare for all, while Mr. Biden and Mr. Buttigieg have argued for less significant changes to the existing system. Compared with the wealth tax, Medicare for all is a much more partisan issue. Republicans strongly oppose the idea; Democrats even more strongly support it. (Independents support it, too, but by a narrower margin.) And Medicare for all doesn't divide Democrats the way the wealth tax does. Democrats of all ages, races and education and levels support the policy by similar margins. About the survey: The data in this article came from an online survey of 2,672 adults conducted by the polling firm SurveyMonkey from Nov. 4 to Nov. 11. A supplemental survey of 2,489 adults was conducted from Nov. 14 to Nov. 17 to collect more data on opinions of the Democratic candidates; that survey did not ask about taxes or health care policy. In both cases, SurveyMonkey selected respondents at random from the nearly three million people who take surveys on its platform each day. Responses were weighted to match the demographic profile of the population of the United States. The primary survey has a modeled error estimate (similar to a margin of error in a standard telephone poll) of plus or minus three percentage points, so differences of less than that amount are statistically insignificant.","Most college-educated Republican men oppose the plan, which otherwise finds wide backing. On Medicare for all, divisions are more starkly partisan.",d39fd801-ebaf-530d-8cf0-44a4115b968e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/29/business/29survey/29survey-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=4e45aeacc2833d291c887eff6b1d5047d0fc1d46e28f1e15cb136c970fc77945&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Senator Elizabeth Warren's wealth-tax proposal has been a focus of economic debate.,d39fd801-ebaf-530d-8cf0-44a4115b968e,N24News/imgs/d39fd801-ebaf-530d-8cf0-44a4115b968e.jpg,8

Lessons From a Year Among the Oldest Old 

By John Leland 

243 pp. Sarah Crichton Books/Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $26. ""Is there a benefit to getting old?"" asks the interviewer. John Sorensen looks away from the camera. The pause gives viewers a moment to observe him: a 91-year-old man in a soft gingham shirt, slightly stooped, his face etched with age. ""If you're going to be housebound like I am, I'd say no, it's not worth it,"" he replies quietly. ""What's left is not worth it."" That scene comes from a black-and-white video companion to ""85 & Up"": a series that ran in The New York Times's Metropolitan section during the latter half of 2015. The interviewer was the journalist John Leland. He chose an opportune moment to explore the frontier of old age. In New York, the ranks of Americans 85 and older swelled nearly 30 percent between 2000 and 2015. Nationally, the rate of growth was lower, but still remarkable. With that in mind, Leland embraced a mission: to follow six elders, reflecting a range of backgrounds and economic circumstances, in what he called ""a New York soap opera, unscripted.""

The author has a flair for showmanship, treating this ""prescription"" like a powerful elixir that he has tested, with salubrious results, on his own life. He laments not finding it sooner, urges readers to take a taste. ""Contentment had been there for the grasping, if only I had recognized it,"" he writes. ""Probably it's there for you."" Unfortunately, the ""lessons"" on offer aren't as compelling as the raw experiences from which they're derived. They are a slurry of positive-psychology platitudes, with occasional dashes of Buddhism and even EST. Live in the present. Focus on the good things. Find your purpose. Love unconditionally. Accept adversity. Feel gratitude. Acknowledge that ""problems were only problems if you thought about them that way. Otherwise they were life -- and yours for the living."" The book even goes so far as to suggest a positive side to cognitive decline: ""learning how to use memory loss as an advantage,"" a tool for wiping away bad experiences to attain greater happiness. Many of these conclusions come early in the book. As a result, when Leland sets off on his journey to find meaning from the elders' lives, there are few surprises. The stories feel like beams supporting a house to which he's already revealed the blueprint. I found myself wondering how the elders felt about having their experiences strip-mined for lessons. The author explains how ""Fred's found fulfillment in the present, because the future might not come,"" while ""Ping kept her spirits up by accepting her pains as a part of life."" When, late in the book, he shrugs off a woman's suggestion that ""I was reading too much into things,"" it's hard not to laugh. She's got his number -- he is old-splaining. As it turns out, you don't need sugar to make lemonade. Remember Sorensen, who spoke so candidly about wanting to die? Even he becomes a case study in gladness. ""The lesson of John Sorensen was that to accept death was to accept life, and to accept life was to live in joy, however dire the circumstances around you,"" the book explains. But actions speak louder than anything and, in that sense, Sorensen got the final word when he died last year. Fittingly, Leland wrote about it. The headline read: ""Somewhere John Sorensen Is Smiling.""","John Leland's book ""Happiness Is a Choice You Make"" chronicles the unlikely virtues of aging.",2a91ca54-4748-5193-8861-472cc38f0eac,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/06/nyregion/06jpOLD7/06jpOLD7-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=aaea8e6caaed9fdf00dc03902508547cb962ce73a3b2b975be550d6f5fbae321&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"John Sorensen, 91, at his home in Manhattan in 2015.",2a91ca54-4748-5193-8861-472cc38f0eac,N24News/imgs/2a91ca54-4748-5193-8861-472cc38f0eac.jpg,13

EROTIC JOURNEYS: EM(M)ANUELLE & JUST JAECKIN at the Quad Cinema (Jan. 25-Feb. 7). After hosting a series of (mostly) serious-minded X-rated films that expanded the mainstream, the Quad turns to soft-core qua soft-core with the hit 1970s skin flick ""Emmanuelle"" (starting on Friday) and the movies it spawned. In the original, the title character, played by the Dutch actress Sylvia Kristel, is guided by both men and women toward sexual fulfillment in Thailand, in ways that, to put it mildly, do not pass contemporary standards for gender or cultural sensitivity, or consent. Sequels and knockoffs (some of which omit an ""m"" in the heroine's name) follow on the docket, along with other films by the first movie's director, whose authorial signature -- ""un film de Just Jaeckin"" -- has to rank among the most guffaw-worthy credits in screen history.

[Read about the events that our other critics have chosen for the week ahead.] HOU HSIAO-HSIEN IN THE 21ST CENTURY at the Metrograph (Jan. 25-Feb. 3). Before the 21st century, American champions of this Taiwanese director spent years bemoaning that his films went unreleased in the United States. That streak ended when ""Millennium Mambo"" (on Friday and Saturday) -- a visually rhapsodic, sidelong look at youth and anomie -- sneaked into theaters at the end of 2003, two years after its Cannes premiere. The subsequent ""Three Times"" (on Saturday and Sunday) -- which proceeds in three chronologically disordered segments (1966, 1911, 2005) in styles suited to each era -- is an ideal introduction to Hou's work. And his Yasujiro Ozu homage ""Cafe Lumiere"" (on Feb. 3 and 4) is one of the greatest films about the paradoxical isolation of city life.

Sports,Virtual Cycling and Real Cheating: Cracking Down on 'Digital Doping',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/sports/cycling/zwift-cycling-digital-doping.html,"The cat-and-mouse battle between athletes who cheat and those who try to find them has gone digital. With a proliferation of online endurance events during the pandemic, catching cheats is the challenge faced by companies like Zwift, which produces an app that allows amateur and professional cyclists and runners to compete against one another from home. Now, the company is trying to crack down on so-called digital doping, or the practice of manipulating race data to either improve digital performances or cover up human or technical errors. ""There's so much cheating in Zwift that I think a lot of people would like to see more accountability,"" said Ray Maker, who writes the endurance sports technology blog DC Rainmaker. Yet professional athletes publicly accused of gaming the system by Zwift said that they did not intentionally cheat and that they had been made scapegoats as the company tries to show it is taking the matter seriously.

The pressure has been on to get the process right, especially leading up to a new event, the U.C.I. Cycling Esports World Championships, which the Union Cycliste Internationale, the global cycling governing body, is hosting on Wednesday. It will be a race of 50 kilometers (about 31 miles) on Zwift's virtual island Watopia, with each of the more than 130 entrants from 22 countries represented by an avatar. Male and female winners will be awarded 8,000 euros, or about $9,700, and a rainbow-striped champion jersey (both digitally and physically). The second- and third-place finishers will receive 4,000 and 2,000 euros. Instead of the race's taking place in an arena, as originally planned, riders will compete from their place of choice because of the pandemic. And so in addition to traditional antidoping controls to bar the use of performance-enhancing drugs, there will be data analysis to avoid digital doping, too. ""We feel confident in the ability to catch cheaters and to police the races,"" said Chris Snook, a spokesman for Zwift. To try to prevent the use of performance-enhancing drugs, the U.C.I. requested that athletes be part of an antidoping pool, which includes having proof of a biological passport (a record of biological markers following tests), providing their whereabouts for random testing in and out of competition, and complying with World Anti-Doping Agency policies.

A group called Zwift Accuracy and Data Analysis, made up of sports scientists and technical experts, will analyze riders' race data. It will look at the riders' race files registered on Zwift and on a second device, and inspect metrics from power meters and heart rate monitors to compare the athletes' digital race performance to their past data. Cyclists will race on bicycles mounted to turbo trainers, which are static devices used for riding bicycles indoors. Participants will all use the same model of turbo trainer as it requires no calibration -- removing one potential route to cheating -- and allows more standardized readings. The data that determine race rankings are captured from the turbo trainer and include power, power per kilogram of the rider, cadence and speed. Within 24 hours of the start of the event, participants will also have to submit their height and weight through a recorded video process, providing additional data that will influence the rider's power per weight numbers and final rankings.

When the race is over, athletes need to manually upload the second race file that they record on a second device connected to a power meter (usually a pedal or another device in their crank arms or chain rings). This second file is crucial for double-checking the validity of the first file registered on Zwift. There have been several accusations of digital doping since 2019, when British Cycling stripped Cam Jeffers of his Cycling eRacing Championship title; he was barred from all races, real and virtual, for six months. In November, news broke that two racers had been barred for six months from Zwift races for ""fabrication or modification of any data"" and ""bringing the sport into disrepute,"" according to a sentencing decision by Zwift.

The athletes -- Lizi Duncombe of Britain and Shanni Berger of Israel -- were accused of providing manipulated files. Duncombe has denied cheating; instead, she wrote on Facebook, her bike computer ran out of battery during the race, which meant she could not find a complete race file to upload. ""I had a file that looked like the warm-up, and it was the only thing I could find, so I sent it,'' she wrote. A friend offered to help her find a full file, she wrote, but Zwift disqualified her after recognizing that the first file was a warm-up file. The second file she uploaded ultimately seemed to be an incorrect file, too -- at which point, she wrote, she was accused of tampering. In Berger's case, the initial problem was that she had linked the wrong device (her power meter, rather than her trainer) to her online race, Zwift wrote. This disqualified her. Berger's team provided Zwift with additional data from the race to prove Berger's results, but those files had been manipulated, Zwift concluded. Berger said that she was still confused about the incident and that she did not intentionally commit any wrongdoing. ""I was positive that I connected my trainer,"" she said. ""I don't see any reason for me to connect my power meter. It doesn't make any sense. I even did a test before and sent everything to the director."" As for the accusation that files were manipulated, she said she did not know: ""I think now everything is possible, but I don't want to blame anyone, and it's not my place to say."" Berger, 19, said she received numerous hate messages after being barred; she said she has suffered from anxiety and thoughts of self-harm. ""Ms. Berger strongly and utterly denies all of Zwift's accusations against her, and is examining the possibility of taking legal action against Zwift,"" her lawyer, Iro Monitz, wrote in an email. Zwift has stood by its decisions. But the discussion in the cycling community over their cases and how to make the competitions fair and clear of manipulation has continued. Maker, who writes the endurance sports technology blog, said: ""There is zero reason technically that anybody, whether pro or amateur athletes, should have to have a secondary device on their handlebars recording data for backup. That should be handled in-game.""","A highly anticipated race on Wednesday, sponsored by the Zwift cycling app and the sport's world governing body, will test new controls on cheating in virtual competitions.",f7b0e662-133e-54c1-9113-15770a1047c4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/sports/09edoping-cycling/09edoping-cycling-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,A cyclist using a smart trainer connected to the cycling app Zwift.,f7b0e662-133e-54c1-9113-15770a1047c4,N24News/imgs/f7b0e662-133e-54c1-9113-15770a1047c4.jpg,9
Style,Why Protest Tactics Spread Like Memes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/31/style/viral-protest-videos.html,"Images of protest spread on social media reveal many other matching moments from opposite sides of the world, and they often feature everyday objects wielded ingeniously. Leaf blowers are used to diffuse clouds of tear gas; hockey sticks and tennis rackets are brandished to bat canisters back toward authorities; high-power laser pointers are used to thwart surveillance cameras; and plywood, boogie boards, umbrellas and more have served as shields to protect protesters from projectiles and create barricades. An Xiao Mina, an author, internet researcher and alumnus of the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, has studied these echoes. In the summer of 2014, when the Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong and the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States that followed the police killing of Michael Brown were taking place, she noted that the protesters spoke a common language, even sharing the same hand gesture characterized by the chant ""Hands up, don't shoot."" Occasionally, there was even direct acknowledgment between the disparate groups, ""as when Ferguson protesters donned umbrellas against the rain and cheekily thanked protesters in Hong Kong for the idea,"" Ms. Mina wrote in her 2019 book, ""Memes to Movements.""

But often, she noted, the images' similarity was unwitting. In their spread, their simultaneity and their indirect influence on each other, the protest videos had all the characteristics of memes, those units of culture and behavior that spread rapidly online. The same cultural transfer that gives us uncanny cake-slicing memes and viral challenges also advances the language of protest. ""We live in this world of attention dynamics so it makes sense that tactics start to converge,"" Ms. Mina said. She called the images' tendency to build on each other ""memetic piggybacking,"" and noted that everyday items that are subverted into objects of protest are ""inherently charismatic.""

Franklin Lopez, a founder and former member of Sub.media, an anarchist video collective that has filmed dozens of protests, said that ""videos shared through social media and mainstream media reports become rough 'how-to guides' on protest tactics."" ""You see peeps in Hong Kong using umbrellas as countersurveillance tools and folks over here will say, 'hey, brilliant idea!' and you'll see umbrellas at the next militant protests,"" he said. Of course, it's not just social media mimicry. Ms. Mina pointed out that ""activists from around the world do actively learn from each other and exchange tactical tips.""

On the topic of direct communication between groups in Hong Kong and the United States, Mr. Lopez said: ""Texts outlining not only tactics and strategies but reports of what worked and what didn't are shared and translated, but also talked about in in-person events, film screenings and internet talks."" In June, for example, Lausan, a group that formed during the Hong Kong protests that seeks to connect leftist movements in various countries, was a host of a webinar. It provided a forum for Hong Kong and American activists to share strategies. Katharin Tai, a doctoral candidate in political science at M.I.T. who studies Chinese foreign policy and the intersection of international politics and the internet, separated information sharing between Hong Kong and the United States into two categories. One was group-to-group sharing of tactics between the sets of protesters, though she noted that because both protest efforts were non-hierarchical, they were not necessarily organized from above. The second, she said, included the translation of helpful graphics and information -- say, which sort of gas masks best protect against tear gas -- that are then posted online. ""That's the less organized way, where they're just kind of pushing it out into the ether,"" she said.

The social internet has sped up a long history of direct and indirect dialogue between protest movements around the world. Mark Bray, an organizer of Occupy Wall Street and a lecturer at Rutgers University, said that sharing or imitating protest strategies and tactics is ""as old as protest strategies and tactics are,"" but that social media ""has exposed people to more different tactics."" ""In that sense, like all kinds of new communications technologies, it has shortened the perceived distance between movements around the world,"" said Mr. Bray, who is the author of ""Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,"" a history of that movement.

But Hong Kong does play a central role in the activist imagination, scholars and activists said, thanks both to the tactical ingenuity of protesters there, as well as Western media's willingness to cover pro-democracy demonstrations extensively. Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University who studies digital activism, noted that even nonpolitical publications were moved to cover the Hong Kong protests. ""Because Hong Kong is seen as a Western-style democracy that's being eaten up by its authoritarian parent, there's no controversy in reporting on it,"" she said. Asked whether Hong Kong loomed particularly large in the eyes of experienced protesters, Mr. Lopez answered emphatically: ""Hell yeah!"" He called the protests in Hong Kong ""epic."" ""More than anything the discipline, organization and persistence of these folks has been awe inspiring,"" Mr. Lopez said, adding that the people of Hong Kong ""are showing us what is possible.""","When items like umbrellas and leaf blowers are subverted into objects of resistance, they become very shareable.",f061f654-0d33-54d0-a1ba-2b328dfa56a4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/31/fashion/31viralprotests-promo/31viralprotests-promo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c667fdbb119625547d58fc2103091b4a07ec0467584f10635441fe9dc94c899e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Hong Kong, August 2019, and on right, Washington, D.C., May 2020.",f061f654-0d33-54d0-a1ba-2b328dfa56a4,N24News/imgs/f061f654-0d33-54d0-a1ba-2b328dfa56a4.jpg,15
Theater,Theater's Latest Prompt: Don't Act Your Age!,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/theater/usual-girls-dance-nation-adults-playing-kids.html,"The overalls. The pigtails. The eyebrow-penciled spray of freckles on the cheeks. Anyone with even a passing familiarity to children's theater knows (and probably dreads) the telltale signs of grown-ups playing kids on stage. Lisps are not uncommon. But several recent plays, including Clare Barron's acclaimed ""Dance Nation"" and the current Roundabout Underground offering ""Usual Girls,"" by Ming Peiffer, have ditched the usual cloying tropes. Ms. Barron's stage directions even say, ""Cuteness is death."" In an era when audiences and actors alike expect to see traditionally underrepresented demographics portrayed by actors from those communities, age has become a more fluid concept to explore. (This also allows for provocative content that would be questionable at best with actual children involved.) Not the mild suspension of disbelief wherein 23-year-olds play high school sophomores on TV -- some things will never change -- but a more drastic shift appears to be underway onstage. The most visible current example of this can be found at the Shubert Theater, where three pivotal roles in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" -- Dill, Jem and the play's narrator, Scout -- are being played by performers double and triple the characters' ages.

Aaron Sorkin, who has adapted Harper Lee's beloved 1960 novel for the stage, has described his version as a memory play, a quality that it shares with ""Dance Nation"" and ""Usual Girls."". This creates a plausible framework for older actors to portray a variety of ages, as they do in works like ""The Glass Menagerie"" and ""Dancing at Lughnasa"" -- but it also requires audiences to accept the unexpected. One ""Dance Nation"" performer, Ellen Maddow, turned 70 during the run of the play, in which she played a 13-year-old. What's the secret to success? Here are some thoughts, warnings and tips from the performers themselves, the playwrights who give them language, the directors who steer them and (a crucially important component) the costume designers who dress them. Some answers have been edited for space and clarity. (The ""Mockingbird"" cast and creative team declined to be interviewed.)

ELLEN MADDOW (""Dance Nation"") I happen to be naturally awkward, so some of it came easily to me! ... One danger were those cutesy vocal cadences. We would often say to each other, ""You're drifting,"" any time those would creep in. JAYNE HOUDYSHELL (who played the 9-year-old title character in ""Coraline"") I did spend time watching children in order to specifically observe how they lived in their bodies. They don't worry about how their clothes look, or whether their stomach is sucked in, or whether their hair is messed up. There is an ultimate freedom from all of that self-centered worry about how they appear to others that is marvelous.

EBONI BOOTH (""Dance Nation"") Clare was trying to make a point about how we're a lot of different ages at different times. She and Lee [the director Lee Sunday Evans] kept using the word ""grounded"" to describe how we use our adult experiences to convey youth. From the audience's perspective, watching a child approximate a situation -- especially a potentially inappropriate one -- is very different from watching an adult with hindsight navigate that same terrain. ANDREW KEENAN-BOLGER (""Newsies,"" ""Tuck Everlasting"") When I was 15, I was performing in the out-of-town tryout of ""Seussical"" when my voice changed. Most teenage boys have a hard enough time grappling with voice cracks, but I had to do it every night in front of 2,000 people. Theater was something that had been a hobby and a joy but was now keeping me up at night and making me resent my changing body. You just don't have those problems when you've cast an adult as a kid -- which I think is better for audiences and, frankly, a little healthier for kids who shouldn't feel worried that growing up will be bad for their career. MIDORI FRANCIS (""Usual Girls"") It requires you to be very, very open to the world, to everything you see and hear, and that's really cool. Some days, if I'm feeling particularly old or cynical, I'll watch a YouTube video of a little kid. And my scene partner and I play tag in the lobby every night before we go on.

CLARE BARRON (""Dance Nation"") The play is about how what happens to us at 13 stays with us for the rest of our lives. I sort of think of my early adolescence as the crucible of my identity -- the moment where I named myself as weird or sensitive or good at this and bad at that, and those names stuck. I wanted the 13-year-old characters to be haunted by the adults they would become. And the older actors to be haunted by their 13-year-old shadow selves. The biggest compliment I've ever received about the play came from a 13-year-old audience member who said that the play was everything she felt, but didn't know how to say yet. The older actors know how to say it.

LEIGH SILVERMAN (""Coraline"") There's rarely a dramatic need for cuteness in the theater. LEE SUNDAY EVANS (""Dance Nation"") I felt that we gained clarity and complexity. The complexity came from how the tension between these younger roles being inhabited by these adult actors asked all of us to endow these preteen characters with a lot of intelligence, maturity, emotional depth and wisdom that I think our culture often minimizes in the portrayal of young people. JAMES LAPINE (who cast Celia Keenan-Bolger, the current Scout in ""To Kill a Mockingbird,"" in ""The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee"") I made all the actors bring photographs in from when they were kids, and I'd ask them a lot of questions about what they were like at that age.

Fashion & Style,A Word From Your Officiant (for Better or Worse),https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/13/fashion/weddings/a-word-from-your-officiant-for-better-or-worse.html,"Jonathan Elliott officiated at several weddings as a Universal Life minister, but stopped marrying couples after he started working for the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey. Jonathan Elliott had zero experience and credentials obtained in three minutes online when he performed his first wedding in 2011 in Princeton, N.J. But he didn't make rookie mistakes, like asking guests to be seated halfway through the ceremony, or as was the case with one bumbling officiant, fumbling the pass off of the rings and dropping them into a lake. Instead, he was so magnetic a speaker and so conscientious a master of ceremonies for Sarah Gosnell and Jed Peterson, the couple he married, that several other friends asked him to lead their wedding ceremonies. By November 2016, he had put his online certification to use 20 times. Then he started a job as communications director for the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey, and his days of marrying friends were over. ""I was so impressed by the depth and intensity of thought put into every ceremony by clergy that I decided to stop marrying people out of respect, even though I loved doing it,"" said Mr. Elliott, who is from Hamilton, N.J. The training his Episcopalian colleagues brought to weddings, he said, made the power given him by the Universal Life Church, the most popular site for becoming a minister online, feel misplaced. ""It seemed like an encouraged abuse of power,"" he said.

Mr. Elliott's opinions are not widely shared. In fact, according to the wedding industry data tracking company the Wedding Report, 25.7 percent of couples were married by a friend or family member in 2017, up from 16.4 percent in 2010. And according to Dusty Hoesly, a doctoral candidate in religious studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara who wrote his dissertation on the Universal Life Church's role in contemporary weddings, the trend is likely to continue apace. Why? Because ""the ULC and its ministers are at the forefront of religious freedom, marriage equality and nuptial creativity,"" Mr. Hoesly said. As people under 30, the demographic most apt to marry, become increasingly nonreligious, their weddings will follow suit, he said, adding that there are now 23 million ULC ministers.

Ms. Cannon, the senior minister at SOUL Community Church in Columbia, Md., co-founded the International Association of Professional Wedding Officiants in 2015 to unite her colleagues and educate the public about the risks of enlisting amateur officiants. A handful of states do not recognize marriages performed by Universal Life ministers, including several counties in New York, and some divorces have been complicated by questions over their validity, said the Rev. Cannon, the senior minister at Soul Community Church, a Universalist congregation in Columbia, Md. More frequently, novice officiants bungle the paperwork needed to solemnize a union. ""You want your wedding to be legal,"" she said. ""Otherwise, it's just an expensive party. Just because your family member can use a camera doesn't mean you'd hire him to be your photographer. People in our organization understand marriage laws.""

A celebrant performs alternative ceremonies, including same-sex and nonreligious weddings. Ms. Blum became one in 2009, eight months after enrolling in an online course at the Celebrant Foundation and Institute. ""The reason I chose the institute instead of getting ordained online was I wanted strong knowledge of how to perform ceremonies,"" Ms. Blum said. ""I've had people come to me and say, 'I'd really like you to officiate, but if you can't do it I'm just going to get my florist to do it.' You have to spend a lot of time getting to know a couple if you want to make it special. People don't understand how much work goes into it.""

The Justice of the Peace Ms. Antonecchia, the owner of the wedding planning service Creative Concepts by Lisa, became a Connecticut justice of the peace in case of emergencies -- the kind she said she is seeing more of as couples increasingly rely on one-off officiants. In 2013, a wedding she planned on the Connecticut shoreline was nearly derailed by a newly minted officiant stuck in traffic. ""He finally made it, but from that point on, I knew I wanted to be able to offer the service myself,"" she said. Which is why she recommends professionals. ""We make sure everything is buttoned up and done. Your Uncle George may be a great guy. But what if his flight gets delayed and he misses the wedding?"" Ms. Ballard specializes in weddings that have at least one Jewish partner. ""Couples who use friends and family members to marry them often want to dip into the religious aspect very lightly with one or two rituals, like the breaking of the glass,"" she said. ""But that's not what makes a Jewish wedding a Jewish wedding."" In addition to upholding religious standards, ""I'm going to see that the day is seamless and easy for the bride and groom. If your sister is marrying you, she's so nervous about her performance she's only thinking about herself. It's not going to be a well-facilitated and organized experience.""

Mr. Bloom became a ULC minister in 2013 to orchestrate a wedding for a fan of his standup comedy routine. Now marrying strangers, which he does about 150 times a year, is his primary source of income. Friends and families generally don't charge for their services, but he said his typical fee of $600 -- steeper than the $214 the Wedding Report tallied as the average officiant expenditure in 2017 -- is money well spent. ""I think most people think of the ceremony as something they have to get through to get to the party,"" he said. ""I thought that way myself before I started doing weddings."" Now he knows better. ""If a kid starts losing it during the procession, I know how to deal with it. If the best man forgets the ring, I'll lighten the mood with a joke. I can make the ceremony the highlight of your wedding. That's probably what you want on the most important day of your life.""

Mr. Berk, the interior design guru from Netflix's ""Queer Eye,"" married three couples in June at the New York City Pride Parade. He was ordained a ULC minister for the event and has since been flooded with pleas, via social media, to do more. ""I've already got a couple thousand requests just on Twitter,"" he said. If he could marry every couple who asked, he would. ""I never thought I'd be crying on a parade float, but there I was. It was such an honor."" Mr. Berk knows firsthand that the chances of uncrossed t's and undotted i's increase when a professional is not presiding. A friend who officiated his own wedding, in 2012, forgot to file documents to legalize the union. ""He never sent in the correct paperwork,"" he said. ""We found out at the end of the year when we were like, 'Why did we never receive our marriage certificate?'"" Mr. Berk and his husband were remarried at the New York City Courthouse at the end of the year so they could file their taxes jointly. But he didn't mind. ""You used to have to get married in a courthouse or a church. Now it's more personal. It's way more special,"" he said.","About a quarter of all couples were married by a family member or friend last year, and the trend is likely to continue apace.",ab720cf3-eabf-5aee-83c8-1047c95a1978,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/01/fashion/weddings/00officiants11/00officiants11-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=89c0a0969642b4eb0dcdf507b0b183c6bbe7dd60d1f7791ff892be3771d9c7fa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Rev.

Dance,Dancer Tries to Quell 'West Side Story' Controversy: 'I Am Not a Victim',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/arts/dance/amar-ramasar-west-side-story.html,"In the weeks leading up to the opening of the Broadway revival of ""West Side Story,"" a small contingent of protesters and an online petition have called for the removal of a prominent cast member, Amar Ramasar, who was at one point fired from New York City Ballet after he shared sexually explicit photos of another dancer. On Friday, the woman depicted in those photos, who is Mr. Ramasar's girlfriend, spoke out. And she made clear that she thought Mr. Ramasar was being unfairly targeted. ""I am not a victim in this,"" the dancer, Alexa Maxwell, said in a news release. She explained that Mr. Ramasar had expressed his regret over the situation and that she had forgiven him. Ms. Maxwell, 25, has previously tried to keep her name out of the public discussion, but said that the recent protests -- one of them held Friday night outside the theater where ""West Side Story"" is now in previews -- prompted her to release the statement.

The objections have put a cloud over the production, and over Mr. Ramasar, 38, who has regained his job at City Ballet and resumed his acting career. In ""West Side Story"" he plays Bernardo, the leader of the Sharks, a neighborhood gang. The allegations against him surfaced in 2018 when Alexandra Waterbury, a former student of the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with City Ballet, sued the ballet and several men, including Chase Finlay, a dancer who had been her boyfriend, as well as Mr. Ramasar. In the lawsuit, Ms. Waterbury accused Mr. Finlay of sharing explicit photographs of her with Mr. Ramasar and others, without Ms. Waterbury's consent. Mr. Ramasar was accused of sending Mr. Finlay photos of a different dancer, who was not named in the lawsuit but who Ms. Maxwell now says was she. Mr. Finlay resigned from the ballet; Mr. Ramasar and another dancer were fired, but an arbitrator later ruled that their dismissals were too harsh a punishment. In an interview on Friday, Ms. Maxwell said she was exasperated by comments online calling Mr. Ramasar a ""rapist"" and by private messages chiding her for staying in the relationship despite his behavior. Ms. Maxwell said that while she considered Mr. Ramasar's decision to share her photos a ""misstep in judgment,"" she had forgiven him. She said she had told the arbitrator the same.

The couple have been together for nearly five years, she said. ""He apologized time and time again, and I think that it's my choice as a woman to forgive him,"" she said. During an hourlong phone conversation with Ms. Waterbury after her lawsuit was filed in 2018, Ms. Maxwell said, Ms. Waterbury tried to persuade her to join the lawsuit by saying that City Ballet ""is worth half a billion dollars,"" and that she would win ""a lot"" and could have ""an entirely new life."" Ms. Waterbury's lawyer, Jordan K. Merson, said in a statement that Ms. Maxwell's description of her conversation with Ms. Waterbury was inaccurate, but he did not go into specifics. Mr. Merson said that the timing of Ms. Maxwell's statement, more than a year after the lawsuit was filed, was ""suspect,"" but that it helped to demonstrate the ""problematic culture"" at City Ballet. ""It is unfortunate that Ms. Maxwell would try to taint Ms. Waterbury with all that she has done for the #MeToo movement,"" he said. Ms. Maxwell's public statement came as Mr. Ramasar and City Ballet have been seeking to dismiss Ms. Waterbury's lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan. The lawsuit accuses the ballet of condoning the dancers' bad behavior; the ballet has denied that, and noted that it took steps to discipline the dancers as soon as it learned of the allegations and investigated them. Ms. Waterbury's suit also accused Mr. Ramasar of encouraging Mr. Finlay to send him the explicit photos of her; in court papers, Mr. Ramasar's attorney noted that Mr. Finlay had already shared explicit images of Ms. Waterbury with others several times before his text exchange with Mr. Ramasar. Ms. Waterbury, 22, joined about two dozen protesters at the demonstration outside the Broadway Theater on Friday night. As ticketholders filed into the building, the demonstrators quietly held signs with statements including ""boo Bernardo"" and ""sexual harassment shouldn't get a standing ovation.""","Protesters have sought to remove Amar Ramasar from the musical over a photo-sharing scandal, but his girlfriend said she had forgiven him for sending explicit pictures of her.",98ec37b6-ae97-5e9d-bdf2-4c9870d186db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/31/arts/31westside-1/31westside-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f9e1c2f2523d2e1ea431a98e5ad0c564f9c6f055fc99104b9c857fcb51a29a67&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alexa Maxwell performing with New York City Ballet in 2015.

Television,"In Shows Like 'Social Distance,' TV Learns to Work From Home",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/arts/television/social-distance-connecting.html,"New series made in and about the pandemic are fascinating first drafts of pop history -- even if they're mixed as entertainment.

When the pandemic hit, the main problem for television productions was how you could possibly make shows in these times. The next and related problem was how you could possibly make shows about these times. Producers first tackled these related problems, technical and narrative, in special episodes like the ""Parks and Recreation"" and ""30 Rock"" reunions, as well as in one-off episodes of ongoing series, including the CBS legal drama ""All Rise,"" and in specials like HBO's awkward ""Coastal Elites."" The most notable thing about most of them is that they were done at all, but none of them had to sustain the approach for a full season. (An August Freeform four-episode series, ""Love in the Time of Corona,"" fell somewhere between the one-off special and the extended-series approach.) This month, two series test whether you can make compelling television in and about a deadly global crisis while it's still going on, and -- as viewers have been burrowing into the before-times normalcy of shows like ""The Office"" -- whether anyone wants to see that right now.

Both ""Connecting...,"" on NBC, and ""Social Distance,"" arriving Thursday on Netflix, are comedies. Maybe it makes sense: Just as ""M*A*S*H"" made dark comedy of the Korean War during the Vietnam War, the producers of these series must sense that asking people to escape a dire reality with more of that reality would be a tough sell without promising them at least theoretical laughs. Some are more theoretical than others. The well-meaning but bland ""Connecting ..."" doesn't feel like an organic, fleshed-out story so much as a pandemic season of an existing, generic friends-hanging-out sitcom whose previous seasons you haven't seen. The comedy, from the ""Blindspot"" creator Martin Gero and his frequent collaborator Brendan Gall, centers on a group of friends in Los Angeles, now reduced to video chatting in between waiting for deliveries and doomscrolling the news. Many of the major friend-comedy food groups are represented, with a pandemic spin on each situation and neurosis. The high-strung Pradeep (Parvesh Cheena) is being driven stir-crazy by his young kids. Garret and Michelle (Keith Powell and Jill Knox) guiltily find that their marriage is thriving as the world falls apart. And possibly-more-than-friends Annie (Otmara Marrero) and Ben (Preacher Lawson) find their will-they-won't-they flirtation stymied by the they-can't reality of quarantine. The sitcom unfolds chronologically from the start of shelter-in-place orders. One of its pleasures is the attention to the details of those early days; we've spent enough time coping that pandemic nostalgia is actually a real, if unsettling, thing. Remember thermometer shortages? Remember making your own hand sanitizer? Remember sourdough?

""Connecting ..."" intersperses its quar-hangout humor with heavier realities. Ellis (Shakina Nayfack) is transgender, has lost her job in the recession and worries about paying for hormone treatments. Jazmin (Cassie Beck), a doctor in New York, drops in to deliver the reality from the Covid front lines. It's earnest, reasonably ambitious and lightly funny. But ""Connecting ..."" lacks connection, its characters and dynamics too standard-issue to attach to. Too many of the quick-banter jokes feel as if they need a laugh track, and if you're talking about 2020 in 2020, the kind of laughs that feel most believable come with a catch in the throat.

That's the mode of the more-effective ""Social Distance,"" an eight-episode anthology comedy created by Hilary Weisman Graham of ""Orange Is the New Black"" (whose creator, Jenji Kohan, serves as a producer). As on ""Orange,"" the comedy of ""Social Distance"" is sharp, provocative and cathartic, and more often than not, it's rooted in pain. Though the episodes are short, some less than 20 minutes, watching them feels like entering the lives of full characters who have stories and conflicts that predate the pandemic and would be interesting even without it. The episodes are like tight one-act stage plays, ranging from sex farce (a slight installment about a stir-crazy couple looking for a Covid-safe threesome) to just this side of melodrama.

In the episode ""Delete All Future Events,"" Ike (Mike Colter) an alcoholic, has a few months of sobriety under his belt when the lockdown hits and his girlfriend leaves him. The isolation hits twice as hard for someone in recovery. ""Just focus on you,"" his Alcoholics Anonymous friend Gene (Steven Weber) urges him over FaceTime. ""If I focus on me any more, I'm going to get myself pregnant,"" Ike answers. Like other quarantine productions, ""Social Distancing"" has to accommodate the limitations of stitching together a lot of solo scenes. I found myself springing uneasily to attention when two actors shared physical space, a learned reflex from months of epidemiological stranger danger. Sometimes ""Social Distance"" relies on family ties to get actors safely in the same scene, like the real-life married couple Becky Ann and Dylan Baker, playing retirees discovering that their life goals have drifted apart. (""Connecting ..."" does likewise with the wife and husband Knox and Powell, who shot scenes in their home.) But ""Social Distance"" uses the limitations as a creative spur, grasping at all the platforms people use to connect virtually -- not just Zoom but also online video games, TikToks, Grindr -- and stitching them together into a new storytelling form. (""Connecting ..."" is less far-reaching in its use of formats, but it does manage to make an ersatz hangout of a virtual-reality poker room.) The narrative form says something about life in quarantine, but it also captures digital life in 2020 generally. The season is organized chronologically, and as it moves forward the stories become less exclusively about the pandemic, just as life itself did with time. The final episode, about Black video technicians setting up to shoot a virtual graduation for a largely white prep school, focuses on the racial-justice protests after the killing of George Floyd (which also comes up in ""Connecting...,"" more jarringly).

One of the stronger episodes, ""everything is v depressing rn,"" a sweet heart-wrencher about a teen gamer who is trying to give voice to a crush on a teammate, doesn't inherently need to be a quarantine story at all -- partly because it deals with a culture and a generation used to living in virtual space. I was reminded, watching this episode, of one of the only pandemic specials I've seen that legitimately shined as an episode of TV: May's quarantine episode of the Apple TV+ workplace-tech comedy ""Mythic Quest: Raven's Banquet."" (An animated episode of Pop's ""One Day at a Time"" also stood out, but it was written before the pandemic and worked in a reference to the virus only tangentially.) Touching and genuinely funny, the ""Mythic Quest"" episode used technology not as a stunt but as one of the ways its characters naturally communicate, taunting one another over group chats and dropping notes of concern into lines of code. The virtual interactions felt less like an emergency response than part of the show's existing language. ""Connecting ..."" premiered to weak ratings, though that may be less a reflection of its quality than of the homebound's interest in watching the homebound. It has become a cliche to say that TV has been an ""escape"" in the pandemic, but certainly one of its pleasures is that you can at least watch other people escape. Whether or not any of these shows becomes a hit or a lasting classic, they're pieces of history. If, God willing, the global emergency doesn't drag on for years, they could be among our only pop-culture records of how people lived in the pandemic, captured by the tools people used in the pandemic. They could even have a creative legacy. At their best, these shows have been more than curiosities and gimmicks. Like warmer-hearted versions of ""Black Mirror,"" pandemic productions are finding new tools to explore ways of living that had become more virtual and mediated long before any virus.",New series made in and about the pandemic are fascinating first drafts of pop history — even if they're mixed as entertainment.,419fe055-b251-5c8b-a069-8f5fe21f110a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/13/arts/13socialdistance-2/13socialdistance-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=13044b497bd0024687740a13982ec74f504a5f228c5443289a511f6a1475e200&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mike Colter in ""Social Distance"" on Netflix, the latest TV series to reflect the pandemic back at viewers.",419fe055-b251-5c8b-a069-8f5fe21f110a,N24News/imgs/419fe055-b251-5c8b-a069-8f5fe21f110a.jpg,3
Health,'Devious Defecator' Case Tests Genetics Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/02/health/devious-defecator-case-tests-genetics-law.html,"Dennis Reynolds, left, and Jack Lowe in Atlanta in May. The men sued their employer after they were asked to take a DNA test.

Seven years ago, Congress prohibited employers and insurers from discriminating against people with genes that increase their risks for costly diseases, but the case that experts believe is the first to go to trial under the law involves something completely different: an effort by an employer to detect employee wrongdoing with genetic sleuthing. Amy Totenberg, the federal district judge in Atlanta who is hearing the case, called it the mystery of the devious defecator. Frustrated supervisors at a warehouse outside Atlanta were trying to figure out who was leaving piles of feces around the facility. They pulled aside two laborers whom they suspected. The men, fearing for their jobs, agreed to have the inside of their mouths swabbed for a genetic analysis that would compare their DNA with that of the feces. Jack Lowe, a forklift operator, said word quickly spread and they became the objects of humiliating jokes. ""They were laughing at us,"" he said. The two men were cleared -- their DNA was not a match. They kept their jobs but sued the company. On May 5, Judge Totenberg ruled in favor of the laborers and set a jury trial for June 17 to decide on damages. She determined that even though the DNA test did not reveal any medical information, it nonetheless fell under the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, or GINA.

Atlas Logistics Group Retail Services,which operates the warehouse, has not decided whether to appeal, its lawyer, Dion Kohler, said. The company had contended that the test provided no medical information about the employees and that both kept their jobs and suffered no discrimination. The decision in this case means the scope of the law goes far beyond what Congress seems to have envisioned, legal experts said. Even if an employer, as in this case, did not seek an employee's DNA to look for medical conditions, it was getting a trove of data that it arguably should not have, said Jessica L. Roberts , director of the Health Law and Policy Institute at the University of Houston Law Center. The judge, she said, ruled that ""a genetic test is a genetic test is a genetic test."" ""It's really a bizarre case,"" said Lawrence O. Gostin, a law professor at Georgetown University. ""But beyond the comical, it touches on some quite serious issues."" ""Anyone in the future thinking about using a genetic test in ways that can embarrass or harm an individual will have to confront the fact that it violates federal law,"" he added. Benign intentions are not enough. The concern is that allowing an employer to obtain an employee's DNA would open a Pandora's box. ""While the employer here was taking the DNA for identification purposes, once it gained access it could have theoretically tested for all kinds of other things, including issues related to health, and used that information to discriminate,"" Ms. Roberts said.

The law was enacted in part to alleviate people's fears that their genetic information could be used against them. There were concerns that people who feared discrimination if they got a genetic test would refuse to participate in clinical trials needed for the advance of medical science, or avoid getting tests that might be useful for their health. There have been very few cases under the law, and legal experts said they did not know of any others that had gone to trial. The cases so far have mostly involved workers suing employers who had asked for their medical histories. A Connecticut woman claimed she was fired after she disclosed that she had a gene that predisposed her to breast cancer. Her claim was settled out of court with a nondisclosure agreement. Sharon Terry, chief executive of the Genetic Alliance, an advocacy group for people with genetic disorders that lobbied for the law, said she and other advocates were pleased by the outcome of the case in the Atlanta court, but surprised by both its substance and the dearth of other cases. ""Is the law so effective that employers are well-informed and not going there, or is this less of an issue than we thought it would be?"" Ms. Terry said, adding that she thought there was some truth in both. The case of the warehouse workers began more than two years ago when Atlas asked its loss prevention manager, Don Hill, to find out who was defecating in one of its warehouses where grocery store goods were stored. After looking at employee work schedules, Mr. Hill identified workers who he thought were present when the deeds were done. He asked a forensics lab to compare the DNA of men the company suspected with the DNA of the feces to see if there was a match. Everyone knew about the problem, Mr. Lowe said. The workers were abuzz, wondering what sort of person could be doing it. Then, one day after his break, Mr. Lowe was ushered into a room by his supervisor. His union steward, a human resources manager and Mr. Hill were waiting for him. ""They sat me down and asked me did I know why I was asked to come upstairs,"" Mr. Lowe said. ""They asked if I knew about the feces. I said I had heard about it and thought it was gross. They asked me to take a DNA test because they had reason to believe it was me.""

He agreed to take the test, saying he feared for his job, and a forensics expert from the testing lab swabbed the inside of his cheek. The lab results exonerated Mr. Lowe and another worker, Dennis Reynolds, who delivered food from the warehouse to grocery stores. But by then, Mr. Lowe had found a law firm, Barrett & Farahany, where three lawyers agreed to take the case. Mr. Reynolds joined Mr. Lowe in the lawsuit. The lawyers thought the men had a case because the genetics law had made it illegal ""for an employer to request, require, or purchase genetic information with respect to an employee."" The question before the judge was whether the DNA samples Atlas requested constituted genetic information, even though they did not reveal disease genes or risk factors for disease. Atlas's lawyer, Mr. Kohler, said the DNA results from the test the company sought were not genetic information, and involved normal minute variations in DNA sequences that did not reveal anything about disease genes. The intent of the law, he added, was to prevent discrimination based on a genetic propensity to disease, and there was none in this case. Both men kept their jobs. (Mr. Reynolds has since left Atlas, and now works as a used-car salesman. Atlas never figured out who was responsible.) But Judge Totenberg said the law defined genetic information as data arising from a genetic test. The DNA test used in this case, she ruled, qualified as a genetic test that revealed genetic information. In June, the case will go to trial to determine damages. Ms. Roberts said the judge and jury would have little precedent to go by. The genetics law is different from other antidiscrimination laws that say employers cannot hire, fire or fail to promote a worker based on such things as race, sex or a disability. GINA says an employer cannot even ask for or buy genetic information. ""We have a lot of existing case law on how judges should award remedies for employment discrimination,"" Ms. Roberts said. ""But what happens when an employer obtains genetic information and does not act on it? Judges currently have little guidance.""",A company's use of DNA tests to investigate employee wrongdoing ran afoul of a federal antidiscrimination law.,212a1181-4f90-5494-8c9c-4bec0eb38a1e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/30/science/02genetics1/02genetics1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=c963e4a5ff36477292ecfc9a55fb2f0cf1ee35c98c065576961759803048d185&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dennis Reynolds, left, and Jack Lowe  in Atlanta in May.

Economy,Workers Face Permanent Job Losses as the Virus Persists,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/03/business/economy/coronavirus-permanent-job-losses.html,"The United States economy is facing a tidal wave of long-term unemployment as millions of people who lost jobs early in the pandemic remain out of work six months later and job losses increasingly turn permanent. The Labor Department said on Friday that 2.4 million people had been out of work for 27 weeks or more, the threshold it uses to define long-term joblessness. An even bigger surge is on the way: Nearly five million people are approaching long-term joblessness over the next two months. The same report showed that even as temporary layoffs were on the decline, permanent job losses were rising sharply. Those two problems -- rising long-term unemployment and permanent job losses -- are separate but intertwined and, together, could foreshadow a period of prolonged economic damage and financial pain for American families. Companies that are limping along below capacity this far into the crisis may be increasingly unlikely to ever recall their employees. History also suggests the longer that people are out of work, the harder it is for them to get back into a job.

Altogether, nearly 3.8 million people had lost their jobs permanently in September, according to the Labor Department's latest monthly survey, almost twice as many as at the height of the pandemic job losses, in April. As a result, the employment rebound, which was initially rapid, may begin to feel more like the grinding healing process that dragged on for a full decade after the Great Recession, economists warned. ""The risk is that you end up with people permanently detached from the labor market, and either you never get them back in or it takes you 10 years to get them back in, like it did the last time,"" said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""The economic consequences are that you depress future growth."" The slow recovery from the Great Recession, when the tally of the long-term unemployed neared seven million, made it clear that extended spells out of work can haunt workers, locking them out of job opportunities or reducing pay. Whether that penalty holds true in the pandemic-induced downturn remains unclear, but the economic repercussions of having a large number of workers sidelined will undoubtedly weigh on the United States' economic potential and disrupt lives. Jerome H. Powell, the Federal Reserve chair, has warned that a ""significant group"" of people may ""still be struggling to find jobs"" even as the labor market strengthens.

The risk of permanent job loss weighs heavily on workers like MacKenzie Nicholson of Nottingham, N.H., who lost her job with the American Cancer Society in June after the pandemic cut into the organization's fund-raising. Her husband, a service manager at a Jeep dealership, kept his job after a brief furlough, but his income is not enough to cover their monthly expenses. Ms. Nicholson plans to start picking up gig shifts with DoorDash and Uber in the evenings, once her husband gets home from work and can take over watching their two young children.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""I'll be saying goodbye to my husband when he gets in the door,"" she said. ""It won't be ideal for our marriage."" It's hard for Ms. Nicholson, 30, to square the anxiety over meeting basic needs with the life she had one year ago, when she and her husband bought their first home, providing a sense of security. Now their mortgage payment feels like an albatross, and a simple trip to Target feels out of reach. ""My daughter ran out of toothpaste and I put it on the shopping list, and then realized we could use the sample bottles we get from the dentist to hold out for a few weeks,"" Ms. Nicholson said. ""I'm making disgusting casseroles with everything I have in the fridge so I don't have to go grocery shopping."" Lasting joblessness is a comparatively new problem in the United States. Europe, where social safety nets are more generous and labor rules are stricter, has long had high rates of extended unemployment. But economists once thought that the United States' less restrictive, more dynamic labor market made it relatively immune. Even in the brutal recessions of the early 1980s, when the unemployment rate topped 10 percent, less than a quarter of job seekers had remained out of work longer than six months.

This is a very different crisis, both in swiftness and in breadth. Workers in entire industries were furloughed practically overnight, with little regard for their unique skills and performance. Employers may not fault future applicants for those lost jobs. ""It's not clear to me that anyone's going to hold it against you that you were an unemployed waiter for nine months,"" said Jay Shambaugh, a George Washington University economist. But there is mounting evidence that the long-term jobless will face a harder road back to work. In August, newly unemployed workers -- out of work less than five weeks -- were twice as likely to find jobs as those out of work more than six months. Many people who aren't looking for work now because they believe they are on temporary layoff may find that their jobs never return. They may be ""frozen in place by the uncertainty of not knowing what the economy is going to look like,"" said Thomas Barkin, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. If losses do turn permanent, it's unclear how quickly workers will be able to shift into new roles. People with similar backgrounds tend to apply for similar jobs, which could lead to a glut of available workers in categories that lack the demand to absorb them.

Nathaniel Claridad is less certain what the future holds, though he, too, hopes for a return to normalcy. He was acting in a show in Florida when Broadway closed. Days later, the artistic director informed him and the rest of the cast and crew that they were free to go -- they were shutting down as well. Fast forward six months and Mr. Claridad, who had another show and a concert postponed and saw his job selling tickets at a Midtown theater wilt away, remains unemployed. He's current on rent for the Washington Heights apartment he shares with his employed partner, and he's hopeful that his shows will take place in 2021 -- but he's starting to pick up Zoom directing gigs here and there, and he is applying to teaching jobs. ""It's getting to the time now where I have to decide what to do, in terms of income,"" Mr. Claridad, 38, said. But there are downsides to looking for work when your colleagues with similar skill sets are doing the same. ""Talking with friends, it feels like the market is saturated with people like me who are looking for another source of income,"" he said.

Labor supply also remains an issue. Employers report that many workers, including those who are older, are nervous about returning given the health threat. People with children, particularly women, are struggling to return to jobs because they have limited child care options with schools and day cares all or partly closed. Women's participation rate -- the share working or looking for work -- dropped last month to its lowest level since 1987, excluding April and May this year. The household employment survey suggested that they might have lost more than 140,000 jobs in September, though a separate survey of businesses showed them still eking out gains. The people most at risk of getting stuck on the sidelines in this crisis are in many cases those least prepared to take the hit. Minority groups have seen bigger spikes in unemployment during the pandemic era -- and getting back to work is taking them longer, suggesting that they are likely to make up a disproportionate share of the long-term unemployed. Black joblessness jumped higher earlier in the recession and is declining more slowly than that for white workers: It stood at 12.1 percent in September, compared with 7 percent for white adults. Hispanic unemployment jumped at the onset of the crisis but is declining relatively quickly. Even so, it stood at 10.3 percent last month. Those groups hold far less wealth, so they are less financially prepared for a long period out of work. For now, unemployment is falling across demographic groups as layoffs end, and some economists are hopeful that the rebound will continue -- though most warn that recovery will remain incomplete until the virus is under control.","Soon, a wave of people will have been out of work for more than six months, the threshold for long-term unemployment.",90db141f-64d1-573d-878c-bc6b581820cf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/business/04DC-Scarring-jp-print1/00DC-Scarring-01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=1d208f7aff963b5f6ed1fee05752a58a02b530b81185e9e01d17e0ae90172211&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Millions of people who lost jobs in March and April, like Nathaniel Claridad, an actor in New York, are hitting the six-month mark that defines long-term joblessness in the United States.",90db141f-64d1-573d-878c-bc6b581820cf,N24News/imgs/90db141f-64d1-573d-878c-bc6b581820cf.jpg,8
Style,Felicity Jones on Becoming Ruth Bader Ginsburg,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/10/style/felicity-jones-ruth-bader-ginsburg.html,"When it comes to her career, the actress Felicity Jones is game for taking on a range of roles, including the fierce Jyn Erso in ""Rogue One: A Star Wars Story"" and Ruth Bader Ginsburg in ""On the Basis of Sex,"" the biopic on the Supreme Court justice that will be out on Dec. 24. In beauty matters, Ms. Jones, 35, is a bit less adventurous but still willing to switch up her regimen if it's good for her sensitive skin. Raised in England, in the Bournville village of Birmingham, she now lives in London, where you may find her at her favorite yoga studio. I get up and wash my face with water. Then I pull my hair back and run down to the gym. It's the best way for waking up and putting yourself in a good mood. When I come back, I exfoliate -- I do that once or twice a week. I use a product by Caudalie that has a very fine grit. It's not too abrasive. Or I use this cleanser by La Roche-Posay that's amazing for sensitive skin. A lot of products do irritate my skin, so when I find something that works, I'm fairly loyal.

Then I moisturize. My skin-care game is about hydration, hydration, hydration. When you do a lot of traveling, you have to put a lot of care into your skin. Occasionally I like to have a facial because it's incredibly relaxing, but I find it's the day-to-day care that's key, and that includes not too much caffeine, not too much alcohol, rest and water. I'm an ambassador for Cle de Peau, and I use La Creme. It has a really fine texture, which I love. I use the eye cream as well. Then I do SPF -- I have the one by La Roche-Posay. At night, I use the same products, but first I take off my makeup with Bioderma Sensibio micellar water. It's fantastic -- it doesn't dry you out. I really enjoy makeup. I always have. When I was younger, I used to take art classes, so when I approach makeup, I love the artistry, and I love the colors. It can change a face, honestly. For the Ruth Bader Ginsburg role, I had lots and lots of in-depth conversations on the details of Ruth's face, down to the shape of her teeth. I was obsessed. I had my teeth capped so the shape would be the same. Eyebrows are hugely powerful -- the way you shape them. I also contoured and wore blue-gray contact lenses. When I'm off, I do brown mascara -- I love one by Charlotte Tilbury -- and brown Cle de Peau eyeliner. I like brown during the day because I like the effect to be a little bit softer. If I'm going out at night, then I'll probably go for a black, something a bit more graphic.

I use a little blush. I like either a pinky blush with pink lips, or sometimes I go for an apricot blush for daytime. Those by Nars are great. Or I do Glossier Cloud Paint. And I do love the Cle de Peau concealer, which I use everywhere. I use it under my eyes and on my nose because it gets red out and covers my spots. If it's night and I need more coverage, I use the Foundatio n from Cle de Peau.

If I'm going to the set, I'm usually up so early, at 4 a.m., that fragrance doesn't enter into my head. But I do wear fragrance in my everyday life. I've been wearing Diptyque 34 Boulevard Saint Germain for the last few years. It's quite unisex, and it's not too sweet. I absolutely love wigs and hairpieces. Playing Ruth, her hair is pivotal. When she was younger, she followed the pressure of looking a certain way, from her clothes to her hair. But by the '70s, that dissipated, and she evolved to her one look: the low ponytail. She loved the scrunchie and the hair scarf. For her, it was about being practical and saving time in the morning. She has kept that style for 30 years. It's like Karl Lagerfeld or Anna Wintour. When you stick to one look, icon status is yours!

For myself, I tend to do a natural looking blow-dry. I like it with a little movement and not too done. My hair icons would be Kate Moss or Jane Birkin. Because I have naturally wavy hair, my main goal is to control the flyaways. I like the Davines Oi All in One Milk for that, and it keeps it glossy. I use a hair serum by Davines as well. With all the styling on set, my hair can get dry. A hairdresser once recommended the Leonor Greyl Masque Fleurs de Jasmin, and now I use it once a week. I love, love getting a deep tissue massage. I also have a fantastic physical therapist, David Higgins, who I worked with on my last job. I was doing a lot of running around and stunts. It's really important for actors to look after their bodies, and when working on films, you have to think like an athlete. If I'm in a hotel, I go to the gym and spend a long time on the step machine. It's about trying to target and tone. I also work with Amy Rosoff Davis -- she's fantastic. She just gets my body and how to make it work. And she has a background in dance and Pilates and yoga, and all the movements are about building your core. It's about making you strong and lean. I also love restorative yoga -- anything that calms the adrenal glands. I'm based in London, and I go to Triyoga. They have places all over the city. I eat very healthily when I can, but I'm not too hard on myself. For me, it's all about common sense, and I don't like extremities in diet. Sometimes you need to treat yourself. Otherwise you become very boring.","Find out the actress's beauty tips, and how she transformed into the Supreme Court justice for ""On the Basis of Sex.""",f871107d-315c-5d2e-b8cc-b0b4802d59aa,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/13/fashion/13SKIN-JONES-1/13SKIN-JONES-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=5bd5953212faa6fe7be99a16f8e78e3f66fe57ef097c14e7c2520e594c2ffbac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The actress Felicity Jones.,f871107d-315c-5d2e-b8cc-b0b4802d59aa,N24News/imgs/f871107d-315c-5d2e-b8cc-b0b4802d59aa.jpg,15
Style,When You're Ready to Move Beyond Irish Spring,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/28/style/when-youre-ready-to-move-beyond-irish-spring.html,"Some new grooming products -- among them, Bravo Sierra, Hawthorne and Huron -- are meeting men where they're at, including CrossFit and military bases.





When a new men's personal care company called Huron recently asked CrossFit Union Square in Manhattan to test its products, some of the men there didn't have much basis for comparison. A few told Matt Mullenax , the 33-year-old founder of Huron, that they had never used a face wash. Eric Brown, one of the gym's owners, said he doubted most could list five brands. And the products available in the gym's locker rooms are sufficiently unmemorable that Mr. Brown couldn't name them -- and he's the one who buys them. ""What guy is going to do research into the body wash?"" Mr. Brown said. ""There are so many guys -- and I'm one of them -- who are good about working out and eating healthy, but when it comes to our bathroom routine, it's kind of pathetic."" Huron is one of a handful of new companies hoping to change that -- and cash in -- by targeting men in untapped (at least for the beauty industry) places. For Huron, which began selling its products at the end of July, that's CrossFit gyms; for a start-up called Bravo Sierra, it's military bases. Neither is the sort of spot one associates with discovering a new moisturizer, but then again, many men don't have a place to do that.

While a tiny fraction of men hunt for face masks (a growing category) at specialty retailers, the rest still stick to the essentials, mostly from legacy brands like Irish Spring, introduced in 1970, and the 81 -year-old Old Spice. Besides function, men prioritize convenience, so the marketing tactics of newcomers like Huron and Bravo Sierra make sense, said Larissa Jensen, a beauty industry analyst at the research marketing company NPD. ""They're putting products in the hands of men where they are,"" Ms. Jensen said. In some ways, these companies are following in the footsteps of Hawthorne, a three-year-old ""grooming solutions"" company whose sales grew 1,000 percent in the last year, according to company figures. With a roughly 20-question online quiz (90 percent of customers take it on their phones), Hawthorne matches customers with products, solving what Brian Jeong, 30, a founder, calls ""an accessibility problem"" for men. Eighty percent of its customers are from outside New York and California. ""Guys don't go up to each other and say: 'Hey, your skin looks really soft. What are you using?'"" Mr. Jeong said. ""Guys don't see this kind of thing as a hobby, and they don't shop at Sephora.""

There's reason to listen to him: Hawthorne recently closed $8 million in funding. Investors include Imaginary, run by the Net-a-Porter founder Natalie Massenet, and Nick Brown, who at his previous firm invested early in companies like Goop. ""Guys want to be spoken to on their own terms and on their own turf,"" Mr. Jeong said. Those terms, for the record, are ""clueless"" -- a box the majority of customers check on Hawthorne's. ( Though often not without overestimating their knowledge first. A good number check ""expert"" and have to go back and downgrade themselves once they see the level of detail in subsequent questions, Mr. Jeong said. ) A recent Hawthorne marketing email explained how to use hair conditioner. Huron is keeping things similarly simple. The face wash instructs men to use a nickel-size amount because ""some guys have super-heavy hands,"" Mr. Mullenax said. ""We want to alleviate that sense of 'I don't really know what I'm doing.'"" Each of the company's three products -- the minimum Huron thinks any man needs -- costs less than $20. This is already a big jump for men who have only ever used Irish Spring bar soap as an all-in-one body wash, face wash and shampoo, Mr. Mullenax said. CrossFit gyms in several states are trying the line. Eventually it will be available for purchase alongside hand grips and Rx protein bars, yet another results-oriented product CrossFit's famously loyal fans snap up. (Peter Rahal, a founder of RxBars, is an adviser to Huron.) Or so Mr. Mullenax hopes. His theory is that men who care about performance when it comes to their bodies can be convinced they need something better than drugstore brands for their skin.

Mr. Mullenax knows this audience: He is a longtime CrossFitter who couldn't discern a real difference between the products at CVS, but on the premium end ""the native Ohioan in me couldn't stomach paying $65 for face wash,"" he said. One of Huron's other advisers is Jason Khalipa, a 2008 CrossFit Games champion who owns a string of boxes, as the gyms are called, in the San Francisco area. The products are also available online, where the brand's welcome screen reads: ""Look alive out there. It's time, man."" For its part, Bravo Sierra aims to take over the military's bathrooms and tactical backpacks -- and those of gym boot-camp-loving civilians -- by creating ""performance wellness"" products tested by men on active duty in the Persian Gulf, South Pacific, Southeast Asia and north Alaska. On Aug. 1, the company made its debut on bases worldwide; on Aug. 21 , products became available to civilians online. (Companies that want to sell their products on bases must get approval from the Defense Department.) Among the offerings, which cost from $7 to $14 (though cheaper for military): torture-tested biodegradable anti-bacterial wipes -- the company calls these ""tactical showers"" -- that remove dirt but aren't too astringent. (""Torture test"" is research-and-development slang for the most challenging condition a product will have to survive: in this case, clean between the toes without ripping.) There's also a shaving foam designed not to irritate skin even if men are shaving with cold water, as is sometimes the only option when deployed, along with a four-in-one clear ""post-foaming gel technology"" -- gel that turns to foam -- that can be used to shave as well as wash one's face, body and hair. There is minimal packaging because these guys don't have time to take a tube out of a box and flip caps. (The look of the packaging was designed by Patrick Li, the creative director of T: The New York Times Style Magazine.) ""They told us they needed something they could open with one hand,"" said Benjamin Bernet, 42, a founder of the company. Mr. Bernet is a personal care industry veteran; he was part of the Kiehl's team that put the brand in Equinox in 2009, long before every luxury gym had fancy bathroom products.",A handful of new skin care companies are targeting men on their own turf.,95b08f25-d263-533d-9740-9f18a3363820,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/27/fashion/27SKIN-combo/27SKIN-combo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=a9a096b54e55714ac1084d15801c0da8d3abc2571e36cad0b6f85ef09c472335&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Some new grooming products — among them, Bravo Sierra, Hawthorne and Huron — are meeting men where they're at, including CrossFit and military bases.",95b08f25-d263-533d-9740-9f18a3363820,N24News/imgs/95b08f25-d263-533d-9740-9f18a3363820.jpg,15
Media,"Tidal, Jay Z's Streaming Service, Sells a Stake to Sprint",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/23/business/media/tidal-streaming-music-jayz-sprint.html,"Don't count Jay Z out of the streaming wars quite yet.

Two years ago, the rap star and entrepreneur bought Tidal, a small streaming service, for $56 million, with lofty -- if vague -- plans to build an online music empire that would lure customers with exclusive content from fellow celebrities.

The news media pounced on early stumbles by the service, and with its losses mounting, Tidal was quickly put on death watch by the music industry. Almost since Jay Z took it over, the service has been the subject of speculation that it would fail or be subsumed by a deep-pocket competitor like Apple.

But Jay Z, whose real name is Shawn Carter, found a lifeline through a deal announced on Monday in which Sprint will buy a one-third stake in the service for an undisclosed amount. The arrangement injects some needed investment in Tidal and allows it, at least for now, to remain an underdog in a streaming market that has become dominated by giants.

""Tidal has struggled to make a dent in the streaming market and has shallower pockets than Spotify, Apple or Amazon,"" said Mark Mulligan, an analyst at Midia Research, a market research company. ""The Sprint deal gives it access to a big customer base, free marketing and a war chest to take on the streaming incumbents.""","Sprint bought a third of the service, which has struggled in a field dominated by streaming giants like Apple Music, Spotify and Pandora.",1acf04f3-1a87-5c19-87e4-fb9417f12377,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/24/business/media/24TIDAL2/24TIDAL2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=65e856e3dfa84bab5dc73e96235bfa5d1a1954ea461c53f08501f2dac1b87c73&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"As part of the deal with Sprint, Jay Z and the group of artist owners who helped introduce Tidal will continue to run the service.",1acf04f3-1a87-5c19-87e4-fb9417f12377,N24News/imgs/1acf04f3-1a87-5c19-87e4-fb9417f12377.jpg,16
Art & Design,AIDS Memorial Quilt to Return Home to San Francisco,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/arts/design/aids-memorial-quilt-san-francisco.html,"The AIDS Memorial Quilt, a vast network of patches commemorating the lives of people who have succumbed to illnesses related to the disease, will return to San Francisco, where its first panels were created in 1987.

The quilt's longtime steward, the NAMES Project Foundation, which is headquartered in Atlanta, will announce the move on Wednesday at a ceremony in Washington, which will be live-streamed at 11 a.m., where the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and other members of Congress are scheduled to attend . Next month, the quilt's more than 50,000, 3-by-6-foot panels will move to the National AIDS Memorial in San Francisco, and its associated archive of 200,000 personal items and documentation will relocate to the American Folklife Center at the Library of Congress in 2020.

""This announcement honors the stewardship by the NAMES Project Foundation over the past three decades in passionately caring for the quilt and ensures its permanent home will continue to forever honor its history, the lives, struggles, despair, inequity and hope that it represents,"" John Cunningham, executive director of the National AIDS Memorial, said in a statement.

At the height of the AIDS epidemic in the late '80s, a group that included Cleve Jones, Mike Smith and Gert McMullin came together in San Francisco to create the quilt as a way to memorialize the names of loved ones who had died. Since then, the quilt has grown to include the names of more than 105,000 individuals and portions have been displayed worldwide, as well as on the Ellipse and the National Mall.","The quilt's more than 50,000 panels will move to the National AIDS Memorial, while its archive of personal items will go to the Library of Congress.",9579456e-6939-5410-9858-d18088afd1f8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/22/arts/20quilt-still/20quilt-still-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=a24783089b3abcc1487cde645a08fb5c45f9c2f97ecdffd892000a4783827ceb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The AIDS Memorial Quilt on display at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. in 1992.",9579456e-6939-5410-9858-d18088afd1f8,N24News/imgs/9579456e-6939-5410-9858-d18088afd1f8.jpg,14
Science,A Prairie Flower That Flourishes With Fire,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/27/science/fire-coneflowers-echinacea-pollination.html,"Echinacea angustifolia, or the narrow-leaved purple coneflower, was found to produce more seeds and be more genetically diverse in areas that burned compared to those that didn't.



As fires continue to rage across Australia, destroying ecosystems and killing millions of animals, it's hard to imagine any good emerging from such devastation. But it's long been known that some small plants can benefit from a fire, because they grow back faster than grasses and trees, giving them an advantage in the battle for resources. A study published on Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences gives another explanation for that success, at least for one prairie plant that has been in decline: reproductive advantage. Purple coneflowers, also known as echinacea angustifolia, produce more seeds in years following fires, the new study shows, not just because there are fewer competitors for resources, but because a fire ""also changes the mating opportunities,"" said Stuart Wagenius, a conservation scientist at the Chicago Botanic Garden. Dr. Wagenius, who led the research, tracked a 40-hectare plot, or nearly 100 acres, of prairie land in Minnesota for 21 years as part of the Echinacea Project. The study found that coneflowers produced more seeds and were more genetically diverse in plots that were burned every few years, compared to those where fires were prevented.

Coneflowers don't bloom every year because it takes energy to produce a flower. Controlled burning in fall or spring triggered the flowers on the study plot to put out blooms -- often more than one -- the following summer. Dr. Wagenius found this synchrony both in terms of the years of flowering and the dates within those years. So, in the summer after a fire, more flowers were open at the same time, and bees were better able to pollinate the coneflowers, he said. ""It just makes sense that if there are more plants flowering, there's going to be better pollination,"" he said. Several other researchers not involved in the work said the group's findings were surprising and persuasive. ""They show that the effect of fire isn't what everybody assumed that it is,"" said Ingrid Parker, chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology at the University of California, Santa Cruz. ""It shows that the role of fire is even more interesting than we realized and there's a lot more to learn.""

Dr. Crone said the paper confirms in practice what has already been assumed in theory: that fires can be good for prairies. ""I think it's neat that this was mostly a pollination and reproductive effect, not only a better-nutrients-in-the-soil effect, and I think most of us would have expected it to be the other way around,"" Dr. Crone said. ""It is the first time I have seen that idea in response to fires."" The fires that helped the patch of prairie tracked in the new study are not at all like the infernos burning in Australia, or the ones that tore across California last year. Lightning causes frequent fires across the prairies, and prescribed fires have been set for centuries largely for land management and food production, so the prairies have evolved with low-intensity fires every few years. Without controlled burns or occasional fires, flammable materials like brush and dead grasses accumulate. Then, when a fire does occur, it burns hotter and travels farther, causing more damage, Dr. Wagenius said. The natural fires tend to come in the spring and fall when many animals are hibernating and many plants are dormant, so they are protected from the blaze, Dr. Wagenius said.

Theater,"Review: In 'Lewiston/Clarkston,' America at a Crossroads (Plus Dinner)",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/25/theater/lewiston-clarkston-review.html,"It's only fitting that Rattlestick Playwrights Theater would gut its Greenwich Village home to accommodate the unconventional production of ""Lewiston/Clarkston"" that opened there on Thursday. The 24-year-old company merely did for Samuel D. Hunter's new play what the play will do to you. Make that ""plays."" ""Lewiston"" and ""Clarkston,"" though thematically intertwined, are stand-alone 90-minute works, here produced in one evening that includes a sit-down dinner during the half-hour intermission. You can bring your own meal, or reserve a catered one with your ticket, but either way you'll need the break -- not so much to recover from ""Lewiston,"" which is lovely but mild, as to prepare for ""Clarkston,"" which is devastating. Each play involves an indirect descendant of one of the title cities' namesakes: Meriwether Lewis and William Clark of the landmark expedition that began in 1804. In ""Lewiston,"" set on the Idaho side of the Snake River border with Washington, Marnie, a 24-year-old who cites Lewis as an ancestor, returns from Seattle to homestead the land on which she and her forebears were raised. But most of that land, Marnie learns to her horror, has already been sold to a developer building a condo subdivision called Meriwether Terrace. On the sliver that remains, Alice, a flinty woman in her 70s, scrapes by selling dusty novelty fireworks from a roadside table draped in ratty flag bunting. Connor, Alice's 50-ish gay roommate, chips in with wages from his job at the local Walgreens.

Only the fireworks table is depicted literally in Dane Laffrey's minimal set, which for ""Lewiston"" consists of a rectangle of gray industrial carpet surrounded on three sides by audience. (There are 51 seats.) When Marnie pitches a tent in a corner, she is so close you may have to shift your feet, and when Alice detonates a contraband M-80 firework, you'll definitely recoil. Davis McCallum's beautifully calibrated staging is so intimate it seems to implicate you in its themes. [What's new onstage and off: Sign up for our Theater Update newsletter] That intimacy, enhanced by Fitz Patton's wonderfully lush sound design, compensates to some degree for a slightly abstract quality in ""Lewiston."" Though the characters are drawn with Mr. Hunter's typical sympathy and modesty, they seem more like chessmen being pushed around a board than the characters who populate his previous Idaho plays, including ""The Whale,"" ""Pocatello"" and ""The Harvest."" Marnie (Leah Karpel) is insufferable even when you learn what her big beef is; Alice (Kristin Griffith) is so tough that her eventual softening is anticlimactic. Only Connor (Arnie Burton) is specific enough -- and sufficiently independent of the playwright's manipulation -- to be touching. But he's peripheral to the drama. At the center of that drama is a ghost: Marnie's dead mother, whom we hear in a series of tape recordings made years earlier as she retraced, on foot, 1,200 miles of the Lewis and Clark trail. It may be lifelike that the absent woman exerts so much pull on both Marnie and Alice, who have more in common than at first appears; people are always wrestling with the past. But it leaves ""Lewiston"" to amble at a hiker's fixed pace over essentially flat terrain.

Questions of American restlessness and rootlessness may gnaw at you while chatting with fellow audience members at the communal tables. Learning where we all came from, I found myself wondering whether our frequent and sometimes violent relocations reflect an atavistic impulse to explore or a more personal need to escape. That turns out to be a ripe way to enter ""Clarkston,"" set mostly in a Costco on the Washington side of the river. There, Chris, a robust local, is showing Jake, an indirect descendant of William Clark, how to do the job of a late-shift stock boy. They carry giant jugs of cheese puffs and popcorn from pallets at one end of the space, now reconfigured as a rectangle with the audience on the two long sides, to display shelves at the other. Is this, the play asks, what's left of the wild frontier? If so, Chris (Edmund Donovan) doesn't seem to mind. A deceptively unsophisticated type, with a blond brush cut, he has never lived anywhere beyond the twin cities and has never seen an ocean. On the other hand, frail Jake (Noah Robbins) majored in postcolonial gender studies at Bennington. Like Marnie in ""Lewiston,"" he has retraced an ancestor's path from the country's periphery to its mountain interior in hopes of finding something to belong to. That he does not already feel that kind of belonging is not because he is gay, nor because he has Huntington's disease and may not survive a decade. It's more profound than identity or even death. He senses but cannot understand how privilege and intelligence have somehow, in him -- and, the play implies, in the country as a whole -- festered into confusion and anomie. Despite that, he develops an intense relationship with Chris, full of switchbacks and mortifications. Some of the mortifications are the kind that result when two people who may not be ideally suited to each other have a great need and few options. Others are familial. When Chris's volatile mother, Trisha, shows up, a tragic vein in the story is opened, with the heartbreaking Mr. Donovan at its surprising center. You may recognize Trisha subliminally; she is played by Heidi Armbruster, who provided the voice of Marnie's unstable mother in ""Lewiston."" There are many such pointers in each play toward the other: Marnie and Jake both pitch tents -- Jake badly; both plays include scenes that take place, somewhat baldly, on the Fourth of July. Unemployment, the closet and drug addiction are afflictions in common. But ""Clarkston"" is the richer drama, with themes that are more tightly bound to characters and a plot both surprising and inevitable. Its perfect ending -- for the first time using the space that was once Rattlestick's stage platform -- feels like a kind of apotheosis, or at least a small reward. Indeed, Mr. Hunter's golden diptych, no less than Mr. McCallum's spectacularly unspectacular production, suggests that small rewards may be the only kind available.","Samuel D.

Health,"For Alex Trebek, the Toughest Question: Can He Face Down Pancreatic Cancer?",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/07/health/alex-trebek-pancreatic-cancer.html,"For Alex Trebek, the Toughest Question: Can He Face Down Pancreatic Cancer?

The cancer that has struck Alex Trebek, the 78-year-old host of the television quiz show ""Jeopardy!,"" is uncommon and devastating: a Stage 4 malignancy of the pancreas, the insulin-producing organ that lies behind the stomach. Pancreatic cancer strikes about 55,000 people each year in the United States, accounting for 3 percent of all cancers but 7 percent of all cancer deaths. That's because it can be so difficult to detect and treat. Stage 4, unfortunately, is the most advanced level. The main risk factor is aging, and Mr. Trebek is ""in the right age range,"" said Dr. Ursina Teitelbaum, clinical director of the Pancreatic Cancer Research Center at the University of Pennsylvania. There are several types, but the most common by far is adenocarcinoma: Tumors arise in pancreatic glands that make enzymes to help digest foods.

Nearly all pancreatic tumors are of this type, said Dr. William Jarnagin, a pancreatic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. It's ""the kind of cancer most people think of when they say pancreatic cancer."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Why is this such a dreaded diagnosis? There is no screening test that can find it early, Dr. Teitelbaum said. The pancreas is deep in the body and hard even to biopsy. ""It is a fluffy organ nestled in a rich bed of blood vessels,"" Dr. Teitelbaum said. Those vessels serve as highways transporting the cancer cells to other organs. And it is a very aggressive cancer, a highly lethal disease with few good treatment options. Even in a patient who is fortunate -- who is among the 10 percent to 15 percent whose cancer is found when it still can be surgically removed -- the risk of recurrence is great. Up to 85 percent of patients who have surgery followed by chemotherapy have a recurrence at some point, usually within two years. Even those who survive five or more years are still at risk of another episode.

""We've seen that happen,"" Dr. Jarnagin said. ""It seems quite unfair."" Why can't the cancer be found early? The problem is that pancreatic cancer usually has no symptoms until it is far advanced. By the time patients complain of pain, unintended weight loss or jaundice -- typical symptoms -- the tumor tends to be well established. By the time the cancer can easily be seen in M.R.I. or CT scans, it almost always has spread beyond the pancreas, even if there are no obvious signs in other organs. How is it treated? If the tumor can be removed, doctors operate. Surgery is followed by chemotherapy to attack microscopic cancer cells that are left behind in the pancreas or are hiding in other organs. For patients whose cancers can be treated with surgery and chemotherapy, the median survival time is 54 months, although on rare occasions patients are cured. The rising survival rate is a huge advance, compared to what patients faced ten years ago. ""There was such nihilism,"" Dr. Teitelbaum said of the diagnosis then. Now new chemotherapy regimens have more than doubled survival times. ""It is really good news,"" she said. ""Patients are living longer and better."" In some men with localized pancreatic tumors, the malignancy has grown too large for surgery to be useful -- but it has not spread. These patients are treated with chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy. They have a median survival rate of 10 to 12 months. Patients with Stage 4 cancer, like Mr. Trebek, are not candidates for surgery, because the cancer has already spread throughout the body. Chemotherapy is the only option.",The iconic game show host has been handed a frightening diagnosis.

Economy,"In Comments, Fed Officials Signal New Economic Push",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/business/economy/02fed.html,"WASHINGTON  Momentum within the Federal Reserve this week continued to build toward resuming purchases of huge amounts of government debt to help the flagging economic recovery. The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the most powerful of the 12 Fed regional presidents, made a significant argument for the strategy Friday, joining similar expressions of cautious support this week by his counterparts in Boston and Chicago. Their statements helped solidify a belief on Wall Street that the central bank was likely to resume large-scale purchases of Treasury securities after the Nov. 2 elections. The Fed has kept short-term interest rates, its main policy tool, near zero since December 2008. The theory behind the new debt-buying strategy is that the central bank can free up credit by creating money to buy long-term assets and therefore make the cost of long-run borrowing, already low, even cheaper. Gridlock over fiscal policy in Washington has most likely added pressure on the Fed to use monetary policy to support the economy, though Fed officials have not publicly said that. What the officials are saying, in increasing unison, is that inflation is undesirably low, well below the implicit target of about 2 percent, and that unemployment, at 9.6 percent, is far too high.

""Viewed through the lens of the Federal Reserve's dual mandate  the pursuit of the highest level of employment consistent with price stability  the current situation is wholly unsatisfactory,"" the New York Fed president, William C. Dudley, said in a speech in Midtown Manhattan. He suggested that the Fed should act unless economic conditions noticeably improve soon. His perspective is believed to be in line with that of Janet L. Yellen, who was confirmed Wednesday as the Fed's vice chairwoman. Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, is increasingly viewed as sympathetic to that thinking but he has not disclosed his stance. Other Fed officials backed Mr. Dudley's view. On Friday, Charles L. Evans, president of the Chicago Fed, said in Rome that it ""would be desirable"" for the Fed to provide additional monetary stimulus. ""We still have a long road ahead before we catch up to the level of activity we would have achieved in the absence of the crisis, or any other shock,"" he said. And on Wednesday in New York, Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Boston Fed, sounded a similar note. ""While the economy is growing, it is currently growing too slowly to significantly reduce the unemployment rate or stem disinflationary pressures created by the high degree of slack in the economy,"" he warned.

The Fed bought $1.7 trillion in long-term securities  a mixture of mortgage-linked bonds and Treasury securities  from January 2009 to March 2010 to put downward pressure on long-term rates. But the slowdown in economic growth in recent months has caused the Fed to contemplate a second dose of monetary medicine.  Critics, notably a small but vocal minority of inflation hawks among the Fed's leaders, believe that the medicine could have dangerous future side effects. But the consensus seems to be coalescing around the position of the doves  a group Mr. Dudley has apparently joined  that the persistently high unemployment rate is unacceptable, particularly at a time when inflation is so low. Mr. Dudley discounted a much-discussed alternative to quantitative easing: using the Fed's public communications to make it clear it intended to keep the benchmark short-term rate  the federal funds rate at which banks lend to one another overnight  at nearly zero for even longer than the markets already expect. That approach could help lower inflation expectations, which play a crucial role in determining future price movements. But those expectations are already very low, and Mr. Dudley said the approach might merely create uncertainty about future inflation instead of lowering expectations further. Instead, Mr. Dudley spoke favorably about quantitative easing, citing calculations suggesting that ""$500 billion worth of purchases would provide about as much stimulus as a reduction in the federal funds rate of between half a point and three-quarters of a point."" That effect would be dependent on how long the markets expected the Fed to hold onto the assets, he added. Lower long-term rates would support home prices and household net worth, ideally making housing more affordable, permit more homeowners to refinance their mortgages, and reduce the cost of borrowing for businesses, Mr. Dudley said. Mr. Dudley did outline two potential drawbacks to quantitative easing. One is that expanding the Fed's exceptionally large balance sheet even further could unsettle inflation expectations  a concern Mr. Dudley said could be allayed with a demonstration by the Fed that it had the tools and willingness to return to normal monetary policy when the time came. The other objection is that additional asset purchases would expose the Fed to fluctuations in short-term rates. When those rates eventually rise, the Fed will have less money to turn over to the Treasury each year.

Mr. Dudley made it clear that he did not consider either concern insurmountable. ""My assessment is that both the current levels of unemployment and inflation and the time frame over which they are likely to return to levels consistent with our mandate are unacceptable,"" he said, adding, that ""the longer this situation prevails"" the greater the risk that a new shock could unmoor the economy further and push it ""closer to outright deflation."" But skeptics have been equally outspoken. On Friday, Richard W. Fisher, president of the Dallas Fed, said a new round of debt-buying ""could flood the engine of the economy with gas that might later ignite inflation."" Charles I. Plosser of the Philadelphia Fed said Wednesday in a speech in Vineland, N.J., that ""it is difficult, in my view, to see how additional asset purchases by the Fed, even if they move interest rates on long-term bonds down by 10 or 20 basis points, will have much impact on the near-term outlook for employment."" (A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.) Mr. Plosser warned that additional action could hurt the Fed's credibility and create the impression that the Fed was trying to ""monetize"" the deficit by printing money. Mr. Dudley on Friday called that fear ""fundamentally mistaken,"" saying the Fed would be creating money only to help get the recovery back on track, not to relieve the country's fiscal strains. Even as some Fed officials staked their ground, others appeared to be on the fence. Narayana R. Kocherlakota of the Minneapolis Fed said on Wednesday in London that a new round of quantitative easing would be less powerful than the last one because the financial markets had stabilized, but he did not rule out the approach.",The Fed appears increasingly likely to resume large-scale purchases of Treasury securities after the Nov. 2 midterm elections.,7079fba1-69f3-5b9e-b348-99962c2a93c0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/10/02/business/02fed-span/02fed-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=5d9adac0e2f163e6302106e5dde9fdf6055c23874b705f9ee9257729e663d67f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"William C.

Music,The Genius of 'The Nutcracker'? It's the Sugar Plum Fairy,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/23/arts/music/nutcracker-new-york-city-ballet-tchaikovsky.html,"Andrew Litton, New York City Ballet's music director, says his favorite page from the score of ""The Nutcracker"" is the opening of ""The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy.""

The enchanting melody of ""The Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy"" from Tchaikovsky's ""The Nutcracker,"" which returns to New York City Ballet on Friday for its annual run through Dec. 30, has transcended ballet to become shorthand for Christmas itself. Despite the tune's ubiquity, it never gets old for Andrew Litton, City Ballet's music director, who will lead the company's orchestra in some of the ""Nutcracker"" performances this season. Asked about his favorite page from the ballet's score, he chose the Sugar Plum Fairy's solo. ""I'm actually in love with the whole two hours,"" he said in an interview this week at Lincoln Center. ""I'm only conducting seven of the performances, but the seventh will feel just as great as the first.""

For all the magic of the Sugar Plum Fairy on the page, Mr. Litton said, her dance is made even better by George Balanchine's choreography for City Ballet. The ballet may be a yuletide standard for theaters around the world, but its premiere in 1892 was a flop. Balanchine was among the choreographers who led a ""Nutcracker"" resurgence in the mid-20th century. His version, which has been performed at City Ballet every year since 1954, is famous for its magical sets and stage effects, like the Christmas tree that grows several stories tall. But beyond that, Mr. Litton said, Balanchine elevated ""The Nutcracker"" beyond its musical greatness.

""He makes Stravinsky better than Stravinsky,"" Mr. Litton said, referring to the long relationship Balanchine had with that composer. ""So many of the pieces we do are just enhanced and made better by Balanchine."" Mr. Litton spent decades in the world of symphony orchestras before he became City Ballet's music director -- fittingly, during ""Nutcracker"" season in 2015. But it's one thing to conduct in a concert hall, and quite another to lead a ballet orchestra. The City Ballet players are valued for their attention and agility: Tempos change from night to night, from dancer to dancer.

""I always tell them, 'Don't assume,'"" Mr. Litton said. ""Sometimes I warn the front desk strings that the next night is going to be much slower. When I say that, I mean two clicks of the metronome, but that's a lot to a musician."" The orchestra typically has just one rehearsal, and often not with the dancers onstage. ""It's not like opera,"" Mr. Litton said. ""We only have the luxury of that when it's something new or unusual that requires a lot of stage-orchestra cuing, like 'Fancy Free.'"" ""The Nutcracker"" is one of those ballets that requires time in the auditorium, because the dozens of children in the cast require more rehearsal time. Mr. Litton has a soft spot for them, and for the youngest members of the audience.

But I get the biggest kick out of it. It's so amazing because Tchaikovsky just had this brilliant idea to get the effect that [the choreographer Marius] Petipa wanted with the celesta. Can you describe the character of this instrument? For centuries, people had been looking for a keyboard instrument that would hit bells. With harpsichord, it was plucking strings; piano, it was hammers hitting strings. The celesta uses felt hammers to hit the bells. It's a much more smooth and beautiful sound. The inventor called it celesta because ""celestial"" -- heaven. He thought it sounded heavenly. Tchaikovsky discovered the celesta, which had been invented in the 1880s, on a trip to France. He wasn't the first composer to use it in an orchestral piece, but he was the first person to give it a massive solo. It proved to be such an influential move. From that moment on, the floodgates opened. Everyone wrote for celesta.

How does this dance and the rest of ""The Nutracker"" compare with Tchaikovsky's other ballet scores? It's his last ballet. He didn't really like the idea of the project, but he obliged. And it ended up being one of his most successful pieces. It's ironic that it was approached with such reluctance. So often that seems to happen in history. ""The Sleeping Beauty"" is the ultimate dancer's ballet. But musically, it perhaps doesn't have the inventiveness that ""The Nutcracker"" does. It's also an hour longer. When a composer has a smaller template, it forces an inventiveness. ""Waltz of the Flowers"" may be the longest number, and it's under six minutes. I put the ""Waltz of the Flowers"" up against any waltz written by anybody. It's certainly one of the top five waltzes of all time, and I include all of the Strauss family in that sweeping statement. And the great theme of the pas de deux, which might be lost on the children, was written on a dare. Someone said, ""I bet you can't write a melody that's just a scale."" But there it is; it's incredible. We also have his Russianness coming out in the Trepak. And the overture is not for the whole orchestra; it's for the upper strings. By doing that, he takes us into this world of tiny tots. A total lightness, which is a brilliant idea. Then, as soon as the curtain's up, we see grown-ups -- the parents, the grandparents. So it's back to normal orchestration. It's a genius stroke. How is it different to play to a younger audience? There are hazards. There was a performance last year where a little child sat on his grandfather's lap right behind me. He had this huge bag of M&Ms. The whole time I could hear this chomping. You can't say, ""Please stop eating those."" Then I kept thinking: ""Surely, that's enough. He's going to be sick. Oh no, he's going to be sick on me."" So, it's a little distracting. The ballerinas look at the conductor, and they were all distracted, too. Normally that just doesn't happen. There's crying, but this is the piece for it. You don't bring kids to Mahler's Ninth. One of the mantras of classical music is that there's no new audience. Well, we get one every season with this piece. Every child from New York, every child who visits, experiences this if they're lucky. It's so fun to go out every night and know you're going to reach some of these little kids. Some of them will squirm through it. But some will be transformed by it.","As the classic dance returns to New York City Ballet, the company's music director explains the page of the score that reveals Tchaikovsky's daring.",bb3d78cb-b06f-524e-a599-7e403e8f7cce,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/24/arts/24NUTCRACKER-MUSIC3/24NUTCRACKER-MUSIC3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=14eb891513955de41addd7944fc2137cb108788f7b47bcbf4842b64f3b14af0b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Ashley Hod as the Sugar Plum Fairy.,bb3d78cb-b06f-524e-a599-7e403e8f7cce,N24News/imgs/bb3d78cb-b06f-524e-a599-7e403e8f7cce.jpg,12
Theater,"Rebecca Hall and Morgan Spector: Together, Onstage and Off",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/25/theater/rebecca-hall-and-morgan-spector-together-onstage-and-off.html,"The actors Rebecca Hall and Morgan Spector met in rehearsals for the 2014 Broadway revival of Sophie Treadwell's ""Machinal."" The play opened. The play closed. Some months after that, they began dating. A year later, they married. ""Machinal"" is an expressionist drama that pictures marriage as so profoundly soul-destroying that a woman's only recourse is to brain her husband. So as courtship stories go, this one is at least a little funny. Now Mr. Spector and Ms. Hall are onstage together again, playing Rachel and Tom, an English married couple at the heart of Clare Lizzimore's unsettling ""Animal,"" which opens on June 6 at Atlantic Stage 2. A domestic drama, a psychological thriller and something of a medical mystery, ""Animal"" tracks Rachel, a career woman suffering from anxiety and depression and maybe something worse, and the husband who struggles to help her. This marriage is troubled; it is also deeply compassionate. No one gets brained. Describing the relationship between Rachel and Tom, Ms. Lizzimore, speaking by telephone from London, used the word ""dogged"" then apologized for the word's dowdiness.

And trauma is thick on the ground here. Like the Young Woman in ""Machinal,"" or Christine Chubbuck in the film ""Christine,"" another recent star turn for Ms. Hall, Rachel of ""Animal"" is a woman skittering toward insanity. Ms. Hall, 35, an actress of nuance and ferocity, has a habit of taking on these roles. And Mr. Spector, 36, an exhilarating actor in his own right (""Russian Transport,"" the coming Spike series ""The Mist""), has a habit of supporting her, onstage and off it, too. They first learned of ""Animal"" when the director Gaye Taylor Upchurch, who had overseen the play's 2015 world premiere in Washington, cast them in a reading. At the time, Mr. Spector was assigned the role of Dan, a threatening young man to whom Rachel feels an instinctual, pheromonal attraction. Ms. Hall signed on to the production, fascinated by the way it put Rachel's unstable, untrustworthy perceptions at the center. (Ms. Hall said that her ""biggest fear is probably going insane,"" so perversely this is the kind of part that attracts her.) Mr. Spector thought he could do more with the role of Tom, a good man and a strong one who wants to help his wife through her ordeal, just as Mr. Spector wants to help his own wife through what he called ""a beast of a role"" and ""crazy hard.""

""I'm almost glad I'm in the play so I can know how hard she's working in a real, visceral sense, what it's costing her to do it,"" he said. Ms. Hall acknowledged that cost. ""If you fully believe that the world around you is that fractious and that fragile and that tenuous and that frightening, then your body feels that, too,"" she said.

She was speaking in the restaurant of the Maritime Hotel, a bright tiled room across the street from the rehearsal space. So was he. But not at the same time. Though they often work together (Mr. Spector has had supporting roles in ""Christine"" and also in ""Permission,"" a coming film about monogamy and its discontents starring Ms. Hall), they make strict demarcations between their personal and professional lives. They'll talk about one, not the other. They want to be judged as individual artists, not as a two-for-one special, and they insisted, in a manner forthright and justifiably exasperated, on separate interviews. ""We work together, but our relationship is still ours,"" Ms. Hall explained. Mr. Spector had said the same thing in the same seat in almost the same words, just 20 minutes before. In case you're wondering, neither of them behaved fussily or self-importantly, but like two people who would be a lot happier if they could keep their private lives to themselves and their cats. (Yes, gossip hounds, they both let slip that they have cats. Mr. Spector said that those cats get mad when they work late, ""but not that mad."") They know that appearing onstage together makes curiosity inevitable, but as Ms. Hall said, the idea that ""because we work together the world is allowed to have access to our relationship, that doesn't quite make sense to me.""

Yet that relationship does slink into the work. At a weekday rehearsal, while Ms. Hall, Mr. Spector and Ms. Upchurch were huddled together choreographing the final moments of a scene, Mr. Spector patted his wife's arm -- gently, rhythmically -- a gesture of camaraderie as they navigated a difficult passage. Ms. Hall noted that Mr. Spector ""has a really tremendous instinct to help everyone around him do their best work,"" but this seemed more intimate. Ms. Upchurch welcomed this intimacy. With only a few weeks to stage a new play, hiring actors who come in the door with ""that amount of trust already,"" is an advantage and a pleasure, she said. Still, trust doesn't necessarily make for identical styles of acting. Yes, both Mr. Spector and Ms. Hall are dynamic, intelligent and emotionally labile. Both, as Ms. Upchurch said, will ""just kind of crash into a scene just to try it this way or that way."" And Lyndsey Turner, who directed the pair in ""Machinal,"" wrote in an email that ""unflinching accuracy, a profound connection with language and a genuine curiosity about who we are and why we do the things we do"" describes the work of both. But he's a Northern California dude -- part hardman, part goofball -- who feels comfortable describing a scene's ""vibes,"" and she's hyperarticulate theater royalty, the daughter of the director Sir Peter Hall and the acclaimed soprano Maria Ewing. (It was in working with her father that Ms. Hall first began to put those work-life boundaries in place.) More important, Ms. Hall seems to dissolve her lithe frame and fresh, freckled face into the roles she plays, while Mr. Spector seems to mold each one around his expressive grin and brawny physique. (Even in casual rehearsal wear, Mr. Spector has a body that suggests a passionate relationship with a biceps press, and he recently appeared as a young Sylvester Stallone in the boxing drama ""Chuck."") ""It's sort of like the difference between fission and fusion,"" said Brian Crano, the director of ""Permission,"" pausing a moment to try to remember which nuclear reaction was which. Mr. Spector ""is exploding out,"" he said, while Ms. Hall's characters tend to shatter internally, to devastating effect.","They met while cast in the same play, married, and now appear together again, in ""Animal,"" which opens at Atlantic Stage 2.",46634dd8-158b-5a09-adef-8b1aeb3374fe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/05/28/arts/28SPECTORHALL1/28SPECTORHALL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=28438ba2632f729f2be131fa69e3e1843c9db1c273b0941cd702086a5d84445e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The actors and married couple Rebecca Hall and Morgan Spector.,46634dd8-158b-5a09-adef-8b1aeb3374fe,N24News/imgs/46634dd8-158b-5a09-adef-8b1aeb3374fe.jpg,10
Art & Design,Judge Dismisses Suit Seeking Picasso Painting From the Met,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/arts/design/judge-dismisses-suit-seeking-picasso-painting-from-the-met.html,"A judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit by the great-grand-niece of a German Jewish businessman that asked the Metropolitan Museum of Art to return one of its most valuable Picassos, ""The Actor."" Judge Loretta A. Preska, of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, ruled that the estate of the businessman, Paul Leffmann, had failed to show that he had been forced to sell the painting under duress after he fled the Nazis.

In the original lawsuit filed in September 2016, lawyers representing the great-grandniece, Laurel Zuckerman, administrator of the estate, said that Mr. Leffmann had been forced to sell his home and businesses in Cologne, Germany, before he fled with his wife, Alice, to Italy in 1937, as conditions in Europe deteriorated.

The painting was sold in 1938, before the Leffmanns moved on to Switzerland and finally to Brazil.

The lawsuit argued that the sale was made under duress to the Paris art dealers Hugo Perls, a collector of Picasso's work, and Paul Rosenberg, Picasso's dealer, for $13,200.

A year later, the painting was lent to the Museum of Modern Art with an insured value of $18,000, and in 1941, Thelma Chrysler Foy acquired the painting through New York's Knoedler Gallery for $22,500 -- both values were evidence, the estate argued, that the 1938 sale had been at a discount. Ms. Foy donated the painting to the Met in 1952, where it has been displayed since.","Laurel Zuckerman, administrator of the estate of Paul and Alice Leffmann, claimed Picasso's 'The Actor' had been sold under duress in Nazi-era Europe.",7fd5b88c-7cf6-5aab-b2ab-bf91e28233f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/10/arts/09PICASSO-item/09PICASSO-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=7dd0be5396cad357def022699ec50259c87487c1098bcf7ce86be82795ab51d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A lawsuit seeking possession of or compensation for Picasso's ""The Actor"" from the Metropolitan Museum of Art was dismissed in federal court.",7fd5b88c-7cf6-5aab-b2ab-bf91e28233f2,N24News/imgs/7fd5b88c-7cf6-5aab-b2ab-bf91e28233f2.jpg,14
Science,Shaking Up the Dinosaur Family Tree,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/22/science/dinosaur-family-tree.html,"For more than a century, the placement of dinosaurs on the branches of their family tree has been based on the shape of their hips. This classification has now been radically challenged by proponents of a new tree which, if accepted, swaps large subfamilies around, sheds new light on dinosaurs' evolution and suggests they may have originated not in South America, as widely assumed, but perhaps in some Northern Hemisphere locality such as Scotland. A Victorian paleontologist, Harry Seeley, declared in 1888 that dinosaurs should be divided into the bird-hipped (Ornithischia) and the lizard-hipped (Saurischia) categories that have been accepted ever since. Under this system, the heavily armored stegosaurs and ankylosaurs are placed on the Ornithischian branch of the family tree. The Saurischian branch includes both sauropods like the herbivorous diplodocus, and theropods like the meat-eating tyrannosaurs.

This longstanding classification has now been disputed by Matthew G. Baron of the University of Cambridge. Mr. Baron is a graduate student and his rewriting of the dinosaur family tree is a project to attain his Ph.D. But his ideas are supported by his two supervisors and co-authors, David B. Norman of the University of Cambridge, and Paul M. Barrett of the Natural History Museum in London, and by a prodigious database he has constructed of dinosaur anatomical features. Mr. Baron started his work on the Ornithischian dinosaurs but came to feel they did not fit well in their place on the accepted family tree. With his supervisors' encouragement, he set out to reconsider the entire dinosaur classification system. More than 1,000 species have already been identified, most of them dating from between 200 million and 66 million years ago. Dinosaurs became the dominant terrestrial species after the first date, and perished, all save the lineage leading to birds, at the second. Mr. Baron spent three years visiting museums throughout the world and assessed important dinosaur fossils for the presence of 457 diagnostic anatomical features. Based on this information, a computer program called TNT arranged the dinosaur specimens in possible family trees. After analyzing 32 billion trees, the computer spat out the best possible arrangement of Mr. Baron's three years' worth of data collection. The run took just five minutes. The new family tree of dinosaurs, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, is quite unlike the old. ""The results of this study challenge more than a century of dogma and recover an unexpected tree topology that necessitates fundamental reassessment of early dinosaur evolution,"" Mr. Baron and his supervisors write.

Essentially they have found that the Ornithischian dinosaurs have many similarities with the theropods and so probably shared a common ancestor. As it happens, Thomas Huxley, the celebrated 19th century champion of Darwin's theory of evolution, also thought Ornithischia and theropods belonged together in the same group, which he called Ornithoscelida. Mr. Baron says this name should be revived, with the two main branches of the new family tree being the Ornithoscelida and the Saurischia.

Mr. Baron's revolutionary new family tree may not be immediately accepted but experts seem likely to give it a serious hearing because of its database, the largest ever assembled, and its use of a standard tree-drawing program. ""It will be interesting to see how paleontologists receive this original and provocative reassessment of dinosaur origins and relationships,"" Kevin Padian, a dinosaur expert at the University of California, Berkeley, wrote in an accompanying commentary in Nature. ""It's a radical proposal with a reasonable basis but no one expects it will be the last word,"" Dr. Padian said in an interview. Given that such a sudden shift in the dinosaur family tree might even be possible, people could wonder if dinosaur experts know what they're doing, he said. His answer is that they do, but they have been faced with an unusual problem. There has been an explosion of new discoveries in the last 30 years, showing that new dinosaur groups evolved with a mix of old features inherited from their ancestors and new ones shaped by natural selection. But the new features are the same in many cases, an instance of what biologists call convergent evolution, making it very hard to assign each group to its right place on the dinosaur family tree. Paul Sereno, a dinosaur specialist the University of Chicago who laid the basis for the modern version of Seeley's classification, said the new paper would certainly stir the pot but he couldn't see what new features or scoring system had contributed to the new result. Mr. Baron said his work was not based on any new diagnostic features but on more data and the absence of any prior assumptions about what the tree should look like. Having a correctly drawn family tree allows paleontologists to peer more deeply into the origins of the dinosaurs, because the species that lie close to the root of the major families may carry the same traits as the first dinosaur. Based on his tree, Mr. Baron believes that the original dinosaurs were small, two-footed animals with large grasping hands, as others have said before, but also omnivorous. Early dinosaurs had both knifelike teeth for eating meat and flatter teeth for chewing plants.

""In the very harsh climates of the late Triassic, being a generalist is probably a clever strategy,"" Mr. Baron said. ""The ability to run fast and eat anything and grasp with the hands is what gave dinosaurs their advantage."" A critical stage in human evolution was walking upright, which freed the hands for grasping tools and weapons. ""The parallels with human evolution are very noticeable and make you wonder what they could have achieved,"" Mr. Baron said. ""Toward the end, certain groups like the velociraptors were starting to get intelligent."" The new tree implies that dinosaurs emerged some 247 million years ago, a little earlier than previous estimates, and that their origin may not have been in South America, where several very early dinosaurs have been found. Some species that could have shared a common ancestor with the first dinosaur have been found in places now part of the Northern Hemisphere, such as Saltopus elginensis, a small dinosaurlike creature found in Scotland. But Dr. Norman said present sampling did not allow any region to be identified as the dinosaurs' place of origin, only that the Northern Hemisphere was just as likely as the Southern. The proposed new family tree of dinosaurs has a lot of statistical support, Dr. Norman said. ""That doesn't mean it's right, just that it's the best we can do with the data we've got at the moment,"" he said.",A Ph.D candidate and a computer program that took five minutes to run may upend the dinosaur classification system that has been used for more than a century.,20bd7489-182a-5842-a041-66b2bb628ad5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/28/science/23DINO/23DINO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=25264d3fd018a48390d3b1fe25b7b65514f7429a17a2c019136a2a84341ff7c2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The proposed new family tree of dinosaurs.

Your Money,Ways to Save (and Not Spend) Your Tax Refund,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/17/your-money/ways-to-save-and-not-spend-your-tax-refund.html,"More than 70 percent of taxpayers are expected to get refunds this year, the Internal Revenue Service reports. That represents a big opportunity, according to savings advocates and financial advisers, since many Americans struggle to set aside cash for emergencies. Last year, the average refund was nearly $2,900 -- a significant amount of money for many people. ""For a lot of families, it's the biggest financial event of the year,"" said Timothy Flacke, executive director of Commonwealth, a nonprofit in Boston that promotes saving and financial security. There is some indication that more people are focusing on saving at least part of their tax refund. In a Bankrate survey, more than a third said they would save or invest their refund this year, while just 6 percent said they would use it to splurge on a special treat, like a vacation or shopping spree. (The telephone survey, which polled 1,001 people in February, has a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points.) Millennials in particular were more likely to say they would save their refund, said Sarah Berger, a personal finance specialist at Bankrate. Perhaps, she said, because they have lived through a recession, they are aware of the need to save, in case of a job loss or illness.

Research from the Pew Charitable Trusts in 2015 found that 41 percent of households said they could not cover an unexpected expense of $2,000. And last year, the Federal Reserve reported that nearly half of American families would struggle to meet an emergency expense of even $400. Saving is particularly challenging for families whose income fluctuates widely, new research from Pew finds. ""Families have very little liquid savings,"" said Erin Currier, director of Pew's financial security and mobility project. Tax refunds can offer a chance for people to save, whether by establishing a rainy-day fund or setting up a retirement account, said Mr. Flacke of Commonwealth (which was formerly known as the D2D Fund). Getting a large chunk of your annual income as a lump sum ""is a big deal,"" he said.

Acting before you have the cash in hand can help make sure you save some of the refund. One option, Mr. Flacke noted, is to receive your refund by direct deposit, and have the I.R.S. divide the money into separate accounts -- say, half to a savings account and half to your checking account.

Mr. Flacke also said consumers might consider buying savings bonds with their tax refunds. Tax time is the only remaining opportunity for people to purchase paper savings bonds; otherwise, consumers must buy digital savings bonds from the federal government. One way to force yourself to save, said Robert Steen, a certified financial planner with USAA, is to get in the habit of talking with friends and family about your goal, whether in person or on social media. ""If you share it,"" he said, ""it becomes more real."" Here are some questions and answers about using tax refunds to begin saving: How can I split my tax refund? To do this, file Form 8888 with your tax return. The form lets you divide the money among as many as three accounts. Commonwealth and America Saves, a nonprofit that promotes saving, co-sponsor an annual ""save your refund"" promotion, which offers participants the chance to win multiple awards of $100, and a grand prize of $25,000, if they save part of their tax refund. You must split your refund using Form 8888 and save at least $50 to participate. How do I buy savings bonds with my tax refund? To buy savings bonds, you will also need to file Form 8888 and indicate that you want to purchase bonds with all or part of your refund. This year, taxpayers can use their refunds to buy up to $5,000 in I-series United States savings bonds, which pay a flat interest rate and an additional rate based on inflation. The bonds may be purchased in $50 increments. What if my refund is very large? Refunds can act as forced savings, but an outsize refund means that you have missed out on the chance to earn interest on that money. That was not such a big deal in recent years, because interest rates on insured savings accounts have been paltry. But with rates ticking upward, there are likely better places to keep your cash.",The I.R.S. makes it easy to use your refund to buy savings bonds or to divide your refund among various bank accounts.,3c93a12e-3677-536e-9090-02fe7f0e3148,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/18/business/18adviser1/18adviser1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=2721f9270d84c41449f9274707fbfd1ce0121717bbcb59d75fd863838cab2fec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An H&R Block storefront in the Bronx.

Books,"In the Caribbean and Beyond, Aunties Are So Much More Than Just Family",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/17/books/review/a-million-aunties-alecia-mckenzie.html,"During a discussion of my own novel, ""These Ghosts Are Family,"" at a private book club, a group of Caribbean women told me that the one aspect of the story -- which teems with the supernatural -- that they'd found the most unbelievable was when a character dies and has his identity stolen because he has no family except for an aging grandmother to come looking for him. ""That would never happen in the Caribbean,"" one participant said. ""He would have cousins, he would have neighbors, uncles -- he would have aunties!"" The Commonwealth Prize-winning, Jamaican-born author Alecia McKenzie's tender new novel -- an emotionally resonant ode to adopted families and community resilience -- fills this gap.

""A Million Aunties"" is a polyphonic narrative with a cast of characters who have experienced betrayal, disaster and loss at different stages of life. Chris, a young Black painter from New York, has just arrived in the fictional village of Port Segovia in rural Jamaica, searching for beauty and solitude after his wife's death in a terrorist attack. It's his first time visiting the island without his Jamaican mother, who died from cancer years before. At the advice of his agent and friend, Stephen, he has come to board with Miss Della, Stephen's auntie, a term that transcends blood relation. Once ""Stephen had mumbled something about his aunt getting him from a place called Anfields Children's Home in Kingston,"" Chris recalls. ""She'd taken him to the country to help her grow plants and told everyone he was her nephew, and it had gone from being a lie to being true.""

The novel moves between faraway settings of Jamaica, New York and France (where McKenzie herself lives), and though supporting characters momentarily take center stage, it's Chris, Stephen and Della around whom all the others seem to orbit. Stephen serves as a bridge, determined to bring people together so they can experience the same healing and warmth that Miss Della and her community gave him as a child. ""In his most morbid moments,"" McKenzie writes, ""he sometimes thought: Lose a mother, gain a million aunties.""

Like Chris and Stephen, the broader community within this novel is also transnational. While most of the characters are Jamaican artists and their loved ones, McKenzie brings in others from different countries throughout the African diaspora, such as Feliciane, a French and West African installation artist caught in a love triangle between Stephen and her new boyfriend from the island. Of course no family exists without conflict. In a moving monologue, Chris's father, an African-American Vietnam veteran in failing health, laments Chris's late mother's dismissive attitude toward American racism as ""the arrogance and confidence of growing up as a majority.""","In Alecia McKenzie's new novel, ""A Million Aunties,"" a Black painter seeks solace from personal tragedy in the arms of his Jamaican community.",26dc6f89-1ae6-556d-95d6-b1c73e21dcc9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/03/books/review/Card1/Card1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=537&w=1024&s=f69de11daadd68d5708d020a80a70e7c88ec4a37abd10338e6630fe1b51169b2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Alecia McKenzie&rsquo;s tender new novel is an emotionally resonant ode to adopted families and community resilience.,26dc6f89-1ae6-556d-95d6-b1c73e21dcc9,N24News/imgs/26dc6f89-1ae6-556d-95d6-b1c73e21dcc9.jpg,13
Health,Need a Mental Health Day? Some States Give Students the Option,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/health/oregon-mental-health-days.html,"Depression and anxiety. The state of the country. Climate change. Mass shootings. Today's students are grappling with a variety of issues beyond the classroom. To that end, lawmakers in two states have recently recognized the importance of the mental health of their students by allowing them to take sick days just for that. The measures ""empower"" children to take care of their mental health, one expert said. On July 1, a law in Oregon went into effect giving students five mental health days in a three-month period. In 2018, Utah changed the definition of a student's ""valid excuse"" to miss a day to include an illness ""which may be mental or physical."" According to a recent study, teenagers named depression as a problem among their peers. Others blamed their anxiety on politics or climate change. In Oregon, the bill was supported by several teenagers. One recent graduate, Hailey Hardcastle, told The Associated Press that the bill was inspired by politically active students in Parkland, Fla., and that she and her peers wanted to address mental health issues in schools.

Another former student, Derek Evans, voiced his approval. ""Dealing with anxiety throughout high school has always left me tired, exhausted up against some weeks, and the difference one day makes is honestly life-changing,"" he told Fox 12 Oregon. Ms. Hardcastle said some parents had opposed the bill, raising concerns that students could take mental health days by pretending to be sick. But other parents cited a real need for the days. The parents of Chloe Wilson, who died by suicide in 2018, told The Associated Press that their daughter, who had faced bullying after coming out as bisexual, had pretended to be sick in order to stay home from school. ""Because she lied to get her absences excused, we didn't get to have those mental health conversations that could have saved her life,"" her mother, Roxanne Wilson, said. The new laws are ""a huge win, especially for individuals and families that are affected by mental health conditions,"" said Jennifer Rothman, senior manager for youth and young adult initiatives for National Alliance on Mental Illness.

Suicide rates for children have been rising as well, Ms. Rothman said. ""The suicide rates for kids are not going down,"" she said. ""They are actually rising very quickly, which I think is making schools think a little bit more about mental health conditions."" According to a 2017 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, suicide is the second leading cause of death for 10- to 34-year-olds. A 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance report from the centers showed that during the 12 months before the survey, 19 percent of high school students had been bullied on school property and another 7.4 percent had attempted suicide. From 1999 to 2016, suicide rates increased 28.2 percent in Oregon, and rose 46.5 percent in Utah, according to the centers. Ms. Rothman said the days off not only give students a chance to speak up about their needs, but help break the stigma associated with mental health. She said children who are ""quietly suffering"" from symptoms of mental illness would most benefit from taking the days. ""We have a lot of kids that are dealing with this in silence because they're embarrassed or they think people are going to judge them and not believe them,"" Ms. Rothman said.

She said federal mental health education should be available to students, school staff and family members. The lack of such education hinders the ability to recognize and understand the warning signs, Ms. Rothman said. Adults may think that children are overreacting or that their complaining about mental health problems is a phase. ""I don't know that it coddles children when they have strep throat that keeps them at home and they have a fever,"" Debbie Plotnick, vice president of mental health and systems advocacy at Mental Health America, said Monday. ""It is not coddling adults when they need a mental health day."" Ms. Plotnick said the laws allow children with mental illness to focus on their health instead of attending school only to suffer from ""presenteeism,"" which she described as being physically present but ""not fully present"" and responsive to what is happening around them. She said that there were few risks to giving children the agency to take mental health days and that the legislation was a step in the right direction for the country. ""We think that this will be a model for other states to follow,"" Ms. Plotnick said. ""As a matter of public policy, for decades we have waited until stage four, until crisis, and then treating it only through incarceration or having kids thrown out of school,"" Ms. Plotnick said. ""We think that this kind of legislation will help people reach out when they need to, not be afraid to do so and not be ashamed."" While the legislation in Utah and Oregon has made headlines, it's not the first time a state has acted in favor of a child's mental health. Minnesota passed a bill in 2009 that said conditions that ""require ongoing treatment for a mental health diagnosis"" are sufficient for excused absences, and that a written note from a physician or mental health professional may be required to approve the absence. ""I hope this gets out there and schools start to think about it,"" Ms. Rothman said of the trend. ""I hope it continues to spread.""","An expert called the laws in both Utah and Oregon a ""win"" and said students who are ""quietly suffering"" from mental illness will benefit most.",e86e65ba-ab15-55a1-8018-1799e9025c69,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/education/22xp-mentalhealth/22xp-mentalhealth-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=0c9a366195333ca4d2c8d72228ab1b9ca9abd03818367e3864b3d84269cfe07c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Students in a classroom discussion about consent and healthy relationships at Central Catholic High School in Portland, Ore.",e86e65ba-ab15-55a1-8018-1799e9025c69,N24News/imgs/e86e65ba-ab15-55a1-8018-1799e9025c69.jpg,1
Style,Black Germans Say It's Time to Look Inward,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/style/black-germans-say-its-time-to-look-inward.html,"BERLIN -- In June, when Jelisa Delfeld joined a Telegram channel to help organize a silent demonstration against racism in Stuttgart, Germany, she was one of fewer than two dozen members. The next day, that number grew to 100, and the following, about 1,000 people had joined the channel where the protest was being planned. ""When the video of George Floyd being killed came out, it was also shocking in Germany,"" said Ms. Delfeld, 24. ""Even though it happened in the U.S., it's a Black man, and we're Black. If there's pain in our community, you can feel that pain everywhere."" Over five days of Zoom meetings, calls and texts, this group of young strangers, most of whom had little experience in activism, organized a demonstration that brought between 7,000 and 10,000 people into the streets of Stuttgart, a city of roughly 620,000, on June 6.

Despite the overwhelming public show of solidarity in June and July, many activists in Germany said that Germans seemed more eager to support Americans than to look inward. In the last few years, Germany has been criticized by the United Nations and the European Union for racial profiling and police violence. And while the country is known worldwide for its ""culture of remembrance"" around the Holocaust, German textbooks and mainstream history narratives largely ignore its colonial history. Many Black people in Germany say that they do not feel a sense of belonging, and that their presence here has been rendered practically invisible. ""The assumption is that if you're Black, you are not, nor will you ever be, German,"" said Angelo Camufingo, 28, one of the organizers of the group Black Lives Matter Berlin. Part of it, many Black Germans say, has to do with a culture of denial around racial discrimination. ""There was solidarity with the protesters,"" said Julia Wissert, 36, the artistic director of the Dortmund Theater in western Germany, who, with a lawyer, developed an anti-racism clause for theater contracts in 2018. ""At the same time, there is the imagined idea of racism being an American problem because America always had issues with racism due to slavery.""

Ms. Wissert described racism in Germany as a mist. ""You can't really see it if you stand in it, but you experience it if you stand in it because it makes you hyper-visible and invisible at the same time,"" she said. Though Germany doesn't maintain data on racial demographics because of the atrocities of the Nazi era, it does document where migrants arrive from. By that count, about one million of the country's residents have roots in Africa, though the actual number is likely higher. Organizations that research Germany's colonial history have traced the presence of people from the African continent as far back as the early 1700s. ""Black communities in Germany are so diverse,"" said Siraad Wiedenroth, 33, who sits on the board of the Initiative for Black People in Germany, in a phone interview. ""There are Black people here in the second, third and fourth generations. There are people who arrived 10 years ago via guest worker visas or to study, Black people here who sought refuge."" Artists have worked to bring visibility to Germany's nonwhite populations. Last year, working together with local youth, Ms. Wissert created a play in Bochum called ""2069: The End of Others."" Experiences with racism came up repeatedly through stories her teenage collaborators told about their lives. ""They know something is wrong, that they're being treated differently,"" she said. Rhea Ramjohn, 36, one of the founders of Black Brown Berlin, a digital platform that connects Black and brown people, said: ""The history of Black people in Europe and Germany is often a narrative that they were never here. We were never here. We just arrived here. We are all refugees."" The platform showcases Black-owned businesses and produces anti-discrimination events. One of its projects is a series of portraits of Black and brown people along with their interpretation of the phrase ""We Are Here.""

This summer, cultural institutions reached out to Black artists to commission work in response to the global unrest. Black Brown Berlin was approached in July by Haus der Kulturen der Welt, a prominent museum in the capital, to produce a piece for a digital series on racism during the pandemic. The result was a short film that pairs a spoken-word poem with visuals of dancers performing spontaneous movement in the Grunewald forest in Berlin, where Audre Lorde would walk with mentees and friends, including the activist May Ayim, during the years Ms. Lorde lived in Berlin. The poem includes references to the ""mothers of the movement,"" those whose Black children were killed by police, and ""I can't breathe,"" a phrase that has taken on sharper significance during the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected people of color. Femi Oyewole, 31, one of Black Brown Berlin's founders, said that many of Germany's demonstrations suggested that racism was ""an American issue. Like, 'Germany's fine, we don't have this issue.' But people here were tired. What about people here in Germany who suffered at the hands of the police?"" ""When I was growing up and thinking about being Black, it was so shaped by the U.S.,"" said Ciani-Sophia Hoeder, 30, a founder of RosaMag, an online lifestyle magazine for Black women in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. ""Anti-Black racism was always something people thought the U.S. or U.K. or France have, but not Germany,"" Ms. Hoeder said. ""We don't talk about police brutality.""

Some monitoring bodies have been trying to change that. In 2017, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent reported that while the German constitution guarantees equality and prohibits race-based discrimination, ""it is not being enforced."" The report also said that the lives of people of African descent ""are marked by racism, negative stereotypes and structural racism"" as well as ""racist violence and hate crimes."" The report lists several examples of racial discrimination and violence that were not properly investigated, including the death of Oury Jalloh, an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone who burned to death while tied to a bed in police custody in Dessau in 2005. Since 2005, a group of friends and family has uncovered various inconsistencies in the police's version of events surrounding his death. For example, Mr. Jalloh did not have a lighter with him when he was admitted, but one was found later in the fire rubble bag. An independent examination of Mr. Jalloh noted that he had fractures all over his body. The mattress he was tied to was fire resistant. In 2018, the state parliament in Saxony-Anhalt tasked two investigators with re-examining the details of Mr. Jalloh's death. This summer, Der Spiegel reported on the resistance the investigators have run into. The report from the U.N. also described racial profiling in Germany as ""endemic."" A report from the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance last year emphasized that in Germany, ""though there is strong evidence for extensive racial profiling, numerous police services and representatives are unaware of or do not admit its existence.""

""We have no racism problem in the police here,"" Thomas Blenke, the interior minister for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg said in a news release. Some politicians say that racial profiling does not exist in Germany because discrimination is banned by the constitution. But rules of police conduct allow police officers to stop and search people without suspicion in trains or in train stations all over the country or in ""criminal hot spots."" According to Die Zeit, Horst Seehofer, the minister of the interior, canceled a planned study into racial profiling because there is ""no need"" for it. (A spokesperson for the minister said that he commissioned a study on ""right-wing extremism in security authorities"" that will be completed this month.) Mr. Seehofer recently criticized a new law in Berlin that allows people who have been discriminated against by representatives of ""the state,"" such as police officers, teachers and judges, to seek damages and compensation, calling it ""basically madness,"" in an interview with the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. He added that ""there is no justification for questioning the integrity of our police officers in such a structural way."" This summer, Mr. Seehofer, who is on a new government committee against right-wing extremism and racism, threatened to file a criminal complaint against Hengameh Yaghoobifarah, 28, a journalist who had written a satirical column that criticized the police after the peak of the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and abroad. Two German police unions filed lawsuits against Mx. Yaghoobifarah. After pushback from various sources, including from a petition signed by more than 1,000 people, Mr. Seehofer backtracked. Mx. Yaghoobifarah found out last week that 150 lawsuits that had been filed because of the column were being dropped. Mx. Yaghoobifarah and Fatma Aydemir, 33, the editors of a recent book of essays on racism, spoke about the reluctance in Germany to address the root of the violence against Black people.

""On all the talk shows in which Black Lives Matter was discussed, there was a hesitation to talk about the German police,"" Ms. Aydemir said. ""And whenever a person did that on a popular or mainstream platform, they always invited someone from the police or a politician very close to the police, or three of them even, to destroy this argument."" Mx. Yaghoobifarah said: ""They would, for example, say the police training in Germany is way longer than in the U.S., so people are more skilled here or they would say the history of the prison industrial complex and anti-Black racism in the U.S. is different than in Germany. And of course, it is different, but it doesn't mean that Germany is doing well.""

""Many people in Germany have not thought about anti-Black racism or could afford not to think about it,"" Mr. Kopp said. ""There has been a long history of oppression and repression here, and a struggle for equal rights."" Berlin Postkolonial, another group Mr. Kopp is part of, has been giving similar tours for 15 years. ""In the beginning we did three tours a year,"" Mr. Kopp said. ""Now it's 50."" He said that more and more teachers have been requesting tours for their students. Before, the tour groups mostly consisted of young adults curious about part of history that had been skipped over in school. ""History is a construction,"" Ms. Yeboah said. ""We need to know it to shape our future. It's the only way you can move forward in a better direction.""","The Black Lives Matter movement saw shows of solidarity around the world this summer. In Germany, some feel there is a reluctance to acknowledge more local problems.",e248d34e-82c6-5867-a048-53e5d24037ed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/fashion/02BLM-GERMANY1/02BLM-GERMANY1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b1f2fc1350272c124af776b63c6c5cf0acee82edbcc7141818389a7cb1b312ec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At least 15,000 people gathered to protest racism in Berlin on June 6.

Health,Lots of Successful Women Are Freezing Their Eggs. But It May Not Be About Their Careers.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/03/health/freezing-eggs-women.html,"Lots of Successful Women Are Freezing Their Eggs. But It May Not Be About Their Careers .

""Freeze Your Eggs, Free Your Career,"" announced the headline of a Bloomberg Businessweek cover story in 2014. It was the year that Facebook and then Apple began offering egg freezing as a benefit to employees. Hundreds of think pieces followed, debating the costs and benefits of ""postponing procreation"" in the name of professional advancement. In the years since, many more women across the world have frozen their eggs . Many are highly educated. But the decision may have very little to do with work, at least according to a new study. In interviews with 150 American and Israeli women who had undergone one cycle, career planning came up as the primary factor exactly two times. Instead, most women focused on another reason: they still hadn't found a man to build a family with. ""The stereotype that these ambitious career women are freezing their eggs for the purposes of their career -- that's really inaccurate at the present time,"" said Marcia Inhorn, a medical anthropologist from Yale University, and one of the authors of the study, which was presented Monday at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's conference in Spain.

Most of these mid-to-late 30s women were already established in their careers by the time they got to the clinic, the study found. ""They weren't freezing to advance; they were facing the overarching problem of partnership,"" she said. This was the case, even among those who worked for companies that offered to pay for the procedure. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Though a single woman, headed toward 40, may feel like a freakish anomaly as she freezes her eggs because she hasn't found a partner , she's not. This finding echoes other studies in the United States and Britain that have similarly found that it's the absence of a partner that drives most women to freeze their eggs. The subjects in this particular study, which has not yet been published, came from seven different fertility clinics. In the United States, the women generally lived in cities along the East Coast or in the Bay Area. They ranged in age from 29 to 42, with three-quarters falling between 35 and 39. The research approach taken by Dr. Inhorn and her co-authors Dr. Pasquale Patrizio, director of the Yale Fertility Center, and Daphna Birenbaum-Carmeli of the University of Haifa, involved asking women -- both single and those who had partners -- to share their egg freezing stories and then analyzing their responses to try to understand their primary motives.

Of the participating women, 85 percent were single and most were heterosexual. For about half of these single women, it was uncertainty about when they would meet a man to build a family with that brought them to the clinic, they told the researchers. The next largest group was driven there by a divorce or breakup. (Egg freezing was actually covered by several of these women's divorce settlements.) This was followed by a smaller group of women who were deployed overseas and felt it was wise to freeze their eggs first and then a handful of women who were preparing to have a baby on their own. Career planning was the least common reason. Among the 15 percent of the subjects who were in relationships, the reasons for freezing their eggs were not unlike the single women's: though they had a partner, he was not yet ready or not interested in building a family. Why are so many women having a hard time finding men to have children with? One hypothesis that researchers often cite is that it's related to demographics. Women in many developed countries, including the United States, Canada, Britain, Japan, Norway and Australia, are now more educated than men. This could be creating a dearth of appealing male partners for these women. An American doctor in Dr. Inhorn's study voiced this concern, saying ""Most men don't want relationships,"" and are willing to date uneducated women, whereas most educated women will not. "" So I think I have about a .09 percent chance of meeting someone.""

While a number of her subjects seemed to feel empowered by their decision to freeze their eggs, this sense of frustration was common. ""Why me? Why did I end up this way?"" was a question that came up a lot. Yes, they had focused on their careers -- but they had relationships over the years as well. Neither they, nor their friends, had expected to find themselves without a partner at this stage in their lives. ""It's not something you've done,"" Dr. Inhorn said she found herself wanting to tell them. ""It's you and thousands of other women.""",The decision to head to the fertility clinic for women in a study had more to do with an absence of suitable partners and little to do with getting ahead at work.,a76f7713-eecf-54fb-8160-cb4c7312dcdd,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/10/science/04TB-FREEZE/04TB-FREEZE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=311742427aa90c7f3174125ef861952c28b55972cdda532800a2dc2fbe2d09f2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t freezing to advance,&rdquo; said a scientist involved in a study of 150 women. &ldquo;They were facing the overarching problem of partnership.&rdquo;",a76f7713-eecf-54fb-8160-cb4c7312dcdd,N24News/imgs/a76f7713-eecf-54fb-8160-cb4c7312dcdd.jpg,1
Your Money,Treasury Wants to End Tax Deal for Some Family-Owned Businesses,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/20/your-money/treasury-wants-to-end-tax-deal-for-some-family-owned-businesses.html,"The Treasury Department has moved a step closer to tightening the way family limited partnerships are valued for tax purposes. And the prospect that the tax code could be changed by the end of this year has tax planners pushing their clients to consider stepping up estate and business planning, or risk paying more taxes. Earlier this month, the Treasury Department issued ""proposed final regulations"" to eliminate a provision in the tax code that effectively allows wealthy people to greatly discount the value of shares in a family limited partnership given to family members. These partnerships are able to own assets like family business, real estate and securities. The discount, which has been allowed since the 1990s, is granted for what is considered a lack of marketability for minority shares in these partnerships. If a family member, for example, wanted to sell his or her share in a partnership that was entirely owned by other family members, the pool of buyers might well be limited to his or her relatives. They might not have the money -- or desire -- to buy him out. This provision, contained in section 2704 of the Internal Revenue Code, has been abused by aggressive tax planners and lawyers who used the discount, sometimes as high as 40 percent, and applied it to partnerships that contained marketable securities or other assets that could otherwise be easily valued and sold.

The Internal Revenue Service has repeatedly balked at stocks and bonds being discounted just because they were owned in a family partnership. On Dec. 1, it will hold a hearing on the new regulations, which would strip away the discount from all family limited partnerships regardless of what they hold. And this is one of the sticking points for planners. Many argue that partnerships that hold businesses should still be entitled to the discounts. ""There have been abuses in the past, like when families took a $100 million of marketable securities and wrapped them in a family limited partnership wrapper and took a discount,"" said Christopher Pegg, regional wealth planning manager for Southern California at Wells Fargo Private Bank. ""But what happens if it's a $100 million corrugated steel company and the family owns it and Mom dies with a 20 percent stake?"" he added. ""The new regulations say that stake is worth $20 million. That's not what it's worth."" Mr. Pegg pointed out that if nonfamily members owned the same private company, the I.R.S. would allow a discount for the very same lack of marketability.

""We cannot assume that one family acts together,"" he said. ""It's worse in many cases being in with family than with strangers."" Tax experts do not rule out that these new regulations, although labeled final, could be changed in the comment period. Their enactment, which is set for 30 days after they become final, could also be delayed. At the earliest they would take effect on Dec. 31. Still, predicting when the regulations will take effect is beyond people's control and could be risky for those who would benefit from a family partnership. ""There is no mulligan,"" said Mark Parthemer, senior fiduciary counsel at Bessemer Trust. ""If a family is considering doing some tax planning and they're putting it off to next year, they can't go back in time and take advantage of the discounts."" Some planners are drawing parallels to the fourth quarter of 2012, when wealthy people scrambled to make gifts under what was then a $5.12 million exemption for individuals. The rush was generated by the fear that the Obama administration would abolish or greatly reduce the exemption in 2013. Instead, the government kept it in place, with an annual increase for inflation. For the very wealthy, there is good reason to set up a family limited partnership by the end of the year. The discounting, for example, can turn a $10 million gift into $6.5 million for tax purposes. If the proposed changes go into effect as planned, they will certainly have an effect on certain very wealthy families. ""We're telling clients to move quickly,"" Mr. Pegg said. He said that it typically takes six months to set up a family limited partnership, but if families were motivated and focused on this they could set one up in about 45 days.

But even if discounting goes away, the ability to save on tax, protect assets from creditors and pass any future appreciation on to the next generation still exists through tax planning. ""Valuation discounts have always been the icing on the cake for these tax transfers that we do,"" said Scott Goldberger, estate and trust principal at the accounting firm Kaufman Rossin in Boca Raton, Fla. ""If the primary goal is to push future appreciation of the business onto family members, thereby reducing the value of the taxable estate, the discount gives you a head start."" Apart from the discount, there are two effective strategies to move money or business interests to heirs. The first is simply getting assets that are going to appreciate out of a person's estate. If the gift is over the exemption amount, the person may have to pay gift tax. But after that, all future appreciation will grow outside of his or her estate. The second is to put those assets into what is called a grantor trust, which benefits future recipients by allowing the person making the gift to pay all the income taxes in the trust. ""Those two in tandem will typically outweigh the tax savings you'd get from a discount,"" Mr. Goldberger said. ""Even after these regulations are finalized, we think we'll still be seeing a lot of our clients doing this type of planning.""","This provision has been abused by aggressive tax planners and lawyers who used it for family limited partnerships, sometimes as high as 40 percent.",e9449500-efd2-56df-b35a-f4f47a29f575,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/19/business/20WEALTH/20WEALTH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=84fcd6bac47435809e47471426ef7f566ca7905ffe37df40c9eab03a5c6eb02d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A home in the affluent Bel Air neighborhood of Los Angeles.

Movies,New York City's Public Libraries to End Film Streaming Through Kanopy,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/24/movies/new-york-citys-libraries-drop-kanopy-streaming.html,"Public library cardholders in New York City will no longer have access to tens of thousands of movies through Kanopy as of July 1, when the New York, Brooklyn and Queens public libraries end their partnerships with the streaming service because of the cost, the libraries said Monday.

The San Francisco-based platform , which notified library cardholders by email on Monday, offers well-known feature films, like ""Lady Bird"" and ""Moonlight,"" as well as classic movies, documentaries and foreign-language films not always available on other services.

In a statement, the New York Public Library said, ""We believe the cost of Kanopy makes it unsustainable,"" adding that it would use its resources to purchase ""more in-demand collections such as books and e-books."" The Brooklyn and Queens libraries also cited what they said were Kanopy's rising costs in dropping the service.

Global Business,Faltering Economy in China Dims Job Prospects for Graduates,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/business/global/faltering-economy-in-china-dims-job-prospects-for-graduates.html,"HONG KONG -- A record seven million students will graduate from universities and colleges across China in the coming weeks, but their job prospects appear bleak -- the latest sign of a troubled Chinese economy. Businesses say they are swamped with job applications but have few positions to offer as economic growth has begun to falter. Twitter-like microblogging sites in China are full of laments from graduates with dim prospects. The Chinese government is worried, saying that the problem could affect social stability, and it has ordered schools, government agencies and state-owned enterprises to hire more graduates at least temporarily to help relieve joblessness. ""The only thing that worries them more than an unemployed low-skilled person is an unemployed educated person,"" said Shang-Jin Wei, a Columbia Business School economist. Lu Mai, the secretary general of the elite, government-backed China Development Research Foundation, acknowledged in a speech this month that less than half of this year's graduates had found jobs so far.

Graduating seniors at all but a few of China's top universities say that very few people they know are finding jobs -- and that those who did receive offers over the winter were seeing them rescinded as the economy has weakened in recent weeks. ""Many companies are not expanding at all, while some of my classmates have been hired and fired in the same month when the companies realized that they could not afford the salaries after all,"" said Yan Shuang, a graduating senior in labor and human resources at the Beijing Institute of Technology. Ms. Yan said she had been promised a job at a sports clothing company over the winter. But the company canceled all hiring plans in March as the economy weakened.

China quadrupled the number of students enrolled in universities and colleges over the last decade. But its economy is still driven by manufacturing, with a preponderance of blue-collar jobs. Prime Minister Li Keqiang personally led the cabinet meeting, on May 16, that produced the directive for schools, government agencies and state-owned enterprises to hire more graduates, a strategy that has been used with increasing frequency in recent years to absorb jobless but educated youths.

""Any country with an expanding middle class and a rising number of unemployed graduates is in for trouble,"" said Gerard A. Postiglione, the director of the Wah Ching Center of Research on Education in China at Hong Kong University. A national survey released last winter found that in the age bracket of 21- to 25-year-olds, 16 percent of the men and women with college degrees were unemployed.
* The high cost of gas is forcing families to cut back on activities and essentials.
* Clearview AI does well in another round of facial recognition accuracy tests.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. But only 4 percent of those with an elementary school education were unemployed, a sign of voracious corporate demand persisting for blue-collar workers. Wages for workers who have come in from rural areas to urban factories have surged 70 percent in the last four years; wages for young people in white-collar sectors have barely stayed steady or have even declined. Economists have long estimated that the Chinese economy needs to grow 7 or 8 percent annually to avoid large-scale unemployment. But that rule of thumb has become less reliable in recent years as the labor market has split. Relatively slow growth is still creating enough jobs to provide full employment for the country's blue-collar workers. But much faster growth may be needed to create white-collar jobs for the graduates pouring out of universities. The International Monetary Fund predicts the Chinese economy will grow 7.75 percent this year -- slower than the growth of 10 to 14 percent before 2008, but still a much faster pace than in the West. The main problem for China lies in the sheer growth in graduates; the United States produces three million graduates a year, while China has increased its annual number of graduates by more than five million in a single decade.

One response, endorsed by the State Council, is to urge more graduates to take jobs at small, private companies. But a generation of people who grew up under the government's ""one child"" policy has proved risk-averse and slow to join or set up new companies. ""I would not work for private companies, that is not secure -- only state-owned ones,"" Ms. Yan said. Many graduating seniors, seeing limited job opportunities, are applying to the country's fast-expanding graduate schools. Yang Yi, a senior majoring in applied economics at the Beijing Institute of Technology, said that after applying unsuccessfully for jobs through the winter, he was prepared to seek a master's degree. ""Hopefully the economy will have recovered when I graduate in two years,"" he said. ""Getting a master's degree is always better than working in small companies that might not even last long."" Chinese students have been gravitating toward majors that are perceived as academically less demanding but likely to lead to careers in banking. Business administration and economics majors have proliferated, partly because the country's many new private universities find them inexpensive subjects to teach. Programs in engineering and other sciences, with their requirements for costly labs, have grown more slowly. As in the West in recent years, financial services is an extremely popular field among college graduates, who besiege banks, brokerage firms and other businesses in the sector with job applications. Ministry of Human Resources statistics show that average pay for banking sector employees, at $14,500 a year, is twice the level of pay in sectors like health care and education. Graduates from the best universities still have a strong chance of finding a job, particularly if they do not set their sights too high. Lin Yinbi, a senior graduating in trade and economics from the prestigious Renmin University in Beijing, said that he had job offers from a heating company and a supermarket chain, but was still applying for a well-paid bank job. ""The question is, What kind of job is it?"" he said. ""Does it align with our major? Does it pay enough? Do we have room to grow?""","Graduating seniors say that few are finding jobs, and that some offers extended over the winter are being rescinded, as the Chinese economy falters.",64b602d2-21a4-56ad-8820-94471feae970,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/06/17/world/asia/17chinagrad/17chinagrad-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=b82f85fd3ddbae226cc6f25c9b6b72c7995b601d9069877e5c74272155d64998&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A job fair last month at Minzu University of China in Beijing.

Technology,Snap Makes a Bet on the Cultural Supremacy of the Camera,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/08/technology/snap-makes-a-bet-on-the-cultural-supremacy-of-the-camera.html,"If you're watching Snap's stock ticker, stop. The company that makes Snapchat, the popular photo-messaging app, has been having a volatile few days after its rocket-fueled initial public offering last week. But Snap's success or failure isn't going to be determined this week or even this year. This is a company that's betting on a long-term trend: the rise and eventual global dominance of visual culture. Snap calls itself a camera company. That's a bit cute, considering that it only just released an actual camera, the Spectacles sunglasses, late last year. Snap will probably build other kinds of cameras, including potentially a drone. But it's best to take Snap's camera company claim seriously, not literally. Snap does not necessarily mean that its primary business will be selling a bunch of camera hardware. It's not going to turn into Nikon, Polaroid or GoPro. Instead it's hit on something deeper and more important. Through both its hardware and software, Snap wants to enable the cultural supremacy of the camera, to make it at least as important to our daily lives as the keyboard.

Since even before the invention of the printing press, text has been the central way that humans communicate over long distances and across time. Computers only entrenched the primacy of text. The rise of desktop publishing in the 1980s turned all of us into composers of beautiful, printed documents. Then the internet turned us into distributors of digital words. Suddenly we were all bloggers, emailers, tweeters and authors of Mediums and status updates. We ditched phone calls for written messages. We called these messages what they were: texts, as if we were describing the histories of ancients. But then came the cellphone camera, and then, a decade ago, the smartphone. For the first time, it became possible for humans to instantly document their visual surroundings and to transmit what we saw with lifelike fidelity. At first this seemed like a small change: We'd have more pictures of our families. A host of companies, from Facebook to Flickr to Instagram, latched on to this idea. But Snapchat uncovered something deeper about the camera. Not only could we use pictures to document the world, but we could also use them to communicate. Snapchat, which was at first dismissed as a mere sexting app, showed that with the right design, a phone's camera could add an extra dimension to communication that you couldn't get with text alone.

That may be only a start. The growing importance of cameras -- of images rather than just text -- is altering much about culture. It's transforming many people's personal relationships. It's changing the kind of art and entertainment we produce. You might even credit cameras -- or blame them -- for our more emotional, and less rational, politics. Perhaps most consequential, the rising dependence on cameras is changing our language. Other than in face-to-face communication, we used to talk primarily in words. Now, more and more, from GIFs to emoji, selfies to image-macro memes and live video, we talk in pictures. How does this change culture? In a paper published last year, Oren Soffer, a professor of communications at the Open University of Israel, argued that Snapchat returns us to a time before the printing press, when information was disseminated orally instead of through writing. Snapchat has two defining features: pictures and ephemerality. When you talk to others on the service, you usually send them a photo, often of your face. The photo lasts for a few seconds before disappearing. Paradoxically, Professor Soffer said, these features make Snapchat much more like talking than writing. ""What Snapchat is attempting is to apply technology to visual products to create a fading-away effect -- just as spoken words fade away in the air after utterance,"" he wrote. Snapchat adds other features to deepen this effect. The lenses and filters -- ways to make your face look like a dog, for instance -- seem juvenile to people who aren't used to Snapchat. But the moment you pick it up you understand the effect; lenses don't just add whimsy to your speech, but can perform other functions that approximate face-to-face chatting, too. They can hide your face when you're not looking your best. They can provide emotional cues: rainbow vomit may mean you're feeling great, while a black-and-white filter may suggest melancholy. Yes, Snapchat lets you add text on top of these images, but the pictures are a kind of language by themselves. Gretchen McCulloch, a linguist who is writing a book about how the internet is changing language, said Snapchat lenses and filters were a form of what linguists call ""phatic communication,"" which is communication that is meant to ease social interactions instead of to convey information. (For example, saying ""hello"" and ""you're welcome."")

""That's the purpose of the face filters or the geofilters in Snapchat -- they provide a fun way to communicate these same kinds of phatic messages with pictures,"" Ms. McCulloch said. The other purpose the filters serve is to create a shared context for communication. When you talk to people in real life, you often do so while engaged in some other activity -- you go out to dinner, you take a walk, you play a board game. ""In digital environments, what you talk about is Snapchat's filters, or sticker collections, or you talk about an interesting GIF,"" Ms. McCulloch said. ""They're a shared object to talk about."" None of this is to suggest writing is going to go away. On the internet, new forms of communication tend to be additive. We won't replace text with pictures; we add them together to create something new. What's more, text is still irreplaceable in lots of forms of communication. I could have tried to tell you this story in the form of an image-based Snapchat story, but it would most likely have been unwieldy and not especially informative. If you want to convey a lot of information concisely and accurately, writing is still one of the best methods to use. ""If you've ever looked at Ikea instructions, those don't have any words in them, and they're notorious for how frustrating they are to use,"" Ms. McCulloch said. ""Ikea instructions would be a lot nicer if they came with words. So I don't think words are going anywhere."" But even if words won't be replaced by pictures, the rising prominence of picture-based communications systems could still alter society in big ways. Joe Weisenthal of Bloomberg argued in a short essay last year that the raucous 2016 presidential election stemmed in part from what he called our ""post-literate"" age. In the ancient era of oral communication, the messages that proved most memorable were short and emotionally resonant. Mr. Weisenthal argued that the clipped, image-heavy syntax of social platforms bore a resemblance to that paradigm. ""Complicated, nuanced thoughts that require context don't play very well on most social platforms, but a resonant hashtag can have extraordinary influence,"" he wrote.","Our rising dependence on cameras is changing our language, and the company behind Snapchat is counting on the eventual dominance of visual culture.",14bfc7c9-05d6-556b-a249-264086a145e4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/03/09/technology/09state-illo/09state-illo-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=536&w=1024&s=f7b4caa8d5159ba2239932d5cb117e21442e13ec9884610b80b2b9b9ae30d517&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The rising dependence on cameras is changing the way we communicate.,14bfc7c9-05d6-556b-a249-264086a145e4,N24News/imgs/14bfc7c9-05d6-556b-a249-264086a145e4.jpg,20
Your Money,New Rules to Eliminate Frustrating Financial Aid Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/23/your-money/new-fafsa-rules-to-eliminate-frustrating-financial-aid-problem.html,"Although filing the form in early January is ideal, not all families are ready to do so. The form requires filers to use information from their federal income tax return from the calendar year that just ended -- so, January filers would use information from 2015. But most people will not receive their W-2 forms and other information necessary to file a 2015 tax return until later in January, at the earliest.

This is the last year filers will face this situation. Starting in 2016, changes to Fafsa rules will eliminate this frustrating timing problem. The form for the 2017-18 academic year can be filed as early as Oct. 1, 2016, and will rely on income tax information from the previous tax year (or, in financial aid lingo, ""prior-prior"" year tax information). So next year, students will file two Fafsas -- each using 2015 tax information.

In the meantime, families who want to file in early January 2016, before they have filed their 2015 income tax return, can complete the Fafsa with estimated financial data. That will get their application in the system, and they can update it, if needed, when they actually file their return, ""without losing your place in line,"" said Martha Holler, a spokeswoman for Sallie Mae.

Filing estimated financial information and updating it later may raise the chances of your application being flagged for verification, Ms. Asher said. That means you may be required to submit extra documents before your financial aid package is completed. But estimating is the best option, she said, if you might risk missing an early state deadline by waiting.

Here are some questions and answers about filing the Fafsa:

Q. Do I have to file the Fafsa online?

A. It is not required, but most filers do and there are benefits to doing so, Ms. Asher said. If you have already filed your income taxes, for instance, you can use the Internal Revenue Service's Data Retrieval Tool to automatically transfer tax data into your Fafsa form.","The Free Application for Federal Student Aid for the 2017-18 school year can now be filed as early as Oct. 1, 2016 using 2015 tax data.",1af915a9-0cbc-5ba4-a1b4-7f11621fee8b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/12/26/business/26ADVISER/26ADVISER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=83c487f7b6bd88dd771c34e3fca870ff9dd55b51f7fb45ba43dfa02035fbc0e7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Graduating seniors at James Madison University in May.

Travel,Using Dance to Connect With Locals,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/14/travel/using-dance-to-connect-with-locals.html,"On a trip to Austria in 2013, I took a drop-in waltz class at the Rueff Dance School in downtown Vienna. I only paid for an hour, so I was limited to the basic steps, but even so, it was thrilling after just 15 minutes to actually be twirling around the floor in the arms of an Austrian for whom this dance was second nature, my instructor, Henry Karesh. Like many Viennese, Mr. Karesh has been waltzing since childhood and knows all the variations that turn a simple three-step into something a lot more sophisticated, none of which I did that day. But as he gently steered me around the polished wood floor in the dance studio, I was reminded that more than any other travel activity, dance connects visitor to local in a language that needs no words.

""Dancing with people breaks down barriers, and it doesn't happen in another way,"" said Mickela Mallozzi, a dance tour director who is also the host of the web and television series ""Bare Feet."" ""You make a connection physically. It is intimate, in an appropriate way."" One of my very first overseas trips was to Crete with my husband, Jim. Moments after stepping off the ferry, we were invited to a party, and spent our first night in Heraklion with 50 dinner companions with whom we could not converse. At first it was a little uncomfortable, but after the plates were cleared the fun began. We were pulled into a giant spinning circle of locked arms, where we kicked and pivoted and laughed. I never exchanged more than the simplest phrases with any of the Cretans I partied with that night, but it is one of my favorite travel memories. Eager for more encounters like those in Crete and Vienna, in the past year I traveled to three countries with a plan to learn local dances in even the most cursory way so that I might again make the kind of connection Ms. Mallozzi was talking about. Any expectation I had about how easy it would be to shimmy like the Indian actress Freida Pinto in the closing scene of the Oscar-winning 2008 film ""Slumdog Millionaire"" vanished within 10 minutes of the warm-up at the Shakti School of Dance in Pushkar, India.

Colleena Shakti, 34, an American expat from Ventura, Calif., dabbled in Middle Eastern folk and belly dancing before beginning serious study of Odissi, one of the oldest forms of classical Indian dancing. It was the colorful, joyful Bollywood movies that brought me to Ms. Shakti's school thinking that I would learn those comely shoulder shrugs and graceful hand gestures that were synonymous with contemporary dance in Indian cinema. ""Everybody in the world loves Bollywood dance,"" Ms. Shakti said, because it is beautiful and fun. Some Bollywood movements have their origins in Odissi, she said, but the similarity stops there because classical Indian dances are ancient, subtle and complex. ""If people saw Odissi before they saw Bollywood, they would never think, 'I could do that,' "" she said, appearing not to judge me for having thought exactly that. Ms. Shakti has been practicing Odissi for 15 years. It cannot be learned in a few days and it does involve serious effort and pain. The shortest class offered here is one month. (The cost for that is $700.) Students from around the world come, some year after year, to study with Ms. Shakti. Elina Kiaili, formerly a ballet dancer in Greece, had already explored belly dancing in Turkey and tango, salsa and ballroom dancing at home in Greece. In 2010, while taking an Indian folk dance class in Pushkar, she saw Ms. Shakti perform for the first time. The performance spoke to her, she said: ""I saw Odissi dance, and I said, 'This is it.' My heart was stolen."" Music for each three-hour session is performed on a drum called the Odissi Mardala by Sudhansu Pohana, another instructor and a classical performer himself. The lesson begins with 90 minutes of the most grueling yoga I have ever tried -- and that's before the actual heavy leg lifting and feather-light arm movements begin. Only the elaborate hand gestures and facial expressions seemed achievable, except for the fact that there are thousands of them -- so many that a thick encyclopedia explaining the meaning of each is available for reference in a corner of the room.

""There's an awareness when you use your hands in the dance, everything right up to fingertips has to be awake and alive,"" said Katie Getchell, a 50-year-old student from Colorado. Ms. Shakti's students are required to learn how to tie a sari, which they must wear on their way to and from class, during their lessons and at Ms. Shakti's evening lectures on the history of the dance and the deities depicted in it. On the roof of the Vishnu temple that houses the studio, I took a break with Sarah Otto-Combs, 33, from Seattle. This was her second visit, but the first since Ms. Shakti instituted the sari rule in 2014. Learning to put it on was hard, Ms. Otto-Combs told me, though she said it was worth the effort because it helped her relate to local residents. ""The women really open up to you and connect with you in a different way because they see that you are coming to respect their culture, not just to look at it,"" she said. After the break, I made a few more clumsy attempts to join the class, splaying my bare feet in the ballet first position, and stomping as instructed until the pain in my feet and knees got the better of me. The takeaway for me was realizing that even without conquering the steps, I had accomplished one of the goals Ms. Shakti sets for her students: I'd had ""an experience in the culture."" Before Erin Hummert's wedding last summer, a group of her friends arranged a bachelorette party. They briefly considered taking Ms. Hummert, a 39-year-old doctor, bowling. But then the group of American and European expatriates now living in Addis Ababa had another idea: How about a dance class?

Earlier in the day, I attended a drop-in class the two men offer on Saturday mornings at Galani Coffee Warehouse, a restaurant, art gallery and performance space. When I heard that their next appointment was teaching at the dance party for the bride, I asked to tag along. We arrived at an outdoor pavilion on the grounds of the British Embassy, and I watched while Mr. Sendi and Mr. Demissie patiently demonstrated some of the most popular movements among the many dances performed across the country. Within minutes all the guests were shifting their weight from side to side, making great heaving lunges with their legs while pumping their shoulders up and down to the beat of a drum. ""It's not just traditional dance,"" Dr. Hummert told me. The steps are ""part of modern dancing that young people do. Out at bars our friends try to get us to do the different moves."" We drove from the party to our next stop, a show by disabled dancers in the Meskel Square neighborhood. On the way, Mr. Demissie told me there are more than 80 varieties of Ethiopian traditional dancing. ""All the north people, they dance with the head, the neck or the shoulder, and when you come south they use their hips, their legs. Further down they jump, so they use their feet,"" he said.

Mr. Sendi, 31, and Mr. Demissie, 33, are childhood friends and partners in the Destino Dance Company, which has a goal of increasing Ethiopian appreciation for modern dance by creatively reinterpreting traditional steps. The men offer the Saturday 90-minute morning classes for expats and locals that I attended (about $6 per class) and a separate basic-steps session for children. There were about 20 other adults taking lessons with me that morning, and we did floor-based moves I associated with contemporary dance and fewer of the jumps and swaying action of tribal dance. Those were reserved for the bachelorette party, where we did it all, including Ethiopia's trademark up and down shoulder shakes and enough neck extensions to make my muscles burn. My class in India showed me that dance could be worship. In Ethiopia, I learned some of the many modern and traditional moves in the dances of that country. Now, I was as ready as I could be for New Zealand's haka, dance that is often intended to intimidate spectators with its fierce movements. ""To scare the enemy away you had to portray yourself as an evil person,"" said Terehira Mokena, a member of New Zealand's native Maoris and a professional dancer at the village of Whakarewarewa in Rotorua, a historic center of Maori culture. On my first visit to New Zealand, in 2012, I attended the Matariki festival, a national competition in which many tribes perform. I watched in fascination as team after team did its best to frighten the audience. So when I went back last summer, I was hoping to at least learn the basics, not just of haka, but also the less well-known poi, a way of swinging balls in complex circles on strings of various lengths.

While only women use the poi in performances, both Maori men and women learn from childhood how to control the lightweight balls because poi is thought to be good for coordination and flexibility. I could not find a teacher before I left home, but was optimistic about finding one upon arrival. I had arranged to stay with a Maori family, and when I entered the house, I discovered my hostess, Heni Herwini, had a traditional dress with an embroidered top on display in her living room, revealing that she had once been a dancer. I considered that a lucky break, but she confessed it had been years and that she could not teach me. Instead, she directed me to Whakarewarewa, occupied by Maoris for the last 700 years and only a few miles from her home. For an entry fee, tourists are welcome to visit the village. At the small community hall there are dance performances twice a day. When I was there, the men in the audience were invited to the stage for an impromptu haka class. To much good-natured screaming and dramatic gesturing, 20-year-old Matt Paterson of Australia squatted with the other tourists with his hands on his hips, a broad smile contradicting the intentions of the dance. ""Haka was used as an act of defiance,"" Ms. Mokena, who leads the dance troupe, told me. ""You had to be defiant. Your whole body, eyes and tongue are used just to frighten them."" By that standard the grinning men signaled the lesson was a complete failure, though they seemed to be having a good time. Unfortunately for me, on the day I visited, women were not called from the audience to give it a try. So I would have left New Zealand having once again seen, but failed to learn, even the first step of either haka or poi if it had not been for the offer of a clerk in the Whakarewarewa Thermal Village souvenir shop. I suspect that Tatiana Te Kowhai, who was working the cash register, determined that she could sell more poi balls if she taught tourists how to use them, because she offered to give me a lesson.

It took considerable concentration for me to keep the balls at just the right speed without having them smack into each other or fly off into space. My clumsy attempts looked nothing like the delicate representation of the flight of birds and butterflies that punctuate the stories of nature and tribal life told in the Maori dances. Even so, I bought the balls, though I haven't picked them up since that afternoon. I prefer to believe, as Ms. Mokena had suggested, that Maori dancing is best left for the descendants of New Zealand's first settlers to perform and for visitors like me to observe and enjoy.",Learning local dances is a way of experiencing the culture in a direct (and fun) way — in a language that needs no words.,e71ac070-70d8-58d2-a94d-38c283800095,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/14/travel/14PERSONAL1/14PERSONAL1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=57c78cff4d44f7c106e3bfcc9a991b1895837a58d4a1e72c7b98c78663cdefaf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Colleena Shakti, center, in the purple sari, teaches Odissi, one of the oldest forms of classical Indian dancing, at the Shakti School of Dance in Pushkar, India.",e71ac070-70d8-58d2-a94d-38c283800095,N24News/imgs/e71ac070-70d8-58d2-a94d-38c283800095.jpg,4
Music,12 Essential Lesser-Known Power-Pop Songs,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/arts/music/power-pop-songs.html,"It was the summer of 1979, and parts of the world were in a state of near-surrender: In Britain, millions were reeling from the infamous ""Winter of Discontent,"" in which freezing temperatures and hot-tempered labor strikes left many people jobless, and some London streets buried in trash. Anxious Americans were fuming over the country's second oil shortage in less than a decade, eventually prompting President Jimmy Carter to declare a nationwide ""crisis of confidence."" But in record stores, there was a fast-acting antidote to this ongoing malaise: The eternally youthful, perpetually tuneful genre known as power pop, which by 1979 was dominating vinyl bins and ""American Bandstand."" That year alone would see seminal new releases from Cheap Trick, the Beat, the Knack and Shoes -- bands that merged commanding power chords with sticky, Beatles-obliged melodies. They were among the biggest names in a movement that lasted from the late 1970s through the early 1980s, in which hundreds of bands released irresistible, radio-ready singles brimming with contagious choruses, shame-free (and sometimes shameless) over-harmonizing and no shortage of love-struck longing. Of course, most of the best power-pop numbers never made it to the airwaves: The genre wasn't as credible as punk, or as cool as new wave. And some of its finest practitioners were regional bands who -- whether thanks to snobbery or geography -- couldn't win over tastemakers in London or Los Angeles. Yet over the last few decades, great care has been taken in honoring these shoulda-been stars, whose work has been preserved in overstuffed compilations and Spotify playlists. Together, they offer a sort of secret Top 40 of lost hits and near-misses.

Among vinyl devotees, the Records will be forever known for the dizzying late-70s single ""Starry Eyes"" -- a modest United States radio hit upon release, and a staple of compilations to this day (and rightfully so). But deep-cuts like ""Girl"" demonstrate the British group's soft powers. Led by the vocalist John Wicks, who died in 2018, the Records always seemed more indebted to studio-trained, throwback pop acts than the more caustic punk of the time. The result was songs like ""Girl,"" which unites charging guitar riffs with the sort of airy, all-hands-on-deck harmonies even the Hollies would have envied.

Like many of their '80s contemporaries, Treble Boys didn't remain in power (or in power pop) for long: After forming in New York City in late 1981, the band was quickly embraced by the CBGB founder Hilly Kristal, even landing a slot on the club's short-lived TV show. Barely two years later, the group was gone -- but not before leaving behind this indelible Boys-meet-girl tale of a doomed dance floor crush. Kicking off with a percolating electro-beat, ""Julie-Anne"" soon gives way to dreamy waves of guitar lines and a sugary, synth-assisted chorus. It's all over before you quite know what hit you, but like so many short-lived flirtations, ""Julie-Anne"" lingers long afterward.

Not long after Lance Loud's famed appearance on ""An American Family"" -- the landmark 1973 reality-TV series in which Loud came out to his family, and to the world -- he moved to New York City and became the frontman for this influential glam-punk-pop outfit. The Mumps' ""Muscleboys"" is a stomping blast of lovestruck wistfulness, bolstered by Loud's Tarzan-like kickoff cry and a jubilant chorus. It's also a rare example of a happily, openly queer anthem in the all-too-hetero domain of power pop -- not to mention a primo workout song in its own right.

With its walloping keyboards, blistering guitars and eerie sci-fi vibe, ""Yellow Pills"" is about as ominous-sounding as power pop gets -- a chronicle of zonked-out bliss with an appropriately amped-up opening verse: ""Everybody's feeling groovy/Everybody's got tight pants on/'Cause everybody feels like they were/Just made by the creator."" Based out of Los Angeles, 20/20 was tipped for mainstream superstardom (""This is gonna be their year,"" Dick Clark declared during the group's 1980 ""American Bandstand"" performance). The band dissolved a few years later, but the legacy of ""Yellow Pills"" would groove on for decades, its name eventually inspiring a beloved power-pop fanzine and compilation series.

The British group the Jags had everything you could have wanted from a late-70s power-pop act: colorful suits, a cool name and a logo that even the Strokes would envy. Thankfully, they also had some equally ace tunes, most notably this taut, semi-menacing rocker about a jilted guy expressing his many frustrations to the voice on the other line. ""Back of My Hand"" arrived just a few years after the Nerves' seminal (and Blondie-covered) ""Hanging on the Telephone,"" and a few years before Tommy Tutone's hit ""867-5309/Jenny"" -- proof that no genre captured the era's many missed connections quite like power pop.

There are unmistakable traces of post-punk in this spiffy, spiky charmer, which features shambling guitars, an unfussy bass line and sparse production. But the frontwoman Helen McCookerybook injects a half-dozen or so hooks in each verse, and the song's delightful chorus -- ""I'd really, really, really like to be friends with you"" -- is essentially a power-pop mantra. Purists can feel free to argue about whether this has enough ""power"" to fit on this list; the rest of us can simply hum ""24 Hours"" all day. The Rubinoos, 'I Never Thought It Would Happen' (1977)

This Connecticut quartet certainly didn't lack moxie: their members carried business cards that read ""THE TWEEDS: ROCK N ROLL ... the way you want it!"" But that kind of confidence is justified by tracks like ""I Need That Record."" You can hear the roots of future alt-rock acts like Sloan in the first 10 seconds of this dynamo number, which is full of hot-rodding riffs and high-energy yelps. It never became a record-store staple itself, but the song would be rediscovered -- along with the Treble Boys' ""Julie-Anne"" -- on the crucial skinny-tie primer ""Buttons: Starter Kit"" from 2012.","You already listen to Cheap Trick, Big Star and the Raspberries.

Opinion,Trump's Best Defense,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/25/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment-defense.html,"In the debate over whether Donald Trump deserves impeachment, a curious partisan reversal has taken place. Trump's opponents are suddenly constitutional originalists, seeking to ground their case for impeachment in 18th-century history and founding-era rhetoric. Meanwhile, his most persuasive defenders are more likely to invoke a kind of living constitutionalism, in which the limited, sporadic way that impeachment has been actually used over the centuries matters more than what the founders contemplated. Thus the House Democrats' brief for impeachment is studded with 18th-century quotes to prove that ""high crimes and misdemeanors"" covers all manner of corrupt uses of official power, easily encompassing Trump's sordid behavior with Ukraine. And legal scholars have rushed to point out that in the English tradition the founders drew upon, the impeachment power was used for what the legal historian Frank O. Bowman III calls ""a striking array of abuses of office,"" not just a few specific crimes. Skeptics of the impeachment push, meanwhile, have pointed to the striking absence of presidential impeachments across the Republic's subsequent history. Did James Madison favor an expansive understanding of the impeachment clause? Maybe so, but as an editor of his papers pointed out in The Washington Post, as president, Madison engaged in a dodgy, Trumpian scheme to use State Department money to buy documents purporting to prove his Federalist opponents were conniving with London; the Federalists cried foul, but there wasn't even the beginning of an impeachment proceeding. [Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]

As with Madison, the anti-impeachment argument goes, so with most presidencies since. Yes, impeachment in theory covers all manner of sins. But though presidents have hardly been shy about pushing the limits of their power, impeachment in practice requires supermajorities and national consensus, which is why only one president in all our history has been pressured into resignation, and none have been removed. In a Times op-ed this week, the Josh Blackman of the South Texas College of Law Houston argued that this narrowing of the impeachment power reflects the difficulty of defining when politicized machinations shade into the abuse of power. Allowing that Trump is particularly crude about it, all presidents conflate their own political self-interest with the national interest -- and so deciding when a president crosses the line and betrays his office is almost always a task best left up to the voters. Both the strengths and limits of Blackman's argument are distilled in one of his historical examples: Lyndon Johnson's appointment of Supreme Court Justice Tom C. Clark's son Ramsey Clark as attorney general, part of a maneuver to induce Clark's resignation so that Johnson could then appoint the first African-American justice and consolidate African-American support. This is a useful example because it's been apparent for a while that Trump doesn't want to be an American Mussolini so much as he wants to be a less legislatively minded L.B.J. -- meaning that his conception of the presidency belongs to the middle of the 20th century, when a casual corruption was more commonplace, and presidents routinely used their powers to spy on political opponents (as L.B.J. did to Barry Goldwater) or undermine them, enable their private appetites (cough, J.F.K.) and cover up their scandals.

How well those norms have held is a matter for debate, but there's a reasonable case that presidents have been constrained by them. Clinton's presidential priapism was less egregious than Kennedy's and he got impeached for it; no modern president has imitated the Kennedy seraglio. The F.B.I.'s misconduct in its investigation of the Trump campaign was still nothing like the F.B.I.'s misconduct under J. Edgar Hoover. And despite Trump's nepotistic impulses, even he hasn't yet imitated Kennedy's elevation of his own brother as attorney general. So the more modest case for Trump's impeachment isn't that it upholds a standard that's been honored since the founding. It's that after Richard Nixon we made an effort to limit the space for presidents to abuse their power, such limits are good things, and letting Trump get away with his Ukraine maneuver would be a form of backsliding -- one that would encourage further abuses from a presidency whose direct power over policy now arguably exceeds its powers in any era in the past. And since Trump presumably will not be removed, in practice we're testing a more modest argument still: that whether it's perjury or a ""perfect phone call"" with Ukraine, impeachment-without-removal can function like an act of censure, a punishment that restrains misbehaving presidents without actually removing them. As a system, this obviously pleases nobody. But in the debate I've just sketched it does offer something to both sides.

Science,Water Droplets Don't Just Hover on a Hot Pan. They Roll.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/14/science/leidenfrost-effect.html,"Drip water on a hot pan, and the droplets will skitter around the pan, speeding like tiny mad hovercraft on cushions of steam. This is the Leidenfrost effect, which you've probably experienced while cooking. Johann Gottlob Leidenfrost, a German doctor and theologian, described the phenomenon in 1756 in a book about the properties of water. But French scientists have now figured out something new about those skittering drops. When they are small enough -- about a millimeter in diameter -- the roiling of heat in the liquid will cause the droplet to tilt and rotate. That, in turn, propels the droplet to roll.

Scientists -- and home cooks -- never noticed this before, because no one had tried pinning a water droplet on a precisely flat surface. Plus, since water is clear, you usually can't see which way the liquid is churning.

It was already known that the droplets, levitating on top of a layer of vapor, move easily, but the presumption was that they were sliding down a slope or pushed by air currents. The new research shows that they can move all by themselves. ""It's embarrassingly simple,"" David Quere, a scientist at the Ecole Polytechnique and ESPCI Paris, said of the discovery. ""The drop is running away,"" he said. ""It has a little motor inside, which is surprising. From this view, it's amazingly different from usual drops, which, of course, stay where you place them."" Dr. Quere and his colleagues described the research this week in the journal Nature Physics. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.]

In the experiments, droplets of water were placed on a very flat, very hot, nonabsorbent surface, held in place by a needle. (For the skittering Leidenfrost effect to occur, the surface has be at least about 400 degrees Fahrenheit , well above the boiling temperature of water. Some recipes use that as a test to see whether a pan is hot enough.) Larger drops, those more than 1.5 millimeters in diameter, are more flattened in shape (Dr. Quere described them as puddles). Within the droplet, the liquid splits into two convective cells rotating in opposite directions. Think of two wheels spinning in opposite directions toward each other, one largely canceling out the other. (Tracers mixed in with the water enabled the scientists to observe the flow.)

As the water evaporates, the droplet shrinks and becomes nearly spherical, with room for just one convective cell. When the needle is lifted, the smaller droplet speeds off in the direction of the convective spin. The next step in their experiments is guiding the droplets through grooves or differences in temperature, Dr. Quere said. There are additional fundamental phenomena to be studied, such as why the temperature of the surface must be far above the boiling point before the drops start levitating. ""Very remarkably, there is no answer to this question today,"" Dr. Quere said.","Physicists took a deeper look at the Leidenfrost effect, which you've likely experienced when you've dripped water into a pan to test its temperature.",d5fa4d90-4a71-599f-9aae-a85fa23bdc43,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/18/science/15OBSTB-DROPLET/15OBSTB-DROPLET-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=551&w=1050&s=3e9b8bafcce061466c39013dadaab50adecfc2034b73ea4dd49337cfc4a531ae&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A composite image showing the successive states of a single water droplet deposited on a hot plate, colored to indicate its rolling motion.",d5fa4d90-4a71-599f-9aae-a85fa23bdc43,N24News/imgs/d5fa4d90-4a71-599f-9aae-a85fa23bdc43.jpg,2

Economy,Janet Yellen and House Republicans Clash Over Fed's Performance,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/business/economy/janet-yellen-house-financial-services-republicans.html,"WASHINGTON -- Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, sparred with House Republicans on Wednesday about the value of financial regulation and the effectiveness of monetary policy in a testy session that showed the gulf between the central bank and the conservatives who control Capitol Hill. During a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee, Ms. Yellen was relentlessly pressed by Republicans to concede that the American economy was broken, that the Fed had failed to fix the underlying problems and that excessive regulation was making things worse. Members of the committee frequently interrupted Ms. Yellen, who tends to speak slowly and at length, and showed frustration when she did not concede their points. For the most part, she did not. Ms. Yellen acknowledged that economic growth had been ""quite disappointing,"" but she said the Fed's efforts had contributed to strong job growth since the 2008 financial crisis, and she defended the value of the regulatory changes that came after it.

""I think financial regulation has resulted in a stronger financial system and less risk than we had before the crisis,"" Ms. Yellen said. ""It's allowed us to have stronger growth and a faster recovery."" The hearing was contentious from the outset. Representative Jeb Hensarling, a Texas Republican who is the chairman of the committee, began with an indictment of what he described as the Fed's failures. ""After eight years of the largest monetary policy stimulus in our history and the most unconventional monetary policy in our history, Americans recently received disappointing economic news yet again,"" he said. ""It is official: The economy grew at a measly 1.6 percent in 2016, when our historic norm is twice that."" Mr. Hensarling also criticized ""a failed regulatory state"" that he said was impeding growth. Ms. Yellen sought to strike a cooperative tone in her responses. She emphasized the Fed's willingness to work with the Trump administration. She pledged to meet with the new Treasury secretary, Steven T. Mnuchin, just as often as she met with his predecessor, Jacob J. Lew. She said she agreed with the basic principles in President Trump's recent executive order calling for federal agencies to evaluate the efficacy of regulation. The Fed has its own doubts about some of the postcrisis changes in financial regulation, like the so-called Volcker Rule, which limits the kinds of investments financial institutions can make. Banks regard the rule as an arbitrary restraint, and Republicans would like to erase it. The Fed did not back its creation, and Ms. Yellen stopped short of rising to its defense. ""I think the evidence on this matter is conflicting,"" she said of its impact. On Tuesday, in testimony before the Senate Banking Committee, Ms. Yellen said she favored some reduction in the regulatory burden imposed upon smaller banks. She reiterated that view on Wednesday. ""I think we should be heavily focused on using every tool available to us to reduce regulatory burden on those banks,"" she said.

But Ms. Yellen did not endorse a broader rollback of the regulations for big banks. ""Is it not true that if we would throw off the shackles of unreasonable regulation that we would have had a faster, steeper recovery?"" asked Representative Bill Huizenga, Republican of Michigan. Ms. Yellen responded, ""I would not generally agree with that."" Republicans also pressed Ms. Yellen repeatedly to suspend rule writing until the Trump administration could appoint a new vice chairman for regulation. Representative Andy Barr, Republican of Kentucky and the new chairman of the monetary policy subcommittee, told Ms. Yellen it was ""imperative"" for the Fed to refrain from issuing new regulations until Mr. Trump had a chance to place his own people at the central bank. ""Many financial institutions in my district and around the country are concerned that the Fed may cram through a new wave of regulations before these new governors are confirmed,"" Mr. Barr said. Mr. Trump can quickly fill three of the seven seats on the Fed's board. Republicans held open two seats by refusing to consider President Obama's nominees, and a third seat will open in April with the resignation of Daniel K. Tarullo. Mr. Trump has yet to select nominees for the vacancies.
* Retail earnings and Black Friday: the week in business.
* Elizabeth Holmes will resume her testimony in her fraud trial. The Fed has completed the bulk of the new regulations required by the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, and Ms. Yellen said the regulatory docket was "" relatively light."" But she did not agree to suspend the Fed's work. House Republicans have circulated a variety of proposals aimed at constraining the Fed's approach to monetary policy and subjecting the central bank to increased oversight. The Fed has strongly opposed such changes, and Ms. Yellen suggested on Wednesday that Republicans had not been clear about what issues they wanted to fix.

Lawmakers, she said, should ""decide what the problem is that needs to be addressed."" The House proposals have found little traction in the Senate, but supporters are hoping that the Trump administration will embrace some version of the proposals. ""Clearly, Americans have a newfound expectation that our economy will grow healthier with different policies coming out of Washington,"" Mr. Hensarling said. Several Democrats on the committee sought to defend the Fed and the Dodd-Frank Act by pointing to the strength of economic growth. The United States is in the midst of one of the longest expansions in the nation's history, and job growth has been strong. Representative Maxine Waters of California, the committee's ranking Democrat, led Ms. Yellen through a call-and-response routine that resulted in a list of upbeat indicators. How many jobs has the economy added? But Republicans, early and often, pressed Ms. Yellen to acknowledge that the postcrisis performance of the American economy remained disappointing: Growth has been tepid; labor force participation remains low, productivity growth weak. ""Doesn't this underscore the failure of unconventional policies to deliver the expected results?"" Mr. Barr asked.",The Federal Reserve chairwoman's appearance before the board made clear the gulf between how conservatives and the central bank view the economy.,dd9368fc-b985-5489-8cf3-88e9863150ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/16/business/16FED/16FED-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=f68a437a83de562f332370cc303a7cdbb2bafbe29a458e3ea0350ead73bba0a7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Janet Yellen, the Federal Reserve chairwoman, arriving to testify on Wednesday before a House committee.",dd9368fc-b985-5489-8cf3-88e9863150ab,N24News/imgs/dd9368fc-b985-5489-8cf3-88e9863150ab.jpg,8
Travel,Headed to Miami? Here's What You Need to Know About Zika,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/19/travel/miami-zika-travel.html,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is suggesting that pregnant women and their partners postpone trips to Miami-Dade County after five people, three of them tourists, were diagnosed with Zika that was transmitted from mosquitos in Miami Beach, the second reported area in the United States where transmissions have occurred. At least fourteen people have contracted the virus from mosquitoes in Miami's Wynwood area, prompting the C.D.C to issue its first call for pregnant women to steer clear of a section in Miami. Here is what travelers need to know if they are in Miami or plan to travel there.

Is it safe to travel to Miami?

In general, yes, said Dr. Stephen Morse, an epidemiology professor at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, although pregnant women or women who wish to become pregnant in the near future may want to avoid visiting. ""Miami is definitely a city in a subtropical climate, and it has plenty of mosquitoes year-around so there is always a chance of getting bitten,"" he said.

Will airlines let you change or cancel your flight?

Delta Air Lines has been dealing with customers who want to make changes or cancel their reservations on flights to areas affected by Zika since February, said Morgan Durrant, a spokesman. ""Refunds are and have been available,"" he said in an email. ""Customers are asked to call and speak to a Delta reservation sales specialist to discuss.""

JetBlue is also working with travelers scheduled to fly to Miami. The airline's policy states: ""Customers traveling to/from destinations reported by the C.D.C. to be affected by the Zika virus may qualify for a refund or the option to make changes to their current travel plans to alternate destinations or travel dates.""",A look at how airlines and hotels are responding to the C.D.C.'s suggestion that tourists postpone trips to Miami Beach.,f8a7189f-ab3f-56cf-80fa-b5ecad57c808,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/08/19/travel/19travel-zika/19travel-zika-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=1b7378ef430dbb3dec67000ea68cc372c00817a13f4add86e5f1b757ac3e48b7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A view of South Point and Fisher Island in Miami Beach.,f8a7189f-ab3f-56cf-80fa-b5ecad57c808,N24News/imgs/f8a7189f-ab3f-56cf-80fa-b5ecad57c808.jpg,4
Your Money,Wealthy Hesitate to Take a Break on Estate Taxes,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/14/your-money/taxes/14wealth.html,"PRESIDENT OBAMA and the Republican Congress gave the wealthiest Americans an enormous gift at the end of 2010. They increased the exemption on a series of estate-related taxes and lowered the tax rate on any amount over those limits. The catch is it lasts only two years. But five months into the tax break, the people able to fully exploit it are more tentative than wealth advisers had expected. That could be a problem because this exemption, which will most likely be used to give money to children and grandchildren, is done through complicated structures that take up to a year to set up. (The exception, of course, is if someone simply dies. Then, the new estate tax exemptions of $5 million per person and a rate of 35 percent above that kick in.) So why are the richest Americans hesitating to take advantage of this tax break? It comes down to two fears that bedevil everyone: they don't want to put too much aside now in case they need it later, and they don't want to take away their children's incentive to work. ""Everyone is trying to capitalize on this two-year window because there is this 'use it or lose it' mentality and a need to plan wisely,"" said Coventry Edwards-Pitt, senior wealth adviser at Ballentine Partners. ""But the ideal answer from a tax mitigation standpoint is probably different from what most families can handle.""

While the changes to the estate tax might not produce a revenue windfall for the United States Treasury from people opting to pay the 35 percent gift tax, they could lead to a conversation that families at all levels of wealth rarely have: how do they want their lives, and by extension their wealth, to influence their children? MONEY-MAKING OPPORTUNITIES By the end of 2010, many very wealthy couples had already given as much as $2 million in tax-free gifts, the previous limit. But the estimates of a gift of another $8 million, to hit the new $10 million limit, could be a windfall to heirs. Lisa Featherngill, director of wealth planning at Wells Fargo Family Wealth, said an $8 million gift made to a ""grantor dynasty trust"" -- a structure that allows the people making the gift to pay taxes on the capital gains during their lifetime -- could grow to as much as $140 million over 40 years. This potential growth is one of the reasons advisers say that few people are looking to exceed the exemption level. The other is that some feel the economy could weaken again and they might need their money. Milo Zidek, who made his money in the reinsurance business, said he and his wife, both 76 and living in south Florida, would use the additional $8 million gift tax exemption to transfer money to their children and grandchildren.

""I doubt we'll do more than that,"" he said. ""We've got to live. And you don't want to overwhelm them."" To that end, Mr. Zidek said, they would put the money in trust ""because we don't want them to become wild and crazy guys."" That, he said, was ""improbable but nonetheless we want to keep their noses to the grindstone."" DETERMINING STRATEGY Mr. Zidek's concern is typical of what this window has prompted: will the rush to take advantage of a tax break turn heirs into trust-fund brats? Advisers are counseling clients to spend significant time determining their intentions before they even think about the amount of the gift. ""As a C.P.A., I can run through the numbers, but that doesn't take into account the angst over the giving,"" Ms. Featherngill said. Once they have decided the family philosophy for their money, there is no shortage of ways to give far more than the $10 million a couple is now allowed to provide tax-free. Any private banker will reel off a list of obscurely named financial vehicles that will multiply the value of the gift. Samuel V. Petrucci, director at Credit Suisse Private Bank, said he was working with an investment banker worth $75 million who was hesitant to put securities or cash into a trust for his children. Instead, he and his wife have decided to put a vacation home worth about $9 million into a trust that allows them to use the home until it passes on to their children. ""This client 100 percent understands why they should give $10 million,"" Mr. Petrucci said. ""To go from $75 million to $65 million doesn't work for him. But in his mind, he is willing to part with the vacation home that he wants to keep in the family for a very long time.""

The mental dodge here is not that unusual, the advisers said. Even someone with more than enough money may have trouble parting with it. Still, the banker has to hope that his children do not sell the home in his golden years -- and that any squabbling over the property when he is gone does not destroy his family. INCENTIVES TO WORK So how do parents keep this tax break from creating a disincentive for children to do anything with their lives? Steven D. Hayworth, chief executive of Gibraltar Private Bank and Trust, said the wealthy needed to be aware of the potential size of the minimum payments from the trusts they set up. Consider a trust that grew to $30 million and then paid out a relatively low 3 percent distribution each year. ""That's $75,000 a month hitting their bank account,"" Mr. Hayworth said. ""You have the tax motivation to do this. But it's every bit as important to think, 'What does success look like for my family?' "" This fear of giving too much is motivating a California entrepreneur who owns several real estate-related companies. He asked not to be named because his family did not know his plans. At 66, he has five children from two marriages and a net worth around $80 million. He said he intended to use his additional gift tax exemption, but was struggling with how to build incentives into the trusts. ""I'm more worried about ruining my kids and grandkids,"" he said. ""What I'm planning on doing is trying to keep incentivizing the kids to do well. I want them to believe that from the time they get out of college until they're 45, they have to swim in the big business ocean, and I want to reward them with some sort of matching program."" But how can this be done effectively? Incentives are put into trusts all the time, but they do not always have the desired effect. An income-matching incentive could persuade a child who wants to be a teacher to become an investment banker instead.","With a two-year window that makes it cheaper to transfer wealth to offspring, the richest Americans are struggling with how much money to give.",37742f91-36cd-59a2-a0db-b5d3f396554b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/05/14/your-money/taxes/14wealth-span/14wealth-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=852c4cca537b0afad9ba40625273108d44e8fd4b10727f928c5fbeaeda07e1e3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Milo Zidek, at home in North Palm Beach, Fla., said he and his wife would use the additional $8 million gift tax exemption to transfer money to their children and grandchildren.",37742f91-36cd-59a2-a0db-b5d3f396554b,N24News/imgs/37742f91-36cd-59a2-a0db-b5d3f396554b.jpg,21
Travel,Expert Advice: Should 'Snowbirds' Stay or Go?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/travel/coronavirus-snowbirds-advice.html,"For the millions of Americans who make the migration between North and South as the seasons change, the coronavirus outbreak has created a difficult dilemma: Are they better off staying where they are, or heading home? Because they are older, the so-called snowbirds, are at higher risk of Covid-19 complications.

Choosing to return home or to stay put if one is healthy is an individual decision, experts said. Though some, like Dr. Isaac Weisfuse, a medical epidemiologist and adjunct professor at Cornell University Public Health, came down adamantly on the stay side of the question.

[Read the stories of older Americans facing the question of whether to return North.]

""Stay where you are, especially if your situation allows you to avoid contact with other people,"" he said. ""If you are perfectly safe quarantining where you are, that would be preferable than driving many hours in a car and risking exposure.""

For those who still aren't sure, here's what to take into account.

Science,Aromatherapy in the Apiary Is What Bees Need,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/21/science/bees-pollination-scent.html,"To fill your homes with blueberries, sunflowers and almonds, farmers rent honeybees. When all goes well, the bees pollinate the flowers, resulting in ample yields. But sometimes the rental bees buzz off and pollinate wildflowers instead.

The problem is a matter of timing. For a hive to pollinate crops well, it needs to be settled and happy in its environment. That means it should be placed on a farm before the crop blooms. But when crops flower later than farmers expect them to, rental bees may develop a predilection for nectar from wildflowers near the fields -- and ignore the crops.

Walter M. Farina, a biologist at the University of Buenos Aires, and his colleagues have figured out a solution to this problem involving scent, which they reported on Thursday in the journal Current Biology.

Dr. Farina knew from previous work that hives remember the scents of food collected in the past. Most importantly, he knew that these memories could bias where bees forage.",Honeybees were better at pollinating crops after scent training.,71463bd6-8a01-59bd-9e11-41bcdd24251f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/06/science/21TB-BEES/21TB-BEES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=80320500c6b9d650512556288248d0b859938b581cdcb762dc509b8b062d5fbb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Bees&rsquo; memories of food comes from scent, which led researchers to wonder if they could guide bees toward certain agricultural crops with the power of odors.",71463bd6-8a01-59bd-9e11-41bcdd24251f,N24News/imgs/71463bd6-8a01-59bd-9e11-41bcdd24251f.jpg,2
Travel,"From Wine to Sweets, Greek Goodies at a New Athens Market",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/29/travel/yolenis-athens-market-review.html,"Up on the main floor an informal restaurant with a retractable roof offers two menus. One, called Topos, or place of origin in Greek, was created by Yoleni's to revive various grandmothers' lost recipes. Grilled sardines wrapped in vine leaves were piquant and lemony with a hint of thyme and garlic. From the second menu, we chose the cheese and egg pita, a traditional Greek pie, from Roumeli ( c entral Greece); the pie was unlike many of its other filo-dough counterparts: its crust was thin and crisp but not at all overpowered by its filling.

Up a floor is a meat lover paradise: a butcher shop shares the space with a steakhouse; cuts are courtesy of the shop, Carnicero Meat & Delicatessen, but even a vegetarian like me won't go hungry. Their roasted root vegetables served with avocado-yogurt sauce were sweet on the inside, crisp on the outside and just the right amount of smoky.

For dessert we returned to the downstairs dining space to try the chocolate and nuts pita, an earthy, slightly bitter combination of dark chocolate, roasted hazelnuts and Aegina pistachio spread.

Your Money,"For Millionaire Immigrants, a Global Welcome Mat",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/25/your-money/wealth-immigration-millionaires-australia-canada.html,"With all the debate over immigration in the United States and Europe, one group of immigrants is getting a red-carpet welcome around the world: millionaires. Last year, a record 82,000 millionaires moved to another country, according to a new study. While their numbers are a small fraction of the world's migratory population, and of the world's millionaires, wealthy people are being courted and cosseted by host countries like never before. The growing contrast between migrants who are poor and those who are wealthy reveals a less-noticed form of global inequality, as well as an acceleration of a new culture of the rootless, borderless rich. ""The wealthy today don't have a country,"" said Reaz H. Jafri, a New York-based partner at Withers Worldwide, a law firm that helps wealthy clients move and relocate around the world. ""They don't view their success as being related or dependent on a single country, but on their own business strategies. It's amazing to me how many of the very wealthy are going totally mobile.""

The rich have always been a restless class, of course, moving with the seasons or the social circuit. But the current wave of millionaire migrations seems to have reached a new level, with wealthy families changing citizenship, sending their children overseas or moving permanently to the nation of their choice. Rather than fleeing economic ruin or conflict, millionaire migrants are shopping the world for the best schools, financial safety and lifestyle. Technology, coupled with the rise of global markets and global investors, has given rise to multinational millionaires who increasingly have no nation. According to New World Wealth, a market research firm based in Johannesburg, South Africa, the number of millionaires moving to another country jumped 28 percent in 2016 from the previous year, reaching the highest level the firm has found in its four years of measuring. Millionaire migration has grown 60 percent since 2013, the firm's findings show, and there are no signs that it is slowing. Andrew Amoils, head of research at New World Wealth, said he expected the ranks of millionaires on the move to top 100,000 within the next two to three years. That's still a small slice of the estimated 13.6 million millionaires around the world, defined as those having at least $1 million in assets (minus liabilities), not including their primary residence.

New World Wealth's data includes only millionaires who have physically moved to a country for a period of at least six months. It uses surveys, real-estate data and research with relocation firms and other specialists for its estimates. Add to those numbers the wealthy who have changed or added citizenships, those who spend part of their time in various countries or own homes in multiple nations, and the numbers grow much larger. ""We looked at the people who truly moved,"" Mr. Amoils said. ""But the universe of multinational wealth is obviously much larger.""

The map of migration is also changing rapidly. Australia is now the world's top destination for millionaires, beating the United States for the second straight year, according to New World Wealth. An estimated 11,000 millionaires moved to Australia in 2016, compared with the 10,000 who moved to the United States. Canada ranked third, with 8,000, followed by the United Arab Emirates and New Zealand. As for countries that millionaires are fleeing, France tops the list, with 12,000 moving out during 2016. China ranked second, with 9,000, followed by Brazil, India and Turkey. Mr. Amoils said Australia was especially attractive to Chinese millionaires, given its relative proximity, its wide choice of private schools, its clean environment and its political and economic stability. Australia, like many countries, has also created money-for-visa programs to make it easier for rich immigrants to move in and become citizens.

In 2012, the country introduced a ""golden-ticket"" investor visa program that fast-tracks and eases the residency requirement for a permanent visa. Millionaires need to invest 5 million Australian dollars (about $3.8 million) to qualify for the program, officially called the Special Investor Visa. Since its creation, more than 1,300 foreigners, nearly 90 percent of them from China, have used the program, according to government statistics. The government also has an investor visa program that allows people to invest 1 million Australian dollars (about $770,000). That option comes with more restrictions, and it takes longer to get a permanent visa. The other two top destinations, Canada and the United States, also have generous visa programs for the wealthy. America's EB-5 program requires a $500,000 investment, although there are proposals in Congress to raise that figure -- which hasn't changed in 27 years -- to over $1 million. Canada scrapped one of its main investor-visa programs in 2014, but there are other programs available for wealthy foreigners. The number of 10-year visas issued to Chinese citizens more than quadrupled between 2012 and 2015, to 337,000. Mr. Amoils said the main reason millionaires are leaving China is to educate their children in Western or Australian schools that will give them a better education and connections for their careers. Of course, living in a country where billionaires literally disappear amid the government's crackdown on corruption also drives the rich and their fortunes overseas. A 2014 report from Hurun, a research firm in Shanghai that tracks the wealthy, found that 64 percent of Chinese millionaires were considering or were in the process of moving, with education topping the list of reasons. Mr. Jafri of Withers Worldwide said that personal safety goes hand in hand with education for many of the world's millionaires when considering a move. Many of his clients are Latin Americans seeking a haven from kidnapping and crime. ""My clients say, 'In New York, I can walk my daughter to Brearley, while in Buenos Aires we have to get into an armored car,' "" Mr. Jafri said.",There is one category of migrants that countries embrace: the very rich. And more of them are moving than ever. Their top destination?

Technology,"Farhad's, Mike's and Cade's Week in Tech: More Uber, With a Dash of Amazon",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/technology/farhads-mikes-and-cades-week-in-tech-more-uber-with-a-dash-of-amazon.html,"Each Saturday, Farhad Manjoo and Mike Isaac, technology reporters at The New York Times, review the week's news, offering analysis and maybe a joke or two about the most important developments in the tech industry. This week, Farhad and Mike also talked with Cade Metz, who just joined The Times as a technology reporter. Farhad: Hello, Mike! There's a lot going on in the world, but can I just say: How great is it that the Warriors won the N.B.A. championship and proved, once and for all, that the Bay Area is the best? California4Eva! Anyway, how are you? Mike: Ahoy, Farhad! I don't care about sports, so I won't pretend to now for the sake of exchanging pleasantries. You know what I do care about? Artificial intelligence. No, I'm not referring to your intellect, Farhad. I'm making a quick segue into introducing our newest addition to the tech team, Cade Metz. He just joined us.

Cade: Yes, I am the first A.I. reporter ever at The Times. I'm a bot trained from reams of data detailing the behavior of some Silicon Valley hack during his five years at Wired magazine, incluing al thos typos. So when I insult you and Farhad on Twitter, don't take it personally. That's just the way I was built. O.K., that's not true. I'm not a bot. I'm just some hack who covers A.I. The truth is: A.I. is a long way from mimicking the behavior of a Times reporter. I hope. Mike: Elon Musk was right. We are all doomed. Farhad: Great, let's chat about tech news. So the big thing this week was Uber, more Uber and still more Uber, with a little bit of Amazon and Whole Foods thrown in. But we'll get to all that in a bit. Let's start with other stuff. Facebook said that it would begin to explain to the public how it tackles ""hard questions"" that arise out of its service -- things like how Facebook affects democracies, or whether and how kids should use it. In its first such effort, the company detailed how it's using artificial intelligence to fight the spread of terrorists online. I have to say, I was really impressed with this whole exercise. I think tech companies have long been too reluctant to talk about the potential dangers of their technology. It's great that Facebook -- after, of course, a lot of questions and prodding arising out of its role in the election -- is taking these issues seriously. But Cade, you're our resident A.I. expert, so could you explain what exactly Facebook is doing, and whether it'll work?

Cade: Well, the people who wrote that blog post are policy folks, not engineers. They're using the term A.I. in the broadest of ways (like so many people these days). In most cases, they use A.I. to mean technology, as opposed to human involvement. Some of the stuff they talk about, like identifying an image known to be related to terrorism, will work well. But other stuff, like the experimental system that seeks to identify online conversation and other natural language that points to terrorism, won't work really well for years. (Hint: experimental is a key word). That kind of thing requires A.I. that is still very much under development. The other key bit is where they say: ""A.I. can't catch everything."" That's an understatement. When it comes to catching unwanted behavior on Facebook-- whether it's someone planning an act of terrorism or spreading fake news -- Zuckerberg and company still need help from real live humans who see this stuff as it happens. That means Facebook users who can flag questionable content with a click, and it means the many contractors hired to review what has been flagged and remove what needs to be removed. This is stuff is very hard, and it will continue to be very hard until A.I. gets a lot better. All that said, I agree with you, Farhad. Hard stuff should be taken seriously. Farhad: This week, Silicon Valley also celebrated the life of Charles Thacker. Cade, you're a kind of Valley historian, aren't you? What can you tell us about Thacker?

Cade: If you use a computer or a smartphone or the internet, you should read our obituary of Thacker. He is one of just a handful of people who designed the fundamental technologies that drive everything we do online. In Thacker's case, he was among the researchers at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Lab in the 1970s who built the Alto, the machine with the graphical user interface that spawned the Macs and the PCs and, eventually, the smartphones that are such a big part of our everyday lives. Plus, he helped design Ethernet, the networking technology that linked the Altos together -- and now links all the machines in your office, not to mention the thousands of machines inside the giant data centers that feed all the internet apps you use.

Think of it like this: When Steve Jobs died, he deserved avalanche of tributes that arrived from across the globe, and Thacker deserves much the same. Farhad: Now let's get to Uber. Months after a former employee, Susan Fowler, detailed incidents of sexual harassment and rampant misogyny at the company, the company announced a huge set of reforms to its culture and workplace practices. Also, Travis Kalanick, the C.E.O. and basically the embodiment of Uber, said he would be taking a leave of absence. These are huge changes. I'm not sure if people who don't follow the tech industry get this -- a few months ago, it was unimaginable that Kalanick, who has overwhelming control of the company, could ever be pressured to step away. And if Uber actually follows through on its plan to remake its culture, it will operate like a completely different company. But that's what makes me so skeptical of this plan. Can a $70 billion company really change so radically? Mike: My official assessment: I have no clue. To be honest, a lot of this seems to hinge on the personality of Travis, who is famously aggressive and obsessive. And while he's said he's taking time off right now, I do wonder whether that will hold true -- especially since Uber is undergoing its most prolonged set of crises, um, ever. I think companywide DNA, instilled and fostered by the founders, is seriously difficult to change. Just ask Twitter. That said, we should give Uber a chance -- just like it is giving peace a chance! -- and see what the company looks like six months to a year from now.

Cade: However all this shakes out, one thing is clear: Uber will continue to dominate the ride-hailing market for years to come. Its lead is just too big. But the slightly more distant future is driverless cars, and the scandals -- among other things -- have really hurt the company's effort to make headway in this area. The question for me is whether Uber can still compete in this race to A.I. But, well, I'm an A.I. reporter. Mike: Indeed you are, robot Cade. And now to get as far away from A.I. as possible -- what do you think of Amazon's purchase of Whole Foods? Cade: Actually there is an A.I. angle. As we point out in our piece about Amazon's deal to acquire Whole Foods, this is part of a major pivot into brick-and-mortar stores. Among other things, Amazon is experimenting with systems that will let you automatically pay for your groceries as you walk out of a store with them -- A.I. is everywhere! And somewhere down the line, Whole Foods can feed those efforts to streamline the way we buy stuff in person. But this can also feed the company's larger mission to sell stuff online. What Amazon is good at is building enormous supply chains and physical infrastructure (warehouses, trucks, planes, even drones) that provide ways of delivering goods to your door much quicker than competitors can. By the same token, Whole Foods puts more Amazon groceries closer to you. Those stores aren't just stores. They're part of the supply chain. Mike: This Whole Foods talk is making me hungry. Thanks for joining us, Cade. Until next week.","And a discussion of how Facebook is harnessing artificial intelligence — well, almost — to take on ""hard questions.""",b45714b6-fec6-5843-bbe9-5775bc61018a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/18/technology/18technewsletter-web/18technewsletter-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=20cb60589a47762a81e511fe3125762022b1bd2e6287baf28b9404bb1fc9df16&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Uber has announced sweeping reforms to its culture and workplace practices.,b45714b6-fec6-5843-bbe9-5775bc61018a,N24News/imgs/b45714b6-fec6-5843-bbe9-5775bc61018a.jpg,20

Science,This Rodent Was Giant. Its Brain Was Tiny.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/12/science/rodent-brain-fossil.html,"When you look at a reconstruction of the skull and brain of Neoepiblema acreensis, an extinct rodent, it's hard to shake the feeling that something's not quite right.

Huddled at the back of the cavernous skull, the brain of the South American giant rodent looks really, really small. By some estimates, it was around three to five times smaller than scientists would expect from the animal's estimated body weight of about 180 pounds, and from comparisons to modern rodents. In fact, 10 million years ago the animal may have been running around with a brain weighing half as much as a mandarin orange, according to a paper published Wednesday in Biology Letters.

The glory days of rodents, in terms of the animals' size, were quite a long time ago, said Leonardo Kerber, a paleontologist at Universidade Federal de Santa Maria in Brazil and an author of the new study. Today rodents are generally dainty, with the exception of larger creatures like the capybara that can weigh as much as 150 pounds. But when it comes to relative brain size, N. acreensis, represented in this study by a fossil skull unearthed in the 1990s in the Brazilian Amazon, seems to be an extreme.

The researchers used an equation that relates the body and brain weight of modern South American rodents to get a ballpark estimate for N. acreensis, then compared that with the brain weight implied by the volume of the cavity in the skull. The first method predicted a brain weighing about 4 ounces, but the volume suggested a dinky 1.7 ounces. Other calculations, used to compare the expected ratio of the rodent's brain and body size with the actual fossil, suggested that N. acreensis' brain was three to five times smaller than one would expect.",Reconstruction of a fossil of an extinct South American relative of the capybara shows it didn't have much space in its skull for a brain.,8c4fd4d0-5242-5c06-b9b8-9cac2ef823a0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/25/science/12OBS-rodent/12tb-rodent-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=398e794d9b5497b263a1733641cf7d97b44fd0e2f4999d4c1599fdb380860ebc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An artist&rsquo;s impression of Neoepiblema acreensis.,8c4fd4d0-5242-5c06-b9b8-9cac2ef823a0,N24News/imgs/8c4fd4d0-5242-5c06-b9b8-9cac2ef823a0.jpg,2
Theater,"Yes, We Liked the Berkshires Shows. Here's $2 Million.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/29/theater/berkshire-barrington-theater-gross-gift.html,"The calls came in late August. A couple who had moved up to the Berkshires during the pandemic had seen the first two union-approved theatrical productions of the summer, and were impressed. Now they had a question: What would it cost to keep those theaters intact for another six months? The couple introduced themselves to the leaders of one theater over Zoom, and to the others under a tent. And now those conversations have borne fruit: a little more than $1 million for each Western Massachusetts theater, enough to preserve their staffs and facilities through the winter. ""I was like, 'What?'"" recalled Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of one of the theaters, the Barrington Stage Company. ""My development director almost passed out."" The gifts, to Barrington Stage and the Berkshire Theater Group, have an only-in-2020 back story. The couple, Mary Chris and Alan Bassman, sold their New Jersey home in June and relocated to a condo they had purchased two years ago in Pittsfield, Mass., where the theaters are based. Mrs. Bassman, a 62-year-old hand therapist, had been furloughed from her job because of the pandemic; Mr. Bassman, 73, is retired.

They had long been theater lovers -- she adores a good issue play, while he loves a big musical (they're planning to name their new dog Marius, after a character in ""Les Miserables""). In the summer of 2019, hoping to meet people in the Berkshires, they had volunteered at Barrington Stage, working as ushers and occasionally at the concession stand. This summer, of course, not much was going on; the performing arts, central to life in the Berkshires, had largely shuttered to slow the spread of the virus. But Barrington Stage managed to put on the one-man play ""Harry Clarke,"" and Berkshire Theater Group staged the musical ""Godspell."" The two outdoor productions were the first authorized by the Actors' Equity union during the pandemic, and the Bassmans saw them both, as well as a pair of concerts, one at each theater.

""We were really impressed by what it took to do that,"" Mrs. Bassman said. ""And we were very concerned about the survival of the theaters here."" As it turns out, Mrs. Bassman's brother, Phill Gross, is a successful money manager with an interest in the arts, an enthusiasm for ""Jersey Boys"" and a passion for philanthropy. He is hoping to give away his entire salary, under a little-known provision of the CARES Act that allows people to use 100 percent of their income for tax-deductible charitable contributions this year.

So sister called brother to tell him about how impressed she was with the Berkshire theaters, and what she had learned about the theaters' financial situations. The siblings agreed to make the gifts, in memory of their mother, Mary Anne Gross, a regular theatergoer in Milwaukee and an occasional visitor to the Berkshires, who died in December. Each theater has already received a check from the Gross family to cover expenses through the end of the year -- $732,000 to Barrington Stage and $681,000 to Berkshire Theater Group -- as well as a pledge for another $350,000 each if matched by other donors, which would cover their expenses for the first three months of next year. ""Basically the goal was to get them through the winter,"" Mrs. Bassman said. ""They were both in debt from the work they did this summer, they both have multiple buildings, and they have tapped out their donors. They're still going to have a tough time."" Mr. Gross, 60, is the co-founder and managing director at Adage Capital Management. He is also helping several other theaters through the pandemic -- the Umbrella Arts Center, in his hometown, Concord, Mass.; the Grand Center for Arts & Culture, in New Ulm, Minn., where another sister is the executive director; and the Garry Marshall Theater, in Burbank, Calif., where the producer is Joseph Leo Bwarie, who played Frankie Valli in the Broadway production of ""Jersey Boys"" off and on for several years. (Mr. Gross got to know Bwarie while helping ""Jersey Boys"" raise money for Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS.) ""We're going to need this kind of art on the other side of Covid,"" Mr. Gross said. ""The first day I get vaccinated and I can go to a show, I'm going, and I don't want them not to have a show."" Although the Gross siblings and their mother had occasionally attended productions at the two theaters over the years, neither Ms. Boyd nor Kate Maguire, the artistic director and chief executive at Berkshire Theater Group, had met them. The administrators have in the past received surprise gifts -- Ms. Maguire talks of the occasional unexpected bequest, for example, and Ms. Boyd still remembers another usher who gave her a $50,000 check -- but not of this size.","This summer, a woman went to outdoor shows at two beloved theaters in Massachusetts.

Technology,Worries Grow That the Price of Bitcoin Is Being Propped Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html,"A growing number of virtual currency investors are worried that the prices of Bitcoin and other digital tokens have been artificially propped up by a widely used exchange called Bitfinex, which has a checkered history of hacks and opaque business practices. In December, Bitfinex was subpoenaed by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a United States regulatory agency. The news, first reported by Bloomberg on Tuesday and confirmed by a source familiar with the subpoena but not allowed to publicly discuss an ongoing investigation, led to a sell-off in most virtual currencies. The people behind Bitfinex issue a virtual currency called Tether. Unlike most digitals tokens, every Tether is supposed to be backed by traditional money -- the United States dollar. New Tether tokens are issued when investors give them dollars. One dollar is worth one token. Because of the credibility that comes with that tie to the dollar, Tether are often used to buy other virtual currencies like Bitcoin.

In recent months, however, many investors have been raising alarm bells about Tether. Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of new Tether were created; almost always when the prices of other virtual currencies were heading down. The Tether were used on the Bitfinex exchange to make big purchases of Bitcoin and other tokens, helping push their prices back up, according to multiple analyses of data from Bitfinex. ""This became more and more concerning, because every time the markets went down, you have seen the same thing happen,"" said Joey Krug, the co-chief investment officer at Pantera Capital, which runs several virtual currency hedge funds. ""It could mean that a lot of the rally over December and January might not have been real."" Long before news of the subpoena, Bitfinex, which is believed to host more trading than any other Bitcoin exchange in the world, had gained a reputation for a lack of transparency and a confusing structure, with European executives, offices in Asia and registration in the Caribbean. It is not yet clear what information the regulators are seeking. Technically, the Tether tokens are issued by a separate company (called Tether) that is owned and operated by the same people who run Bitfinex. The C.F.T.C. subpoenaed that company at the same time that it subpoenaed Bitfinex, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bitfinex has not commented on the subpoena or recent reports about Tether, and company officials did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In the past, the exchange's executives and spokesman have said that its customers are simply using Tether to buy virtual currencies as they might otherwise use United States dollars.

Bitfinex had contracted with an American firm, Friedman, to audit its records and prove that its operation of Tether is above board. But last week, Bitfinex said it was cutting ties with Friedman, after waiting months for it to finish the audit. That news generated more suspicion. ""It's a signal to the market of what those who have scrutinized the situation already believe: There is a problem here,"" said Jill Carlson, a former trader at Goldman Sachs who now consults with a variety of virtual currency companies. ""The dissolution of a relationship between an auditor and a company is very rarely a good sign that the company is behaving in accordance with market best practices.""

The concern about Bitfinex is one of several issues that have helped depress the value of virtual currencies over the last month, after a roaring, yearlong rally. Regulators in several countries, like South Korea and the United States, have expressed concerns about manipulation and fraud, and hinted at a crackdown. In Japan, a large virtual currency exchange, Coincheck, was hacked in late January and lost nearly $500 million worth of a virtual currency known as NEM, raising questions about the relatively untested security practices of virtual currency exchanges. Still, Japan is one of the few places where virtual currency exchanges are overseen by regulators. Many of the largest virtual currency exchanges, including Bitfinex, operate with essentially no regulatory oversight.

The company shared few details about these hacks. But after the biggest theft, in 2016, it was cut off by Wells Fargo and its banks in Taiwan. The banking problems have made it hard for customers to get money in and out of Bitfinex, but traders have continued to use the exchange, in part because of Tether. Tether offered a preliminary report last year from Friedman, the accounting firm, suggesting that it had bank accounts with dollars corresponding to all the Tether that had been issued. But the report was far from conclusive and Tether has never produced a real audit, leading to suspicions that Bitfinex may be printing virtual money backed by nothing. The Tether currency has been valuable to traders because it allows them to hold a stable token, tied to the value of the dollar, and move it quickly between virtual currency exchanges. But there is a downside. Because the identity of Tether holders is not always clear, the movement of the virtual token between exchanges -- and across national borders -- has raised concerns among lawyers about money laundering. The spread of Tether beyond Bitfinex has also spread the risk of its failure to other exchanges. Market analysts have grown particularly concerned with the rapid pace at which new Tether have been issued and their timing. In a single week in mid-January, $450 million new Tether were created, bringing the total amount of Tether to more than $2 billion.

Several anonymous reports circulating among traders, including one posted to a website last week, have pointed to data from Bitfinex itself, showing that the price of Bitcoin has frequently gone up soon after new Tether were created, generally as a result of big trades on Bitfinex. ""This absolutely reeks of price manipulation,"" a security researcher and market analyst, Tony Arcieri, wrote on his blog in mid-January. Many investors and traders have pushed back against that criticism, noting that smart traders simply may be looking to buy when the markets are down. ""My personal biases make me inclined to believe that Bitfinex is not using Tether to manipulate the price of Bitcoin,"" said Jeremy Gardner, a managing partner at the investment firm Ausum Ventures. ""If they have attempted to do so, which would be deeply concerning, it's hard to imagine that such fraudulent issuance at its current volume could single-handedly buoy the price of Bitcoin."" But Mr. Krug, at Pantera Capital, said that if Tether were really being used by investors, they would probably also want to buy new Tether when the markets were going up, which has not been the case. Also, they would not always want it in exact increments of $100 million, as has been the case. ""After you see this enough times, you just start to wonder what's really going on here,"" Mr. Krug said. The Bitcoin community is sensitive to the possibility of price manipulation because a team of academics published an article in early January suggesting that the price of Bitcoin was artificially inflated in 2013 by a single player operating on the largest exchange at the time, Mt. Gox.","When the price of Bitcoin goes down, activity on an influential exchange pumps it back up.

Books,Children's Book Authors Are Selling More Than Books. They're Taking a Stand.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/books/childrens-books-authors-activists-politics.html,"When photos began circulating of migrant children separated from their parents and placed in what looked like giant cages in detention centers, the young adult novelists Melissa de la Cruz and Margaret Stohl had an immediate response. After texting nine author friends asking what they could collectively do, Ms. de la Cruz and Ms. Stohl drafted a statement of protest called ""Kidlit Says No Kids in Cages,"" denouncing ""practices that should be restricted to the pages of dystopian novels."" Within minutes, they had 94 signatures from ""our fellow kidlit authors and supporters,"" Ms. de la Cruz said. A day later the statement was posted on Twitter with over 4,000 signatures. The group has now raised nearly $240,000 for legal services for the migrant families. They also expanded fund-raising to include online raffles and auctions for such services as manuscript evaluations by best-selling children's authors and ""character naming,"" with the winning donor's name to appear in an as-yet-to-be-written novel. Another group of kidlit authors, agents and publishers made an online clearinghouse of original posters designed by prominent children's book illustrators to protest family separation, all available for free download. Children's book creators similarly coordinated a response after the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shootings in Parkland, Fla., in January. The graphic novelist Raina Telgemeier and the YA novelist Jenny Han set up a group called Kidlit Marches for Kids, rallying colleagues to join the March 24 gun control protest spearheaded by the Parkland students, and designing a protest sign for marchers.

Children's books have always been political, of course -- that's why they are fixtures on lists of banned or censored books. And the welfare of children has long been at the forefront for authors who write for them. But current children's book creators are finding new outlets for their concerns, often banding together, with the support of social media, to increase their impact. If the old image of a writer for children was a wise-child genius in the mold of Maurice Sendak -- one who spoke up for kids and when necessary challenged the political powers that be, but indirectly -- these days, children's authors might not only hold signs at protest marches, they may also volunteer to strategize for a State Assembly race, or even run for office. Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

While conservatives like Bill O'Reilly have had a strong presence in the children's books landscape, with best-sellers like the young readers' editions of his Killing series about notorious assassinations and battles, the kidlit community skews to the political left, and no similar movement has emerged among conservative children's books authors or publishers. For Neal Porter, vice president and publisher of Neal Porter Books at the children's publisher Holiday House, the policy of separating families at the border marked a turning point. ""Our life and work revolves around children, so it's been a galvanizing force in our industry,"" he said. This month, Mr. Porter released ""Dreamers,"" written and illustrated by the Mexican-American author Yuyi Morales, which recounts her journey with her infant son to the United States. Ms. Morales finished the book earlier this year, but it became especially timely as its publication date approached. When she appeared at a June meeting of the American Booksellers' Association, several attendees burst into tears when they saw her.

""We're getting tons of proposals and manuscripts for both fiction and nonfiction with political themes -- immigration, internment, refugees, police brutality and sexual harassment,"" said Megan Tingley, executive vice president and publisher of Little, Brown Kids. She added that children's books on activism and social justice topics -- often beautifully designed -- are increasingly considered ""retail-friendly. They're not homework, people want them in their homes."" Over a dozen new children's books on the theme of resistance are in bookstores now, such as ""We Rise, We Resist, We Raise Our Voices,"" a collection of poems, essays and art by children's authors including Jason Reynolds and Jacqueline Woodson, and ""Steal This Country: A Handbook for Resistance, Persistence, and Fixing (Almost) Everything,"" by Alexandra Styron. ""We Say #NeverAgain: Reporting by the Parkland Student Journalists"" comes out next month.

Young adult fiction with themes of political activism has found a receptive teenage audience, most prominently with Angie Thomas's Black Lives Matter-inspired novel ""The Hate U Give,"" now in its second year on the Times best-seller list, and soon to be released as a movie, about a 16-year-old girl who sees her childhood friend killed by a police officer. The #NeverAgain movement for gun reform will take a turn in the fiction spotlight this fall when the best-selling novelist Ellen Hopkins's ""People Kill People"" -- a novel in verse with a spectral narrator called Violence who weaves together the stories of six people and a gun -- is published. YA readers in particular want authors to do more than just create stories -- they are expected to be visible as advocates for issues that affect teenagers. ""I don't know that a person can write the kind of book I write and not get involved somehow,"" said Nic Stone, whose debut novel, ""Dear Martin,"" included the story of a black teenager killed by a white police officer and another teen who composes letters to Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., to try to come to terms with contemporary racism. ""With the way social media functions, people have access to me as an author, which means it's no longer acceptable for me to just sit behind my computer,"" Ms. Stone said. At a recent workshop Ms. Stone organized at Charlottesville High School in Virginia to teach students about activism, she pointed out that ""Dr. King's first major act was writing a letter to the editor."" A social media presence linked to activism can also present knotty challenges to YA authors. ""I'm careful that what I'm saying on social media is sensitive to the full range of my readers, and is aimed at creating a positive force in the world,"" said Ms. Han. ""I don't want to make teenagers who have conservative parents feel embarrassed about their families."" For Ms. de la Cruz, the label ""political"" applied to her writing makes her uncomfortable. ""I get a little shy about saying my books are political because I don't like didactic books and don't intend to write one. I want to tell stories and if they enlighten, great,"" she said.

""After the 2016 election I was trying to finish my middle grade novel, but I felt like as I was typing there was a house on fire next to me and I needed to pick up a hose,"" said Melissa Walker, who has written 10 novels for young readers. She and other children's book authors, agents and publishers started a Super PAC dedicated to supporting Democratic candidates in state and local races around the country, raising over $400,000. They have since become part of another PAC with a similar mission, called Future Now Fund. Walker advises Future Now Fund's ""giving circles,"" in which people pool their money and donate to help influence local races, ""adopting"" states where fund-raising is more difficult. ""I've found the transition from children's writer to this to be seamless,"" she said. ""Something really important in politics is storytelling, and it's missing sometimes. I can go into these circles and say, 'this action is important,' and I can tell stories about why."" L.A. Campbell, who writes middle grade novels, coordinates a Future Now Fund giving circle called Propeller, which focuses on state political races, with a particular interest in Maine. The nature of children's literature, she noted, lends itself to the notion of an uphill struggle, so a daunting political cause feels like familiar ground. ""The main character of a children's book is going to have to solve a huge problem, and no one is coming to help. The adults aren't coming. His best friend isn't coming,"" Ms. Campbell said. Then there are those authors who go all the way with their activism, running for office themselves. In January, when Saira Rao, a political unknown, decided to challenge an 11-term Democratic incumbent in a Congressional primary in Colorado, her campaign material mentioned her career as a lawyer -- briefly. More important, in her view, was her role as an author and children's book producer: Ms. Rao co-founded In This Together Media, which specializes in children's and young adult books by diverse authors and with diverse protagonists. Congress, she said, ""looks an awful lot like the characters in kids' books: overwhelmingly white and male,"" and she was out to change that. Ms. Rao lost the race, but she did get 1 in 3 votes in her district against an incumbent candidate with millions in corporate PAC money, while accepting no corporate money herself. ""We are delighted by the strong showing,"" Ms. Rao said, adding that she plans to start a PAC ""to support black and brown women candidates all over the country."" In Texas, Laura Moser, a journalist who has written about education and a co-author of a YA series that included ""The Rise and Fall of a 10th Grade Social Climber,"" ran a spirited campaign but ultimately lost in a two-person runoff for the Democratic Congressional primary for Houston's seventh district.","They hold signs at protest marches, but they are also volunteering to strategize for a State Assembly race, and even running for office.",b8df1b6c-9702-5f19-a49e-ab4a176ad3e4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/07/books/review/07kidlitactivists-1-print/merlin_141947298_87373758-af82-4202-ab97-58db9c289dd5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=06f477ce96e42352f02e008a6772049730ed498760b338d10cb360bdf7545294&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Protesters gather at Books, Inc. bookstore in San Francisco.",b8df1b6c-9702-5f19-a49e-ab4a176ad3e4,N24News/imgs/b8df1b6c-9702-5f19-a49e-ab4a176ad3e4.jpg,13
Travel,"Italy, Beyond the Tourist Traps",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/08/travel/italy-beyond-the-tourist-traps.html,"John Hooper says he is often a little puzzled by Italy.

""It's a country that seems to be all on the surface, but actually a lot of things are hidden,"" said Mr. Hooper, author of ""The Italians,"" a cultural study of the country that was published by Viking last month. ""That can be at times sinister, but it can also be fascinating and rewarding, if you go off the beaten track.""

That is why Mr. Hooper, 65, thinks life is too short for tourist traps. Many people, he said, tend to prioritize Italy's famous sites over its more sincere side, when in fact they should do the opposite.

Mr. Hooper, who lives and works in Rome as a journalist for The Economist and The Guardian, recently gave some cultural and culinary advice for travelers wanting to see Italy from an insider's perspective. Following are edited excerpts from a conversation with Mr. Hooper.

Education,"College Graduation Rates Are Stagnant Even as Enrollment Rises, a Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/27/education/27remediation.html,"A report to be released on Tuesday by a group seeking to raise college graduation rates shows that despite decades of steadily climbing enrollment rates, the percentage of students making it to the finish line is barely budging. The group, Complete College America, is a nonprofit founded two years ago with financing from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Lumina Foundation and others. Its report, which had the cooperation of 33 governors, showed how many of the students in states completed their degrees, broken down into different categories , including whether enrollment is full- or part-time, or at a two- or four-year institution. The numbers are stark: In Texas, for example, of every 100 students who enrolled in a public college, 79 started at a community college, and only 2 of them earned a two-year degree on time; even after four years, only 7 of them graduated. Of the 21 of those 100 who enrolled at a four-year college, 5 graduated on time; after eight years, only 13 had earned a degree. Similarly, in Utah, for 100 students who enrolled in a public college, 71 chose a community college, 45 enrolling full time and 26 part time; after four years, only 14 of the full-time students and one of the part-time students graduated. Of the 29 who started at a four-year college, only 13 got their degree within eight years.

Because of gaps in federal statistics, students who enroll part time, or transfer have been nearly invisible, said Stan Jones, the president of Complete College America. ""We know they enroll, but we don't know what happens to them,"" he said. ""We shouldn't make policy based on the image of students going straight from high school to college, living on campus, and graduating four years later, when the majority of college students don't do that."" Currently, federal education statistics generally focus on first-time full-time students. But according to the report, about 4 of every 10 public college students attend part time -- and no more than a quarter of part-time students ever graduate. ""It's really, really hard to get your hands on completion rates for nontraditional students,"" said Judith Scott-Clayton, of the Community College Research Center at Teachers College. ""If somebody pops in and takes a community college class and they don't finish, you don't know whether they were ever planning to get a degree."" Among older students, as well as those who are awarded Pell grants, and black and Hispanic students, the report said, fewer than one in five of those attending college part time will earn a degree in six years.

""Time is the enemy of college completion,"" the report said. ""The longer it takes, the more life gets in the way of success."" One factor, Mr. Jones said, is the increasing practice of amassing more credits than are required for a degree. Another factor is the large number of students mired in noncredit remedial classes that the report calls the ""Bermuda Triangle"" of higher education. Half of all students studying for an associate degree, and one in five of those seeking a bachelor's degree -- including many who graduated from high school with a grade point average of 3.0 or higher, previous research has shown -- are required to take remedial, or ""developmental"" courses, and many of them never move on to credit-bearing courses, much less graduation. The report recommends that states adopt financing incentives to push colleges to pay more attention to completion rates. And it highlights strategies that have helped to increase graduation rates. Among those strategies are embedding remedial instruction in the curriculum, rather than requiring separate courses, and offering programs that students attend in a block, with a predictable schedule and a cohort of other students seeking the same credential. The report praises Tennessee's 27 Technology Centers, where the degree completion rate is 75 percent. Tech students, with an average age of 32, sign up for a program, not individual courses, and they come for seven hours a day, Monday through Friday, with classes ending by 3 p.m., allowing them to hold an evening job or care for their children after school. Instead of separate remedial courses, the centers have a required foundation course, in which each student learns skills needed for a program. ""A student might come in not knowing why they need to learn trigonometry, but when they're studying machine technology or drafting technology, they'll see why, and I think that helps,"" said Carol Puryear, director of the Tennessee Technology Center at Murfreesboro. ""Our mission is really work force development,"" she said, ""and about 85 percent of them get a job when they graduate.""","The group Complete College America cites factors like whether enrollment is full- or part-time, or at a two- or four-year institution.",7ca5d3f6-572e-5ebb-998a-5999b39d67be,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/27/us/REMEDIATION/REMEDIATION-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=367&w=600&s=f6ee65eca2b3c44f4c0466538df8b8bf8484e8000d5e2c1fde2ae899168b682d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Statistics on graduation rates for part-time or transfer students are largely invisible, a study by Complete College America says.",7ca5d3f6-572e-5ebb-998a-5999b39d67be,N24News/imgs/7ca5d3f6-572e-5ebb-998a-5999b39d67be.jpg,22
Science,"Length of Lashes Keeps Eyes From Drying, Study Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/25/science/length-of-lashes-keeps-eyes-from-drying-study-finds.html,"Long and luxurious eyelashes have been in fashion at least since Cleopatra. But scientists now suggest that their real function is to help protect eyes from drying out.

David Hu at the Georgia Institute of Technology first decided to investigate eyelashes after seeing his newborn daughter bat hers three years ago. He enlisted graduate students in his biomechanics lab and colleagues to join the investigation.

They measured the lashes of different mammals, most of which have them. They made an artificial eye with lashes, put it in a wind tunnel and blew air at it. And they created mathematical models of airflow over lashes.

They found that across a wide variety of mammals, eyelashes are always about one-third as long as the eye is wide, which, it turns out, is the ideal length for diverting airflow around the eye and reducing evaporation. Dr. Hu, Guillermo J. Amador and several other researchers, all from Georgia Tech, published their findings Tuesday in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface.","Researchers found that across a wide variety of mammals, eyelashes are always about one-third as long as the eye is wide, the ideal length for diverting airflow around the eye and reducing evaporation.",b3832f5d-cfe5-5305-9aaf-d93320c831b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/02/25/science/25lashes/25lashes-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=2ff6b103ef91098290c037a2686bf06822e64d5242e7e880ecda0597e331751d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Hu and other researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology measured the eyelashes of mammals and found that lashes are always about one-third as long as the eye is wide, the ideal length for diverting airflow around the eye and reducing evaporation.

Science,'2001: A Space Odyssey' Is Still the 'Ultimate Trip',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/10/science/2001-a-space-odyssey-kubrick.html,"The film ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" which is being rereleased this year for its 50th anniversary, baffled film critics when it first came out but now tops their lists of the most important movies of all time.Credit...Dmitri Kessel/The LIFE Picture Collection, via Getty Images



The film ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" which is being rereleased this year for its 50th anniversary, baffled film critics when it first came out but now tops their lists of the most important movies of all time.

In the spring of 1964 the filmmaker Stanley Kubrick was very worried. NASA was about to fly the Mariner 4 space probe past Mars. At the time he was deep in development of a blockbuster film about the discovery of alien intelligence. Word was that MGM had bet their studio on the film. What if Mariner discovered life on Mars and scooped them? Kubrick looked into whether he could buy insurance against that event. He could, but the price was astronomical. Kubrick decided to take his chances, according to a new book about the making of the movie, ""Space Odyssey, Stanley Kubrick, Arthur C. Clarke, and the Making of a Masterpiece,"" by Michael Benson. (Simon & Schuster 2018) That was 54 years ago. We still haven't discovered intelligence or even believable evidence of pond scum anywhere else in the universe -- not for lack of effort. A new spacecraft, TESS, designed to look for habitable nearby planets just vaulted into space, and an interstellar asteroid recently spotted streaking through the solar system was inspected for radio signals. Another robot is on its way to listen in on the heart of Mars. We still don't know if we are alone.

Mr. Kubrick's movie, ""2001, A Space Odyssey,"" finally debuted, late and over budget in April 1968, to baffled film critics and long lines of young people. John Lennon said he went to see it every week. It was the top-grossing movie of the year and is now a perennial on critics' lists of the most important movies of all time, often the first movie scientists mention if you ask them about sci-fi they have enjoyed. In honor of its 50th anniversary it is being rereleased at the Cannes Film Festival on Saturday and then in various cities around the world in a shiny new version overseen by Christopher Nolan, the director of ""Dunkirk"" and ""Inception,"" among other films. He told The Los Angeles Times the original film had been a ""touchstone"" from his childhood. The movie, written by Kubrick and Arthur C. Clarke (whose books and stories the movie was based on), and directed by Kubrick, is a multisensory ode to cosmic mystery, fate and the future. Long stretches happen with no explication or action except the zero-gravity ballets of spaceships immaculately imagined.

The story begins four million years ago in Africa, where a bunch of bedraggled primates are losing the battle of the survival of the fittest until a strange black monolith appears. To the thunder of ""Also Sprach Zarathustra,"" one of those apemen is inspired to pick up a bone and use it as a club to kill the animals that have been pushing him around. Suddenly, the apemen are eating meat and chasing their rivals away from the water hole. In a moment of exultation the ape throws the bone into the sky where, in what has been called the longest fast forward in film history, it turns into a spaceship. Around that toss Kubrick pivots his movie and all of human evolution. Another monolith appears on the moon, and yet another in orbit around Jupiter, where an astronaut named Dave Bowman connects with it after subduing a neurotic computer, the HAL 9000, which has murdered his shipmates. In the finale, Bowman is sent through a ""star gate"" on a trip through space and time, death and rebirth, returning as a glowing Star Child to float like a fetus over the Earth. I first saw ""2001"" in the spring of 1968 in the same pharmaceutically compromised condition that all my friends did. I didn't need that kind of help, anyway, having grown up reading Clarke's stories, in particular the novel ""Childhood's End"" and the short story, ""The Sentinel."" The last time I watched the movie (on VHS of all things on my tiny home television), was in 2000, on the eve of its eponymous year. I never realized how much I had missed until I read Mr. Benson's book, a deep, informative and entertaining dive into the making of the movie.

This is not a review of the book; Mr. Benson is a friend of mine, and I'm unabashedly ignorant of the history of cinema anyway. But it is a review of my own shifting attitudes and encounters with the movie itself over the years. One mark of the movie's status as a masterpiece is that it has something different to say to us every time we encounter it anew. Like the monolith it appears to give us what we need. Fifty years ago it was a harbinger of the future. We were about to win the race with the Russians to the moon. A whole generation was pumped and primed to tune in, turn on and transcend the whole dreary space-time continuum as we knew it. Thoroughly researched by Kubrick and Clarke, large swaths of the film were like a documentary of the future: the space station, the moon base, the grand-stepping outward just as Clarke and people like Wernher von Braun had prophesied. ""2001"" comes back at another poignant time in history, especially as it relates to space and the cosmos. Once we got to the moon, the script of future history was abandoned by the Nixon White House. It's now been 46 years since there was anyone on the moon. It's possible to imagine a time in which there will be no humans alive who have been there.

But now the traditional sci-fi script has flipped. A generation of swashbuckling billionaires has taken center stage in the space business, as well as a new class of wealthy customers who can afford to indulge their services. Instead of Star Child these days we have the ""Star Man,"" launched into orbit past Mars in a Tesla convertible by Elon Musk. I once wrote that I no longer expected bootprints on Mars in my lifetime. Now I'm not so sure. It's not crazy to think that private outfits like SpaceX, which seem to be running rings around NASA and Congress, could beat NASA into deeper space. I'd happily come out of retirement sometime in the 2030s to write the words that humans have landed and walked on Mars.

Not that NASA has credible plans or the prospect of enough money to go anywhere exciting anytime soon. Under its new administrator Jim Bridenstine, a former congressman, NASA is taking steps to move forward on a long-range program of exploration and survey of resources that would lead to the establishment of a permanent base there. But Mars is having a moment in the popular imagination -- from the Matt Damon film ""The Martian,"" which got high marks for scientific realism a couple years ago, to an upcoming television series ""The First,"" about settlers on Mars being planned by Beau Willimon, the producer and showrunner of the Netflix series ""House of Cards."" This week space leaders and enthusiasts gathered in Washington, D.C. for The Humans to Mars Summit, sponsored by the aerospace industry. The meeting featured the release of a report outlining how humans could be on Mars as early as 2033. Where the script has really flipped is in the future history of evolution. Robots have taken over the sacred task of exploring for us. Increasingly sophisticated and smaller machines have spread out to every world of the solar system, buzzing the rings of Saturn, daring the dark voids beyond Pluto and landing on comets, scanning the heavens for new planets, new places to dream about. There have been enough robots, landers and orbiters violating the skies and surface of Mars to spark legends and myths and paranoia among whatever life-forms might be there.

The next generation extending our telepresence across the universe will be even smaller and cleverer. Plans are afoot to send fleets of spaceships the size of iPhone chips toward Alpha Centauri, like clouds of butterflies across interstellar space. Even if our bodies don't ever cross the voids between the stars, our DNA surely will, in a microscopic cascade of space invaders that could still colonize the galaxy. We all carry HAL in our pockets now, and in a few years he, it, will be in our bloodstreams. The future, to the extent that humans are part of it, is bionic. Computers, to the delight of surveillance states and the despair of civil libertarians, can now recognize faces. For all we know neural networks like Deep Mind can dream. Worse, we may all be part of the dream. The news from some physicists like the late Stephen Hawking is that the universe might be a hologram, an illusion like the three-dimensional images on a bank card. Some cosmologists have argued that it is not inconsistent -- at least mathematically -- to imagine that the entire universe as we know it could just be a computer simulation, as in ""The Matrix"" -- another movie with long shadows. In effect, we are all made of bits, so the argument goes, removable, deformable at the click of an interstellar mouse. In that case, I have a bone or two to pick with the director.",The rerelease of Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece encourages us to reflect again on where we're coming from and where we're going.,d28ae150-6d2a-5054-8877-a33fbc95a795,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/15/science/15SCI-OUTTHERE1/15SCI-OUTTHERE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=41cb999c16d1df794f14d901f33a541906d7f8f23e85f17f4eab6c9c865881a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The film &ldquo;2001: A Space Odyssey,&rdquo; which is being rereleased this year for its 50th anniversary, baffled film critics when it first came out but now tops their lists of the most important movies of all time.",d28ae150-6d2a-5054-8877-a33fbc95a795,N24News/imgs/d28ae150-6d2a-5054-8877-a33fbc95a795.jpg,2
Global Business,Political Divide Poses Risks for Portugal in Bailout Talks,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/08/business/global/08euro.html,"LISBON -- Portugal's request for an international bailout puts European leaders in the difficult position of drafting a package of austerity measures and financial aid that will survive the country's caretaker government. European officials are hoping to avoid a repeat of the volatility that occurred in Ireland, where a new Irish government is now seeking to reopen its aid deal and alter the terms. Financial markets had anticipated Portugal's need for assistance as its costs of financing had risen to unsustainable levels, and investors generally shrugged off the news on Thursday. The European Central Bank, meanwhile, raised its benchmark interest rate for the first time since 2008, suggesting it was unworried about further economic deterioration and contagion among Europe's peripheral economies, including Spain. The latest European call for assistance, which is the third after the rescues of Greece and Ireland last year, comes amid a leadership vacuum in Portugal. The Socialist prime minister who requested the bailout, Jose Socrates, is leading a caretaker government until the general election on June 5. He resigned last month after center-right opposition lawmakers, led by the Social Democratic Party, rejected his austerity package.

Although opposition leaders agree on the need for a bailout, reaching consensus will not be easy. Tough austerity measures similar to those recently rejected will almost certainly be demanded by European lenders and, most likely, the International Monetary Fund. Portugal is already struggling with record unemployment and an economy that is expected to contract 1.3 percent this year, according to its central bank. ""From the point of view of being able to negotiate good terms for the Portuguese economy and display a firm commitment that might make the European Commission and the I.M.F. less demanding, this could not have happened at a worse time,"" said Pedro C. Magalhaes, a professor of politics at the University of Lisbon. Lisbon's request for aid also puts additional pressure on other ailing European economies, in particular Spain, which has undertaken austerity measures, a pension overhaul and a cleanup of its banking sector to stay out of danger. Any rescue request from Spain -- with an economy larger than that of Greece, Ireland and Portugal combined -- could put the European common currency project at risk. On Thursday, Spain held a successful bond auction, raising 4.1 billion euros ($5.8 billion) at a yield that was little changed from three months ago. Separately, France sold 9.49 billion euros in bonds Thursday, drawing strong demand. The Spanish sale ""confirms that there are no signs of a contagion spreading to Spain at present,"" said Chiara Cremonesi, a fixed-income strategist in London for UniCredit. ""Spain continues to be perceived by investors as part of the safer periphery countries group.""

In Lisbon, politicians from both sides are expected to meet in the coming days to work out details of their bailout package request. On Friday, Europe's monetary affairs commissioner said that preliminary estimates indicated that Portugal would need about 80 billion euros, or $114 billion, though some analysts have suggested that the amount could be as much as 110 billion euros. The commissioner, Olli Rehn, said, according to The Associated Press, that talks over a strict reforms program would start immediately with all major political parties and that it was essential for Portugal to reach a ""cross-party"" agreement.

The A.P. quoted Mr. Rehn as saying that he hoped a final deal will be in place by mid-May. The cabinet minister in the caretaker government, Pedro Silva Pereira, confirmed the formal rescue request, but would not comment on the amount of aid requested, saying that the next steps would be defined by the European Commission. Jean-Claude Trichet, president of the European Central Bank, said the bank had ""encouraged Portuguese authorities to ask for support."" If the pattern of previous bailouts is repeated, it could take several weeks for a team of Brussels officials to discuss the conditions of a bailout with Lisbon, which will ultimately need the approval of European finance ministers. The negotiations will occur in the midst of an election campaign that will probably be dominated by the question of who is to blame for Portugal's predicament. The Social Democratic leader, Pedro Passos Coelho, supported the decision to seek outside help, but he and Mr. Socrates are blaming each other for putting Portugal in a desperate situation. ""What the election campaign is now about is who should assume the responsibility for inviting international creditors into Portugal,"" said Diogo Ortigao Ramos, a partner at the law firm Cuatrecasas, Goncalves Pereira. Mr. Silva Pereira said Portugal's caretaker government had asked President Anibal Cavaco Silva to talk to the opposition parties. On Thursday, Mr. Cavaco Silva, in a Facebook message, called for ""responsible cooperation"" on the part of the opposition parties to help negotiate an acceptable deal.

Antonio Nogueira Leite, an economic adviser to the Social Democratic Party and a professor at the Nova School of Economics and Business in Lisbon, said, ""We have to learn from the mistakes in Greece and Ireland and be able to argue for a different treatment, but obviously our room to maneuver has been diminished because we have postponed our call for help for much longer than we should have."" Portugal's muddled political situation also raises ""problems of legal uncertainty,"" notably over whether a dissolved Parliament could approve a rescue agreement, Mr. Magalhaes, the politics professor, said. A new government is unlikely to take office before the end of June, with Portugal's most recent opinion polls suggesting that the June vote could result in a hung Parliament. Short-term needs must also be resolved. Portugal faces a bond redemption of 4.3 billion euros on April 15. Some officials suspect Portugal might need to seek bilateral loans from other countries to tide it over. Others say the announcement of the aid request on Wednesday might drive down the cost of short-term borrowing for Portugal and avert a problem. Portugal is now embarking on what will be its third international bailout since returning to democracy in the 1970s, with previous interventions by the I.M.F. in 1978 and 1983. This time, however, ""the sense of punishment will be much stronger because the expectations of citizens are much higher than three decades ago, when Portugal was not even in the E.U.,"" said Antonio Vitorino, who was in the Portuguese government that negotiated the 1983 rescue and a former European commissioner. In 1983, Mr. Vitorino noted, Portugal was able to revive an export-led recovery by significantly devaluing its currency -- no longer an option under euro membership. ""The money injection that we received had a much stronger short-term effect on our economy than it could have this time,"" he said.",Leaders in Lisbon will begin setting aside their domestic differences in order to negotiate with creditors.,27cf239d-4866-57b9-9c50-37eb1ef9c11d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/04/08/business/global/08euro-span/08euro-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=ec39f74e7e7498d86220f0cd233498ee00ffbf9cd62d8d05279a7b2adf624fb5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,A pedestrian in front of a closed jewelry store in Lisbon on Thursday.

Opinion,"Coronavirus Gloom, and Rays of Hope",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/opinion/letters/covid-gloom-hope.html,"Eight months into the pandemic, I have been pondering the American public's response to it. My country has lost its soul. For the country to refuse to take all measures to face this virus head on is tantamount to my parents' generation deciding eight months into World War II that it was tired of all the sacrifice called for and insisting that we just declare a great victory and go home.

Our greatest strength was our determination to face adversity together and endure. Is that lost on us now?

Re ""Holidays Must Look Different This Year"" (editorial, Oct. 30):

Urging Americans to stay home this holiday season to mitigate further spread of Covid-19 makes total sense. And as you note, Zoom gatherings might ""help keep families connected"" and preserve some of the traditions.

As Thanksgiving approaches, I would go one step further and suggest that Zoom might even help preserve family harmony. Traditional holiday dinners can be fraught with strife. Think of the frantic food shopping added to a busy work schedule; the festering resentments that can surface among adult siblings; the critical eye recording who brought Costco as opposed to cooking from scratch; or the thought of getting stuck next to your least favorite relative, who is still asking if you have found a job or when you are going to start a family.

From a distance, frictions might dissipate. Unlike so many families that have been torn apart by loss this year, all of us might just get to relax and to appreciate the simple fact that we are all still together -- muting and unmuting, but survivors in a year that has been extremely difficult for just about everyone.","Readers discuss the vaccine news, America's soul, Thanksgiving by Zoom and low-income college dropouts.",1a807b3b-4f9f-50c9-a5d7-c96abe9c4d21,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/10/world/10virus-briefing-cdc-mask1/merlin_179661732_aa120bba-8735-433a-91a4-cfda1b0541e7-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e41c3f9b2b8485e7e7c13d2448de1277fb017dd197178bb197007baeda2e69b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A market in Columbus, Ohio, offering food for those in need.

Fashion & Style,Open Thread: This Week in Style News,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/15/fashion/open-thread-style-newsletter-fashion-week-packing.html,"Each week, the Open Thread newsletter will offer a look from across The New York Times at the forces that shape the dress codes we share, with Vanessa Friedman as your personal shopper. The latest newsletter appears here. To receive it in your inbox, register here. One down, three to go. Fashion weeks, that is. New York has finally come to a close -- for the highlights, read this -- and I am off to London, Milan and Paris with the rest of the fashion flock. You know what that means: packing time! How to plan for two seasons, three countries, 18 days away and dawn-to-dinner (and beyond) events is just the beginning of the issue. Then there's comfort, cobblestones and climate to consider. But while this is a fashion itinerary, it's not a fashion-specific challenge, so I thought I would let you in on what I call my cheater's guide to a travel wardrobe: no tissue paper or ironing involved. Remember when Donna Karan came up with her seven easy pieces? Well, these are my six: 1. Black pants. They are the equivalent of furniture. No one remembers them, so one pair with different tops can get you very far. I have a neoprene version by Schumacher that feels as comfortable as leggings, so they are good for the plane, but have enough give so they can fake it as a tux with a black jacket if necessary.

2. A sleeveless knit dress -- or three. They do not wrinkle, so ironing isn't an issue, and you can layer a bodysuit beneath if it gets cold. (When I am trying to use up time in the airport I go to Duty Free and buy Wolford bodies.) 3. A vest. Ideally, a shearling one. For years, I did not understand the point of that garment. Now I don't leave home in september without it. It's more versatile than a jacket, and takes up less space. 4. Ankle boots. They give you the support you need to walk all over city streets, keep your feet warm and work equally well with jeans and cocktail dresses. The Tod's version is expensive, but I think the investment is worth it, because even though the heels are high, the rubber sole means that they are weirdly comfortable. 5. A few small, zippable pouches. During the year I have one that houses all my foreign plugs and one that I use for invites and notebooks, and when I have to pack I just throw them into my suitcase. On the road I use them to keep stuff organized in my otherwise totally disorganized giant handbag, and then if I have to go to a party, I use one as a pretend-clutch. 6. An extra bag. After years of trying to fit everything into one suitcase, I decided that having the room to add a few extra items in order to lessen my preflight decision-making stress, as well as to accommodate the presents I know I will end up buying my family, is worth the money it costs for the extra bag. Plus you will never be in that embarrassing position of having to unpack your suitcase in front of the entire check-in desk in order to transfer its contents to your carry-on and avoid overweight charges.

Meanwhile, to get you in the mood for what's to come, spend some time listening in on this hysterical conversation between the shoe guru Manolo Blahnik and the journalist, illustrator and director Michael Roberts, who just made a documentary together; find out how Gucci made nice with Dapper Dan; and spend 48 hours with Carolina Herrera. Talk to you from across the pond! Every week on Open Thread, Vanessa will answer a reader's fashion-related question, which you can send to her anytime via email or Twitter. Questions are edited and condensed. Q: Why has the cost of clothes, accessories, handbags and shoes increased so much, considerably out of proportion to other items we consume? I started buying designer clothing in the '90s and got hooked on the workmanship, the fabrics, the fit, the feel and the compliments that came my way, but I am astounded at prices that now force me to buy rarely and always at a discount. Does this strategy really pay off? -- Jennifer Brooks Morris A: First, it's important to realize that a designer item and a consumer good are actually two entirely different things (they are even differentiated on the stock market), so you can't judge the former by the standards of the latter. More specifically, the answer depends on who you ask. Brands would say the increases reflect the cost of the raw materials, which are often rare; the handiwork that goes into the products and the value of the artisans; the cost of currency hedging; import/export duties; and so on. That may be true, but the price structure also reflects the completely unquantifiable aura necessary for a product to qualify as ""luxury"" -- and the age-old theory that you always want what you cannot get. As for whether the strategy works, I think the answer, judging by the recent annual results of giant groups such as LVMH and Kering, which reported record profits, would be: unfortunately, yes. -- VANESSA FRIEDMAN","Who to watch for at London Fashion Week, highlights from New York — and much more.",496fe75f-11aa-5ebd-9975-607c2bdc8ca9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/14/t-magazine/fashion/14tmag-nyfw-best-of-slide-65LU-copy/14tmag-nyfw-best-of-slide-65LU-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=abf831224773234b1aa07064b62a2bdf34fdfd973ff6f6f729ca939d1bfbfded&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Goodbye New York, Hello London!

Real Estate,House Hunting in … Turkey,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/realestate/house-hunting-in-turkey.html,"This five-bedroom property occupies a 1.25-acre plot of land in Yalikavak, a town on the Bodrum Peninsula in southwestern Turkey, about two miles from the Aegean Sea. It is 10 miles northwest of Bodrum, the Turkish port city known for its beaches, boating and historical ruins. Completed in 2012, the property includes a two-bedroom villa, a three-bedroom guesthouse and a one-bedroom staff house, as well as a large swimming pool and several covered terraces with views of the Aegean coast. The houses were built out of steel-reinforced concrete and adorned with local stone, giving them a traditional Turkish Aegean aesthetic. The interiors have wood-framed windows, rustic stone walls, oak and tile floors, and hefty oak ceiling beams. A long driveway leads past the staff quarters to a graveled parking area. The front door of the approximately 3,230-square-foot main house opens to a dining area adjacent to the kitchen. To the right is a living room with built-in oak bookshelves, a fireplace and a cozy seating area facing the sea. The kitchen, to the left of the dining area, has Turkish tile floors, chestnut cabinets and chestnut-framed French doors opening to expansive terraces and al fresco dining spaces. A stairway adjacent to the main house leads to the property's guest quarters, with the Aegean Sea in the distance. Upstairs, the master suite has an large arched window, a spacious bathroom and a private balcony with water views. The second en suite bedroom downstairs is typically used by guests, said Heike Tanbay, managing director of Engel & Volkers Bodrum, which has the listing. The home's furnishings and decorations, a mix of antiques and Turkish textiles, are included in the asking price (excluding certain collectibles).

The guesthouse is approximately 2,150 square feet, with three en suite bedrooms connected by an outdoor courtyard, and a painting studio with sweeping water views in the building's tower. Behind the houses, a stone staircase descends to a 56-foot pool and surrounding stone patio. A walkway leads to a bathroom, a sitting area and a fitness room in the garden level of the main house. The landscaped grounds include tangerine and jacaranda trees, and offer several covered lounging areas. The one-bedroom staff cottage is roughly 750 square feet and is currently shared by two caretakers, a couple whose employment could continue, Ms. Tanbay said. The property is in a sparsely developed residential neighborhood in the coastal resort town of Yalikavak, which has a population of about 13,000. Yalikavak Bay, five minutes away by car, has a popular marina that caters to yachts and offers shopping and dining. Bodrum, in the province of Mugla, is about a half-hour drive; the port city, which has a population of about 40,000, is known for its seaside resorts and links to ancient history, including the ruins of the Mausoleum of Mausolus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. Milas-Bodrum Airport is about 30 miles northeast, and the Greek island of Kos is a 50-minute ferry ride away.

The peninsula has two focal points, agents said. The city of Bodrum is seen as increasingly desirable by younger Turks, said Cameron Deggin, the managing director of Property Turkey, a real estate agency in Bodrum. Some work remotely or fly to Istanbul, about 400 miles north, a few days a week. Yalikavak, on the peninsula's western side, lures tourists and buyers with its beaches, resorts, shopping and upscale marina. Although housing prices across Turkey fell overall in 2018, due in part to the decline of the Turkish lira, Bodrum's high-end market resisted the trend thanks to sustained international demand, Ms. Tanbay said. Still, the volume of luxury transactions fell slightly, with foreign buyers only partly compensating for the drop in Turkish buyers. Luxury homes on the peninsula typically start at about 1.5 million euros (or $1.7 million), Ms. Tanbay said, but ""if you have access to the sea, then prices literally double."" Bodrum is also seeing new, more affordable luxury developments, Mr. Ertukel said, with two- and three-bedroom condominiums on the waterfront starting at around 440,000 euros ($500,000).

International buyers have been emboldened by the recent elimination of the value-added tax paid by foreigners on newly built homes, agents said. Another incentive is a change to the country's citizenship-by-investment program, which loosened the requirements from investing $1 million in real estate to investing $250,000. ""Our inquiries have tripled over the last three months, especially the Istanbul market,"" Mr. Ertukel said. Ms. Tanbay, however, said she believes the program's effect will be limited, particularly in Bodrum. Mr. Deggin and other agents said Turkey's increasingly autocratic government does not seem to have been a concern for many foreign buyers. ""They are not put off at all,"" he said of his clients. Despite a recent surge in international interest, Bodrum is still known as a weekend or holiday destination for wealthy Turks, and agents said the vast majority of buyers are Turkish -- among them, those who currently live in the country, expatriates returning from abroad and couples that include one Turkish citizen. ""The money is Turkish money in Bodrum,"" Mr. Deggin said. Most foreign buyers come from France, Canada, Britain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, the United States, Norway, Sweden and Denmark. But in the past five years or so, more buyers have been coming from Middle Eastern countries like Qatar, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon, agents said. Purchases of real estate by citizens of certain countries, including the United States, are restricted by the Turkish government, said Gonenc Gurkaynak, the founding partner of ELIG Gurkaynak Attorneys-at-Law, in Istanbul.

Sports,2020 French Open: What to Watch on Wednesday,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/07/sports/tennis/french-open-what-to-watch.html,"How to watch: 6 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. on the Tennis Channel; streaming on the Tennis Channel app. As all four singles matches move to the covered stage of Philippe Chatrier Court, the players have more protection from the sour, chilly weather that has dogged Paris over the past couple weeks. Now, the second day of quarterfinals features some familiar champions and some players who do not usually go this deep in major tournaments. Here are some matches to keep an eye on. Because of the number of matches cycling through courts, the times for individual matchups are at best a guess and are certain to fluctuate based on the times at which earlier play is completed. All times are Eastern. Sofia Kenin, the Australian Open champion, is the highest seed remaining in the women's singles draw. Although she has been pushed to three sets in most of her matches through the first four rounds, there has been little sense that she was ever beaten or unsure of how to pull herself out of tough situations. This assuredness will serve her well as the stakes rise. Kenin is a favorite to win it all, and only one other player left in the draw has reached a Grand Slam tournament final.

Danielle Collins, who played her round of 16 match against Ons Jabeur on Tuesday because of a rain delay, is in a Grand Slam singles tournament for the 12th time. Aside from her trip to the semifinals at the 2019 Australian Open, she had always lost within the first week of a Grand Slam, often in the first round. Now, at Roland Garros, she has made her way to her second major quarterfinal. With a physical three-set match behind her, Collins will have a hard time digging in, as Kenin will push her on the defensive. Collins will need to try to out-hit Kenin from the start, because if this match goes to three sets, Collins will surely be at a distinct disadvantage. Collins has beaten Kenin in their three previous meetings, but they were all on hardcourts. Andrey Rublev and Stefanos Tsitsipas will meet for the second time since the start of this year's French Open. On the Sunday that the French Open began, Rublev beat Tsitsipas in the final of the German Open in Hamburg in a thrilling three-set match. Now, a week and a half later, they meet for the fourth time in their careers. Rublev, the 13th seed, has now reached his second straight Grand Slam quarterfinal. The offensive baseliner has a powerful forehand, which he hits almost exclusively in an open stance, even when not on the run. The wiry young Russian defies conventional understanding of how to power through the ball, as tennis has embraced open stances mainly as a way to recover to the center of the court more quickly. Tsitsipas, the fifth seed, won the ATP Finals in 2019, but has a tendency to be inconsistent in Grand Slams. Although he reached his first Grand Slam semifinal at the Australian Open in 2019, he crashed out of Wimbledon and the United States Open in the first round last year. This is his first major quarterfinal since then, and Tsitsipas now faces the task of trying to outlast a player whom he has only beaten at the Next Gen ATP Finals in 2018.

Both players are offensive-minded, which on red clay can lead to over-hitting and unforced errors. Whichever player can keep himself in check is likely to be able to outlast his opponent. Petra Kvitova, a two-time Wimbledon champion, has not thrived on the French Open clay through her career. She was a semifinalist at Roland Garros in 2016, during arguably her best year on tour, but that was the only time she had previously made it past the round of 16. Now, with a relatively easy draw, she has yet to drop a set on the way to the quarterfinals. Kvitova tends to enjoy faster surfaces that complement her fast serves and flattened groundstrokes. Although clay can slow down these shots, this year's clay has allowed the ball to skid more than usual, much to Kvitova's enjoyment. Laura Siegemund, a doubles specialist who won the U.S. Open this year with her partner, Vera Zvonareva, is having a breakout performance at this year's French Open. In 2016, she reached the third round of both hardcourt majors, but has never been past the second round of a major since. Siegemund has used her crafty, angled shots to trouble opponents, but her run will probably be put to bed by the powerful groundstrokes of Kvitova. Novak Djokovic, the top seed, has waltzed to the French Open quarterfinal. Even as Karen Khachanov tried to overwhelm Djokovic in the round of 16, he seemed unflappable. Without having lost a set, Djokovic is now matching up against his last opponent from the U.S. Open, Pablo Carreno Busta. Carreno Busta, the 17th seed, reached the semifinal of the U.S. Open and was the reluctant beneficiary when Djokovic was disqualified for hitting a tennis ball that inadvertently nailed a line judge in the throat. Carreno Busta took full advantage of the disqualification, going on to beat Denis Shapavolov in five sets, and then barely losing to Alexander Zverev in five sets as well. In the first set between Carreno Busta and Djokovic at the U.S. Open, it was Carreno Busta who seemed to be in control of the match. Now, on his favored surface of red clay, the Spaniard may have a chance to prove that he could have won that match on his own merits.","Novak Djokovic and Sofia Kenin, the Australian Open champions, look to advance to the French Open semifinals against familiar opposition.",94949ff6-1dcd-51c4-ad47-26b13023164e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/07/sports/07french-watch01/07french-watch01-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5159eeadd9c2472c592575f5e3bab68a5167eb2a9e0226207e9e69ae1daea9e6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sofia Kenin faces Danielle Collins in a French Open quarterfinal on Wednesday.,94949ff6-1dcd-51c4-ad47-26b13023164e,N24News/imgs/94949ff6-1dcd-51c4-ad47-26b13023164e.jpg,9
Style,Surviving Fashion's Summer From Hell,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/19/style/fashion-retail-surviving-fashions-summer-from-hell.html,"In late April, Amy Smilovic began streaming live from the Instagram account of her fashion label, Tibi. About once a week, she and Dione Davis, her styling director, would put on Tibi outfits and talk -- easily, authoritatively -- about how the clothes made them feel. ""When you feel good about the outfit that you've put on, your confidence just can go through the roof,"" Ms. Smilovic said in one early episode, after Ms. Davis modeled a pair of tailored bloomers. In the same session she wryly compared her pandemic state to a ""walking pharmaceutical commercial"" whose list of symptoms included crying in the shower and sending emails at 4 a.m. Ms. Smilovic believed a good outfit could help with that too. Tibi designs clothing for ""creative pragmatists,"" a term Ms. Smilovic, 52, coined late last year to describe a style she had long struggled to describe. The look is about balance -- being modern but not edgy, she says, and chill but not bohemian. As she once advised on Instagram, where she also occasionally ribs Lululemon moms, Bravo stars and yogurt-straining yogis: ""when u dress interesting u will feel interesting."" From a design perspective, this usually means adding unusual twists to familiar closet staples: an oversize blazer with slits at the elbows; jeans that look as if they're being worn backward; a crew-neck sweater with rounded shoulder pads. Ms. Davis called the weird accents ""Tibi Easter eggs.""

As the summer continued, the styling sessions evolved. Instagram Live had become a popular feature in the pandemic as people (or brands, mostly) sought new ways to connect with homebound followers. At the beginning, Ms. Smilovic and Ms. Davis streamed from their homes, splitting the screen in half. When they were allowed to return to their SoHo storefront and Wall Street office, the live sessions became more polished (but not too polished), eventually overseen by a filmmaker on staff. By September, viewership had grown from about 5,000 to 20,000. Some of the products featured were selling out online within days, they said. Elaine Chang, the president of Tibi, had a theory about why the videos were resonating: ""When all of us were consumed by 24/7 fight-or-flight mode, being able to share in Amy's conversations about fashion and what it means for people reminded us of human potential,"" she said. ""There is a light at the end of the tunnel."" The good news was that Tibi's customer base was growing, with Instagram now driving 10 to 15 percent of all sales, the company said. The bad news was that the world was still a catastrophe. There was no tiptoeing into this summer of hell -- a season marked by widespread illness and staggering death tolls, police brutality and mass protests. Unemployment spiked. Industries collapsed. Sales at clothing and accessories stores dropped more than 50 percent.

One day Ms. Smilovic was jetting off to Paris Fashion Week, her label on track to pull in $55 to $60 million in sales in 2020. Three weeks later, she was laying off 44 people -- more than half of her company -- and cutting salaries for the rest. ""I describe this time right now for all of us as 'baptism by fire,'"" Ms. Smilovic told her remaining employees in an email this spring, calling the pandemic ""a crash course in economics."" But it wasn't clear then, or even now, when the fire might stop. Ms. Smilovic founded Tibi in 1997 after moving from New York to Hong Kong with her husband, Frank. She had previously been a marketing manager at American Express (where she met Frank). With no training in fashion, she and a friend started out making clothing for fellow expats. In 2000, the Smilovics moved back to the United States and established Tibi in Manhattan. They are the sole owners of their company; in addition to the SoHo store, they have an outlet and warehouse in coastal Georgia, where Ms. Smilovic was raised, and where her mother works part-time.

""She gets in the dressing room with them, tucking and untucking and scrunching up sleeves,"" Ms. McMullen said. ""She does it with such ease that women feel connected to her, like they know her."" Beginning in late March, weeks went by without payments from some of Tibi's stores, Ms. Smilovic said. When the layoffs came, the only team Tibi kept intact was finance, which scrambled to secure government support, renegotiate bills and rent -- Ms. Smilovic's single biggest source of stress at the time -- and rigidly monitor cash flow amid the wave of bankruptcies and order cancellations. She spent April crunching numbers, ""gripped with fear,"" she said. In May, when some stores and offices reopened, that fear ebbed slightly. She'd signed a fashion-industry open letter calling for a more sensible seasonal shopping calendar. She felt good that Tibi had donated 1,300 pieces of clothing to front-line workers. She was also inspired to work on Tibi's internal stylebook, articulating the rules for the creative pragmatist's wardrobe, which she'd been sharing during the live styling sessions and on her own blunt Instagram account. Like: The best pieces can adapt from work to home to evening to weekend. A good outfit has three textures. Don't match your shoes to your top. Don't wear skinny jeans with stilettos. ""It's showing people who we are,"" she said on a Zoom call in May. ""I don't know where or how it will pay off, but it feels like the right thing to do."" Then, on May 25, George Floyd was killed by police in Minneapolis, catalyzing Black Lives Matter protests across the country. Some of those reopened stores closed again, boarding up windows to prevent vandalism.

On social media, Ms. Smilovic is far more candid than most creative directors in fashion. But during that first weekend of protests, she hesitated. She felt traumatized by what she was seeing on TV, she said, and wanted to wait until Monday, when she could talk to her team. Nine of Tibi's 43 employees are Black. Then, early that Monday, Ms. Smilovic learned the Tibi store had been robbed while a protest unfolded near SoHo, its front window smashed in with a crowbar. She left her home in Greenwich, Conn., to survey the damage. ""I thought that when I drove up, I would be filled with rage or anger,"" she said. Instead, it felt more surreal and sad. She posted a picture of the window to Instagram with the words ""I'm processing."" The immediate comments were largely sympathetic, which made Ms. Smilovic feel uncomfortable. ""I was the last person in the world that needed to be consoled,"" she said. A handful of people left critical comments, too, about how Black lives mattered more than clothing. Ms. Smilovic deleted the photo. In a statement she made after gathering her thoughts and talking to Black colleagues and friends in fashion, including Ms. McMullen, she promised to devote space in Tibi's SoHo store to a rotation of young Black designers.

""The supply side is hurt. The demand side is hurt. My God, the last week and a half on top of it. At least before, there was an enemy that we could all acknowledge and fight. The enemy right now is just breaking people apart."" Though far from bubbly, Ms. Smilovic isn't a pessimist, and as the summer dragged on, she began seeing some silver linings in Tibi's sales. A pair of $395 nylon joggers developed a cult following, selling out during the first run of 110 pieces, she said. Sellouts were happening with some regularity, now that factory production had been reduced -- cut in half at the start of the pandemic -- and the live styling sessions were catching on. August's online sales were 30 percent higher than the same month last year. ""To be honest, I think people are understanding our brand better,"" Ms. Smilovic said. It was a feeling she'd been chasing for a decade. Tibi had a different look in its first 13 years, one largely built around pretty party dresses with no strange accents or androgynous silhouettes. Ms. Smilovic grew to hate those looks. ""I was so sick and tired of not being proud of my brand,"" she said. So in 2010 she decided Tibi would modernize to align with her own taste. A few employees weren't on board and left. But the biggest skeptics were the retailers selling the line, like department stores that had decided Tibi was their ""prints brand.""

The new (mostly printless) Tibi was harder to categorize. It didn't help that the brand had never been embraced by the fashion guard, which Ms. Smilovic has often attributed to fashion's warped gender dynamics. In a business dominated by women, she said, there aren't very many women designers at the top, and even fewer praised in the pages of Vogue. ""If you were a woman, it seems you either have to be a socialite -- Rosetta Getty, Gabriela Hearst, Tory Burch, with a serious last name -- or maybe a movie star,"" she said. ""I don't say that to take away from the Olsens. I really like the Row. But are any of the top male designers in America socialites or movie stars? No, they all kind of made it on their own."" One unforeseen consequence of the pandemic is that Tibi has been freed from some of its more toxic wholesale relationships, like with stores that ghosted on payments, or with companies that proposed paying the money they owed via payment plans as long as one year. (Ms. Smilovic said no.) And don't get her started on ""exclusive styles,"" which is when a store requests tweaks to existing items, like a skirt with a shorter hem. Sometimes the end result wouldn't look like Tibi at all. Ms. Smilovic gritted her teeth and made them anyway. ""I would take the money, but it would tug at me,"" she said. Not anymore. When orders like those are produced and then canceled, it doesn't mean just a potential six-figure loss. It means being stuck with clothing she didn't like and didn't want to sell on her own site -- not after working so hard to refine Tibi's aesthetic. ""It turns into this weird David and Goliath situation, where the stores are really just threatening the solvency of your business,"" she said.

Cutting corners has helped. Recently Ms. Smilovic hosted a summer-camp-themed photo shoot for the spring 2021 campaign at her house, complete with a D.I.Y. set and her home cooking as catering. Frank, her husband, has been ""sweeping up crumbs,"" she said, like disconnecting unused company phone lines belonging to laid-off employees, saving thousands. But there is tension, she said, when one-third of the company (finance) is devoted to making sure the other two-thirds (product and sales) don't spend money. Full salaries have yet to be restored. Tibi will likely end the year $2 million to $3 million away from breaking even, making this the first year Ms. Smilovic has had a loss, she said. But there is still a sense of hope that she can get Tibi back on track. A new track -- the old one isn't an option anymore. ""She's in a position today to pull back and do what she believes,"" said Robert Burke, whose luxury consultancy firm helped with Tibi's rebrand years ago. ""She probably will have a more profitable $10 million business than her old $30 million business."" In August, sitting in her somewhat disorderly office, Ms. Smilovic was musing on what she wanted to wear in the future: pieces that act like attachments, turning existing garments into something entirely new, like a giant asymmetrical collar layered over a sweatshirt. The ability to transform something quickly has never been more important to her. ""I feel so much better,"" she said. ""Before, you were so focused on pulling yourself back up so you could bring back the team and be what you were. And now there's no notion of that in our heads. This is what we are now.""","Tibi is giving pandemic-era lessons in personal style, and finding new paths forward for its business.",91a406e5-da8d-5d29-8b36-a98c5d032f93,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/fashion/18TIBI-1/18TIBI-1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=0744f27276fd0a8ae2f4826dd6ce06b0743d516158e2dcd45931c3ec421e3e74&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Amy Smilovic, the Tibi founder, found a way to navigate the economic crisis.",91a406e5-da8d-5d29-8b36-a98c5d032f93,N24News/imgs/91a406e5-da8d-5d29-8b36-a98c5d032f93.jpg,15

Food,Today Is for Nachos,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/14/dining/today-is-for-nachos.html,"Good morning. How are you? You getting enough sleep, or sleeping all the time? You eating enough, not enough, too much? How's your stress level? You feeling optimistic? Or the opposite? I watched the sun rise the other morning and asked myself those questions. I found I could not answer them. And I can't be alone in that. We're caught in the continuum between what was and what will be, and it's dizzying. We're all in, all the time.

What I know we can do: shrug and head into the kitchen. It's different in there, or it can be. We can enter unsure of ourselves and the state of the world, assemble an array of ingredients and then put them together into something that brings pleasure both in the making and the consumption, and that's not nothing. That's healthy.

That's nachos, for me. I love Priya Krishna's version, Indian-ish nachos (above) that she makes with her mother, Ritu, with cilantro chutney, tamarind drizzle and chhonk, a sauce of melted ghee, cumin seeds and red chile. I love my own game-day nachos as well, and have come around strongly to Mark Bittman's Greek-style version, too. Loaded nachos? Short-rib chili nachos? On a Monday night in the midst of a pandemic, with the West on fire and an important election looming, nachos are a kind of tranquilizer, good for the soul.

Media,Associated Press Denies Cooperating With Nazis,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/31/business/media/associated-press-nazis.html,"A German historian said in new research that The Associated Press, the international news organization based in New York, formally cooperated with Nazi Germany in the 1930s, including the employment of a photographer who worked for a Nazi propaganda division.

The research by Harriet Scharnberg, of Martin Luther University, argued that The A.P. was complicit in allowing the Nazis to ""portray a war of extermination as a conventional war."" Her research was reported Wednesday in The Guardian.

The Nazi regime cracked down on local and international press with a restrictive law in 1933, but The A.P. was able to report in Germany until 1941, when the United States joined the war. In a statement, The A.P. said that until Ms. Scharnberg's research, it ""had no knowledge of any accusation that material may have been directly produced and selected by Nazi propaganda ministries.""

""A.P. rejects the suggestion that it collaborated with the Nazi regime at any time,"" the company said. ""Rather, The A.P. was subjected to pressure from the Nazi regime from the period of Hitler's coming to power in 1932 until the A.P.'s expulsion from Germany in 1941.

Science,"Denim, as a Crime-Solving Tool, Has Holes",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/science/denim-pattern-matching-forensic-crime.html,"In 1997, Charles Barbee and three co-defendants were convicted of robbing two banks in Spokane, Wash., and setting off bombs in the office of a local newspaper and a Planned Parenthood clinic. One key piece of evidence from the trial was a security-camera photo that showed an alternating dark-and-light pattern along a seam of one of the robber's bluejeans. Richard Vorder Bruegge, an F.B.I. forensic scientist, told the jury that the visual features of the jeans in the photograph, particularly the dark-and-light ""bar code"" pattern, matched a pair that had been seized from the house of one of the suspects: Charles Barbee. The next year, Dr. Vorder Bruegge published a study on the Barbee case in the Journal of Forensic Sciences, which was used to set a legal precedent for how analysis of patterns in photographs could be used as evidence. Analysis of visual elements in photographs, such as facial markings, design features on clothing and jeans bar codes, is used in hundreds of cases a year, F.B.I. officials have said. But a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences raises questions about the trustworthiness of matching jeans by their patterns of wear. ""Even under ideal conditions, trying to get an exact match is difficult,"" said Hany Farid, a computer scientist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the senior author of the study. ""This technique should be used with extreme caution, if at all.""

Dr. Farid has spent most of his career studying the forensics of digital images, and has testified in court about whether images were digitally altered. After reading an investigation by Ryan Gabrielson of ProPublica last year, he was inspired to look into photo analysis techniques used by the F.B.I. Much of the scientific heft undergirding those techniques stemmed from the one study on jeans bar codes, Mr. Gabrielson wrote. Dr. Farid set out to test the technique. He and Sophie Nightingale, a postdoctoral researcher, bought 100 pairs of jeans from thrift stores in Berkeley and took a photo of each long, vertical seam. They also had 111 workers, found through the crowdsourcing site Amazon Mechanical Turk, send in similar pictures of their own jeans. These images would be used to measure the range of differences between different jeans. To simulate the variation that arises when photographing the same jeans, they chose 10 pairs whose seams all had pronounced dark-and-light patterns and took 10 photos of each seam under varied conditions: in different rooms in their lab, with different lighting, using different cameras and placing the jeans on different surfaces. Dr. Farid and Dr. Nightingale plotted each dark-and-light pattern on a line graph; the light portions of the seam were represented by peaks, and the dark portions were represented by valleys. They then sought to compare the graphs to each other. Ideally, this comparison would show that two images of the same seam are much more similar than two images of different seams. This, in turn, would support the idea that the bar code for each seam is truly unique, and that a photo reliably captures that uniqueness.

To make the comparison easier, they adapted a mathematical tool that neuroscientists use to measure the similarity between different ""spike trains,"" a phenomenon in which brain cells are mostly silent, then fire suddenly. Dr. Farid and Dr. Nightingale transformed the jeans graphs to look more like spike trains, with narrow, pointy peaks and valleys, and then used the spike-train tool to compare them. The data showed that two images of the same seam often looked quite different -- so much so that it was often impossible to tell whether a pair of images were of the same seam or different ones. Much of the problem, the researchers concluded, comes down to the fact that cloth is flexible: it stretches, folds and drapes in complicated ways, which changes how it looks in photos. The lack of distinctiveness in images of seams significantly limits the accuracy of jeans identification, according to the study. The algorithm made a significant number of false matches between different pairs of jeans. The authors found that if they made the algorithm more discriminating, limiting the odds of making a false match to one in a million -- 0.0001 percent -- then the chances of making a correct match were only about 20 percent. The rest of the time, the algorithm would not make any match. If they were less picky about accuracy, they could obtain correct matches about 80 percent of the time -- but they would also get about 20 percent false matches. Alicia Carriquiry, a statistician at Iowa State University and director of a program on forensic science, who was not involved with the study, said the most important goal for any forensic technique is to have a low likelihood of false matches. False matches can lead to innocent people being convicted of crimes that they did not commit. ""In the jeans study, that probability was huge, meaning that the chance of making a false identification using that evidence is high,"" she said. Dr. Farid said the study actually represented a best-case scenario, in which the jeans were photographed from up close, under bright lighting and with good cameras. In real investigations, suspects are often photographed at distance, with low-resolution CCTV cameras.

Researchers outside the F.B.I. posit that the Journal of Forensic Sciences article also failed to show that jeans bar codes were a reliable method of identification. The major problem, they say, was that the article did not include an objective statistical model of how likely it was for the method to make mistakes -- to gauge the possibility that two different pairs of jeans might look the same because of manufacturing similarities or just by coincidence, for instance. Instead the study leaned on the analyst's judgment of markings on jeans. Dr. Vorder Bruegge pointed this out himself in the study: ""It should be remembered that in this and other cases, the overall significance of wear marks is not necessarily based on a quantitative assessment, but on a qualitative assessment."" During the trial of Mr. Barbee, Dr. Vorder Bruegge demonstrated the accuracy of the technique by explaining that one pair of jeans seized from Mr. Barbee matched the pair worn by the bank robber, while 34 other pairs of jeans offered up by the defense did not. But outside researchers say that method does not substitute for having a statistical model describing the method's accuracy. In fact, at four points in the article, Dr. Vorder Bruegge noted that the technique had yet to be statistically validated. ""Although a validation study has yet to be performed to test the theory that all denim trouser bar code seam patterns are unique,"" he wrote, ""it has been observed in numerous examinations that it is possible to distinguish pairs of jeans from one another based solely on differences in the patterns along the seams."" No such validation study has been published since then. The F.B.I. declined to answer questions about the bureau's use of jeans bar codes or about Dr. Vorder Bruegge's research. Independent researchers say that with many other kinds of pattern analysis, as with jeans bar codes, prosecution witnesses rely too much on subjective judgments rather than rigorous statistics. ""Forensic scientists will say, 'Yeah, I'm sure, based on my 20 years of experience, that these prints were made by that same finger,'"" said Anil Jain, a computer scientist who studies pattern recognition and biometrics. ""They say that's a subjective decision. We want to get away from that."" F.B.I. investigators sometimes present the methods in court as being near-infallible, often citing levels of accuracy that researchers find implausible. In a 2003 case, Dr. Vorder Bruegge claimed that the plaid shirt worn by a bank robber and captured by a security camera made a definitive match with one seized from the home of a suspect. He testified that only one in 650 billion shirts would match so well -- a claim that ""makes about as much sense as the statement two plus two equals five,"" Karen Kafadar, a statistician at the University of Virginia, told ProPublica.","A forensic technique that involves matching patterns on bluejeans is highly inaccurate, a new study suggests.",e9cfb0e4-f21f-5c07-8079-5f2e888cfad6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/14/science/31SCI-JEANS1/31SCI-JEANS1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=370218f1f6797ed05db626e2c657cb6547ddba199af9c851de642382d37f60e4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A new study casts doubt on the reliability of using blue jeans to match criminal suspects with crime scenes.,e9cfb0e4-f21f-5c07-8079-5f2e888cfad6,N24News/imgs/e9cfb0e4-f21f-5c07-8079-5f2e888cfad6.jpg,2
Technology,Uber Fires Executive Over Handling of Rape Investigation in India,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/07/technology/uber-fires-executive.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Uber has fired a senior executive who obtained the medical records of a woman who was raped by an Uber driver in India, the latest example of misconduct unearthed at the ride-hailing giant. Eric Alexander, Uber's president of business in Asia, was terminated on Tuesday after reporters began asking questions about his actions, according to three people familiar with the matter who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about it. The episode provides more ammunition to critics of Uber who say the company's top officials have set a tone that fosters dysfunction. Uber has spent the past three months confronting a series of explosive claims about misconduct in its offices around the world, including accusations of sexual harassment and discrimination. Next week, employees are expected to hear the results of an investigation into the company's culture led by Eric H. Holder Jr., the former attorney general who is now a partner at the law firm Covington and Burling.

Uber said at a staff meeting on Tuesday that it had fired 20 employees in recent months over issues raised in another investigation, while dozens of other employees remain on notice or in training programs meant to address problems that emerged in that inquiry. Mr. Alexander was not among those employees. As investigators pursued tips from rank-and-file Uber workers about problems at the company, top executives did not disclose that they knew Mr. Alexander had obtained the records of the Indian woman, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. Both Travis Kalanick, Uber's chief executive, and Emil Michael, the company's senior vice president of business, had read and discussed the woman's medical records with Mr. Alexander at length, according to those people. Mr. Alexander, who was based in Hong Kong, is a longtime confidant of Mr. Michael's; the two worked together as far back as 15 years ago at the start-up Tellme Networks. Mr. Alexander was also one of Mr. Kalanick's most trusted lieutenants. The three men once attended a South Korean escort bar together, according to two of the people familiar with the medical-records matter. That trip prompted a complaint to Uber's human resources department.

Critics condemned Uber over its screening practices when it emerged that the driver had previously been detained for months on suspicion of rape in a different case. Uber responded to the episode by introducing increased safety measures in its vehicles, including a kind of panic button for passengers who felt unsafe. Uber eventually settled a lawsuit the woman filed against the company; the driver was convicted of rape. The attack came at a fraught time for Uber. The company was banned in Delhi after the story broke, putting at risk Uber's plan to dominate the market in India, a country of more than 1.3 billion people that the company hoped would fuel enormous growth. Uber had also just closed a $1.4 billion round of financing, and was in the middle of talking to other companies about more financing. Mr. Alexander was convinced that the rape charges were part of a plan hatched by Ola, the leading ride-hailing company in India and one of Uber's largest Asian competitors, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. He spent months in India as Uber established itself there, and conducted his own investigation. He shared his concerns with Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Michael, who were also fixated on the case, according to the two people. Mr. Kalanick and Mr. Alexander had long telephone conversations about what they believed to be subterfuge on the woman's part, trying to figure out how to rectify the situation, according to two people familiar with those talks. Mr. Alexander carried the woman's records, which he believed were at odds with her account, with him. The ban imposed on the company in Delhi added to their suspicions. Uber declined to comment on the firing of Mr. Alexander, and he did not respond to a request for comment. Recode first reported news of his termination. Current and former Uber employees were surprised to learn that Mr. Alexander was not one of the 20 employees that Uber said on Tuesday it had fired. He was let go only after reporters asked Uber about his actions, despite several high-level executives having knowledge of the matter, according to two of the people familiar with the matter. For now, Uber employees are awaiting the results of Mr. Holder's investigation. The company is expected to address his findings at a meeting for all employees on Tuesday.",The president of Uber's Asia business was terminated after reporters questioned why he obtained medical records of a woman attacked by her Uber driver.,7cd71315-2b03-5b46-aeb7-5900d556ba8b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/08/business/08UBER1-sub/08UBER1-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=4b06c54aea43704e4a958763248edc1efd3ff1890bb4fb2e57b5513b506a03e3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Eric Alexander, Uber's president of business in Asia, in New Delhi in 2014.",7cd71315-2b03-5b46-aeb7-5900d556ba8b,N24News/imgs/7cd71315-2b03-5b46-aeb7-5900d556ba8b.jpg,20
Books,A Cosmic Being Dies in Yoga Class. Then Things Get Really Weird.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/19/books/review/kathryn-davis-silk-road.html,"If writers can be said to have an animating concern that threads through their work -- memory for Proust, love for Austen -- then 's is none other than the animating force itself, the soul. Davis has been quietly publishing a novel every few years since 1988. She has gathered a small devoted following, and yet she is refreshingly unconcerned with wider success.

Her writing exists outside of genre and trends and time. She operates in a mode that could be called surreal realism, where the boundaries between reality and fantasy dissolve into a place where imagination is akin to gravity and exerts a pull just as powerful. Her eighth novel is even more metaphysical and experimental than its predecessors. If a Hilma af Klint painting could become a book, it would be this one.

""The Silk Road"" opens with a mystery. Eight cosmic beings, whose memories of a shared childhood lead us to believe they are siblings (though they are perhaps variations on a single soul, reincarnations of one another), are taking a yoga class in a subterranean labyrinth somewhere in the arctic north. They are referred to only by their professions: the Astronomer, the Archivist, the Botanist, the Keeper, the Topologist, the Geographer, the Iceman and the Cook. The class is led by the enigmatic Jee Moon, who is described as ""shrouded in something aqueous."" Someone, though we never learn who, fails to arise from corpse pose. It is deemed a murder, but no one is especially interested in solving it.

The book's other mysteries seem more pressing to a reader -- what state of existence are these beings in, who is Jee Moon, where are we, what is the plague that has decimated the population -- and yet the novel is just as uninterested in answering them.","Kathryn Davis's novel ""The Silk Road"" is full of provocative mysteries: Are its characters many or one?

Movies,'Joker' Stairs Become a Bronx Tourist Draw. Hope You're in Shape.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/movies/joker-stairs-bronx.html,"The Bronx staircase made famous by ""Joker"" has drawn a legion of fans since the movie's release. Rami Mahal of San Jose, Calif., put on her best Joker face on Wednesday.





The director Todd Phillips was looking last year for a particular grimy outdoor staircase in New York City. He was interested in one that had appeared in the film ""American Gangster,"" a long set of steps that would convey the hopeless, 1980s urban feel he wanted for his new movie, ""Joker."" The movie's protagonist, Arthur Fleck, would trudge up them on his way home from work. So a location scout, Aaron Hurvitz, 41, did his research and tracked down the ""American Gangster"" stairs in a South Bronx neighborhood. But when he got there, he found the steps weren't quite right. New York wasn't Gotham City anymore. ""As with many stairs in the city, they're getting a makeover,"" Hurvitz said. ""They're getting repaved, they're getting beautified. It wasn't going to work for the aesthetic.""

That is how a humble staircase rising up from Shakespeare and Jerome Avenues became the city's newest tourist destination. Almost every day since the movie's release in early October, dozens, sometimes hundreds , of visitors have traveled to the staircase Hurvitz found to visit and take selfies on the same steps Joaquin Phoenix's character hikes up, and later descends in one of the movie's memorable scenes as he celebrates his transformation into the Joker. By Wednesday, Instagram had more than 2,000 posts associated with ""#JokerStairs,"" many of those photos of people prancing on the steps in Joker attire and makeup, mimicking Phoenix's extravagant dance moves. There are so many posts that it's getting hard to tell them apart, but fans are trying to make their shots stand out: In one Instagram video, two Jokers played table tennis on a landing.

Even on a weekday afternoon, with a constant drizzle making the 132 steps slick and a bit precarious, a steady stream of visitors took turns this week posing and playing photographer. A young woman wearing a Joker-esque red jacket and black shorts improvised some jazzy dance moves for a video camera. She paused to empty some water from a bottle onto her head for effect, then she kicked and twirled and gyrated as the cameraman followed her. A group of tourists from Moscow sang romantic Russian songs with guitar accompaniment partway up the stairs. (""Our friend told us this was an atmospheric place,"" one musician said.) In less than a month since the film's release, the Bronx site has joined a list of iconic stairs from movies and television. Its company includes the ""Exorcist"" stairs in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington; the Rocky Steps at the Philadelphia Museum of Art; and the ""Law & Order"" stairs at the State Supreme Court in Manhattan, which the show's attorneys often climb.

""Excuse me!"" said a woman wearing a backpack as she pushed through a gaggle of tourists crowding the bottom of the stairs. Habib Thiam, 48, a chef who lives on the fifth floor of an apartment building overlooking the staircase, said he remembers peering out of his bathroom window to see a film crew, and Phoenix as the Joker. Now, while he brushes his teeth, he can watch Joker wannabes and Instagram influencers in the same spot.

Frankie Rivera, who has lived there for about 30 years, watched the loose crowd of picture-takers and performers from across the street, where a deli, tax preparation service, and beauty salon were relatively isolated from the frenzy. When Rivera ran marathons, he said, he trained by running up the seven-and-a-half-foot-wide steps, which come in groups of 12 before leveling out into a landing. ""Those were my stairs -- that was my exercise,"" he said. ""I used to go up and down, up and down, 25 times."" The step street is one of dozens in the city, primarily in the jagged terrain of Upper Manhattan and the Bronx, that were created for pedestrian use because they were deemed too steep for cars. In theory, anyway: Rivera, who does maintenance work and lives just across the street, said about a year and a half ago, someone drove a car from top to bottom.

There have been upsides to all the attention. A few months ago, Rivera said, the stairs had been littered with garbage. So much so that he felt that some walked around the block to avoid it. ""Containers of milk, all kinds of garbage -- house garbage,"" he said. Now, Rivera said, he's noticed they've been much cleaner. In fact, about a block south, on Jerome Avenue, there's another staircase largely identical to the now-famous one. It was littered with items including an orange juice carton, a Goldfish bag, a dog food can and a blue Anthora coffee cup. And despite some sentiments, expressed in the Instagram comments sections, that the neighborhood was being invaded by interlopers, most residents did not seem too perturbed. Walking by the scene, some chuckled, then pulled out their phones to take pictures of the tourists taking pictures.

Jhonathan Valencia and Dangelyn Vargas, two 25-year-old actors who both live nearby, stopped at the base of the steps to take in the scene of chattering tourists. They liked that travelers were flocking to the neighborhood where they grew up. ""You know how people say the Bronx is a bad area?"" Valencia said. ""Now people from all over the world are coming here to look at the stairs, the famous stairs!"" Vargas said it was strange to see tourists as far north as West 167th Street , which connects to the top of the staircase: ""Before, they would never go past 161, which is Yankee Stadium. At 167 and Shakespeare? That's unheard-of."" Still, most said the stairs' newfound fame wasn't something they were going to let get into their heads. It was still, under all that Hollywood and Instagram hype, just a long set of stairs. ""Murder on your legs,"" said Tyrell Black, a neighborhood resident who walked his children down the stairs on Tuesday afternoon, warning them to be careful not to slip. The Bronx staircases are so formidable that when Hurvitz, the location scout, found the one that would ultimately show up in ""Joker,"" he only walked halfway down. He had been touring staircases all afternoon, and a person can only take so many steps in a day.",Visitors have been flocking to a long set of Instagram-ready outdoor steps in the Highbridge neighborhood where a memorable scene of the movie was shot.,88aa9646-a86e-55d7-a3a6-d28246504cbe,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/02/arts/02jokerstairs1-print/31jokerstairs2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=95e0ab071827abdb30a63ff17444aa362f4b913fdbdd48b516ea5ea041e45091&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Bronx staircase made famous by &ldquo;Joker&rdquo; has drawn a legion of fans since the movie&rsquo;s release.

Music,"Nashville Embraces Kane Brown and Jimmie Allen, Black Singers Upholding Genre Traditions",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/arts/music/kane-brown-jimmie-allen-experiment-mercury-lane-review.html,"The first striking thing on ""Baby Come Back to Me,"" the opening song on ""Experiment,"" Kane Brown's second album, is Brown's honeyed, low voice. His vowels are slightly drawled, and his tone is rich with a heavy bottom, buoy-shaped, like a more flexible Randy Travis. Behind him, a boot-stomp beat and a throbbing guitar anchor the song firmly to the honky-tonk. Jimmie Allen opens his debut album, ""Mercury Lane,"" with ""American Heartbreaker,"" a familiar kind of country ode. ""If you were a song you'd be an anthem/'Sweet Home Alabama,'"" Allen sweetly sings, then flirts by playing rural mad-libs: freedom, slide guitar, muscle car. The object of his affection, he sings, is ""red, white and beautiful."" This is compliant country music: flaunting its lineage, eager to please, resistant to upheaval. So much of the anxiety in Nashville in recent years has been about the tension between belonging and exclusion, in terms of who the genre advances and promotes (white men, mainly) and what sounds can and should be at its forefront (production that rejects the flickers of hip-hop and EDM that have lately been creeping in). In this context, especially, ""Experiment"" and ""Mercury Lane"" should come as sort of a relief to the establishment: Here are two of the year's stronger country albums, and also two of the more stylistically conservative. They are successful as well: ""Experiment"" debuted at the top of the Billboard album chart this week, and Allen's lead single, ""Best Shot,"" just reached No. 1 on the Billboard country airplay chart, a triumphant conclusion to an almost yearlong climb.

By those metrics, it is a robust time in Nashville for performers who are loyal to the genre's roots and tropes, fluent in its history and proudly advancing it without too much disruption. What complicates and deepens that narrative is that both Brown and Allen are black, and their success flies in the face of a genre that has often been ruthlessly closed-minded about who can lay claim to the rural experience, at least when it comes to songs about it.

Brown has been on the rise for the last three years -- his 2016 self-titled debut album marked him as one of the more musically serious young singers working, and he had two breakthrough hits last year, ""Heaven"" and ""What Ifs."" But at the annual Country Music Association Awards last week, even as ""Experiment"" was heading to No. 1, Brown was not offered a performance slot, merely a presenter slot. That slight was made all the more obvious by the fact that Brown also was a presenter the following night at the Latin Grammys, an awards show for music he doesn't perform in a language that he only slightly speaks -- a signifier of his broad appeal. (Allen was also a presenter at the CMAs, but that felt more appropriate given how recent his success has come.) For the last decade, country music has had one very high-profile black star: Darius Rucker, who's become a genre staple, a Grand Ole Opry member and regular chart presence. He had a bit of a head start thanks to his prior life in the 1990s mega-platinum band Hootie & the Blowfish, but nonetheless Rucker has carved out a distinct place in Nashville.

There is a long and not-always-illuminated history of black performers in country, dating back to DeFord Bailey in the 1920s and 1930s. From the late 1960s through the early 1980s, Charley Pride was one of the genre's marquee names, notable for his gentle love songs. In the mid 2000s, the country rapper Cowboy Troy experienced a brief moment of embrace. The secret histories of less-heralded performers are collected in two excellent collections, the boxed set ""From Where I Stand: The Black Experience in Country Music"" and the anthology ""Dirty Laundry: The Soul of Black Country."" The essay collection ""Hidden in the Mix: The African American Presence in Country Music"" details the ways in which black contributions were key to early country, but largely behind the scenes, and also how the genre conceptualized itself as white, and then set out to maintain that image. All of which leaves it ill-equipped to navigate a time in which black performers are among its most successful and promising. Coming out of country's tepid gentleman era, full of edgeless men with thin voices singing about romantic fealty, Brown was a refreshing alternative: His voice is lustrous, if not especially powerful, and his reference points are often historically minded. One of the standout songs on ""Experiment"" is ""Short Skirt Weather,"" a cheeky two-step that's reminiscent of early Alan Jackson and Tim McGraw. Mainly, though, ""Experiment"" is filled with straight-ahead songs about love and, sometimes, betrayal. He deploys his booming voice as a weapon, especially on the outstanding ""Homesick,"" where he pivots quickly from burly to lovelorn and back. Despite its title, this album isn't about challenging the status quo; rather, its existence is a challenge to those whose ideas about the status quo are fixed in old modes. Brown's own skepticism, such as it is, comes through in small but meaningful ways. ""American Bad Dream"" speaks out about pervasive gun violence -- traditionally a country taboo -- and about devious cops (though only in so much as they make the jobs of good cops harder). And near the end of ""My Where I Come From"" -- the sort of rural pride anthem that is de rigueur for the genre -- Brown issues a little bit of a challenge: So if I like my music just a little too loud

And I got a couple tattoos to show my Georgia pride

And if what's on my mind is what's coming out my mouth

And If I just can't seem to shut it down

That's just my ""where I come from"" comin' out Brown also flirts with arrangements that at least suggest an awareness of hip-hop, and occasionally opts for a more rhythmic cadence, like on the single ""Lose It,"" where he melts several words into one: ""Let'sstartwiththemLuccheses, Babykick'emtothefloorboard/Thembobbypinsholdin'yourhairup, Girlyoudon'tneed'emnomore.""

All of which is to say: a conventional country album. If Allen is fighting for anything here, it's for the right to be that conventional. His arrangements are largely optimistic, rock-inflected country. He is most effective as a romanticist: As a group, the love songs are stronger than the rural-pride anthems, especially ""Best Shot,"" with its choked-up weeping-guitar pattern, and the crisply written and tenderly sung ""How to Be Single."" Allen and Brown's conservative streak can be read two ways: as an unencumbered reflection of their musical impulses, or as the path of least resistance to acceptance in a genre that has long been intolerant. Or perhaps both. In any case, they have effectively made the case that country music need not be -- and actually isn't -- as white as it long has been. How these two singers view their long-term prospects in the genre might be captured by the final songs on their albums. On Brown's ""Experiment"" -- on streaming services, though not on the physical CD -- it's ""Lost in the Middle of Nowhere,"" an amiable duet with the Mexican-American pop singer Becky G that casually bridges country and Latin pop. As grounded as Brown is in country traditions, he understands instinctually that there is an appetite for him, and that his gifts might be more readily accepted elsewhere. Allen takes an opposite approach on his closing song, ""All Tractors Ain't Green."" It's an affectionate scold to the picayune. ""Can't judge whiskey by the bottle/might go against the grain of that country-boy model,"" he sings, later adding, ""I might sound a little different than I look."" Bridging that gap is Allen's ostensible goal, but really, it's other people's obstacle. The message of the song is clear: This is his home turf, and he's not going anywhere.","Brown's ""Experiment"" and Allen's ""Mercury Lane"" are two of the year's stronger, and more stylistically conservative, country albums.",e3e043ea-61ca-512b-aea4-7c268ccedd64,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/22/arts/22country-albums1/22country-albums1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=2aa64fea20abf61b2aab514d45a7eb87385e345ad09858d1ffa18ad1025dec2a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kane Brown's ""Experiment"" debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart.

Books,Susan Orlean Burned a Book. It Was 'Excruciating.',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/26/books/review/susan-orlean-the-library-book-pete-souza-shade.html,"PLAYING WITH FIRE Early in ""The Library Book"" -- about the suspicious fire that roared through the Los Angeles Central Library in 1986 --  decided she needed to see what it felt like to burn a book.

""It took me weeks to decide which book to burn. I didn't want to burn one I didn't like, because that seemed too punishing, and I simply couldn't burn one I loved,"" she says. ""I considered burning one of my own books, but that felt all wrong. In the end, I think I chose the perfect one."" (She picked ""Fahrenheit 451."") Orlean says the actual act was ""excruciating,"" adding, ""I was fascinated by how hard it was, but that convinced me that books are far more than what they appear. They're tangible extensions of our minds and soul. That makes them hard to destroy, even when we know we can replace them easily. That's also why burning books is so often used to terrorize people. Milton believed books contain a spark of human vitality, and that's why we hold them so precious.""

If burning a book was hard, so was describing the actual library blaze. Early chapters, which function as an extended set piece, place the reader inside the conflagration: ""The fire flashed through Fiction, consuming as it traveled. It reached for the cookbooks. The cookbooks roasted. ... Every book in its path bloomed with flame.""

""It was exhilarating and awful"" to recount those scenes, Orlean says. ""Fire is so powerful that it seems to be alive; it has a will to consume and thrive that seems almost animate. The fury and destructiveness of the library fire -- and how it preyed on the utter vulnerability of books -- rattled me. While writing those sections, I began to feel like fire was lurking everywhere, just waiting to reach out and grab me.""","While researching ""The Library Book,"" about the 1986 fire that decimated the Los Angeles Central Library, the author took a paperback and some matches into the yard.",81a368fe-bd09-50d1-989e-768b1888b9bb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/books/review/04-BKS-LIST/04-BKS-LIST-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f0f47276455231b9e2c7980d2c25d1dcd687db857c8bf0368c80e96c9dedbbd9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Susan Orlean,81a368fe-bd09-50d1-989e-768b1888b9bb,N24News/imgs/81a368fe-bd09-50d1-989e-768b1888b9bb.jpg,13
Art & Design,"Up From the Family Basement, a Little-Seen Hamilton Trove",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/arts/design/alexander-hamilton-documents-sothebys.html,"Joanne Freeman of Yale and Selby Kiffer of Sotheby's at the auction house with Hamilton documents.

Starting on Wednesday, Hamil-fans will be able to enjoy a double dose of America's newly favorite founding father: a public exhibition of a trove of documents held privately for more than two centuries by descendants of Alexander Hamilton, in a display at Sotheby's designed by David Korins, the set designer for the musical ""Hamilton."" But one morning last month, many of the documents, which will be auctioned on Jan. 18, were spread on a table in a conference room at Sotheby's Manhattan headquarters. Joanne Freeman, a historian at Yale and a leading expert on Hamilton, had come to look through them. Ms. Freeman is a seasoned archive hound, but this was no ordinary day at the office. When Selby Kiffer, an international senior specialist at the auction house, pulled out a simple sheet inside a protective plastic sleeve, she fell into a hush.

""Without this,"" he said, ""we very likely wouldn't be sitting here talking about Alexander Hamilton."" The wild success of the musical has turned the historical A.Ham himself into a cultural celebrity, and sent museums and other institutions into their back rooms, looking for Hamiltonia to show off. The hundreds of documents at Sotheby's, which were consigned by a sixth-generation descendant of Alexander and Elizabeth Hamilton, had been stored in a trunk in the family basement, though some items, like that 1777 commission, had been put on a pedestal of sorts over the years. ""I probably shouldn't say this, but the commission was on my grandfather's bathroom wall for years,"" David Key, a son of the consignor, said in a telephone interview. ""He loved seeing it over the lavatory."" Mr. Key, an agricultural economist who lives in New York City, said that his mother had always taught her children to take pride in their illustrious forebear, but not too much.

""She would always say, 'You know, we come from a real bastard,'"" he said. ""But it wasn't enthroned in our family as some godlike thing."" The commission, which carries an estimate of $150,000 to $250,000, is only one of the emotionally charged high-ticket items in the sale, whose 77 lots are expected to fetch a total of $1.4 million to $2.1 million. There are several passionate early love letters from Hamilton to his wife, Elizabeth, as well as the only known surviving letter to Hamilton from his son Philip, complete with a hole, torn by sealing wax, that eerily evokes the younger man's death in a duel in 1801. And then there's a lock of graying hair snipped from Hamilton's head after his own fatal duel in 1804, which is being sold with a letter of presentation from Elizabeth. When Mr. Kiffer brought it out, Ms. Freeman recoiled slightly, recalling the various ""founder hairballs"" she had been shown over the years, including a particularly mangy sample from the head of the New York grandee George Clinton.

""I shrieked,"" she said. ""It was not taken well."" Hair may be more dramatic, but it's paper -- especially paper that hasn't been fully mined by earlier scholars -- that really gets a historian's heart pumping. Ms. Freeman, who edited the Library of America edition of Hamilton's writings, said she had emailed the auction house ""within nanoseconds"" of hearing about the sale. ""I've read through all 27 volumes of his papers many times,"" she said. ""So just the idea of seeing something I'd never seen before, and all the new puzzle pieces I'd find, was beyond exciting."" The collection, in addition to numerous unpublished family letters, includes previously unrecorded documents by Hamilton, like the manuscript for one of his so-called Pacificus essays. Those were published pseudonymously in Federalist newspapers in 1793 and 1794 as part of a debate with James Madison over whether to remain neutral in the brewing war between revolutionary France and other European powers. There are also Hamilton's notes for Washington's third annual address to Congress, from 1791, dashed off on an envelope-size scrap. ""It's so of the moment,"" Ms. Freeman said, ""like he jotted it down and said, 'Here you go, Mr. President!'""

It's unclear whether the passage was obliterated by Hamilton or by someone else -- like his son John Church Hamilton, who prepared a 19th-century edition of Hamilton's papers that ""suppressed some correspondence,"" Mr. Kiffer said. There is also a group of letters relating to the first of the 10 ""affairs of honor,"" or ritualistic negotiations over insults to one's reputation that did not result in an actual duel, that Hamilton is known to have been involved in. And there are seemingly banal documents that take on a foreboding quality in retrospect, like an anonymous memorandum, sent to one of Hamilton's brothers-in-law in June 1804, describing a recent town meeting in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Fierce arguments had broken out over whether, should a toast be called for President Thomas Jefferson at the town's Fourth of July celebrations, ""the vice president should also be toasted as such"" -- out of respect for the office, if not for the man himself. In the margin, someone has helpfully penciled in that vice president's name: Aaron Burr. Hamilton's fatal duel with Burr a few weeks later may seem utterly senseless to us now. But it was fought, Ms. Freeman said, out of Hamilton's belief that he needed to preserve his honor so he could lead the country through what he foresaw as an impending crisis of American democracy. Today's partisans do not generally come to physical blows. But Ms. Freeman, whose recently completed book about violence in Congress in the decades before the Civil War will be published next year, said that Hamilton's papers offered a timely reminder that the hard-won norms of American democracy should not be taken for granted. ""People tend to assume the system percolates happily along,"" she said. ""But it sure wasn't percolating happily along here. This was a period where it could have collapsed at any second.""","Before Sotheby's sells a long-held family trove of Alexander Hamilton's documents, the public is invited to take a look.",930dafd6-2a8e-58c5-8250-0dafb388d494,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/10/arts/10HAMILTONJP3/10HAMILTONJP3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cf7231fc0564984f91860b4dad4238a314a04f51211386605d7f61f340254950&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A lock of Hamilton's hair, cut the day he died in 1804.",930dafd6-2a8e-58c5-8250-0dafb388d494,N24News/imgs/930dafd6-2a8e-58c5-8250-0dafb388d494.jpg,14
Media,"Flocking to Buy Charlie Hebdo, Citizens Signal Their Support of Free Speech",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/15/business/media/flocking-to-buy-charlie-hebdo-citizens-signal-their-support-of-free-speech.html,"For people who are supporters of not just free speech but newspapers, too, the images of Parisians queued up at dawn Wednesday to get their hands on a printed artifact was heartening. The French distributors of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo said the latest issue's initial printing of three million copies had been increased to perhaps five million, and there were reports that the now-precious editions were being auctioned on eBay for hundreds of dollars. The image on the cover was of a weeping Prophet Muhammad, framed by two thoughts: ""I am Charlie"" and ""All is forgiven."" But the sentiment that drove the sales probably had less to do with those messages and more to do with the impulse to preserve a world in which the speech of the many cannot be held hostage by a few. The overwhelming response to the special issue of the newspaper, which normally has a print run of 60,000, is a sign that the citizens buying it wanted more than just a totem memorializing the fallen journalists; they were making an affirmative, political act, a vote in support of free speech. Just last month, consumers had responded in large numbers to the opportunity to stream ""The Interview,"" the Sony film that had been withdrawn from theaters after the studio was hacked by forces supported by the government of North Korea.

The message is clear and powerful: Dictators and rogue states are free to control what is seen by people who labor under their rule, but the rest of us have no interest in living like that, where others control the movies in theaters or the selections on newsstands. We may or may not all be Charlie Hebdo, but we certainly want to be free to read the paper if we wish.

It is a principle we have been fighting for since the time of Rousseau and Voltaire, one that is deeply embedded in civil society. And in a modern, web-enabled world, the effort to limit speech will ultimately be fruitless. The fecklessness of those attempts was underlined during the Edward Snowden leaks, when British security forces in the offices of The Guardian oversaw the destruction of hard drives with power tools. Free expression does not live in a single hard drive, film or newspaper; it is widely distributed and reflexively defended as a fundamental right. But even as it becomes more and more obvious that speech of all kinds will carve its own route to an ocean of readers, the impulse to rein it in endures. Not all the French were reveling in unbridled expression of speech. Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a comedian who has made highly provocative statements since the shooting at Charlie Hebdo's offices, was detained as an ""apologist for terrorism"" for statements he made on his Facebook page that were seemingly in support of one of the attackers.

Even as people flock to buy the new issue of Charlie Hebdo, others will question the wisdom of publishing an image of Muhammad after the horrific attack on its offices last week. But it will always be thus. The bleeding edge of the debate over free expression often involves unpalatable and sometimes patently offensive subject matter. Sometimes it's trivial -- should the makers of a buddy movie be allowed to depict the fiery assassination of North Korea's leader, as happened at the end of ""The Interview""? The answer has to be yes, or the dominoes fall toward much more vital, much more precious speech. Defending free speech means defending knuckleheads and visionaries alike. We may prize the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s address at the Lincoln Memorial, but it was the rights of the Nazis to march and wear uniforms in Skokie, Ill., that became a touchstone in the country's free speech movement. News and commentary of all sorts frequently causes pain to its subjects and the audience, but it is precisely the unruly and the offensive that require protection. No one is safe from the slings and arrows of unfettered speech: an image of Christ immersed in an artist's urine, Sinead O'Connor ripping a photo of the pope in half, Eminem fantasizing in rhyme about killing his lover -- all of it is intended to offend. But each is worthy in its own way of being defended. The copies of what has been called the ""survivors' issue"" of Charlie Hebdo are a physical reminder that freedom has costs and only survives through its exercise. The current issue will become an heirloom -- reminding future generations not only that there used to be such a thing as printed newspapers, but that there was a time when most of the world stood with France in their defense.",The sentiment that drove the sales probably had less to do with those messages and more to do with the impulse to preserve a world in which the speech of the many cannot be held hostage by a few.,ca90cc3e-678d-598f-b47b-4c106dd5df57,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/15/business/carr1/carr1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=3a4d697efb75a02d4a6e795d2af96f6d927ed00c5401b08466462b5b8be98c12&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The new issue of the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo being prepared for delivery.

Your Money,How About a Fort Knox of Your Own?,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/11/14/your-money/some-gold-investors-want-their-own-fort-knox.html,"THE last time the world as we knew it seemed likely to end, Dan Tapiero thought about buying gold. He didn't tell his wife; they didn't talk about things like that. In fact he didn't tell anyone for a while. He just tried to figure out how he was going to buy physical gold as the financial markets collapsed at the end of 2008. Mining stocks were not for him, and neither was buying gold on the futures exchange. That was financial gold, meaning it existed on account statements but was not tangible. He wanted the real thing, gold in the form of bullion that he could hold in his palms, smudge with his thumbs. But Mr. Tapiero, a portfolio manager at several hedge funds over the last two decades, realized quite quickly that it was harder to fulfill his desire than he had thought. When he called up one bank he patronized in his day job, he learned it had a minimum purchase amount of $20 million worth of physical gold. Even at that amount, he could not have access to it; it would have to stay at the bank. He didn't want to buy that much, but he wanted to buy more than a bag of gold coins, or a bar or two. Most of all, he wanted to know that it would be stored someplace safe where he could get to it even if all of the banks suddenly closed for a while. ""There was concern at that time that the system was frozen and you didn't really know whether you were going to be able to have access to your money or to your assets,"" Mr. Tapiero said. ""And I started thinking, O.K., well, I'd like to own something that isn't a number on a flashing screen.""

Investing in physical gold has had an image problem of late. After the financial crisis, it was seen by many mainstream advisers as something that crackpots coveted. They would buy it, store in their basements and know that their wealth was secure if the world -- or at least the prevailing financial and political systems -- ended. This was easy to mock, and many people did. What, after all, would you buy with your gold if the world came to an end? Then there was the group that saw gold as a speculative bet, as something that would rise in value as fear about the global economy sunk in. That was less of a crackpot idea: the price of gold went from around $700 an ounce when Mr. Tapiero began buying it in the fall of 2008 to more than $1,900 an ounce last summer. It is now trading around $1,700 an ounce. Mr. Tapiero did not buy his bullion because he thought the world was ending. ""And if it did end,"" he said, ""I don't know that gold would be that important -- it might be radioactive."" He also made clear that he does not keep it at his home in Greenwich, Conn. ""It might not be safe,"" he said, ""if someone holds you at gunpoint and they say, 'Show me your safe' and you open it up and all your gold is there.""

Instead, his gold -- now about 25 percent of his net worth, he said, declining to quantify it further -- is kept in various professionally managed vaults. We met at one in Midtown Manhattan. The vault was in an unassuming, brick office building with a completely plain, even dingy lobby. The offices of the vaulting company, which asked not to be named as a condition for granting me entry, had rows of nondescript cubicles that gave no sign beyond the company logo of what might be going on there. As for the vault itself, it looked secure from the outside. But once past the thick door, it felt completely utilitarian, even a bit grim, particularly for what it held for its undisclosed number of clients. Mr. Tapiero eyed the rows of 100-ounce bars -- each about the size of an iPhone and worth about $170,000 -- and estimated there was $4 billion worth of gold at current prices stacked on metal shelves that looked as if they were built in the 1970s. That amount of gold would fit in the back of an S.U.V. The vault company did not share the identities of other customers. But suspicion that there was interest in owning this kind of physical gold led Mr. Tapiero and a friend, Steven Feldman, to form a company, Gold Bullion International, in 2009. It allows people to buy bullion but also to have access to it and, if they want, have it delivered to their home or anywhere else. Their customers range from chief executives and entrepreneurs to housewives and grandparents buying for their grandchildren. Mr. Tapiero described their challenge as, ""How do we start a company that can provide physical gold -- have it delivered, but also have it stored outside the banking system -- to the retail customer?"" His theory was that gold had been misunderstood in the United States in a way that it had not been in the rest of the world. He attributed this to the inability of individuals to own gold for some 40 years, after President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1933 ordered any American holding more than $100 worth of gold to exchange if for $20.67 an ounce. He did this to prevent individuals from hoarding gold during the Great Depression, and the restriction wasn't lifted until the 1970s.

Another reason Mr. Tapiero thinks people came to misjudge gold was the bull market in stocks from 1982 to 2007, which made owning an asset that just sits there, like gold, unattractive. Mr. Tapiero said that today gold was a legitimate investment that should be part of any diversified portfolio, because it is a hedge against a global economic slowdown and the inflation that many believe will occur when economies pick up. But like many investments, the likelihood that gold will continue to increase in value rests on the rise of India and China. There, gold is being increasingly bought as a way to demonstrate success in addition to as an investment. If you don't need to be able to put your hands on your gold to sleep at night, the World Gold Council sponsors an exchange-traded fund, which trades under the ticker GLD. It allows people to buy and sell shares in a fund that owns gold, much as they would with a mutual fund that owns stocks. Jason Toussaint, managing director of the World Gold Council, said that like Mr. Tapiero, his group wanted people to see gold as something that they should always own and not something they buy only as a safe haven. ""It implies people run to it and then when the storm has passed they go back to risky assets,"" he said. ""We think the time is right to look for a new paradigm."" More traditional advisers see a place for gold in some portfolios, though they put it in the same group as other alternative assets. They also advise keeping the allocation relatively low, 3 to 5 percent of a total portfolio.","It's possible to own gold through an exchange-traded fund, but some investors want the real thing: shiny bars stashed in a vault.",5aa74661-81ab-576e-afbb-d1ba9e58122b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/11/14/your-money/GOLD/GOLD-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=360&w=600&s=167528dce01dc2cb74c32bafdc1bae0da6fd23a006030b2a6b012c829feada05&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Dan Tapiero keeps a portion of his portfolio in a Manhattan vault.,5aa74661-81ab-576e-afbb-d1ba9e58122b,N24News/imgs/5aa74661-81ab-576e-afbb-d1ba9e58122b.jpg,21
Education,A Million Strong: Helping Them Through,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/education/edlife/the-complicated-world-of-higher-education-for-troops-and-veterans.html,"THE class was humanities, the book under discussion Mary Shelley's ""Frankenstein."" Suddenly an alarm blared and 20 students, some calm and some not, filed out of the makeshift classroom. Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan was under rocket attack, again. The students, most of them uniformed troops, repaired to a cramped bunker where a few continued discussing the book. There, they waited for an hour until the all-clear sounded. Class was over. ""We've been through so many of those that you grow callous to it,"" Chief Warrant Officer Justin Hutchinson recalled via Skype. ""For most of us, it was like a cigarette break."" The incident typifies the untypical world of higher education for active-duty troops and veterans. This year, more than one million service members, veterans and their families will take college courses financed with federal tax dollars. Their experiences will be more complicated than those of their fresh-faced civilian peers. As often as not, they float in and out of college like nomads, juggling deployments, families and jobs. If they are in service, they take classes at night or on weekends, studying between combat patrols and 12-hour duty schedules. If they are veterans, they are probably in their late 20s or early 30s and relearning the rules of civilian life after years of martial discipline. Some have physical injuries or mental health issues that can strain their ability to study. And with 15 years to use their post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits, many will take their time graduating.

Many will be like Mr. Hutchinson, who has been taking classes for 12 years in multiple countries and is just now nearing completion of a bachelor's degree in cybersecurity through the University of Maryland University College, an arm of the University System of Maryland that has been educating troops on bases (and now online) under contract with the Pentagon since 1949. In Washington, questions abound about how all these students are faring. The White House went so far as to issue an executive order last year in response to reports that colleges, particularly for-profits schools, were cashing in on the G.I. Bill by aggressively marketing to veterans and not providing the support they needed to complete their studies. Last month, President Obama signed into law legislation requiring colleges to be more transparent about how they serve veterans. The call to action: provide students with better information before enrolling, and get them through once they do. It doesn't help that figures on graduation and retention for veterans are spotty. Surveys show that a majority of colleges don't break out the data. If they do, they don't release it. And the government has not tracked when, or whether, military and veteran students actually graduate. ""There is very little data as relates to persistence and completion for veterans,"" said Bryan J. Cook, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the American Council on Education. ""The primary source of data for all students is one that looks at a small sample of first-time, full-time students, a group which most veterans do not fall into."" That may soon change. In January, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced a partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse, an independent agency, and the Student Veterans of America, an advocacy group, to collect data on veteran students. Federal agencies are also creating new metrics that reflect military and veteran students' tendencies to attend multiple colleges and to take more than four to six years to graduate.

That data is becoming more crucial as Congress enters a contentious debate this year over reducing the federal deficit, a debate that may include talk of trimming spending on veterans' education. Since the G.I. Bill took effect in 2009, 877,000 people, mainly veterans and their dependents, have received benefits costing the government $23.7 billion. More than $10 billion is expected to be spent this year on veterans, plus about $560 million on tuition assistance for active-duty troops. So it is that Eric K. Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs, has been imploring veterans to ""graduate, graduate, graduate,"" as he recently told a conference of the Student Veterans of America in Florida. ""If I sound like your dad, I am. I'm paying most of your bills."" With the flood of veterans onto campuses and online, colleges of all types -- public and private, for-profit and nonprofit, virtual and brick-and-mortar -- are setting up an array of services. They are hiring specialized counselors, opening centers, and offering vets-only classes. ""We know institutions across the country are increasing support services,"" said Meg Mitcham, director of veterans programs at the American Council on Education. ""We don't know the effectiveness of those programs and services.""

Still, many initiatives have one principle at heart: that veterans have a common bond of language and experience, and sharing it can ease the transition and so improve chances of staying the course. Just as campuses provide a way station for adolescents moving into adulthood, they play a crucial role in reintegrating service members into civilian life. THE WALLS of Veteran House, the veterans residence at San Diego State University, are plastered with military memorabilia: flags from Iraq and Afghanistan beside photos of present and former residents on tour on the streets of Baghdad, Kabul and Mosul. A bulletin board is pinned with badges and braids, and above the front door hang uniforms donated by residents from every wing of the armed forces. It sits on Fraternity Row, somewhat incongruously for a house for older students ""who don't want to hang out and get drunk every night,"" said Gwen Notestine, the university's senior director of development. Six three-bedroom units overlook a courtyard draped with a camouflage net and equipped with the usual dorm paraphernalia: a barbecue, a smoker and picnic tables that have seen their fair share of both revelry and emotion.

""Sometimes you'll see two vets out here, and you'll see that one of the guys is crying,"" said Adam Goodson, 32, who is studying psychology after serving nine years in the Marine Corps. ""We'll just say: 'Keep inside, leave those guys alone. This guy needs someone to talk to.' "" With the departure of the U.S. military on Aug. 30, Afghanistan quickly fell back under control of the Taliban. Across the country, there is widespread anxiety about the future.
* None
* Vanishing Rights: The Taliban's decision to restrict women's freedom may be a political choice as much as it is a matter of ideology.
* Far From Home: Some Afghans who were abroad when the country collapsed are desperate to return, but have no clear route home.
* Can Afghan Art Survive? The Taliban have not banned art outright. But many artists have fled, fearing for their work and their lives.
* A Growing Threat: A local affiliate of the Islamic State group is upending security and putting the Taliban government in a precarious position. In the common area, Thursday night is movie night, a double bill of comedy or horror, accompanied by pizza and maybe a few cans of beer. Upstairs, there's an air hockey table, pool table and arcade machine where veterans can unwind, gradually getting used to life as a civilian. ""It's definitely nice to be around a bunch of guys who've been in the same situation, chewed the same dirt, been around the block,"" said 24-year-old Andrew Lovick, who served for four years in the Marines. ""We're the same demographic. It's kind of hard relating to someone who's 18 and their parents are paying for everything. You've been to Afghanistan and stuff and someone's like, 'Oh, my God, my dad won't pay the phone bill!'"" San Diego State, in a city with one of the heaviest concentrations of veterans in the country, has one of the earliest and most extensive college programs, including special mentoring for engineering majors, veterans-only classes and, the heart of its program, an endowed center in the student services building. While the university's data sample is small, veterans as a group seem to perform a bit better than its general population. A 2011 report by the American Council on Education, ""Promising Practices in Veterans' Education,"" found that services that made veterans feel at home on campus seemed to make a difference. It cited training faculty in military culture and in identifying the symptoms of post-traumatic stress, as well as specialized academic advising and counselors to handle questions about the G.I. Bill and other federal benefits. Also important was having all this under one roof. And so campuses from Minnesota State to the University of Southern Florida to the University of Alabama have veterans centers. When students walk into San Diego's Joan and Art Barron Veterans Center, they are immediately greeted by a veteran who can direct them to the appropriate service. The lounge is known as the Bunker, a place to play video games and to swap stories military and academic. Mr. Lovick explains the importance of a veterans community: ""We try to be our brother's keeper, just look out for each other,"" he said. ""Just saying, 'Hey, have you done your homework?' ""

To Mr. Martin, the presentations were an example of how college can help veterans return to society, not only by making them feel at home but also by bringing them into meaningful contact with nonveterans. ""I've learned that creating community was key for the veterans,"" he said. ""Those relationships will keep them in school."" JOHN L. BARBATO, 60, exemplifies the global reach of the University of Maryland University College. For 22 years, he has taught marketing and finance for the university on five continents, including four times in Afghanistan. Last spring, he taught a management course in Kandahar and gave four-day seminars at combat outposts around the country, including for a special operations team. On several occasions, he recalled, his students received cellphone calls before dashing out the door to waiting helicopters. Despite such distractions, his combat-zone students often seemed more focused than his students in Germany, where he is based. ""One student told me: 'I work 16-hour days, I walk the perimeter and I'm scared,'"" he said. ""'But for three hours I get to come to your class and we talk about Walmart or McDonald's, and it just takes my mind off of what I'm going through.""

Though University College has classes on bases around the world and at its main campus outside Washington, a majority of its 50,000 military students -- active-duty service members, veterans and their families -- take classes online. It's a pivotal time for the university. Some of its contracts to educate troops will be up this year. It has faced fierce competition for students from for-profit schools. And when its president stepped down unexpectedly last year amid increased spending on marketing, it raised questions. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions was interested particularly in whether the university was spending excessively on recruiting veterans and military, the very criticism leveled at for-profit schools. ""When you are serving adults, you have to reach the adult where the adult is,"" the current president, Javier Miyares, said, explaining why 7 percent of the budget goes to marketing. After a series of exchanges, the committee ended its review, apparently satisfied. The university reports a five-year graduation rate of 53 percent for military students who transferred in with at least nine credits, but it has only recently started tracking veterans' progress. If a key to keeping veterans in school is building community, online courses face particular challenges. Without a vet center how do you foster camaraderie? How do you help with post-traumatic stress on a virtual campus? Two counselors are assigned full time to University College's Washington campus, part of a Veterans Affairs initiative that places counselors on 32 campuses around the country. Shonda McLaughlin, who has a doctorate in rehabilitation research and education, was sitting recently in the small office she shares at University College with her fellow counselor, where she fields phone calls and e-mails about, say, applying for disability benefits or, once, finding a place to live for a temporarily homeless student. ""Initially developing that rapport can be difficult,"" she said. ""But I believe whatever I do face to face I can do online."" Among efforts to keep students from quitting, the university offers a special orientation program for veterans. Once a month prospective and new students can get a taste of the virtual classroom to see if it's for them. Over five days, they test-drive a course with a mock syllabus, get tips on turning in assignments and interact with counselors and other veterans. Late last year, the university added the Veterans Club, a social media site on which students can share advice among themselves.

Veterans trust the advice of other veterans more than civilians', Gregory Barber said. After 20 years in the Air Force, he should know. While deployed in the United States, Korea, England and Germany, he took courses online, on bases and at community colleges. Now 47, he is working as a military contractor and studying with University College for a master's in cybersecurity. ""A lot of veterans are afraid to go to school,"" he said. ""They've been in the military so long, they don't know if they can do the schoolwork. It helps them to talk to veterans who have done it. It makes them think: 'He did it. Maybe I can do it.' "" It can be difficult for online schools to form student organizations, something experts say is critical to recreating the camaraderie of the small-unit culture of the military. Last year, the Student Veterans of America revoked charters for 26 for-profit schools, many of them online, after learning their chapters were run by administrators instead of, as required, student veterans. With online students so geographically scattered and time constrained, even the nonprofit University College struggles to get a group going. The key is a leader who will keep it vital, and University College hopes it has found that person in Mr. Barber. He has begun contacting a small group of veterans about meet-ups beginning this spring, in Washington and online. ""Some veterans need a place,"" he said. ""They're waiting for it.""","With more than $10 billion being spent this year educating troops and veterans, the order has been given: help them graduate.

Savoir Beds has provided beds for the Savoy Hotel in London since 1905. The two have teamed up to offer visitors' tours of the bedmaker's workshop followed by afternoon tea in the Savoy's glass-domed lounge, known as the Thames Foyer.  The tour lasts about 90 minutes, during which visitors will meet the artisans and learn about their techniques. Visitors then proceed to the Savoy to enjoy the hotel's traditional tea with scones, clotted cream, sandwiches and dessert. The tour is PS140 (about $215) per person, including car transportation in central London. Book through tours@savoirbeds.co.uk.

Business class passengers flying on KLM Royal Dutch Airlines from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Amsterdam now have new cuisine to look forward to from Beck Bolender, the executive chef of One Twenty One, in North Salem, N.Y., and a former sous chef at Jean-Georges in New York. For the airline, Mr. Bolender has created menus that reflect the seasonally inspired dishes he serves in his restaurant. First introduced in June, these dishes include Korean barbecue chicken, miso glazed cod with ginger-scented carrots and rigatoni with mushroom Bolognese. The meals are prepared daily in KLM's catering kitchens at J.F.K. The airline has two daily flights between Amsterdam and J.F.K.

Sheraton Hotels and Resorts is looking to improve the food served in the lobby bars of its more than 430 hotels around the world. Starting tomorrow, the hotel chain is introducing a program called ""Paired,"" where hotel guests can choose from a menu of locally inspired small plates and enjoy them with an extensive menu of wines by the glass and craft beer from local brewers. Many of the Sheraton properties plan to have regular programs in the lobby bars such as tastings from local breweries and sommelier talks on matching food and wine.","What you need to know if you're on a trip or planning one soon, including where the Savoy in London gets its bed made, a new chef for KLM and new bar food for Sheraton hotels around the world.",9ae9f554-54f1-5b4f-96b6-0e3391f3ea5e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/28/travel/28intransit-tuesday/28intransit-tuesday-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=353&w=675&s=c8a6f6aab697024841883a4723c1857473e291115e928037ea665176dd1a383a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Beds for the Savoy are made by hand using materials like horsetail hair, Mongolian cashmere and British lamb's wool.",9ae9f554-54f1-5b4f-96b6-0e3391f3ea5e,N24News/imgs/9ae9f554-54f1-5b4f-96b6-0e3391f3ea5e.jpg,4

Science,The Stuff That Helps Leeches Get Their Fill of Blood,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/science/leeches-blood-anticoagulants.html,"You might think you know leeches: Go for a swim in the wrong shallow lake, and you'll emerge covered in sleek black bloodsuckers that have decided you're their next meal.

The slimy creatures manufacture a wide portfolio of substances that help keep blood flowing once they've attached themselves to a host. They don't just latch on to you -- they pump out anticoagulants that prevent the wounds they create from clotting too quickly. How else are they going to get their fill?

And once they've sucked your blood -- they can consume many times their own body weight in one sitting, or rather, sucking -- they're not done. Leeches must also keep the blood from solidifying in their own digestive tract long after they've let go of their host.

""We've had leeches that can live off a single blood meal for a year,"" said Michael Tessler, a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History who is a co-author of a recent paper on leeches in the Journal of Parasitology, which focused on the anticoagulant genes in leeches' salivary organs.","Researchers examined the arsenal of anticoagulants used by marine leeches to feed on turtles, fish and even sharks.",077c9f91-66e8-5130-93a8-3d0f302b6b65,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/14/science/14TB-LEECHES/20TB-LEECHES-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=76bd0e3c583abceff2ea4594fcd252b25e1d1be832817c9020ebba058a1e3552&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Once they've fed, leeches can also keep the blood from solidifying in their own digestive tract long after they've detached, living off a single blood meal for a year.",077c9f91-66e8-5130-93a8-3d0f302b6b65,N24News/imgs/077c9f91-66e8-5130-93a8-3d0f302b6b65.jpg,2
Health,Killing a Patient to Save His Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/10/health/a-chilling-medical-trial.html,"PITTSBURGH -- Trauma patients arriving at an emergency room here after sustaining a gunshot or knife wound may find themselves enrolled in a startling medical experiment. Surgeons will drain their blood and replace it with freezing saltwater. Without heartbeat and brain activity, the patients will be clinically dead. And then the surgeons will try to save their lives. Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center have begun a clinical trial that pushes the boundaries of conventional surgery -- and, some say, medical ethics. By inducing hypothermia and slowing metabolism in dying patients, doctors hope to buy valuable time in which to mend the victims' wounds.

But scientists have never tried anything like this in humans, and the unconscious patients will not be able to consent to the procedure. Indeed, the medical center has been providing free bracelets to be worn by skittish citizens here who do not want to participate should they somehow wind up in the E.R. ""This is 'Star Wars' stuff,"" said Dr. Thomas M. Scalea, a trauma specialist at the University of Maryland. ""If you told people we would be doing this a few years ago, they'd tell you to stop smoking whatever you're smoking, because you've clearly lost your mind."" Submerged in a frozen lake or stowed away in the wheel well of a jumbo jet at 38,000 feet, people can survive for hours with little or no oxygen if their bodies are kept cold. In the 1960s, surgeons in Siberia began putting babies in snow banks before heart surgery to improve their chances of survival. Patients are routinely cooled before surgical procedures that involve stopping the heart. But so-called therapeutic hypothermia has never been tried in patients in which a penetrative wound has already occurred, and until now doctors have never tried to replace a patient's blood entirely with cold saltwater. In their trial, funded by the Department of Defense, doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center will be performing the procedure only on patients who arrive at the E.R. with ""catastrophic penetrating trauma"" and who have lost so much blood that they have gone into cardiac arrest.

At normal body temperatures, surgeons typically have less than five minutes to restore blood flow before brain damage occurs. ""In these situations, less than one in 10 survive,"" said Dr. Samuel A. Tisherman, the lead researcher of the study. ""We want to give people better odds."" Dr. Tisherman and his team will insert a tube called a cannula into the patient's aorta, flushing the circulatory system with a cold saline solution until body temperature falls to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. As the patient enters a sort of suspended animation, without vital signs, the surgeons will have perhaps one hour to repair the injuries before brain damage occurs. After the operation, the team will use a heart-lung bypass machine with a heat exchanger to return blood to the patient. The blood will warm the body gradually, which should circumvent injuries that can happen when tissue is suddenly subjected to oxygen after a period of deprivation. If the procedure works, the patient's heart should resume beating when body temperature reaches 85 to 90 degrees. But regaining consciousness may take several hours or several days.

The experiment officially began in April and the surgeons predict they will see about one qualifying patient a month. It may take a couple of years to complete the study. Citing the preliminary nature of the research, Dr. Tisherman declined to say whether he and his colleagues had already operated on a patient. Each time they do, they will be stepping into a scientific void. Ethicists say it's reasonable to presume most people would want to undergo the experimental procedure when the alternative is almost certain death. But no one can be sure of the outcome. ""If this works, what they've done is suspended people when they are dead and then brought them back to life,"" said Dr. Arthur L. Caplan, a medical ethicist at New York University. ""There's a grave risk that they won't bring the person back to cognitive life but in a vegetative state."" But researchers at a number of institutions say they have perfected the technique, known as Emergency Preservation and Resuscitation, or E.P.R., in experimental surgeries on hundreds of dogs and pigs over the last decade. As many as 90 percent of the animals have survived in recent studies, most without discernible cognitive impairment -- after the procedure, the dogs and pigs remembered old tricks and were able to learn new ones. ""From a scientific standpoint, we now know the nuts and bolts and that it works,"" said Dr. Hasan B. Alam, chief of general surgery at the University of Michigan Medical Center, who has helped perfect the technique in pigs.

""It's a little unsettling if you think of all the what ifs, but it's the same every time you push into new frontiers,"" he added. ""You have to look at risk and balance it against benefits."" Trauma accounts for more years of life lost than cancer and heart disease combined, and it is the leading cause of death in people up to age 44, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Surgeons are eager for new techniques that would help better the odds in emergency situations. Black males are disproportionately victims of homicide, especially gun violence, and most of the patients likely to fit the study criteria in Pittsburgh are African-American males, according to officials at the medical center. In order to obtain an exemption to federal informed consent rules, the hospital held two town hall meetings on the university campus, placed advertisements on buses, and made sure the news got in newspapers catering to minority readers. Officials posted information about the study on a website, acutecareresearch.org, and conducted a phone survey in the neighborhoods most at risk for ""involuntary enrollment"" in the trial. Still, a taxi driver, grocery clerk and security guard -- all African-American men approached at random -- said they had never heard of the trial, though they work within a couple of miles of the hospital. They also did not object. ""I don't have a problem with it, if it saves lives,"" said Charles Miller, a 52-year-old security guard. Just 14 people have so far requested ""No E.P.R."" bracelets, according to the medical center. Nearly a half-dozen trauma hospitals may join the trial and begin testing the hypothermia procedure on dying patients, including the University of Maryland Medical Center in Baltimore. Dr. Scalea, who will head the effort there, said he hoped to receive final regulatory approval by the end of the year. He recalled a recent stabbing victim who died on his operating table. ""He might have lived if we could have cooled him down,"" Dr. Scalea said.",Doctors at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center plan to treat trauma patients with an experimental procedure that induces hypothermia in dying patients to buy them more time.,041151c3-cd33-5b2a-9712-e02ececc35e2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/10/science/10SURG/10SURG-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=336&w=600&s=286ae8208dbd5cc18877ce7bfd6a1c71165cf4f5214d7b68a7de9ee70ec9f0b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"In a simulation, doctors in Pittsburgh practice a procedure that involves draining the blood and replacing it with cold salt water.",041151c3-cd33-5b2a-9712-e02ececc35e2,N24News/imgs/041151c3-cd33-5b2a-9712-e02ececc35e2.jpg,1
Technology,Hundreds of Apps Can Empower Stalkers to Track Their Victims,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/19/technology/phone-apps-stalking.html,"KidGuard is a phone app that markets itself as a tool for keeping tabs on children. But it has also promoted its surveillance for other purposes and run blog posts with headlines like ""How to Read Deleted Texts on Your Lover's Phone."" A similar app, mSpy, offered advice to a woman on secretly monitoring her husband. Still another, Spyzie, ran ads on Google alongside results for search terms like ""catch cheating girlfriend iPhone."" As digital tools that gather cellphone data for tracking children, friends or lost phones have multiplied in recent years, so have the options for people who abuse the technology to track others without consent. More than 200 apps and services offer would-be stalkers a variety of capabilities, from basic location tracking to harvesting texts and even secretly recording video, according to a new academic study. More than two dozen services were promoted as surveillance tools for spying on romantic partners, according to the researchers and reporting by The New York Times. Most of the spying services required access to victims' phones or knowledge of their passwords -- both common in domestic relationships.

Digital monitoring of a spouse or partner can constitute illegal stalking, wiretapping or hacking. But laws and law enforcement have struggled to keep up with technological changes, even though stalking is a top warning sign for attempted homicide in domestic violence cases. ""We misunderstand and minimize this abuse,"" said Erica Olsen, director of the Safety Net Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence. ""People think that if there's not an immediate physical proximity to the victim, there might not be as much danger."" Statistics on electronic stalking are hard to find because victims may not know they are being watched, or they may not report it. Even if they believe they are being tracked, hidden software can make confirmation difficult. But data breaches at two surveillance companies last year -- revealing accounts of more than 100,000 users, according to the technology site Motherboard -- gave some sense of the scale. The tracking app company mSpy told The New York Times that it sold subscriptions to more than 27,000 users in the United States in the first quarter of this year. According to data published last year by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 27 percent of women and 11 percent of men in the United States at some point endure stalking or sexual or physical violence by an intimate partner that has significant effects. While comprehensive numbers aren't available on domestic abuse cases involving digital stalking in the United States, a small survey published in Australia in 2016 found that 17 percent of victims were tracked via GPS, including through such apps.

This January, Mr. Toledo was sentenced to three consecutive life terms after being convicted of killing his wife, Yessenia Suarez, and her two children. Sergeant Pagliari said Mr. Toledo told him he installed the app several days before her death. ""With the use of the app, Toledo was able to confirm his suspicion,"" the sergeant said. Representatives for SMS Tracker, made by the Dallas-based Gizmoquip, did not respond to requests for comment about the app's role in the case. A recent review on the Google Play store for SMS Tracker tells potential users: ""I would recommend if you think your partner is cheating."" There is no federal law against location tracking, but such monitoring can violate state laws on stalking. Spying on communications can break statutes on wiretapping or computer crime. And knowingly selling illegal wiretapping tools is a federal crime. But it's not illegal to sell or use an app for tracking your children or your own phone. And it can be difficult to tell whether the person being surveilled has given consent, because abusers frequently coerce victims into using such apps.

In Everson, Wash., for example, Brooks Owen Laughlin is accused of beating his wife and using an app typically used for benign purposes, Find My iPhone, to control her movements. Luis Toledo was convicted of killing his wife, Yessenia Suarez, and her two children, Michael Otto, 8, left, and Thalia Otto, 9, right. Mr. Toledo had installed an app called SMS Tracker on Ms. Suarez's phone because he suspected she was having an affair. ""If she would turn it off, he would instantly call her or text her and say, 'Why did you turn that off? What are you doing?' That was pretty much 24-7,"" Chief Daniel MacPhee of the Everson Police Department, said in an interview. Mr. Laughlin pleaded not guilty in April to charges of assault, harassment and stalking. Such technical and legal ambiguity has created an environment in which tools are marketed for both legal and illegal uses, without apparent repercussion. ""There are definitely app makers that are complicit, seeking out these customers and advertising this use,"" said Periwinkle Doerfler, a doctoral student at New York University and an author of the study on apps, which will be presented in the coming days. ""They're a little bit under the radar about it, but they're still doing it."" The researchers, from N.Y.U., Cornell University and Cornell Tech, contacted customer support for nine companies with tracking services. The researchers claimed to be women who wanted to secretly track their husbands, and only one company, TeenSafe, refused to assist. KidGuard, the app largely aimed at parents, also bought ads alongside Google results for searches like ""catch cheating spouse app."" A spokesman for the business, based in Los Angeles, said in an email that the company worked with third-party marketers and customer service reps who had been ""testing new strategies."" It deleted blog posts about tracking romantic partners and said it did not support that activity. Spyzie, another app that ran such ads, did not respond to requests for comment. On YouTube, dozens of videos provide tutorials on using several of the apps to catch cheating lovers. The videos frequently link back to the app makers' sites using a special code that ensures the promoter will get a cut of the sale -- a type of deal known as affiliate marketing.

Reviews and online discussions about the apps suggest the market for spying on spouses has been important to the businesses. FlexiSPY, an app company, posted survey results on its site showing that 52 percent of potential customers were interested because they thought their partners might be cheating. Asked about the results, the company said the data was five years old and ""no longer relevant."" The proliferation of such tracking apps raises questions about the role of businesses like Google and Apple in policing their services. The two companies, which run nearly all smartphones in the United States, have long taken different approaches to regulating apps. Apple makes it difficult for iPhone users to download apps from outside the company's App Store, and has many restrictions on what apps in its store can do. After testing several programs available in the stores on both platforms, the researchers found that Apple's strict rules resulted in more limited surveillance capabilities on those apps than those running Google's software. Many App Store apps offered location tracking for phones. But for more intrusive surveillance, spying companies had to work around Apple's restrictions by using the victim's name and password to get data. To combat misuse by predators, an Apple spokesman said, the company urges people to use a tool called two-factor authentication to help protect their accounts even if their passwords are stolen.

Google prides itself on being more open. Its smartphone software, Android, allows people to install apps from anywhere, and the most invasive ones were found outside the company's app store, Play. The researchers found two apps in the Google Play store that allowed the app icon to be hidden from victims and the camera to run without notifications, as well as a handful of others that tracked users' locations without telling them, all apparent violations of Google's rules. ""They're not enforcing their own policies,"" Ms. Doerfler, the N.Y.U. researcher, said. ""If someone reports it then they'll take it down, but it's not something they are checking within their operating system."" In response to the researchers' findings, Google tightened several policies ""to further restrict the promotion and distribution"" of surveillance apps, a company spokesman said. The company provides funding to the N.Y.U. team that helped conduct the study.

Victims' advocates said they noticed after the case that makers of surveillance tools changed their tactics, sometimes moving computer servers overseas or scrubbing explicit language about spousal spying from their websites. ""As soon as these companies caught wind that they shouldn't be doing it, they just changed their marketing,"" Ms. Olsen said. One app maker told The Times that he hired a legal team after the StealthGenie case to help him avoid running afoul of the law. ""There were a few modifications we had to make,"" said Patrick Hinchy, the founder of New York-based ILF Mobile Apps, which makes Highster Mobile and other services. Several apps, he said, removed call recording and delayed the availability of the data by 10 to 15 minutes. Mr. Hinchy said the company only provided assistance to customers that it believed was legal. When a researcher recently contacted the company and asked, ""If I use this app to track my husband, will he know that I am tracking him?"" the representative responded: ""Our software is undetectable from the home screen.""","Widely available services offer a range of spying abilities, including tracking people's phones and harvesting their texts.

Health,Four More People Die From Tainted Romaine Lettuce,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/01/health/romaine-ecoli-outbreak-deaths.html,"Four more people have died from tainted romaine lettuce, federal health officials said Friday, bringing the total to five deaths related to a virulent strain of E. coli whose source has still not been located.

In addition, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated the case count: 197 people from 35 states were sickened.

Food and Drug Administration officials said, however, that romaine now for sale on grocery shelves is safe to eat. The growing season in the Yuma, Ariz. region, which produced the contaminated lettuce, ended April 16. According to an FDA blog post, ""Any contaminated product from the Yuma growing region has already worked its way through the food supply and is no longer available for consumption. So any immediate risk is gone.""

The F.D.A. said its investigators were still working to trace sources of the outbreak. While they have traced the toxic E. coli strain to the Yuma growing region, they are still looking for the precise source -- whether it originated in the water supply, harvesting equipment, a processing plant in the area or somewhere else.","To date, 197 people have been sickened in the E. coli outbreak tied to romaine, and five have died, the CDC said.

Health,Breast Implants Linked to Rare Cancer Are Recalled Worldwide,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/health/breast-implants-cancer-recall.html,"Textured breast implants made by Allergan that have been linked to an unusual cancer are being recalled in the United States at the request of the Food and Drug Administration, and will also be recalled globally, the agency announced on Wednesday. The F.D.A. decision, based on an increasing number of cases and deaths from the implant-associated cancer, lags far behind action in Europe, where the Allergan devices were effectively banned late last year. Worldwide, 573 cases and 33 deaths from the cancer have been reported, with 481 of the cases clearly attributed to Allergan Biocell implants, the F.D.A. said. Of the 33 deaths, the agency said its data showed that the type of implant was known in 13 cases, and in 12 of those cases the maker was Allergan. ""The data regarding deaths was particularly informative of our decisions,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Shuren, director of the F.D.A.'s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.

The disease is anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, a rare cancer of the immune system. It is not breast cancer, but develops in tissue around the implant. In most cases, removing the implant and the scar tissue around it cures the cancer, but if it is not detected early it can spread and kill the patient. The condition has occurred with implants placed for cosmetic breast enlargement and with those used for reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer. The F.D.A. first recognized the link to breast implants in 2011. The lymphoma is rare, given that millions of women have breast implants. Breast enlargement is the most popular type of plastic surgery in the United States, with more than 300,000 operations performed in 2017, a 3 percent increase over 2016, according to the most recent data from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. About 100,000 other women received implants in 2017 during reconstructive surgery after mastectomy for breast cancer in the United States. Despite the low incidence of the lymphoma, the F.D.A. said in a safety communication for patients that ""at the present time, we believe all individuals who are considering a breast implant of any type be informed of the risk of developing"" the disease. The Biocell textured implants carry a risk that is about six times that of other textured implants sold in the United States, the agency said. Hundreds of thousands of women in the United States have Biocell implants, Dr. Binita Ashar, director of the F.D.A.'s Office of Surgical and Infection Control Devices, said at a news briefing on Wednesday about the recall. The main symptoms of the lymphoma are usually swelling and fluid accumulation around the implant. If those symptoms occur, the fluid should be drained and tested for the cancer.

Women who have these implants, but no symptoms, do not need to have them removed, the F.D.A. said. The recall means that doctors and hospitals should not implant any more of the devices and should return any on their shelves to Allergan, a major international manufacturer of breast implants. ""Patient safety is a priority for Allergan,"" the company said in a statement, ""and patients are advised to speak with their plastic surgeon about the risk and benefits of their implant type should they have any concerns."" Dr. Mark Clemens, a plastic surgeon at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who has been studying the lymphoma, said he supported the F.D.A.'s decision. ""We have tried to give them all the data and the information that they need to make this decision,"" he said.

The agency held two days of emotionally charged meetings about breast implants in March, hearing from women who had had lymphoma and others who had developed debilitating symptoms like pain and fatigue after receiving implants, which the F.D.A. had acknowledged might occur. The lymphoma patients called for a ban on textured implants. But in May, the agency declined to ban the implants, saying that the lymphoma risk was low and that there was not enough data to justify taking the devices off the market. But a significant increase in the number of cases and deaths led the agency to act on Wednesday. Raylene Hollrah was treated for the implant-associated lymphoma in 2013 and has become an advocate for patients. ""It's a win for us, finally,"" she said. ""We've been advocating for a long time, and it's the right thing to be done. We're just disappointed it took this long.""

Ms. Hollrah, who testified at the F.D.A. meeting in March, added, ""Our work is not done yet."" She said she and other advocates heard from patients every day seeking help with lymphoma, including some who had implants that were not part of the recall. Many of those patients had received incorrect diagnoses or had difficulty getting doctors to take their symptoms seriously. The recalled devices listed by the F.D.A. are Biocell products including: Natrelle saline-filled breast implants, Natrelle silicone-filled breast implants, Natrelle Inspira silicone-filled breast implants and Natrelle 410 highly cohesive anatomically shaped silicone-filled breast implants. The recall also includes tissue expanders used by patients before breast augmentation or reconstruction, including Natrelle 133 Plus tissue expander and Natrelle 133 tissue expander with suture tabs. The stock price of Allergan, which makes an array of products like Botox and treatments for dry eyes, dipped slightly on the news. It was down about 0.3 percent midday Wednesday. F.D.A. officials said they were continuing to monitor the incidence of lymphoma linked to other types of implants and would take action against them if needed. They also said they were considering changes to the labeling of breast implants, like adding a black-box warning to draw attention to the risks, and requiring doctors and patients considering the surgery to go over a checklist to help women understand the benefits and risks of the devices. The contents of the implant, silicone or saline, are not a factor in the lymphoma. The covering or shell of the implant, which can be either smooth or textured, is the key. Textured implants, which have a slightly roughened surface that adheres to tissue and helps hold the device in place, have been singled out as the cause of the lymphoma. Why the texturing leads to cancer in some patients is not known. Some people may be genetically predisposed to have an inflammatory reaction to the texturing that can gradually lead to cancer, Dr. Clemens, the plastic surgeon, said. Some researchers also suspect that bacteria trapped in crevices in the roughened surface might somehow lead to the lymphoma.","Under pressure from the Food and Drug Administration, Allergan will stop selling textured implants. Thirty-three deaths have been tied to the devices.",b20ff963-8d43-5e5e-b751-f40516a0bac0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/24/science/24BREASTIMPLANT/24BREASTIMPLANT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=ff45f57982c4f30c020b868b0840c7bc0e0e47179ba914dc9ff87395698a322f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A textured breast implant.

Health,"In Rehab, 'Two Warring Factions': Abstinence vs. Medication",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/health/opioid-rehab-abstinence-medication.html,"Credit...Ilana Panich-Linsman for The New York Times





MURFREESBORO, Tenn. -- Just past a cemetery along a country road, an addiction treatment center called JourneyPure at the River draws hundreds of patients a month who are addicted to opioids and other drugs. They divide their days between therapy sessions, songwriting, communing with horses and climbing through a treetop ropes course. After dinner, they're driven into town in white vans for 12-step meetings. It is a common regimen at residential treatment programs, but as the opioid epidemic persists, JourneyPure is evolving. Though its glossy website doesn't mention it, the company is ramping up its use of medications to blunt the torturous withdrawal symptoms and cravings that compel many with opioid addiction to keep using. There is substantial evidence backing this approach, which is supposed to be used in tandem with therapy. But because two of the three federally approved medicines are opioids themselves, it is spurned by people who believe taking drugs to quit drugs is not real recovery. Addiction experts say such resistance is obstructing efforts to reduce overdose deaths and help addicted Americans get their lives back on track, even as many drain their savings or go into debt paying for repeated stints in residential rehab. Two-thirds of the patients admitted to JourneyPure's program here over the last three months said it wasn't their first time in treatment. ""I'm watching the dominoes fall on our industry,"" said David Perez, JourneyPure at the River's new chief executive, who has helped lead the push toward using more medication-assisted treatment. ""People are dying, and we are feeling more and more impotent to stop it. That is what's shifting beliefs, more than anything.""

The internal tensions over JourneyPure's changing policy, and how proactively it should promote medication as an option, reflect an often reluctant shift taking place in the drug treatment world. At the same time, the Trump administration's view on medication-assisted treatment has evolved from critical to fully supportive. Tom Price, Mr. Trump's first Health and Human Services secretary, appalled many addiction experts by saying, ""If we're just substituting one opioid for another, we're not moving the dial much."" But Mr. Price's successor, Alex Azar, a former pharmaceutical executive, has embraced the approach. When the administration announced $1 billion in new grants to expand access to treatment earlier this year, it emphasized that only programs that made these medicines available were eligible. Mr. Azar has also enlisted his agency's Center for Faith and Opportunity Initiatives, to reach out and explain the importance of medication to religiously affiliated providers of treatment and recovery services, which tend to embrace an abstinence-only approach. More than 70,000 people in the United States died of overdoses in 2017, and opioids were the main driver. But nationally, 49 percent of the nearly 3,000 residential programs that treat opioid addiction still don't use any of the medications proven to save lives, according to an analysis by amfAR, a foundation that funds AIDS research. Even so, that is an improvement over 2016, when 58 percent weren't using any of them. The strong evidence for medication-assisted treatment has yet to win over not only many treatment providers, but patients themselves. Heather Ramsey, 30, who is six months pregnant, was prescribed one of the medications, buprenorphine, at JourneyPure. Addicted to pain pills and Xanax for half her life, she had finally sought treatment because, she said, ""My body can't take it no more.""

""I feel like I'm kind of, in a sense, cheating the program,"" she said one afternoon in the living room of a residential cottage, adjusting her ponytail after a group meeting with a recovery coach. ""Because I'm still depending on a substance to make me feel normal, and that's not why I came here."" Anti-craving medications are not a silver bullet; relapse is common even among people who take them, and some in fact do better with an abstinence approach. But there is substantial evidence that buprenorphine and a similar drug, methadone -- which has faced ideological resistance on and off for decades -- reduce the mortality rate among people addicted to opioids by half or more; they are also more successful at keeping people in treatment than abstinence-based approaches. A federally funded study last year found that naltrexone, a non-opioid medication that JourneyPure has offered to some patients since it opened in 2015, was just as effective as buprenorphine. But naltrexone, also known by the brand name Vivitrol, is more expensive and people tend not to stay on it as long. It is also harder to start because it requires a long detox period first.

It's true that if medications became the main form of addiction treatment, the pharmaceutical industry would benefit -- an outrageous outcome, critics of the approach believe, given the industry's role in creating the opioid epidemic. But medication-focused treatment would also threaten residential programs like JourneyPure, a for-profit company with locations in Florida and Kentucky as well as Tennessee. It charges an average of $15,000, and up to $26,000, for a monthlong stay, though many of its patients have private insurance that covers most of the cost. Change started to come to the JourneyPure program here in Murfreesboro with the hiring of Mr. Perez as chief executive a year ago. He came from a treatment center in Memphis that has long used medication, and was struck by the resistance to it in Middle Tennessee, where even liberal Nashville still has just one methadone clinic. A few months later, JourneyPure hired Dr. Stephen Loyd, who had been the medical director for the Tennessee Division of Substance Abuse Services. Dr. Loyd himself went through treatment for addiction to painkillers in 2004 and in his state role, became an evangelist for medication-assisted treatment.

Now he has a similar role as medical director for JourneyPure's Middle Tennessee programs, where a few months ago he presented his bosses with a ""manifesto"" outlining how he wanted the company to use medications more aggressively, including by expanding its outpatient clinics and providing buprenorphine to more patients across its sites. ""You've got these two warring factions -- the M.A.T. side and the abstinence-based side,"" he said. ""It's almost like our national politics. Where's the John McCain? Here, it's going to be me."" The medication that JourneyPure and other residential treatment programs use most is naltrexone, because it is not an opioid. It blocks the brain's opioid receptors, preventing any high in patients who try to use opioids while on it. JourneyPure typically offers patients an initial shot near the end of their stay, with the option of returning monthly for more. At Dr. Loyd's urging, JourneyPure has also decided to let residential patients take buprenorphine, also known as Suboxone, if he recommends it. In the past, the company had used the medication only to help detoxing patients get through withdrawal. JourneyPure uses an approach known as trauma-informed care, where patients explore traumatic experiences from their past that might help explain their addiction, and learn new ways to cope. Most patients also have mental illnesses like bipolar disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder that need to be treated, Mr. MacMaster said. Songwriting and spending time with horses not only help people open up and feel valued, company leaders say, but add to the allure of residential treatment. ""If we went purely science-based, nobody would come to treatment because it would be boring,"" Mr. Perez said.

Some of Dr. Loyd's patients have been arrested for taking the very medications that he and many researchers feel are crucial to their recovery. Miranda Nichols, 25, initially came to JourneyPure a year and a half ago for heroin addiction. When she left after a month, she said, she got a Vivitrol shot but it was so expensive -- her co-payment was $600 -- that she never got another. She returned to shooting heroin, then got pregnant and switched to buprenorphine she bought on the street back home in Alabama because, she said, she could not afford the cash-only clinics that prescribed it there. There, she got charged with theft and ""chemical endangerment of a child,"" the latter because she was taking buprenorphine without a prescription. After a stint in jail, she returned to JourneyPure with a court's permission for more treatment. Dr. Loyd, who had just started working at JourneyPure when she returned, put her back on buprenorphine; Ms. Nichols gave birth to a healthy son in June, after spending three months at the treatment center. She is working for a plant company in Nashville and living with the baby at a recovery home that allows buprenorphine. She lost custody of her two older children after her arrest, however. Her case is supposed to go to trial next year, and Dr. Loyd is writing a letter of support. ""People are getting more educated on buprenorphine now,"" Ms. Nichols said. ""They see my story and what kind of person I am, and they see how it actually works.""

Here in Tennessee -- where overdose deaths rose by 9 percent in 2017, to 1,776, the highest number on record -- the state did little to promote medications for addiction treatment until recently. Over the past year, though, it has started doling out federal funds for expanding medication-assisted treatment to 15 nonprofit programs around the state. State health officials are training employees of the programs how to use the medications and, at times, talking them through their reluctance. ""They had to change their business rules, their philosophy,"" said Taryn Sloss, assistant commissioner for the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services. ""A lot of them were abstinence-based and had people in recovery on their boards who thought, 'If it was good enough for me, it's good enough for everyone else.'"" Because they're not eligible for government grants, for-profit companies like JourneyPure don't face as much pressure to embrace medication-assisted treatment. They are regulated through a state licensing process, but Tennessee, like most states, doesn't require medication to be part of their treatment protocol for opioid addiction. Nor do accrediting bodies like the Commission on Accreditation of Rehabilitation Facilities, although the commission has started requiring programs to help patients access medication if they want it. ""We should make it the standard in terms of running a treatment program that's licensed by a state in the 21st century,"" said Michael Botticelli, who served as the drug czar under President Obama and now leads the Grayken Center for Addiction at Boston Medical Center.

It was late summer at JourneyPure; the horses were grazing behind the barn, and a river burbled behind the cluster of cottages where patients live. Around a conference table in the main building, tensions were crackling over medication-assisted treatment. Dr. Loyd was there, as were Mr. MacMaster and Patrick Dunn, the company's chief of operations development. ""There's a small group who will probably need to be on M.A.T. for the rest of their lives,"" said Mr. MacMaster, who quit drugs and alcohol 30 years ago, mostly through 12-step programs. ""But everybody in this room knows drug-free recovery is really the gold standard."" ""I have to disagree,"" Dr. Loyd said. As a state official, he said, he had seen people enter the state's drug court programs on medication, only to be forced by a judge to go off it and pursue abstinence-based treatment. ""These people were vulnerable, at high risk of overdosing and relapse,"" he said. ""We have to keep as many people alive as we can.""

On a frigid December afternoon, a group of JourneyPure patients gathered for dialectical behavior therapy, which teaches mindfulness and ""distress tolerance"" for getting past negative feelings and events. Shannon Siedzik, 26, diligently took notes. She had come from New Jersey to be treated for heroin addiction, her fourth attempt at rehab, she said. Her insurer had approved only a weeklong stay, and she said she wasn't interested in medication -- she'd had an allergic reaction to buprenorphine when she tried it once. Dr. Loyd had met with her that morning and urged her to try methadone, but she was resisting. A JourneyPure discharge planner had already arranged for her to move into a recovery home in Nashville that did not allow any of the medications. ""I feel pretty good leaving here,"" she said, though she added, ""I won't know where to go if that craving happens.""

After therapy, Ms. Siedzik returned to the house she was sharing with a dozen other women for a 12-step meeting led by a JourneyPure recovery coach. Following the meeting, Christmas music tinkled and several housemates prepared dinner while she stared out the window. Dr. Loyd's plea had jarred her. ""He's worried about me relapsing and overdosing and dying,"" she said quietly. ""It upsets me because it's kind of true. It scares me -- like, a lot."" Dr. Loyd had urged her to call Nashville's only methadone clinic once she left JourneyPure and offered to help find her a spot at a different recovery home that allowed medication. ""It's not a bad idea,"" she said. ""But I'm thinking about the future, getting off of it -- how hard will that be?"" The next morning Ms. Siedzik got a ride to a recovery home indistinguishable from all the other houses on the street in a neighborhood about 15 minutes from downtown Nashville. She hoped to get a Narcotics Anonymous sponsor, a job waitressing and a spot on a recreational soccer team. A week later, she had not called the methadone clinic and said she felt happy with where she had landed.",A reluctant evolution is taking place in residential drug treatment for opioid addiction.

Economy,Unavoidable Answer for the Problem of Climate Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/business/economy/unavoidable-answer-to-problem-of-climate-change.html,"Workers removing fuel rods from one of the reactors at the Daiichi plant in Fukushima, Japan, site of a nuclear accident in 2011.

Japan's announcement last week that it would not meet its promise to sharply reduce its carbon emissions met a chorus of disapproval from around the world. Delegates at the international climate talks in Warsaw, which end Friday, lamented Japan's move as a blow to worldwide efforts to slow global warming. In the Philippines, which is still collecting the dead from Typhoon Hayan, it served as yet another example of the indifference of the rich world to the plight of the world's poorest nations on the front lines of climate change. But Japan's about-face on its climate promises -- which followed the government's decision to shut down its nuclear power generators after the meltdown at the Daiichi nuclear plant in Fukushima -- is also an opportunity for a reality check in the debate over how to slow the accumulation of greenhouse gases warming the atmosphere. It brings into sharp focus the most urgent challenge: How will the world replace fossil fuels? Can it be done fast enough, cheaply enough and on a sufficient scale without nuclear energy? For all the optimism about the prospects of wind, sun and tides to power our future, the evidence suggests the answer is no.

Scrambling to find an alternative fuel to generate some 30 percent of its power, Japan had no choice but to turn to coal and gas. A few years ago, it promised that in 2020 it would produce 25 percent less greenhouse gas emissions than in 1990; last week it said it would, instead, produce 3 percent more. Japan is unlikely to be the only country to miss its targets. In response to the Fukushima disaster, Germany shut down eight nuclear reactors and said it would close the remaining nine by 2022. Everybody is promising to fill the gap with renewables. So far, however, coal and natural gas have won out. CO2 emissions in Germany actually increased 1 percent last year, even as they declined in the United States and most of Western Europe. Between 2010 and 2012, worldwide consumption of nuclear energy shrank 7 percent. Over the same period, the consumption of coal, the dirtiest fuel and the worst global warming offender, rose 4.5 percent. Data released on Tuesday by the Global Carbon Project confirmed that coal accounted for over half the growth in fossil fuel emissions in 2012. With energy consumption expected to grow by more than half over the next 30 years, the odds seem low that the world can avoid catastrophic warming without carbon-free nuclear power.

Opponents of nuclear energy say the case for nuclear power underestimates its costs and unique risks, including the fact that no other energy source can produce the sudden devastation of a nuclear meltdown. And they say that nuclear proponents overstate the challenge that renewable energy faces in replacing fossil fuels. But while investment in renewable sources is crucially important to meet new energy needs, nuclear power remains the cheapest and most readily scalable of the alternative energy sources. Difficult as it may be to reduce dependence on coal, nuclear power is probably the world's best shot. Take the Energy Information Agency's estimate of the cost of generating power. The agency's number-crunchers include everything from the initial investment to the cost of fuel and the expense to operate, maintain and decommission old plants. Its latest estimate, published earlier this year, suggests that power generated by a new-generation nuclear plant that entered service in 2018 would be $108.40 per megawatt-hour. (A megawatt-hour is enough to supply an hour's worth of electricity to about 1,000 American homes.) This is not cheap. Even if the government were to impose a carbon tax of $15 per metric ton of CO2, a coal-fired plant would generate power at $100.10 to $135.50 per MWh, depending on the technology. Plants using natural gas could produce electricity for as little as $65.60 per MWh, even after paying the carbon tax. Still, nuclear power is likely to be cheaper than most power made with renewables. Land-based wind farms could generate power at a relatively low cost of $86.60 per MWh, but acceptable locations are growing increasingly scarce. Solar costs $144.30 per MWh, the agency estimates. A megawatt-hour of power fueled by an offshore wind farm costs a whopping $221.50. Even these comparisons underestimate the challenges faced in developing wind and solar power on a large scale. They might be clean and plentiful sources, but they require expensive transmission lines from where the sun shines and the wind blows to where the power is needed. Moreover, the sun doesn't shine at least half the time. The wind doesn't always blow. And we don't yet know how to store electricity generated on hot summer days to use on cold winter nights. The sun has provided half of Germany's power on some days. On others it has provided next to nothing. It's not easy to build a power network, let alone an economy, on the basis of such an unreliable energy source.

Perhaps the most levelheaded estimate of the relative cost of alternative fuels comes from the British government, which earlier this year published the price it was prepared to guarantee power generators as an incentive to develop renewable sources. The exercise underscored just how uncompetitive alternative sources of energy are, compared with coal and gas. It also revealed that nuclear power generated at a new plant in Somerset was expected to be significantly cheaper. The British government offered to guarantee a price of PS92.50 per MWh of power generated at the Somerset plant. For offshore wind, the guarantees ranged from PS155 per MWh at plants starting next year to PS135 per MWh for those starting in 2018. What about the danger of nuclear power? What about the fish swimming in cesium-laced waters off the coast of Japan or the tens of thousands of evacuees fleeing radioactive fallout? In 2007 The Lancet medical journal published a study comparing deaths and illnesses associated with different sources of electricity -- both from environmental pollution and accidents. Nuclear energy, it found, was about the safest around. Nuclear energy was responsible for 0.003 accidental deaths per terawatt-hour generated. Coal-fired electricity accounted for 15 times as many. ""More than 10 years of operations would be needed before a single occupational death could be attributed to the plant"" at a new French reactor, wrote the authors, Anil Markandya from the University of Bath and Paul Wilkinson from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Chernobyl, the worst nuclear accident in history, produced 50 additional deaths from cancer in 20 years, according to a study by 100 scientists from eight United Nations agencies. Of 800,000 people exposed to its radiation, a maximum of 4,000 may eventually die from cancer, according to the World Health Organization.","Opponents call attention to the dire risks of nuclear energy, but in the push to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, it may be the world's best shot.",c358ab85-a5c6-542c-bf58-8ffee6135ea7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/29/business/eduardo-porter/eduardo-porter-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2013&h=900&w=600&s=51cd117ec6c917ef3e71b1dd553f6475d3027b60f8541bba029947ee0c0cdda9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Eduardo Porter,c358ab85-a5c6-542c-bf58-8ffee6135ea7,N24News/imgs/c358ab85-a5c6-542c-bf58-8ffee6135ea7.jpg,8
Dance,Alonzo King and Jason Moran Create a Dialogue of Movement and Music,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/16/arts/dance/alonzo-king-jason-moran-vail-dance.html,"The choreographer Alonzo King, left, and the composer and jazz pianist Jason Moran, during a rehearsal for their yet to be titled new work, which will premiere at the Vail Dance Festival.





When the Vail International Dance Festival proposed to Alonzo King that he choreograph a new work featuring four members of his San Francisco company, Lines Ballet, and four from New York City Ballet, he knew just what he needed: a partner. ""The music is the thing, isn't it?"" he said. ""A composer whose music you treasure and that you've worked with before and are going to work with again."" For Mr. King, that had to be the jazz pianist Jason Moran. This summer, as part of the Vail festival, which opens on July 26, the pair will present the premiere of their latest collaboration. So far, it doesn't have a title.

""It's hard for me to name the baby,"" Mr. King explained, ""until it's really born."" The two will be putting finishing touches on the work in Colorado ahead of its premiere on Aug. 3. It's the fourth collaboration between Mr. King and Mr. Moran, who have relished working together from the start. Their first artistic venture, ""Refraction,"" debuted in 2009, and their fifth, which includes the jazz musician Charles Lloyd, will happen this fall with Lines. The success of their artistic connection, Mr. King said, is rooted in how they are able to create space, allowing a dialogue to happen between the music and the dance.

""Who is going to lead here?"" Mr. King said. ""Who will be the principal instrument here? Will it be the dancer, will it be the sound? With Jason, it was just immediate that he could serve the dance. And it's inevitable that he's going to make great music."" For Damian Woetzel, the artistic director of Vail, who commissioned the piece, part of what inspired it was the reaction -- particularly by City Ballet dancers -- to a Lines performance last summer there. ""Some of the dancers were gobsmacked,"" Mr. Woetzel said. ""That started a conversation: Wouldn't it be amazing to have Alonzo do a new piece for the festival? And what if it was his dancers with City Ballet dancers? Alonzo quickly proposed Jason Moran, and I said, Oh my God."" ""We're just in this beautiful opportunity,"" he added, ""for people to learn from each other and make something together on a different level.""

In considering collaborations, Mr. King said, he enjoyed them when they seemed ""tricky or potentially perilous."" And there is a prickly side to this one: Mr. King, after all, walked into the first rehearsal knowing only half of his cast: Adji Cissoko, Madeline DeVries , Shuaib Elhassan and Michael Montgomery, from Lines. Mr. Woetzel selected the dancers from City Ballet: Miriam Miller, Unity Phelan, Christopher Grant and Roman Mejia. ""That was really cool, because it was trust,"" Mr. Kin g said. ""I had no say in it, and that was fine with me, and it turned out that Damian chose amazing people."" Most important, the City Ballet performers were open and receptive. Mr. King said that he had walked into big companies in which a leading dancer might not want to veer from what was comfortable. ""So when you have dancers who are willing to try new things,"" he said, ""and who aren't narrowed down by a small definition of 'I do this' or 'I do that,' but think of themselves as an artist capable of anything, that's fun.""

Mr. Moran laughed. ""I'm not a choreographer,"" he continued. ""I only know about how my body feels when I play it. So I think in all collaborations, you're not necessarily looking for people who simply give you what's on the top of your head. We want to dig deep together, and that's what this allows."" While, to his regret, Mr. Moran wasn't trained as a dancer, he is profoundly affected by movement -- and that includes his own. ""If I'm not moving while I'm playing, "" he said, ""I know the music is bad. That means something is stuck."" Mr. Moran said that he had to make sure that he did not think of a sound as done once he had played the note, but ""that it is still moving in the air and running into people's bodies,"" he said. ""I guess in working with Alonzo and dancers, you really are allowed to see it or what it triggers."" The new work's score is spare and poignant, building toward a powerful finale to which the dancers move in unison. Here, Mr. King is continuing to explore a theme that has been at the root of his recent series of ballets. ""It's this idea of communal harmony and unspoken contracts,"" he said. ""There's something about chemistry and the manipulation of energies and how they're placed. You're building an architecture, and it's based on the building materials, which are the dancers. You're really creating something that's living and formed out of who they are, and what the ideas are in the room."" Mr. King's dancers are both free and precise; they possess an uninhibited consciousness of their bodies in space. As Ms. Phelan, of City Ballet, said, ""They're not afraid to try anything.""

Mr. King's approach to ballet technique has a philosophical side: His clear understanding of anatomy is a given, but on top of that is his transcendent way of discussing the motivation and mechanics behind a step. While working with the dancers last month, he focused on the tendu, a basic yet integral ballet step that involves stretching the foot out while keeping it in contact with the floor. ""You want to get as many angles as you can in the spectrum,"" Mr. King said, as he opened his arms to show that the action wasn't limited solely to the leg. ""Where do I tendu from?"" he said. ""Navel to finger. Navel to shoulder. So you radiate. You want to see rays."" Pyrotechnics and self-aware displays of skill don't hold much weight for Mr. King, whose movement is characterized by an ever-expanding fluidity. He is drawn to finding balance between the heart and the mind -- ""when there is a keen intelligence, but it's balanced by the heart of a mother,"" he said. ""I often ask the dancers, regardless of sex, where is the mother in you?""

To the willowy Ms. Miller, he said: ""I would love to see you do too much. What you think 'too much' is. You're always the nice girl. I want to see your full power. Scare me."" For Ms. Phelan, the experience has been a gift. ""You want to give him everything, but he's not expecting the world from you,"" she said. ""He just wants your best. He kept saying, 'You're just trying to be beautiful -- I want you to be a beast, I want people to be afraid of you.'"" ""I wrote that down,"" she added. ""I wrote down a lot of the things that he said so I'll have them to look at when I need inspiration."" As Mr. King sees it, dancing -- and collaboration -- is about ceaseless exploration. ""There are so many ways to view something, to interpret something, to participate in something,"" he said. ""To ask yourself: What is my motive? What does it mean in terms of science? What does it mean in terms of emotion and feeling? A lyricist needs a great singer, a great interpreter. The choreographer is the lyricist, and the dancer is the singer.""","Mr. King likes collaborations that are ""tricky or potentially perilous."" His next one is for the Vail International Dance Festival.",ccec6260-32aa-51bb-8eaa-4b336001b639,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/21/arts/21king-moran-1/21king-moran-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=f78efc3c918f2304bf06d4f9d2f605a50eddb36c4a8928778c7bfa0fa085b9cf&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mr. King at a rehearsal, working with the dancers for the Vail premiere.

Health,Drug Company Under Fire After Revealing Dengue Vaccine May Harm Some,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/health/sanofi-dengue-vaccine-philippines.html,"The first promising vaccine for dengue -- a disease that afflicts hundreds of millions of people around the world -- is in jeopardy after the Philippines suspended it, amid widespread fears about its safety and growing public anger over its use in 830,000 schoolchildren. The Philippines government has begun investigations into the rollout of the immunization program by the French drugmaker Sanofi, which has come under fire for discounting early warnings that its vaccine could put some people at heightened risk of a severe form of the disease. The newly revealed evidence, confirmed recently by Sanofi's review of study data, found that in rare cases, Dengvaxia can backfire: If people who never had dengue are vaccinated and later become infected, the vaccine may provoke a much more severe form of the illness. The situation has become a public-relations debacle for the drugmaker, which spent decades developing Dengvaxia, the world's first dengue vaccine. Politicians in the Philippines are demanding information about Sanofi's advertising campaign and their government's aggressive push, against the advice of some experts, to vaccinate a million children.

The backlash has alarmed researchers who worry that Sanofi's stumble could stoke mistrust in vaccines around the globe. Sanofi's vaccine is approved in 19 countries and is the first to combat dengue, a disease spread by mosquitoes that infects about 400 million people worldwide. It puts 500,000 people in the hospital each year and kills 25,000, mostly in Latin America and South Asia. Infection rates can reach 90 percent in the Philippines, according to Sanofi. Death rates are highest among children, and just last week a 7-year-old girl who had not been vaccinated died from dengue in the Philippines, according to news reports there. Late last month, Sanofi said its new analysis showed that vaccination should not be recommended for people who have never had dengue, advice that was echoed this past week by the World Health Organization. But that only adds to the confusion, because there is no rapid test to tell if someone has had the disease. Even though the risk from the vaccine is low, families fear it has turned their children into time bombs, in whom the virus could set off a life-threatening illness. Leovon Deyro, whose youngest son received his last injection of the vaccine two weeks ago, said he suspects that Sanofi conspired with corrupt Philippine officials to circumvent regulations, something the company has denied.

""We weren't told it was not safe,"" Mr. Deyro said. So far, he said, his son, who is 10, has had no worrying symptoms. But, he added, ""They made my son and other students as guinea pigs."" The Philippine health secretary, Francisco T. Duque III, said the government is demanding a refund from Sanofi for the 3.5 billion Philippine pesos, or about $69 million, it spent on the vaccine. It is also asking the company to set up a fund to cover the treatment of any children who develop severe dengue. ""It's been very devastating for almost the entire country,"" said Dr. Leonila Dans, an epidemiologist and pediatrician at the University of the Philippines in Manila who had been an early critic of the vaccination program. ""Even those who are not vaccinated are very emotional about it, because they feel for the kids who had the vaccine."" The episode could prove to be a cautionary tale for pharmaceutical companies, who have already been reluctant to invest in vaccines and drugs that are used mainly in the developing world.

Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University, said, ""It's hard to think of another circumstance when a major public health program was introduced with this much controversy."" The problems with the vaccine rollout have ""cast a pall"" on other efforts to develop dengue vaccines, he said, and public health experts are worried that the distrust could spill over to other vaccination programs. ""Vaccines have plenty of controversy,"" Dr. Schaffner said. ""We don't need to make more."" Sanofi has said that the risk to people who get the vaccine is still extremely small. Moreover, in those who have previously been infected, the vaccine works well. In people older than 9, Dengaxia is about 66 percent effective. It is even more effective -- 81.9 percent -- in those over 9 who were previously infected.

But that has not allayed fears in the Philippines, where Sanofi has said 10 percent of the children who were vaccinated probably had no prior exposure to the virus. Dr. Su-Peing Ng, the head of medical affairs of Sanofi Pasteur, the company's vaccine division, said in an interview that ""there is no cause for alarm,"" adding, ""those vaccinated in high-exposure settings are much more protected than those who were not."" The World Health Organization, which published guidelines on how to use the vaccine in 2016, has distanced itself. ""We did not give a blanket recommendation that the vaccine should be introduced,"" said W.H.O.'s representative in the Philippines, Dr. Gundo Weiler. ""This is a decision for governments and governments alone.""

""It's a huge disappointment and it's a big lesson in humility,"" said Michel De Wilde, the former senior vice president of research and development at Sanofi Pasteur, who oversaw the vaccine's development until he left the company in 2013. The illness, also called breakbone fever, can be excruciating, with high fevers, headaches, muscle and joint pains and lingering weakness. Sometimes the disease causes hemorrhage or shock, which can be fatal. Some deadly cases have been linked to the fact that there are actually four different types of dengue virus. Research has found that severe illness can occur in people who had one type and later become infected by another. The body's immune response to the first virus is thought to make the second illness worse, a discovery credited to Dr. Scott B. Halstead, who has been studying dengue since the 1960s. In February 2016, as the Philippine program was getting underway, Dr. Halstead warned in a scientific article that the vaccine could put people at risk if they had not previously had dengue. He said the issue was well known. ""We've been talking about this for years,"" he said recently. ""It isn't any hidden secret."" He and others pointed to a trial of Dengvaxia in children, published in 2015, that seemed to confirm fears that the vaccine could be harmful to those with no previous exposure. The potential danger is not from the vaccine itself, but from the immune response to it. The researchers found that in children under 9 years old, those who were given Dengvaxia and later caught dengue were more likely to be hospitalized for severe illness than those who had not been vaccinated. The finding originally led Sanofi to restrict Dengvaxia to children 9 and older, although the company did not concede that the higher hospitalization rate among younger children was due to their lack of prior dengue exposure. A panel set up by the World Health Organization recommended that the vaccine be used only in places where the incidence of dengue was high. Brazil decided to limit its government program to people who are over age 15. Even as Sanofi pushed back against researchers' warnings about the vaccine's potential hazards, it ordered another analysis of the data.

Dr. Ng, the Sanofi official, said that before the additional analysis, ""there wasn't a robust way in which we could answer that question. It's only this new analysis that has given us this insight."" The new analysis found that lack of past infection was tied to an increased risk of severe dengue. But the risk was small -- two extra cases per 1,000 previously uninfected people vaccinated, over five years of follow-up. And there were no deaths reported. But how to tell if someone has had dengue? Doctors and patients cannot always tell because symptoms can be vague. No rapid test exists. Current tests take a few days to produce results, and may have trouble distinguishing dengue from Zika, a related virus. Trying to use them would further complicate a vaccination process that is already cumbersome, because it requires three visits. Sanofi has said it will invest in efforts to develop a better test. At a Philippine Senate hearing on Dec. 11, Thomas Triomphe, a regional Sanofi official, emphasized the vaccine's benefits and said that to permanently remove it would leave 90 percent of the population ""at the mercy of an epidemic which has been found to be preventable."" But parents feel they have traded one risk for another that might be worse. Maria Brenal Bernal said her daughter, Reyna Rose, had been sick on and off since receiving her first shot of Dengvaxia in August.

In 2016, Dengvaxia brought in 55 million euros, or about $65 million, which fell far short of the 200 million euros the company had previously estimated. Sanofi has recorded 22 million euros in sales of Dengvaxia for the first three quarters of this year, or about $26 million. Experts in infectious diseases say the vaccine is too valuable to be abandoned. ""If we wait for the perfect vaccine, we will probably be talking about this 50 years from now,"" said Duane Gubler, an emeritus professor at Duke-NUS Medical School, who favors using the vaccine, especially where dengue is highly endemic. He is one of the inventors of a competing dengue vaccine made by Takeda and has consulted in the past for Sanofi.

The Takeda vaccine and another by the United States National Institutes of Health, which will be mainly sold by Merck, could be approved for use soon. According to the research so far, the N.I.H. vaccine, which is administered in a single dose, ""gives a very potent response against all four of the serotypes,"" said Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, which is overseeing the vaccine's development. Some analysts said Sanofi's struggles could have a chilling effect on investment in vaccines, which are greatly needed in developing countries. ""I think anybody who deals in emerging markets noticed this one,"" said Les Funtleyder, a health care portfolio manager at E Squared Capital Management who invests in domestic and emerging markets. He said that many investors were likely to ""ask the big companies, why are you doing this? It's like, all risk, no reward.""",A promising vaccine for dengue fever is in limbo after the Philippines suspended its use amid widespread public anger and fears about its safety.,66ae85ab-0314-57d9-898b-c32ae1635d42,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/18/science/00DENGUE1/00DENGUE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1654e7b5a68e1fd8e0daad3bd12ac90e791097444901c12dc4f6bbf7363cdad3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Iran Lustre, resting at home in Las Pinas, south of Manila in the Philippines, received three shots of the dengue vaccine Dengvaxia.

Sports,"The Milwaukee Bucks Are Back, but They're Not Leaving Activism Behind",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/29/sports/basketball/milwaukee-bucks-Game-5-jacob-blake.html,"The Milwaukee Bucks knelt during the national anthem before Game 5 of their playoff series against Orlando, which was postponed on Wednesday after the Bucks refused to play.





LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. -- It is bound to be forgotten with time that the Milwaukee Bucks, determined as they were in their pursuit of social justice, merely wanted to forfeit a basketball game Wednesday. The Bucks initially believed that they could stage a one-game, spur-of-the-moment walkout, even during the N.B.A. playoffs, without far-reaching consequences. Let's just say they underestimated the gravity of that stance. What is sure to be remembered as one of the most tumultuous weeks in league history all started with the Bucks refusing to emerge from their locker room to face the Orlando Magic. The 2019-20 Bucks are thus destined to be memorialized as the fed-up group that responded to a police shooting in their home state with a protest conceived minutes before a playoff game was set to tip-off. In that moment, Milwaukee unexpectedly brought the N.B.A.'s maiden summer postseason to a sudden halt -- and ultimately forced players leaguewide to decide if they wanted to keep playing or burst the league's so-called bubble altogether. Convinced that they should not play after Jacob Blake, a Black man, was shot several times by the police in Kenosha, Wis., these Bucks likewise inspired a momentous wave of protests against racism and police brutality throughout North American sports. The resulting fallout prompted N.B.A. team owners to pledge that arenas all over the league would be used as voting sites in November. ""I think it's great we all came to the bubble, and it's great when we kneel together for the national anthem,"" said Michael Carter-Williams of the Magic. ""It's great that we took a stand, but where's the real action?""

Yet the Bucks were greeted by new demands on Saturday afternoon -- and they presumably felt the degree of difficulty more acutely than any of the teams still alive at Walt Disney World given the scrutiny they have invited. After all the activism, Milwaukee had to return to the basketball grind and play out the Game 5 that was ultimately postponed Wednesday. A ragged 118-104 victory over the short-handed Magic to finally finish this first-round series, with Orlando slicing a 17-point halftime deficit down to 3 points in the fourth quarter, made for a somewhat unconvincing send-off to the three upcoming best-of-seven rounds that await Bucks in their pursuit of a championship. ""This group wants to do both,"" Bucks Coach Mike Budenholzer said, ""and fight for both."" He was referring to his team's twin aims of using the high-profile platform provided by the N.B.A. restart to continue combating systemic racism while staying on a path that could lead to the Bucks' first title since the days of Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Oscar Robertson in 1971.

Of course, even with Giannis Antetokounmpo -- who amassed 28 points and 17 rebounds in Saturday's clincher -- that won't be easy given everything swirling around this team. ""It was challenging,"" Antetokounmpo said, referring far more to the strain of the occasion than his second-half foul trouble that helped fuel Orlando's rally. ""I would say it was very difficult today,"" said Milwaukee's Khris Middleton, who contributed 21 points, 10 rebounds and 7 assists. Budenholzer admitted that he ""actually wondered which locker room"" the Bucks would be assigned. It was indeed the same converted storage room at the AdventHealth Arena at the ESPN Wide World of Sports complex, with a maximum occupancy of 49 people, where the Bucks made the collective call Wednesday to stay inside. ""You felt something going back in there,"" Budenholzer said.

All around the N.B.A.'s campus, after an emotional 48 hours in the wake of the Bucks' walkout, there appeared to be a renewed belief among players this weekend that they could once again campaign effectively against systemic racism and voter suppression from within the bubble. Frustration on those fronts had been mounting even before the Blake shooting and the subsequent uproar; numerous players had complained that league-approved social justice messaging on jerseys and ""Black Lives Matter"" lettering on the floor were no longer resonating. The uncomfortable basketball truth for the Bucks, though, is that they had left the impression they were having an unhappy time at Disney World long before the chaos of recent days. Antetokounmpo and Co. held the league's best record (53-12) on March 11, when the N.B.A. season was suspended indefinitely in response to the coronavirus outbreak, but they have scarcely looked like that team during their eight-week stay in Florida.

While Toronto, Boston and Miami were completing impressive first-round sweeps in the East, Milwaukee stumbled to a Game 1 loss to the injury-riddled Magic, who played the entire series without Aaron Gordon (hamstring), Jonathan Isaac (knee) and Carter-Williams (foot), each having sustained their injuries in the bubble. Antetokounmpo already looked to have lost his patience more than once during the Bucks' eight seeding games -- scuffling with the Nets' Donta Hall and earning a one-game suspension for head-butting Washington's Moritz Wagner -- and must now contend with a Heat team that is not only well-rested but appears to have adapted to the restrictive rigors of bubble life better than most. The Magic, who were the first of 22 teams to arrive at Disney World on July 7, have spent this whole trip less than 25 miles from their Amway Center home and were able to begin leaving the bubble immediately on Saturday night because of that proximity. The Bucks avoided embarrassment in this restart-within-a-restart thanks to two key 3-pointers in the fourth quarter from the substitute Marvin Williams, restoring a cushion despite the absence of a foul-plagued Antetokounmpo, but questions persist about their championship viability -- especially with the Raptors, Celtics and Heat all suddenly conspiring to make the oft-lampooned East feel deeper than usual. How much such questions even matter now, mind you, is debatable. These Bucks, no matter what happens on the court from here, have made an indelible mark on an N.B.A. season like no other. That may not inspire much calm for the fans back in Milwaukee, who have been fretting over Antetokounmpo's future for months -- amid the fervent hope in many other cities that the Greek supernova will spurn a long-term contract extension if the Bucks fail to win it all. Yet this is hardly the time to contemplate such matters. Wesley Matthews, one of Antetokounmpo's teammates, made that clear when he spoke at length about a conversation that the Bucks had with Blake's family as the whirlwind of Wednesday's walkout was taking hold. ""We didn't need any other validation after talking to them about what we did,"" Matthews said. Antetokounmpo added: ""That's bigger than basketball to me. We're going to remember the way we felt for the rest of our lives.""","""This group wants to do both,"" Coach Mike Budenholzer said of pursuing a championship without abandoning the team's efforts to combat police brutality and systemic racism.",51c2eb9c-5a8a-55bd-9d34-198687ef09d1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/29/sports/29stein-nba/merlin_176343003_120139b9-6148-4c2c-917b-ee2706a0ad7e-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=cab8d19129739f6acfc23efb61a8477211ce4433bc0fc2ad4df0469842b12fa1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Milwaukee Bucks knelt during the national anthem before Game 5 of their playoff series against Orlando, which was postponed on Wednesday after the Bucks refused to play.&nbsp;",51c2eb9c-5a8a-55bd-9d34-198687ef09d1,N24News/imgs/51c2eb9c-5a8a-55bd-9d34-198687ef09d1.jpg,9
Travel,Looking Beyond Tel Aviv for Israel's New Restaurant Scene,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/travel/looking-beyond-tel-aviv-for-israels-new-restaurant-scene.html,"The Israeli chef Snir Eng-Sela was leading the kitchen at Commerce, Harold Moore' s now-closed American nouveau restaurant in the West Village, when he realized he'd had enough. He was living in a cramped one-bedroom in the West Village with his wife and their 4-year-old daughter Mya. Mr. Eng-Sela had spent years clawing his way up the restaurant-world ladder, graduating from the Culinary Institute of America before learning on his feet at Santi Santamaria's Michelin-starred Can Fabes in Catalonia and the once stalwart Tribeca French institution Montrachet. From there, it was a sous chef slot at Dan Barber's Blue Hill, and then a turn at Mr. Barber's Blue Hill at Stone Barns. All of this had led him to Commerce, where bartenders were mixing $17 cocktails, avocado was served on spelt and flaxseed toast, and ingredients like pickled ramps and Parmesan foam crowded the menu . He was craving simplicity and space. So in 2011, he and his family came back to the suburbs of Tel Aviv, moving into the house once owned by Mr. Eng-Sela's grandfather. But Tel Aviv had changed in the decades Mr. Eng-Sela was gone, and with its flashy new restaurants and sky-high rents, looked a lot like the New York that he had just fled.

""It was definitely not the same country that I had left,"" he said. So when he was approached by the owners of Gouje and Danielle, a rustic bistro on Israel's Sharon Plain, the fresh air alone was enough to make him say yes. It's been a decade or so since the Tel Aviv gastronomic scene came to global attention, catapulting local sons like Meir Adoni and Eyal Shani to success in Paris and New York. But amid the din and rising prices that comes with so much hype, Tel Aviv restaurateurs are now moving north in search of quieter pastures. Like Mr. Eng-Sela, many have settled in the Sharon Plain , which stretches across the coastal lowlands between Haifa and Tel Aviv, south from Mount Carmel down to the banks of the Yarkon River. A string of new chef-run restaurants is transforming this once-sleepy patch into Israel's newest culinary destination.

Seasonal specialties, based on whatever produce is at peak freshness, are rotated alongside a set menu of classics including hand-rolled Calamarata, a thick, ring-shaped pasta, with white grouper; a trademark root vegetable salad with citrus dressing, and Venetian-style veal schnitzel. The restaurant also offers a farm-style brunch buffet, in which diners serve themselves from a long table heaped with roasted vegetables, local cheeses, freshly baked breads, smoked fish and more. ""I feel like the dining experience outside of Tel Aviv is better now,"" says Mr. Eng-Sela. ""The guests that come are more open-minded and more at ease. And for me, to be able to do genuinely good food without the cutthroat environment of New York or Tel Aviv, it means I can have a family and still work as a chef.""

He isn't alone. Just outside the quiet town of Karkur, a former protege of Alain Ducasse, the multiply Michelin-starred chef, has built a temple of sourdough and yeast on the grounds of a quiet kibbutz. Eldad Shmueli, the former executive chef of Tel Aviv hot spot Claro, always dreamed of having his own restaurant in the Israeli countryside, which he finally realized in 2016 when he opened Elchanan-Breads Bakery on Kibbutz Mishmarot. It's an unassuming spot -- until you sidle up to the counter and view the wares on offer: knafe croissants -- a Middle East remix of the Cronut, featuring phyllo dough and soft white cheese; chocolate babka with a glaze so thick you can see your reflection; and the breakfast-for-two platters packed with local eggs, fresh and roasted vegetables, cheeses and an entire loaf of bread. ""It's not easy to make a high-end style restaurant outside of Tel Aviv, which is one of the reasons I chose to do a bakery,"" Mr. Shmueli says. ""Yes, I love baking, but also it's still part of the dream, which is simply to make food.""

They were successful, which was a problem. What had started out as a tiny seafood stall on the beach, inspired by Mr. Zidon's post-army travels in Thailand, morphed over the years into an enterprise of 50 workers. He decided to sell and head to the Sharon. Ms. Zidon, an artist and photographer, opened a small furniture and design studio, and by night, her own refurbished chairs and tables doubled as seating for Thai Machteret (Thai Underground), Mr. Zidon's pint-size Thai street food spot. Word spread quickly and diners would line up for an hour or more on Ms. Zidon's hand-painted benches for a spot. This summer, Mr. Zidon moved into a new space nearby, taking over the milking parlor of an abandoned agricultural school and converting it into a dining room that can seat 70. The move also granted him a quarter acre of land, which he is turning into a Thai vegetable and herb garden.","In the coastal lowlands outside the country's bustling, second-largest city, a quiet dining hub is blossoming, with food rooted in the land.",9ebab300-7b68-5a41-8c63-3da04560a610,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/21/travel/21israel-food-opener/21israel-food-opener-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=44dfc299965f11a52e04843dcc055a47637d7aae0b4a170430a6a54e8f20772f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Helena is so close to the waves in Caesarea, the biggest seaside town on the Sharon Plain, that sea spray hits the windows.",9ebab300-7b68-5a41-8c63-3da04560a610,N24News/imgs/9ebab300-7b68-5a41-8c63-3da04560a610.jpg,4
Dance,Review: 'The Sleeping Beauty' Spurs American Ballet Theater to Work on the Details,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/arts/dance/review-the-sleeping-beauty-spurs-american-ballet-theater-to-work-on-the-details.html,"As American Ballet Theater gave a series of performances of its new production of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" last week, it was easy to spot ways in which things could sound and look better. Tchaikovsky's score should have been better played (especially by the brass and wind sections) and been more sensitively conducted, and Richard Hudson's sets (inspired by Bakst) deserved to be lighted considerably better than they have been by James B. Ingalls. And the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, who is in charge of the whole production, has paid least attention to the most theatrically difficult part of this demanding ballet: the prince's arrival at the sleeping palace and the awakening of the heroine Aurora, her parents and their court. It's the only part of his production when everything lapses into ballet cliche, with none of the telling details that turn the rest of this work into absorbingly poetic drama. Let's hope Mr. Ratmansky, Mr. Hudson, Mr. Ingalls and Ballet Theater's music team regard this as a work in progress. There is already much for us to love, much for the company to take pride in and many details that help Tchaikovsky's superlative score become more absorbing than ever before. Ballet Theater, which doesn't always look like a united company, proves one in breadth and depth here -- not least because it is musically attentive. And we're reminded that no ballet better showcases the way in which a company operates and the style for which it aims. This production has been advantageous for almost every dancer in the company. It remains hard to believe how attentive Mr. Ratmansky has made everyone -- not least the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House -- to small details of footwork and gesture, by a combination of musical delicacy, unmannered physicality and lively humanity. The Met is an overly vast hangar, but Mr. Ratmansky is creating a style that makes it feel like an intimate chamber. Yes, Ballet Theater -- long an exponent of big, bashing, weary, repertory war horses -- is becoming a company of real charm. Who'd have thunk it?

Several corps dancers do three or four roles in an evening, and some of those parts are big advances in their careers. Gabe Stone Shayer (his large, beaming face lights up the Met), usually a cavalier in the Prologue and a Garland dancer in Act I, has been an impressive Bluebird, buoyant and sweet, in Act III. Cassandra Trenary, who also dances in ensembles in the Prologue and Act I, has shown sparkling delicacy in Act III as both the Diamond Fairy and Princess Florine. Other dancers bringing distinction to solo roles have included Skylar Brandt, April Giangeruso, Arron Scott and Paulina Waski, usually in the same performances as they dance in the corps. At principal level, Isabella Boylston, who at some performances makes a brilliant impression in the supporting roles of the Diamond Fairy and Princess Florine, is in dance terms the most dazzling interpreter of the central role of Princess Aurora; no ballerina in the company brings such elan to individual steps or such eagerness to that role. Diana Vishneva, though more experienced, brings more bloom to this heroine; her personal luster is extraordinary. Hee Seo, monochrome in some other ballets, fills the role with marvelous light and shade. Veronika Part, a Lilac Fairy of long experience, now radiates the mature generosity that this part is all about; on Thursday evening, her performance was the most wonderful thing in the whole ballet. Marcelo Gomes, who as Prince Desire delivers the taxing intricacies of his solo variation at the peak of an exemplary account of the role, also performs as the evil fairy, Carabosse, with splendidly venomous force. Cory Stearns, whose nobility has become nuanced by humor, reflectiveness and poignancy, takes the character of Desire through a true journey. At soloist level, Joseph Gorak, who often dances among the Fairy Cavaliers beside Mr. Shayer and Mr. Scott, is another Bluebird and prince of note. Although his acting can acquire more weight and his partnering more ease, he is now the company's foremost male coloratura dancer. Sarah Lane, the most royal of the company's Auroras in bearing, is also the most diffident; yet the phrasing she brought to the beginning of the Act I violin variation was of unmatched musical firmness and radiance. Stella Abrera, Christine Shevchenko and Roman Zhurbin are others who have grown notably in artistry. What characterizes the style of Ballet Theater's ""Beauty""? Acting and dance instincts overlap as dancers draw color from the score; dance line becomes a matter of newly subtle variety; and we see how Marius Petipa, the ballet's 1890 choreographer, welcomed multiplicity and simultaneity of stage action. Early in the Prologue, the King is downstage chatting to some courtiers about what a good looker his baby daughter, Aurora, will grow up to be. Meanwhile the Queen is upstage conversing with court ladies around the cradle, and the M.C., Catalabutte, is soliloquizing himself up into a lather of fretful anticipation -- all at the same time, all in mime gestures, and all endearingly human.

The dancing is equally layered. When the six fairy godmothers arrive, there are passages in which they, their eight attendants and four of their cavaliers are all dancing at once, like three orchestral groups in harmony. (Two of the cavaliers don't dance, so we also see how Petipa the classicist played number games with these choreographic groups of eight, six, four and two.) In Act I, when Princess Aurora's maids of honor are dancing center stage, the eight violin pages, on the sides of the stage, are doing gargouillades -- twinkling sideways jumps in which each foot writes a circle in the air. Still, there are lots of details that the company has yet to get right. Once Aurora drops the spindle after pricking her finger, why does nobody pick up it up? (Ms. Lane actually tripped over it.) Although Tatiana Ratmansky, who played the Queen and is the choreographer's wife and production colleague, had a great moment on June 8 when the realization that her daughter was dead hit her like a visible body blow, no interpreter has made that mother's anguish ring consistently true. All the dancers should be taught how to smile with their eyes more than with their mouths. But Ballet Theater, at last, has found itself a ""Sleeping Beauty"" in which the whole world onstage is engaging, lovely, touching.","A series of performances of a new production of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" offered a reminder that no ballet better showcases the way in which a company operates.",54a45255-e9ff-59ff-9ef3-323f5ddabde6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/16/arts/16BEAUTY/16BEAUTY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=32e630a9a04868c668391a0a17e4142ec36d2ed7de00ebe45aeab9dd3a229673&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Sleeping Beauty  Diana Vishneva of American Ballet Theater in a new production of this ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House.,54a45255-e9ff-59ff-9ef3-323f5ddabde6,N24News/imgs/54a45255-e9ff-59ff-9ef3-323f5ddabde6.jpg,6
Books,"Scrolling Through the Rise, and Takeover, of Instagram",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/14/books/review/no-filter-instagram-sarah-frier.html,"I was not excited to review a book about Instagram. Sure, I'm glued to the app; right now those pictures of dogs and babies and my friends' home-cooking are my main source of quiet pleasure in these miserable times. But it didn't feel like the moment for a list of reasons -- as so many books in this genre are -- of why this app was bad for me, and for the world. Written by the San Francisco-based Bloomberg reporter Sarah Frier, ""No Filter"" has a deceptively simple goal: ""to bring you the definitive inside story of Instagram,"" a photo-sharing app one billion of us use every single month. But in fact -- and happily -- this is a book about Silicon Valley. It is a record of a single app moving through the place. And in making that record, in hewing closely to Instagram and its founders, Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger, while giving new texture to the Valley's major players, like Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg, Frier tells the story of how that place works. Like many tech founders, Systrom hailed from a frat at Stanford, but he always saw himself as more artistic than the other ambitious engineers. Instead of dropping out of school to accept Zuckerberg's offer, in 2005, to join his start-up called TheFacebook.com, Systrom studied abroad in Florence. He'd always liked nice things (espresso done just right, fine clothes, old bourbon), but his photography professor made him give up his fancy camera for a simpler device, one that only shot blurry images in square frames. The experience taught him to embrace imperfection; that ""just because something is more technically complex doesn't mean it's better.""

Interning at the podcasting company Odeo, a 22-year-old Systrom sat next to a 29-year-old engineer, Jack Dorsey. Improbably, this N.Y.U. dropout ""with an anarchist tattoo and a nose ring"" befriended him. Odeo eventually gave rise to Twitter, an idea he'd dismissed (""They're crazy, Systrom thought. Nobody is going to use this thing"") just as he had Facebook. Frier at first blames Systrom's conservative temperament for his pretty bad judgment, but eventually concludes nobody else knew any better than he did. ""Silicon Valley looked like it was run by geniuses,"" she writes, but ""from the inside, it was clear that everyone was vulnerable, just like he was, just figuring it out as they went along."" After a stint writing marketing copy at Google (which he found so deeply boring he used the office espresso machines to make latte art), in 2009 he built Burbn, an app for people to find their friends and go out. After V.C. investors pushed Systrom to find a co-founder, he and Krieger -- a former Stanford classmate and a more skilled engineer -- soon turned their focus solely to photo sharing, a feature Burbn lacked. Most cellphone cameras were pretty crummy, so they would provide filters to make the pictures prettier. In 2010, that app became Instagram. The book manages to be cleareyed and objective about the founders and their many flaws, without sensationalizing or oversimplifying -- a hard balance to strike in tech coverage right now. Their backdrops are hilarious: Basically all of the corporate drama in the book happens around fire pits, at themed bars or twee espresso spots, in hot tubs and at Lake Tahoe. But mostly fire pits. If there is a villain in this tale, it is Zuckerberg. After Systrom sells Instagram to Facebook in 2012 for an (at the time) astonishing $1 billion, Zuckerberg comes off as controlling and cruel, maniacally focused on growth at the expense of all else. Systrom stayed on as Instagram's chief executive, but Frier outlines the ways in which their new owners began to undermine the founders, highlighting the clash in corporate cultures. Instagram has no reshare button by design (""all your posts were yours. That was what the founders wanted""); Zuckerberg wanted constant viral growth. But with this growth came the new worry that Instagram's success would ""cannibalize"" Facebook's, so Zuckerberg began to downplay Systrom's brand alongside Facebook's news feed. More upsetting, when Systrom tried to build protections against abusive comments, the ex-Facebook engineers on his team, reluctant to weed out opportunities for higher engagement, proposed controls that would be prohibitively hard to find and use. ""Thanks but no thanks"" was Systrom's response. These portions of the book read as a kind of sequel to the movie ""The Social Network,"" an update on the sort of man that young protagonist grew up to be.

Frier had a lot of access to the insider Valley gossip, like who got invited to Zuckerberg's parties (and that he served Systrom the boney mystery meat of an animal he had personally killed). She also had access to the Instagram founder himself, from whose perspective this book often seems to be told. The axes to grind are his axes. Every once in a while, in the heat of a dramatic moment, there are reminders of just how silly the stakes are. In an ""emergency meeting,"" Systrom announced that Instagram would be launching a new feature called ""stories,"" basically copying Snapchat. ""He explained that every user would get to add videos, which would disappear within 24 hours, to their personal reel,"" Frier writes. An executive later recalled: ""It was like being in the room when John F. Kennedy announces you're going to the moon."" This book is not about going to the moon, but we're not going there anyway, or anywhere else; we're on our couches, or in our beds, scrolling through Instagram. Now that that company -- and the pleasure it brings us -- are so deeply entrenched in the ever-growing behemoth that is Facebook, we need a book like this to explain what it is I'm tapping on all day. I spend hours staring at the screen, and now I have a better sense of who's staring back.","In ""No Filter,"" Sarah Frier goes behind the scenes of the billion-dollar deal between Kevin Systrom and Mark Zuckerberg.",e2844d0b-0b10-5574-bd42-713648c458af,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/31/obituaries/14Bowles/14Bowles-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=b2e01878d83e4a0d2f67a29c73dc7db84f39325b3fa1ced4d80d1991fb76aa55&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Instagram's cofounders, Kevin Systrom, right, and Mike Krieger.",e2844d0b-0b10-5574-bd42-713648c458af,N24News/imgs/e2844d0b-0b10-5574-bd42-713648c458af.jpg,13

Media,Mark Halperin Apologizes to Women He 'Mistreated',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/27/business/media/mark-halperin-apology-accusers.html,"In the statement, he also said that his workplace misconduct stopped after he left ABC.

""Those who have worked with me in the past decade know that my conduct in subsequent jobs at Time, Bloomberg, NBC News and Showtime has not been what it was at ABC,"" he wrote. ""I did not engage in improper behavior with colleagues or subordinates.""

CNN reported late Wednesday that five women had accused Mr. Halperin of sexual harassment in his time at ABC. Since then, additional women have accused him of unwanted sexual advances, including claims made in a new CNN article that published around the same time that Mr. Halperin posted his statement. The Daily Beast also published an article Friday evening naming a woman who accused Mr. Halperin of inappropriate behavior as recently as 2011.

By the end of Thursday, Mr. Halperin's media empire had begun to collapse.

MSNBC, where Mr. Halperin was a regular on ""Morning Joe,"" said it was parting ways with Mr. Halperin ""until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood."" HBO said it was dropping a planned television adaptation of his coming ""Game Change"" book because it ""has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions.""

Education,Battle Over Immigration Rattles Community Colleges,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/02/education/learning/immigration-community-colleges.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Pamela Ortiz Cerda vividly remembered the assignment six years ago from her Mexican-American history instructor at San Joaquin Delta College, a community college in Stockton, Calif. ""He required voting for our class,"" Ms. Ortiz Cerda said. Students were told to bring in voting ballot stubs as proof. ""I assumed it was a joke, but to the whole class he said, 'And for you, all you illegals, I'm going to have immigration waiting outside the class for you if you don't have the stubs,'"" she said. ""As a teenager, straight out of high school, that's terrifying."" Terrifying because Ms. Ortiz Cerda was undocumented herself, brought to the United States from Mexico when she was 9 by her parents, who sought a better life for the family.

Ms. Ortiz Cerda, now 24, became an advocate for those like herself, and she is the program services coordinator at Skyline College's Dream Center in San Bruno, Calif. It is one of about 40 such centers in California that assist students without legal status, navigating the complexities of admissions and classes, and connecting them with financial aid. ""It's really a focused effort in supporting undocumented students holistically through their higher ed journeys,"" she said. The centers are part of an endeavor in the nation's higher education system to help undocumented students attend classes and attain degrees. And while many of these programs have existed for years, there are concerns about pushback as the Trump administration has shifted to a ""zero tolerance"" policy on illegal immigration. This has led colleges to develop policies, with California in the forefront, that would thwart possible interference by the federal government.

The concerns are especially acute at community colleges, which have more open admissions policies than selective four-year institutions. According to a report from the California Community Colleges System, up to 70,000 undocumented students attend the state's 114 community colleges, more than 3 percent of the 2.1 million students enrolled. ""We have, as our primary mission, the embracing of all students, and it is our desire to be there for the most vulnerable and the most marginalized populations,"" said Judy C. Miner, chancellor of the Foothill-De Anza Community College District, which serves Silicon Valley. The official policy of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency is to steer clear of college campuses, unless there is an extraordinary safety threat. ""Enforcement actions are not to occur"" at schools, according to the agency's Sensitive Locations policy, ""to ensure that people seeking to participate in activities or utilize services provided at any sensitive location are free to do so, without fear or hesitation."" The same policy applies to churches and hospitals. But after Donald J. Trump was elected president, following a campaign filled with rhetoric against undocumented people, colleges became concerned about the future of the Sensitive Locations policy. The Department of Homeland Security issued a statement to colleges in November 2016 that said the policy would ""remain in effect."" However, in recent months, as scenes have unfolded of young immigrant children being separated from their parents and placed in detention centers, there are renewed doubts about how the current administration will treat undocumented college students. ""We don't feel a level of confidence and security on behalf of our students,"" said Dr. Miner, ""given the fact that we hear so many stories that would indicate that our own laws are not being honored.""

In a statement last month, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security said, ""Yes, the policy is still in place."" But Dr. Miner, as past chairman of the American Council on Education, which represents about 1,800 higher education institutions in the United States, said she and her colleagues had taken precautions. At her colleges and others, for example, any warrant from immigration officials must go directly to the college president for review and could be subject to a legal fight. All of this is a sea change from just a few years ago, when many undocumented students were given temporary immunity from deportation after the Obama administration's creation of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, in June 2012. An estimated 800,000 immigrants within a certain age range, who were brought to the United States as children, were allowed to remain as residents, attend school and obtain work permits.

The Trump administration effectively ended the program this year, and participants have been left in limbo as Congress considers an alternative, if any, and as challenges work their way through the courts. Even before DACA, California had its own Dream Act (Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors) in 2011, allowing those brought into the state without documentation as children to attend college and receive financial aid and in-state tuition benefits. At some community colleges, that means paying $46 per credit, instead of more than $200. And now state lawmakers are considering a new bill, AB-2477, that could create even more support centers for undocumented college students.

But in the current political climate, undocumented students in other states have faced resistance. In April, the Arizona Supreme Court eliminated in-state tuition benefits for them, and similar programs face legal hurdles in several other states, according to a recent analysis. ""There's so much enmity that it's looking very hopeless, honestly,"" said a mathematics student at Skyline College, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect his identity. ""People talk about the whitelash to Obama, to the first black president, and this was bound to happen."" The student's mother brought him to the United States from Mexico at age 13, when she was fleeing a violent husband. He worked at auto shops, warehouses and in manufacturing to support his mother and six siblings. Now, at 41, he has been able to get an associate degree and has ambitions for a bachelor's. He said he had often faced hostility as an undocumented person, but not at college. ""I don't feel fearful when I'm at school,"" he said. ""I don't feel my studying is threatened, at least not yet."" For Dr. Miner, the community college chancellor, the stakes are also personal. Her mother was undocumented, brought to the United States from Mexico at age 3 or 4 -- in another era, she also would have been a ""Dreamer."" ""Her own fear of discrimination led her to never speak Spanish to us, even though that was her first language, so we never grew up bilingual,"" Dr. Miner said. ""She was of that generation of immigrants who were so concerned about their children being real Americans.""","Many programs to support undocumented students have existed for years, but there are new concerns amid the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy.",dfc14a03-227f-539a-9510-a60e675981ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/05/education/learning/05DACAcc-5/05DACAcc-5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=13c20007f483d909fd4cddbbf5a02e62ebb2165b9ab0b3458ca8e0436bca57b9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Dream Center at Skyline College in San Bruno, Calif., is one of about 40 such centers in California that assist students without legal status.",dfc14a03-227f-539a-9510-a60e675981ab,N24News/imgs/dfc14a03-227f-539a-9510-a60e675981ab.jpg,22
Food,"A Brilliant Thanksgiving Strategy: Make Sides Quickly, or Ahead",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/15/dining/thanksgiving-sides.html,"At the Thanksgiving table, the turkey is sacred. The stuffing is imperative, the gravy essential and the mashed potatoes a lumpy rite of passage.

But when it comes to any other side dishes, the cook is free to play. As long as it tastes good, is made of vegetables and fits on the table, pretty much anything can find a place at the feast.

In my mind, the most important considerations for Thanksgiving side dishes are practical ones. Since the rest of the day is one long marathon of turkey minding, pie tending and relative wrangling, I like to make something way in advance, or right at the last minute as the turkey rests. In either case, simplicity is everything, and using big, assertive seasonings to highlight one easy-to-maneuver vegetable gets you most of the way there.

[See how our columnist approaches Thanksgiving, at Melissa Clark's Thanksgiving.]

Movies,'Cubby' Review: Offbeat? Definitely. Out of Touch? That Too.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/movies/cubby-review.html,"""Cubby"" is clearly an effort to make an offbeat, personal film; an opening title card says that it's ""based on a lie,"" and details throughout are so strange they must be drawn from life. But whatever charms the filmmakers envisioned are nowhere apparent in these 83 cringe-worthy minutes.

Mark Blane (who wrote the script and directed, although Ben Mankoff has an obscure ""co-directed"" credit) casts himself as Mark Nabel, a wide-eyed aspiring artist who arrives in New York from Indiana.

Real Estate,What I-95 Hasn't Put Asunder,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/realestate/saugatuck-conn-what-i-95-hasnt-put-asunder.html,"Drivers in general may be reduced to cursing -- silently or otherwise -- as they inch along Interstate 95 in parts of Connecticut during rush hour. But for many of the 2,500 or so residents of Saugatuck, a waterside slice of Westport 48 miles from Manhattan, the dislike is almost personal. When the interstate was built in the mid-1950s to ease longer-distance traffic off local streets, it didn't skirt the working-class Italian community the way it did more affluent parts of Fairfield County. It cut straight through, like a battering ram.

""You know that progress has to happen,"" said Cathy Romano, whose childhood home, a porch-wrapped wood-frame house on West Ferry Lane, became a dorm for highway builders before being razed for a parking lot. ""But it was traumatic.""

But the community, determined to hold Saugatuck together, adapted. Some of the displaced took their dwellings with them; a few ended up on Dr. Gillette Place Circle, so that Victorians are interspersed around an area with Capes and ranches. Ms. Romano relocated to a house on Saugatuck Avenue built by her grandfather, an Italian immigrant who worked as a gardener on nearby estates. Built in 1920 for $7,000, in an area that has since been zoned commercial, the shingle-sided colonial was a three-bedroom, though two other bedrooms have been added, said Ms. Romano, who is employed as the education director for the Church of the Assumption.

Even the nooks at the base of a column that holds up the highway across the Saugatuck River have been adapted for a handy purpose, as a spot for fishermen to store lobster pots, half a dozen to a stack.

Bustling and dense, with a number of restaurants and some shops, Saugatuck can feel almost urban, especially when compared with leafier, sleepier Westport areas like Coleytown, which has two-acre residential zoning. But there are plenty of people who would rather be squeezed in than spread out.",A waterfront slice of Westport bisected by I-95 is in the midst of a mixed-use redevelopment plan that attempts to ease the highway's effects.,6dca5ab9-4ca5-5b1c-80a4-7bd1f37217b9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/04/14/realestate/14LIVING_SPAN/14LIVING_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=400&w=600&s=c4a2560d216809e7d94de4189f027941c58e7cb35fe46b9fd1023f0ecad15600&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Jake Watkins enjoyed the beachfront with his daughter, Emma, in Saugatuck, Conn.",6dca5ab9-4ca5-5b1c-80a4-7bd1f37217b9,N24News/imgs/6dca5ab9-4ca5-5b1c-80a4-7bd1f37217b9.jpg,7
Movies,'Good Boys' Ends Hollywood's Comedy Drought,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/18/movies/good-boys-box-office-comedy.html,"LOS ANGELES -- Universal Pictures and a gaggle of foul-mouthed 12-year-olds proved over the weekend that, even in the Netflix epoch, comedies can still pack a box-office punch. ""Good Boys,"" about the R-rated misadventures of three preteen buddies, collected an estimated $21 million at theaters in the United States and Canada, according to Comscore. That No. 1 total -- the largest so far this year for an original comedy -- exceeded analysts' prerelease expectations by more than 30 percent. ""This is a franchise-level opening,"" David A. Gross, a movie consultant, wrote in a Saturday report that noted the movie's modest budget and strong scores from audiences and critics. ""Good Boys"" cost about $20 million to make.

Even rival studios breathed a sigh of relief. Moviegoers in North America have given a cold shoulder to one comedy after another in recent months: ""Stuber,"" ""Late Night,"" ""Long Shot,"" ""Booksmart,"" ""Poms,"" ""The Hustle,"" ""Shaft."" The carnage has prompted speculation that streaming services have made it easy for audiences looking for laughs to skip theaters.

The bar does seem to be higher. ""Good Boys"" was more than a well-crafted film backed by a very aggressive marketing campaign; it got noticed because it pushed taste boundaries. An R-rated movie about sixth-graders? One of the only other original comedies that has found an audience this year, ""Yesterday,"" released by Universal in June, used an over-the-top premise and Beatles music to up the ante.

Bruce Springsteen's songbook did not help ""Blinded by the Light"" (Warner Bros.), which went down in flames over the weekend. Despite mostly strong reviews, ""Blinded by the Light"" took in about $4.5 million, for a ninth-place start. It probably struck ticket buyers as too similar to ""Yesterday,"" box-office analysts said. Warner paid about $15 million to acquire rights to the film, which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in January.

Two other new movies also fizzled. ""Where'd You Go, Bernadette"" (United Artists) collected $3.5 million, while ""47 Meters Down: Uncaged"" (Entertainment Studios) took in roughly $9 million, about 20 percent less than its series predecessor managed during its first weekend in 2017. Faring somewhat better was ""The Angry Birds Movie 2"" (Sony), which sold $10.5 million in tickets, for a domestic total of $16.2 million since arriving on Tuesday. The first ""Angry Birds"" collected $45.7 million over its first six days in 2016. Sony noted that the sequel received starkly better reviews than the initial movie and that another major animated film does not arrive until late September. Sony had another good weekend with Quentin Tarantino's ""Once Upon a Time ... In Hollywood,"" which collected $53.7 million in its initial rollout overseas. Ticket sales were particularly strong in Britain and Australia. ""Once Upon a Time"" took in $7.6 million in North America from Friday to Sunday, for a four-week domestic total of $114.3 million.","The R-rated movie about foul-mouthed 12-year-olds was No. 1 with about $21 million, the year's largest opening total for an original comedy.",a5b17022-0843-53e7-b219-bdb3e5eea302,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/08/18/arts/18box-1/18box-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=32cb56d218c0651c8d1c85ced11425f3ec90b2b5b3b02ef9c9d2fde03580bda6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Keith L.

Automobiles,"In Florida, New Stars on Block",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/16/automobiles/in-florida-new-stars-on-block.html,"AMELIA ISLAND, FLA. -- The 19th annual Amelia Island Concours d'Elegance went off largely according to script last weekend, with antique and collectible vehicles, high-powered racing machines and famous personalities feted over three idyllic days in the Florida sunshine.

It was hardly a surprise, for instance, that a one-of-a-kind 1937 Horch 853 was honored as the most elegant entry in the concours, and that a 1958 Scarab racecar earned accolades among the performance machines. And at the two auctions held in conjunction with the concours, a new record -- $66.8 million in sales -- was recorded, in line with the recent escalation of values for high-end collector cars.

But if there was a big surprise -- one unexpected breakout star of the weekend -- it had to be the sexy sports car that at one time nearly put BMW out of business.

At the Gooding & Company auction, the lone BMW 507 consigned, a white 1958 Series II, sold for a surprising $1.8 million -- an auction-sale record for the model. Hardly had that shock worn off when, the next day, RM Auctions sold a 1958 507 Series II, the color of pencil lead, for a staggering $2.4 million.","The breakout star at auctions associated with the 19th annual Amelia Island Concours d'Élégance was the 1958 BMW 507, as two models broke records at separate events.",d26800d1-ff4f-52c7-82c0-e2ea36b7df41,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/03/16/automobiles/AMELIA1/AMELIA1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=344&w=600&s=aaacf99b459e3249e14b55f94745215a1436f27b5b2c31c6d3a3c023ed6c3bab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,This 1958 BMW 507 sold for $2.4 million at Amelia Island.,d26800d1-ff4f-52c7-82c0-e2ea36b7df41,N24News/imgs/d26800d1-ff4f-52c7-82c0-e2ea36b7df41.jpg,23

Ms. Petrin appeared just as calmly immersed in her task of adorning the ground with origami squares. Three live snakes, delivered from offstage, soon joined in. Humans and reptiles slid over and around one another.

This was just the first of many tenuously related, increasingly chaotic episodes, including the arrival of two Chihuahuas (the snakes, not to worry, had exited) and a migration into the adjacent black-box theater for a ritualistic ringing of hand-held bells. A mysterious voice, accompanying a video projection, pronounced, ""This piece will not save us."" Ms. Lacey, cradling a small, three-legged dog while bending and stretching her limbs, told a story about an artist and an institution (Realness, perhaps) trying to spice up their relationship like old lovers. What to do with all this information? I thought of dance as undomesticated wildlife, of the predators and prey involved in buying and selling performance.

Down one set of stairs and up another, in a tucked-away dance studio not often used for performances, the choreographer Heather Kravas, visiting from Seattle, offered the New York premiere of ""dead, disappears."" Ms. Kravas was her own predator and protector in this stark, self-punishing solo, as she put herself through perilous paces inspired by the sculptor Richard Serra's ""Verb List,"" a series of actions that he associated with making his pieces.

What seemed at first like arbitrary acts of masochism -- walking on tiptoe with a trash bag over her head while barking two-syllable phrases -- deepened into a formidable exploration of language, the female body and the power play between them. Having duct-taped a pillow to a chair, as if it were a prisoner, Ms. Kravas pounded it with a long pole, shouting a list of alphabetized verbs, one per swipe.

Food,The Oregon Trail,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/14/dining/oregon-wine.html,"Credit...Amanda Lucier for The New York Times



GASTON, Ore. -- In the kitchen at the headquarters of Big Table Farm, the home of the proprietors Brian Marcy and Clare Carver, a few words to live by are written on a blackboard hanging a bit lopsidedly on a wall: ""Do a little bit every day towards your dream."" The husband-and-wife team have operated their winery in just this fashion since acquiring 70 acres off a dirt road here in the hills of the northern Willamette Valley a decade ago. They have stitched together a do-it-yourself operation: Mr. Marcy, the winemaker, buys grapes from a network of 12 vineyards, all within an hour of the farm, and tends the vegetable crops, and Ms. Carver, an accomplished artist, looks after the business, including drawing labels, wrapping bottles in paper by hand, marketing, entertaining visitors and raising animals. The Big Table menagerie includes 16 Irish Dexter cattle that are raised for beef, two American Guinea hogs, a couple of horses, six beehives, chickens, assorted dogs and cats, and an old goat who roves the place as a sort of mascot.

""There's a sense of continuity and grounding that comes with being connected to the place,"" Ms. Carver said. You can sense that in the wines, too, largely pinot noirs and chardonnays that are both charming and delicious, if not always perfectly refined. Their barnlike winery, which they designed and built themselves, was financed partly by crowdfunding. One hundred people gave $1,700 each, for which they received wine and a plaque in the winery. The last and most costly piece, clearing and planting their own vineyard, remains a dream. But they have identified approximately 5 to 15 likely acres on the farm.

Big Table is one of many energetic, heartfelt operations that make Oregon such a fascinating place. I'm not one to make grand pronouncements about wine. The subject is too complex -- and the stakes, frankly, too low -- to warrant the sort of bold simplifications that seem to win at politics but lose at any deeper understanding of even this small part of the world. But after spending 10 days here in late July, visiting winemakers, tasting an awful lot of bottles and, incidentally, speaking at the International Pinot Noir Celebration, I can't help but conclude that Oregon is right now the single most exciting winemaking area in the United States.

That is not to say that great things are not happening in the rest of the country. I am fascinated by what producers are achieving all over California; in Walla Walla, Wash.; and in the Finger Lakes region of New York. Great wines are being made in Michigan, in Vermont, in Texas and beyond. Amanda Lucier for The New York Times Collectively speaking, nowhere else does the level of quality seem so high, the perspectives so diverse or the experimentation so fierce as it is in Oregon right now. Here in the Willamette Valley, pinot noir is the dominant story, and it is hard to argue with its success. Pioneers like The Eyrie Vineyards, arguably the first to succeed with pinot noir in the 1970s, and Domaine Drouhin Oregon, whose founding in 1987 by the renowned Burgundy house Joseph Drouhin gave international credibility to the region, have grown and evolved, humming along on success after success. They were joined by a wave of producers in the 1990s, like Cristom Vineyards, Brick House Vineyards and Soter Vineyards.

Yet pinot noir is not the sole narrative of the Willamette Valley. After a few false starts with chardonnay, the quality in the last decade has gotten better and better, especially in wines with a lean, minerally, energetic style. Burgundians have flocked to Oregon in the wake of Drouhin's success. Dominique Lafon of Domaine des Comtes Lafon in Meursault is working with Larry Stone, a pioneering American sommelier who planted 66 acres in 2013 in the Eola-Amity Hills region. Their operation, Lingua Franca, now sells elegant pinot noirs and chardonnays from purchased grapes and, this year, an excellent rose from the vineyard's first crop.

There's also Alexandrine Roy of Domaine Marc Roy of Gevrey-Chambertin, working with Phelps Creek Vineyards in the Columbia Gorge area; and Jean-Nicolas Meo of Meo-Camuzet in Vosnes-Romanee, who bought land in the Willamette with Jay Boberg, a music entrepreneur. The first vintage of Nicolas-Jay was 2014. Jacques Lardiere, the longtime technical director at Louis Jadot, the Burgundy house, is now overseeing Jadot's new Resonance operation, and Louis-Michel Liger-Belair of Comte Liger-Belair is the consulting winemaker for Chapter 24 Vineyards. Oregon has established itself so well that a thriving wine counterculture has arisen, which, if not exactly rebelling against the dominance of pinot noir, is seeking to offer alternatives that are delicious and cheaper.

During my visit, I tried dolcettos and nebbiolos, assyrtikos and aligotes, gewurztraminers and others from labels like Holden Wine Company, Franchere Wine Company, Smockshop Band and Hiyu Wine Farm. Many were terrific. Seek them out if you are in the mood to sample some surprising, provocative wines. Part of what I love about Oregon, and the Willamette Valley in particular, is the small scale. Most Willamette wineries are family operations, and the business of the valley is clearly agriculture, not tourism. It has yet to see the large-scale hotels, fancy restaurants and extravagant winery structures that make, say, Napa Valley seem more Disney than farmland. Big wine companies like Jackson Family Wines and Ste. Michelle Wine Estates have started to buy in. This is not a bad thing, but it does bring with it the possibility, at least, that big companies will want to push tourism, and that land values will rise quickly. In which case, dreams like Big Table Farm's may no longer be possible, even a little bit at a time. Follow NYT Food on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and Pinterest.

His wife, Jeri Goodkind, confirmed the death but did not specify a cause.

Mr. Goodkind was a latecomer to writing: He spent years as a woodworker and wildlife artist before publishing his first novel, ""Wizard's First Rule,"" when he was 45. But that book -- the story of a heroic forest guide, Richard, who teams with a beautiful woman, Kahlan, to defeat an evil wizard, Darken Rahl -- won legions of fans and earned positive reviews when it was published by Tor Books in 1994.

Kirkus Reviews called the novel, which became the first book in the ""Sword of Truth"" series, ""a wonderfully creative, seamless and stirring epic fantasy debut.""

Over the next 24 years, Mr. Goodkind's series grew to include 17 books, several of them best sellers. Together, the ""Sword of Truth"" books have sold more than 25 million copies worldwide. In 2008, the books were adapted by the director and producer Sam Raimi into a television series, ""Legend of the Seeker,"" that aired for two seasons on ABC.","His epic series ""The Sword of Truth"" spanned 17 books and sold more than 25 million copies worldwide.

Real Estate,More Space in Brooklyn's Clinton Hill,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/realestate/clinton-hill-brooklyn-duplex-for-more-space.html,"For nearly six years, Josue Asselin-Bienvenue and Michael Robinson II shared a tiny studio on the fourth floor of a walk-up building on far East 14th Street. Their rental, in a co-op building, cost $1,200 a month, allowing them to save for a down payment. When the formerly rent-stabilized one-bedroom upstairs became available three years ago, they considered buying it. At less than 600 square feet, the place was listed for around $350,000 with monthly maintenance in the mid $600s. ""The apartment had not been renovated for about 60 years,"" Mr. Asselin-Bienvenue said. ""They still had the bathroom in the hallway, not even attached to the apartment."" The couple decided they would prefer to pay more for a finished place. They started the hunt for a bigger apartment with the help of Justin Croushore, a salesman at Compass, who had been Mr. Asselin-Bienvenue's roommate at the Fashion Institute of Technology.

""They could grow out of that space very quickly,"" he said. ""People didn't really come to visit them because it was so far east on 14th Street."" The men, who are both in their 30s, had a price range of $500,000 to $700,000. Mr. Asselin-Bienvenue, who is from Quebec, works in TriBeCa as a women's clothing designer, while Mr. Robinson, a graduate of the Rochester Institute of Technology, is an industrial designer in Midtown, working on packaging. On the familiar turf of Lower Manhattan, they deemed every place they saw too small or too dark. Mr. Asselin-Bienvenue enjoyed the search for an apartment. ""How bad is it to walk around the city and look at apartments?"" he said.

Mr. Robinson was less enthusiastic. ""On any hunt, I think there's the hunter and then there's the sherpa, and I felt I played a supporting role in a lot of ways,"" he said. During Hurricane Sandy in late 2012, their building's basement flooded. Power was out for more than a week. So they stayed at a friend's one-bedroom on a quiet, leafy brownstone block in Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. ""It is less stressful coming home, fancy that,"" Mr. Robinson said. They decided to look for a place in Brooklyn.

In Fort Greene, they visited a two-bedroom with skylights and a roof deck in a small co-op building in a row of brownstones. The price was $550,000, with maintenance of almost $800 a month. The building had a history of flooding. Their lawyer suggested they pay another visit after a downpour. They did, and found signs of water damage. Was this new or had they not noticed? They were unable to get an answer. The couple were also nervous about buying into a small building where so few units shared expenses. In Williamsburg, they liked a sunny two-bedroom in a 24-unit condominium on Havemeyer Street. The price was $599,000, with monthly charges of just over $300. The open house was packed. ""It was a bit underpriced, which was well done by the agent,"" Mr. Asselin-Bienvenue said. ""They probably ended up getting more than if they started with a higher price.""

Approximately 30 offers were received, Mr. Croushore said. The place sold for $693,000. ""The market was just so hot,"" he said. ""You go to stuff like that too much, and as a buyer you get overwhelmed."" Meanwhile, the Boerum Hill friend was moving, so the couple left their walk-up, assumed the lease for around $2,000 a month and took a break from searching. ""I used to drag Michael to open houses everywhere,"" Mr. Asselin-Bienvenue recalled, ""and Michael said: 'We have to have a rule. After two places you have to take me somewhere to eat, and after three places you have to find me something to drink.' ""

When they resumed the hunt last fall, they went to see a new condominium building in Bedford-Stuyvesant. All four units, with two or three bedrooms, were available, most in the $800,000s with monthly charges of around $700.

Travel,"Simple, Affordable and Socially Distanced, Snowshoeing Gets Hot",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/travel/snowshoeing-coronavirus.html,"When the pandemic struck in the height of the 2020 ski season, closing the downhill ski mountain in Breckenridge, Colo., the Breckenridge Nordic & Snowshoe Adventure Center found families turning to its snow sports, which were, by their natures, socially distanced, pandemic or not. ""Parents were home-schooling their children who didn't have P.E. or sports teams or clubs or rec centers,"" said Therese Dayton, the program manager for the recreational area, home to a retail shop, rental gear and more than 12 miles of snowshoe trails in the White River National Forest. ""We were wiped out of any children's equipment by May."" Where downhill skiing takes training and cross-country skiing often demands stamina, snowshoeing doesn't require a class or even a demonstration to master -- if you can walk, say its fans, you can snowshoe -- making snowshoeing an easy-access snow sport for recreationalists who don't want to give up on the outdoors this winter. ""We saw a huge spike in outdoor activity"" last spring, said Nick Sargent, the president of Snowsports Industries America, a nonprofit trade association. ""It wasn't just backcountry or uphill skiing. It was snowshoeing, Nordic skiing, fat-tire biking, winter running, sledding, all those sports and activities that you can do without a resort chairlift, things you can do from home and in the backyard.""

Like bikes in the spring, which surged in sales -- up nearly two-thirds over the year before, according to the retail analysts NPD Group -- snowshoes are poised to be the hot seller in the pandemic's first full winter. From August through October, snowshoe sales grew more than 250 percent compared to the same period the year before, outpacing gains of all backcountry equipment sales, which are uniformly up, according to NPD. But at the outdoor retailer REI Co-op, sales of snowshoes are up fourfold compared to last year (its cross-country ski sales, which have tripled, aren't far behind). Adult snowshoes at REI run from about $160 to $300. Children's snowshoes start around $40. Ben Johns, REI's general merchandising manager for action sports, tied the sales to a rise of interest in ""non-lift-assisted"" activities, including backcountry skiing, outside of resorts. ""There's more social distancing and less expense and you can go spontaneously,"" Mr. Johns said. According to Snow Sports Insights, a market research firm, snowshoe participation grew more than 12 percent last season, to 3.6 million participants.

Among winter activities, snowshoeing tends to be accessible both in terms of expense and skill, especially for those who live in snowy climates. ""Most winter sports are expensive,"" Mr. Madigan said. ""Snowshoeing, on the other hand, is easily attainable. That has to be a feeder to the growth of the category."" Snowshoes attach to your winter boots, so there is no dedicated footwear required. Poles are optional, but will help you keep your balance, especially on sloping terrain; REI has poles from about $45 a pair. (If you have trekking poles, make sure to add ""snow baskets"" -- about $8 a pair at REI -- to the tips to keep them from sinking too far down in the snow). Rather than commuting to a resort and paying for access, you can snowshoe almost anywhere, including urban parks. ""It's very affordable as long as you're not having to drive great distances to get to snow,"" said Mark Elmore, the sports director for the United States Snowshoe Association, which organizes snowshoe championship races, who has owned, auctioned or donated roughly 500 pairs of snowshoes since 1987. The wide frames of snowshoes disperse your weight and hold you aloft closer to the surface while small teeth on the bottom of the shoes grip the snow, allowing you to walk more naturally, rather than sinking deeply with every step.

The most important part of snowshoeing isn't the shoes, say experts; it's how you dress. Start with a moisture-wicking base layer, add a mid-layer or more if you like and cover it all with a water-resistant outer layer. Be prepared to shed a layer or your hat along the way, as snowshoeing requires more exertion than walking. And carry water; the dry winter air can leave you more dehydrated than in other seasons. Provided you don't wander into the backcountry without avalanche training, snowshoeing is relatively safe. ""There's low risk for danger or injury,"" Mr. Sargent, of Snowsports Industries America, said. ""The biggest danger is venturing into the outdoors and getting lost, but you have yourself to follow and backtrack."" Because it doesn't require special skills, snowshoeing suits all ages, say experts. It's important to ensure children are dressed warmly and remain hydrated, according to Emily Stone, the naturalist and education director at Cable Natural History Museum in Cable, Wis., who, before the pandemic, often led snowshoeing field trips for third graders. ""It feels kind of funny on their feet at first, but they have a ton of fun especially if the snow is super deep,"" she said. ""One of the biggest challenges with kids is getting them to stay upright because they love to flop in the snow.""

Snowshoeing is also an explorer's sport, as bushwhacking is easier when the leaves are down and pests like deer ticks aren't a threat. Winter also reveals signs of abundant wildlife, which can be more obscure in other seasons. ""We call it 'see-through season,'"" Ms. Stone said. ""It's incredible how the world comes alive. You think winters are dead, but there's a lot that's active in the winter."" Families who may have spent a lot of time in and around their homes may appreciate how snow visually transforms the neighborhood. ""A place you might be very familiar with takes on a whole different character in snow season,"" Mr. Elmore, of the U.S. Snowshoe Association, said. While snowshoeing is accessible at the entry level, advanced athletes have an entire cosmos of models designed for everything from backcountry trail-breaking to running. Snowshoes have come a long way from the heavy wood-and-rawhide vintage pairs often hanging on ski lodge walls (though wooden snowshoes are still highly prized). Aluminum snowshoes are lighter and have been adapted to all kinds of conditions and activities, including racing, which requires core strength as well as flexibility to handle the conditions. ""It's easier on the body because you're running on a soft surface and the shock and impact are less, but it takes great exertion because it's a soft surface,"" Mr. Elmore said.","As biking was to spring, snowshoeing is to winter as exercisers adapt to cold weather.",fadb2316-ded8-5f0e-aab1-e661a286985e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/03/travel/00Snowshoeing-1/oakImage-1608145493953-facebookJumbo.jpg,"Snowshoeing is poised to become one of this winter's most popular outdoor pastimes, as people look for activities that offer plenty of social distance.",fadb2316-ded8-5f0e-aab1-e661a286985e,N24News/imgs/fadb2316-ded8-5f0e-aab1-e661a286985e.jpg,4
Art & Design,T.S. Eliot's Estate Donates 'Cats' Royalties to Brontë Museum,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/08/arts/design/ts-eliot-cats-royalties-bronte-museum.html,"Thanks in part to a donation from the estate of one of England's most esteemed poets -- and some dancing cats -- the Bronte Parsonage Museum's doors will remain open, for now.

The estate of T.S. Eliot has gifted the struggling museum, which reopened in late August after being closed since March, 20,000 pounds (or approximately $26,000) last week. The donation was first reported by the BBC.

The parsonage, located in Haworth, said it was facing a loss of expected income of more than PS500,000 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

There is a connection between Eliot and the Brontes: The ""Bradford millionaire"" who appears in the Eliot poem ""The Waste Land"" is thought to be Sir James Roberts, a Yorkshire philanthropist who was also a customer at the bank where Eliot worked. Mr. Roberts donated Haworth Parsonage -- once the home of the Bronte sisters, Charlotte, Emily and Anne -- to the Bronte Society, which operates the museum, in 1928. Roberts knew the family as a child.","A gift of 20,000 pounds will help sustain the Brontë Parsonage Museum, which is facing mounting losses because of the coronavirus.",574d6400-80d7-54bc-9715-cf50261e1f8e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/09/arts/08bronte-item-2/08bronte-item-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=9d1b55eca8c162c07ac97de644d738298073bbc7eeee8427325c5bd323f69d48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A scene from ""Cats"" on Broadway, in 1997.

Economy,"Lotto Tickets Are Nice, Boss, but Can I Have My Bonus?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/11/business/economy/games-employers.html,"It seemed like an epic blunder: United Airlines announced that it was replacing a standard bonus with a lottery that would give nothing to most of its roughly 90,000 workers while awarding lavish prizes, like $100,000 in cash and Mercedes-Benz sedans, to a few lucky winners. United had hoped the sweepstakes approach would ""build excitement and a sense of accomplishment."" But after workers deluged the company with hostile comments, the airline said last week that it was ""pressing the pause button on these changes."" The fiasco pulled back the curtain on the widespread use of gamelike techniques for motivating employees. While employers have relied on such practices for decades, the methods have become increasingly sophisticated in an age when companies can collect more data about employee behavior than ever before, and as video game technology has proliferated.

Recent studies show a rapidly growing market for so-called gamification software, some of which allows workers to earn points and badges by completing certain tasks or performing well. Defenders say such practices can be useful -- if they are designed to make employees feel more engaged and invested in their work, not to save money. But to skeptics, the United program illustrated a deeper problem with gamelike motivational methods. ""Shareholders and management get the monetary rewards, and 'meaning' and 'excitement' are consolation prizes that go to workers,"" said Caitlin Petre, an assistant professor of media studies at Rutgers University who has examined similar practices at media companies. ""This is very much in line with my understanding of how the gamification trend in workplaces operates."" Whatever one thinks about the ethics of workplace games, few question their potential to influence workers in certain circumstances. A pile of psychological research has shown that they can be cheaper and more effective at motivating workers than straight cash. An experiment published in 2012 in the American Journal of Health Promotion showed that a far higher proportion of employees completed a health-risk assessment when they got a modest chance to win up to $125 in a lottery than when they would receive a $25 gift certificate.

""Lotteries in general may be more effective than fixed payments, as people tend to overweigh small probabilities in making decisions,"" the paper noted. Other studies have shown that simple compliments and recognition, which gamification software frequently incorporates, may be more effective than cash in motivating workers. An experiment at a semiconductor plant, published in 2014, showed that workers' productivity rose more if they were rewarded with a note thanking them for their ""hard work and great achievements in yesterday's shift"" than if they were given a cash bonus worth about $25. In principle, there is no moral problem with seeking cheaper ways to motivate workers. Compensation and motivation are two distinct concepts, and a company could decide to pay its workers fairly -- or exceedingly generously -- then deploy lotteries and praise to motivate them to perform better. ""There are two things to consider,"" said Kristen Berman of the behavioral consulting nonprofit Irrational Labs. ""One is pay -- what do people get paid, what should they get paid, what do they expect to get paid. The second is motivating people to do things we want them to do in the workplace."" That distinction is often easiest to enforce when the tasks that employers link to gamelike rewards are narrow, and not central to a worker's job description.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Charlotte Blank, the chief behavioral officer of Maritz, which designs employee motivation and incentive programs, said lotteries could be an effective way to pique interest among salespeople in a new product but should not replace crucial components of pay.

""Why wouldn't they?"" said Karen Levy, an assistant professor in the department of information science at Cornell University, who has studied gamelike incentives. ""It's the structure of the corporation"" to want to minimize labor costs. Perhaps most prominent, so-called gig economy companies like Uber have frequently used gamelike incentives as a cheaper alternative to traditional bonuses. Uber's operations managers have sometimes cut back on straight cash bonuses and hourly guarantees in favor of raffles and other contests, for which the prize could be a few hundred dollars or tickets to a sporting event. The goal was to get drivers onto the road during high-demand periods at a lower cost. More traditional companies have relied on similar tactics. For example, T-Mobile sometimes puts in place short-term gamelike incentives on top of its standard bonus program. In its Wichita, Kan., call center this month, agents who hit certain performance targets receive a scratch-off ticket with a dollar value attached to it, redeemable for a variety of prizes. The company has previously rewarded agents for certain achievements with time inside a ""money machine"" that blows around certificates redeemable for prizes, which they try to grab. ""It sure saves them money to do this instead of pay increases,"" said Justin Smith, a T-Mobile customer service agent. Mr. Smith said that the company's wage increases for his job category had barely kept up with inflation and that T-Mobile effectively reduced compensation for high performers in his department last year when it changed its standard bonus from a flat monthly payment to one tied to the number of hours they work.

""They tried to make it seem like this is the best way to do it,"" Mr. Smith said. But, he said, ""Even if you worked every hour scheduled, it would still be 15 to 20 percent less than the old system."" A T-Mobile spokeswoman said: ""We offer market-competitive base pay, one-of-a-kind stock grants and bonuses. On top of that, our leaders periodically recognize performance in other ways that best resonate with their teams."" Often companies don't actually lower compensation but push workers to do more for the same pay by using games and gamelike incentives. To motivate thousands of employees to flag translation errors in foreign-language editions of Windows, Microsoft once set up a game that allowed the employees to advance to different levels by reviewing screenshots, then displayed each worker's level on a leader board. ""Not only did they do it above and beyond their work responsibilities,"" wrote Kevin Werbach, a University of Pennsylvania business professor, and Dan Hunter, then a professor at New York Law School, in a book on gamification, ""but a large number of them described the process as enjoyable and even addicting."" Other employers, including the Walt Disney Company and Gawker, have used scoreboards and leader boards to drive up productivity by giving workers constantly updated performance information that compares them with one another. ""In effect, that is lowering compensation,"" Ms. Petre said. ""It has the effect of driving more and more output as people's competitive instincts kick in."" In the end, what may have set United apart was not that it tried to replace a portion of traditional compensation with ""excitement"" but the company's openness about the trade-off.

In the gig economy, said Alex Rosenblat, a researcher at the Data & Society Research Institute who is the author of the forthcoming book, ""Uberland,"" non-monetary rewards that rein in labor costs, or incentives aimed at individual drivers, can work because drivers rarely have enough information to piece together the larger picture -- sometimes even their own bottom line. ""But in the United case,"" Ms. Rosenblat said, ""everyone knows what they're earning.""","Gamelike methods can effectively motivate workers, in the right circumstances.

Opinion,Trump Needed the 'Boneheads' More Than He Knew,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/07/opinion/trump-populists-technocrats.html,"Donald Trump's public feuding with his own senior appointees is a signature aspect of his tumultuous presidency. The Fed chairman, Jerome Powell, and his colleagues are ""boneheads""; a former national security adviser (John Bolton) is a ""wacko""; and his former secretary of state (Rex Tillerson) is ""dumb as a rock."" Beyond the idiosyncratic personal dramas of the Trump administration, these public insults point to an important issue surrounding the ideological battles over populism. Although populism casts itself in opposition to technocratic expertise, like any modern political movement it ultimately relies upon it. This is especially true in the present political environment. In theory, populists should favor democratic processes that allow for wide-ranging citizen input in policy formation; technocrats, by contrast, rely on a narrow group of ""experts"" to shape policy. But events of recent years have challenged these assumptions: The executive bureaucracy has proved a more reliable instrument for translating populist causes into policy than nominally democratic institutions like Congress. For populist policy reforms to succeed, populists -- especially those on the right -- need to drop their naive and self-defeating pretensions of ""dismantling the administrative state."" Populism should not be conceived as a rejection of all technocratic expertise but rather as a competing vision of how to use it, a concept that some scholars have termed ""technopopulism.""

In this regard, populists have a lot to learn from the failures of the Trump administration. Despite his extremely aggressive use of the presidency's bully pulpit, Mr. Trump had little success in marshaling popular or legislative majorities to drive major changes in policy. Whatever incremental progress the administration made on the distinctive, populist elements of Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign -- like revising trade policies with China, promoting advanced manufacturing or beginning to rein in tech monopolies -- was almost entirely achieved through executive orders or technocratic agencies like the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. By contrast, Mr. Trump's biggest legislative achievement was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, largely an ""establishment Republican"" creation that primarily benefited the ultrawealthy. Notably, the more populist aspects of the tax law -- like limitations on state and local tax deductions, limitations on corporate debt interest deductibility and new taxes on enormous university endowments -- owe more to Treasury bureaucrats and ""D.C. insiders"" than to grass-roots organizing or mass media appeals. Indeed, with the exception of the First Step Act (criminal-justice reform), Congress proved remarkably unresponsive to popular opinion during the last four years. The tax law was the second-least popular piece of legislation of the last quarter century. The least popular also came in Mr. Trump's term, in 2017: the attempted repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But Mr. Trump's Department of Health and Human Services and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services -- one of the more opaque parts of the executive bureaucracy -- recently finalized a rule-making process to control the costs of some prescription drugs based on the prices negotiated by foreign governments, an initiative that has polled well for years. Today, it seems that the more attention a populist (or any other) policy proposal receives, the less likely it is to be implemented. Fewer than 20 miles of new, primary construction were completed on Mr. Trump's notorious border wall, while immigration legislation like the Raise Act went nowhere. High-profile left-populist proposals like ""Medicare for all"" also seem to have stalled out.

The popularity of such proposals waxes and wanes. Very often, they are subject to the logic of polarization -- embrace by one side means the other side will do everything to thwart it. But whatever the reasons, this trend contradicts conventional understandings of American democracy. Mass campaigns and institutions increasingly function as arenas where popular enthusiasms burn themselves out, not as avenues for ordinary people to influence policy. This mismatch between popular institutions and populist policy achievements is not accidental but reflects an underlying reality of America's increasingly oligarchic politics. Influencing public opinion and organizing mass campaigns are now very expensive propositions; they largely rely on billionaire donors and large corporations or foundations that typically have little interest in structural changes to the status quo. At the same time, social media and other popular media are largely controlled by, or at least consumed through, a handful of Big Tech platforms. For these and other reasons, technocratic bureaucracies -- although they can certainly be captured -- actually retain greater capacity for autonomous policymaking in the public interest than theoretically democratic institutions like legislatures. In this environment, the prospects for populist policy reforms will depend less on legislation or so-called grass-roots organizing than on the personnel and actions of technocratic executive agencies. Rather than pursue the hopeless and counterproductive task of eliminating these agencies, populists should focus on trying to positively influence them. Elections are one way to do that, of course, but hardly the only one. And in the case of the Trump administration, at least, staffing decisions only occasionally matched campaign messaging. The weakness and unresponsiveness of nominally democratic institutions is likely to be a source of political instability for the foreseeable future. Given the low confidence in these institutions, however, the competent use of the state apparatus to address real problems --what is sometimes called ""performance legitimacy"" -- will be more important to the success of any political movement than merely winning elections. Mr. Trump's surprise 2016 election victory did reorient popular and even elite discourse in ways that should not be minimized. An emphasis on revitalizing American manufacturing and industrial policy -- as in President-elect Joe Biden's ""Made in America"" plan -- is now a hallmark of ambitious proposals on the right and left. But victorious election campaigns do not automatically translate into fundamental changes in policy. For this very reason, supporters as well as critics of populism must recognize that its fate will not be determined simply by whether purportedly populist candidates win or lose elections. Ultimately, populism's success rests not on the stridency of its opposition to the technocratic elite but on the degree of its incorporation into it.

Sports,"Harry Glickman, Who Brought Basketball to Oregon, Dies at 96",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/13/sports/basketball/harry-glickman-dead.html,"Harry Glickman, the founder of the Portland Trail Blazers, at a news conference in April 1971, after the end of the team's first season. Six years later, the Trail Blazers would win the N.B.A. championship.





Harry Glickman, who founded the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association and was widely considered the father of professional sports in Oregon, died on Wednesday in Portland. He was 96. His death, at an assisted living center, was confirmed by his son, Marshall. Mr. Glickman held many titles for the Trail Blazers: executive vice president from 1970 to 1987, general manager from 1976 to 1981, president from 1987 to 1994. He was also a tireless promoter and a civic-minded entrepreneur in an era that predated the rise of billion-dollar sports franchises. ""He was just one of those pure guys who loves the state and the city he came from,"" Chris McGowan, the Trail Blazers' president, said in a phone interview, ""and he did everything he could to enrich it."" Mr. Glickman helped shape the Trail Blazers into one of the N.B.A.'s great success stories. Like most expansion teams, they got off to a slow start. But, led by Bill Walton at center, they won a championship in their seventh season, and they frequently made the playoffs and consistently drew capacity crowds for many years.

Mr. Glickman had long since retired from his front-office position when Mr. McGowan took charge of the team in 2012, but he still valued the organization and the city he called home. He sought out Mr. McGowan, who was relocating from Los Angeles, after his introductory news conference and extended an invitation: How about they take a tour of Portland the next day? ""He came and got me, and we literally spent three hours driving around Portland,"" Mr. McGowan recalled. ""He showed me all the landmarks, where the Blazers had their championship parade, the basketball courts where Bill Walton spent time. I'll never forget it."" Harry Glickman was born in Portland on May 13, 1924, and raised there by his mother, Bessie, who worked in the garment industry, after she and his father, Sam, divorced. He enrolled at the University of Oregon to study journalism, but left to spend three years with the Seventh Army's 12th Armored Division during World War II. He was elevated to the rank of staff sergeant while serving in Europe, and was awarded a Bronze Star. After returning home, Mr. Glickman completed his degree and hoped to write about sports for one of Portland's two daily newspapers. But, unable to land a job right away, he gravitated to the business of promoting sports. He staged boxing events and lured the Harlem Globetrotters and the National Football League to Portland for exhibitions.

Mr. Glickman was the president of a company called Oregon Sports Attractions and, in 1960, founded a minor-league hockey team, the Portland Buckaroos, which went on to win three league championships in front of adoring crowds. Convinced that Portland was a viable home for big-time sports, he sought to land one of the N.F.L.'s expansion franchises in the mid-1960s. He received assurances from his friend Pete Rozelle, then the league's commissioner, that it would happen if the city were to approve the construction of a 40,000-seat stadium, the Delta Dome. But the proposal fell short by about 10,000 votes, and the Delta Dome was doomed. Mr. Glickman was undeterred. As the N.B.A. sought to expand in 1970, he lined up several wealthy investors to buy one of the league's new franchises for $3.7 million. The Trail Blazers were not an immediate success. Fewer than 5,000 fans showed up on Oct. 16, 1970, for the team's first home game, a 115-112 victory over the Cleveland Cavaliers that provided false hope: The Trail Blazers were one of the worst teams in the league through their first four seasons of existence.

COPENHAGEN -- As a boy growing up in Denmark, Eske Willerslev could not wait to leave Gentofte, his suburban hometown. As soon as he was old enough, he would strike out for the Arctic wilderness. His twin brother, Rane, shared his obsession. On vacations, they retreated to the woods to teach themselves survival skills. Their first journey would be to Siberia, the Willerslev twins decided. They would make contact with a mysterious group of people called the Yukaghir, who supposedly lived on nothing but elk and moose. When the Willerslev twins reached 18, they made good on their promise. They were soon paddling a canoe up remote Siberian rivers. ""Nobody knew what you would see on the other side of a mountain,"" said Eske Willerslev, who is now 44. ""There were villages on the maps, and you wouldn't even see a trace of them.""

Dr. Willerslev spent much of the next four years in Siberia, hunting moose, traveling across empty tundra and meeting the Yukaghirs and other people of the region. The experience left him wondering about the history of ethnic groups, about how people spread across the planet. A quarter of a century later, Dr. Willerslev is still asking those questions, but now he's getting some eye-opening answers. As the director of the Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen, Dr. Willerslev uses ancient DNA to reconstruct the past 50,000 years of human history. The findings have enriched our understanding of prehistory, shedding light on human development with evidence that can't be found in pottery shards or studies of living cultures. Dr. Willerslev led the first successful sequencing of an ancient human genome, that of a 4,000-year-old Greenlander. His research on a 24,000-year-old Siberian skeleton revealed an unexpected connection between Europeans and Native Americans. Dr. Willerslev was one of the early pioneers of the study of ancient DNA, and today he remains at the forefront of an increasingly competitive field. His colleagues credit his success to his relentless work and to his skill at building international networks of collaborators.

It was on their third journey through Siberia, in 1993, that the Willerslev brothers finally found the Yukaghirs. An old man, covered in scars from hunting bears in his youth, led them to a Yukaghir village. ""It was completely different from what I imagined,"" Dr. Willerslev said. The Yukaghir were not an exotic tribe living in utter isolation. In fact, virtually all of them could count Russians and people from other ethnic groups among their ancestors. The Willerslev twins could find only a single old man who still spoke the native language. That encounter was fresh in his mind when, back in Denmark, Dr. Willerslev learned that some scientists were extracting DNA from fossil mummies, a technique that might help explain the history of people like the Yukaghir. But there was no one in Denmark doing that research, so one of Dr. Willerslev's professors suggested a Plan B. They could investigate ancient ice that climate researchers at the University of Copenhagen had brought back from Greenland. Dr. Willerslev and a fellow graduate student, Anders J. Hansen, set up a room where they could search for DNA in the ice cores. And in ice as old as 4,000 years, Dr. Willerslev and Dr. Hansen discovered DNA from 57 species of fungi, plants, algae and other organisms, dating back as far as 4,000 years. The results were so remarkable for the mid-1990s that NASA called the young doctoral student to ask about his methods. ""I got completely convinced that I wanted to become a scientist,"" Dr. Willerslev said. ""There's a big difference between reading about what others have discovered and discovering something yourself.""

Not long afterward, Dr. Willerslev discovered that the trip had been unnecessary. In the 1980s, university researchers had found a 4,000-year-old clump of hair in Greenland that had been stored -- and forgotten -- in a basement. ""It was completely ridiculous,"" Dr. Willerslev said. Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues extracted DNA from the hair and used powerful new methods to reconstruct the genome of the Greenlander. It was the first time scientists had recovered an entire ancient human genome. The hair turned out to belong to a man. His blood type was A positive, and he had a genetic predisposition for baldness. But most interesting of all, his genes contained clues about the history of Greenland and the Inuit who live there today. ""We could see these guys were not the direct ancestors of Inuit people,"" Dr. Willerslev said. Instead, the ancient Greenlander belonged to a different group known as Paleo-Eskimos. Analyzing the ancient genome, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues concluded that Paleo-Eskimos migrated from Siberia about 5,500 years ago and endured for centuries in Canada and Greenland before vanishing. The Paleo-Eskimos were not the ancestors of today's Inuits: They were replaced by them. In the six years since that report, Willerslev and his colleagues have published a series of studies that have fundamentally changed how we think about human history.

In a preliminary study, Maanasa Raghavan, a researcher at the genetics center, discovered some DNA in the remains. But the genes seemed to belong to a northern European, not an East Asian. ""I put it on hold because I thought it was completely contaminated,"" Dr. Willerslev said of the research. After he and his colleagues developed more powerful methods for analyzing DNA, Dr. Raghavan and her colleagues returned to the Mal'ta DNA. It was not contaminated: Instead, it was a genome unlike anything they expected. Parts of the boy's genome closely resembled the DNA of ancient Europeans, but more of it resembled that of Native Americans. ""It was really an eye-opener,"" Dr. Willerslev said. ""This individual has nothing to do with East Asians. He has something to do with Europeans and Native Americans."" It appears that the Mal'ta boy belonged to an ancient population spread out across Asia 24,000 years ago. They came into contact with an East Asian population at some point, and members of the two groups had children together. Native Americans are the descendants of those children.

The Mal'ta people are not related to the Asians who live in the region today. But before they disappeared, they also passed down their DNA to Europeans. Later research revealed the route those genes took from Asia to Europe. In a study published last June, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues discovered Mal'ta-like DNA in Bronze Age nomads called the Yamnaya, who lived 4,300 to 5,500 years ago in what is now southwestern Russia. About 5,000 years ago, the Yamnaya expanded into Europe, where they added their DNA to the gene pool. The new research has prompted Dr. Willerslev to give up his earlier belief that the major groups of people in different parts of the world had largely separate genetic histories. ""These results made it clear this simplified picture is not the truth,"" he said. In 2011, Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues made history once again by publishing the first genome of an aboriginal Australian. The research gave him new insights about human history. But it also taught Dr. Willerslev a lesson about the ethics involved in studying ancient DNA. Archaeological evidence shows that humans arrived in Australia at least 50,000 years ago. Scientists have long wondered if the aboriginals on the continent today are descendants of those first settlers, or of later arrivals. Dr. Willerslev saw a weakness in early genetic studies on aboriginal Australians: Many aboriginals alive today have some European ancestry. He decided to look for an aboriginal genome free of European DNA.

In 2010, he found a piece of hair collected in Australia in the 1920s at the University of Cambridge. He and his colleagues retrieved DNA from the hair and reconstructed the owner's genome. Their analysis revealed that the ancestors of aboriginal Australians split off from other non-Africans about 70,000 years ago. That finding supports the idea that the first settlers in Australia were the ancestors of today's aboriginals. Dr. Willerslev was eager to share the new finding. But one of Dr. Willerslev's co-authors, Rasmus Nielsen of the University of California, Berkeley, declared that they had made a grave mistake by not getting the consent of living aboriginal Australians. ""It didn't seem right to circumvent the wishes of the aboriginal community by using that sample,"" Dr. Nielsen said. ""I was about to remove myself from the study due to these concerns."" At first, Dr. Willerslev didn't understand the fuss. ""My view was that human history belongs to all of us because we're all connected, and no people have a right to stop our understanding of human history,"" he said. But Dr. Willerslev decided to travel to Australia to meet with aboriginal representatives. He was shaken to learn of the unethical history of scientific research on aboriginal Australians. Victorian anatomists plundered burial grounds, for example, and carried off bones to put in museums. Years of such exploitation had left many aboriginal Australians suspicious of scientists.

Today, geneticists who want to study aboriginal DNA need to obtain consent not just from donors, but from community organizations. And in many cases, there are limits on how widely scientific results can be shared. ""Paying attention now, I could see why they had this skepticism and resistance,"" Dr. Willerslev said. ""In retrospect, I should have definitely approached those people before undertaking the study. Just because it's legally right doesn't make it ethically right."" In Australia, Dr. Willerslev met with the Goldfields Land and Sea Council, which represents aboriginal people in the region where the hair sample had been obtained. He described the results of his analysis and asked for the council's consent to publish them. The council gave him permission. In fact, when the study came out, they praised the results. ""Aboriginal people feel exonerated in showing the broader community that they are by far the oldest continuous civilization in the world,"" the council said in a statement. His experiences in Australia have changed the way Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues investigate DNA from indigenous people. ""I've evolved,"" he said.

But Dr. Mahli decided to join the team when Dr. Willerslev began meeting with local tribes. ""My mind changed when I realized Eske was engaging with these communities,"" he said. ""He has been great through all of this,"" Jackie M. Cook, the repatriation specialist for the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation, said of Dr. Willerslev. The Kennewick Man genome, like the Anzick child's, revealed an ancient continuity between living Native Americans and the earliest people in the New World. After Dr. Willerslev and his colleagues published their results last year, John Novembre of the University of Chicago confirmed them at the request of the Army Corps of Engineers. Dr. Willerslev has mixed feelings about the consequences of his research on Kennewick Man. ""I'm a scientist, and it means I regret that important material is getting reburied,"" he said. ""But when you find that these remains are genetically Native Americans, it's not our call anymore."" Since the Kennewick Man project, Dr. Willerslev has hosted visits from a number of Native American tribes to his laboratory in Copenhagen. His guests have helped him see how differently he, as a European, treats history than they do. Dr. Willerslev once proudly showed off a collection of ancient Danish skulls to Native American visitors, only to find them upset by the sight. ""'How can you treat your ancestors like that, so disrespectfully?"" he recalls them asking. In December, Dr. Willerslev hosted Dr. Doyle along with Ben Cloud and Frank Caplett, also members of the Crow Nation. Dr. Willerslev took them around the lab and proposed research he hoped the tribe would consider.

Dr. Willerslev would like to investigate the influence of genes on the high rate of diabetes in Native Americans, for example. He has started similar work in Australia. Mr. Cloud said he was intrigued by the idea. ""I have family members who were younger than I am who are gone because of this disease,"" he said. ""How come my family is dying?"" Dr. Willerslev also raised the possibility of studying Crow DNA to understand their history. Dr. Doyle said he doubted the tribe would be interested. ""We've had white people coming in and telling us things for a long time, and it's never really impressed us much,"" he said. Dr. Willerslev accepts that kind of rejection as part of his work. ""We have to respect that as scientists,"" he said. ""We don't have to agree.""",The world-renowned geneticist scrutinizes ancient DNA for clues to the earliest chapters in the human story.,a287abd3-0ab7-54de-b510-ed32978a4473,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/05/17/science/17WILLERSLEVCOVER/17WILLERSLEVCOVER-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=75086130cc8bc32daaa876f0d8b3ba90dafe563a5b6f3543269e630ae2c8ffdc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. Eske Willerslev, director of the Center for GeoGenetics at the University of Copenhagen, earlier this month.",a287abd3-0ab7-54de-b510-ed32978a4473,N24News/imgs/a287abd3-0ab7-54de-b510-ed32978a4473.jpg,2

Books,"Jill Paton Walsh, Multigenerational Writer, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/18/books/jill-paton-walsh-dead.html,"Jill Paton Walsh in 1995. After winning acclaim as an author of books for young adults, she achieved new success the next year with her first adult book, ""Knowledge of Angels.""



Her books for young readers had won acclaim when, in 1994, one for adults made the Booker Prize shortlist -- but only after she had resorted to publishing it herself.

Jill Paton Walsh was greeted with acclaim in the 1960s when she began writing young-adult books that challenged her readers in both plotting and messaging. There was ""Fireweed"" (1970), a story of two British adolescents who set up housekeeping in a bombed-out building during World War II. There was ""Goldengrove"" (1972), about two youths who navigate the transition from childhood to adulthood during an eventful summer. But in 1994 Ms. Paton Walsh achieved a whole different level of acclaim, by an unlikely route, with a book for adults, ""Knowledge of Angels,"" a genre-defying medieval fable about an atheist and a girl raised by wolves. Here she delved into themes of faith and reason and more. Yet despite her success with books for young readers, ""Knowledge of Angels"" struggled to assert itself: No one in her native England would publish it. ""British publishers wouldn't even say what they didn't like about it,"" Ms. Paton Walsh told The Daily Mail of London that year, ""so I couldn't even change it to suit them.""

And so, in a move that was rare for the time, she published it herself -- and had the last laugh. The book was shortlisted for the Booker Prize, one of the top literary awards in the world, and is said to be the first self-published book to make that elite list. Peter Lewis of The Daily Mail had a crisp rebuke for all those publishers -- 19 was the final count -- who had said no to the book. ""To open it and start reading,"" he wrote, ""is to be appalled by their lack of judgment."" Ms. Paton Walsh died on Oct. 18 in a hospital in Huntingdon, England, near Cambridge. She was 83 and also lived in Huntingdon. Oliver Soden, her literary executor, said the cause was heart and kidney failure. Ms. Paton Walsh was a versatile writer whose more than two dozen books included several in the Lord Peter Wimsey detective series, which had been created by Dorothy L. Sayers (1893-1957). She completed ""Thrones, Dominations"" (1998), which Ms. Sayers had begun in the 1930s but never finished. Then Ms. Paton Walsh wrote three of her own Wimsey books, ""A Presumption of Death"" (2002), ""The Attenbury Emeralds"" (2010) and ""The Late Scholar"" (2014).

As a child, Gillian spent part of the World War II years in Cornwall, on the coast. ""A part of me is still rooted in that rocky shore,"" she wrote in the autobiographical series ""Something About the Author,"" ""and it appears again and again in what I write."" Several of her young-adult books have a seaside setting. She attended St. Anne's College, Oxford, graduating in 1959, and recalled listening to lectures there by J.R.R. Tolkien and C.S. Lewis. ""The subject of the lectures and tutorials was always literature or philology -- we wouldn't have dared ask those great men about their own work! -- but the example they set by being both great and serious scholars, and writers of fantasy and books for children, was not lost on me,"" she wrote in the autobiographical essay. She married Antony Edmund Paton Walsh in 1961 and had her first child with him. Finding domestic life somewhat drab, she began writing to relieve her boredom. An editor at Macmillan told her that her first manuscript wasn't good enough but took an option on whatever she would produce next. That was ""Hengest's Tale,"" which she described as ""a gory epic retold out of fragments of 'Beowulf.'"" In 1966, it became her first published book. Next came ""The Dolphin Crossing"" (1967), followed by ""Fireweed."" Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1970, the British children's book author and editor John Rowe Townsend called it ""an outstanding novel for young people: original, haunting, poetic."" Mr. Townsend would soon become a much bigger part of her life: They met in the early 1970s and began a relationship, although she remained with her husband until their children were grown. (He did not want a divorce because of his Roman Catholic faith; she had been raised in the church but called herself ""a lifelong lapsed Catholic."")

Her next young adult book, ""Goldengrove,"" was about two youngsters accustomed to spending summers at their grandmother's seaside home and how one particular summer changed everything. Writing in The Times Book Review, Barbara Wersba, herself an author of young adult books, praised Ms. Paton Walsh's ability to write ""as though she were still 12 years old."" But, she wrote, that didn't mean that Ms. Paton Walsh's books were juvenile. ""I find it significant that 'Goldengrove' will be marketed for children between the ages of 11 and 14,"" Ms. Wersba wrote, ""and never reach their parents. The current division of fiction into Lots of Sex for the grown-ups and Less Sex for the kids is not only silly but wasteful, for the grown-ups are missing some beautiful and highly original work."" Ms. Paton Walsh aged the ""Goldengrove"" characters in ""Unleaving"" (1976). In 1979, with ""A Chance Child,"" she gave readers a compelling look at child labor in the 19th century. This 1979 book by Ms. Paton Walsh gave readers a compelling look at child labor in the 19th century. Her goal with her works for children, she told The Guardian in 1994, was to convey to them ""that whatever they think of the world, it is actually much more complicated."" ""I hope to show them how difficult it is to make judgments,"" she said, ""how often the bad person turns out to be good, that life is unexpected."" She tried her first novel for adults, ""Lapsing,"" in 1988. A tale about an Oxford undergraduate, the book drew on her own experiences with faith and love and earned good notices. So did a second novel for adults the next year, ""A School for Lovers."" But sales were modest, and when she shopped the ambitious ""Knowledge of Angels,"" there were no takers in her home country -- though Houghton Mifflin had already published the book in the United States. The Guardian would describe it as ""a compelling medieval fable centered on the conflict between belief and tolerance, and veined with a complex philosophical argument about the existence of God.""","Her books for young readers had won acclaim when, in 1994, one for adults made the Booker Prize shortlist — but only after she had resorted to publishing it herself.",99dffd7b-d2a4-5e45-bd5d-43d2414fa14b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/23/obituaries/23Walsh-obit1/16Walsh1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=319b19e2f94b3afcee64307545f36f3c4bbf889985900fdcb8dc3d345f6d60b6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jill Paton Walsh in 1995.

Opinion,Congress Must Be Clear: No Doctored Videos,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/03/opinion/steve-scalise-ady-barkan-video.html,"The editorial board is a group of opinion journalists whose views are informed by expertise, research, debate and certain longstanding values . It is separate from the newsroom.



It is disturbing enough that American democracy is being threatened by disinformation, the proliferation of which is facilitated by the shadier side of modern technology -- phony websites, social-media bots, manipulated video and audio, digitally fabricated ""deepfakes."" How painful to be reminded that among the bad actors spreading such chaos and division are prominent elected officials sworn to serve the public. Last weekend, Representative Steve Scalise, the Louisiana Republican, shared a video clip featuring Ady Barkan, a progressive activist, asking Joe Biden, ""Do we agree that we can redirect some of the funding for police?"" To which Mr. Biden responded, ""Yes, absolutely."" Except that Mr. Barkan, who has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and communicates with the aid of a computerized voice, had not included the words ""for police"" in his question. Those were spliced in by Mr. Scalise's team, making it seem as though Mr. Biden was expressing direct support for defunding the police -- something he explicitly opposes, no matter how loudly Republicans claim otherwise. Mr. Biden's criminal justice plan, in fact, includes $300 million in additional funding for police departments. Outraged by the violation, Mr. Barkan called out the congressman. ""@SteveScalise, These are not my words,"" he tweeted on Sunday afternoon. ""I have lost my ability to speak, but not my agency or my thoughts. You and your team have doctored my words for your own political gain. Please remove this video immediately. You owe the entire disability community an apology.""

On Wednesday, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee filed a complaint against Mr. Scalise with the Office of Congressional Ethics, the independent entity tasked with reviewing allegations from the public about congressional misconduct. If deemed appropriate, the complaint could be referred to the House Ethics Committee. This is a welcome development, but it is not enough. The idea that Mr. Scalise is uniquely unscrupulous -- that he is the only lawmaker who will let his partisan passions and ambitions get the better of him -- is naive. Before the situation devolves further, both chambers of Congress need to establish strict policies prohibiting lawmakers and staff members from engaging in this kind of dupery and clarifying the penalties for violations. So far, Mr. Scalise seems not to grasp the gravity of his offense. He initially responded to Mr. Barkan's criticism by tweeting more attacks on Democrats. Twitter flagged the disputed video as ""manipulated."" Sunday night, the congressman bowed to the outcry, tweeting that he would remove the clip, even as he argued that he was in the right.

Mr. Scalise has clung to this defense, repeatedly insisting that the video was merely ""edited"" to capture the true essence of Mr. Biden's longer, more involved exchange with Mr. Barkan on police reform. ""We paired the police portion with Barkan's final question for clarity because we couldn't include an entire three-minute clip in a one-minute montage,"" Mr. Scalise's spokesman told The Washington Post. But, as even Mr. Scalise acknowledged to Fox News, the video should not have been altered. Period. No matter how low-tech or minor the manipulation, it crossed a line, putting the congressman on the wrong side of a battle in which the bad guys are ascendant. It's not as though he didn't know any better. The House Ethics Committee issued a memo in January warning against the ""intentional use of audiovisual distortions and deep fakes."" Posting doctored material could harm public discourse, erode the public trust and ""reflect discreditably on the House,"" the committee noted. ""Accordingly, members, officers and employees posting deep fakes or other audiovisual distortions intended to mislead the public may be in violation of the Code of Official Conduct."" The memo stressed that shifting the blame onto rogue staffers was not a legitimate excuse. The Ethics Committee has a range of options for dealing with misbehavior by members -- from issuing a letter of reproval (which requires the support of only a majority of committee members) to recommending monetary fines, a formal reprimand or even censure by the full House. Party leadership has other, more informal options, such as stripping members of committee seats or other privileges. Historically, Congress has not been great about policing its own, and members may ultimately decide to give Mr. Scalise a pass for this infraction. This would be a mistake. His deception ought to serve as a red flag. Going forward, the House needs sturdier guardrails and more specific guidelines making clear that it will not tolerate any attempt to defraud the American people through doctored video and audio. The spread of political disinformation is a danger to the nation, one likely to get worse before it gets better. ""Since we can't rely on the responsibility of individual actors or the platforms they use, I fully expect there will be a proliferation of these sorts of fictions to a degree that nearly drowns out actual facts,"" warned Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democrat, in 2018, about the rise of video manipulation tools. Congress needs to get serious about discouraging its own ranks from fueling the problem.",A congressman posted a manipulated video.

Dance,Review: 'ChimaTEK' Offers Crystal Visions at a Transit Hub,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/arts/dance/review-chimatek-offers-crystal-visions-at-a-transit-hub.html,"As three dancers -- the piece's choreographer, Aimee Meredith Cox, as well as Freyani Patrice and Kenya Joy Gibson -- make their way down escalators and a winding staircase to the lower base of the multilevel center, three-dimensional crystals featuring diamond mosaics and propellers dance alongside them.

Some preparation is in order: To see these floating crystals, you must first download the Refrakt application and aim your smartphone on a design on the dancers' dresses. When it works -- and you have to be close enough -- a crystal suddenly appears to hover around the dancer's body. Spookily beautiful, these crystals help you reimagine space and time. Are the dancers impersonating the crystals, or is the crystal a guise? As the barefoot dancers incorporate lush African undulations and hold still positions with such focus and poise that they could be sculptures, even the hectic Fulton Center quiets down.

When they reach ground level, Ms. Cox, the leader of the group, dances before Ms. Patrice and Ms. Gibson while holding an iPad to reveal the crystals; it's as if she's demonstrating, wordlessly, how the application works. But the action also enhances the dreamlike quality of the dance in which a duet -- with the help of a crystal -- becomes a trio. Their exit is most haunting: Ascending escalators, they glide away.","Saya Woolfalk's Fulton Center creation, combining dance, video, animation and sculpture, features floating crystals, if you have the right app to see them.",0de6da14-dcd2-5324-be99-c7ec91f99df5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/18/arts/18CHIMATEK1/18CHIMATEK1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=16e6dbca4cd596aa80c8dd0ef084675cb9bf01b525b59c6650ee1d72da6a1674&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Aimee Meredith Cox, left, and Fréyani Patrice in ""ChimaTEK: Chimacloud Control Center"" by Saya Woolfalk at the Fulton Center on Thursday.",0de6da14-dcd2-5324-be99-c7ec91f99df5,N24News/imgs/0de6da14-dcd2-5324-be99-c7ec91f99df5.jpg,6
Theater,How 'Wolves' and 'Heroes' Are Saving Pandemic Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/06/theater/wolves-and-heroes-virtual-theater.html,"Serious new plays are always in danger of disappearing -- never more so than now. But inventive virtual productions, such as ""The Wolves"" and ""Heroes of the Fourth Turning,"" offer hope.

It's all well and good that some theaters are making money during the pandemic by producing what can only be called quasi-theater: magic shows, murder mysteries, a hundred variations on ""A Christmas Carol."" I won't congratulate them here; let their income be its own reward. With luck, they may keep the spark of performance alive to light another night. The theaters I want to acknowledge now are those that are producing plays of artistic merit in an environment even more hostile to them than usual. That's a tougher job, but it's the one that will make the eventual reopening of our stages worth the effort. These are companies that have doubled down on meaty classics and serious new work, reconfiguring whole seasons for socially distanced delivery systems. Look at the of-the-minute short films from the Steppenwolf Theater Company, the updated verse comedies from Moliere in the Park and the all-audio lineup of seven productions from the Williamstown Theater Festival and Audible. Between new work and classics, though, lies an especially endangered category: recent plays that were emerging into the wider culture after successful New York debuts when the pandemic curtailed their options for production. Lacking familiar titles, and demanding the most thoughtful attention to language and ideas, these plays do not immediately suggest themselves as quick profit centers in an industry trying to pivot on a dime.

So it was heartening, earlier this fall, to see the Maryland-based Olney Theater Center present such an inventive Zoom version of ""The Humans,"" Stephen Karam's 2015 play about a family's economic and spiritual upheaval. Also heartening: Early next year, Dominique Morisseau's ""Paradise Blue,"" a jazz noir drama seen at the Signature Theater in New York in 2018, will get the Williamstown-Audible treatment for which it seems, in its intense musicality, even better suited. Right now, though, I'm floating on the high of seeing, in new formats, two plays I loved the first time around. One is Sarah DeLappe's ""The Wolves,"" a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 2017 that the Philadelphia Theater Company is offering in an exhilarating Zoom staging through Dec. 20. The other, Will Arbery's ""Heroes of the Fourth Turning,"" a Pulitzer finalist earlier this year, can be seen through Dec. 13 in a devastating film-theater hybrid from the Wilma Theater, also in Philadelphia. These are not just dramas; they were considerable dramas to produce. To begin with, ""The Wolves"" has a big cast; it follows nine teenage girls on an indoor soccer team for several months as they stretch, literally and figuratively. Expectations for it were big as well. Paige Price, the company's producing artistic director, said ""The Wolves"" had already been breaking advance sale records when local Covid-19 regulations forced her to shut down production two days before rehearsals were to begin in March.

But as the summer progressed, so did the flexibility of the technology. By sending each actor not only her costumes and props (crutches from Amazon!) but also her own sound equipment and green screen kit, the production team was able to vary the framing in each Zoom box, a huge improvement on early pandemic experiments that were basically neck-up and as visually interesting as tic-tac-toe. On the other hand, because the theater couldn't afford to send high-resolution cameras -- the budget for the show was $55,000 instead of the $350,000 that might have been spent onstage -- the production had to make do with smartphone footage that rendered full-screen close-ups unusable. In the end, the tech restrictions and handmade quality of the images do not detract from the story. With nine players, the 3-by-3 Zoom grid turns out to be a powerfully expressive element. This is, after all, a play that consists almost entirely of girls caught in the act of growing up, using their pack identity -- the team is called the Wolves -- as a kind of privacy screen behind which they become individuals. What at first appears to be a single organ, like an insect's compound eye, turns out, upon Zoom inspection, to be many. The cast is excellent, landing the jokes no less than the pathos. But what really stands out in this virtual production is the way DeLappe had already shaped the audience's experience to parallel the girls'. We only slowly discern specific lives within the undifferentiated mass of faces and jerseys. (Amusingly, for Zoom purposes, the jerseys have their numbers facing front instead of back.) As we are discovering them, they are discovering themselves.

""Heroes of the Fourth Turning"" is a much more despairing play, less about discovery than about deepening confusion. In a series of painful confrontations, it tests the moral clarity of its main characters: four young adults associated with a deeply conservative Catholic college in Wyoming. What it finds, over the course of a night, soon after a protester was killed at a white nationalist demonstration in Charlottesville, Va., is that they all struggle with beliefs they can no longer make sense of. To pack so much pain and intensity into a Zoom grid would have been an aesthetic monstrosity, a Greek drama on the set of ""The Hollywood Squares."" So when the Wilma's planned stage production was, like ""The Wolves,"" shut down, its director, Blanka Zizka, who is also one of the company's four co-artistic directors, decided instead to recreate ""Heroes"" as a digital, site-specific production. For two and a half weeks, the actors and crew quarantined together in five Airbnb rentals in the Pocono Mountains. The backyard of one of the Airbnbs was their set; the night was their soundscape, complete with dying crickets that ruined takes.

The play is so tightly written and so specific about its characters that I was not surprised to find the finished production, at least at first, closely mirroring Danya Taymor's superb original staging for Playwrights Horizons. But very soon, when the camera panned up from the scene of the four young people drinking and jawing and wrangling over faith to a shot of Orion in a massively starry sky, Zizka's version, the first since Taymor's, took on a completely different aspect, more cosmic if perhaps less personal than the original. The virtual experience of a real place -- as opposed to what live theater gives you: a real experience of a virtual place -- bends the mind toward abstractions. The play works beautifully that way too, and Zizka clearly relished the new opportunities that filming offered. Reverse angles and close-ups vary the composition and also provide the chance, unavailable in theater, to tell a story partly by showing how characters are listening. ""Theater audiences will only look at who's speaking,"" Zizka said. The downside? ""The theater is not a building, it's people -- actors and audiences confronting each other,"" she continued. ""But now that the play is running, it's lonely. I have no idea what anyone is feeling."" Well, I know what I was feeling: once again shattered. And the good news for ""Heroes,"" as for ""The Wolves,"" is that pandemic productions as fine as these will keep shattering audiences until they can reassemble to confront live theater again.

Media,Who's Behind the Fight Between Warner Bros. and Hollywood? It's AT&T,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/08/business/media/hbo-max-subscribers-att-box-office-losses.html,"Timothee Chalamet and Rebecca Ferguson in ""Dune,"" a Warner Bros. film that will make its debut simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max.





Even a small sample of the Warner Bros. 2021 film slate suggests the studio's big-screen ambitions: a desert-planet messiah who can kill with a word (""Dune""); a colossal clash between mutant monsters (""Godzilla vs. Kong""); a local hero who whips up frenzied dance routines across uptown rooftops (""In the Heights""). They're the kind of movies that families, couples and teenagers once watched on three-story screens from the comfort of stadium-style seats, with the soundtrack's bass notes rumbling at their feet. But last week Warner Bros. broke with tradition by announcing that it would release its entire lineup of 2021 films on HBO Max -- its struggling streaming service -- on the same day they were scheduled to appear in theaters. Hollywood agents and filmmakers were angered by the move -- but they may have forgotten something crucial: Warner Bros. belongs to WarnerMedia, which is part of AT&T. And AT&T is a telecommunications company whose interests are sometimes at odds with those of the old entertainment business. Despite joining Hollywood in a big way last year, when it bought Time Warner for more than $80 billion, AT&T may not mind so much if it speeds the demise of the century-old moviegoing habit. For AT&T, HBO Max isn't just a convenient way to get films and television shows to the public. Instead, the platform is a key part of its wireless business. HBO Max is included in packages for some high-end phone and internet subscribers, and it exists, in part, to create consumer loyalty to AT&T.

The Warner Bros. films will also play in theaters -- but seeing them that way would cost a family of four about $50 (excluding gas, parking and concessions). That makes the monthly $15 fee for HBO Max a steal. Or even a no-brainer. Especially at a time of dread caused by being part of a crowd during the coronavirus pandemic. The studio's emphasis on streaming certainly puts AT&T at risk of losing money on its 2021 films. But the box office has already been hollowed out because of the pandemic, with every major studio stutter-stepping its way into various release strategies.

Jason Kilar, the WarnerMedia chief executive who helped craft the strategy, could have settled on a more patient distribution scheme, given that coronavirus vaccines might salvage some of the 2021 box office. Instead, he did something audacious by potentially sacrificing billions in box office receipts to boost the $15-a-month streaming platform. Mr. Kilar was early to streaming, starting his run as the chief executive of Hulu in 2007. For those who knew him then, his moves at WarnerMedia have not been much of a surprise.

The director Christopher Nolan, who made ""Tenet"" for Warner Bros. and is known as a proponent of theatrically released movies, swiftly condemned the studio's plan to release its movies simultaneously in theaters and on HBO Max. ""Their decision makes no economic sense, and even the most casual Wall Street investor can see the difference between disruption and dysfunction,"" he said in a statement Monday to The Hollywood Reporter. He went on to call HBO Max ""the worst streaming service."" But a strategy that strikes auteurs and cinema die-hards as dysfunctional makes perfect sense to Mr. Kilar and Mr. Stankey. AT&T's primary focus is its wireless service, a $71 billion business. WarnerMedia generates half that. More important, the wireless industry brings in significantly more money than the entertainment business -- and it does so in a much more efficient manner. AT&T's wireless division makes three times the pretax profit brought in by WarnerMedia. Mr. Kilar did not endear himself to the entertainment establishment during his time at Hulu, and now he seems to have aggravated the content creators who make Hollywood run. But the company he works for has very little in common with other entertainment outfits. For AT&T, HBO Max isn't just a way to make money, but serves as an incentive to keep phone customers from defecting to its rivals. Every 0.01 percent of customers who stay glued to AT&T are worth about $100 million to the company. A pricing war among AT&T, Verizon and T-Mobile has lowered mobile phone bills and cut into profits. Wireless providers have taken to stealing subscribers away from one another -- a costly practice that includes discounting.

AT&T still wants HBO Max to be as profitable as possible. But even if its balance sheet suffers, the platform can still be valuable if it helps the company hang on to wireless subscribers. In the streaming competition that has heated up in recent years, HBO Max finds itself up against some serious heavyweights. Netflix is closing in on 201 million customers around the world, with nearly 70 million in the United States. Disney+ has had a fast rise to more than 73 million. Hulu, also controlled by Disney, has about 37 million. As of this week -- six months after its introduction -- HBO Max had 12.6 million subscribers, or ""activations,"" as the company calls them. Those subscribers are, in effect, getting free tickets to the 2021 slate of Warner Bros. films. And it's not just them -- members of their family are also able to watch, as well as anyone else who shares their login information. People who are interested in seeing ""Wonder Woman 1984"" or ""Dune"" without risking a trip to a movie theater have a strong incentive to plunk down $15 for a month of HBO Max. They can watch what they want to see and quickly cancel. Or maybe they will stick around for all 17 films on the 2021 slate. But how will AT&T make up for the inevitable loss of revenue from theatrically released movies? WarnerMedia's average box office revenue tops $1.8 billion annually, according to estimates by the research firm MoffettNathanson, an amount that the studio must split with theater chains. That means AT&T will have to make up about $900 million in 2021 film revenue. To be sure, AT&T will rake in some box office dollars next year. But the pandemic has dampened even the best-laid marketing plans. When WarnerMedia released ""Tenet"" in theaters in September, the $200 million project generated only about $57 million domestically.

It will also make some money through online rentals and purchases, as well as in cable syndication. Mr. Kilar could come out ahead, pleasing Mr. Stankey and AT&T shareholders while potentially upsetting much of the Hollywood establishment. He needs to get only five million more HBO Max customers to make up for box office losses (or 60 million customers paying for only a single month). That would be on top of the 25 million subscribers it's already on pace to gather by May. But solving the market may not be as easy as it looks. HBO Max is the most expensive streamer, at $180 a year.","The town is mad about the studio's decision to put movies on HBO Max and in theaters at the same time.

Fashion & Style,"Shunned by Vogue, Joan Juliet Buck Seeks Inner Peace",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/16/fashion/joan-juliet-buck-vogue-paris-memoir-conde-nast.html,"RHINECLIFF, N.Y. -- When Joan Juliet Buck completed the first draft of her new memoir, ""The Price of Illusion,"" for Atria Books, the manuscript was over a thousand pages. ""It was like a deposition,"" she said, an apt description considering the material she had to cover. In 2000 Ms. Buck, known for being the only American woman to edit Vogue Paris, was abruptly dismissed after nearly seven years there, and sent to rehab by her boss, Jonathan Newhouse, chairman of Conde Nast International, for a drug problem she did not have. (Though she said she agreed to go because it was part of her severance package, she also admitted that with a writer's perverse curiosity, she wanted to see firsthand what went on in a drug-treatment center.) Eleven years later, as a contributing writer for American Vogue, Ms. Buck received a different sort of public drubbing. She had been assigned a profile of the first lady of Syria, Asma al-Assad, a piece that was published under the cringe-making headline, ""A Rose in the Desert,"" just weeks before the Assad regime began torturing and bombing its own people. In the aftermath, Ms. Buck was exposed to the outrage of the internet, and Vogue declined to renew her contract. (Months later, the article was scrubbed from the magazine's website, and Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor, issued a statement deploring ""the actions of the Assad regime in the strongest possible terms."")

On a recent Monday afternoon, Ms. Buck, husky-voiced and animated, was in the basement of the Morton Memorial Library, a corner of which she rents as an office and has outfitted like a Bedouin's tent. She has been holed up here, on and off, for the last three years, working on her memoir and trying to shed, not altogether successfully, the material relics of her former life. (She rents an apartment in nearby Rhinebeck.) Last year, she auctioned off a Cartier watch, Hermes and Chanel bags and her mother's sapphire-studded compact, along with more idiosyncratic belongings, like a collection of R. Crumb comics. Ms. Buck's library has been only slightly culled to 7,000 volumes, which are spread out between a storage unit in Poughkeepsie and on walls of steel bookcases in this basement. In the wake of the Assad piece, Ms. Buck, now 68, said she was ""tainted, like a leper,"" and developed lesions on her feet that still cause her to limp slightly. Still, she had her defenders.

""I think she was very shabbily treated by Vogue,"" said Tina Brown, who has edited two Conde Nast titles, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker. ""Frankly, it was an editing responsibility. You don't just blame the writer. Not renewing her contract was harsh and she had no doubt why it was. The fact is, the piece comes in, there are a lot of eyes on it, and a lot of discussions. For Joan to be excommunicated for her work was very shabby."" (A spokesperson for the magazine declined to weigh in.) Ms. Buck said: ""There was so much opprobrium sticking to me. I was so flayed. My life as I knew it had vanished. And so it was a process of trying to figure out, Where did I come from? Where am I going? What really happened? I didn't know, until I wrote the book, that I had the right to my own life, that I could tell my own story."" Ms. Buck's first memories are of a pink palace outside of Paris, a 19th-century copy of the Grand Trianon and an early stop on her parent's self-exile from McCarthy-era Hollywood. Her father, Jules Buck, was a movie producer whose best friend was John Huston, an Army buddy whose life he had saved. Mr. Buck struggled to find work after leaving Los Angeles. Ms. Buck's mother, Joyce, was an actress whose best friend was Lauren Bacall. At the pink palace, Jacques Tati and Federico Fellini were impish dinner guests. Ms. Buck learned to speak French before English, setting Frenchness firmly inside her, as she writes, ""as a hunger for rules and form that went unmet in the margins of my family's fantasy of a beautiful French life."" When a French nanny told her that her Jewish family had killed Jesus Christ, Ms. Buck, just 7, apologized politely. The Bucks landed in London, where Jules would discover a young Peter O'Toole and arrange to have him cast in ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" after which the two men formed a film company. Ms. Buck grew up partly in the eccentric households of the Hustons, playing dress-up with Anjelica Huston, a surrogate sister. Jules's fortunes rose with Mr. O'Toole's, only to vanish when they had a falling out over ""The Ruling Class,"" their 1972 film. Hurt and humiliated, Jules was later found to be a manic depressive.

In her book, Ms. Buck gives her sexual guardedness a Marxist interpretation, ""a question of ownership,"" as she writes. ""I belonged to my father until I could earn my own way."" Unsure of her looks, she would nonetheless have love affairs with Donald Sutherland, Eric Rothschild, Jerry Brown and a married European academic with whom she stayed involved for 15 years. Leonard Cohen was an admirer. Since her teens Ms. Buck has scrupulously noted dialogue in her diaries, which she has saved. ""I'd think, 'Oh, he hasn't called, did I say the wrong thing?'"" she said. ""The only way I could get a handle on what had happened every day was to write down what people said, not what I felt."" Of Mr. Brown, she writes that he told her, ""You're part of this vague elite, you don't come from anywhere, you don't represent anything."" Ms. Buck once worked for Jeanne Moreau as an assistant, and for Guy Bourdin, the French fashion photographer. She met Andy Warhol when she was 22, and he made her the London correspondent for Interview magazine. ""I became a slightly plump It Girl,"" she writes. When Ms. Buck and the English writer John Heilpern, now a contributor to Vanity Fair, married in London in the late '70s, her friend Karl Lagerfeld made her wedding dress; Manolo Blahnik, a friend since they were teenagers, was her attendant. (That dress, a ruffled mauve confection, now lives in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.)

She recalled a fight toward the end of the marriage, when Mr. Heilpern accused her of coming to New York to be a success, and she accused him of wanting to be a failure. ""Then he said,"" as Ms. Buck remembered, ""'And neither of us got what we wanted.'"" Ms. Huston described Ms. Buck as someone ""who combines essences of Coco Chanel and Isabelle Eberhardt"" -- the cross-dressing, 19th-century Swiss adventuress and author. ""She likes potent things,"" she added. ""I think Joan has a good deal of courage, and often finds herself in rather stringent situations, and maybe she has a taste for that."" The rehab saga is a fine example. When Ms. Buck checked into the Arizona clinic, the required drug and alcohol tests came back clean. Its director was mystified when Ms. Buck begged to stay. ""I have nowhere else to go,"" she told her.

Absent a diagnosis, Ms. Buck was put in a room with suicide survivors. Noting that her father was bipolar, she wondered if there was a test for that, too. When those results, from the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, also came back ""normal,"" save for ""some evidence of paranoia"" -- Ms. Buck had answered ""yes"" to the statement, ""People are plotting against me"" -- she signed up for kickboxing, Adult Children of Alcoholics, Sex Addicts Anonymous and Anger Management. While she was there, Mr. Heilpern sent her a clipping from Page Six reporting she had punched her publisher. When Ms. Buck called her lawyer to ask, ""Is that legal?"" he replied that she was a public figure and had no recourse. Ms. Buck was incredulous: ""The editor of French Vogue is a public figure?""

Ms. Buck will tell you she was miscast as its editor, but others will disagree. She upended what had been the magazine's rather staid coverage, often devoting its pages to single-topic themes, like film, sex and quantum physics. She also nearly doubled its circulation. ""It was the best period of French Vogue,"" Mr. Blahnik said. Ms. Brown said: ""To me, she transformed the magazine. I thought she brought a wonderfully intellectual raised eyebrow to the whole thing. It became a magazine that people talked about."" She added that she was baffled by the rehab tale. ""I don't know why it happened,"" Ms. Brown said. Ms. Buck said that when she asked Mr. Newhouse why he thought she was a drug addict, he told her that he was concerned because she had lost weight, a surprising response from an executive overseeing a Vogue title. (A spokesman for Mr. Newhouse said he wasn't available for comment.) A story had also circulated about syringes falling out of her purse onto the floor. In the book, Ms. Buck speculates that the syringe rumor derived from her habit of carrying vials of seawater given to her by a spa and tipping them into drinks, to boost her electrolytes. During the recent Hudson Valley visit, there was much spritzing from a small bottle of lavender and thyme oil, a product she picked up from Catherine Deneuve, and which she pressed into a visitor's hands as a prophylactic against the germs of other passengers on the train home.

After French Vogue and the rehab stint, Ms. Buck moved to Santa Fe, looking to make a home for her aged father, who had been in her care through much of her time in Paris, though he died before she was able to move him there. (Early in her tenure at French Vogue, her mother had died of lung cancer.) ""She picked up the tradition of the men and women who used to inhabit Santa Fe,"" said Richard Buckley, a former editor of Vogue Homme, ""the black sheep who didn't belong anywhere else and could be who they wanted to be there. And she gave pretty good parties. I don't mean wild parties where people are hanging off the chandeliers, just ones with interesting people.

Art & Design,How a Love of French Art Helped Shape the American Republic,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/15/arts/design/french-paintings-america-collects-bazille-national-gallery-review.html,"WASHINGTON -- ""I know you are a very great nation,"" Emmanuel Macron told us this month, ""and that the United States was founded to let freedom, truth and reason prevail over ignorance and darkness."" The young French president was hastily speaking, in English and French, just before midnight after his American counterpart announced he would withdraw the United States from the landmark climate agreement forged in Paris in 2015. Mr. Macron -- whom the French press occasionally mocks for his American-style communications -- knew just how to win Yankee hearts. Go back to the origins of his nation and ours: back to the 18th century, and to ideals that no one can repeal. We may scrap and snipe like any old couple, but the United States and France can't ever be truly untangled. The ties go too far back, a point reinforced at the National Gallery of Art, just down the National Mall from where President Trump said he represented ""Pittsburgh, not Paris,"" in an exhibition of art from before and after our respective revolutions. ""America Collects Eighteenth-Century French Painting"" brings together more than five dozen works, by the ancien regime flatterer Francois Boucher (1703-1770), the Jacobin painter Jacques-Louis David (1748-1825) and more obscure names too. It also maps the American taste for French art through loans from museums in 25 states: not just the Met and the Frick and the Getty but places like Alabama's Birmingham Museum of Art, which has one of this country's most extensive Rococo collections. ""America Collects"" is one half of a rocking double feature of French art in the United States capital. In the East Building of the National Gallery is ""Frederic Bazille and the Birth of Impressionism,"" an exceptional showcase of a contemporary of Monet and Renoir. Bazille pushed the boundaries of realism but died before he was 30, in 1870.

""America Collects"" tells a largely by-the-book story of the French 18th century across eight stylishly hung bays. In the early 1700s, the Baroque gave way to the more sentimental Rococo style, typified by soft pinks and blues, light curves and amorous gods and maidens. Eight paintings by Boucher in this exhibition epitomize the mature Rococo, among them a soft-edged portrait (lent by the Harvard Art Museums) of Madame de Pompadour, Louis XV's mistress, as well as ""The Toilette of Venus"" and ""The Bath of Venus,"" twin pictures of that nude goddess cocooned in silks and smothered by cherubs. Figures harden as the French Revolution approaches, and the century ends with an erasure of froufrou and a praise of moral virtues drawn from Greek and Roman examples.

So far, so 18th. The more interesting narrative, though, is the American one that ripples beneath this show: how a nonaristocratic elite in a new nation embraced and made use of French art from the Enlightenment. As early as 1815, the year a defeated Napoleon was exiled to St. Helena, his older brother, Joseph Bonaparte, arrived in the United States with a trunk full of French paintings. He displayed them at his country house in New Jersey, and sometimes lent them to new American academies. One of his prizes was Noel-Nicolas Coypel's ""The Abduction of Europa"" (1726-27), now at the Philadelphia Museum of Art: Zeus, in the form of a bull, carries Europa through a churning sea, while water nymphs surf on goggle-eyed fish and putti divebomb the waves. It may look dainty and vaporous now, but to art lovers in the new American republic, this was the hottest of imports, and an example to live up to. French portraiture, too, offered Americans a means to ground themselves in an 18th-century tradition -- though it also afforded a nice way to decorate. There are a few neo-Classical examples here, such as the sassy selfie ""Le Discret"" (circa 1791), in which Joseph Ducreux paints himself shushing the spectator against a solid brown background. Most American collectors, though, preferred their France with frills. The Alabama socialite Eugenia Woodward Hitt, wife of a margarine heir, acquired two grand, musical paintings by the portraitist Francois-Hubert Drouais (1727-1775): a young aristocrat in a lace collar strumming a guitar, and a pair of silk-clad children playing with a dog and an instrument in a shadowy grove. Another prime Drouais portrait, of a pink-cheeked marquise in a richly embroidered dress, was snatched up by an Indiana industrialist and now belongs to Ball State University. Perhaps you see the irony. The Americans who bought these paintings were the beneficiaries of a French philosophical tradition that revered liberty and equality, but they expressed it by collecting the possessions of the class that went to the guillotine. By the late 19th century, American industrialists were kitting out their homes in New York or Baltimore with gilded armoires and Fragonard panels, eating off Sevres porcelain, and throwing Versailles-themed costume balls.

The same economic upheavals that brought wealth to a new American collecting class coursed through Paris in the mid-19th century, when the young Bazille arrived from Montpellier to train as a doctor. He was a product of the new bourgeoisie, and when he arrived he enrolled in a painting studio, met Monet, Renoir and Sisley, and gave up medicine for a new, antiacademic art. In 1870, France declared war on Prussia, Bazille enlisted, and by the end of the year he was killed, aged just 28.

The National Gallery's Bazille retrospective, seen last year at the Musee Fabre in Montpellier and the Musee d'Orsay in Paris, examines the seven-year career of this specter of modern French painting. He learned quickly from the realist examples of Courbet and Manet, and in a smoldering self-portrait from 1865 he paints himself looking over his shoulder, his white shirt sleeve and pinkish forehead rendered as flat, brushy expanses. That same summer, he went to Fontainebleau with his studio mate Monet, who injured his leg; Bazille's ""The Improvised Field Hospital"" pictures that friend and rival in his sickbed, painted with brash wet-on-wet strokes.

Cunning pairings of Bazille's work with that of his friends not only clarifies his achievement but maps his social world. Monet's large ""Women in the Garden,"" an early endeavor in plein-air group portraiture, hangs beside Bazille's ""Family Gathering,"" a stiffer showcase of bourgeois leisure and light effects. A gray still life of a dead, trussed heron is paired with a painting of the same bird by Sisley, as well as a portrait by Renoir of Bazille at work on his avian death fugue. The whole crew gets together in Bazille's ""Studio on the Rue La Condamine,"" joined by the slightly older Manet -- who finished Bazille's work by painting in the younger man himself.",Early Americans subscribed to liberté and égalité — but they collected the paintings of the class that went to the guillotine.,4b5d218e-d3df-5ccc-a510-4c504f6e03fb,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/16/arts/16GALLERY/16GALLERY-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=3a3b75cb26a6ee7f9b720e948279a40266fe5971bb04b7ee2dc95c2e914166ba&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""Le Discret,"" Joseph Ducreux's circa 1791 selfie.",4b5d218e-d3df-5ccc-a510-4c504f6e03fb,N24News/imgs/4b5d218e-d3df-5ccc-a510-4c504f6e03fb.jpg,14
Real Estate,Winning the Housing Lottery,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/realestate/winning-the-housing-lottery.html,"When Rebekah Miranda and her daughter Amber Valentin moved into a brand-new apartment last September, it was a first for both of them. Ms. Miranda, 45, had lived in the same three-bedroom in the Morrisania neighborhood of the Bronx since she was a year old, and she had raised her four daughters there. Ms. Valentin, 18, her youngest, had lived there her entire life. Certainly, it wasn't love for their old place that had kept them there so long. The apartment, located in Forest Houses, a New York City Housing Authority project, was in constant disrepair, and Ms. Miranda, a 911 dispatcher, often returned from work at odd hours to find strangers hanging out in the building. ""I'd come home and there would be people in the lobby that didn't even live there,"" said Ms. Miranda, who was also unhappy about the condition of the building. ""It was just continuous repairs being done year after year -- roof leaking, paint peeling. I got tired of it,"" she said. ""I was embarrassed to have people over with all the repairs needing to be done in the kitchen and bathroom.""

Her parents had left years earlier when they bought a condo nearby, and her siblings had moved to other neighborhoods and cities as well. But Ms. Miranda never felt she could risk going herself. In the projects, rent was tied to income, so if her hours were cut or she lost her job, she wouldn't lose her home. Her caution seemed prudent when FEGS, the social-service nonprofit where she'd been a program assistant for years, declared bankruptcy in 2015 and she lost her job. By then, two of her daughters had left home, but Amber and another daughter who was completing a master's degree in social work were still living with her.

""To risk making less and not being able to make rent scared me,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""I didn't want to take chances."" A few years ago, however, a friend who'd found an affordable apartment through a housing lottery urged her to do the same. ""I started applying for every lottery in the Bronx,"" said Ms. Miranda, who didn't want to work too far from the borough's dispatch center near Pelham Bay. She was contacted about several units, but was twice denied because the overtime she worked had pushed her above the income cap.

Finally, she got a call about a two-bedroom at St. Augustine Terrace, a new 12-story building on the site of an old Catholic Church on East 167th Street. This one she qualified for, and she and Ms. Valentin, who is now a student at the Borough of Manhattan Community College, moved in last fall, paying $1,066 a month. Occupation: Ms. Miranda is a 911 dispatcher. Ms. Valentin studies psychology at the Borough of Manhattan Community College.

St. Augustine Terrace: A third of its 112 affordable units are designated for adults with mental illness, who are served by the Beacon of Hope Division of Catholic Charities Community Services.

Ms. Valentin's sisters: They all live in the New York area, though only one remains in the Bronx. ""We all have a group text. We used to get together more when everyone lived closer,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""But they'll all come over for dinner.""

The electric bill: Ms. Miranda at first worried about the cost, because she had never been responsible for electricity. ""But because we get so much natural light, Con Ed doesn't need to be on much.""

Large windows in the apartments and common spaces are among the most distinctive features of the building, which was designed for Affiliates of Catholic Charities by Magnusson Architecture and Planning. The firm included floor-to-ceiling windows in the expansive elevator lobbies on every floor, taking advantage of the fact that in an affordable-housing development, views didn't have to be reserved for the most expensive apartments. ""The windows caught my eye automatically when I walked in,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""They're huge. You can sit on the windowsill and look out when it rains. It's gorgeous.""

The building sits atop a rocky hill and is surrounded by a landscaped garden. ""The view from the top is amazing,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""When you come out of the elevator, it's all windows. On the Fourth of July we went up to the top floor to watch the fireworks."" Ms. Valentin and Ms. Miranda say they are surprised by how quiet it is in their first-floor apartment. ""We thought being on the first floor, the noise would be crazy,"" Ms. Miranda said. ""It's super quiet. Even on the hottest days this year we didn't hear much."" Except for the hardwood floors, that is. Never having lived in a new building before, the women didn't realize that new wood floors settle. ""It would suddenly sound like someone was walking in the living room at night and scare us,"" Ms. Miranda said.",A mother and daughter move from the Bronx housing project where they've lived all their lives to a brand-new apartment nearby.,161f3301-961f-5e7b-a1f6-66b6a740afe1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/22/realestate/16renters1/16renters1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=61a5841c72c0513cc452d38ff27a90ec1e4e93c73b6bccbd5b3ae0e558b620de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rebekah Miranda and her daughter, Amber Valentin, moved into a two-bedroom apartment in a new building in Morrisania last fall.",161f3301-961f-5e7b-a1f6-66b6a740afe1,N24News/imgs/161f3301-961f-5e7b-a1f6-66b6a740afe1.jpg,7
Television,"Review: In 'Bobby Kennedy for President,' a Don Draper of Politics",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/26/arts/television/review-bobby-kennedy-for-president-netflix.html,"""Bobby Kennedy for President,"" a four-part documentary coming out shortly before the 50th anniversary of Robert F. Kennedy's assassination, sounds like a departure for Netflix. The streaming service's lineup of original documentary series has been dominated by variations on true crime, with the occasional side trip into environmental scandal or cooking. A comprehensive survey of a major historical figure would be something new.

So maybe it's not surprising that the series, directed by Dawn Porter (""Trapped,"" ""Spies of Mississippi"") and available on Friday, is an odd hybrid -- a conventional, public-television-style biographical documentary that veers, in its fourth hour, into the sort of true-crime investigation Netflix is known for. Then at the last minute it swerves again, with a jarringly sentimental reunion and visit to the scene of the killing that's straight out of the feel-good branch of reality TV.

Throughout, ""Bobby Kennedy for President"" provides information and sometimes fascinating film clips without ever giving us much of a sense of its subject, who remains a Don Draper-like cipher. Outside of the third hour, which covers the 1968 presidential campaign, he's a supporting player in the dramas of other people: his brother John, Joseph McCarthy, George Wallace, Martin Luther King Jr., Lyndon Johnson. The series often looks like a general social and political history of the 1960s that's only loosely tied to Kennedy.

He even gets elbowed aside by the former colleagues, friends and aides who make up the show's relatively small stable of interview subjects. Activists like the congressman John Lewis, Marian Wright Edelman and Dolores Huerta relate their experiences with Kennedy while we see them with him in the archival photos and film, looking like their glamorous younger selves. Paul Schrade, an adviser to Kennedy on labor affairs who was wounded during the assassination, becomes the centerpiece of the fourth episode because of his decades-long effort to prove that a second shooter, not Sirhan Sirhan, killed Kennedy.","A four-part Netflix documentary series recounts a swath of 1960s social and political history, but the man at its center remains elusive.",e5a53930-8818-5aa6-b2b8-a49715e52578,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/28/arts/28rfk/27rfk-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d0cfda8ec3bb114848672474767af909a1947cd003c489da5ffdb4986f6150c7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert F.

Education,Income-Based Diversity Lags at Some Universities,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/education/college-slots-for-poorer-students-still-limited.html,"Opponents of race-based affirmative action in college admissions urge that colleges use a different tool to encourage diversity: giving a leg up to poor students. But many educators see real limits to how eager colleges are to enroll more poor students, no matter how qualified -- and the reason is money. ""It's expensive,"" said Donald E. Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University. ""You have to go out and identify them, recruit them and get them to apply, and then it's really expensive once they enroll because they need more financial aid."" The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a closely watched case over admissions at the University of Texas at Austin, and the court could outlaw any consideration of race. Opponents of affirmative action welcome that prospect, arguing that race-conscious admissions favor minority applicants who are not disadvantaged, and people on both sides of the issue contend that colleges should do more to achieve socioeconomic diversity. Polls show that while most Americans oppose racial or ethnic preferences in college admissions, they also think colleges should give extra help to the poor.

Some states have already banned affirmative action, including California, Florida, Michigan and Washington, and in each of them, the selective public universities stepped up their efforts to recruit disadvantaged students, hoping to enroll more black, Hispanic and American Indian students in the process. Opponents of race-conscious admissions say they expect similar moves across the country if the Supreme Court strikes down affirmative action. But even in those race-blind states, highly selective public colleges vary widely in how hard they work to identify high-achieving, disadvantaged students and prepare them for college, how heavily they weight disadvantage in admissions, and how generous they are with financial aid. Not surprisingly, they also differ greatly in how many disadvantaged students they enroll -- and the same is true among elite public and private schools that still do consider race and ethnicity.

But in the University of California system, one of the most competitive in the country, more than 40 percent of students were Pell recipients, including 34 percent at Berkeley and 36 percent at Los Angeles, the two most selective campuses in the system. At the University of Michigan, which is similar in selectivity and prestige, and also operates under a ban on considering race, only 16 percent of undergraduates received Pell Grants. So what accounts for the difference in the number of poor students enrolled in two similar elite public university systems, California's and Michigan's? Experts say that the level of state budget support, the intensity of recruitment efforts and other admissions decisions like legacy admissions are all factors. One crucial factor is outreach programs, starting as early as the middle school years. Studies show that large numbers of talented low-income students are ill-prepared for college, or never apply to selective schools, as though those colleges and the students were invisible to each other. California voters were the first to outlaw affirmative action, passing Proposition 209 in 1996, and in the following years, the University of California system expanded an already-robust set of programs to identify and nurture promising low-income students. ""Nobody else has had anything comparable,"" except, at times, the University of Washington, said Deirdre Bowen, a law professor at the Seattle University who has written extensively on affirmative action. ""But it matters much more at highly selective places like Michigan and Virginia."" Nancy Cantor, chancellor of Syracuse University and a former provost at Michigan, declined to comment on any particular school's efforts, but said, ""There's no question that some institutions have done a better job than others of building relationships in disadvantaged communities, which takes years.""

""The university is strongly committed to diversity of all kinds in the student body, including socioeconomic diversity,"" the university said, adding that the proportion of students at Michigan from low-income families has grown significantly in the last decade. ""We are moving in the right direction."" Another measure that increases the enrollment of disadvantaged students is accepting all top students from every high school, ensuring that low-income communities are well-represented. In areas with highly segregated schools, that has increased black and Latino enrollment in state universities. Texas, Florida and California have used this approach to varying degrees since they were barred from considering race; Michigan, like the elite schools that still have race-conscious admissions, has not. Legacy admission -- the practice of giving preference to the children of alumni or donors -- overwhelmingly favors well-off, white students, leaving less room for poor students. Some schools, after dropping affirmative action for ethnic minorities, also dropped legacy preferences, notably Texas A&M and the University of Georgia. But Michigan's legacy program continues. Public universities, in particular, caution that differences in low-income enrollment can reflect factors they have little control over, like the relatively low poverty rate in Virginia, or the level of help they get from state governments. States vary widely in direct support for their universities, and in the financial aid they provide; by both measures, Michigan ranks near the bottom, a fact that the university cited in discussing its low number of disadvantaged students. State universities affect their socioeconomic mix by deciding how often to admit out-of-state students, who pay much higher tuition, and are less likely to be poor -- important considerations in an era of dwindling state support. Elite schools with national reputations could easily fill most of their seats from beyond their borders, but some choose to rely more heavily on that pool than others. Among U.S.-resident undergraduates, out-of-staters account for 11 percent at Berkeley, and 34 percent at Michigan. An elite university's openness to accepting transfers from other schools also influences its economic diversity, because many transfer applicants start at community colleges or other, less prestigious public colleges, where low-income students are more prevalent.","Because of the high cost, some colleges do a lot more than others to find and enroll low-income students, which critics of race-based affirmative action see as a way to encourage diversity.",61f59e23-f1c3-524c-8c86-63bcb2ba9313,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/05/31/us/AFFIRM-2/AFFIRM-2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=384&w=600&s=e83aed3f09eec055bd485a5c97f3ee905fb5b597c12f343a92558591bd727927&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Literature given out at a Pico Rivera, Calif., high school as part of an outreach program aimed at low-income students.",61f59e23-f1c3-524c-8c86-63bcb2ba9313,N24News/imgs/61f59e23-f1c3-524c-8c86-63bcb2ba9313.jpg,22
Television,"My Screens Are Filled With Black Death, but I Won't Look Away",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/02/arts/television/the-boys.html,"This essay includes spoilers from the current season of ""The Boys."" The most recent episode of Amazon's superhero spoof ""The Boys"" opens with a gun-toting white man killing a South Asian storekeeper while hateful rhetoric about dangerous illegal immigrants runs through his head. Later at a public rally, two heroes decry ""godless, inhuman supervillains"" who are ""pouring across our borders"" while standing in front of a giant American flag. And to think that when I watched the episode screener recently, I had turned to it for a break from news stories about senseless murders of people of color and the poisonous, racist discourse that's become the norm in my supposedly great country. But this season of the series delivers more of the same: I was asked to watch more Black men die. The show's fictional renderings of Black deaths pale in comparison to the real tragedies they mirror. But I found their effect to be similarly distressing, and the presentations of both raise ethical questions about how we convey the horrors of America. When is this documenting of wrongs, as art or as journalism, a worthwhile public service intended to awaken people to what's happening in their country? And when is it simply exploiting tragedy for the sake of spectacle? Adapted from Garth Ennis's notoriously graphic comic book of the same name, ""The Boys"" has never been light viewing. But it has a dark sense of humor, and the explicit violence has a point, as part of a larger critique of capitalism, consumerism, jingoism and the American obsession with celebrity. In the show's alternative version of the world, superheroes are everywhere, and the best -- an adored group called the Seven -- are backed by an evil corporation, Vought International.

The second season narrows its gaze to focus on a timely topic: the power of hateful, fear-mongering political rhetoric. To that end, the show introduces a brand-new member of the Seven: Stormfront, an ageless wonder, played by Aya Cash, who we discover fought previously under the nom de guerre Liberty and was a member of the Nazi elite during World War II. The Stormfront of the comic is a savage Nazi man in a cape, a fierce, powerful hero who openly terrorizes people of color. The series switches the gender and makes the unveiling of her villainy more subtle: She is a white feminist who challenges sexist double standards but then mobilizes her fans, first via social media and then at raucous rallies, manipulating people's fears to her advantage. Her bigotry is revealed gradually, but as we see in flashbacks from when she was Liberty, it runs deep. In one triggering scene set in the '70s, Liberty stops a Black man and his younger sister as they're driving along at night. The superhero cites a car robbery, though the man insists the car is his. Nevertheless, Liberty kills the man as his sister watches.

In the present day, as Stormfront, she chases a superpowered character into an apartment complex full of Black families, thoughtlessly killing bystanders along the way. She flings a Black man against his own refrigerator and he dies in his home, and it's implied that the rest of his family does, too. She tosses another out of a window as if he were a piece of trash. When she reaches her target, an Asian man, she kills him slowly, cruelly, spitting out a racial epithet as she does. Later, at a rally, we see her proclaiming the need to ""Keep America safe again,"" in an explicit callback to our president's favorite catchphrase. Then there's that opening scene of the episode released on Friday, when a random white Stormfront fan, infected by her rabble-rousing racism, shoots the man at his own convenience store, afraid that he is one of the immigrant superterrorists he has been warned about. This scene and others like it this season are more vicious and urgent in their satire than what we've generally seen from ""The Boys,"" which primarily parodied celebrity culture and comic book cliches in Season 1. These calls are coming from inside the house. At least they feel that way to me, as a Black viewer. From its first episode, ""The Boys"" has proved that it won't shrink away from garish displays of blood and dismembering and otherwise gratuitous content, from its depictions of sexual assault to its alternative version of 9/11. In terms of pure violence, the scenes leading up to the revelation that Stormfront is the racist Liberty are generally in line with the show's more wanton action. But they build to something worthwhile, illuminating how hate can disguise itself, how it can be weaponized, how it can be inextricably woven into the fabric of a nation.

In that way, it's not much different from the videos we see constantly on news sites and telecasts and social media. Of Jacob Blake, shot and left paralyzed in Kenosha, Wis., in late August. Of George Floyd, who died with his head pressed to the ground, pinned beneath the knee of a police officer, in late May. Of all the Black people we've seen before and since. That night I watched ""The Boys,"" I also watched an NBC News collection from 2016 that packaged multiple police brutality videos together. One ran into another into another as I squinted at the screen, trying to make out what was happening in the muffled exchanges between blurry bodies. I felt a low, constant sense of suspense -- not the electric feeling of anticipating the drop of a roller coaster but the more everyday anxiety of, say, watching a pot on the stove, hoping your roiling, bubbling sauce won't spill over. The almost banal sense of fear that comes with being Black in America. Watching ""The Boys"" put me on edge, but to some extent I could shake off the anxiety. The acting, the camerawork, the artistic sheen of the series rendered these Black deaths visually indelible, but those elements also signaled the artifice of those scenes. I can still conjure them clearly in my mind, in part because of the cinematic choreography that went into creating a more stylized version of reality.

My reaction to the videos of Black deaths, however, was the inverse; I don't remember the specifics of the scenes, but the sinking feeling remains. There was the subtle kick of adrenaline that quickened the tempo of my heart and set the engine of my imagination going, churning out scenarios in which I was stopped in the street or shot in my home. I considered my overwhelmingly white Brooklyn neighborhood and tried to recall how many Black people I had seen that day, wondering if they at any point felt targeted, if they were also sitting fearful and panicked in their homes. And yet we're so quick to share these videos and to comment. The media is quick to replay the murders in the interest of documenting the news. They appear on TV and they autoplay in news articles and social media feeds, accompanied by an obligatory trigger warning, as though that excused what is sometimes a mere commodification of horror. In pursuing a salient truth about our nation, there is danger of reducing these videos into spectacles: performances, strung together, divorced from the concrete reality of the situation.

There is by now so much footage of Black deaths, so many videos, that the details have become blurry to me. Who reached for something? Who had hands in their pockets? Who gestured? Who slowly stepped forward? Who raised their arms into the air? The particulars are inconsequential -- or dangerous to the extent that they're used to explain away brutality, as though the victims were somehow at fault in their own executions. And yet they remind us that these were specific people killed within specific circumstances, not just names on a list or symbols of a movement. We call out, ""Say their names,"" but doing so can become more reflexive than reflective. Having watched deaths both fictional and real that night, I was exhausted, no longer sure which were exposing a continuing national tragedy and which were exploiting it. That line is hazy and shifts from person to person, and perhaps from night to night. But I'll keep watching. Occasionally we need to pay the price of our contentment, with fiction that expands our understanding of racial injustice in America and with the firsthand videos that bear witness to it. Both may miss the mark at times, when they fail to consider the dignity of the victims as carefully as they do their own narratives or ratings. But we can't afford to look away.","Scenes of racist brutality both real, in news videos, and imagined, in series like ""The Boys,"" can veer between exposure and exploitation.

Science,Hidden Kingdoms of the Ancient Maya Revealed in a 3-D Laser Map,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/27/science/maya-ruins-lidar.html,"Hidden pyramids and massive fortresses in the jungle. Farms and canals scattered across swamplands. Highways traversing thickets of rain forest. These are among more than 61,000 ancient Mayan structures swallowed by overgrowth in the tropical lowlands of Guatemala that archaeologists have finally uncovered using a laser mapping technology called lidar.

The discoveries, published Thursday in Science, provide a snapshot of how the ancient Maya altered the landscape around them for more than 2,500 years from about 1000 B.C. to 1500 A.D., and may change what archaeologists thought they knew about aspects of the ancient society's population size, agricultural practices and conflicts between warring dynasties.

The ancient Maya flourished in what is today southern Mexico, Guatemala, Belize and western Honduras. They left behind a rich written history painted and inscribed on wood, stone and ceramics. Detailed in their intricate hieroglyphics were tales of kings, queens and war.

""You're looking at a series of kingdoms all involved in this 'Game of Thrones' political story where they are marrying, fighting, killing each other and backstabbing,"" said Thomas Garrison, an archaeologist at Ithaca College and an author of the paper.

Television,"'Mr. Robot' Season 4, Episode 4 Recap: Into the Woods",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/27/arts/television/mr-robot-recap.html,"Agent Dom DiPierro is having a nightmare before Christmas. Forced to become a double agent against her own government by the Dark Army, which has threatened to torture her mother to death if she rebels, Dom returns to a pastime we've seen her indulge in long before that sinister hacker collective got its hooks in her: joylessly masturbating by the glow of her laptop. When interrogation-room footage of her one-time quarry Darlene Alderson no longer does the trick, she launches a chat with an ostentatiously male-seeming anonymous partner -- since she is gay, this is a clear sign she's searching for any port in a storm. It is Christmas Eve, after all, and any balm against loneliness will do. So she's surprised, and borderline delighted, when her mystery chat partner reveals she is actually a woman who gets off on playacting as a man. By then, this stranger has already asked to meet her in the flesh and make good on all their dirty talk; now that Dom knows she's a woman, she is prepared to take her up on the offer. Things are going pretty hot and heavy when Dom excuses herself to use the bathroom. But when she steps inside, she finds the bath drawn and every surface covered with candles and rose petals. It would be romantic ... if it weren't for the fact that someone had to break into her apartment to do it. Suddenly her one-night stand appears behind her, wearing the distinctive demon mask of the Dark Army. The demon attacks, plunging Dom into the water of the bath and holding her under. Everything will be much easier, says the attacker, if Dom stops fighting: ""Realize you'll never be free.""

Then she wakes up, in bed, laptop across her stomach. Her anonymous partner gave up and logged out hours ago. It was all a bad dream, except for the part about being under the thumb of a horde of vicious killers. That's all too real. Even apart from Dom's actual nightmare, this episode of ""Mr. Robot"" leaps deftly back and forth over the line of dream logic. Its efforts are aided by the late Christmas Eve setting -- the small hours after midnight when the world seems fast asleep, clearing the way for a sleigh drawn by magical reindeer. The only deer we see in this episode, however, is roadkill. While Dom dreams her uneasy dreams, Darlene embarks on a quest to meet up with her brother Elliot, who has fled the city after being followed to his apartment by the Dark Army. She has important information to give him about the next step in destroying the Deus Group, the top-secret organization of power brokers led by the Dark Army's commander, Whiterose. But because Elliot has been so cruel to her lately, she would almost rather not speak to him again. Her companion on her journey is an extraordinarily drunk man named Tobias who catches her trying to hot-wire his car. (At least, he thinks it's his car until he realizes hours later that it isn't. Like I said, he is extraordinarily drunk.) Tobias's distinguishing characteristic, aside from inebriation, is his disheveled Santa costume, which he wears to cheer up children in Sloan Kettering's pediatric cancer ward. He says he drinks to numb the pain of encountering so many smiling children he knows won't make it through. By the time they arrive at Tobias's house -- Darlene agrees to give him a lift home in exchange for ""borrowing"" the car -- Darlene is concerned that Tobias might take his own life. It's all a big misunderstanding, as Darlene misinterprets various innocuous statements made by Tobias -- a reference to ""It's a Wonderful Life,"" a Steinbeck quote -- as cries for help.

But by now, Tobias is sober enough to realize it is Darlene who really needs help. Surrounded by Christmas decorations, she pours her heart out, explaining how nearly everyone she has ever been close to is dead -- except for Elliot, who she is worried may be next. Tobias reassures her. S ometimes, a pep talk from Santa is just what the doctor ordered. Unfortunately, Darlene is right to worry about her brother. Though he and Tyrell manage to get the drop on the operative who was following him, the operative is significantly less dead than they believed him to be. When they pull over at a remote service station to buy gasoline and a lighter to torch the body and the Dark Army van they stole, they emerge to discover that their victim has recovered and driven off, stranding them. What follows is the episode's most visually surreal story line, as Wellick, Elliot and Elliot's Mr. Robot persona wander through the woods in search of the closest town. It's a starkly lit journey with the bright moonlight casting shadows and reflecting off the snow. In a smart bit of staging, the three men are nearly always shown marching from the right side of the screen to the left -- forcing the viewer's eye to reverse its normal left-to-right movement and almost subliminally making the trek seem more arduous. Haunted by the belief that they're marching to their doom and by the strange howl of a distant, unidentified animal, they eventually find a road -- and a dead deer, killed by the Dark Army agent's van before it crashed several yards away. Elliot and Wellick approach the van from different angles when suddenly the operative opens fire, mortally wounding Wellick before killing himself. Wellick spent their time in the woods bemoaning the fact that Elliot didn't care about him. But in the end, it is he who must insist that Elliot leave him behind in order to save himself, something Elliot refuses to do until Wellick insists. Wandering back into the woods to die, Wellick appears to find the source of the strange animal sounds: an unseen object emitting a cold blue light. As Wellick gazes in wonder, the screen fades to white. Arguably the strangest, most volatile character on ""Mr. Robot"" is given a moment of beauty and grace before dying, at the end of one of the show's strangest and most deeply empathetic episodes.
* None Wellick theorizes that Elliot wears the same clothes all the time -- black hoodie, black jeans, black shoes -- because he just doesn't care what anyone else thinks of him and perhaps doesn't care about anyone either. Speaking as a person who also wears a black hoodie, black jeans and black shoes all the time, I feel called out.
* None When Wellick is recognized by the clerk at the gas station, he attempts to obscure his identity -- he is one of the most famous men in the world -- by agreeing to her initial guess that he was a contestant on ""Big Brother."" Of course that's the reality show ""Mr. Robot"" would reference.
* None Since this may be the last chance to do so, I'd like to praise Martin Wallstrom's performance as Wellick. Though he was once styled as an ""American Psycho"" type, there turned out to be a great well of need beneath his sociopathic surface. Wallstrom's eyes have seemed to be on the verge of tears since late in the first season; he deserves kudos for acting on the edge.
* None The business Darlene says Elliot needs to infiltrate in order to take down the Deus Group: Virtual Realty.

For one thing, there's not a lot of tempting fresh produce in the market, inspiring a cook to make stunning salads. Then, there's the icy, gray-skied weather that quite naturally makes a body crave carb-heavy, cozy fare, preferably smothered in bacon and cheese.

The best January dishes bridge the divide between healthful and heavy. They're warming and sustaining, but still full of vegetables and whole grains.

Dance,The Magical Transformations of 'The Winter's Tale',https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/arts/dance/christopher-wheeldon-brings-statues-to-life-in-the-winters-tale-ballet-lincoln-center-festival-national-ballet-of-canada.html,"""The Winter's Tale,"" one of Shakespeare's final works, is an odd play: a devastating portrait of jealousy that ends in redemption, and a changeling's tale that moves from joy to tragedy and back again. Over the course of its five acts, oracles are ignored and then fulfilled; a man is mauled by a bear; and a statue comes to life.

Not an obvious choice for a new ballet. But then again, epic emotions and magical goings-on are not so rare in dance. Perhaps this affinity for magic is what persuaded Christopher Wheeldon that it might be worth a try. His three-act version, created for the Royal Ballet in 2014 as a co-production with the National Ballet of Canada, is being brought to New York by that Canadian company as part of the Lincoln Center Festival.

[ Alastair Macaulay's review of the National Ballet of Canada's performance in January ]

Mr. Wheeldon's adaptation involved some serious pruning, yet it hews surprisingly close to the play's themes. Strangely enough, the translation from words to movement has made tricky passages easier to swallow, particularly the magical ending.

As the ballet opens, we see a prologue in which two young princes, Polixenes of Bohemia and Leontes of Sicilia, play together. Soon, they are replaced by their older selves, now kings of their countries. One of them (Leontes) meets a girl (Hermione); they get married. All this takes less than a minute.

Media,Wall Street Journal Scrutinizes Hundreds of Articles by Fired Reporter,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/business/media/jay-solomon-wall-street-journal.html,"The Wall Street Journal is conducting a review of hundreds of articles by Jay Solomon, who was the paper's chief foreign affairs correspondent. He was fired on Wednesday after evidence emerged that he had possibly become entangled in the commercial dealings of an Iranian-born aviation titan who was a key source for some of his stories.

Karen Miller Pensiero, who oversees newsroom standards, is leading the review.

It is part of The Journal's response to an article published by The Associated Press on Wednesday that described communications between Mr. Solomon and the businessman, Farhad Azima, about a possible business venture involving aerial espionage in Iran and a $725 million defense-related contract with the United Arab Emirates.

The Associated Press contacted the newspaper on Monday about documents that appeared to connect Mr. Solomon and Mr. Azima. That day, Paul Beckett, The Journal's Washington bureau chief, was summoned to the company's New York headquarters, where he met with top editors on Tuesday about The A.P.'s impending story.

Early Wednesday, employees in The Journal's D.C. bureau sensed that Mr. Solomon, 49, was in some trouble. Around 3 p.m. Mr. Beckett sent an email calling for a staff meeting. The meeting was brief. Mr. Beckett told the employees that he wanted them to hear from him that Mr. Solomon had been fired and that The A.P. was going to publish a story that would raise some questions about him.","The Journal fired Jay Solomon, the paper's chief foreign affairs correspondent, after being shown evidence of a possible business entanglement with a key source.",03a9966e-c206-574f-b107-df418e96d0c7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/23/business/23SOLOMON1/23SOLOMON1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=15d3ebb9b3dc704375b3721ffe3e5cf0cdd176dfb4c1ae38330dc9931829673a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jay Solomon, a Wall Street Journal correspondent who was fired on Wednesday, appearing on C-Span in 2014.",03a9966e-c206-574f-b107-df418e96d0c7,N24News/imgs/03a9966e-c206-574f-b107-df418e96d0c7.jpg,16
Television,"On That 'Barry' Finale and Why Some Shows Are So Good, They Need to End",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/13/arts/television/barry-finale-hbo-bill-hader.html,"On That 'Barry' Finale and Why Some Shows Are So Good, They Need to End

The end of the first season of ""Barry"" was so good it made me never want to watch the show again. Over the course of HBO's dark comedy -- beat it if you don't want to know what happened -- Barry (Bill Hader), a hit man in Los Angeles, fell out of love with his profession and in love with a woman from his acting class, who was unaware of his day job. By the last episode, which aired Sunday night, he'd won her over and sworn off murder -- or so he told himself until, on a weekend getaway, he was confronted by a police detective who connected him with his crimes. Trapped, he apparently swallowed his qualms and killed her. In the final scene, he crawled into bed next to his girlfriend, grimaced and said to himself: ""Starting n--"" Cut to black. It was an excellent season finale. But it would have been one hell of a gutsy series finale. That uncompleted syllable would have suggested so much: Barry's ultimate inability to change, a series of self-deceptions and one last times stretching on forever. It was such an effective ending, in fact, that before I wrote my review I had to check to make sure that ""Barry"" was not a limited-run mini-series. It is not; HBO has since picked it up for another season.

At the same time, this doesn't feel like a series that should stretch on more than a few seasons. ""Barry"" commits to a bold premise, but could you sustain it for six years, seven, more? Either Barry is capable of change or he's not. If he is, that seems like material for one more very good season or two. If he's not, and the series brings him back into the criminal life, then the character's drive (you, and Barry, want him to redeem himself) is at odds with the needs of the plot (you, and the network, want the story to keep going). I get this feeling more and more often lately, as with Season 2 of ""The Handmaid's Tale."" I like what I've seen so far (about half the season). Expanding the story past the end of Margaret Atwood's novel expands the world fruitfully, filling in the details of its patriarchal dictatorship and exploring how all the parts of a system of oppression work.

But there's a hitch. June (Elisabeth Moss) ended the first season as she ended the novel, headed either for rescue or punishment. The series decided to make it both: First, she was brought to a horrific mock execution, then was liberated by the resistance, then was recaptured. There is only so long, in a series about bondage and rape, that you can string out the cycle of raising and dashing hopes without numbing or traumatizing your audience. Wanting a good series not to last too long is a high-class problem, and a fairly recent one. In the early decades of TV, series were endless, until they ended. This was fine, since most shows essentially returned every episode to the status quo ante. (Or, in the case of a soap like ""Dallas,"" the absurdity of endless plot twists was taken for granted.) A story might get tired but it wouldn't really get old, because TV took place in a time warp where time didn't pass. In the cable era, TV got more ambitious and more serial. Things changed by the end of an episode. Characters would be in very different circumstances a few years after we met them. Once TV was telling stories that changed, it suggested that the stories needed to end, properly, rather than just stop.

So David Chase ended ""The Sopranos"" when he was done with it, not necessarily when his viewers were. ""Lost"" set its ending date three seasons in advance. We now had the notion that a fresh TV idea, like fresh produce, had an expiration date. And when it passed that date -- whew, could you smell it. Take ""Dexter."" Like ""Barry,"" it was about a murderer for whom we had mixed sympathies (a serial killer who tried to follow a code to whack only deserving victims). The first season was excellent, and popular. So it had another, and another, and another, stringing itself out for eight seasons of implausible dilemmas until its final mercy-killing.

""The Office"" should have departed when Michael Scott did. You may be a bigger fan of the later seasons of ""Homeland"" than I am, but had it ended after its first, it would have been a legend. In part, this situation is the side effect of a good thing: With more TV outlets serving more-targeted audiences, a daring, unconventional show has a decent chance of surviving. With dozens of cable outlets and the seemingly bottomless pockets of Netflix and Amazon (soon to be joined by Apple), TV is becoming a ""more"" machine. TV series are becoming like athletes going on a season or three past when they should have retired. Netflix's ""American Vandal,"" for instance, was one of my favorite shows of 2017 -- an inventive, filthily funny story that ended with closure and didn't overstay its welcome. But Netflix is bringing it back for a second season, anyway. Ditto HBO's ""Big Little Lies,"" constructed elegantly around a finite story based on its source novel. I can't judge a season of TV that doesn't exist, of course. Both these second seasons might pleasantly surprise me the way ""Stranger Things 2"" did. But as a larger pattern, sequel-driven TV does not make me any more hopeful than sequel-driven movies.

This involves not just overextended series but the growing list of revivals. Seize the monkey's-paw remote control, and nothing ever needs to truly die. Wish there was more ""Arrested Development""? You got it! Ever wondered what Roseanne Conner's up to 20 years later? We'll tell you! (You may not like it!) All this has given me a strange appreciation for the disappointments of TV past. ""Freaks and Geeks"" broke my heart when it was canceled in 2000, and not a few times have I wondered whether, had it come along a dozen years later, it might have lasted for years. On the other hand, like most high school shows, it probably shouldn't have had more than three seasons or so. There's a reason we feel sad for the former prom king who keeps hanging around after graduation. I realize that complaining about too much of a good thing makes me sound like a crank. No one's forcing me to watch this revival or that sequel, to stick with a show that's lasted too long. But we lose something when we lose a sense of finality. It gives meaning to art the way that the knowledge of death gives meaning to life. When no ending is permanent -- even if it means resurrecting dead characters -- the power of endings is compromised. And often an ending that comes before we want it to comes exactly at the right time. So I hope the second season of ""Barry"" wows me as much as the first. But I also hope that, when it knows the time has come, it will not hesitate to pull the trigger.",Some fresh TV ideas have an expiration date.

Dance,Nuggets of Ballet Wisdom From Bodies Trained by Balanchine,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/13/arts/dance/balanchine-dances-taught-by-old-masters-patricia-mcbride.html,"Last week Megan Fairchild, a New York City Ballet principal, posted a photograph on Instagram of herself and Joaquin De Luz with Patricia McBride. ""What a pleasure and honor to work with this bright spirit on a ballet that is dear to our hearts!!!!,"" she wrote. ""Thanks Pattie for all your nuggets of wisdom! So wonderful to hear what she did in the role, and what Mr. B. asked her to do. We will cherish these last two days forever!!!!"" One of the hashtags is #baiserdelafee.

These happy words require a few layers of explanation for nonspecialists. They also open up one of the biggest issues around City Ballet today. ""Le Baiser de la Fee"" (""The Fairy's Kiss"") is a four-scene ballet composed by Igor Stravinsky in 1928. And ""Mr. B"" is the choreographer George Balanchine, who first staged ""Baiser"" in 1937. In 1972, he choreographed the score's dance suite, ""Divertimento From 'Le Baiser de la Fee,'"" for New York City Ballet; and in 1974 he added the finale from the complete ""Baiser."" This version had no scenery, no fairy and no kiss; it has remained in repertory ever since.

Balanchine made its lead roles for Ms. McBride and Helgi Tomasson, who danced them into the 1980s. Ms. Fairchild and Mr. De Luz, longtime City Ballet principals, have been dancing ""Divertimento From 'Le Baiser de la Fee'"" for a number of years. And here's the crucial issue: Why have even senior City Ballet dancers been deprived for so long of interpretive wisdom about this (and many other) Balanchine ballets? When Peter Martins was ballet master in chief (1983-2018), Ms. McBride was among the many creators of Balanchine roles who -- as if in exile -- were seldom if ever invited to coach their roles at City Ballet.

Mr. Martins retired under pressure on Jan. 1 after allegations of physical and sexual harassment. Over the decades, no single feature of his artistic policy has caused more grievance than this disinclination to bring in Balanchine alumni.","Patricia McBride, a New York City Ballet luminary, recently returned to the company to coach a Balanchine ballet she created in the 1970s.",394333c2-03bd-5eb6-a665-7f7e78304951,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/14/arts/14OLDMASTERS10/14OLDMASTERS10-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a2b3b75bab0536f35e7f1cf1a7bc2390c9c5f47d906f5f2a19c0db8aa9a7cb48&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Patricia McBride, right, rehearsing &ldquo;Swan Lake&rdquo; with the choreographer George Balanchine and Edward Villella in 1964.",394333c2-03bd-5eb6-a665-7f7e78304951,N24News/imgs/394333c2-03bd-5eb6-a665-7f7e78304951.jpg,6
Movies,F.A.A. Says Harrison Ford Can Continue Flying,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/24/movies/harrison-ford-cleared-faa.html,"LOS ANGELES -- The Federal Aviation Administration announced on Thursday that it had cleared Harrison Ford to continue flying, after the actor completed remedial training prompted by an incident in April when he had crossed a runway by accident. Mr. Ford's representatives said that on April 24, he had ""crossed the airport's only runway in his aircraft after he misheard a radio instruction"" from the control tower. ""He immediately acknowledged the mistake and apologized for the error,"" the representatives said in a statement. The agency said it closed the case after Mr. Ford, 78, completed ""a remedial runway incursion training course."" Under agency rules, Mr. Ford was allowed to keep piloting during the investigation; in August he flew his son Liam from California to Massachusetts for his return to Amherst College. A private pilot for more than 40 years, Mr. Ford has never been shy about admitting to errors. In February 2017, when he landed on a taxiway rather than the runway at John Wayne Airport in Santa Ana -- coming within 100 feet of a commercial airliner -- he immediately radioed the tower at the California airport and acknowledged he was responsible.

Mr. Ford was also cleared to fly by the agency in that episode. The approval came after some fairly grueling interviews in which Mr. Ford was reported to have been humble and contrite. He was required to complete an ""awareness training"" course. But that mistake, along with the one in April, when Mr. Ford crossed the runway at Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Los Angeles County despite having been told to ""hold short"" because of flight traffic, had some pilots wondering whether it was time to ground him. Though many pilots agree that some people lose proficiency and ""situational awareness"" as they fly in their mid-70s, a process that higher insurance rates for older pilots make plain, most experts suggest allowing people to fly must be done on a case-by-case basis. ""Just like in the world of automobiles, not every octogenarian or nonagenarian should be behind the yoke, much less near an airport,"" said Jeffrey Madison, the aviation safety columnist for General Aviation News. ""And just as in the world of automobiles, there are plenty of anecdotes of sharp-minded pilots flying proficiently and consistently well into their late 80s or 90s."" Mr. Ford is renowned as the intergalactic flyboy Han Solo and his celebrity inevitably entered the discussion of whether the F.A.A. has been rigorous in regulating his piloting. But Isabel Goyer, editor of Plane & Pilot, said she did not think that celebrity had gotten in the way.

""The F.A.A. did the right thing in this case,"" she wrote in an editorial. ""Some are going to act outraged that a movie star got special treatment, but I don't think that's what happened at all."" Ms. Goyer and others pointed out that Mr. Ford showed great skill in 2015 when a small plane he was piloting experienced engine failure, forcing him to make an emergency landing on a California golf course. Mr. Ford's pelvis and ankle were broken in the crash, but he kept others from being injured. In terms of age, Dr. James Yankaskas, 73, a physician at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill and a longtime pilot safety advocate, said pilots like Mr. Ford can retain great proficiency past 75. Still, he said, 75 is his own likely stopping point -- short of ""getting a partner or friend to fly with me, changing to radio controlled models, or hiring safety pilots."" Mr. Madison said he was not in position to judge Mr. Ford's proficiency, but he recalled an aviation adage: ""There are old pilots and there are bold pilots, but there are no old bold pilots.""","After the actor went through remedial training, the agency said it had closed its investigation into a runway error he was involved in last April.",df7cee41-18e7-52a9-b1ec-48d7510ad69c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/24/arts/24ford-item/merlin_172049340_30f79135-adbc-4ed7-ae9d-d61c9c4ae4d1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c366eca54f22b7f09acca7484ab637acc5c4799853d912203c8209d500c892ac&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Harrison Ford, who is renowned for his role as the intergalactic flyboy Han Solo and has been a private pilot for more than 40 years.",df7cee41-18e7-52a9-b1ec-48d7510ad69c,N24News/imgs/df7cee41-18e7-52a9-b1ec-48d7510ad69c.jpg,5
Music,Listening to the Throbbing of the Stars,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/17/arts/music/claude-vivier-review.html,"Since the composer Claude Vivier's death in 1983, at just 34, his work has hardly been obscure. His music, shimmering with the spacey solemnity of childhood games, was taken up by influential figures like the impresario Pierre Audi, the composer Gyorgy Ligeti and the conductor Reinbert de Leeuw. In 2005, the publisher Boosey & Hawkes began overseeing and promoting his scores.

[Read more about Vivier's ""death-obsessed search for connection.""]

Yet he remains a figure more referred to than heard in performance. So it still counts as news that two major Vivier pieces were played in New York on back-to-back evenings this week, Tuesday and Wednesday.

The juxtaposition was a coincidence -- given Vivier's celestial leanings, we might say the planets were in alignment -- but it was still a little landmark. ""Listen to the throbbing of the stars,"" the singers chant in his only opera, ""Kopernikus,"" which had its New York premiere at Issue Project Room in Brooklyn on Wednesday. We're listening, more and more.

Once you have that image in your mind, in fact, it can be hard to let it go: Vivier's music does often seem to evoke a starry throb. Close, mystical harmonies are tinged with microtonal dissonances that vibrate almost visibly. Waves of passion are cloaked in a shining, medieval purity -- and a use of babbling invented languages -- that feels otherworldly; the effect is simultaneously in and out of body.","Claude Vivier's celestial music is still more heard about than heard, but he was the focus of back-to-back performances in New York this week.",c86f6cde-3c07-5f8c-9774-f94876a13162,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/17/arts/17vivier-oak/17vivier-oak-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=abff9262485dde535f7c03f0095f314c71dcb9e0a0afd02157c91c40adb1df14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"For the New York premiere of Claude Vivier's opera ""Kopernikus,"" the audience faced projected video as Sebastián Zubieta conducted Meridionalis and the International Contemporary Ensemble.",c86f6cde-3c07-5f8c-9774-f94876a13162,N24News/imgs/c86f6cde-3c07-5f8c-9774-f94876a13162.jpg,12
Fashion & Style,On the Auction Block: The Pull of Celebrity,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/07/fashion/audrey-hepburn-mario-testino-auctions.html,"LONDON -- Must-see collections will not be limited to the runways of the four fashion capitals this fall. September will also play host to a trio of high-profile auctions that put the private artworks and personal possessions of three tastemakers with strong ties to the fashion world under the hammer. Sotheby's is set to hold two major sales: The first, in London on Sept. 13, will be composed of photographs, paintings and sculpture owned by the Peruvian fashion photographer Mario Testino, known for his Vogue covers and Princess Diana portraits. The second, on Sept. 27, will be held in New York and showcase contemporary art and design pieces that belonged to Santiago Gonzalez, who died earlier this year; he was the president and creative director of the Colombian accessories powerhouse Nancy Gonzalez. Also on Sept. 27, and back in London, Christie's will hold a sale of over 300 items owned by Audrey Hepburn, including wardrobe staples, film scripts and personal letters. An accompanying online auction will run from Sept 17. to Oct 3.

""More and more people like to see a sense of individual character coming through and to identify private passions from works,"" he said. ""In the iPhone era, we have all become collectors of images, in a way. And particularly with living creatives like Mario, the immediacy of access to his life and work appears to have made him even more covetable."" For Mr. Testino, the decision to put the items up for sale stemmed from a desire to generate fresh funding for his museum, Museo MATE, in Lima, Peru. Titled ""Shake It Up,"" the sale is of works he amassed over the past 30 years traveling the world for shoots. He began, he said, with a focus on early- and mid-20th-century photography; his appetite broadened along with his bank balance. ""The moment I made some money in the 1980s, I started collecting,"" Mr. Testino said. ""First it was vintage photography by some of my heroes. Then it evolved into contemporary photography, and then contemporary art. We are always changing, therefore what we want to live with must also change.""

Highlights include pieces by artists and photographers including Vanessa Beecroft, Olafur Eliasson, Nan Goldin, Florian Maier-Aichen, Richard Prince and Wolfgang Tillmans (some of the top lots are cited below). ""It was difficult to make the selection for the sale. I felt like I was seeing my children leave home,"" Mr. Testino said. ""Nearly all of these pieces I have lived with. But I still own work by nearly every artist in the auction. And when I made the choices I kept thinking that the more I put in, the more we'd be able to help people, children and artists in Peru."" For the family of Mr. Gonzalez, who died unexpectedly in March at the age of 40, the sale is bittersweet. Known within the fashion world as an avid art collector, he was, said Emily Kaplan, the head of Sotheby's Contemporary Curated department, ""a real Peter Pan-like figure."" This is illustrated by the pieces in ""Neither Appearance Nor Illusion: Property From the Collection of Santiago Barberi Gonzalez,"" part of the larger Contemporary Curated series that Sotheby's holds each year. The lot will feature 74 works by such names as Antony Gormley, Ed Ruscha, Claude Lalanne and Fernando and Humberto Campana, with an expected price range from about $250 to $400,000. ""I think the consensus was that we wanted everyone to have a chance to buy a piece of Santiago's collection,"" Ms. Kaplan said. ""He collected with an amazing amount of passion and knowledge, and the works reflect both the cerebral and playful sides of his much-missed personality."" Many of the pieces deal with the topic of displacement in space and time, she noted. But alongside those works are finger and nail objects, and charming little wooden crocodile toys, synonymous with Mr. Gonzalez's Colombian home.

""That he lived so vibrantly among all these works, and that he chose them personally, gives them a real power and presence,"" Ms. Kaplan said. The hope that prospective buyers will pay handsomely for the private props of a person's history is shared by the curators responsible for Christie's Audrey Hepburn sale. Ms. Hepburn died in 1993, and many of the pieces -- film scripts for ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" and ""Charade"" (personally annotated in turquoise ink), Valentino couture, an engraved gold cigarette lighter and instantly recognizable photographs by the likes of Cecil Beaton -- have never been available to the public before. ""There have been Audrey Hepburn sales in the past, but this is the first to have come directly from her family,"" said Adrian Hume-Sayer, Christie's director of private collections. Standout pieces from Ms. Hepburn's closet, he said, include the blue satin Givenchy cocktail dress she wore in a photograph promoting the 1967 film ""Two for the Road"" (estimate: $11,000 to $17,000); a long tan Burberry trench coat (estimate: $6,700 to $9,000); and her signature colorful ballet flats (estimate: $1,700).

""Unlike other stars of that era, Audrey's sense of style still feels very accessible and modern -- she is the definition of a timeless icon,"" Mr. Hume-Sayer said. ""And because she is still so beloved, and her look is still so ingrained in the public consciousness, her family were keen to make these particular pieces available to those who loved her. So many parts of her life are in this sale. It is a once-in-a-lifetime event.""

Health,Obamacare Turns 10. Here's a Look at What Works and Doesn't.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/health/obamacare-aca-coverage-cost-history.html,"With the coronavirus, a new Supreme Court case and a blistering election debate, the Affordable Care Act is facing challenges as never before. We looked at how it's held up to its promise.

A pandemic. A Supreme Court challenge (again). A presidential election campaign -- this time with attacks from the left as well as the right. Ever since President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law 10 years ago Monday, it has faced legislative, legal and political assaults. The landmark health law, nicknamed Obamacare, has withstood more than 60 votes to repeal it from Republican-controlled Congresses, two Supreme Court decisions, the gutting of one of its main provisions (the tax penalty for not having insurance) and a president who campaigned on promises to get rid of it. But for all the challenges the law has weathered, no moment has seemed as existential as now. As the coronavirus pandemic tests the American health system in ways few could have imagined, an increasingly conservative Supreme Court is preparing to hear another case, backed by the Trump administration, challenging the law's constitutionality. At the same time, the left wing of the Democratic Party, a major force behind the law's passage, has grown impatient with it and is demanding more radical change, to a single-payer, government-run health insurance system. On the anniversary of the law, veteran health policy reporters at The New York Times looked beyond the political and legal debate to try to answer one question: How has the law worked in its first decade?

Still, all but 14 states have now expanded the program, and the results have been significant: Medicaid enrollment increased by about 13 million, or 34 percent, in the so-called expansion states between 2013 and 2019, according to federal data. The uninsured rate for poor adult citizens with no dependent children -- a group that had often been ineligible for Medicaid -- plummeted, dropping to 16.5 percent in 2015 from 45.4 percent in 2013, according to the Urban Institute. Over all, the largest coverage gains under the A.C.A. have been among Hispanic, black and Asian patients -- many of the groups that had the highest uninsured rates before the law, the Kaiser Family Foundation found. For some, the coverage has changed their lives profoundly. Jean Jackson, 64, of Danville, Va., had to retire early from her job as a cooling inspector in 2017 because she had cataracts that made it impossible for her to drive at night, when her shift took place. That left her uninsured until January 2019, when Virginia expanded Medicaid. By then her cataracts had grown large enough to require surgery. She had them removed within months of getting Medicaid and now can again see well enough to drive after dark, allowing her to volunteer and attend community meetings, activities she said were vital to her well-being. ""It was stressful, yes it was,"" Ms. Jackson, who is black, said of not having health insurance. ""It was very frightening, not being able to see.""

The slippage has especially hurt children -- a recent analysis of new census data by The Times found that the number of children without insurance rose by more than 400,000 between 2016 and 2018. Now, as the coronavirus sweeps through the country, many state officials are relying on the Affordable Care Act to provide health coverage for residents who have none. On Friday, California became one of the latest states to set up a special enrollment period so people can sign up for insurance on their state-run marketplaces, and the Trump administration is considering reopening enrollment in the larger federal marketplace, which serves most states, for a limited period. For many Americans, the ""Affordable"" part of the Affordable Care Act has seemed like an empty promise, as premiums, deductibles and other out-of-pocket costs continue to be an extraordinary burden on millions of households. But the law has made health care far more affordable in a number of less conspicuous ways. For Marque Dailey of Dallas, 35, who has multiple sclerosis, the Affordable Care Act was the only way to get private insurance. Before the law, insurance companies were allowed to deny coverage to people like him who had expensive medical conditions, or to charge such a high price that many could not afford the premiums. About half of all Americans had such pre-existing conditions, including high blood pressure or lung disease, that resulted in their being denied or potentially priced out of coverage, according to one federal estimate. After the law passed forcing insurers to accept anyone without raising premiums, Mr. Dailey was able to enroll in a Blue Cross plan in Texas, which covered his medical care that at times approached $200,000 a year. His income was low enough that he also qualified for generous federal subsidies under the law that kept his monthly premiums at no more than $235, and his out-of-pocket costs capped at around $1,000 a year. The law has also played an important role in keeping care affordable for the 160 million Americans who get coverage from an employer, including by requiring those plans to cover the children of beneficiaries until age 26. Before the law, employer-provided plans often set strict limits on what they would pay toward medical bills during a single year and over a lifetime. An estimated 105 million Americans had some sort of lifetime cap before the passage of the health care law.

The second study used an even stronger methodology. Employees at the Treasury Department used tax records to identify Americans who were uninsured, then mailed a letter about health insurance options to a random sample of them. Researchers found less insurance and more deaths in the group that didn't get a letter. Because that study cut across every state, and because the experiment used a random method of selection, several scholars who had previously been unsure say they are now convinced that the law's expanded health insurance coverage is making a meaningful difference in physical health. The new mortality studies measure only death rates. They don't track the medical care or the health status of the people in the studies, so it's still unclear precisely how that health insurance matters. After all, even people without health insurance can go to an emergency room and receive treatment for their most acute problems. And existing networks of free and low-cost clinics have always helped some uninsured people get less urgent care. One theory is that health insurance makes it easier to get prescription drugs, particularly drugs shown to reduce deaths from cardiac problems. A study from Dr. Somers and his co-authors found that Medicaid expansion led to big increases in prescriptions for this class of drugs. Another theory is that, even though uninsured people can use the emergency room, insured people are still quicker to seek care there. The difference between waiting hours or days to seek care after showing signs of a heart attack or a stroke could be the difference between life and death. Jacob Goldin, an associate professor at Stanford, who was one of the authors of the Treasury paper, said he had been surprised by how quickly his paper showed changes from health insurance. They started being able to measure reductions in deaths after just one year, he said, a timeline that may be explained by the emergency room theory. The health care industry supported the law a decade ago because it offered them tens of millions more in paying customers. ""These guys supported the A.C.A. for very good and very self-interested reasons,"" said Dr. Len Nichols, a health policy professor at George Mason University.

In the early years though, it wasn't clear that the insurance market created under the law was going to work. Healthcare.gov, the federal online marketplace, got off to a shaky start, with technical issues keeping people from enrolling in plans. Insurers also had difficulty pricing their plans. After decades of carefully selecting whom they insured, insurers were forced to operate under the new requirement to offer anyone a policy, even if that person had a potentially expensive medical condition, without charging a much higher price. Many insurers suffered heavy losses at first. Some of the biggest players in health insurance abandoned the market. UnitedHealth Group, one of the nation's largest insurers, bowed out in 2016, citing losses of $1 billion. Lawmakers worried about so-called bare counties, places where insurers would simply refuse to offer coverage because there weren't enough customers or prices were too high to stay in business. But while the learning curve was steep, insurers discovered how to prosper. They raised premiums enough to make money and narrowed their networks of hospitals and doctors to reduce their costs. Insurers also latched on to the government's Medicaid program, which is run by private insurers in most states. ""The individual market remains profitable and stable,"" concluded a recent analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which tracked the financial performance of the insurers. Companies, which were once spending nearly every cent of each dollar they collected in premiums on medical claims, were now taking in enough money to have 25 cents left over in the most recent period of 2019. When the Affordable Care Act's architects think about what they wish they had done differently, they often focus on one issue: the deductibles. Most health insurance plans have deductibles, an amount that patients need to pay before coverage kicks in. The Affordable Care Act, however, allowed insurers to set deductibles significantly higher than those typically faced by Americans who get health insurance at work. Individual deductibles can go as high as $8,150. For families, the limit rises to $16,300. The White House and Congress wrote those amounts into the law when they drafted it in order to keep the law's overall price tag down. Looking back, they question that decision.

""Because of my experience of being uninsured, I know that my coverage has value even if I never use it,"" said Elizabeth Meyer, a contract lawyer in Chicago who has purchased health law coverage since the program began in 2014. ""At the same time, any health care I want is still me paying for it on my own."" Ms. Meyer currently buys a health plan with a $6,650 deductible. She says she now goes to the doctor less than when she was uninsured, because she can no longer ask for a discount her providers typically gave to patients lacking coverage. Jeremy Kridel, 43, lives in the Baltimore suburbs and buys coverage for his family through the health law marketplace. A federal subsidy brings the premium he pays down to $275 a month, but the plan's $13,000 family deductible means that the family frequently skips recommended care, including for his son who has autism. ""I feel guilty,"" Mr. Kridel, a rabbi, said. ""My wife has a lot of damage to cartilage in her knees, but goes as long as she can between sets of shots even when her knees hurt. We know we're just kicking the can down the road, but we couldn't afford surgery right now.""

Some of those who worked on the Affordable Care Act say they saw this issue coming, as they were writing the legislation. ""There was an acknowledgment at the time that affordability was likely going to be a concern,"" said Frederick Isai, who worked on the law as a congressional staffer in 2009 and 2010. He is now the executive director of the nonprofit Families USA, which advocates affordable health coverage. Some expected that the health law's subsidies would be enhanced over time, as legislators often return to make tweaks and adjustments to major legislation. Instead, Republican legislation focused primarily on attempting to repeal the health law and replace it with something else. The health law's architects say there is an easy way to address the health law's large deductibles: pass new legislation that puts more money toward subsidies. Right now, the Affordable Care Act offers premium subsidies to Americans who earn up to 400 percent of the poverty line, about $48,500 for an individual and $100,000 for a family of four. Subsidies for deductibles go up only to 250 percent of the poverty line, meaning that families like Mr. Kridel's are excluded. But more generous subsidies require more government spending at a time when deficits are already ballooning. So there's another, harder, way to fix the Affordable Care Act deductible problem: rein in America's high medical prices. If each doctor visit and hospital stay costs less, then insurers would be able to cover more without asking patients to pay a large share.","With the coronavirus, a new Supreme Court case and a blistering election debate, the Affordable Care Act is facing challenges as never before. We looked at how it's held up to its  promise.",6baee243-fce0-5f4d-8ce1-6c0f2d065f15,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/03/23/science/23ACA-DECADE1/23ACA-DECADE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e4a9703d627bd10c5956edd170555ad311e4014dbf8cc98c96809ffd7aa22b8b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President Obama signing the Affordable Care Act into law at the White House on March 23, 2010.",6baee243-fce0-5f4d-8ce1-6c0f2d065f15,N24News/imgs/6baee243-fce0-5f4d-8ce1-6c0f2d065f15.jpg,1
Television,The World Wants More Danish TV Than Denmark Can Handle,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/14/arts/television/denmark-netflix-labor-shortage.html,"A crew shooting a scene for ""Pros and Cons,"" one of the shows contributing to a boom in Danish-made television.





COPENHAGEN -- Merete Mortensen, the founder of a successful television production company here, is used to having her pick of the industry's top talent in Denmark. But when she was trying to hire a new developer this year to help her create new shows, her first and even second choice turned her down. She sweet-talked them with everything she could think of -- a larger salary, a longer contract, beers -- but with no luck. ""It's been crazy this year in Denmark,"" said Ms. Mortensen. ""We've been having bidding wars over the best people."" Netflix, Amazon Prime and their ever-growing number of competitors have dramatically reordered television, creating a boom in TV shows as well as jobs for actors, directors, producers and writers. A lot of that content is being developed far from the usual hubs in Hollywood, New York and London, as the streaming services mine international productions from countries including France, Japan and Brazil.

Perhaps nowhere is that expansion more evident than in Denmark, where thanks to years of rising demand, there are many more critically-praised series and movies being made than ever before. But what there isn't, in this country of just 5.6 million people, is enough skilled professionals to produce them all. Help-wanted ads are popping up all over industry Facebook groups. Certain shows have had to postpone production by six months, or indefinitely, said Claus Ladegaard, the director of the government-sponsored Danish Film Institute, which helps fund many productions here. There's a two-year wait for skilled line producers, who oversee productions, Mr. Ladegaard said, noting there is also a shortage of scriptwriters, cinematographers and directors. Both TV2, a public station, and the film institute recently called on the Danish Film School -- the country's only training center of its kind -- to double its enrollment to meet the demand. Currently, only 42 students are admitted every two years. A decade ago, there might be two or three television series in production in Denmark at any time, Mr. Ladegaard said. Now there are close to 20. That's in addition to 20 to 25 films being shot, a number that has remained steady, but exacerbates the labor shortfall because they draw from the same talent pool. The country's theater producers, who tend to book actors far in advance, are also suffering. Stine Meldgaard, a television producer, said her staff frequently must coordinate with other shows over their actors' increasingly complicated schedules.

""They'll call another production and say, 'We need him here until 2 p.m., but we can get him over to you after that,'"" Ms. Meldgaard said during an interview on Thursday at Hvidovre Hospital outside Copenhagen, where her show about a con artist couple, ""Pros and Cons,"" was shooting in an examining room. ""Luckily,"" she added, ""we're very cooperative in Denmark."" Long known for generous social welfare benefits, minimalist furniture design and Lego, Denmark was until recently just a pixel in the television world. About a dozen years ago, Danish broadcasters began ramping up their investments in high-quality TV dramas. Shows like ""The Killing"" and ""The Bridge"" helped establish the popular genre known as 'Nordic noir,"" which features brutal crimes set in bleak landscapes, and builds narratives around complicated, often tormented protagonists who contradict the region's reputation for contented, well-behaved citizens.

""The Killing"" and ""The Bridge"" earned English-language remakes in the United States, and many of the Danish projects in development today are being produced for American companies. On Dec. 3, HBO Nordic announced that its first Danish production, a young adult drama called ""Kamikaze,"" will begin shooting next year. Netflix premiered its first Danish series, ""The Rain,"" in 2017. A sci-fi tale that follows a band of young survivors after a virus wipes out most of Scandinavia, the show is currently shooting its third and final season. The first season was ""one of Netflix's most successful non-English series to date,"" said Tesha Crawford, Netflix's director of international original series. Yet it never would have been made, the show's producer and co-creator Christian Potalivo said, had it not been for the streaming platform. ""We knew that no big broadcaster in Denmark would have touched it,"" he said. ""Budget-wise and target audience-wise, it was out. We put it in a drawer until Netflix came along."" The Nordic streaming service Viaplay, which airs ""Pros and Cons,"" is even thinking of launching an all-Nordic platform in the United States and Britain. Anders Jensen, the chief executive of Viaplay's parent company, Nordic Entertainment Group, said that today ""the likelihood of a Nordic service finding an audience is much stronger.""

While all this global interest might be putting strain on production companies, it has been a boon for those working in the industry, especially people starting out. Mads Mengel, who graduated from the Danish Film School this summer, found high-profile work right away, directing a new series for DR, Denmark's largest broadcaster. ""You always hear, 'Yeah, you want to be a film director, good luck with that,'"" he said. ""So it was way beyond what I expected, to find a job in one and a half months.""

As a producer of reality and documentary shows, Ms. Mortensen's company, Heartland, tends to hire graduates of the journalism school, rather than the film school. But they, too, are in high demand. ""You have people right out of school, with no experience, getting jobs that pay 40,000 krone ($6,000) a month,"" she said. Besides pushing the film school to increase enrollment, the Danish Film Institute is also collaborating on an initiative that, if it is approved, will require broadcasters and streaming services to pay Danish production companies to cover the costs of including trainees on all their feature films and TV shows, so people new to the industry can learn as they work.

Unlike other European countries, Denmark does not offer tax incentives to production companies. The Danish film and television industry does, however, have idiosyncrasies that serve it well. Professional relationships formed at film school tend to last throughout a producer or director's career, and a strong subsidy system helps launch new filmmakers. Fluid boundaries between media mean that directors and screenwriters can bring the same degree of artistry to television as they do to film. ""Even back in the 1990s,"" said Ms. Palmquist of HBO, ""it wasn't shameful for a film director to do television."" Most important to the success of these Danish exports, industry insiders agreed, is the local talent for storytelling. ""We are very good at telling stories about people and relationships,"" said Louise Vesth, a producer of ""A Taste of Hunger,"" a new Danish film that faced difficulties hiring crew, despite having a prominent director and a starring role for Nikolaj Coster-Waldau, who played Jaime Lannister in ""Game of Thrones.""","The streaming boom has led to huge international demand for shows from this tiny country, but there aren't enough professionals to produce them.",deb3d883-044d-533a-b376-48ba78f596f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/12/15/arts/15danish-TV/06danish-TV6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b0ba4f2f29e8bd8dddaf323fb3a0664354a15336c3af5d4b8e1ab1513a69cf6e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A crew shooting a scene for &ldquo;Pros and Cons,&rdquo; one of the shows contributing to a boom in Danish-made television.",deb3d883-044d-533a-b376-48ba78f596f5,N24News/imgs/deb3d883-044d-533a-b376-48ba78f596f5.jpg,3
Economy,"U.S. in Talks on Tariff Exemptions, Trade Official Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/economy/trade-tariffs-exemptions.html,"Less than two days before the Trump administration plans to impose steep tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, its chief trade representative said Wednesday that several of the nation's top trading partners were in line for potential exemptions. The trade official, Robert Lighthizer, said at a hearing of the House Ways and Means Committee that the administration was talking with Australia, Argentina and the European Union about excluding them from the 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent charge on aluminum. He added that there were plans to talk with Brazil about possible exemptions, and raised the possibility that South Korea could be excluded as the United States continues to hold talks with Seoul over a bilateral trade agreement. Mr. Lighthizer said he favored sparing those countries from the tariffs while talks continue, though he said that decision would be ""up to the president."" Mr. Lighthizer said he expected the conversations over exclusions to conclude by the end of April.

The administration has already temporarily shielded Canada and Mexico from the tariffs during the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr. Lighthizer's testimony came a day after the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, was warned by global economic leaders at a meeting in Buenos Aires that the United States was risking a trade war by initiating the tariffs. President Trump declared earlier in the month that ""trade wars are good, and easy to win."" But Mr. Lighthizer struck a different note on Wednesday. ""Nobody wins from a trade war,"" he said. ""We certainly don't want a trade war. On the other hand, you have to ask yourself, can we go on with an $800 (and growing) billion trade deficit?""

If Mr. Trump decides to exclude Brazil and South Korea from the tariffs, and allows Canada and Mexico to remain exempt, he will have given a reprieve to the four largest foreign suppliers of steel to the United States, together accounting for half of all steel imports. That could make the tariffs less helpful to domestic steel mills.

""It raises the question of, if you exempt all of them, who's left?"" said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""It will reduce the value of the relief to the domestic industry.""

* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Foreign governments have continued to engage in high-level talks with the administration to make the case for exclusion from the tariffs. Cecilia Malmstrom, the European Union's commissioner for trade, said in a statement that she had met with the United States commerce secretary, Wilbur Ross, this week to talk about steel and aluminum trade ""with a view to identifying mutually acceptable outcomes as rapidly as possible."" Mr. Trump spoke this week with President Emmanuel Macron of France about how Europe and the United States ""might come together over tariffs,"" a White House official said in a statement. Administration officials have said that the tariffs are intended to counter an influx of cheap metals from China that are entering the United States through other countries. The Commerce Department has cited national security as the premise for the tariffs, saying that the imports are crippling domestic producers and, by extension, the nation's industrial base. Asked about reports that the administration was preparing a new set of tariffs aimed at China, Mr. Lighthizer said Mr. Trump would make a decision ""in the very near future."" Mr. Lighthizer has been investigating China's trade practices since August, including allegations of theft of intellectual property. Mr. Lighthizer indicated that the administration was specifically concerned about Chinese policies that compel American companies to share technology when they make investments in China. ""There are certain technology products that are under assault,"" he said. ""You have to give consideration to whether or not you would put tariffs on those products."" But he noted that any tariffs would take into account the economic impact of raising the cost of consumer goods. ""You would create an algorithm that would maximize the pressure on China and minimize the pressure on U.S. consumers,"" he said.",The trade representative said steel and aluminum from the European Union and several other exporters might be spared from tariffs about to be imposed.,a8152bdd-6750-5777-87fa-040b10e957fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/22/business/22TRADE1/22TRADE1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3cbe4b29cd48716935129ce73e4cc0f5fbdf0b0e4f7888bb09ae561e6d7a7db6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, said Wednesday that several of the nation's top trading partners were in line for potential tariff exemptions.",a8152bdd-6750-5777-87fa-040b10e957fc,N24News/imgs/a8152bdd-6750-5777-87fa-040b10e957fc.jpg,8
Opinion,"For Many Immigrants, an Even Greater Risk",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/25/opinion/immigrants-coronavirus.html,"I call my mother every afternoon to check in on her. She lives in a three-story Section 8 building in East New York, Brooklyn, in the apartment my siblings and I grew up in. Three of her neighbors died from Covid-19 in the last two weeks, and more than half of the families in her 12-unit building are sick. Through the walls she could hear the wails of the family who lost a loved one to the virus next door: ""Don't go! Please don't leave us!"" Another neighbor on the second floor, a middle-aged Ecuadorean man who lived with his elderly mother, died the day before Easter. The worst part, she said, is not being able to pay her respects in person, to say goodbye to the neighbors that over the years have become her family. I feel my stomach turn with guilt.

As a professor of English, I am among the New Yorkers who are able to work from home. But I am the exception in my family. My mother cleans apartments in Manhattan for a living. Her clients have all canceled, but she isn't getting paid time off or a severance package. She is draining all of her savings, money she had hoped to put toward her first house, to pay rent and utilities.

She worries about my uncle, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 and has been on a ventilator at Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn for 17 days; she worries about her church friends, many of whom have tested positive for the virus; she worries about our family in the Dominican Republic, some of whom are also infected. Most of all, she worries about my younger brother, who works at a small family-owned grocery store in Harlem, restocking shelves, managing the deli counter and preparing sandwiches for customers.

My younger brother commutes to work every day from East New York, where he lives in a cramped two-bedroom apartment with his 3-year-old son, pregnant wife and in-laws. He and his co-workers wear masks and gloves to protect themselves and the customers. Still, he fears he could get sick or, worse, bring the virus home to his family. ""People at my job are getting sick; they know what symptoms to look for -- a fever and a cough -- so they take time off,"" he told me.

Global Business,A More Circumspect View of Electric Cars,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/07/business/global/hype-over-electric-cars-subsides-at-geneva-auto-show.html,"GENEVA -- After several years of excitement over electric vehicles, the auto industry is facing a new reality. General Motors' decision last week to suspend production of its Volt plug-in hybrid sedan because of slow sales has renewed questions about whether customers were willing to pay extra for new technology. Partly as a result of the change in outlook, there is less promotion of electric cars at the Geneva auto show this year. ""Reality is phasing in,"" said Peter Schwarzenbauer, a member of the management board of Audi and the German automaker's head of marketing. ""There are still more questions than answers.""

He and other auto executives in Geneva said they still believed that electric vehicles would be an important part of the market. And some executives, like Carlos Ghosn, head of the Renault-Nissan alliance, remain bullish on the prospects for electric cars. But now that significant numbers of electric cars are in the hands of consumers, the problems inherent to an emerging technology are coming into sharper relief. Tesla, which has a booth at the Geneva show, has had to respond to an uproar on automotive blogs after the owner of a Tesla Roadster complained that his battery could not be revived after being left unplugged and low on charge for more than two months, contrary to instructions in the owner's manual. At previous shows in Geneva, a visitor could have had the impression that everyone would be driving plug-ins by now. This year, however, the spotlight is back on more traditional engines, albeit with a big emphasis on emissions and fuel efficiency. ""There was a lot of talk and less action,"" Dieter Zetsche, the chief executive of the German car and truck maker Daimler, said Tuesday.

Mr. Zetsche said he continued to believe that, in the coming decades, carmakers must find means of propulsion that do not depend on fossil fuels. ""There is no alternative,"" Mr. Zetsche said during a meeting with about a dozen journalists. ""We believe it is our responsibility to push this technology forward and make it marketable."" Daimler plans to offer an electric version of its two-seat Smart car for about 16,000 euros, or around $21,000, and continues to develop hydrogen-powered cars. But Mr. Zetsche noted that there were still a lot of problems to be solved before emission-free vehicles found a mass market, including a lack of charging stations and the continued high price.
* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. Mr. Schwarzenbauer of Audi noted that pure battery-powered cars cost thousands more to buy than conventional models, yet also had range limitations. ""I don't think this is very compelling for consumers,"" he said.

Karl-Friedrich Stracke, the chief executive of G.M.'s Opel unit, wore a ""Car of the Year"" button on his lapel Tuesday when he met with journalists. Mr. Stracke said that Opel had 7,000 orders for the Ampera, which the company started delivering in January. Sales have already surpassed those of the Toyota Prius in Germany, he said. ""We are very proud of the Ampera,"" Mr. Stracke said. ""It proves this technology is the right one."" To address the range issue, the Ampera has a small gasoline motor that can generate electricity to power the car when the batteries are depleted. Also unwavering in his conviction was Mr. Ghosn of Renault-Nissan. ""I recognize the challenges, but they are not challenging my enthusiasm,"" he said during a news conference. Mr. Ghosn said he expected sales of the all-electric Nissan Leaf to double in the United States this year, to 50,000 vehicles, as production of the car began in Tennessee. Leafs had previously been imported from Japan, Mr. Ghosn said, where the strong yen drove up the price for American buyers. The earthquake and tsunami in the country last year also disrupted production. Renault is also continuing to invest heavily in electric vehicles, despite modest sales of existing models. On Tuesday, the company introduced the production version of the Renault Zoe, a battery-powered compact.","Previous shows gave the impression everyone would be driving plug-ins by now.

Real Estate,A Midtown Apartment Offers a Change of Pace,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/realestate/a-midtown-apartment-offers-a-change-of-pace.html,"After their wedding and honeymoon in September, Brian and Stephanie Cashin turned their attention to an apartment hunt. They were living in her one-bedroom walk-up on East 14th Street, paying $2,500 a month. Mr. Cashin had moved there from a one-bedroom in a Hoboken walk-up, where the rent was $1,500. They wanted to cut expenses, so their monthly budget for a one-bedroom in the city for them and their dog, Madison, was in the low- to mid-$3,000s.

The 500-square-foot unit, with good closet space, was on the small side. And the Cashins realized they weren't excited about an amenity-free walk-up. They wanted a change -- a high-rise with a helpful staff and a hotel ambience. Hunting online ""was probably the biggest waste of time,"" said Mr. Cashin, who is from Tallahassee, Fla. ""It was way too much, so many options, so much to think about,"" along with inaccurate information. So he contacted Chip Peoples of Urban Compass, a good friend and a classmate from DePaul University in Chicago. Mr. Peoples knew that the kind of building they sought abounded in Midtown West. He suggested River Place on far West 42nd Street, where one-bedrooms were in the mid-$3,000s.

But the couple were not comfortable with the location, almost at the Hudson River. Mrs. Cashin, who is from Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, works north of Times Square. She walked the route, dodging tourists, passing the Port Authority Bus Terminal and then trudging through the more desolate areas toward the Hudson. ""Those are long blocks,"" she said. ""There are no restaurants. There is nothing there."" In her first job, fresh out of St. John's University with a degree in accounting, Mrs. Cashin -- then Stephanie Orine -- had the Related Companies as a client. Back then, the company was building the Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle. She told herself, ""Someday I want to live in one of their buildings."" Mr. Peoples suggested MiMA, also on West 42nd Street, but closer to Tenth Avenue. It happened to be a Related building. Though it was near the Port Authority, it was within easier walking distance of Mrs. Cashin's office, so she thought she might change her mind about the neighborhood.

But the couple were overwhelmed. ""The amenities are unreal,"" Mrs. Cashin said. ""There was a movie theater with a popcorn machine. It was nonstop. It was like Disney World. It was just too much energy, too much going on."" MiMA was over budget, too. One-bedrooms started at around $4,500 and studios at more than $4,000 a month. And ""it was such a weird experience"" to exit on the gritty street with its parade of buses, Mrs. Cashin said.

The Westport, however, which she saw on the Related website, seemed suitable. In the far West 50s, it was in a less frantic area than MiMA. Rents were lower, too, though by now their budget had risen to the high $3,000s. There, for $3,810 a month, they saw a nice south-facing one-bedroom of around 670 square feet. ""We still had a wandering eye,"" Mrs. Cashin said. ""Speaking with friends, it didn't seem that we had seen that many apartments.""

They had a showing scheduled at Emerald Green in the garment district on West 38th Street. One-bedrooms there were in the mid- to high-$3,000s. As they took the long walk through the lobby to the elevators, ""the first thing that came to my mind,"" Mrs. Cashin said, ""was coming home, and I have to walk Madison; she is not going to make it outside."" The pet policy was of concern, too, with Madison, at 22 pounds, weighing in over the limit. ""She is not a Great Dane; she is a cocker spaniel,"" Mrs. Cashin said. They were concerned the dog's size could be a problem. And the layout, with the bathroom far from the bedroom, didn't work for them. ""Let's say you are getting ready and having company over,"" Mrs. Cashin said. ""Sometimes you're rushing, and you're taking your shower and walking through the living room in a towel to get dressed. It was odd that they had the bathroom away from the bedroom and the washer-dryer near the bedroom, so if you put in a load before bed you are probably not going to have a good night's rest.""",Brian and Stephanie Cashin decided to switch from a walk-up to a high-rise.,f833ba2a-cd0d-50f5-b757-651764a955e1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/04/realestate/04HUNT1/HUNT1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=48bf77b57b07221c02085dfef6ea4bb2ad3b2d3579debae7860919cbc5e2d430&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,THE RENTERS Stephanie and Brian Cashin say Madison is happier in their new quarters.,f833ba2a-cd0d-50f5-b757-651764a955e1,N24News/imgs/f833ba2a-cd0d-50f5-b757-651764a955e1.jpg,7
Technology,Uber Founder Travis Kalanick Resigns as C.E.O.,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/21/technology/uber-ceo-travis-kalanick.html,"Travis Kalanick stepped down Tuesday as chief executive of Uber, the ride-hailing service that he helped found in 2009 and built into a transportation colossus, after a shareholder revolt made it untenable for him to stay on at the company. Mr. Kalanick's exit came under pressure after hours of drama involving Uber's investors, according to two people with knowledge of the situation, who asked to remain anonymous because the details were confidential. Earlier on Tuesday, five of Uber's major investors demanded that the chief executive resign immediately. The investors included one of Uber's biggest shareholders, the venture capital firm Benchmark, which has one of its partners, Bill Gurley, on Uber's board. The investors made their demand for Mr. Kalanick to step down in a letter delivered to the chief executive while he was in Chicago, said the people with knowledge of the situation.

""I love Uber more than anything in the world and at this difficult moment in my personal life I have accepted the investors request to step aside so that Uber can go back to building rather than be distracted with another fight,"" Mr. Kalanick said in a statement. Uber's board said in a statement that Mr. Kalanick had ""always put Uber first"" and that his stepping down as chief executive would give the company ""room to fully embrace this new chapter in Uber's history."" An Uber spokesman declined to comment further. The move caps months of questions over the leadership of Uber, which has become a prime example of Silicon Valley start-up culture gone awry. The company has been exposed this year as having a workplace culture that included sexual harassment and discrimination, and it has pushed the envelope in dealing with law enforcement and even partners. That tone was set by Mr. Kalanick, who has aggressively turned the company into the world's dominant ride-hailing service and upended the transportation industry around the globe.

Mr. Kalanick's troubles began earlier this year after a former Uber engineer detailed what she said was sexual harassment at the company, opening the floodgates for more complaints and spurring internal investigations. In addition, Uber has been dealing with an intellectual property lawsuit from Waymo, the self-driving car business that operates under Google's parent company, and a federal inquiry into a software tool that Uber used to sidestep some law enforcement. Uber has been trying to move past its difficult history, which has grown inextricably tied to Mr. Kalanick. In recent months, Uber has fired more than 20 employees after an investigation into the company's culture, embarked on major changes to professionalize its workplace, and is searching for new executives including a chief operating officer. Mr. Kalanick last week said he would take an indefinite leave of absence from Uber, partly to work on himself and to grieve for his mother, who died last month in a boating accident. He said Uber's day-to-day management would fall to a committee of more than 10 executives. But the shareholder letter indicated that his taking time off was not enough for some investors who have pumped millions of dollars into the ride-hailing company, which has seen its valuation swell to nearly $70 billion. For them, Mr. Kalanick had to go.

The five shareholders who demanded Mr. Kalanick's resignation include some of the technology industry's most prestigious venture capital firms, which invested in Uber at an early stage of the company's life, as well as a mutual fund firm. Apart from Benchmark, they are First Round Capital, Lowercase Capital, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity Investments, which together own more than a quarter of Uber's stock. Because some of the investors hold a type of stock that endows them with an outsize number of votes, they have about 40 percent of Uber's voting power. Benchmark, Lowercase, First Round, Menlo Ventures and Fidelity did not respond to requests for comment.

But on Twitter, Mr. Gurley of Benchmark, one of the earliest supporters of Mr. Kalanick at Uber, said of the executive, ""There will be many pages in the history books devoted to @travisk -- very few entrepreneurs have had such a lasting impact on the world."" Mr. Kalanick's resignation opens questions of who may take over Uber, especially since the company has been so molded in his image. And Mr. Kalanick will probably remain a presence there since he still retains control of a majority of Uber's voting shares.

Taking a start-up chief executive to task so publicly is relatively unusual in Silicon Valley, where investors often praise entrepreneurs and their aggressiveness, especially if their companies are growing fast. It is only when those start-ups are in a precarious position or are declining that shareholders move to protect their investment. In the case of Uber -- one of the most highly valued private companies in the world -- investors could lose billions of dollars if the company were to be marked down in valuation. Uber, which has raised more than $14 billion from investors since its founding in 2009, has a wide base of shareholders apart from the ones who signed the letter. Uber's investors also include TPG Capital, the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia, mutual fund giants like BlackRock and wealthy clients of firms like Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs. In the letter, in addition to Mr. Kalanick's immediate resignation, the five shareholders asked for improved oversight of the company's board by filling two of three empty board seats with ""truly independent directors."" They also demanded that Mr. Kalanick support a board-led search committee for a new chief executive and that Uber immediately hire an experienced chief financial officer.","The company's co-founder had been under increasing pressure, and several major investors demanded that he resign from the company immediately.",d645487f-8b5e-53fa-b078-d8e567a8a156,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/21/business/21UBER2/21UBER2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=bfb7b44e2e4a670c809d10994e5202dac0d427b6779a7b718f93f9f1abd98223&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, said last week that he would take an indefinite leave of absence.",d645487f-8b5e-53fa-b078-d8e567a8a156,N24News/imgs/d645487f-8b5e-53fa-b078-d8e567a8a156.jpg,20

""These are the things I needed: My wife.""

It is no secret that Mr. Carr was the consummate journalist and an uncommon character with a common touch. What may be less known is that when he wasn't doggedly covering the media, he could occasionally be persuaded to take a vacation -- and write about it, of course.

Of course he was one of them.

He was also at home on the ski slopes, and wrote in his trademark straightforward tone about becoming a ski family, a natural evolution for someone who learned as a boy.

Books,Bill Maher Reviews '150 Glimpses of the Beatles',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/13/books/review/150-glimpses-of-the-beatles-craig-brown.html,"Unlike so many authors these days, with their long subtitles and longer introductions that tell you what's about to unfold, Craig Brown just dives right in. No theme, no preamble, just glimpses of the Beatles (although not always of the Beatles themselves), and it's up to you to put it together. And as with the Beatles' music itself, I liked it more the more it went along. The most puzzling part of this often witty book is how much space he devotes at the beginning to (what becomes) a running feud with the curators and guides who take Beatle tourists through the storied Liverpool sites. Why so much punching down to set us off on our journey? Brown concludes one contretemps with the put-down ""Yet so far he"" -- the guide -- ""hadn't said anything that I hadn't read countless times."" Well, I thought the same thing on many pages of this book. And that's not a complaint. I like the old stories -- frankly, if I wanted something challenging to read, I wouldn't be reading ""150 Glimpses of the Beatles."" (Brown's previous book was ""Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret."") Glimpse No. 53 begins: ""For Christmas 1964, when I was 7, my brothers and I were given Beatles wigs by our parents."" If you change 7 to 8 and brothers to sister, I could have written the exact same sentence. So I knew I was disposed to like this book -- and I did. [ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of October. See the full list. ] But with a Beatles book, one always has to ask: Who is this for? Ringo is 80; if they remade ""A Hard Day's Night,"" Paul could play the part of the granddad he was looking after in the film. For the younger reader who's heard the music and now wants to know the stories behind it, good news, because they're only cliches if you've heard them a hundred times -- so for me, there were quite a few cliches: that the Lennon-McCartney magic came from the ""intermingling of the dark and the sunny,"" or that each member personified a different element: ""John fire, Paul water, George air, Ringo earth"" (although I've also heard they were like a Chinese banquet, one sweet, one sour, one salty, one spicy). Or the old one about how the timing of the Beatles' arrival in America was so key -- that for many ""two events will always be linked: The assassination of J.F.K. was winter; the Beatles are spring.""

[ Read an excerpt from ""150 Glimpses of the Beatles."" ] For this reader, when Brown tells one of the Beatle stories I've heard many times and now adds information I didn't know -- or the telling detail that was missing for 50 years -- the book is an utter delight. I knew the Beatles were introduced to LSD by their dentist, but now I know exactly who that guy was and how that night unfolded (if you can trust a 55-year-old account from people who were tripping for the first time). The Dylan-turns-them-on-to-pot-for-the-first-time scene, which all Beatlephiles know, also comes to life now in a way it never had before. As does George's visit to Haight-Ashbury in '67, which I'd always seen rendered as disillusioning, but according to Brown was life-threatening. I knew the Beatles had their sexual awakening in seamy postwar Hamburg, but I didn't know that John and Paul actually watched George lose his virginity. This band was tight! Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

According to Brown, John hit on both Jane Asher before she was with Paul, and on Pattie Boyd while she was with George. Wow. And how fascinating to find out that the famous picture of the Beatles in Miami with the not-yet-champ Muhammad Ali is kind of a lie: It's not a photo-preserved moment of the rebellious youths of their day recognizing kindred spirits in each other. The Beatles didn't like Ali (then Clay) at all, and had wanted to pose with the champ, Sonny Liston -- and Ali didn't like them either. Now, do we know that all these things are true? To quote you-know-who, it doesn't matter much to me. I doubt if there can ever be solid proof that in 1969 John suggested to Paul they undergo joint trepanning, where you have a hole drilled into your skull. Whether this was related to John's being with Yoko at that point, the author does not say -- but one would not be wrong to infer it. As many writers have been before, he's pretty hard on Yoko, and his description of Yoko's pursuit of her prey is riveting. I didn't know that Yoko wooed John with daily letters the entire time he was in India, or that she camped out on his driveway, and once jumped in his car. ""Yoko's strength lay in perseverance,"" he understates. Again, who knows what's true -- and to his credit, this is something Brown acknowledges, citing how many of the famed moments in Beatle lore are remembered and recounted differently by different Beatles' biographers and principals, not unlike the way the four Gospels do not everywhere match. The Creation Event -- the day John met Paul at the fete in Woolton on July 6, 1957 -- is such a moment, and Brown doesn't try to umpire a final version, he gives you them all. Same with the ugly moment when John beat up a man who joked Lennon might be gay. Yes, not even the Beatles could be totally woke in 1963. Also like the Bible, ""150 Glimpses of the Beatles"" is a kind of anthology -- from an author who, if I can believe the sources list in the back, read hundreds of books written by Beatle biographers and entourage members, and plucked the moments he found the most ... and that's the question, the most what? Important? Telling? Quirky? One thing most Beatle fans would say makes us love them: On their albums, there was very little filler, all of it was good. Ahem.

For example, there's a running theme of ""What ifs?"" that sound like something you'd resort to on a very long car trip, including a really annoying reimagining of history where it was Gerry and the Pacemakers who made it big, and the Beatles who were a footnote in musical history. But it's dumb, because there's a reason that it happened the way it did, not a quirk of fate. The Beatles recorded 200 terrific songs, and the Pacemakers two. And if you don't know who Gerry and the Pacemakers are, I'm not sure this will be all that interesting to you anyway. ""150 Glimpses"" is best when Brown poignantly chronicles the toll that being a Beatle took on these four still-young men in the 1960s -- the photos of them that went from smiling to unsmiling -- ""crushed by the weight of the world's adulation."" And there's a book within the book about how it turned out for ex-Beatles Stu and Pete, Beatle-for-a-week Jimmie Nicol, the long-suffering, Hera-like Cynthia Lennon, and other supporting cast members and day players caught in the orbit of the sun gods. Spoiler alert: not well. In describing watching a Beatle tribute band, Brown says: ""One half of your brain recognizes that these are not the Beatles: How could they be? But the other half is happy to believe that they are."" It's like that with this book. Would it have been better if it were 99 glimpses and I didn't have to wade through glimpsing Margaret Thatcher, or who was standing inadvertently in the background of the ""Abbey Road"" cover, or whatever happened to the Singing Nun? Yes, I think it would -- but you can't always get what you want. Wait, that's the Stones.","Craig Brown follows up the best-selling ""Ninety-Nine Glimpses of Princess Margaret"" with a book about John, Paul, George and Ringo.",5a77ffd1-300f-51a4-b77e-a9036d9c6c96,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/06/books/review/06Maher/Maher-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7e81216def19b7e33eca1d2f8aa477aea166a09d8cd1a10f6fd187eb3953e72f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Beatles in 1967: &ldquo;John fire, Paul water, George air, Ringo earth.&rdquo;",5a77ffd1-300f-51a4-b77e-a9036d9c6c96,N24News/imgs/5a77ffd1-300f-51a4-b77e-a9036d9c6c96.jpg,13
Global Business,"European Central Bank, Under New Chief, Cuts Key Rate",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/04/business/global/european-central-bank-cuts-rates-hoping-to-avert-downturn.html,"FRANKFURT -- The new president of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, quickly responded to the latest developments in the sovereign debt crisis on Thursday, overseeing a cut in the euro zone's benchmark interest rate while warning of a mild recession. Two days after assuming office in one of the most turbulent phases in the history of the euro zone, Mr. Draghi signaled that he might be more willing than his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, to tolerate inflation in the name of economic growth. The bank cut the benchmark rate to 1.25 percent from 1.5 percent, a move aimed at putting more money into the European economy by making borrowing easier. Investors cheered the decision by pushing stocks higher in Europe and the United States. The cut, which surprised some analysts, may signal a shift in strategy -- or at least in tone -- at the bank, which oversees monetary policy for the 17 European Union nations that share the euro. Known for his caution, Mr. Draghi, formerly the governor of the Bank of Italy, was not expected to make bold moves so soon. But speaking to reporters after he presided as chairman of the bank's governing council for the first time, Mr. Draghi indicated that he felt he had little choice but to reduce interest rates. He warned that economic growth was likely to be significantly worse than the bank expected. That assessment came a day after the Federal Reserve also reduced its growth forecasts through 2013.

While campaigning this year to succeed Mr. Trichet, Mr. Draghi emphasized his credentials as an inflation fighter and as a voice of fiscal prudence in his native Italy. But on Thursday, he played down the risks posed by inflation, which at a current annual rate of 3 percent is above the bank's target of about 2 percent. Slower growth, he indicated, would act as its own curb on inflation. ""In such an environment, price, cost and wage pressures in the euro area should also be moderate,"" he said. ""Today's decision takes this into account."" At the same time, though, Mr. Draghi disappointed those who want the bank to help calm skittish global investors by aggressively buying European government bonds, using its ability to print money to reduce the risk that the Greek crisis might create a contagion infecting Italy, Spain and others. He stuck to the position that the bond purchases the bank has been making since the spring of 2010 were temporary and limited, and justified solely as a way for the bank to maintain its control over interest rates. Rather, Mr. Draghi said, it was up to national leaders to regain investor confidence by reining in spending and removing excessive regulations and other obstacles to growth. ""The first and foremost responsibility for maintaining financial stability lies with national economic policies,"" he said. Mr. Draghi's statements on bond market intervention led some analysts to conclude that, despite the rate cut, he would not veer significantly from the path set by Mr. Trichet. Mr. Draghi described his predecessor on Thursday as a ""role model.""

The bank has spent 173.5 billion euros, or $240 billion, intervening in bond markets since May 2010, a modest sum compared with the securities purchases made by the Fed or the Bank of England to help prop up their own financial markets and stimulate their economies. ""The E.C.B. seems to be continuing to play its dangerous game of doing the minimum amount possible, counting on the European politicians to extinguish the fire,"" Jens Sondergaard, an analyst at Nomura, wrote Thursday in a note to clients. Still, some analysts said that Mr. Draghi's statements on bond buying should not be taken at face value and that the bank would intervene if necessary to save the euro. ""If worse came to worst, the E.C.B. would buy government bonds on a massive scale,"" Jorg Kramer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, wrote in a note. But Mr. Draghi cannot say that out loud, the thinking goes, for fear that leaders like Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi of Italy would renege on promises to remove barriers to competition and improve economic performance. ""It is understandable that they don't want to give governments a free lunch,"" said Marie Diron, a former European Central Bank economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young. European stocks rose sharply after the bank rate announcement. The Euro Stoxx 50, a barometer of euro zone blue chips, climbed 2.45 percent, helped by signs that Greece would move ahead with the bailout plan. The euro rose to $1.3812. The main United States stock gauges also rose.

After just one meeting of the governing council, it was too early to say whether Mr. Draghi would set the bank on a new course. But he seemed to confirm predictions by some analysts that he would take a more nuanced view of inflation than Mr. Trichet, who was not an economist. Mr. Draghi has a doctorate in the field. Mr. Draghi on Thursday seemed at ease as the top official at the central bank, rather than just one vote on the governing council. He sparred confidently with reporters and seemed to answer questions more directly than Mr. Trichet, who had been prone to digressions. Mr. Draghi seemed to be ""a bit more open,"" Ms. Diron said. She noted his frank use of the word ""recession."" ""It is unusual that the E.C.B. would use these words before the data is published,"" she said. Mr. Draghi, however, also added an extra degree of formality to the monthly news conference, delegating an aide to choose questioners. Mr. Trichet made such selections himself. The rate cut is the first by the bank since May 2009. It came after interest rate increases in April and July under Mr. Trichet, which many analysts say have made Europe's economic woes worse than they would be otherwise. Mr. Draghi said the decision to cut rates was unanimous -- a surprise considering the reverence with which German members of the bank's governing council regard price stability. Mr. Draghi has assumed office with Greece's future in the euro zone in doubt. But he rejected suggestions that Greece could exit, saying there was no legal provision for the country to do so. ""It's not in the treaty,"" he said. ""I have nothing to add to that.""","In Mario Draghi's first meeting as president, the bank lowered Europe's benchmark rate to 1.25 percent amid gloomy economic reports and tension over Greece.",4902ef35-59ec-5148-8110-915b15a3b58d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/11/04/business/ECB_337_span/ECB-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=9675d3c8e2593f97cf9a1584ea2b19f1e16ca93ebd644df3f39ad10f52c540e0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mario Draghi of the European Central Bank, said Thursday that economic growth was likely to be worse than the bank expected.",4902ef35-59ec-5148-8110-915b15a3b58d,N24News/imgs/4902ef35-59ec-5148-8110-915b15a3b58d.jpg,24
Theater,"Review: In 'Black Exhibition,' a Playwright Exposed",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/12/theater/black-exhibition-review-jeremy-o-harris.html,"Why would a charismatic young playwright, with a critical hit playing to 800 people a night in Midtown, debut a new work, in which he also stars, at a 72-seat theatrical incubator so far off Broadway it's in Brooklyn? And why would he do so under a pseudonym that sounds like the name of a bot? The answer isn't that @GaryXXXFisher -- as the author and pseudo-autobiographical main character of ""Black Exhibition"" are called -- is hiding a messy, heartfelt, intensely personal spectacle from too much scrutiny. Or it's not just that. The main reason is that @GaryXXXFisher is really Jeremy O. Harris, the author of ""Slave Play,"" and he is savvy enough to understand that his new play isn't for everyone. In the same way, he knew that ""Slave Play"" was. (Its transfer from New York Theater Workshop to Broadway this season was a great and moving surprise.) Though tightly focused on three interracial couples spending a week at a sex therapy retreat, ""Slave Play"" encompasses the entire scope of interracial America. From a handful of characters, it implies millions.

""Black Exhibition,"" which opened on Saturday at the invaluable Bushwick Starr, turns the telescope the other way around. I t features five characters who represent different aspects of outlaw sexuality, but narrows down to just one subject: its author. Part notebook, part incantation, part primal therapy, it is so esoteric it sometimes seems as if it were written in a language with just one speaker left.

And language is key here. Harris invokes Ntozake Shange's term ""choreopoem"" to describe a collagelike construction that incorporates free verse, choral speaking, dance, tableaux vivants and (in his case, not hers) text message chains about getting gonorrhea in Berlin . The result is by turns caustic, coy, baffling, impish, embarrassing, insightful and, as the pseudonym suggests, frank. But if Shange's ""For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"" celebrates the healing power of community, ""Black Exhibition"" feels neither healing nor communitarian. Harris plays a figure based on the real Gary Fisher: a gay black writer who died of AIDS in 1994, leaving behind a small but potent body of work. In Gary's skin, Harris undergoes a kind of sacrificial flaying as the world he wants to be part of also torments him with its gaze.

In truth, that gaze can seem self-inflicted; Harris elects to spend most of the 60-minute work, directed by Machel Ros s and beautifully designed by Frank J. Oliva for the tiny Bushwick Starr space, in little more than a jockstrap. (The droll costumes are by Sabrina Bianca Guillaume .) He is just as exposed in his quest for ecstatic spiritual communion.

The four other characters, or perhaps they are merely Harris's avatars, advise him on issues of art, submission and self-display. The experimental feminist writer Kathy Acker (Ross Days) offers a paean to anal sex as a way to see God (or at least Elaine Stritch). The Japanese poet Yukio Mishima (Miles Greenberg) schools Gary in ""necessary fascisms."" And the gay Afro-Futurist Samuel Delany ( Dhari Noel ) sings the ambivalent praises of Fire Island, where raunch is integrated into the landscape, yet the rich have ""gentrified the trees."" The three writers make some sense as Gary's spirit guides; he has been reading them while visiting that gay playland. What the fourth is doing in the story is harder to say. Called MandinGO, he is based on Michael L. Johnson, the black athlete sentenced, after a trial later ruled to be ""fundamentally unfair,"" to 30 years in prison for not disclosing his H.I.V. status to sexual partners. Perhaps MandinGO ( AJ Harris ) represents the twinned problems Gary is flirting with: the vulnerability of gay black bodies in white spaces, and the vulnerability of all bodies in the path of disease. If I am uncertain about this, as about so much here, that's fine with me. I don't mind having to ponder the recondite (and wittily worded) questions Harris keeps sparking as Gary travels his ""dark gay path."" I look to the theater, in part, to show me the lives of my co-humans as they live them beyond my ken. What it means to be a gay black man in the world is not, for instance, an experience I can ever have directly. But writer's block is, and that's another of the play's subjects, if not in fact its raison d'etre. Harris draws a sly connection between -- I'll put this delicately -- the openness to sex and the openness to inspiration. On the evidence of ""Black Exhibition,"" I'd say he's at least got some good foreplay going. Black Exhibition

Science,"Baleen Whales Intermingled as They Evolved, and Share DNA With Distant Cousins",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/science/baleen-whales-evolution-genome.html,"For years, scientists have disagreed about which species of baleen whale came first, and how the toothless species were related. Body structure suggested one set of relationships; molecular data suggested another. Now, researchers in Germany and Sweden have sequenced the DNA of six of the living species, of which there are at least 10. The relationships are so complicated, however, that the senior researcher Axel Janke said ""family tree"" is too simple a metaphor. Instead, the species, all part of a group called rorquals, have evolved more into a network, sharing large segments of DNA with even distant cousins. Scientists expressed surprise that there had been so much intermingling of baleen whales, given the variety of sizes and shapes.

Humpback and sei whales are relatively similar in size, for instance -- both usually measuring longer than a school bus. But the blue whale, which is the largest animal to ever live and would dwarf an 18-wheeler, is a close relation to the sei, and relatively distant from the humpback, according to the study, published on Wednesday in the journal Science Advances.

The North Atlantic right whales and bowhead whales split from the other baleens about 28 million years ago; among the rorquals, minke whales seem to have begun diverging more than 10 million years ago; and the blue and sei whales split from the remaining around five million years ago, the study found. The study of rorqual evolution also defies simple Darwinian theories. Darwin explained that many species evolved when they became isolated from others of their kind, accumulating genetic differences and adapting to a new environment. But whales roam the entire ocean, where there are no geographic barriers that would isolate them. Instead, Dr. Janke said, at least some of the whale speciation has been driven by personal taste. Baleen whales developed sophisticated systems to open their jaws wide enough to suck in almost their own body weight worth of water, along with the tiny creatures swimming or floating in it. Gray whales are part of the same family, but preferred to eat krill and other organisms, slurping them up as they swam along -- which possibly led them to become their own species.

""Whales can tell us new stories of how species can evolve into different forms,"" said Dr. Janke, also a professor of evolutionary biology at Senckenberg Biodiversity and Climate Research Centre, and Goethe University in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. The idea that species can intermingle is new, even to scientists, said Scott Edwards, an evolutionary biologist at Harvard University, who was not involved in the new study. ""Ten years ago, most evolutionary biologists would have assumed that a species is a species, especially when they look phenotypically distinct,"" Dr. Edwards said. Recent research has shown that humans, too, are the product of species intermingling. There are varying levels of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA across the human population. Dr. Janke said he was also struck by the wide range of genetic diversity he saw within whale species. Genetic diversity helps animals survive change. ""The whaling moratorium, where they stopped whaling in 1978, came just in time to prevent this biodiversity from being genetically more monotonous,"" he said. ""If that had been the case, it would have been difficult to envision how the species could survive."" The DNA samples in the study were taken mainly from biopsies collected with remote darting; the gray whale samples came from Alaska, where the Museum of Fairbanks secured samples from deceased animals, Dr. Janke said.","Genome sequencing of six species of baleen whales shows how they have evolved into more of a network and have a wide range of genetic diversity, according to a new study.",4c2fcc54-3809-58d4-be31-ae019d16255b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/05/science/05TB-WHALES1/05TB-WHALES1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=43b22a40b72180a0458f1c90d19b71dd5afa294fef1f9e751f4f51b72f191b65&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Fin whales differ in size, color and body shape from their cousins, the larger blue whale, but scientists decoding the genome of several baleen species say there was intermingling during the course of their evolution.",4c2fcc54-3809-58d4-be31-ae019d16255b,N24News/imgs/4c2fcc54-3809-58d4-be31-ae019d16255b.jpg,2
Media,"Thiel Makes a Bid for Gawker.com, a Site He Helped Bankrupt",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/business/media/thiel-gawker-bid.html,"Mr. Thiel, who has an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion, according to Forbes, has the means to beat almost any rival bidder. But Mr. Holden said the ""ethos"" of Gawker -- which prided itself on a wry, pirate-ship approach to reporting -- would also be considered in determining new ownership of the Gawker name.

Gawker Media went bankrupt in 2016 after a $140 million legal judgment against it in an invasion-of-privacy case brought by the former wrestler Hulk Hogan. Gawker.com had published a black-and-white sex tape of Mr. Hogan, whose real name is Terry G. Bollea; a Florida jury awarded damages to the wrestler after a two-week trial.

It also emerged that Mr. Thiel had spent about $10 million in secretly backing the lawsuit, a move that many Gawker employees interpreted as an attempt at revenge. Mr. Thiel told The New York Times: ""It's less about revenge and more about specific deterrence. I saw Gawker pioneer a unique and incredibly damaging way of getting attention by bullying people even when there was no connection with the public interest.""

Univision bought Gawker Media at auction in August 2016 for $135 million. The company changed the name of its new asset to Gizmodo Media Group, after the group's Gizmodo tech blog, and jettisoned the Gawker.com flagship site, which remains online, albeit in a static form, a digital orphan. Raju Narisetti, formerly an executive at News Corporation, took the place of the Gawker Media founder, Nick Denton, as the chief executive officer.

Mr. Thiel's interest in buying Gawker.com has led to speculation that he might delete the site's archives, effectively erasing its journalism from the web. A spokesman for the billionaire did not respond to multiple inquiries for comment.","Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire, helped run Gawker Media offline.

Automobiles,"Same Name, but Gentler in Attitude",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/09/automobiles/autoreviews/same-name-but-gentler-in-attitude.html,"The original Cherokee's design was so square, it could be mistaken for the box it came in. Jeep has revived the name for 2014 and has put quite a curve on the styling.

The cry goes up every time a new model appears from the venerable marque, so no doubt the marketers at Fiat Chrysler knew what they were provoking when they went a big step further in resurrecting the Cherokee nameplate for their new midlevel Jeep. It was a risk, starting with the look. Few American vehicles are as recognizable as the old Cherokee, which ended a 17-year run in 2001 but still commands passionate devotion among its many owners. That Cherokee combined the sharp angles, seven-slot grille and off-road prowess of the classic CJ Jeep with the convenience of a station wagon to create what Robert Cumberford, the automotive design critic at Automobile magazine, proclaimed ""possibly the best S.U.V. shape of all time."" The 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk in Deep Cherry Red that I recently drove would have trouble living up to that claim. Viewed from the side, its soft edges looked a tad generic, though the brand's signature trapezoidal wheel openings and chunky tires kept it respectable. Meeting it head-on for the first time, however, was a bit of a shock, with three squinty lines of lamps (running lights, headlights and fog lights) bracketing the trademark slotted grille and a broad grinning opening below the bumper. It takes a bit of getting used to.

Before I go on, full disclosure: I've owned a '96 Cherokee for many years and have a deep emotional tie to it, even though a lot of its green paint has peeled off, it left me to spend a night in the woods when some of its wiring melted and it is tricky to maneuver on pavement because of the huge tires I installed last summer. Look, it makes me feel good, especially when we churn fearlessly along a flooded, deeply rutted, rock-strewn Quebec logging trail in the Laurentians with a couple of kayaks strapped to the conveniently low roof, in search of big bass. In the end, it's not the look, but mountain-goat sure-footedness that makes a Jeep a Jeep. The Cherokee Trailhawk carries the Trail Rated designation, which is Jeep-speak for real cred in five aspects of off-roading -- traction, ground clearance, maneuverability, articulation and water fording. So off we drove to the Catoctin ridge in northern Maryland in search of bad roads. Granted, Catoctin Mountain ain't Moab, the mecca for off-roaders in Utah, but we crept up some pretty steep trails, bumping over logs and rocks and slithering through mud with no complaining or creaking from the Jeep. My main plaint was the curtailed visibility over the rounded hood and through the high rear window, which I coped with by raising the driver's seat as high as it would go. The 3.2-liter V6, with 271 horsepower and 239 pound-feet of torque, was quiet and had plenty of power, especially in the crawl ratios, though I missed the instant kick of the old Cherokee's in-line 6 -- a factor, perhaps, of the more refined 2014 model being more than 1,000 pounds heavier. The hill descent system was an especially fun feature, in the way roller coasters are nail-bitingly fun, keeping speed in check down one long, badly rutted hill. At the bottom, though, a vehicle marked Volunteer Sheriff slowed for a look -- maybe it was the shock of the front end styling, or maybe we were close to Camp David.

Then we came upon an almost vertical hillock strewn with boulders under wet leaves. Three times I tried, engaging various electronic off-road aids -- the low range with locking differential, the Selec-Terrain system that let me choose among Auto, Snow, Sport, Sand-Mud and Rock -- but I never did crest that hill. There was a lot of very energetic back-and-forthing among the front and rear wheels, but not enough to put us over the top. To be honest, I have no doubt that with a running start and the pedal closer to the floor the 'Hawk would have made it. But this is a problem with luxurious S.U.V.'s like the Cherokee: Many, no doubt, have the wherewithal to take abuse, but few actively invite it the way old Jeeps do. I just wouldn't feel right ramming a shiny new vehicle through conditions that have so deeply and nobly scarred my old XJ.

Which brings up a second point: Not many shoppers would buy a crossover if their specific intention was roughing it up. The first design proposals of the XJ date to 1978, and it arrived in showrooms in 1984, ages before sport utility vehicles gave way to car-based models like the Toyota RAV4 or the Honda CR-V and became one of the most competitive segments of the market. Today, buyers of these tamer, more civilized S.U.V. successors are really looking for a comfortable station wagon with a bit of attitude and some extra traction, not an agricultural implement. Those who long for a true successor to the XJs of old would probably be best served by a four-door Jeep Wrangler Unlimited. My wife underscored this reality when I put the Big Question to her: So, is the Trailhawk a true Cherokee? ""Thank God, no,"" said she, poking the 8.4-inch display to turn up the seat warmer under the supple and elegantly stitched brown leather of the front passenger seat. That sums up the challenge faced by Chrysler and its Fiat owners when plotting a replacement for the Jeep Liberty, the discontinued (and little-mourned) successor to the XJ: to produce a crossover that could compete with the likes of the RAV4 and CR-V for the suburban market -- and still get some respect from the Cherokee nation.

Their answer, in effect, was to make one of every flavor, starting with a front-wheel-drive Sport model at $23,990 for entry-level suburban duty, and working their way through three 4-wheel-drive systems, two engines (a 4 and a V6) and three levels of equipment to the stand-alone Trail Rated Trailhawk, at $30,490 and up. That's a lot more range than the competition offers. Transforming a front-wheel-drive crossover into an off-road contender required, first of all, bolting in Jeep's most sophisticated drive system, called Jeep Active Drive Lock II, which incorporates a low range and locking rear differential. To that, Jeep added the Selec-Terrain system, hill descent and ascent control, an off-road suspension with an extra inch of ground clearance, skid plates shielding the vulnerable chassis underpinnings, bright red functional tow hooks front and aft, all-terrain tires, provisions for wading through 20-inch-deep water and a singular look expressed in a hood painted flat-black, special wheels and different fascias front and rear. I drove only the Trailhawk with an optional 3.2-liter V6. With a power liftgate, remote start, backup camera, heated seats and steering wheel, power-adjustable seats and some other extras, the sticker price was $36,120. The E.P.A. rates fuel consumption at a decent 18 miles per gallon in town and 25 highway, and that's about what we got with the hills and all. The interior of the Trailhawk is hard to fault. It's quiet, the surfaces are high rent, the leather beautifully stitched, the controls intuitive and where you want them to be. Storage compartments abound, including a generous one under the passenger seat cushion. Despite the off-road suspension, the ride, whether cruising on the highway or meandering on paved mountain roads, was serene and smooth. It would have been nice to add a few all-terrain touches inside, like a grab handle on the A-pillar for the passenger, but there were multiple hooks and nets in the back to secure gear. The main nit I had was that the Cherokee seemed a bit slow to react to the accelerator, especially when reaching for a lower gear to gain speed. All Cherokees share a 9-speed automatic transmission, and there were reports that the introduction of the model was delayed to give Chrysler engineers more time to tailor the transmission to all the engines and drive systems. Is it a Jeep? I say yes. The Cherokee Trailhawk is a nice, competent and comfortable entry that can also romp with real 4-by-4s. Is it a worthy successor to the Cherokee? Well, it is definitely not the old XJ, for better and for worse, and I doubt it will ever replace the emotional bonds that icon commanded. And it will take a few years to see whether that funny face and car-based chassis will hold up in the real world.","The Trailhawk is competent, comfortable and can romp with real 4-by-4s, but is it a worthy successor to the classic Cherokee?",fb83d232-628b-526f-be16-e6e9d45ebd53,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/02/09/automobiles/WHEEL/WHEEL-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=392&w=600&s=432873c420dae9aad1356e8e0a6450ff453e2a75a7c1d50b8425a29f360425e5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The 2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk.,fb83d232-628b-526f-be16-e6e9d45ebd53,N24News/imgs/fb83d232-628b-526f-be16-e6e9d45ebd53.jpg,23

Real Estate,"Old Neighborhood, New Life",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/realestate/long-island-in-the-region-same-neighborhood-new-life.html,"HOME AGAIN Emily De Nicolo, who recently bought the split-level ranch in the background, is moving back to her Port Washington neighborhood with her husband after living in Manhattan for 14 years.

EMILY De NICOLO has lived in Manhattan for the last 14 years. But as she and her husband, Jay Della Monica, prepare for the arrival of their first child, in August, city life is looking more and more like a thing of the past. In fact, the couple are anticipating a future in Port Washington, Ms. De Nicolo's childhood home. They will soon be closing on a five-bedroom three-bath split-level ranch, at the other end of the block from the house she grew up in, a custom contemporary for which her parents paid $76,000 in 1976. ""You can add a zero to that,"" she said of the price she and Mr. Della Monica are paying as a result of a bidding war with three other couples. ""Port Washington is a little more diverse than other towns, and it is an ideal commute to the city,"" she said. ""It is more favorable for young families, and you have a great school district, especially with a baby on the way."" Though her parents have since retired and relocated to Florida, Ms. De Nicolo is thrilled to be moving back. ""It's more of a comfort knowing that my friends I grew up with are right there, versus moving to another town where I wouldn't know anyone,"" she said. In Port Washington, she won't have to figure out which dry-cleaners and nail salon to frequent. Because she works full time in pharmaceutical sales, ""I do need the support system,"" including one of her best friends from nursery school, who wouldn't hesitate to help out. Ms. De Nicolo, 37, and Mr. Della Monica, 42, are part of a small number of young adults who are moving back to the Island after spending their post-college years in the city. Notwithstanding the contentions of local planners and elected officials that a tide of young adults is moving away, some are bucking that trend, though perhaps after a longer hiatus than in previous generations who married, had children and moved to the suburbs sooner.

Ryan Patrick Donnelly II, the president and managing partner of the Donnelly Group, a real estate firm in Garden City, said, ""Pretty much 50 percent of the buyers coming into town either grew up here or have friends here."" Most moved to Manhattan after college, stayed for about a decade, married and started a family. ""They either move back right after the children are born or when the kids are nursery-school age,"" he said, citing the high nursery-school tuition in the city as a motivating factor. And there is another important one: Instead of nannies, most people in the suburbs ""have the grandparents to take care of the kids."" Many would stay in the city if they could afford apartments large enough to accommodate their families, Mr. Donnelly said, ""but rents are so high in Manhattan they are being forced out. With salary increases not keeping pace with rent hikes and interest rates so low, it makes sense"" to return to the Island. They aren't, however, relying on the Bank of Mom and Dad to finance their purchase. The buying couples are in their mid- to late 30s and are ""pretty much all self-sufficient,"" Mr. Donnelly said. ""They have been saving and living in small apartments"" to be able to buy homes in the $600,000-to-$800,000 range. When Alison Epstein and Jeff Brenner got married two and a half years ago, it was understood that ""as much as we liked the city, we both saw ourselves in a house with a yard in the suburbs,"" said Ms. Epstein Brenner, 29.

She is originally from Great Neck; Mr. Brenner, 31, is from Oceanside. Both moved to Manhattan after college -- she from Emory University in Atlanta and he from the University of Michigan. This past winter, as jackhammers banged relentlessly on the Second Avenue subway in front of their one-bedroom Upper East Side apartment, they debated: North Shore or South Shore? They started their home search in Port Washington, then compared what they could get in their high-$700,000s price range in Merrick. The South Shore offered more. ""I liked that it was near the beach and the mall and the highway and the North and South Shore,"" she said. On June 22 the Brenners are moving into a four-bedroom split-level ranch with a newly redone kitchen on the Merrick waterfront, strategically situated between their families and a 45-minute commute via the Long Island Rail Road to their jobs in television advertising. Mr. Brenner called the return to the Island ""the natural progression of things,"" pushed along by the subway construction, the dip in home prices and low interest rates that would make the mortgage on a house cheaper than a two-bedroom rental in Manhattan. ""We were ready -- we both came to the city after college and had our fun,"" he said, adding that they expected some ""city friends"" to join them in the next year or two. ""I feel like I am turning the page a little bit."" Not all of the returning Islanders are quite ready to buy. Tim and Gina DiPietro, who married in October, rent a one-bedroom apartment in the East Village, which ""couldn't be more fun."" But Mr. DiPietro, 28, who lived in Mill Neck until he was 10, is a broker specializing in historic properties for an insurance company in Locust Valley. The couple are sailing aficionados, and spend nearly every weekend on the Island at his grandmother's or with friends. ""I always had the desire to get back out,"" he said. Ms. DiPietro, 27, who is originally from Maplewood, N.J., ""developed an affinity for it, too."" Even their English bulldog ""is exponentially happier out here than in the city."" Come October they will be renting a four-bedroom carriage house in Mill Neck for about $3,000 a month, with the possibility of improving the home and grounds in lieu of rent. Among their friends, Mr. DiPietro said, ""we are a little ahead of the charge, but the ones who grew up out here seem envious of our move.""","A small number of young adults are bucking the youth-flight trend, moving back to the Island after spending post-college years in the city.",dfa23a5a-2844-5fbe-86a7-b876afde6725,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/24/realestate/24LIZO_SPAN/24LIZO_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=595a21c3a715acb078d81fda5e0a13b6226d07b56842046dbe0f01ef048d2dd5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"HOME AGAIN  Emily De Nicolo, who recently bought the split-level ranch in the background, is moving back to her Port Washington neighborhood with her husband after living in Manhattan for 14 years.",dfa23a5a-2844-5fbe-86a7-b876afde6725,N24News/imgs/dfa23a5a-2844-5fbe-86a7-b876afde6725.jpg,7
Real Estate,Setting a Fresh Table,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/30/realestate/setting-a-fresh-table.html,"You don't have to decorate with pumpkins and turkeys just because it's Thanksgiving. Robin Standefer, of Roman and Williams, suggested using plants and fruit instead: ""We always consider what's magical and what brings delight.""



Tired of holiday cliches? Here's how to create a table setting that will surprise and delight your guests.

A festive table setting is about more than just providing some decor for your holiday dinner. It can set the mood for a party, spark conversations among guests and give you an excuse to dust off your grandmother's silver and china. But how do you pull everything together in a creative way that doesn't feel cliched? For advice, we turned to interior designers, florists and event planners known for creating striking tablescapes. ""The foundation of your holiday table is the textile you choose for your runner or tablecloth and napkins,"" said Liz Curtis, the founder of Table + Teaspoon, a San Francisco rental service that offers preplanned table settings starting at $24 a person. Go with a neutral color and pattern, rather than a holiday theme, to create ""an elegant, elevated feel for your guests,"" Ms. Curtis said. ""Matouk scalloped linens and Aerin Lauder's line for Williams Sonoma are my go-to for tablecloths and napkins.""

""The holidays are a time to celebrate family, so the most meaningful decorations weave together the personal and the festive,"" said Bronson van Wyck, who owns a design and event production company, Van Wyck & Van Wyck, with his mother, Mary Lynn van Wyck. At Christmas dinner for family and friends in Manhattan, Mr. van Wyck, who is of Scottish and Dutch descent, uses tartan-patterned napkins and blue-and-white china. ""Not an obvious combination,"" he said. ""But even patterns that don't seem to fit the occasion work if they're mixed and matched with confidence and whimsy."" To add another personal touch, Mr. van Wyck said, ""I will sometimes embroider the initials of my guests onto napkins, which I then use as place cards"" that guests can take home.

""Guests love to see themselves,"" he said, ""whether it's their photo tagged on social media, their reflection in a mirror or even just their own name beautifully written on an elegant place card. In an age of personalization, think about how you can take this to the next level."" ""In a season where many of us spend most of our time keeping warm indoors, there is something so special about using pieces from the earth, by adding a garland of greenery or winter fruits down the center of the table,"" said Maggie Burns, the owner of Maggie Richmond Design, in Manhattan. ""Pomegranates and figs add the perfect punch of holiday red to a place setting, and nothing smells more beautiful than sprigs of evergreen scattered throughout the house."" Maggie Burns, the owner of Maggie Richmond Design, likes to run a garland of greenery and winter fruits down the center of the table. Mr. van Wyck, who grew up in Arkansas, likes to hang a magnolia wreath. ""It's a traditional symbol of hospitality in the South,"" he said. ""And the leaves look just as great dried as they do freshly cut, so it's not a once-and-done purchase."" He added: ""The combination of deep green and brown and gold is a perfect palette for holiday decorating. You get a lot of bang for your buck, because they work for Thanksgiving as well as Christmas."" Robin Standefer, who owns the design firm Roman and Williams with her husband, Stephen Alesch, suggested decorating with plants, flowers, fruit and herbs.

""I've never used a formula when setting a table, and I definitely don't want it to feel so perfect that you're afraid to mess it up,"" said Ken Fulk, an event designer in San Francisco known for his exuberant style. ""It should be loosely arranged for balance, but not perfectly symmetrical."" Glassware and silver should be arranged in the order they're used, starting from the outside and working your way in, he said. ""But we give ourselves some flexibility with glasses when there are more than five pairings. In those cases, we're often mixing vintage glassware with crystal, and it looks so much prettier to arrange by style, size or color."" Ms. Standefer and Mr. Alesch have a similar philosophy: ""Stephen and I take classic placement of utensils and tabletop tools seriously, but we don't let these restrictions limit the needs of our table,"" she said. ""The standard of outside-in can be revisited depending on the density of the table and amount of guests. So we might put the utensils above the plate if the place settings are close together or if we are using flora on the plate."" ""Nothing speaks louder in a setting of celebration than the clinking of water or wine glasses,"" Ms. Standefer said, noting that the right glassware can influence the mood at the table. So which stemware to choose? ""There really are no absolutes in finding the right pieces for your home, as long as they are functional and beautiful, of the earth and hold narrative,"" she said. ""A robust glassware collection can be high and low -- glass you admire that you've found at a flea market or a set you invest in from the collection of an expert artisan whose work you follow."" The important thing, she added, is that it's not so precious you're afraid to use it.

Caroline Bailly, the owner of L'Atelier Rouge, a Manhattan floral design and event company, likes to use purple eggplants, kale and bunches of root vegetables like radishes and beets to add texture, color and interest to her floral arrangements. ""I am always inspired by the farmers' markets,"" she said. For one harvest-themed arrangement, she and her creative director, Takaya Sato, turned a bushel of carrots upside down, so the green trimmings flowed over the edge of a bowl and the points stood up like a wonky bouquet. Ms. Bailly recommended playing with color blocks and asymmetry, even when you're working with more traditional bouquets.

Movies,'Sopranos' Creator Will Bring a Prequel to Movie Screens,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/08/movies/sopranos-prequel-movie-david-chase.html,"David Chase will bring ""The Sopranos"" to movie theaters, Warner Bros. announced on Thursday.

But don't expect him to explain the contentious ending to the celebrated mafia series he created, which ran on HBO from 1999 to 2007. Mr. Chase is going back to the beginning -- way back, to the Newark riots in 1967, when Tony Soprano was still a boy.

""David is a masterful storyteller and we, along with our colleagues at HBO, are thrilled that he has decided to revisit, and enlarge, the Soprano universe in a feature film,"" Toby Emmerich, chairman of the Warner Bros. Picture Group, said in a statement.

""The Many Saints of Newark,"" as Mr. Chase's prequel is tentatively called, will include some well-known characters from ""The Sopranos,"" according to the studio. Which ones? A spokeswoman wouldn't elaborate.

Fans of the TV series may remember that Tony Soprano, its main character, was born in 1959. The prequel, which still has no cast, director or estimated release date, carries this official description: ""A prequel to 'The Sopranos' set in the era of the Newark riots in the '60s, when the African-Americans and the Italians of Newark were at each other's throats, and when among the gangsters of each group, it became especially lethal.""","David Chase has written the screenplay for the film, tentatively titled ""The Many Saints of Newark,"" which will be set in 1960s New Jersey.",5d4289c4-1d1d-5921-9bb2-313ed5b653f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/09/movies/09sopranos1/09sopranos1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=bec7072a5c4db99d64358642d6a0384bea55dde6b0b5e5aad850a3ecb309f92c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Chase in 2012, when his last film, ""Not Fade Away,"" was released.

Health,Abortion Pill Orders Rise in 7 Latin American Nations on Zika Alert,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/23/health/zika-virus-abortion-pill-latin-america.html,"Orders for abortion pills by women in seven Latin American countries with Zika outbreaks increased after health officials in those countries warned that the virus might cause severe birth defects, according to a women's organization supplying such pills. Orders from women in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela roughly doubled, while those from Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador and Honduras went up by from 36 percent to 76 percent, researchers said in a study published Wednesday by The New England Journal of Medicine. The authors of the study included a leader of the group based in Amsterdam that is supplying the pills, Women on Web, a nonprofit staffed by doctors helping women from countries where abortion is illegal or restricted to terminate unwanted pregnancies. Even with the increase in demand for abortion pills, the number of orders received by Women on Web from Latin America and the Caribbean in that time period was small: slightly more than 2,300 in the region, with about 1,600 of those in countries where health authorities had warned about Zika's potential to cause brain damage. In the countries where Zika warnings were issued, there are typically about 3.5 million abortions per year, said Gilda Sedgh, the principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health research organization which was not involved in the study.

The numbers could be ""an early warning sign"" of increased demand for abortion because of Zika, Dr. Sedgh said, adding that it is also possible that Women on Web ""might have experienced an increase in demand as a result of increased visibility of their services when health advisories were issued."" Access to abortion has been a contentious issue for years in many of the countries affected by Zika, but Zika has brought fresh attention to the debate. In Latin America and the Caribbean, according to a recent study, there are about 6.5 million abortions each year. Most of them are illegal, and an estimated 750,000 women a year are treated for complications from unsafe abortions in the region, Dr. Sedgh said. Women's rights groups have long pressed for abortion restrictions to be eased. The study looked at orders for pills between Nov. 17, 2015, when the Pan American Health Organization issued an alert saying Zika virus might be linked to a surge in infants born with tiny heads and damaged brains in Brazil, and March 2 of this year.

It compared actual orders to the number that would have been expected based on orders during the previous five years. Women on Web has a history of defying legal restrictions in such countries, which sometimes block access to its website or seize the packages it sends. The nonprofit also asks women unable to pay for their prescription to write an email explaining why they needed the abortion pill and could not afford it. ""Some of the emails that came in were heartbreaking,"" said Dr. Abigail R.A. Aiken, a reproductive health researcher at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas, Austin, and the lead author of the study. ""The fear and desperation was really hard to read.""

A woman from Venezuela wrote, ""I contracted Zika 4 days ago,"" adding: ""I love children. But I don't believe it is a wise decision to keep a baby who will suffer. I need an abortion. I don't know who to turn to. Please help me ASAP!"" An email from a woman in Colombia said, ""Here Zika is a major problem and the health authorities do not help with it."" She added: ""I have no resources at this time and want to ask for your help because fear overwhelms me. What if the baby is born sick?!""","Orders rose from 36 to 76 percent in nations where the disease is causing babies to be born with tiny heads and damaged brains, a new study says.",e71dabf1-350b-547a-aef3-45fe79a38c9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/06/23/science/23ZIKAABORTION/23ZIKAABORTION-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=025f6a4922797d8991fe9f753ef80249ed9ec8cb358d5c0b98e51ba09e6e7b4b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mifepristone, also known as RU 486, is a pill that induces an abortion.

Books,Utility Worker No. 6691 on Life Inside a Steel Mill,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/03/books/review/rust-memoir-steel-and-grit-eliese-colette-goldbach.html,"Everyone who grows up in Cleveland is familiar with the sight of the orange flame that burns over the steel mill in the industrial valley along the Cuyahoga River. In ""Rust: A Memoir of Steel and Grit,"" Eliese Colette Goldbach describes working under that flame -- the ""flare stack"" -- beginning with the day in the spring of 2016 when she pulls into the parking lot and becomes Utility Worker No. 6691. The mill is a vast dystopian landscape, ""a grisly amusement park,"" with chimneys jutting up at freakish angles, crumbling concrete, stairways to nowhere, gantry cranes, catwalks -- and everything, even the workers in their jumpsuits and hard hats, is covered in dust. The noise is thunderous, and the place stinks, too. But the pay is good, and the new recruits are made to feel as if they'd won the lottery.

""Rust"" has elements of Tara Westover's ""Educated,"" but Goldbach's background is not as extreme. She went to Catholic schools and asked the Blessed Virgin Mary for a sign that she should become a nun. Her father was a conservative and a gun owner but not a fanatic. He ran a pawnshop, and one of the items in the pawnshop that pleased young Eliese most was a toilet seat made of pennies. All this rings true to my own experience, two generations earlier, growing up Catholic on the West Side of Cleveland -- except the toilet seat. My idea of art was a holographic image of Christ, in a drugstore window, that flickered back and forth between the Crucifixion and the Resurrection.

There were times, while reading ""Rust,"" when I wanted to shout at the author, like a kid at a horror movie, ""No! Don't open that door!"" The first time was at her decision to go to graduate school in English, which left her painting houses and living in a dump. It was the struggle to pay off her student loans that prompted her to apply for a job at the steel mill. Goldbach is interested in the chemistry of steelmaking, but she swiftly comes to understand that ""most steelworkers didn't know how steel was made. ... Everyone knew the few steps they were personally responsible for."" In the breakrooms, the ""shanties, booths, and pulpits"" in the mill where the employees could go to warm up or cool off, she listens as the old-timers exchange stories, often about people who were crushed when a coil flipped (finished sheets of steel are rolled into coils) or a forklift toppled. At one point, Goldbach trains in the Hot Dip Galvanizing Line, skimming dross off a vat of molten zinc. If you had the misfortune to fall in -- and it had happened -- it could ""cook you alive.""

I also flinched at her original choice of college: the Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio. Many memoirs have at their heart a trauma that must be approached obliquely and transformed into a turning point. During her first semester away, Goldbach, drunk and possibly drugged at a party, was raped by two upstanding young men, and everything she did in the aftermath -- confide in a friend, confess to a priest, report to the institutional authorities -- had the worst possible outcome. She tells us at the outset that she has a genetic and biological propensity for bipolar disorder, and it is in Steubenville that it emerges. Unhinged, she returns to Cleveland.","Struggling to pay off her student loans, Eliese Colette Goldbach applied for a job as a steelworker.

Health,Hunting the Genetic Signs of Postpartum Depression With an iPhone App,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/22/health/postpartum-depression-genetics-iphone-app.html,"Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the University of North Carolina's perinatal psychiatry program and leader of a project that will use a new iPhone app to recruit women who have had postpartum depression for a study of the disorder's genetic underpinnings.

With mothers and medical providers clamoring for answers about postpartum depression, scientists are beginning a major effort to understand the genetic underpinnings of mood disorders that afflict millions of women during and after pregnancy. Researchers led by a University of North Carolina team will use a new iPhone app to recruit women who have had postpartum depression. The goal is to collect about 100,000 DNA samples and compare them with DNA from women who have never experienced depression in hopes of discovering genetic factors that could lead to better prediction, diagnosis and treatment for maternal mental illness. Attempts to find clear genetic clues to depression in the general population have yielded few results so far, and some experts questioned whether the new effort, announced Monday, would be any more promising. But the team's theory is that postpartum depression may be distinct, involving genes with more identifiable effects because they act during or soon after pregnancy.

The free app, PPD ACT, will be offered in the United States, Australia and Britain, and is likely to be extended to other countries, said Dr. Samantha Meltzer-Brody, director of the University of North Carolina's perinatal psychiatry program and the project's leader. ""To make sure this is not just a study of iPhone-using people,"" Dr. Meltzer-Brody said, iPad versions of the app will be available in some urban and rural clinics, and patients who want to provide their DNA will ""right then and there be offered a spit kit."" The app, to be promoted by Apple as an expansion of its ResearchKit software for medical data collection, poses questions about sadness, anxiety or panic after childbirth in an effort to assess whether women have experienced serious postpartum depression. Women with high scores are asked if they want to submit DNA; if so, they will be mailed a kit to donate their saliva. Names and email addresses will be required, Dr. Meltzer-Brody said, but the project will encrypt personal data. Once enough samples are collected, ""each will be individually genotyped for something like 600,000 genetic markers scattered throughout the genome,"" Dr. Sullivan said. The comparison group will be demographically similar women who have been pregnant at least twice but never experienced depression. ""Are there regions of the genome where women with postpartum depression differ systematically from women without?"" Dr. Sullivan asked. Anjene Addington, chief of the genomics research branch at the National Institute of Mental Health, which is providing the kits to collect saliva, said the project aimed to collect thousands of DNA samples from a diverse group of women.

""As we learn more about genetic research on psychiatric disorders, we know that we need huge, huge numbers of participants,"" she said. Compared with many physical illnesses, the genetics of psychiatric disorders have so far proved complex and elusive to understand. Even one of the most heritable disorders, schizophrenia, appears linked to small variations in more than a hundred genetic regions. Recently, though, a genetic variant has been identified that seems to ignite excessive pruning of synapses in a key brain area in people with schizophrenia. Depression has been one of the toughest to figure out, partly because it affects different people in different ways. ""You might have an 18-year-old woman who is doing self-cutting and she's got depression,"" Dr. Sullivan said, ""and a 64-year-old woman with hypertension and Type 2 diabetes and she's got depression."" Because postpartum depression afflicts a narrower group of women who have recently given birth, it may be easier to study, Dr. Sullivan said. He said he and some colleagues had recently conducted a study that suggested postpartum depression was more heritable than general depression. Dr. Addington said there might be genes that specifically influence a woman's sensitivity to hormonal fluctuations in pregnancy.

But David Goldstein, director of Columbia University's Institute for Genomic Medicine, who is not involved in the project, said another possibility was that postpartum depression's links to hormonal fluctuations, in addition to emotional and other stresses that can accompany having children, might indicate it was ""less likely to be genetic."" He said he had no objection to the project's goal, but ""it's possible that you can collect information from tens of thousands of individuals and not find anything."" Dr. Kenneth S. Kendler, director of psychiatric genetics research at Virginia Commonwealth University, who is not involved in the project, said some evidence suggested that genes involved in postpartum depression differed somewhat from those in general depression. Ideally, the project will find ""fewer gene variants involved and they are bigger in effect size,"" he said.","Scientists hope to use a cellphone app to recruit 100,000 women to submit DNA samples to try to identify genes that may be markers for postpartum depression.",04e0aa63-2e4f-5f47-b3e5-961eb538db75,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/22/health/22postpartum_comp/22postpartum_comp-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=513&w=981&s=d249579751587e97ac3a1496b702ad0cd93ec572dacf6815774e9065e5735526&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"These are images from the PPD ACT app, which poses questions about sadness, anxiety or panic after childbirth in an effort to assess whether women have experienced serious postpartum depression.",04e0aa63-2e4f-5f47-b3e5-961eb538db75,N24News/imgs/04e0aa63-2e4f-5f47-b3e5-961eb538db75.jpg,1
Style,Alison Mosshart of the Kills Makes Jarring Paintings,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/05/style/alison-mosshart-of-the-kills-makes-jarring-paintings.html,"Alison Mosshart at Joseph Gross Gallery, where her show will be on view through July 11.

There was something grotesque if not downright alarming about the portraits on the wall. Strangers encountered during concert tours, they glared glassy-eyed from the canvas, grinning with stained teeth as crumbly and neglected as a tumbledown fence. So it was jarring when Alison Mosshart, the artist, strolled into the Joseph Gross Gallery in Chelsea last month, a study in cleareyed serenity, her glossy hair cascading to her shoulders, her creamy skin spotless except for the discreet tattoo on her wrist commemorating her first concert with her long-term musical partner, the British rocker Jamie Hince. Ms. Mosshart, the 36-year-old front woman for the Kills, is a raucous performer, fashion idol and, when she is on the road between concerts, a painter, crazily streaking chalks and acrylics onto canvases compact enough to fit into her suitcase. On the eve of her first solo exhibition, which runs through July 11, she said: ""Over the years my art box has gotten bigger and bigger. I do have to sacrifice clothing space.""

Not much of a sacrifice, it turns out, since she tends to stick to a rocker uniform, swapping her biker coat on balmy days for the denim vest she wore the other night. ""I'm a practical person,"" she said. ""This is my summertime version of a leather jacket."" That vest, covered in trinkets and amulets (an evil eye, a silver monogram pin), teemed with pockets jammed to bursting with necessities, among them a pack of American Spirits, a drivers' license, and the old-fashioned BlackBerry she carries like a talisman. She is far less attached to her artworks, she said, turning her back on them the moment the last daub of paint has dried. ""Painting is almost like a sport,"" she said. ""It's like this action thing. When I do it, I'm really not thinking. The paintings are like a diary that I might not want to read again."" She was happy enough, though, to review her work with a visitor, ushering her guest toward a wall on which hung a compact portrait of a towheaded boy, inscribed with the legend ""Stingray."" According to Ms. Mosshart, they were in Escondido, Calif. ""We got there last New Years and there was a young kid -- I think I made him blond -- and he was telling us about the dangers on the beach,"" she said. ""One of them was a stingray.""

""Electrified Reach,"" another disquieting piece, which is dated June 11, 2014, showed a swarm of helicopters, blades whirring, hovering wasplike over western Los Angeles. ""To me, that's the soundtrack of L.A.,"" she said. For sure her paintings can be terrifying. As soothing, or as strident, as her music, they are meant to get under your skin, she said. During a recent tour, Ms. Mosshart befriended the 2-year-old daughter of one of the engineers. ""Fierce girl,"" she said. ""She would critique all my paintings as scary or not scary, and go for the ones that were frightening. She was my best critic."" She talks about her creative process with a disarming self-awareness. In interviews, she has somewhat bizarrely confided that she trusts her eyes more than her ears. ""I write music visually,"" she said the other night. ""Jamie is always saying 'You use so many adjectives.' But I can't help it."" When she writes, as when she paints, ""I'm trying to use every color every jagged edge, every surface,"" she said. ""There's a scene that's being created in my head and you are meant to walk into it."" As if on cue, at that instant Ms. Mosshart's family -- her mop-topped brother Matthew; her father, Mark, a car salesman; and her mother, Vivian, a high school art teacher whom Ms. Mosshart credits as her greatest influence -- materialized.","The singer thinks of art as ""almost like a sport.""",f4801162-fb38-5671-99f1-aaf6083e84a3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/02/fashion/05NIGHTOUT/05NIGHTOUT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=ed842de8c86c9ea37fdde2efc91987b05ba26ddddacfe884015b1c5f3e4abb5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Alison Mosshart at Joseph Gross Gallery, where her show will be on view through July 11.",f4801162-fb38-5671-99f1-aaf6083e84a3,N24News/imgs/f4801162-fb38-5671-99f1-aaf6083e84a3.jpg,15
Economy,A Weak Jobs Report Poses a New Challenge to Trump: A Slowing Economy,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/07/business/economy/may-jobs-report-economy.html,"Lawmakers, business executives and economists have all tried to warn President Trump that his trade policies could hurt growth. On Friday, the government reported that employers added just 75,000 jobs in May, a fact that will be hard for him to ignore. The increase was a far cry from what economists had expected and a fraction of the number of jobs created in April. The weakness was most evident in sectors that depend on exports, and analysts were quick to blame Mr. Trump's tariffs on China and other countries.

""This should be a clear warning to the administration and the Federal Reserve to tread very carefully on the policy front,"" said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco . ""The May jobs report gives us a taste of what's ahead if these trade threats continue."" The economy started the year strong, expanding by 3.1 percent in the first quarter, and the payroll figures don't suggest that a downturn is imminent. The current recovery has defied recession predictions several times, and this month it tied a record for longevity with the boom of the 1990s.

Nor was the news all bad. Unemployment was unchanged at 3.6 percent, the lowest that number has been in about 50 years. And average hourly earnings increased by 0.2 percent, which was less than expected but better than earlier in the recovery. Mr. Trump's announcement late Friday that he was suspending a plan to impose new tariffs on Mexico, which would have taken effect Monday, should help ease concerns about rising trade tensions.

Monthly jobs data can be volatile, with big swings already in January, February and March of this year. But the slow pace of hiring in May followed other disappointing indicators. Oil prices and yields on Treasury bonds have both plunged, which suggests traders expect slower growth. The huge corporate tax cut enacted in late 2017 served as a tailwind for the economy in 2018 and early 2019, but the impact is beginning to fade. In the first five months of 2019, the economy added an average of 164,000 jobs, down from an average gain of 223,000 for all of 2018. What's more, retail sales and factory orders declined in April, an indication that consumers and businesses are becoming more cautious. The jobs report on Friday also revised down hiring data in March and April by 75,000. ""Over all, the economy is on a fragile footing,"" said Lindsey Piegza , chief economist at the investment bank Stifel. ""We're still talking about solid growth at the start of the year, but that's in the rearview mirror. The name of the game is uncertainty."" At big companies, tariffs are the leading cause of those jitters. The Trump administration has been putting pressure on China for months, but tensions increased last month when negotiators failed to reach a deal and the administration raised tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. President Trump threatened Mexico with tariffs on May 30, when he said the administration would place a 5 percent duty on imports from that country to compel it to halt the flow of Central American immigrants to the United States.

While that decision is sure to please many businesses, the duties the administration has placed on China and other countries have already forced large manufacturers, home contractors and other businesses to pay higher prices for components and basic materials. Analysts believe that businesses will eventually have to pass these higher costs on to consumers by raising prices.

* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""It may not lead to firing but it may cause businesses to postpone hiring,"" said Michelle Meyer , chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch . Ms. Meyer's economic forecast calls for growth to slow to less than 1.5 percent in the second half of the year . In the current quarter, she estimates the economy will grow by 1.9 percent; other analysts think growth will be closer to 1 percent. She has been keeping a close eye on job creation in the goods sector, relative to hiring in service industries. ""If global weakness or the trade war filters in, it's going to have a bigger impact on the goods side of the economy,"" she said.

Retaliatory tariffs imposed by other countries have also made American exports less competitive on world markets. It's perhaps not surprising, then, that factory employment is up just 30,000 this year, compared with a gain of 110,000 in the first five months of last year. Hiring in sectors like manufacturing and mining and logging slowed to a crawl in May, while the services sector showed vigor. The professional and business services category added 33,000 jobs, and health care added 24,000. The retail sector, battered by the rise of e-commerce, lost jobs for the fourth month in a row. Employment in the sector has dropped by 50,000 since January. On Friday, the latest numbers prompted economists on Wall Street to predict the Fed would cut interest rates as soon as next month.

Fashion & Style,"Men's Wear, Poetically: Rick Owens, Raf Simons, Dries Van Noten and Louis Vuitton",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/23/fashion/mens-style/rick-owens-raf-simons-louis-vuitton-paris-mens-fashion-fall-2016.html,"PARIS -- Fashion has a serious case of narrative mania. Designers and their fans alike are so stoned on storytelling and the seductions of reference that one starts to yearn for the preliterate -- or pre-Internet, anyway -- world. On paper, at least, Rick Owens's show on Friday -- held in the underbelly of the Palais de Tokyo here and titled ""Mastodon"" -- had to do with eco-anxiety, woolly mammoths, an obscure 1960s Italian horror movie and the beekeeping that his wife, Michele Lamy, recently took up as a hobby. Raf Simons, in his first foray since leaving Dior, mounted his own fine and clearly liberating show by citing a welter of sources so varied that his show notes read like outtakes from a poetry slam. To wit: For good measure, Mr. Simons threw in Martin Margiela, Cindy Sherman, the Boy Scouts, CBGB and ""The Breakfast Club."" He also revisited his own back pages by evoking the influential ""Fear Generation"" collection for spring 2002 that first put him on the map.

Put that in your big bubble and smoke it. At Louis Vuitton, the designer Kim Jones averred that he had been inspired by the life of the self-mythologizing Parisian playboy dandy Alexis von Rosenberg, a man with a whopper of a back story and the first person, as Mr. Jones said, ""I ever Google-searched."" Fetching up in Paris in the late middle years of the 20th century, the man styled as the third baron de Rede first acquired a married Chilean boyfriend whose enormous family fortune had been made in guano; then, through him, the embrace of a fashionable French society; and not long thereafter, an immense apartment in the 18th-century Hotel Lambert, possibly the grandest private house in Paris. Eventually, he took a job.

""He managed my father's money,"" Jade Jagger said backstage during a brief preview of the cobwebby silver and diamond heritage style jewelry she designed to accompany the collection. That is, it was de Rede who introduced her father, Mick Jagger, to Rupert zu Loewenstein, the Spanish-born Bavarian prince who eventually came to manage the Rolling Stones' money so cannily that, as Ms. Jagger also noted, ""He made them all very rich."" Baron de Rede's credentials are more entertaining when you learn that they were largely fictitious. The fashionable set has always gone for a good story, and Baron de Rede's was ripe enough to obscure his true origins as a middle-class adventurer from upstate Troy, N.Y.

Taken together, these were four of the more poetically rendered shows in recent memory. Each in its own way helped set a course not just for men's wear, but for fashion as a force beneficial to culture. It is decidedly not in the nature of the French to publicly dwell on disaster, yet few here were unaffected by the Nov. 13 terrorist attacks in Paris. Thus, as notable as the security measures instituted at various show spaces throughout the city is the psychic bulwark these designers provided through optimistic visions of Paris's creative future. In Mr. Owens's case, vision took the form of clothes in immense volumes, cargo trousers with pockets as big as panniers alternated with shrunken, tailored jackets or boiler suits that looked paint-splattered. There were sculptural garments of no known category sprouting sleeves as if for vestigial limbs. That the sleeves were tied back into the body of the garments, straitjacket-style, reminded a viewer that controlling the fundamental unruliness of human bodies is among Mr. Owens's continuing concerns. You can see it in his assiduously crafted physique, and in virtually everything he has ever designed.","The designers reveled in fashion's storytelling trend, offering both clothes and long lists of inspirations.",9b616769-451a-5390-a644-dd3a89ecce4b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/23/fashion/23homme-F/23homme-F-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=1621880636800f33517cb84ee9c753f9cbc3f1a58451a8f941ca26fcf57b84cd&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A look from ""Mastodon,"" the Rick Owens collection for fall 2016.",9b616769-451a-5390-a644-dd3a89ecce4b,N24News/imgs/9b616769-451a-5390-a644-dd3a89ecce4b.jpg,19
Economy,"White House Warns Against Chinese Investment, Citing Risk of Further Sanctions",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/07/business/economy/white-house-chinese-investment.html,"WASHINGTON -- White House officials on Tuesday warned a federally administered retirement plan for railroad workers against investing in Chinese companies and said that additional sanctions could be on the way in return for China's role in spreading the coronavirus.

The national security adviser, Robert C. O'Brien, and the director of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow, told the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board in a letter that its investments in China were exposing retirees to ""unnecessary economic risk"" and channeling funds into companies ""that raise significant national security and humanitarian concerns,"" including some that supply the Chinese Army.

The White House officials said it was ""a time of mounting uncertainty"" over China's relations with the rest of the world that presented ""the possibility of future sanctions or boycotts that may arise from a wide range of issues, including the culpable actions of the Chinese government with respect to the global spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, the suppression of Hong Kong's democracy,"" and other factors.

The warning comes amid worsening ties between the world's two largest economies, which have frayed as the administration continues to blame China for not doing enough to contain the virus. But even before the pandemic, the Trump administration was considering taking a tougher stance on the investments that have knit together American and Chinese financial markets.","Economic and security officials warned a federal fund against putting retirement savings in China at ""a time of mounting uncertainty"" for the relationship.",a513bd67-b605-53dc-a9b2-3363fc9b409f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/07/us/politics/07dc-chinainvest/07dc-chinainvest-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=20da15787c536f70e577603064b2772ffa7ba29f98cbd292c8f78d113e6396ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"White House officials, including economic adviser Larry Kudlow, told the U.S. Railroad Retirement Board that its investments in China were exposing retirees to ""unnecessary economic risk.""",a513bd67-b605-53dc-a9b2-3363fc9b409f,N24News/imgs/a513bd67-b605-53dc-a9b2-3363fc9b409f.jpg,8
Your Money,The 21 Questions You're Going to Need to Ask About Investment Fees,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/10/your-money/the-21-questions-youre-going-to-need-to-ask-about-investment-fees.html,"So much hand-wringing over such a simple proposition: When a financial professional gives you advice about the life savings in your retirement account, that person ought to act in your best interest. It took several years for this so-called fiduciary rule to gain approval -- firms are supposed to begin following the new rules in April -- thanks to pushback from people in the financial services industry. And then, in the course of a week, we've seen President Trump tell the Labor Department to study this uncontroversial (and already much-studied) proposition, which he wants to upend. A few days later came a big loss for industry players who challenged the legitimacy of the rule in Texas, where a federal judge ruled against them. But let's put the focus back where it belongs: not on politics or the law, but on you. The best way to understand what the fiduciary debate is about -- and to protect yourself -- is to view this discussion through the lens of fees. Every time you do business with people in the financial services industry, ask them this: How much money are you making, and what are the different ways you are making it?

If only there were a simple answer to this question all of the time. All of this fiduciary wrangling got started in large part because there has rarely been a simple answer in many parts of the industry. ""The fiduciary rule ultimately comes down to the fact that some people are making a lot of money at the expense of other people who have no idea how much their adviser is getting paid,"" said Lynn M. Dunston, who runs a financial planning firm in Denver, where the only fees he earns come directly from clients. The best (and by far, the funniest) explanation I've seen of what a fiduciary is and does comes from a video that a firm called HighTower Advisors posted on YouTube in 2012. There, they compare butchers and nutritionists. Butchers push meat, perhaps the best meat they have. Nutritionists, however, tell you what is best to eat, period, because they have your best overall health interests at heart and have no stake in how much meat you consume. When seeking advice on your life savings, presumably you would want to speak to the nutritionists and not the butchers. But the butchers of the financial world are in a pretty good spot right now. After all, we have just seen eight years of stock market gains. With an unpredictable new president in the White House, people have reason to be wary. So enter the annuity peddlers, and others touting safety, protections from downside risk, guarantees and the possibility of participating in future market gains, too. And wouldn't you know it? The way these salespeople sold those products during the last downturn was a big part of what pushed the proponents of the fiduciary rule to act.

You will be seeing these pitches soon enough, and when you do, there is a long list of questions you must ask. In fact, anytime anyone is trying to sell you an actively managed mutual fund, a real estate investment trust, or REIT, that you don't understand or anything else even remotely confusing, hit them with each and every one of the following questions: How much money will you personally make in cash commission, now, if I select this product? And how much will you make later, in any sort of ongoing or trailing commission? Is there a bonus you are eligible for that comes as a result of your recruitment to this firm? Is it in jeopardy if you don't make this sale?
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' Are you earning more from selling me this product than you might from putting me in a similar product from a different company? Are you earning more than you might if you put me in a different vehicle from the same company? Is your company or the company that created this product running any contests that might lead to you getting to take a free trip if I buy this product? (For a fun virtual tour of the places your salesperson might go, see the two reports that Senator Elizabeth Warren has put out in the last couple of years.) And while we are discussing trips, do any of the companies that you work with offer ""due diligence"" trips? You know, the ones where you spend an hour learning about the products and 10 hours drinking and golfing? ""My wife reads on Facebook that one of our mutual friends is down in Orlando at a fixed annuities conference,"" said Patrick Rush, who sold annuities in a former life and is now a financial planner in Greensboro, N.C. ""She's like, 'What is going on? How come you don't win anything?' "" Now, what about other forms of payment, say in points that you might redeem for merchandise? Mr. Dunston of Denver once sold annuities before he came upon what he describes as a better way to help clients (and his blog post on the journey is well worth a read). After a couple of big sales more than a decade ago, he had earned enough credits to exchange them for a diamond ring for his wife worth about $3,500. The annuity provider, Allianz, told me that a thorough search of its records did not yield information that confirmed Mr. Dunston's story, but Mr. Dunston said that it may have been a third party that ran the incentive program, and that he is certain he earned those points and that spiffy ring through Allianz. ""You can see why advisers might be conflicted about offering something like this versus a low-cost index fund,"" he said. ""But I really thought I was doing the right thing at the time.""

More questions! Do you get to eat lots of free food? Mr. Rush, the Greensboro planner, well remembers all of the so-called plate-licker seminars he once attended at Ruth's Chris, the steak house chain, courtesy of various financial services companies. How about hoops tickets in basketball-mad parts of the country? ""There were certainly people who could provide Carolina or Duke seats,"" he said. ""You knew who to call. They weren't going to be putting you up in the nosebleed seats either."" Then, there is some nitty-gritty. You will be offered all sorts of product features and extras, and you will need to ask the following questions: How much extra will I pay in fees (or how much might I sacrifice in returns or payouts) if I elect to receive a sign-up bonus on my annuity? Or for a guaranteed minimum income or benefit if I elect to take my money in monthly payments starting at some later date? What if I want a death benefit for my heirs? Are there specific charges for the insurance component of the product? Are there any penalties for pulling my money out early? As for any subaccounts in my annuity, are there expense ratios or fees for the money there? A separate management fee? Trading fees? A record-keeping or other administrative fee? Please provide me an itemized list for any and all fees, thank you! Finally, does your firm stand to collect any fees that you yourself will not share in as part of your commission because they have favored one product or another or limited their platform to certain products and locked out others? There is no right answer to these questions, not exactly anyway. Some annuities can be useful (especially the simple fixed, immediate ones and similar products known as longevity insurance), and in some other cases you may get what you pay for in peace of mind. But many other annuities may cost 3.5 percent annually when you add up all of the fees. For about one-third of that or even less in some cases, you can find a fiduciary adviser who will give you all-you-can-eat advice on every aspect of your financial life and put you in solid (if boring, and simple) investments that cost a tiny fraction of what many annuities do. It's anyone's guess how much regulators will ultimately be looking out for you. All Jillian B. Rogers, a Labor Department spokeswoman, would say was that it is exploring options to delay the applicability date for the fiduciary rule. And she would not explain on the record why the department removed an explainer on the rule from its website recently, though an archived version is pretty easy to find.",Are financial advisers trying to part you from your money in ways you don't understand?

Fashion & Style,David Barton Reinvents His Gym Empire,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/03/10/fashion/david-barton-tmpl-reinvents-his-gym-empire.html,"""I'm dressed for a construction site, so pardon my casual presentation,"" David Barton said one recent Friday afternoon in Hell's Kitchen. But his appearance was classic Barton: ripped jeans, mesh hoodie that exposed his ""George of the Jungle"" pecs, camouflage robe, hair spiking every which way. As he spoke, the sinews of his neck occasionally twitched, making his squarish frame seem like a TNT box about to detonate. At 51, the man who built a sweaty, sexy gym empire stands as a 5-foot-5 testament to body worship as urban religion. So it's no surprise that his new gym, TMPL, has a name that evokes a pagan ritual crossed with an iPhone app. (His 21-year-old son, Bailey, came up with the name Temple, but ""I decided to lose the vowels to make it more modern,"" he said. ) Set to open March 23 on West 49th Street, the fitness center is his first since leaving his namesake company under a financial cloud. ""I like that my name's not on the door,"" he said. But there wasn't much of a choice. When Mr. Barton left David Barton Gym in 2013, he forfeited the rights to his name after spending two decades making it synonymous with a gym-as-nightclub aesthetic.

As beefy impresario, Mr. Barton was often said to be a better mascot than manager. In early 2011, saddled with more than $65 million in debt, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, even as three locations were being built. Both he and the company say the breakup was mutual. ""I'd been there 20 years,"" Mr. Barton said. ""It was time. I didn't enjoy being the corporate C.E.O."" His resurgence, which comes, fittingly, on the heels of Rocky Balboa's, is as attuned to the moment as his Chelsea and Astor Place locations were to the downtown party scene they mirrored. The largely gay crowd that flocked to David Barton Gym has migrated to Hell's Kitchen. TMPL is also being billed as a ""smart gym"": high-tech and customizable, like a self-parking car (or a hookup app like Grindr). Publicity materials even borrow the jargon of Silicon Valley, touting Mr. Barton as a ""disrupter and visionary within the gym industry.""

Capitalizing on the rise of celebrity trainers and personalized medicine, Mr. Barton worked with the clinical pharmacist and author James LaValle to develop a metabolic assessment for incoming gym members so that all will get individually tailored workout and nutritional plans. ""Everything in our lives is getting smart except the gym,"" he said. ""My phone knows when I'm hungry and it calls my mother."" Mr. Barton, who studied nutrition and psychology at Cornell, is accustomed to combining brains and brawn. ""For all his downtown high jinks, David is quite serious in many ways,"" said William Sofield of the design firm Studio Sofield, which worked on TMPL and several David Barton Gym sites. ""David at heart is very much an intellectual bordering on almost a nerd. He could have easily been cast on 'The Big Bang Theory.'"" TMPL occupies a beige-and-salmon-brick building at One Worldwide Plaza that formerly housed a Bally Sports Club -- just the sort of fluorescent-lit fitness chain that Mr. Barton made a career of disrupting. Amid the roar of electric saws, he led a brief tour of the 40,000-square-foot space, describing the constructivist decor to come: concrete walls swathed in cashmere curtains, black-mirror columns and Eileen Gray Bibendum chairs, all in muted and muddy tones, ""like those colors that don't really have a name.""

He descended a staircase into a tall atrium, which will be glammed up with programmable lighting. ""This is your first sort of money shot,"" he said. ""A lot of gyms do lighting and it's like when you open up the refrigerator in the middle of the night."" He pointed out a future cardio room, a squat-rack room (""a lot of women now are squatting because of, like, social media"") and a spinning room that will immerse patrons in an IMAX-like virtual landscape.

And then there are the sexier elements: an 82-foot saltwater pool and locker rooms that Mr. Barton promised would get ""darker, with more dramatic lighting."" But he played down his reputation for creating gyms that resemble nightclubs. ""David Barton Gym was me at 27,"" he said, ""and this is me at 51."" Part of Mr. Barton's post-50 life is his return to semi-singlehood. For years, he and Susanne Bartsch, the Swiss party hostess, represented one of New York's most outre power couples. With her outrageous wigs and his outrageous biceps, they were like a punked-out Boris and Natasha. Known for her Dionysian blowouts at the Copacabana in the 1980s, Ms. Bartsch took time off to raise Bailey before resuming her role as a bedazzled queen of the night.","The muscle-bound man who pioneered the gym-as-nightclub aesthetic is set to open a new fitness center, TMPL, in Hell's Kitchen.",077cb2da-8395-59b7-a2f5-84025eda2ed5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/03/09/fashion/10BARTON2/10BARTON2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=090146d4c0b9983ca28d3c326294b316f235ad564e8a48a4a1f0638e538c119b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"David Barton inside his new gym, TMPL, in Hell's Kitchen.",077cb2da-8395-59b7-a2f5-84025eda2ed5,N24News/imgs/077cb2da-8395-59b7-a2f5-84025eda2ed5.jpg,19
Real Estate,Former Home to Michael Jackson and Marc Chagall Sells for $32 Million,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/realestate/former-home-to-michael-jackson-and-marc-chagall-sells-for-32-million.html,"A six-story, Beaux-Arts mansion on the Upper East Side that was home to several prominent occupants, starting with President Grover Cleveland's law partner and including the artist Marc Chagall and the pop star Michael Jackson, has sold for nearly $32 million. It was the most expensive closed sale in the month of October, according to New York City property records. The seller, noteworthy in his own right, was Marc Lasry, the billionaire hedge fund manager and co-owner of the N.B.A.'s Milwaukee Bucks. He and his wife, Cathy Lasry, had listed the house at 4 East 74th Street about a year ago for $39 million, then recently lowered it to $35 million. They bought it in 2001 for $11 million. The new owner appeared to be Michael Thomas Danson, the chief executive of GlobalData, a digital media company based in London. Public records show Mr. Danson took out a $15 million mortgage on the home.

This wasn't the only property that sold for more than $30 million last month. Several blocks away, at the new condominium tower at 520 Park Avenue, at 60th Street, a full-floor apartment was acquired for $31.5 million by an unknown buyer. The sponsor unit, No. 36, has about 4,600 square feet, with four bedrooms, five baths and views of Central Park. The limestone building, designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, was developed by Zeckendorf Development; closings began in early September. Nearby, Vornado Realty Trust's 220 Central Park South, near 58th Street -- another limestone tower designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects -- had its first official closing last month: a three-bedroom, three-bath unit on the 26th floor that sold for $14.6 million. In other notable October transactions, Alexander von Furstenberg, the son of the fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg and the Swiss-born aristocrat Egon von Furstenberg, bought an apartment at 432 Park Avenue.

The billionaire hedge fund manager William Ackman deeded yet another apartment, in SoHo, to his former wife, Karen Ackman, as part of an apparent property settlement. Also, Nancy Moonves, the ex-wife of Leslie Moonves, the ousted CBS chief executive, traded one Upper East Side co-op for another around the corner. And in Chelsea, the screenwriters Henry Bean and Leora Barish sold a townhouse with a private yoga studio. The limestone-and-red brick mansion on East 74th Street, sold by Mr. Lasry, sits on one of the neighborhood's most desired streets, between Fifth and Madison Avenues. It was designed at the turn of the 20th century by Alexander Welch and built for Francis Lynde Stetson and his wife, Elizabeth Ruff Stetson. Stetson was a law partner with Grover Cleveland between Cleveland's two split terms as president. Over the years, many residents have come and gone from the mansion, including Chagall, who lived on the top floor with his wife, the writer Bella Chagall, shortly after arriving in New York in 1941. They decorated their apartment with his artwork. Jackson rented the house for six months, from August 1999 to February 2000. (The asking rent was $75,000 a month in 1998.) The building also has been featured on the big and small screens. It appeared in the 1991 film ""The Prince of Tides,"" starring Barbra Streisand, and more recently, had a recurring role in the ""Gossip Girl"" TV series that ran from 2007 to 2012. The stately structure is 25 feet wide, with nearly 12,750 square feet of interior space including seven bedrooms, eight full baths, two half baths and staff quarters in the finished basement. Although the home was extensively renovated, many original architectural flourishes remain, like the high ceilings, detailed oak staircase, 10 wood-burning fireplaces, and wood floors, paneling and moldings. The exterior includes a private roof deck and a patio on the garden level. Monthly taxes are nearly $10,000. Adam D. Modlin and Nina Tkachuk Perez of the Modlin Group were the listing brokers; Mr. Modlin also represented the buyer.",The Upper East Side mansion on East 74th Street was New York City's biggest closing in October.

Dance,Dance This Week: From Modern to Tango to Flamenco,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/17/arts/dance/dance-this-week-from-modern-to-tango-to-flamenco.html,"This matters. For decades until 2015, the Taylor enterprise has had a big New York season each spring - almost always dancing work exclusively by Mr. Taylor, under the name Paul Taylor Dance Company. No other one-choreographer troupe was as popular across America. After the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, no modern-dance troupe has a stronger presence in New York; and, like Ailey, the Taylor dancers also tour nationally and internationally. This spring, however, the Taylor season was called Paul Taylor's American Modern Dance and also contained two other modern-dance companies performing works by their own choreographers (one older and dead, one younger and alive). Only during that season, however, did a few of us begin to understand that the Taylor dancers are still called Paul Taylor Dance Company. It is the Paul Taylor Dance Company that continues to tour America and abroad. Only in New York - where the company has its home - and only in the spring seasons at the Koch can you see Paul Taylor's American Modern Dance. And these distinctions arise because Mr. Taylor, 85 and still choreographing two pieces a year, is preparing his company for a post-Taylor world. The 2016 Koch season also brings two other premieres, by the choreographers Doug Elkins and Larry Keigwin; it is they who appear with the Taylor dancers this weekend, showing their new works-in-process. They also converse with the Taylor scholar Suzanne Carbonneau. The insight into the next stage of Taylor operations may be valuable.

Like many tango stars, he's half a nomad, visiting multiple cities, and half a denizen of his native Buenos Aires. He has appeared at City Center's Fall for Dance season (twice) and (a number of times) at the Vail Festival. But tango, for all its intense drama, is not seen best in theaters. It's an art of salons, clubs, studios; and the most breathtaking performances I've seen by Mr. Misse have been at close quarters in dance studios and in tango-friendly restaurants. But it takes two. This Saturday night he dances at the Clemente Soto Velez Cultural and Educational Center with Guillermina Quiroga in a single late-evening performance. It's curious to recall that in 2008 Ms. Quiroga, then partnered by Cesar Coelho, shared that Symphony Space program I saw. She, a beautiful dancer, and Mr. Coelho went in for too many overhead lifts -- but she's elegant, dignified, commanding. It should be fascinating to observe this new partnership. Does she have Mr. Misse's brilliance? Are they a pair?",On the cultural calendars for the week are dance programs of many flavors and traditions.,faed7e0c-a456-5891-83e3-5d8d0c32a79c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/17/arts/dance/17DANCE/17DANCE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=536&w=1024&s=c25faee3327513a6c2f3b3f7732ce116a61a0d1cad8239a618986ef5b649162d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jean Butler performing ""Hurry"" at Danspace in 2013.",faed7e0c-a456-5891-83e3-5d8d0c32a79c,N24News/imgs/faed7e0c-a456-5891-83e3-5d8d0c32a79c.jpg,6
Economy,Newly Frugal Generation Revives Discount Dining,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/09/business/economy/09earlybird.html,"MIAMI BEACH  The early bird special at Cafe Prima Pasta began last year after the restaurant's owner, Gerardo Cea, lost all his savings in real estate and began seeing his regular customers at the supermarket. He expected his offer of a 50 percent discount before 6 p.m. to attract the usual crowd of frugal retirees. But word kept spreading, and on most nights now, at least half the tables are filled with young families, singles or hip couples  women in short skirts and men who prefer ""dude"" to ""sir."" Across Florida in fact, the early-bird special is experiencing a revival. With that label and some newer versions, several restaurants have introduced early dining discounts since the recession started, and younger people are arriving in larger numbers at classic establishments that have been serving up free dessert for decades. Part of it is purely business  promotions work when people have less money to spend  but restaurant owners, researchers and patrons say it also reflects a changing mood. It is a sign, they say, of shifting priorities, as Americans respond to tighter budgets with a demand for value and a willingness to alter their habits to enjoy a little fun.

Many restaurant owners, on Florida's east and west coasts, now report seeing behavioral changes that remind them of the generation that survived the Depression. In addition to coming in early for specials, they said, more customers have been using coupons, sitting down only after studying the menu and wasting less food. ""The value of money has changed in America,"" said James Accursio, whose family has owned the Capri, an Italian restaurant in Florida City, since it opened in 1958. ""We're not high rollers anymore."" His restaurant is one of many experiencing a moment reminiscent of the movie ""Cocoon."" As Mr. Accursio scanned his main dining room on a recent Saturday just before the early bird expired at 6:30, he saw more young faces where only old ones used to be. To his left sat the Dawkins family, ages 47, 33, 23, 8 and 3; by the door, a man with a full head of dark hair checked his iPhone across from his date; and near the back were the Slaters, a family of 11 that crossed demographic lines. Early-bird promotions, long popular with older diners, are now attracting a younger clientele at Cafe Prima Pasta in Miami Beach. Michael Francis Mcelroy for The New York Times Their ages ranged from 80  for Marty Slater, the matriarch, who said she had been coming to the Capri since she moved to Florida in the '50s  down to 19. Economically, it was a middle-class group. On one side of the table sat an architect, a social worker and a manager in manufacturing. And nearly all said they had been hurt by the recession.

As a result, they said, old-fashioned restaurants like the Capri  think iceberg lettuce, not arugula  had become especially appealing because they offered consistent value, and it was not just the early bird's filet mignon for $12.95. It was also the respectful treatment  the waiters in ties, the greetings of ""Mr."" and ""Mrs.,"" the effort to remember the orders of regulars, and letting everyone stay as long as they wanted. ""When you go out now, you have to have a plan,"" said Gary Green, 34, who married into the family after leaving Jamaica. At the Capri, he said, ""there's less risk."" Katherine Slater, the restaurant's only diner with a nose stud and dyed red hair, said she had only recently begun to understand what her elders saw in such places. ""When I was young, 18, I was like, why would I want to go out to dinner there with my parents and my grandparents?"" she said. ""Now I'm 21. I appreciate it."" Nearly everyone in the state feels a little poorer these days  with unemployment at its highest rate since 1975 and real estate values continuing to drop. That insecurity has reshaped the local mindset, say many Floridians under 55, and taken the shame out of scrimping. For instance, Cassandra Eriser, 35, an aesthetician with cover girl looks who works giving facials at a South Beach spa, is not what most people imagine when they think early bird. But there she was at Cafe Prima Pasta on a recent Sunday at 5:30 p.m., finishing up a meal of tilapia with her boyfriend, a musician with a shaved head. With wine and tip, the couple spent less than $25 each. ""It's a great way to try a new restaurant without forking over a lot of money,"" Ms. Eriser said.

A few nights later at Cafe Prima Pasta, the urge to splurge brought out a party of 13. Mostly employees of a nonprofit in their 20s and 30s, they laughed as they explained that they were eating early for a simple reason: ""Because we're broke."" Cafe Prima Pasta offered a 50 percent discount on meals before 6 p.m., expecting to increase its popularity among retirees. Michael Francis Mcelroy for The New York Times At the early bird for Tropical Acres Steakhouse in Fort Lauderdale, which opened in 1949, Edward and Denisa Wainwright said they were celebrating their anniversary there because it was affordable and still felt fancy. ""This reminds us of the New England style,"" said Mr. Wainwright, 55. Even before the dessert cart arrived, he said he was full. A Harvard graduate, he said he taught at Kaplan Test Prep, making half what he used to make at a database company. ""We've had to get used to it,"" Mrs. Wainwright, 52, said. ""We don't go out as much because of the money."" In some circles, of course, the early bird still carries a whiff of mothballs, thus the rebranding. When Benihana tried it last summer in South Florida, they called it ""twilight dining."" At Cafe Baci in Sarasota, which has also seen more young people lately, they use ""early dining."" Hudson Riehle, a senior vice president for research at the National Restaurant Association, said other restaurants around the country had tried ""afternoon dining"" or just ditched the label entirely, using ""prix fixe"" instead. ""The term 'early bird' may be a little dated from a lexicon standpoint, like 'doggy bag,' "" Mr. Riehle said. ""But the concept has been and will continue to be an extremely effective marketing tool for certain restaurants in certain markets.""","In Florida, early-bird specials have expanded beyond frugal retirees as younger diners tighten their budgets.",91324ed9-1b53-5a30-82bf-0ad82433fd77,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/01/09/us/09earlybird_CA0/articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=330&w=600&s=4149b9a965310fbe337fe14be4ca1553025aa8d6c1566937c9f999a573b7dd2c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,Early bird dinners draw a younger crowd in Miami Beach.,91324ed9-1b53-5a30-82bf-0ad82433fd77,N24News/imgs/91324ed9-1b53-5a30-82bf-0ad82433fd77.jpg,8
Opinion,"A Suicide, an App and a Time for a Reckoning",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/25/opinion/robinhood-suicide-trading.html,"I spent a lot of time this week trying to come up with the best way to get those who make things in Silicon Valley to better understand the suicide of Alex Kearns, a student at the University of Nebraska. He killed himself after he mistakenly believed that he had a $730,000 negative balance on the millennial-popular Robinhood app, which he had downloaded to learn about investing. The tragedy got a lot of attention, especially after Forbes reported that Mr. Kearns left a note behind asking, ""How was a 20-year-old with no income able to get assigned almost a million dollars of leverage?"" Embedded in that query is a much bigger one that has been plaguing the tech industry and its innovative entrepreneurs for far too long: What is the reason for their persistent tendency to ignore the potentially dangerous impact of their creations? These days the companies can seem not just careless but also predatory. Is it to make more money? Is it because growth trumps safety? Is it rank sloppiness? Lack of foresight? A design flaw that could have and, more to the point, should have been anticipated? A laser focus on innovation? All of the above?

Perhaps the reason hardly matters, since, as Robert Louis Stevenson wrote, ""Everybody, soon or late, sits down at a banquet of consequences."" And that is the ashen meal now in front of Robinhood's co-founders and co-chief executives, Vlad Tenev and Baiju Bhatt. The company, based in Menlo Park, Calif., has become a phenom since its founding in 2013. Using an addictive and hyper-gamified interface, seamless and instant onboarding to the glories of trading and an occasional dollop of animated confetti to jack up the fun factor, Robinhood use has grown fast among young people, many of whom are newbies to investing. While there have been troubling outages and worries that the app has been designed to feel more like a casino than a sober pathway for important financial decisions, the longtime idea of democratizing entrance to the stock market -- I covered the advent of popular online trading companies like eTrade in the late 1990s -- is an important one. And there is no doubt that Robinhood has been among the most innovative standouts in the fintech space (especially in removing friction, which is at the heart of this app, and in offering new features like fractional shares). That success has attracted $1.2 billion in investments from eager venture capital firms, including $280 million last month from the top-tier investor Sequoia Capital, bringing Robinhood's valuation to $8.3 billion.

And the pandemic has been a boon to the company, making it a good bet for investors. Robinhood has added an astonishing three million accounts in the first quarter of this year, bringing the total to 13 million. A growth chart that goes up and to the right is all well and good, but has Robinhood, as one person said to me, ""made the classic Silicon Valley mistake of applying games and brain hacks to an extremely important sector,"" even as it underinvested in key parts of the business like customer service? Robinhood has certainly doubled down on eliminating friction, which in Silicon Valley is almost like a religious tenet. Too many clicks are akin to a major sin to techies, as are too many ""just a sec"" warnings, even though most people find stop signs useful if irritating in real life. It's not clear yet how things went awry in Mr. Kearns's case, except that the way the app rendered his account before his death appeared to make him think that he was deep in a financial hole. Of his own accord, he was engaged in complex options trading, but without much oversight on the transactions and without enough information about options trading on the app. All added up, the calculation proved deadly for him. Options trading can be very risky -- and is not recommended for the inexperienced investor like Mr. Kearns. To do it, Robinhood requires an eligibility questionnaire and for a user to certify his investing experience, along with signing an acknowledgment of risk and a promise to read its materials on the topic. Other brokerage firms provide more substantive interactions on their riskiest financial instruments and even offer to explain risks in real-time conversations before allowing an investment to proceed. One investor I spoke with likened the Robinhood experience to giving a Ferrari to a kid without a driver's license. That kind of carelessness is especially problematic when it comes to young men, who studies have shown are more attracted to online trading, especially because of its often addictive characteristics, and whose emotional investment can be too high. In an interview with me this week, Mr. Tenev said the company could not comment on the specifics of Mr. Kearns's account because of privacy concerns. But clearly chastened and shaken by the tragedy, he acknowledged that fast growth has been a management issue.

""We had our challenges and had not anticipated 2020 shaking out the way it did,"" Mr. Tenev said. ""Customer support has been strained, but the team has been hiring."" A company representative said Robinhood had grown its customer service department by over 40 percent already this year, which has included adding registered financial-services professionals. And the company says it wants to double its customer service staff by the end of the year. Mr. Tenev stressed again what he and Mr. Bhatt had written about Mr. Kearns in an unusually self-critical blog post: Robinhood announced a commitment to more investment in app education resources, significant changes in its interface around options and a $250,000 donation to suicide prevention. ""It is certainly not lost upon us that Robinhood, especially with retail investing in America, has recognized that we have a huge responsibility,"" he said. ""We want to be out in front of issues and be the best and safest options platform."" Still, some think Robinhood failed Mr. Kearns. Bill Brewster, a professional investor whose wife is Mr. Kearns's cousin, said the young man appeared excited and eager to learn about investing. It was Mr. Brewster who raised Robinhood's failures in the Kearns matter on Twitter. While he gave the company credit for its response and some of the moves it says it is going to make, Mr. Brewster remains worried that Robinhood does not understand or appreciate its responsibilities. ""You are playing with real fire to allow inexperienced people to play with the riskiest of financial instruments,"" he said. ""There is always personal responsibility, of course. But as a society, I think we owe youth some sort of oversight, and it feels like someone was asleep at the wheel there.""",Companies like the stock-trading app Robinhood can seem not just careless but also predatory.,14440a84-16ac-56f2-ba6e-c62b86ac711c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/25/opinion/25swisher1/25swisher1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6435fad73bef5f6b9eeb098193072a05ff91a82b994c5d49b3516e2b7793a8de&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Robinhood investment app is seen on a smartphone.,14440a84-16ac-56f2-ba6e-c62b86ac711c,N24News/imgs/14440a84-16ac-56f2-ba6e-c62b86ac711c.jpg,11
Health,Juul Suspends Online Sales of Flavored E-Cigarettes,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/17/health/vaping-juul-e-cigarettes.html,"Juul Labs announced on Thursday that it would temporarily halt online sales of flavored e-cigarettes like mango, products the company had already stopped distributing to retail stores as public outrage mounted over the soaring rate of teenage vaping. Facing multiple federal and state investigations into its marketing practices, w it decided to discontinue the sales for now until the Food and Drug Administration had reviewed the device and flavor cartridges. But the suspension, which also includes creme, fruit and cucumber, does not extend to menthol or mint. Last month, the F.D.A. issued warning letters to the company, saying it had illegally marketed its products as a safer alternative than traditional cigarettes. The agency also criticized its ""make the switch"" marketing campaign, contending that its advertising suggested health claims that the company had not proved. The agency has continued to investigate Juul's marketing strategies, as parents and public health experts argued that its array of flavors were directly aimed at youth and could addict a new generation to nicotine. And while the recent wave of mysterious lung illnesses that has stricken 1,479 people is mostly tied to vaping THC-oil products that may be tainted or adulterated, the health effects of vaping nicotine liquids in e-cigarettes have also come under intense examination by researchers and public health officials. Thirty-three deaths have been reported.

The company's decision appeared to be an effort to get ahead of the Trump administration's anticipated ban on flavored e-cigarettes, which is still expected to include mint and menthol despite lobbying by some trade groups opposed to barring menthol. Top health officials had said in mid-September they would issue a draft ban within weeks, although several vaping groups have vowed to fight the ban -- especially the restriction on menthol. In the meantime, major retailers like Walmart and Walgreens have decided to stop selling e-cigarettes and a number of states have tried to impose bans mainly on flavored products. Vaping businesses are waging court battles against the restrictions in some states. K.C. Crosthwaite, the company's new chief executive, acknowledged that the decision to further curb sales of certain flavors was occurring against a backdrop of public mistrust of the industry.

Since taking the post, he has also suspended Juul's advertising, and withdrawn the company's support for a San Francisco ballot measure that sought to reverse the city's ban on e-cigarette sales. It remains on the ballot, however. ""We must reset the vapor category by earning the trust of society and working cooperatively with regulators, policymakers and stakeholders to combat underage use while providing an alternative to adult smokers,"" Mr. Crosthwaite said in making the announcement on Thursday. E-cigarette sales have declined somewhat in the last several weeks, as the twin health crises of teenage vaping and the illnesses unfolded. Weekly sales of Juul's flavor pods have dropped from 14.3 million in early June to 11 million for the week ending Oct. 5. Company officials have previously indicated that online sales account for less than 10 percent of its overall revenue. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The mint and menthol varieties are among Juul's biggest sellers, and the company said Thursday that it would continue to sell them, and its two tobacco flavors, in retail stores and online. Juul has said it would not itself lobby against the proposed flavor ban. But the major United States tobacco companies -- like Juul's investor Altria and Reynolds American, which makes the Vuse e-cigarette -- have long argued that these flavors are important for smokers who want to switch to e-cigarettes. A new poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that roughly half of Americans favored a ban on flavored or all e-cigarettes, although people ages 18 to 29 opposed both. Michael Bloomberg, who has been funding a $160 million campaign to lower youth vaping, was unimpressed by Juul's announcement.

""Juul knows that nearly two-thirds of high school students who use e-cigarettes now use mint or menthol flavors, which is driving Juul's bottom line,"" said Mr. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York City. ""This is precisely why the F.D.A. must honor its commitment to remove all flavored e-cigarettes from the shelves as quickly as possible."" Mr. Crosthwaite said the company was weighing whether mint or menthol should be removed from the market. Juul is the target of numerous lawsuits, filed by municipalities and now school districts; parents of some teenagers are also suing the company, claiming addiction and harm. Earlier this month, the Montgomery County Council, of Maryland, filed a lawsuit against Juul Labs and Altria Group, claiming that the companies had violated Maryland and federal law by aggressively marketing addictive e-cigarettes to minors. On Thursday, the government of King County, Wash., which includes Seattle, also filed suit against Juul, claiming that the company had created and maintained the youth vaping epidemic. ""It is clear that Juul, like Big Tobacco before it, targeted youth to hook a whole new generation on candy-coated nicotine,"" Dow Constantine, the county executive, said. ""Juul was well aware that their products would appeal to youth -- driving what is now an ever increasing epidemic of nicotine addiction and severe lung illness. Now the taxpayers of King County are left to cope with a public health crisis that has lined the pockets of Juul and their shareholders, and we will not stand for it.""","Facing multiple inquiries into its marketing practices and its role in the rise of teenage vaping, the company suspended internet access to mango, cucumber and other pods.",f633d12a-000c-5cce-a8f8-c9c39f964aa9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/17/science/17JUUL/17JUUL-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=fc782863eb5b47f5a75cf12704f0411580591fd38a27cc2dce3324754c27b687&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Food and Drug Administration has issued warning letters to the company.,f633d12a-000c-5cce-a8f8-c9c39f964aa9,N24News/imgs/f633d12a-000c-5cce-a8f8-c9c39f964aa9.jpg,1
Technology,"Facebook Bars Alex Jones, Louis Farrakhan and Others From Its Services",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/technology/facebook-alex-jones-louis-farrakhan-ban.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- After years of wavering about how to handle the extreme voices populating its platform, Facebook on Thursday evicted seven of its most controversial users -- many of whom are conservatives -- immediately inflaming the debate about the power and accountability of large technology companies. The social network said it had barred Alex Jones, the conspiracy theorist and founder of Infowars, from its platform, along with a handful of other extremists. Louis Farrakhan, the outspoken black nationalist minister who has frequently been criticized for his anti-Semitic remarks, was also banned. The Silicon Valley company said these users were disallowed from using Facebook and Instagram under its policies against ""dangerous individuals and organizations."" ""We've always banned individuals or organizations that promote or engage in violence and hate, regardless of ideology,"" a Facebook spokeswoman said in a statement. ""The process for evaluating potential violators is extensive and it is what led us to our decision to remove these accounts today."" Facebook's move is one of the tech industry's broadest actions to punish high-profile extremists at a time when social media companies are under fire for allowing hateful content and misinformation to spread on their services.

It is a politically delicate moment, as President Trump and others have accused the companies of censoring right-wing opinions and of having too much influence over free speech. Last week, Mr. Trump met with Twitter's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, after calling his company ""very discriminatory."" With the bans, Facebook went further than it has in the past to deal with fear- and hate-mongering on its services. The company previously preferred to focus on reducing the distribution of harmful content and removing individual posts that violate its rules, rather than banning users entirely. Last year, a Facebook official, posting from the company's official Twitter account, said that ""we just don't think banning Pages for sharing conspiracy theories or false news is the right way to go."" That piecemeal approach has been insufficient, with new reports of lies and hate speech surfacing on Facebook almost daily. The company is also under pressure from regulators to clean up its platform. Last week, it said it was expecting the Federal Trade Commission to fine it up to $5 billion for privacy violations. The scrutiny has prompted Facebook to evaluate its direction. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, last month said he was shifting the site away from being a public town square in favor of private communications. On Tuesday, he unveiled a redesign of Facebook's mobile app and desktop site to focus on more private group-based communications. [Get the Bits newsletter for the latest from Silicon Valley and the technology industry.] Paul Barrett, deputy director of New York University's Stern Center for Business and Human Rights, said on Thursday that Facebook's action of banning extremists was long overdue.

""For too long, Facebook and other social media companies have claimed not to be 'arbiters of the truth' that appears on their platforms,"" he said. ""Facebook's newest move to remove extremists like Alex Jones and Milo Yiannopoulos from the platform is just the latest piece of evidence that this is not the case. The social media companies not only have the right, but an ethical responsibility to remove disinformation and hate speech and those who spread it from their platforms."" Many of the users barred by Facebook had previously been prohibited on other social media services. Mr. Yiannopoulos, a former Breitbart editor and far-right media personality, was banned from Twitter in 2016 after leading a harassment campaign against the actress Leslie Jones. Laura Loomer, a right-wing provocateur, was barred by Twitter earlier this year for making Islamophobic comments about Representative Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota. The others banned by Facebook on Thursday were Paul Joseph Watson, an Infowars contributor, and Paul Nehlen, a white nationalist who ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 2018. Infowars was also booted. Mr. Watson said in a tweet that he was given no reason for his eviction by Facebook. ""I broke none of their rules,"" he said. ""In an authoritarian society controlled by a handful of Silicon Valley giants, all dissent must be purged."" He also appealed to the president for help, complaining in a tweet that Facebook was ""now just banning people for wrongthink,"" with ""no pretense of enforcing rules."" Other banned users scrambled to steer their followers to other platforms. Ms. Loomer pointed her Instagram followers to her channel on Telegram, a messaging app. Mr. Yiannopoulos told his Instagram followers to sign up for his email newsletter. An email to Infowars was not returned. Mr. Farrakhan, Mr. Nehlen and Ms. Loomer could not be reached. A conspiracy theorist. Mr. Jones, who founded the website Infowars in 1999, has spread conspiracy theories and misinformation for years, including false claims that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School was a hoax. A far-right broadcaster and pitchman. Mr. Jones built a substantial following by appealing to conspiracy-minded, largely white, male listeners via his website and radio show, where he amassed a fortune by hawking diet supplements and survivalist gear. A spreader of misinformation. Facebook and YouTube, among other tech companies, have removed most of Mr. Jones's content in an effort to curb the spread of misinformation. The bans have drastically reduced his reach. A Trump ally. Mr. Jones was an early supporter of Donald Trump, who has adopted many of Mr. Jones's conspiracy theories. Mr. Jones also has echoed the former president's false claims about the pandemic and the 2020 election. Held liable for defamation. In four lawsuits brought by the families of 10 Sandy Hook shooting victims, judges found that because Mr. Jones refused to turn over documents ordered by the courts, including financial records, he lost the cases by default. At Facebook, the bans follow an internal discussion about its content policies, said two people with knowledge of the matter, who were not authorized to speak publicly. For the past few months, the company has discussed the policies because they either focused on banning a single account, which was too narrow, or labeling someone a purveyor of hate speech or someone who incited violence, which was overly broad and required removing all associated accounts and the content under review -- including those of anyone else who was supporting the same views.

The company has stressed in the past that it continuously reviews its content policies and the ways they work -- or the ways they do not work -- with the way people use Facebook. Facebook's policy team discussed how some accounts spread dangerous content but stopped short of encouraging violence or being directly affiliated with hate groups. They also wanted to find a way to remove the accounts or pages of a ""dangerous individual"" without blocking others from discussing what that person was saying, the people said. So in recent months, the social network updated its policies to navigate that middle ground, they said. Facebook then found instances of extremism by Mr. Jones and others that pushed the company to take action against them. For example, Mr. Jones last year hosted an Infowars show featuring Gavin McInnes, a far-right political commentator whom Facebook had designated as a hate figure. Mr. Yiannopoulos had also signaled praise for Mr. McInnes earlier this year. Social media companies have banned users affiliated with ISIS and other foreign extremist groups for years. But the fear of angering Republican lawmakers, or provoking an unwanted censorship debate, have made executives at these companies tread more carefully when it comes to domestic far-right extremists. ""I'm sure they're going to make a slippery-slope argument here,"" said Joan Donovan, the director of Harvard's Technology and Social Change Research Project, who studies online extremism. ""But if this kind of removal of services is because these people are in fact using their accounts to violate terms of service, or organize networked harassment, then it's not really about conservative speech or any form of speech."" Many of the users barred by Facebook remain active on YouTube and other social platforms. Mr. Watson maintains an active channel on YouTube, where he has 1.6 million subscribers. Mr. Jones, who was kicked off YouTube last year, has made guest appearances on the channels of other popular users since his ban, including the podcast host Joe Rogan and Logan Paul, a YouTube creator with 19 million subscribers. Tech companies' crackdowns do not just affect the reputations of these extremist figures. They also affect their earnings, by cutting them off from large audiences who support them financially. Mr. Yiannopoulos, who was banned by Venmo and PayPal last year after using the services to harass a Jewish journalist, is reportedly in debt, and Mr. Jones -- who claimed that earlier bans would strengthen him by calling attention to his cause -- has seen traffic to his web properties fall sharply. On Wednesday, a day before his latest thwarting, Mr. Jones sent an email newsletter to his fans, thanking them for ""supporting the infowar"" and advertising discounted dietary supplements and water filtration systems.

Okeniyi has a strong presence that conveys a genuine moral authority. It stands in stark relief against the movie's consistently cartoonish portrayals of the white slavers. And Shield's journey -- which, given the gravity of the movie's subject, flirts weirdly with the picaresque -- moves with dispatch. Shields eventually lands in Brown's militia.

Cromwell portrays Brown as both a cagey strategist and an unreasonable but necessary risk-taker, righteous and common-sensical, save for his eagerness to sacrifice himself and his followers.

Automobiles,"Less Motor, More Grip, and It All Makes Sense",https://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/automobiles/autoreviews/14audi-s4.html,"ONCE upon a time -- say, around 2004 -- the 340-horsepower S4 was Audi's 8-cylinder answer to the mighty BMW M3. It seemed pretty crazy at the time, a little car like an A4 running around with a V-8 under the hood. But soon, the Great German Horsepower Wars went nuclear: Audi rolled out the 418-horsepower RS4, and BMW introduced a V-8-powered M3. Further down the line, BMW's lesser 3 Series models were also fortified, with the BMW 335i getting a twin-turbocharged 6-cylinder good for 300 horsepower. This left the S4 competing against the 335i, while the RS4 took on the M3. Aligned to this revised hierarchy, the new 2010 S4 has a bit less power than the old S4, a bit more power than the new BMW 335is, and exactly the same output -- 333 horsepower -- as the previous-generation M3. You follow? In accordance with its new role as the middle child of the A4 lineup, the S4 is entirely more sensible than its predecessor. The V-8 is gone, replaced by a supercharged direct-injection V-6. Also gone is the V-8's gas-guzzler tax; with the dual-clutch automated manual transmission, the S4 is rated 18 m.p.g. in town and a relatively respectable 28 m.p.g. on the highway, according to the Environmental Protection Agency.

The price is down, too. With a base sticker of $46,725, this S4 costs 9 percent less than the last one. Come on down to Crazy Ferdinand's Bargain Haus, where you will see Audi prices drop like an ill-prepared hiker from the top of the Weisshorn! So Audi has downsized the cylinder count, lifted the fuel economy and cut the price. Is this austerity, or what? GARAGE SALE The redesigned S4 carries a sticker price 9 percent lower than its predecessor. Not exactly, because the S4 is also faster. With either the 6-speed manual transmission or the 7-speed automated manual, the S4 will sprint from a stop to 60 miles per hour in a bit less than five seconds, about a half-second quicker than the old S4 with the V-8. In fact, this supercharged V-6 feels more potent than the V-8 although its horsepower is nominally less. That's because you had to wind the V-8 to within a hair of the rev limiter to extract its power, while the V-6's forced induction helps it pump out piles of accessible torque at low engine speeds. The 3-liter V-6, despite giving up 1.2 liters of displacement to the V-8, produces 325 pound-feet -- 23 more than the 8-cylinder could muster. And you can feel it.

In any previous Audi review (save for those of the midengine R8), this would be the place where there'd be a caveat about the handling. Audis are based on front-wheel-drive platforms, so they have a pronounced front-end weight bias. This means that, when driven hard, the front tires will want to push wide in corners. But I drove the new S4 on a tight road course, and I don't think it's an exaggeration to say that this is the first Audi sedan that truly dances. Its all comes down to the ""sport rear differential,"" an $1,100 option that any serious driver should consider mandatory. As in cars like the Saab Turbo X, BMW X6 and Mitsubishi Evo, Audi's rear differential can apportion extra torque to the outside rear wheel in corners, effectively throttle-steering the rear of the car and tucking the nose in toward your intended line. The effect is transformational. The car seems to work better the harder you drive, powering from corner to corner with supreme confidence. It feels a lot like an upmarket Evo, in that the S4 always flatters your driving skills, its trick all-wheel-drive system compensating for all but the most egregious mistakes. I'd be interested in comparing the lap times of the 2010 S4 and the old RS4, but I'd wager that on a tight track, the S4's muscular torque curve and superior handling would more than make up for its horsepower deficit. When you're not exploring the limits of physics, the S4's interior is a comfortable place to while away a commute, with all the expensive-looking materials that are expected of a car in this price range -- and especially in an Audi. On the options menu you would probably want the $1,000 ""silk nappa"" leather seats, which look and feel as if they belong in a six-figure sports car. The 14-speaker 505-watt Bang & Olufsen sound system is a bargain at $850.

Based on all of the new S4's superlatives, you'd think the old one was an ill-handling, gas-guzzling blunt instrument, the German reincarnation of a 1970 Chevelle SS 454. But the 1970 Chevelle SS had its charm. And so did the V-8-powered S4. And that leads to my only significant gripe about the new S4 that, along with all the qualitative improvements, Audi may have inadvertently given the car a bravado-ectomy. With the demise of the 3.2 V-6 model, the S4 is now the midrange A4, slotted between the 4-cylinder 2.0T and the inevitable RS4. And it seems Audi is saving the overt aggression for the RS flagship. For example, the flat-spoke S4 wheels that defined the first two generations (and evoked the gorgeous alloys on an old Bugatti) are gone, replaced by split-spoke wheels that look nice enough but seem a little generic. The bombastic V-8 exhaust note that consistently startled onlookers -- that little car is making that noise? -- is history. And if I may, let's have a moment of silence for the seven horsepower that are no longer with us. I know the difference is academic, but it's symbolic: performance cars are supposed to become more powerful, not less. Given that this is a supercharged motor, Audi could easily have tinkered with the boost to arrive at, say, 341 horsepower. Instead, it decided to take a small step back, sacrificing those seven horsepower to tell a story of sober restraint and responsibility. This seems just a little bit contrived: I like to imagine that horsepower numbers are dictated by the engineering, not the public relations. Still, the redesigned S4 is superior to its predecessor in just about every other way. It's quicker and less expensive, it gets better mileage and it finally offers handling that challenges BMW. But I'll still miss that noise.","With the new S4, Audi has downsized the cylinder count, lifted the fuel economy and cut the price — but the car still manages to be faster than its predecessor.",af1e7498-7438-592e-a0b5-935a4a40c261,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/03/14/automobiles/14WHEEL-span/14WHEEL-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=275&w=600&s=3ece8a865471c32965c6d43f6a107d97abe4ece060016b333776e780c35837be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"SETTLED IN The S4, once Audi's hard-edged performance sedan, now falls in the middle position of the A4 line.",af1e7498-7438-592e-a0b5-935a4a40c261,N24News/imgs/af1e7498-7438-592e-a0b5-935a4a40c261.jpg,23
Real Estate,"How to Get to Manhattan? Save, Save, Save",https://www.nytimes.com/2014/09/14/realestate/how-to-get-to-manhattan-save-save-save.html,"How to Get to Manhattan? Save, Save, Save

After her 2011 graduation from Binghamton University in upstate New York, Anne Gole returned home to Tenafly, N.J. To her, doing so was far preferable to doing what her friends did -- squeeze into tiny, pricey city rentals with roommates. Ms. Gole, analytical through and through, came of age during the financial crisis. ""It was scary and it motivated me to work at something I was interested in,"" she said. ""While other kids were talking about happy hours, I was talking about mortgage rates.""

Though Tenafly is not far from Manhattan as the crow flies, ""it's not as if you are teleporting right there, like you are on a zip line,"" said Ms. Gole, who is 23. With no train, she endured an hourlong bus commute to Port Authority for her 12-hour workdays at her office in Times Square. By late last fall, she had saved enough for a down payment and was ready to start the hunt. Her price was up to $450,000 for a spacious studio or one-bedroom co-op in a quiet East Side building with a doorman and elevator. She wanted good light and a window on the street. ""There are some things money can buy, like a new kitchen,"" she said. But other things were unchangeable -- ""like if your windows face a brick wall."" It was also important that the building be sound financially and have no assessments, Ms. Gole said, ""because assessments often mean trouble,"" such as the consequences of deferred maintenance, or legal action. She worked with Rita Wolf, an agent at Fenwick Keats Real Estate. ""Anne had a good idea of what she wanted,"" Ms. Wolf said. ""She wasn't fixated on being on 14th Street or below, as many young people are."" Actually, ""she wanted to see whatever was out there,"" and Ms. Wolf tried to ""curb her desire to see every single possibility.""

One early option was a one-bedroom in a nicely kept postwar building on East 61st Street, just blocks from Bloomingdale's. The sunny apartment, far smaller than Ms. Gole had anticipated, was a for-sale-by-owner offering, priced at around $574,000. Maintenance was just under $1,300 a month. ""It gave her something to compare other things to,"" Ms. Wolf said. ""I thought it was overpriced."" It later sold for about $518,000. Nearby, on East 63rd Street, in a neighborhood Ms. Gole called ""Bloomingdale's East,"" a sunny studio in another postwar co-op was $330,000, with monthly maintenance of around $800. But traffic from the Queensboro Bridge funneled onto the block. Ms. Gole, stuck in traffic, barely made it to the open house. The location deterred her, and the apartment needed more work than she was prepared to do. She strayed briefly to the Gramercy area, but places there seemed small, dingy and expensive compared to those on the East Side. ""You could really see the difference in prices,"" Ms. Wolf said.

It was on a low floor and had that incurable defect, a brick wall right outside the windows. ""It didn't clear the building next door, so it wasn't a view apartment,"" Ms. Wolf said. ""They did the best with what they had. It was a charming apartment."" It later sold for the listing price of $345,000. Maintenance was around $1,100 a month. With open houses scheduled every Sunday, Ms. Gole became frustrated and exhausted. She declined invitations to go out, telling her friends, ""I have 10 open houses all lined up."" One cold weekday evening last winter, she visited a postwar white-brick building in the ""Bloomingdale's East"" neighborhood. There, she saw a one-bedroom with a sunny southern exposure. This one was $425,000, with monthly maintenance of a little more than $1,000.

There were a few glitches, like a miscalculation about kitchen tiles, which almost ended up two different colors. Some closet doors don't shut fully. And the sun is so bright that she often keeps the blinds drawn during the day. Ms. Gole bought a sleeper sofa so friends can stay over, and decorated in a "" '70s Modern style,"" that's ""clean and white with pops of color"" -- mostly pink. She bought a lawn chair for the roof deck. ""My pleasant surprise is the roof deck door doesn't lock, so you can't lock yourself out,"" she said. With a 20-minute subway commute instead of an hourlong bus ride, she gets more sleep and has more energy. ""Weekends, I didn't even want to go out in the city,"" she said. ""The commute really took away from the magic the city had."" Now, she has the leisure to enjoy it. ""I have so much more time to myself.""","Anne Gole had a plan, and saved for it: to live in an apartment on the East Side.",22f1d8e8-9e28-5470-baf4-f0d6d5bb63c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/09/14/realestate/14HUNT-MAIN/14HUNT-MAIN-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2014&h=400&w=600&s=97054c665ec77a11efc161851dc13ba071e531bf0fee313059ec0266a065357f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"THE BUYER Since she stopped commuting by bus, Anne Gole has more energy for exploring the city.",22f1d8e8-9e28-5470-baf4-f0d6d5bb63c9,N24News/imgs/22f1d8e8-9e28-5470-baf4-f0d6d5bb63c9.jpg,7
Style,Campy Bar Revs Up Its Sweaty Party,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/24/style/mehanata-bar-lower-east-side.html,"The weekend bar scene on the Lower East Side often devolves into a slurry of drunken shouting, projectile vomit and police horse manure. Thankfully, a winsome and fashionable alternative can be found at Mehanata, the campy Bulgarian bar that moved to Ludlow Street in 2006 after being ousted from its digs on Broadway and Canal Street.

Mehanata is the latest hermit crab scuttle for Travis Bass, the night life impresario who hosted ephemeral, fog-shrouded parties at Madame Wong and other Chinatown restaurants.

Around midnight on a Friday last month, he heaved back vodka shots in a refrigerated glass box while wearing a Soviet military hat and wool jacket. ""It's a Disneyland for adults,"" Mr. Bass said of Mehanata. ""It's like a house party. It feels like somewhere you went with your uncle or auntie in Cancun.""

Mehanata faces a parking garage and sits aside a jammed Mexican cantina. Its basement is narrow and sweaty, with mirrored pillars, a disco ball and poles where limber visitors swing in Richardson bathing suits (or less). The ground floor, which feels like a carnival version of ""Westworld,"" has rope swings, faux log cabin walls and a mounted wagon wheel.","Mehanata, a Lower East Side favorite, gets a fashionable refresh on Ludlow Street.",fc2964a9-e628-548a-a6c7-4460b5fd1172,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/26/fashion/22BOITE-1/22BOITE-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8add391fa2716715d226b72e1b3df095db1b3bb3c994069e60d9172b41d5941a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Performers at a party hosted by Travis Bass at Mehanata in June.,fc2964a9-e628-548a-a6c7-4460b5fd1172,N24News/imgs/fc2964a9-e628-548a-a6c7-4460b5fd1172.jpg,15
Movies,How Did 'The Shape of Water' Become the Film to Beat at the Oscars?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/07/movies/the-shape-of-water-guillermo-del-toro-oscar.html,"This awards season has been all about hitting the zeitgeist, or at least that's what the media, present company included, has been telling itself and you. Best picture nominees ought to tap into the #MeToo moment or, failing that, anxieties born in the age of Trump. But is that narrative really true? And does it fully explain how a fairy tale about a janitor who hooks up with a fishman became the movie to beat? The film, ""The Shape of Water,"" stars Sally Hawkins as a cleaning lady who falls for a merman held captive in a government lab, and leads the race with 13 Oscar nominations, more than any other movie. It has also scooped up key precursor awards that often culminate in Oscar gold -- last weekend, the Directors Guild of America gave the filmmaker Guillermo del Toro its top prize, two weeks after the Producers Guild of America did the same. That a fantasy film has made it this far is highly unusual. While some fantasy and sci-fi movies have been nominated for best picture (""Avatar,"" ""District 9,"" ""Inception"" and ""Mad Max: Fury Road""), with the exception of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King,"" it is hard to name one that has gone all the way. Meanwhile, should Mr. del Toro nab best director, which is expected, it will mark the fourth time a Mexican filmmaker has done so in the last five years. !Viva Mexico!

The movie's winning trajectory has had its bumps. ""Shape"" was not nominated for best ensemble performance at the Screen Actors Guild Awards and, as forecasters invariably note, no film since ""Braveheart"" (1995) has won the best picture Oscar without previously landing a SAG ensemble nomination. But while the winner of the SAG ensemble prize was ""Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri,"" presumably making it the stiffest competition facing ""Shape,"" the ""Three Billboards"" filmmaker, Martin McDonagh, did not get an Oscar nomination for best director, while Mr. del Toro did. Advantage, fishman. The Bagger put the question of why ""Shape"" has surged to the fore to a handful of Hollywood insiders and academy voters, and received answers as varied as the colors of a merman's scales. Among the many thoughts: The film was not just beautifully made but also emotionally resonant. It was an elegant genre piece that said something new. Some thought its success was helped by admiration that industry folks harbor for Mr. del Toro; others saw the handiwork of masterful marketers and campaigners, who overcame a familiar plot. Some said the ardor the film elicited had nothing to do with the zeitgeist, and besides, academy members don't think about such pedestrian matters when voting for best picture. Others said the film was totally plugged into the moment, with its story of a ragtag threesome of underdogs -- a mute woman (who is sexually harassed), a black woman and a closeted gay artist -- who work to save a demonized ""other"" from the man. Michael Shamberg, an Oscar-nominated producer whose credits include ""Erin Brockovich"" and ""The Big Chill,"" is among the full-throated lovers of ""The Shape of Water."" In a phone chat, Mr. Shamberg said the movie ""hits every base of what filmmaking should do.""

Guillermo del Toro narrates a sequence from his film featuring Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones. The film received 13 Oscar nominations, including best picture. My name is Guillermo del Toro, and I'm the director, producer, co-writer of ""The Shape of Water."" This is an important scene because it's a scene that sets the communication between Elisa and the creature. It was important in the story because the way I introduce the creature in the screenplay first is with a shock, very much like a monster movie, with a hand against the glass. Then, I introduce the fact that he ate two of the fingers of the villain in the piece, you know, the antagonist. And then I introduce him on a scene previous to this, and I keep it on an edge. You know, I show you an innocent and a beauty through the way his eyes move and look. But it's still a dangerous creature, maybe. Maybe not. But there is definitely a contact between them. I also show you that he's bleeding, that he has been tortured, so you know the reaction maybe was justified. So in this sequence, I do it -- I knew it was a prologue to a montage, so I wanted to keep it very much stylistically in one piece. So I do three -- three shots, two of them very elaborate with a small crane. And I show you the placing of the egg, the -- the placing of the record. Everything is a single shot. Until we go out to a wide shot of Eliza, and it's a very quaint composition. It's a -- it's very, very sort of meek, you know? She's sitting by the pool eating her little sandwich. It's sort of a beautiful picnic of -- of -- of really intense oddity, you know? And -- and -- and that's what the movie is. The movie is the marriage of the ordinary and the extraordinary, which is a very Mexican vocation, because it's the story of a woman that falls in love with a river god. And where does she keep him? In her bathtub. So in this montage, I'm going to show you symbolic little things that remind you of her routine alone. The -- the boiled eggs, which she used to share alone, and that have a very sexual connotation of activities alone. The bathtub, she's looking at the bathtub, making plans, perhaps, for her future with the creature, you know? All this is going on with her. And at the same time, her love of musicals, which has been set up in the movie several times. I wanted to show her dancing with the mop like Fred Astaire, you know, sort of a very classical musical routine solo, and the connection between them through the glass. They are still not together. There's a glass separating them. And they both -- both move beautifully together, but they are not together yet, so there's a longing to the scene that I find very moving. [music] Guillermo del Toro narrates a sequence from his film featuring Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones. The film received 13 Oscar nominations, including best picture.

Mr. Shamberg scoffed at the idea that academy voters ""think meta about a film to send a message."" He added: ""There's no lens for Trump that anybody is voting through in this category. The Oscars do celebrate filmmaking, and it's very rare that the best ones don't win out."" Dennis Rice, a marketing and distribution consultant who has worked at Miramax and Disney, said the fact that many people found ""The Shape of Water"" so moving helped explain why it is doing so well. He also attributed its success to an ace marketing campaign, which, he wrote in an email, ""focused on audiences' emotional connection to the film and led people away from the film's shortcomings, especially the derivative story,"" which he described as ""Beauty and the Beast"" meets ""Splash"" meets ""Creature From the Black Lagoon."" Mr. del Toro has said himself that his aim was make a version of ""Beauty and the Beast"" using a ""Black Lagoon""-ish amphibious man, and that he had wanted to make the film for decades, a detail that was duly incorporated into the Oscar campaign: It was a passion project.

Affable and driven by childlike wonder, Mr. del Toro had been familiar to American audiences for years before he captured the academy's affection in 2006, with his lauded ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" one of his fairy tales for adults. ""He was not going to just put a guy in a superhero outfit and make a lot of money,"" Mr. Rice said. ""He breaks the boundaries of reality and fantasy and real-time issues."" Some see real-time issues being addressed in ""The Shape of Water."" Christine Langan, who is the chief executive of Baby Cow Productions, Steve Coogan's company, and the former head of BBC Films, said that at a moment when people are talking about women's agency, it was gratifying to see a female protagonist who cannot speak wholly drive the story. Ms. Langan also saw in the film a validation of cinema, ""a reminder of why people go sit and watch,"" which of course is deeply comforting to industry folks anxious about the mighty rise of tiny screens and streaming services. ""It's layered and intelligent and accessible but mainstream,"" she said. ""It's just magical."" And Ms. Langan delighted in the casting of Ms. Hawkins, an Englishwoman. ""She has a wonderful delicacy that suggests so much,"" Ms. Langan said, a sentiment that is likely shared by many in the sizable British contingent of academy voters. Donna Gigliotti, an Oscar-winning producer whose credits include ""Hidden Figures"" and ""Silver Linings Playbook,"" said there was little doubt that the academy's expansion of international voters gave a boost to Mr. del Toro. (Industry enthusiasm for the film predated an outcry over the lack of Latinos in the acting categories.) ""He is regarded, and he is, an auteur,"" Ms. Gigliotti said. Of course one of Mr. del Toro's Oscar competitors, Christopher Nolan, is also viewed as an auteur, and is an Englishman to boot. But while Mr. Nolan's war drama ""Dunkirk"" might be his most Oscar-ish film yet, earning him his first best direction nomination, it hasn't drummed up as much buzz. With eight nominations, ""Dunkirk"" is up against ""The Shape of Water"" in many of the ""below the line"" craft and technical categories, like film editing, sound editing and production design. It also told its harrowing World War II rescue story from shifting viewpoints, and had no acting nominees. For all of its cinematic virtuosity, its lack of a protagonist gave little for the audience to connect with emotionally.","Awards voters have loved it so far, but just why is a matter of debate: Some think it taps into the zeitgeist; others say it's just filmmaking at its best.",ba0508c1-a56d-52b0-8ab8-491dc0411768,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/08/arts/08bagger-shapeofwater/08bagger-shapeofwater-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=cbc5c94d0e9791cc9d9f5682ac0f13cbfe31bb4d8da30ec96a064200971d36d4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Sally Hawkins as a mute janitor in &ldquo;The Shape of Water.&rdquo;,ba0508c1-a56d-52b0-8ab8-491dc0411768,N24News/imgs/ba0508c1-a56d-52b0-8ab8-491dc0411768.jpg,5
Books,The 'Insane' Way Our Prison System Handles the Mentally Ill,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/22/books/review/insane-alisa-roth.html,"In 1946, Life magazine published an expose that declared most American mental hospitals ""a shame and a disgrace."" The report, by Albert Q. Maisel, featured scathing anecdotes of routine abuse, starvation diets, overcrowded bathrooms and cynical charades of treatment that mocked the very word. ""Through public neglect and legislative penny-pinching, state after state has allowed its institutions for the care and cure of the mentally sick to degenerate into little more than concentration camps,"" Maisel wrote. Some 70 years later, the journalist Alisa Roth has written a chilling book that argues that American jails and prisons have become de facto warehouses for the mentally ill, and that conditions inside have hardly improved from the horrors Maisel uncovered. More than half the prisoners incarcerated in America suffer from some kind of mental illness, Roth writes. She cites a federal study that says 75 percent of women locked up are mentally ill. Yet the American prison system is woefully unprepared to offer treatment or provide even basic mental health care to its wards. The poor conditions inside are in fact making the sick even sicker. ""We're not psychiatrists,"" Alejandro Fernandez, a Los Angeles corrections official, tells Roth in one of the book's many interviews with front-line observers. ""We, as deputies, we know how to arrest people. We know how to put people in jail. We don't know how to take care of people with mental illness.""

Much has been written in recent years about the brutal racial disparity in American incarceration that has locked away generations of black men at a rate dramatically outpacing that of whites. Michelle Alexander makes the case as pointedly as anyone that mass incarceration is, as she calls it, ""The New Jim Crow."" In ""Insane,"" Roth is looking to frame the incarceration and treatment of the mentally ill as the next civil rights issue. Roth traces the long history of how we ended up with millions of incarcerated patients all the way back to Benjamin Franklin and the founding of the Republic. America has never quite known what to do with the mentally ill, and Roth argues that the latest solution -- lock them up! -- is the worst option of all: morally wrong, medically wrong and economically wrong. ""We continue to treat people with mental illness almost exactly as we did before electricity was invented, before women had the right to vote and before the abolition of slavery,"" she writes. ""Locking up vulnerable people in inhumane conditions is fundamentally immoral."" Want to keep up with the latest and greatest in books? This is a good place to start.

Roth paints a devastating portrait of lives wrecked -- or ended -- in prisons, stories of sick people who never got the treatment they needed outside, and certainly didn't receive it on the inside either. It's hard to read ""Insane"" without concluding that the way the criminal justice system has dealt with mental illness is profoundly broken, and that its flaws have led to tremendous anguish. There's the mentally ill Virginia man, arrested for stealing $5 of junk food, who was treated by corrections officers ""like a circus animal."" He died in jail, apparently of starvation.

There's the Florida man diagnosed with schizophrenia who fouled his cell with his own feces; he was punished with a ""special"" shower turned up to 160 degrees that practically boiled him alive over two hours, killing him. As Roth writes movingly of the human toll of incarceration, there's a central tension in the book between society's desire to punish lawbreakers, and the responsibility to care for the sickest among us. She argues that most mentally ill prisoners would be better served outside the prison system, and that most prisons would be cheaper and easier to manage without such a sick population. She convincingly diagnoses the glaring inadequacies of mental health treatment in prison -- she cites a Pennsylvania penitentiary where treatment consisted of distributing coloring books -- but she is not out for scapegoats. In fact, she writes sympathetically about prison officials being asked to do difficult, specialized work for which they're woefully unequipped. A dogged reporter who worked for years on the radio show ""Marketplace,"" Roth crisscrossed the country visiting jails and prisons. At times she lets her passion steer her arguments. She writes sympathetically of an Alabama prisoner ""who was barely five feet tall and slight, and, apart from having shot his mother, his only significant history of violence was against himself."" That's a pretty big ""apart."" Roth argues that many mentally ill prisoners are in jail for misdemeanors and minor violations like shoplifting or loitering, crimes that should have alerted mental health providers rather than pointed them toward prison. She ends a visit to a Los Angeles jail with this stark description: ""thousands of desperately sick people receiving minimal treatment for their mental health problems, being cared for by people with little training for that aspect of the job, and all this at great expense -- simply because they have been charged with a crime.""

""Insane"" is rife with sharp, brutal details that pull the reader beyond the realms of abstract policy debates. Roth describes the smell of jail: ""The pungency depends in part on how often the occupant is willing to submit to a shower and how many old milk cartons he is saving in his cell (a common practice) and whether his particular demons compel him to smear the wall with feces."" She describes a corrections officer who nonchalantly shows her a small hooked blade that hangs from his belt loop. He tells her it's a special tool for ""cutting down"" -- rescuing people who have tried to hang themselves. While Roth writes accessibly, her book can at times read like a study of Prison Best Practices as she compares the efficacy of various Rikers Island clinics with guidelines from the American Psychiatric Association. She mitigates this with collections of thumbnail profiles, most of them shattering, about mentally ill people made worse by the prison system. After so much despair, Roth ends with several promising examples from around the country where the intersection of mental illness and criminal justice has not proved devastating. Most interesting perhaps is the case of Steve Leifman, a Florida judge who runs a jail diversion program with a simple premise: When a person with a mental illness is arrested for a nonviolent misdemeanor, he or she can be steered toward treatment rather than criminal court. The vast majority opt for treatment, where they are connected with housing and other services. Recidivism is low, patients get the support they need, and the prison system saves significant funds. Leifman says that over the last decade he has managed to steer some 4,000 people out of the criminal justice system. That may sound like a small number compared with the scale of the national incarceration problem, and it is. But by the end of ""Insane,"" you are so aware of the suffering that just one mentally ill prisoner could endure that it's a relief to look for hope where you can find it.","In her new book, Alisa Roth details the way the criminal justice system makes the sick even sicker.",1c522714-2fc6-5e00-9a32-e7174e54327b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/27/books/review/27Dolnick/27Dolnick-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=595874d83e4b5cdaed7097ddab37661704e3b75b64f8a1803e67fb903b27536e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,An inmate at Alabama's St. Clair Prison.,1c522714-2fc6-5e00-9a32-e7174e54327b,N24News/imgs/1c522714-2fc6-5e00-9a32-e7174e54327b.jpg,13
Fashion & Style,London Fashion Week Partygoers Tear Up Dance Floor (and Tear Down a Wall),https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/21/fashion/london-fashion-week-marc-jacobs-love-magazine.html,"LONDON -- ""Where is your passport? I want your documentation now,"" demanded a thickset uniformed soldier with a heavy German accent, sitting on a velvet pouf in a shadowy subterranean nightclub. On the left, a pack of scowling punks in leathers leaned against a graffitied concrete wall. To the right, hordes of beautiful women in glitter and shoulder pads lounged, sipping cups of Champagne. ""Your passport, Fraulein,"" the Stasi soldier said again. Getting into parties during fashion week is often tough, but this took the experience to new extremes. Presumably, that was the point, at least as envisioned by Love magazine editors and Marc Jacobs, the party hosts who chose 1989 Berlin -- just before the wall came down -- as the theme for London Fashion Week's biggest bash, held Monday night at Loulou's, a members-only club in Mayfair.

After navigating the crowds of paparazzi outside, guests descended a rickety staircase before being sent either east or west of a giant model Berlin Wall that divided the cavernous dance floor in two. On one side, a clutch of starry attendees including Bella Hadid and Winnie Harlow, the makeup artist Charlotte Tilbury, the photographer Mert Alas and Mr. Jacobs, alongside the party co-hosts Katie Grand and Poppy Delevingne, nibbled on halibut, red cabbage and potato salad behind velvet ropes. On the other, hordes of models, designers and industry hangers-on sipped Moscow Mules whipped up by red-waistcoated, handlebar-mustachioed waiters at a Checkpoint Charlie bar (only if you had the right papers, of course). The club was heaving. The music was deafening. People were letting very loose.

""It's just blowing my mind -- this level of insanity is exactly what a fashion week should be,"" said the young British designer Matty Bovan, fresh from his well-received catwalk show on Saturday, who later took to the DJ decks with a friend and fellow designer, Charles Jeffrey. Mr. Bovan was clad in his signature New Romantic wares, squished between the photographer Ellen von Unwerth -- and his mother. ""I owe everything to her, she has been so endlessly supportive of me, of course I was going to bring her along,"" he said.

Mr. Bovan was not the only one to have a parent as a party accessory. Anna Cleveland, the model daughter of the model superstar Pat Cleveland, had brought along her father, Paul van Ravenstein. Frances Bean Cobain spoke intensely with her mother, the singer Courtney Love (both wearing Marc Jacobs). Then the neon lights flashed and the music was replaced by scratchy recordings of speeches, culminating in the one in 1987 in which President Reagan demanded that Mikhail Gorbachev, leader of the then-Soviet Union, ""tear down this wall."" The 21st-century party gods heard, and down came the wall, opening up the dance floor. Cara Delevingne and Clara Paget, fresh from the Burberry show, huddled in one corner with Amber Heard, Johnny Depp's ex-wife. Kate Moss, framed by her sister, Lottie, and her beau, Count Nikolai von Bismarck, sat in another. And Princess Beatrice, who was to host a breakfast for the fashion industry at Buckingham Palace bright and early Tuesday morning, held court in a third. There was no sign of Madonna, the latest Love cover star. But her 16-year-old son, Rocco Ritchie, was there, only to be bundled out of the club at 11 p.m. It was a school night, after all.","Love magazine recreated 1989 Berlin, complete with border guards, at Loulou's, a members-only club in Mayfair.",6ebfd1e4-25af-566e-a391-78d54ccb32c2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/09/20/fashion/21Love-web02/21Love-web02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=2396c62c4239e1e3e986b68ac6fe3d67db6e533a4cf7a48cbc69d80af96ac6d5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Marc Jacobs, one of the co-hosts of the Berlin 1989 party at Loulou's in London.",6ebfd1e4-25af-566e-a391-78d54ccb32c2,N24News/imgs/6ebfd1e4-25af-566e-a391-78d54ccb32c2.jpg,19
Sports,"For the N.H.L. Bubble to Succeed, Everyone Had to Be Flexible",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/25/sports/hockey/nhl-bubble-families.html,"For the N.H.L. Bubble to Succeed, Everyone Had to Be Flexible

EDMONTON, Alberta -- With the presentation of the Stanley Cup just days away, the N.H.L. will soon be able to take a victory lap for being the first of the four major North American pro sports leagues to complete a season during the coronavirus pandemic. The quality of the hockey has been solid, and the safety protocols have held, but an adaptable mind-set for all parties, from top executives to stadium workers, has been crucial for the expanded, 24-team postseason to work. Take Assunta Marozzi, who operates Fantasia Caffe and Catering in Edmonton, one of the two cities the N.H.L. used for its season restart. Her storefront location has been closed since coronavirus restrictions were introduced in Alberta in March, but her food truck has been operating inside the N.H.L.'s so-called bubble since late July, providing locally made gelato, specialty coffees and a menu of Italian-inspired dishes and daily international specials. The Fantasia staffers who enter the bubble each day, usually three to five, have had to be cautious: When they arrive, they each go through a temperature check, fill out a symptom survey and deliver a negative coronavirus test.

But they have had to be nimble, too: Marozzi noticed that as more teams headed home after elimination and more league staffers arrived from Toronto -- home to the second N.H.L. site -- and other locations, her clientele's tastes shifted. ""There were a lot more players in the initial phase, so we were tailoring to the athlete,"" Marozzi said. ""More salads and high-protein snacks. Now, with more teams departed, the demographic changes. We've adapted and been giving different types of specials."" While the 24/7 bubble residents -- players, team and league staff members, and medical officers, all labeled Category 1 or Category 2 participants -- are literally fenced inside a ""secure zone"" that includes two hotels and the arena in Edmonton, others, like Marozzi and her team, live off-site and enter the bubble to work. They are considered Category 3 and 4 -- staffers who have limited contact with players, including hotel housekeeping staff, security officers, ice crew members and others. Canada's lower overall rate of coronavirus infections was the primary reason the N.H.L. decided to set up its hub cities in Edmonton and Toronto. All told, 4,649 confirmed cases had been recorded in the Edmonton region through Tuesday. A handful of those were among Category 3 and 4 workers.

Daly's normal playoff routine has been disrupted, too. Usually, he and Commissioner Gary Bettman travel from series to series, taking in games. This year, they stayed close to their New York City home bases for much of the postseason because of the Canadian government's quarantine requirements. To be able to get on the ice last week in time to hand out the Clarence S. Campbell Bowl to the Western Conference champion Dallas Stars and the Prince of Wales Trophy to the Eastern Conference-winning Tampa Bay Lightning, Daly went through a process that echoed the protocols for players when they first moved to Toronto and Edmonton in late July. Before boarding a private flight to Edmonton with some other league staffers, Daly had to produce three negative tests during a seven-day period of home isolation. After touching down, he quarantined in his hotel room for four days, delivering a negative test each day. Only then could he integrate into the bubble. Bettman did the same, and he'll be on the ice to present the Conn Smythe Trophy to the most valuable player of the playoffs and hand the Stanley Cup to the winning team's captain (Tampa Bay leads the series two games to one). In an empty Rogers Place, however, he won't hear the usual chorus of boos from fans that has become tradition. Players and their families have also had to adapt to travel restrictions that ended up being much more strict than originally anticipated in early July. At the time, the return-to-play plan included provisions for family members to join players, beginning with the conference finals. On Sept. 11, the Dallas Stars posted a video on social media of the journeyman forward Justin Dowling reuniting with his wife, Meg, and their five-and-a-half-month-old baby, Perri, after they drove nearly 200 miles from their home in Cochrane, Alberta. Nearly a week later, Meg and Perri were still the only family members on site. Two days before the finals began, government authorities had yet to grant permission for family members from outside Canada to enter.

""They heard us out, they listened to us, they complimented us on the procedures and protocols that we have developed and certainly the experience, the success we've had,"" Daly said. ""They haven't said no yet, but obviously, at this point in time, it becomes difficult to execute. ""It may be that the clock simply runs out before we get an answer.""

For Corey Perry, who is seeking his second Stanley Cup ring as a 35-year-old veteran winger for the Stars, not being surrounded by family is a stark difference from 2007, when he won a championship as a rookie with the Anaheim Ducks. ""My first time in the final, we played Ottawa,"" he said on a video call with reporters before the finals. ""Pretty much three-quarters of my family is from Ottawa, so when we went there, there was a lot of people to see after the game."" Perry's only family this time around will be his wife, who arrived in Edmonton on Saturday and was scheduled to complete her quarantine on Wednesday. He said he was expecting to see her for the first time after Game 3. But he has appreciated other aspects of the tournament. ""It's obviously a little different than traveling back and forth across the country, that five-and-a-half, six-hour plane ride to get to Ottawa and back to California,"" he said. ""Everything's right here. It's just a matter of going out and playing hockey."" Adaptability has also been imperative for the broadcasters covering the tournament.",Broadcasters did interviews from high above the ice instead of rinkside. A popular cafe in Edmonton tailored its menu to athletes. And most players have gone weeks without seeing their families.,3962c881-de97-5070-a684-bdde4784eb4e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/25/sports/22nhl-bubble-print/22nhl-bubble-web-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=ec33932f91b9e1533dfb9fc8549abf22a8871eb6eddd550f8f50994aff90c12a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The N.H.L. restart that began in late July is down to two teams, Tampa Bay and Dallas.",3962c881-de97-5070-a684-bdde4784eb4e,N24News/imgs/3962c881-de97-5070-a684-bdde4784eb4e.jpg,9
Style,Miss Golden Globe Is No More. Long Live the Golden Globe Ambassador.,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/style/golden-globe-ambassador-johnson-simone-garcia.html,"Sistine Stallone, 19, still recalls the moment when she and her two sisters, Scarlet and Sophia, were summoned by their father, Sylvester Stallone, for a family meeting in their living room in Beverly Hills, Calif. ""I was like, 'uh oh,'"" she said, thinking they were grounded or something. But he had great news. ""He told us that we would all get to be Miss Golden Globe, and we started screaming."" The three Stallone sisters, each one as elongated as a Modigliani, were seen by some 20 million viewers when they helped pass out trophies at last year's Golden Globe Awards. Who knew the siblings would also usher out an affectionate but antiquated title?

""I'm so happy about the change because it's more inclusive and it promotes equality,"" Ms. Garcia Johnson said. ""I'm really passionate about those things."" The move is in step with the award industry's recent efforts to be more inclusive. ""Now, it's gender-neutral, and the ambassador could be a woman, a man, a transgender,"" said Anke Hofmann, vice president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which bestows the Golden Globes. Ms. Hofmann added that the group had been contemplating the name change, and adding more philanthropic duties, for a while.

This being Hollywood, there is fierce competition and campaigning by proud A-list parents for the role. The foreign press association was vague about the selection process, except to say that its board votes on which candidates are presented to the president, who makes the final pick. Greer Grammer, the daughter of Kelsey Grammer, first interviewed for the 2011 awards but lost out to Gia Mantegna. Three years later, Ms. Grammer expressed interest again and was told that she was chosen to be 2015 Miss Golden Globe.

Conversely, Corinne Foxx, daughter of Jamie Foxx, did not realize she was in the running to be the 2016 Miss Golden Globe 2016 until a call came ""out of the blue,"" she said. ""There's an enormous amount of anticipation to see who gets to do it,"" said Krista Smith, the executive West Coast editor of Vanity Fair. ""It's a gesture toward the new generation."" The tradition's track record of picking future stars is mixed, though there are notable exceptions. ""I think the H.F.P.A. looked at their crystal ball and thought I had a good shot,"" said Joely Fisher, the daughter of Connie Stevens and Eddie Fisher, who was Miss Golden Globe in 1992. Ms. Fisher went on to be nominated for a Golden Globe for her role on the TV show ""Ellen.""

Other former honorees have returned to the stage as winners. Melanie Griffith (1975) nabbed an award for ""Working Girl"" 14 years later; Laura Dern (1982) has racked up three wins and is nominated this year for ""Big Little Lies."" Nowadays, a thriving social media presence is perhaps as important as acting chops. ""We are keeping the tradition of a next-generation actor, who is also very involved with social media,"" Ms. Hofmann said. Ms. Garcia Johnson has 248,000 followers on Instagram, where she includes a link to a GoFundMe page for the legal defense fund for Time's Up, a new initiative for combating sexual harassment in Hollywood.","Simone Garcia Johnson, the daughter of Dwayne Johnson, takes over this year, with a new name for the ceremonial gig.",49468979-5946-5f50-bfa1-5a87e9138a2b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/fashion/07MISS-GG2/07MISS-GG2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=b1b1192e56bc018a05ff42d6b21809686ad72de06c75e5a5517eb136b50ed849&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Simone Garcia Johnson, Dwayne &ldquo;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson&rsquo;s daughter, is the first Golden Globe Ambassador.",49468979-5946-5f50-bfa1-5a87e9138a2b,N24News/imgs/49468979-5946-5f50-bfa1-5a87e9138a2b.jpg,15
Health,'It's Like Groundhog Day': Coronavirus Testing Labs Again Lack Key Supplies,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/23/health/coronavirus-testing-supply-shortage.html,"Just weeks after resolving shortages in swabs, researchers are struggling to find the chemicals and plastic pieces they need to carry out coronavirus tests in the lab -- leading to long waiting times.

Labs across the country are facing backlogs in coronavirus testing thanks in part to a shortage of tiny pieces of tapered plastic. Researchers need these little disposables, called pipette tips, to quickly and precisely move liquid between vials as they process the tests. As the number of known coronavirus cases in the United States passes 4 million, these new shortages of pipette tips and other lab supplies are once again stymieing efforts to track and curb the spread of disease. Some people are waiting days or even weeks for results, and labs are vying for crucial materials. ""That's the crazy part,"" said Dr. Alexander McAdam, director of the infectious diseases diagnostic laboratory at Boston Children's Hospital, one of many institutions seeking the prized pipette tips. ""Whenever there's a shortage, it's lab versus lab, city versus city, state versus state, competing for supplies.""

Fed into automated devices, pipette tips can help researchers blaze through hundreds of coronavirus tests in a matter of hours, sparing them grueling manual labor. The Swiss company Tecan, which supplies pipette tips for machines used by hundreds of laboratories in the United States, has been slammed with orders from U.S. customers in recent months, according to Martin Brandle, the firm's senior vice president of corporate communications and investor relations. The demand has been so high, he said, that Tecan has tapped into an emergency stash, and is racing to install new production lines that he hopes will double the company's output by fall. Pipette tips aren't the only laboratory items in short supply. Dwindling stocks of machines, containers and chemicals needed to extract or amplify the coronavirus's genetic material have clogged almost every point along the testing workflow. The crisis is an eerie echo of the early days of the pandemic, when researchers scrambled to find the swabs and liquids needed to collect and store samples en route to laboratories. ""It's like Groundhog Day,"" said Scott Shone, director of the North Carolina State Laboratory of Public Health. ""I feel like I lived this day four or five months ago.""

In New York, researchers running low on chemicals are running machines at half capacity as test specimens pile up at the door. In Florida, where cases are spiking, labs are reporting turnaround times of seven to 10 days. And in New Mexico, researchers at TriCore Reference Laboratories -- the state's largest medical laboratory -- have revved up testing in the days after deliveries arrive, only to find themselves hamstrung by faltering supplies at week's end. ""It's a merry-go-round of shortages,"" said Karissa Culbreath, the laboratory's scientific director of infectious disease, research and development. ""Just when we think we've dealt with one issue, another challenge pops up.""

TriCore and many other laboratories are now having to prioritize testing for the sickest patients, a trend that has troubled many as evidence mounts of the virus's ability to spread from infected people before symptoms appear, if they do at all. For months, experts have underscored the need for more widespread testing, particularly among elderly people and the most vulnerable racial and ethnic groups, to slacken the coronavirus's grip on the nation. In interviews, public and private lab staffers in a dozen states said they were exhausted from marathon days of running tests on a shoestring supply chain. Some are regularly working 12-hour days. Others are taking overnight shifts to babysit machines running never-ending batches of tests at full capacity. ""I've come in at 4 a.m., I've come in at 3 a.m.,"" said Felicia Rice, a laboratory technologist who conducts coronavirus tests at Mayo Clinic Arizona, where local demand has skyrocketed in lock step with the recent crest in cases.

As demand ratchets up, it's these commercial labs that have been left in a lurch. In a statement released on July 20, Quest noted that the dearth of equipment and chemicals comprised ""the most significant gating factor"" in its testing pipeline. And members of the American Clinical Laboratory Association, a group that represents many of the country's private labs, have lamented the spotty availability of materials like chemicals and pipette tips, Julie Khani, the organization's president, said in an email. ""Any one constriction in the chain of supply can suddenly create a bottleneck,"" Ms. Khani said. ""With more supplies and platforms, we could perform more testing, but the global supply chain remains constrained."" Sputtering supply chains have started to shunt the onus of testing from some private laboratories to their public counterparts, Peter Iwen, director of Nebraska's Public Health Laboratory, said in an email. ""We are now getting backlogged and will need to start rejecting specimens,"" he said.

In California, where the number of new cases has surged above 10,000 per day, regional public health laboratories, like the one in Sonoma County, are fighting tooth and nail to keep pace. ""We've been over capacity for a long time,"" said Rachel Rees, the institution's director of laboratory services. Dr. Rees's lab is currently processing samples from local hospitals that have run out of supplies. To avoid halting testing entirely, many laboratories are maintaining stocks to run multiple types of tests at once -- requiring technicians to maintain both the materials and mental wherewithal to perform many protocols, often at the same time. Researchers at Mayo Clinic Arizona must juggle four or five protocols; at TriCore, in New Mexico, that number has soared to seven. This sort of bet-hedging wasn't the norm for laboratories before, said Omai Garner, the director of clinical microbiology for the U.C.L.A. Health System, where he runs a laboratory of more than 100 people.

""No single manufacturer can give a laboratory enough tests to cover the entire volume they need to cover,"" said Dr. Garner, who is in the process of adding a fifth type of coronavirus test to his team's repertoire. Shortages are so widespread that even backup options don't always pan out. Marilyn Freeman, who is deputy director of Virginia's D.C.L.S. public health laboratory, said her team had been waiting months for its orders of machines that can automate coronavirus test processing, which would ease the burden on staff. Two of the devices in highest demand -- the Hologic Panther and Hologic Panther Fusion, the same ultraefficient robots that take Tecan's sought-after pipette tips -- most likely won't ship to Dr. Freeman's lab until the fall. What's more, some of the biggest issues from the early days of the pandemic haven't yet resolved. Erin Graf, who regularly clocks 80-hour weeks as the director of microbiology at Mayo Clinic Arizona, said her laboratory was still strained by an inconsistent supply of the specialized swabs needed to collect specimens -- an added stress on top of the new round of obstacles her team is contending with. ""We're used to dealing with challenges. We welcome challenges,"" Dr. Graf said. ""But it feels like the challenge is coming almost daily now."" As fall approaches, many researchers are growing increasingly worried that the flu season will exacerbate shortages. The coronavirus isn't the only pathogen circulating through the human population, or the only infection that laboratories need tools to test for. Though the C.D.C. and many private companies are currently developing tests that can detect multiple pathogens at once, the sheer volume of autumn illnesses is still expected to hit labs hard -- and may force some teams to delay testing for other infections. Already, labs like Dr. Graf's have had to cut corners with testing for sexually transmitted infections, in part because several manufacturers have had to pivot supply chains toward coronavirus testing. ""Some of the most basic tests that we do, we can't do anymore,"" Dr. Graf said. ""Every resource is going toward Covid. That's something we never would've thought would happen."" Shifts toward point-of-care coronavirus tests, which are fast and simple enough to perform without the need for specialized equipment, could ease some of the burden on laboratories. Pooled testing for the coronavirus, in which samples from multiple people are combined and analyzed in batches, could cut down on material consumption as well. But these tests are not yet in widespread use, and depend on many of the same manufacturing pipelines.

In New Mexico, TriCore's Dr. Culbreath worries that her next big shortage may be the laboratory's most valuable supply of all: its people. ""I worry about my own staff, and burnout. Their ability to take care of themselves,"" said Dr. Culbreath, who has pulled many weekend shifts and 10-hour days. Eventually, she'll ""find someone to manufacture a plastic pipette tip,"" she said. ""But I can't find someone with the years of training and certification of these amazing scientists.""","Just weeks after resolving shortages in swabs, researchers are struggling to find the chemicals and plastic pieces they need to carry out coronavirus tests in the lab — leading to long waiting times.",f07ba763-4f01-538f-b5e1-da2efff7c2c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/23/science/23VIRUS-TESTINGSHORTAGES1/23VIRUS-TESTINGSHORTAGES1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=88e6b7336f27a16d9b0239433191588fb1770c0424d3cb25b8ac6e218d95043d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A lab technician prepared coronavirus specimens for testing at a Quest Diagnostics facility in Chantilly, Va., in April.",f07ba763-4f01-538f-b5e1-da2efff7c2c3,N24News/imgs/f07ba763-4f01-538f-b5e1-da2efff7c2c3.jpg,1
Food,A Hotelier Who Knows How to Make Chefs Feel at Home,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/27/dining/ian-schrager-john-fraser.html,"There are few phrases in the dining lexicon less inviting than ""hotel restaurant,"" a term that has traditionally called up images of serviceable food in corporate settings.

But the veteran hotelier Ian Schrager seems to have sidestepped all that. Over the years, he has been able to attract marquee chefs to run the restaurants and food services in his global portfolio of hotels. Decades ago, he hired accomplished chefs like Larry Forgione and Claude Troisgros, and he's still at it, with Jean-Georges Vongerichten and Jason Atherton running his kitchens.

Mr. Schrager's latest recruit is John Fraser, who will be executive chef for the Times Square Edition hotel, now under construction on Seventh Avenue at 47th Street. In the 1990s, Mr. Fraser was a cook at Mr. Schrager's Mondrian hotel in Los Angeles.

Opinion,The G.O.P. Tosses Steve King Overboard,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/01/opinion/steve-king-iowa-republican.html,"Steve King, the suicidally outspoken Republican representing Iowa's Fourth Congressional District, is facing the first serious primary challenge of his 17-year congressional career. He has little to show for his time in Congress. He has been stripped of his committee assignments, he's out of campaign cash and has few friends in Congress. The state and national party have all but abandoned him. Some may find it odd that in the era of Donald Trump, Republicans are drawing the line at Mr. King. But party leaders sense they must move away from him and what he represents. He seems laboratory-designed to alienate donors and the moderate suburban women the party needs in November. Mr. Trump, in some ways, gets a free pass. No such allowance is made for Mr. King. Mr. King's long history of racist, sexist and generally offensive comments is by now well known. He's referred to immigrants as ""dirt,"" and said in an interview with Newsmax in 2013 that ""for every one who's a valedictorian, there's another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they've got calves the size of cantaloupes because they're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert."" The Republican move to unseat Mr. King picked up after his comments last year to The New York Times in which he questioned why white supremacy should be considered ""offensive,"" which led conservative outlets to editorialize against him.

Soon after, the House Republican leaders Kevin McCarthy and Liz Cheney took away Mr. King's committee seats, tired of having to answer for his musings on rape, anti-Semitic conspiracy theories, and endorsement of white nationalists. Ms. Cheney said last year that Mr. King ought to ""find another line of work."" With a toxic plume surrounding Mr. King, party regulars are instead supporting a three-term Iowa state senator, Randy Feenstra, one of five primary candidates in the district. Mr. Feenstra is a pro-Trump, anti-abortion small-town businessman. Among his backers are the executives Douglas DeVos and Daniel DeVos (brothers-in-law of the education secretary, Betsy DeVos), the hedge-funder Dan Loeb, the former Iowa governor (now ambassador to China) Terry Branstad and the Republican operative Karl Rove. Mr. Rove told me that the move to challenge Mr. King was a long time coming, and that he's distributed to friends a letter supporting Mr. Feenstra. The seat has ""become vulnerable because we've had too many years of outrageous comments that reflect badly on him and the Republican Party."" The effort to dump Mr. King is in equal parts high-minded and political. ""He's taken a safe Republican seat, and made it possible for the Democrats to grab it away,"" Mr. Rove observed. That's part of the political calculation that has party benefactors and leaders exercised. It's time to change course, according to a strategist supporting the Feenstra campaign. ""Let's get really talented young conservatives in there like Elise Stefanik, Dan Crenshaw, Mike Waltz and Mike Gallagher,"" the strategist said, and ""get rid of the bad actors"" like Mr. King.

This would explain, in part, why President Trump this month endorsed candidates in two Republican primaries in Iowa, but conspicuously ignored Mr. King. In 2018, Mr. King won the solidly Republican Fourth by only 3.3 percentage points -- a total of about 10,000 votes against his Democratic challenger, J.D. Scholten. (Mr. King won the seat by more than 22 points in 2016). Mr. Trump took the same district in 2016 by a 27-point margin. But Mr. King wasn't always so offensively outspoken. Over his past few congressional terms, Mr. King has become fixated on things far from the interests of his constituents. And his constituents know it. In 2018, at a town hall event I attended in Webster City, voters wondered why he was traveling to Europe to meet with far-right figures. They also raised questions about his lifestyle in Washington -- expensive meals and the like. These Iowa voters, then, wouldn't be surprised to learn that Mr. King has been paying his son Jeff several thousand dollars a month to manage his campaign, as he has in past years. Mr. King's daughter-in-law is also on the campaign's payroll. But it's Mr. King's turn away from the district and toward divisive and racial issues that has really turned off his constituents. Bob Vander Plaats, an evangelical Iowa political broker, has called the congressman ""embarrassing"" and said the district deserves better. He's endorsed Mr. Feenstra and appears in ads playing in Iowa's Fourth. ""Whatever you think of Steve King, it's clear he's no longer effective,"" Mr. Vander Plaats says in the advertisement. ""He can't deliver for President Trump, and he can't advance our conservative values."" Mr. King wrote two weeks ago in a newspaper op-ed essay that it's the ""billionaire coastal RINO-NeverTrumper, globalist, neocon elites"" who support Mr. Feenstra. Mr. Rove said the opposite is true. ""The people trying to take him down are ordinary people of western Iowa who are sick and tired of a showboater, not a workhorse, and by Republicans around the country who are offended by his remarks and by how badly it reflects on the Republican Party,"" he said. ""In reality, if he was doing his job representing the people of his district he wouldn't have any primary opponents, let alone four.""","The Iowa congressman is too much, even for the party of Donald Trump.",48cb7aa9-0e5d-50eb-af45-95cac0e0074b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/01/opinion/01rub1/01rub1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c3ef33307e77c62341de0007269f16e4e6d39964fd92f378d1eb2fdc16f17b9f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Representative Steve King lost his committee assignments after comments in which he questioned why white supremacy is considered offensive.,48cb7aa9-0e5d-50eb-af45-95cac0e0074b,N24News/imgs/48cb7aa9-0e5d-50eb-af45-95cac0e0074b.jpg,11
Opinion,The Anti-Israel Craze Hits High School,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/opinion/antisemitism-college.html,"We recently spoke to some 500 high school students, teachers and administrators at Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx. As the senior rabbis of two major Reform synagogues with which dozens of Fieldston families are affiliated, we presented the Jewish community's perspectives on the surge in anti-Semitic incidents in our area and throughout the country. We clarified that while we do not claim to represent all Jews, our views do fall within mainstream Jewish opinion.

We shared statistics from the New York City police and the F.B.I. about the pervasiveness of attacks against Jews. We also addressed the controversy that had erupted in the aftermath of Fieldston's November assembly, in which a guest speaker equated Israelis with Nazis and asserted that Israelis are an example of ""victims becoming the perpetrators."" Several hours after we spoke last week, Fieldston fired a teacher who had posted tweets demonizing Zionism. Students reported that while we were speaking, the teacher flipped a middle finger at one of us.

We are deeply worried about the effect that hatred of Israel has on students. We emphasized in our remarks that for centuries, anti-Semitism emerged from both the right and the left of the political spectrum. We described what far-right anti-Semitism looks like, but, since we are liberal rabbis, we spent most of our time discussing anti-Semitism among the left. It's especially important for us to speak against hate in our own camp. We stated emphatically that criticism of Israel is not necessarily anti-Semitic. To the contrary: it is often helpful and motivated by sound principles.

But to accuse Holocaust survivors of inflicting Nazi-like violence on others, as the guest speaker at Fieldston had, is morally grotesque. It whitewashes the Nazis' crimes and who they really were to accuse Jews of the very things that were done to them in an effort to defame the Jewish state.",A movement to demonize Israel corrupts the academy.,5a01182c-8a7d-5b91-8991-dc7573b2da21,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/16/opinion/16DavidsonHirsch/16DavidsonHirsch-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=e13b68237c3fcbeda30dc870c48a9a6184c38db3906d64ef83315067c635096f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Ethical Culture Fieldston School in the Bronx.,5a01182c-8a7d-5b91-8991-dc7573b2da21,N24News/imgs/5a01182c-8a7d-5b91-8991-dc7573b2da21.jpg,11
Movies,"'To the Stars' Review: Rebels in Bobby Socks, Yearning for More",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/movies/to-the-stars-review.html,"It's the early 1960s in rural Oklahoma, where the wind really does sweep down the plain, just like the song says. There, the teenage Iris (Kara Hayward), a bookish introvert, is trying to keep her head down. The only child of a rancher and a bored, restless housewife (Shea Whigham and Jordana Spiro), Iris is a loner, though it's unclear if that's by choice or inclination. Some nights, she runs off to a swimming hole, where she floats under a canopy of stars. She's primed for some kind of change, which arrives with Maggie (Liana Liberato), a spirited newcomer with a murky past. A drifty, overly sleepy coming-of-age story, ""To the Stars"" (which starts streaming Friday) tracks the inevitable friendship that arises the moment that Maggie appears onscreen to defend Iris from some bullies. It takes Iris a while to warm to Maggie, partly because Iris's mother has done a number on her self-esteem. She isn't used to kindness from other people, especially those her own age. But Maggie is one of those somewhat sainted free spirits who light up everyday dreariness (at least in the movies), stirring things up while inspiring clucks of disapproval and censure.

Like almost everything else in this movie, Maggie is at once likable and exceedingly familiar. Part of the character's appeal comes from the alluring tug of the rebel, the figure who promises freedom and who will blaze intensely before flaming out or burning her world to the ground. Whatever happens, you know that something has to give; it always does. And it's this expectation of trouble ahead that gives the story its light pulse, enlivening both the proceedings and Iris as she follows her genre destiny: With Maggie's help, Iris blooms and experiences joy, discovers a fragile sense of self-worth and then suffers the inevitable heartache and disappointment.

The director Martha Stephens, working from a script by Shannon Bradley-Colleary, handles this material smoothly, creating a solid, tangible sense of place with landscapes, gusts of wind and a blue sky that feels more confining than sheltering. Stephens, whose movies include ""Land Ho!"" (directed with Aaron Katz), is particularly sensitive to Iris's surroundings, her family's weather-beaten house and barn, and the dusty road where Maggie rescues her. In one scene, Maggie and Iris take off down that road in a car, enjoying a much-needed if frustratingly brief escape. Then it's back to their mean little town with its small-minded dictators and frustrated, hothouse desires. It's always nice to see characters break free, but you need to care whether they do. One insurmountable problem with this story is that Iris just isn't interesting enough and certainly not developed enough either as a character or in terms of the performance. She isn't simply closed off, like a turtle in lockdown; she's devoid of spark, personality, and it leaves you searching for someone to care about. Maggie fits that role for a while. But the movie's great missed opportunity can be found at a beauty parlor, where another loner, Hazel (a very good Adelaide Clemens), styles hair and opens up another world with a few words, darting looks and gentle, seductive grace.

Theater,"'Gotham Refuses to Get Scared': In 1918, Theaters Stayed Open",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/14/theater/spanish-flu-1918-new-york-theater.html,"War plays were big on Broadway in the fall of 1918. With the nation sending soldiers to Europe to fight in World War I, spectacles like the ""Ziegfeld Follies"" wrapped themselves in patriotism. The runaway hit of the season, though, was the kind of distraction that people relish in troubled times. They flocked to see a play called ""Lightnin': A Live Wire American Comedy"" at the Gaiety Theater, on the edge of Times Square. Even as a lethal influenza pandemic took hold of the city, audiences came. Settled into the seats, they must have laughed and laughed. Sounds dangerous to us now, right? It sounded dangerous even then. As the flu spread that year and the next, eventually killing about 675,000 people across the United States, city after city raced to contain the threat by shuttering theaters and other places of public amusement. Hollywood vowed to release no more films until the flu subsided.

""Gotham Refuses to Get Scared,"" an early October headline declared in The Baltimore Sun, which noted that despite 2,070 new cases of flu and 283 of pneumonia in the previous 24 hours in New York City, its health department had announced ""that the epidemic has not reached an alarming stage."" Its brief, steep spike was about to start. But quelling dismay was part of the city's strategy -- an effort to keep the public's spirits up. Amid our own pandemic, which since March has disrupted American life and largely paralyzed live performance, it sounds almost unreal that New York theater in 1918 simply carried on. When I mentioned that history to Charlotte St. Martin, the president of the Broadway League, she asked, ""Are you sure?""

""It seems nuts,"" she said, adding that the industry's response to the coronavirus had been unhesitating. ""We didn't even think about it a minute. Once it became clear that this was here, the first case we got on Broadway, we shut that night. Literally that night."" Royal S. Copeland, the powerful health commissioner of New York City when the Spanish flu crept in, looked askance at pandemic responses elsewhere. While the nation's surgeon general, Rupert Blue, encouraged localities to close theaters as a preventive measure, Copeland was philosophically disinclined to intrude much on ordinary life. He also didn't want to freak people out. ""My aim was to prevent panic, hysteria, mental disturbance,"" he said later, ""and thus to protect the public from the condition of mind that in itself predisposes to physical ills."" Howard Markel, the director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan, said Copeland ""had the faith of the people"" as he steered the city through the outbreak -- shuttering almost nothing, including the schools. Without a ban on public gatherings, New York was ""a big outlier"" among sizable American cities, Markel said. Instead of closing theaters, Copeland staggered their curtain times, assigning each to a group. The Hippodrome, for example, started at 8 p.m., the Winter Garden at 8:15, the Lyric at 8:30, the Booth at 8:45 and the Belasco at 9.

In a pre-television, pre-talkies age, theater was a more everyday pleasure. Soldiers on leave flocked to live shows; free tickets for them were seen as a necessity. ""War Service Director Says No Soldier Should Lack Food, Shelter, and Entertainment,"" read one headline in The New York Times. Neighborhood theaters and vaudeville houses were scattered through the city. That fall, the number of ""first-class houses"" had reached a high of 45. But while the virus lurked, some changes were needed. At theaters and cinemas, standing-room tickets were no longer allowed; smoking wasn't, either. Masks were not mandated, but Copeland was ruthless about the need to ""eliminate the sneezers, coughers and spitters"" from the audience. Using performances as opportunities for health education, he ordered theater managers to make preshow announcements explaining the danger of infection and detailing the new prohibitions. He told them ""to instruct their ushers and attendants to escort from their theaters those who violate the department rules, and to use force if necessary."" ""We will back them up,"" Copeland promised, ominously. Those ushers and attendants were to boot sneezers, coughers and spitters right out. Copeland's militancy on that point anticipated a worry that 21st-century theatergoers cited in a survey this spring about what would keep them from returning to Broadway once it reopens: ""a lack of trust that others in the audience will adhere to safety protocols.""

But as J. Alexander Navarro, a historian and an editor of the online Influenza Encyclopedia, pointed out, the pull-together spirit of wartime helped coax Americans in 1918 to alter their behavior. ""It's hard to measure,"" he said in a phone interview, ""but I think there was definitely a much higher sense of civic duty and nationalism and patriotism, compared to today."" The few theaters that Copeland did shut down, quietly, were what he called ""hole-in-the-wall moving-picture shows,"" judged to risk infection with unhealthy air. In ""the big modern sanitary theaters,"" he said, he was confident of the ventilation. How misplaced his faith was is unclear; probably, Navarro said, some people did come away infected. It would be interesting, he mused, to re-create the conditions of a typical theater, to see how far from a given seat a person's breath would have spread back then. Which is just the sort of thought that flashes through people's minds these days when they think about sitting in an audience again.

Before the flu started wreaking its havoc, producers' biggest worry had been the proposed doubling of a hefty war tax on theater tickets -- a move they tried to shame senators out of by reminding them that the enemy, the German kaiser, had at least one positive feature: his staunch support of the stage. It wasn't until late September that The Times's Sunday drama column, What News on the Rialto?, mentioned the flu. The worry was not about bustling Broadway but about poor Boston, one of the first American cities hit by the virus's deadly second wave. Its theaters had just been closed, leaving touring companies to languish. Only two weeks later, though, ""theatrical men"" were blaming a dent in some New York shows' box office on twin factors: the latest war-bond drive, which they had loudly dreaded, and the flu, which sneaked up on them. A week after that, the industry news was almost uniformly grim, with New York and San Francisco the rare ""communities of consequence"" with stages still open for business. ""The condition, of course, is one unprecedented in the theater world,"" The Times's column opined. ""The slump in New York reached its high mark -- or low mark -- during the last six days, and even the most substantial successes had empty seats."" Then, abruptly, the crisis was over in New York. By early November, as the war ended, the virus loosened its hold on the city. By the middle of the month, with emergency rules rescinded, ticket sales headed up again, and Actors' Equity reached a new contract agreement with theater managers. (It is a curious fact that actors worked through the flu outbreak, but contemporary Equity declined to discuss it for this article.) As the December holidays approached, the city's box-office revenues returned to glowing health. ""The same hardly applies to the remainder of the country,"" What News on the Rialto? added darkly, ""particularly the West, where the renascent influenza germ is again beginning to play havoc."" What Copeland did right, Navarro said, was to act early, employing stringent isolation and quarantine measures for the infected, enforced by what he called ""a very well-funded, very efficient, well run, longstanding public health department.""

Still, more than 20,000 New Yorkers died in the influenza pandemic of 1918 -- about the same number who have died in the city so far from the coronavirus. Yet Copeland's unorthodox approach resulted in New York having a lower death rate from the flu than any other large city on the East Coast, Markel said. ""I would have closed the theaters, absolutely,"" said Markel, a physician and historian who edits the Influenza Encyclopedia with Navarro. ""So it was kind of a bold move. But he was a very bold guy, and a very opinionated guy."" Had New York shuttered businesses and schools, Navarro speculated, it would have fared even better. ""But given that they didn't bring the city's economy to a halt,"" he said, ""what they did was very effective."" None of this is to suggest that present-day New York should have acted any differently than it has in response to Covid-19. As Navarro pointed out, coronavirus carriers can be asymptomatic -- while the 1918 flu, though less contagious, ravaged its victims so severely that they were more likely to be home suffering than out mingling. Copeland, a politically savvy homeopath who later became a Democratic senator for New York, had his own sense of what was essential to the public health. To him, it was of prime importance that people be able to ""go about their business without constant fear and hysterical sense of calamity."" And in 1918, keeping playhouses open was a way of maintaining calm. In 2020 New York, keeping them open likely would have done the opposite. Reopening them too soon could do that, too.

""We'd love to be back tomorrow,"" St. Martin, the Broadway League president, said. ""But we will never put our casts, crew and audience in harm's way if we can help it."" ""If we come back,"" she added, ""we will be back because we believe that we've done everything we can, and that those people are safe."" Given the brutal damage current pandemic has wrought, Gotham for now is OK with being scared.","With an influenza pandemic and a war on, New York's health commissioner took an unorthodox stand, declining to shutter public entertainment.",a21676b4-90d4-5397-ba89-e876d781ec05,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/19/arts/19flu-theaters-2/19flu-theaters-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=70872272ddbc27bd8f73a7c6eb14c06f220138b4e9036ea5b2418e1b88137538&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The show did go on: The 1918 Ziegfeld Follies featured Lillian Lorraine, center, with from left, W.

Science,What Was Kept in This Stone Age Meat Locker? Bone Marrow,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/science/marrow-israel-cave.html,"Sealed for millenniums, Qesem Cave in central Israel is a limestone time capsule of the lives and diets of Paleolithic people from 420,000 to 200,000 years ago. Inside, ancient humans once butchered fresh kills with stone blades and barbecued meat on campfires. ""It was believed that early hominins were consuming everything they could put their hands on immediately, without storing or preserving or keeping things for later,"" said Ran Barkai, an archaeologist at Tel Aviv University in Israel. But not every meal was scarfed down right after a hunt. Dr. Barkai and his colleagues have found that the cave's earliest inhabitants may have also stored animal bones filled with tasty marrow that they feasted on for up to nine weeks after the kill, sort of like a Stone Age canned soup. The finding may be the earliest example of prehistoric humans saving food for later consumption, and may also offer insight into the abilities of ancient humans to plan for their future needs. The study was published Wednesday in Science Advances.

Dr. Barkai's team examined cut marks on nearly 82,000 animal fragments from Qesem Cave, most belonging to fallow deer. The researchers noticed unusual, heavy chop marks on the ends of some leg bones known as the metapodials. The chop marks ""make no sense in terms of stripping off the bone , because at this part of the bone there is no meat and very little fat,"" Dr. Barkai said. Usually, stripping the hide from a fresh bone requires minimal force, he said. But the heavy chops indicated that the processing used more force than should have been necessary. ""We had a hypothesis that these unusual chop marks at the end of the meatless bones had to do with the removal of dry skin,"" he said. But why were they doing that?

That presented another question: If they were after marrow, why not just remove it from the bone when it was fresh? The researchers hypothesized that the chop marks were an indication that the early humans stored the bones so they could eat the marrow later. To test their idea, the team collected freshly killed deer leg bones and then stored them for several weeks in conditions similar to those inside the cave. After every week, they would break open a bone and analyze the marrow to see how nutritious it still was. Every time, a researcher would remove the dried skin using a flint flake and then hammer open the bone with a quartzite tool, similar to what the ancient people would have had used. The researcher wasn't given instructions on how to open the bone. The team found that the researcher's chop marks on the older leg bones with dried skin were similar to what they saw in Qesem Cave. ""It was a surprise when we realized that the same marks were generated experimentally,"" said Ruth Blasco, a zooarchaeologist at the National Research Centre on Human Evolution in Spain and lead author on the study. ""The Qesem hominids have demonstrated very modern behavior in their livelihood strategies."" Their chemical test showed that after nine weeks, the fat in the bone marrow degraded only a little and was still nutritious.

Jessica Thompson, an archaeologist at Yale University, said the paper was a creative approach to reconstructing a past behavior that is notoriously difficult to identify in the archaeological record. ""Their experimental work does a lot to convince me that some of the bones were not very fresh when they were processed, although it is still not clear how common this behavior was,"" Dr. Thompson said. Briana Pobiner, a paleoanthropologist at the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History, praised the study and said that if this removal of dry skin did leave a unique butchery mark , ""it's now up to us zooarchaeologists to look for these traces in older fossil assemblages to see if we can document a greater antiquity of this food storage behavior."" As for the marrow, how did it taste? One of the researchers couldn't resist trying it. ""It is like a bland sausage, without salt, and a little stale,"" said Jordi Rosell, an archaeologist at Rovira i Virgili University in Spain. ""I can say that its taste was not bad, perhaps a little more rancid in the last weeks, but not bad.""","In an Israeli cave, paleoarchaeologists unearthed what may be the earliest example of humans storing food for later consumption.",a5b7ea55-6e16-5ed0-a5cd-030a79be162a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/09/science/09TB-BONEMARROW1/09TB-BONEMARROW1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=1e1874e9e8cb3d732faa19cb16baed6fcad2ebb6f02c46bbf21c0f5fbd86ee7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The ends of deer leg bones, stored in conditions that simulated how they were kept in a cave in Israel during the Stone Age by ancient humans.
