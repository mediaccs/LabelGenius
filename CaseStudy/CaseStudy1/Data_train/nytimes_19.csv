Television,The Rise of 'Schitt's Creek',https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/07/arts/television/schitts-creek-final-season.html,"Credit...Ryan Pfluger for The New York Times



TORONTO -- ""You take such good care of your hands,"" Daniel Levy marveled as he waited for the director to call ""action."" It was the last day of spring, and the last week of filming for the sixth and final season of ""Schitt's Creek,"" which premiered January 7 on Pop. During a lull between takes, Levy, one of the show's creators and stars, admired his scene partner's nails. ""I'm a little obsessed,"" said the actress, Genelle Williams, who was playing a chef. His response was swift: ""So we all should be!"" Levy wears many hats: showrunner, actor, writer, editor, costume designer. Later that day, during a break on set -- a glass-walled cafe ringed by trees in Toronto's East End, which was standing in for a catering business -- he sat scrolling through his phone, putting together a playlist for the show's wrap party the next night. Levy's music selection was both an annual tradition and a welcome distraction from the end of an era. ""It's hectic,"" he said, ""which has actually helped a lot."" The Roses, the formerly wealthy, fish-out-of-water family at the heart of ""Schitt's Creek,"" are notoriously allergic to sentiment. But the people who play them -- Daniel Levy (David), Annie Murphy (Alexis), Catherine O'Hara (Moira, the imperious matriarch) and Eugene Levy (the paterfamilias, Johnny) -- were less so as the show neared its end. A weepy read-through of the final two episodes left O'Hara looking ""like Alice Cooper,"" she said. Others found themselves breaking down more randomly.

""Annie and I just text each other out of the blue,"" Daniel Levy said. ""'So I cried today at the grocery store. How are you?'"" But even though ""Schitt's Creek"" is wrapping up just as it has achieved something like mainstream success, the stars and creators remain convinced that it's the right time to say goodbye. ""Isn't that the perfect way to go?"" Eugene Levy said. ""We're on an upward trajectory, and we will be still on an upward trajectory when this series actually wraps.""

Thanks to a daffy charm -- a winning combination of its characters' caustic wit and the show's fundamental warmth -- and enthusiastic word-of-mouth support, the series rose from humble origins to the pinnacle of TV acclaim. In July 2019, a few months after the creators announced its next season would be its last, ""Schitt's Creek"" was nominated for four Emmys, including best comedy. O'Hara and Eugene Levy -- Daniel's father onscreen and off -- were already familiar faces when ""Schitt's Creek"" premiered. But the show's success has been a launchpad for the younger Levy, who signed a three-year overall deal with ABC Studios in 2019. Murphy, mostly unknown before ""Schitt's Creek,"" said the sitcom also has changed her life. ""The show has opened a lot of doors,"" she said, ""and I'm trying to look at the future not as a daunting bleak abyss of hell, but an exciting adventure."" The final season is the most ambitious yet, Daniel Levy said. The Roses have finally settled in the town they never thought they'd call home -- in fact, they're thriving both professionally and in their relationships. But will their achievements propel them beyond Schitt's Creek? Levy began thinking about an ending some time in Season 3. When Pop gave the show a two-season extension after Season 4, that struck him as a good opportunity to map out the conclusion he had in mind and go out on a high note. ""From start to finish our show will be exactly what it was intended to be,"" he said. ""The biggest mistake you can make in TV is shifting the focus away from characters and the storytelling to servicing audience expectations. The audience is there because you've done something right.""

Levy says the show's distance from the Hollywood hoopla gives him a certain level of freedom as a storyteller. ""We operate very much in an isolated bubble up in Canada,"" he said. Inspired by a curiosity about the lives of the ultrawealthy -- and the time Kim Basinger bought a small town in Georgia in the late 1980s -- he created ""Schitt's Creek"" with his father and shopped it around to American cable and broadcast networks, which all passed. Eventually they cobbled together funding -- first they made a deal with the CBC, then Europe's ITV Studios came on as distributor and, finally, Pop rounded out the budget. The arrangement left the Levys with an unusual degree of creative control. Eugene Levy was in the writers' room for the first couple seasons, but by Season 3, he began to step back and cede authority to his son.

""Schitt's Creek"" has enjoyed a steady if unlikely rise. It's been the rare series to see its audience grow every season -- between its first and fourth seasons, the show's ratings on Pop more than doubled. Netflix rarely releases viewership numbers for individual shows, but according to Pop, more than four million people watched at least some of the fifth season on its channel. The growth was in part thanks to a Webby Award-winning promotional strategy of flooding social media with ""Schitt's Creek"" references and amplifying fan enthusiasm by having both the stars' Twitter accounts and the show's official one retweet and respond to user-generated GIFs and memes. (When the Emmy nominations were announced, the show tweeted a GIF of Moira declaring that her favorite season is ""awards."") ""Schitt's Creek"" also has been a beacon for L.G.B.T.Q. viewers, thanks to its casually progressive depiction of a community devoid of homophobia and to the poignant love story between David and his business-partner-turned-fiance. ""I want to feel like I'm putting something out into the world that's of consequence,"" Levy said. ""It is a comedy, but there's a bit of weight to it. In our own little way we're taking a stand."" Eugene Levy said that his son's ""sensibility has really carried the show into a lovely area of recognition, in terms of critical recognition, in terms of emotional recognition, what he's done for the L.G.B.T.Q. community.""

""It's all 'Schitt's Creek' related,"" he said. ""So I know the saturation level on the show is getting thicker."" ""Schitt's Creek"" grew stronger as the Roses became more enmeshed in the show's namesake town, which Johnny once bought for David as a joke. The humor comes from the contrast between the flamboyant Roses and the pragmatic townspeople, but that's also where ""Schitt's Creek"" found its heart. Moira joins the town's singing group and directs a play; Alexis falls in love and goes back to school; David opens a posh general store; and Johnny partners with the motel's sardonic receptionist, Stevie (Emily Hampshire), and takes over the inn. ""Over and above, the main thing about this show was how the Roses have developed as a family,"" Eugene Levy said. As O'Hara put it during a break in filming, ""It's like we're aliens learning how to be humans."" The production had moved to its second location of the day, a small recording studio where Moira had a gig performing voice-overs -- a job secured by Alexis, who became her mother's publicist in the fifth season. O'Hara and Murphy took their places in the recording booth. ""You look so professional, Alexis!"" O'Hara exclaimed in her signature Moira accent -- a mid-Atlantic patois in which certain syllables are inexplicably elongated and others abruptly cut off. ""My bebe!""

A few days earlier, the production had finished shooting on location in the hamlet of Goodwood, Ontario, the site of the Schitt's Creek restaurant, town hall, auto shop and David's general store. On a Sunday afternoon in June, dozens of fans had gathered in Goodwood, about an hour outside Toronto, to bid farewell to ""Schitt's Creek"" -- an event billed as ""SchittCon."" Murphy said she and Daniel Levy were emotionally wrecked after leaving those sets. ""As cheesy as it sounds,"" she said, ""they have come to be really familiar, happy places over the years."" Back in his trailer, Levy had changed out of his costume -- drop-crotch gray sweats and a black sweatshirt emblazoned with ""ICON"" in white block lettering -- and into his own clothes, a gray crew neck and black jeans. His scenes finished for the day, he sat with an iced coffee sweating on the table before him and contemplated the end of ""Schitt's Creek."" While he's aware that the show is likely to receive more attention than ever before in its final season, he also knows that stunning twists and big narrative swings have never been the ""Schitt's Creek"" style. Much like his onscreen alter ego, Levy no longer feels the pressure to prove himself. He's learned that sometimes that simplest approach is best. ""What I wanted for our series finale was just a great [expletive] episode of TV,"" he said. ""I think that's all people want. They don't need a huge fireworks display. They just want to know that the characters are going to be O.K.""","The series is wrapping up just as it achieved something like mainstream success. For its creators and stars, that's the perfect time to go.",891865b3-68fa-539d-b7bf-dc56ce4ab9e0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/12/arts/12schitts-creek1/12schitts-creek1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=f531dc8821c9fb30e646c6ca35d782346649dc61c87567702eef8c41f1edf573&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from left, the stars of ""Schitt's Creek"": Annie Murphy, Eugene Levy, Catherine O'Hara and Daniel Levy.",891865b3-68fa-539d-b7bf-dc56ce4ab9e0,N24News/imgs/891865b3-68fa-539d-b7bf-dc56ce4ab9e0.jpg,3
Music,BAM's Outgoing Leader Announces His Final Next Wave Festival,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/21/arts/music/bam-next-wave-festival-2018.html,"The Brooklyn Academy of Music on Monday unveiled the lineup of the final Next Wave Festival to be overseen by Joseph V. Melillo, the institution's executive producer and a vital connection to its reputation as a home of cutting-edge music, theater and dance.

Mr. Melillo, who was hired by the visionary BAM leader Harvey Lichtenstein in 1983 and eventually succeeded him, announced in 2017 that he would step down from his leadership role at the end of this year, after more than three decades as a pathbreaking impresario. (Still to come is Mr. Melillo's final winter-spring season, which will be announced in the fall.)

""The original Next Wave concept, envisioned by Harvey Lichtenstein, remains vital and dynamic,"" Mr. Melillo, who was the festival's founding director, said in a statement. ""The season comprises a broad array of wondrous personal expression and unique artistic perspectives.""

Among the world premieres is ""Place"" (Oct. 11-13), a staged oratorio by the Pulitzer Prize finalist Ted Hearne, which was meant to have its premiere with the Los Angeles Philharmonic in April. (The performance was canceled because of ""unforeseen delays in the creative process."") The work, for 18 instrumentalists and six singers, explores themes around gentrification, ownership and the American experience.","This fall's music, theater and dance performances will be the last ones overseen by Joseph V. Melillo, an impresario at the institution since 1983.",cf76093e-b973-57fa-a82f-3b5d8c123029,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/22/arts/22bam-item/22bam-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=05d1301f7ba5d2d6dd57ffdead5d7bc4d8cfc76edb95e0f4a0a35097120cda91&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Philip Glass's 1980 opera ""Satyagraha,"" which will be staged at the Brooklyn Academy of Music this fall by the Folkoperan and Cirkus Cirkor of Sweden as part of the Next Wave Festival.",cf76093e-b973-57fa-a82f-3b5d8c123029,N24News/imgs/cf76093e-b973-57fa-a82f-3b5d8c123029.jpg,12
Health,A Quiet Revolution in the Treatment of Childhood Diarrhea,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/11/health/catching-up-with-a-childhood-killer-diarrhea.html,"Far from the world's fears about Ebola and MERS, a quiet revolution is taking place in the diagnosis of a disease much more prosaic but far more threatening: childhood diarrhea. After pneumonia, diarrhea is the deadliest threat to infants worldwide, killing about 700,000 every year. More than 40 pathogens -- viruses, bacteria and parasites -- cause diarrhea in children in developing countries. According to decades-old guidelines from the World Health Organization, these children should receive oral rehydration; intravenous rehydration if they cannot keep fluids down; and a zinc supplement. The guidelines also say that children should receive antibiotics only when there is blood in their stool. At the time the recommendations were written, the best science indicated that blood was a sign of bacterial infection, and bacterial diarrhea is usually the most dangerous. But bacterial causes are more common than had been realized, recent studies have found, and blood is not always present. And because many children with diarrhea do not receive antibiotics under W.H.O. guidelines, some experts say, many die or end up stunted by persistent infections that could have been cured.

First drafted more than 30 years ago, the guidelines ""were developed based on what everybody thought at the time -- that most diarrhea was viral, and if it was bacterial, it would probably have blood in it,"" said Dr. Jeffrey M. Pernica, a pediatrician at McMaster University Medical School in Canada. With the advent of improved diagnostic technology, he added, ""Now we can tell who's really got what."" A major study into causes of childhood diarrhea, the Global Enteric Multicenter Study published in 2013, found the top five to be rotavirus, the Cryptosporidium parasite, two different strains of E. coli bacteria, and Shigella bacteria. In various countries, other bacteria -- including Aeromonas, Campylobacter and Vibrio cholerae, the cause of cholera -- were also important. ""Actually, blood is a very poor marker"" of bacterial diarrhea, said Dr. David M. Goldfarb, a microbiologist at the University of British Columbia who led a recent study of children's diarrhea in Botswana and advocates changing the guidelines. ""And it does not predict death.""

In diarrhea, time is crucial. Infants often arrive at hospitals close to death from dehydration, so quick decisions must be made. When the cause is viral, doctors can only hope the immune system kills the virus. Various bacterial infections are treated with various antibiotics. Parasites must be killed with other drugs. Accurate diagnosis once took days. Stool samples were frozen and shipped to labs for microscopic evaluation or antibody tests. Clinics in poor countries, unable to do all that, used the simple W.H.O. guidelines. But the price for not providing antibiotics when they are needed can be high. Repeated bouts of diarrhea flush nutrients out of the intestines and leave victims physically and intellectually stunted. Children who are chronically malnourished before age 2 grow up to do worse in school, are shorter than normal, and as adults give birth to smaller infants. Tarik Jasarevic, a spokesman for the W.H.O., responded that new studies were ""important, but not enough to change guidelines."" Using antibiotics too liberally could encourage the emergence of local strains of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, Mr. Jasarevic said. Some experts object to that reasoning, arguing that wealthy tourists at little risk of death routinely take antibiotics for diarrhea picked up in the same places. ""It's not that the guidelines are bad, they're just old,"" said Dr. Anita Zaidi, the director for diarrheal diseases at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which has paid for much of the newest research.

Dr. Zaidi, a pediatrician who has worked in some of Pakistan's poorest neighborhoods, says that she does not believe that fears of creating resistance justify withholding antibiotics. ""When travelers get them, how can we not give them to children under 2 at risk of death?"" she said. ""It's a matter of equity."" An unexpected and scary finding of the Global Enteric Multicenter Study was that children hospitalized until they were ""cured"" by standard treatment were eight times as likely to die during a two-month follow-up period as healthy children who were never hospitalized. That suggests that standard treatment is deeply flawed, but it is not clear how. Dr. Zaidi said she had three theories: that children with diarrhea had other pathogens that were never detected, that diarrhea had so inflamed their intestines that the children could not absorb food, or that they were so weakened by surviving one infection that a second killed them. Dr. Magnus Lindh, a diarrhea specialist at the University of Gothenburg in Sweden, who led a smaller study in Rwanda, said many children had several gut pathogens simultaneously and it was hard to know which caused their diarrhea. The best way to guess, he said, was to count how many times a machine used to detect genes by polymerase chain reaction, or P.C.R., had to double a sample's DNA to get a positive reading. A low ""cycle count"" implies a lot of pathogen. Using P.C.R. technology to make accurate diagnoses on the spot would save lives, as it has in tuberculosis. ""It's a lot more idiot-proof,"" Dr. Pernica said.

But P.C.R. machines are expensive. Full-size machines can cost $30,000 or more, and $50 per test. Small specialized versions exist, like the GeneXpert, which has revolutionized the diagnosis of tuberculosis in developing countries. But a small P.C.R. machine intended just for diarrhea has not been produced. In the meantime, Canadian researchers have developed ""flocked swabs"" resembling tiny nylon bottle brushes with stoppers on their stems to make sure they cannot be inserted too far into the rectum. They pick up enough DNA to test, obviating the need to wait for a messy stool sample. But the swab still requires P.C.R. testing. Some experts question whether P.C.R. diagnosis will ever be cost-effective. It is worth the expense to accurately diagnose tuberculosis, which requires a six-month drug regimen, said Dr. Eric R. Houpt, a diagnostics expert at the University of Virginia Medical School. But diarrhea now costs about 50 cents to treat, and adding an antibiotic costs only about 50 cents more. ""To be cost-effective, you'd need a test that cost only 30 or 40 cents,"" Dr. Zaidi said. Instead of spending many millions of dollars to develop and distribute P.C.R. machines for on-the-spot diagnosis of diarrhea, Dr. Zaidi and others argue it would make more sense to just revise the W.H.O. guidelines to treat children more aggressively. ""You might just get by always giving a very sick child whatever antibiotic you know works in that general area,"" Dr. Zaidi said. The guidelines may yet be changed, depending on what further research finds, Mr. Jasarevic said. The W.H.O. is collaborating with the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation on a major study to see which children would benefit from taking antibiotics even when doctors do not know what is making them ill.",An effort is afoot to update outdated standards for treating childhood diarrhea.,633d462b-bc43-51e5-b5bb-b4fdb63112de,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/08/11/science/11DIARRHEAJP/11DIARRHEAJP-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=97c912c805ac9e02575a39338d7ba4e2ddb34760723522d7b99f80f6158f9e0b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Abshira Abdukadir, a four-year-old girl in Somalia, being treated for diarrhea, which kills 700,000 infants each year.",633d462b-bc43-51e5-b5bb-b4fdb63112de,N24News/imgs/633d462b-bc43-51e5-b5bb-b4fdb63112de.jpg,1
Dance,My Surprising Duet With Arthur Mitchell in Cold War Moscow,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/25/arts/dance/allegra-kent-arthur-mitchell-ballet.html,"One of my most vivid memories of Arthur Mitchell, who died last week, is of dancing with him in Moscow in 1962. George Balanchine, New York City Ballet's founding choreographer, had left the Soviet Union in the 1920s. And now he was returning for the first time to present his company of American dancers. Tensions were high between our countries. We were deep in the Cold War, just a week before the Cuban Missile Crisis. On opening night, the Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, was in the audience, and so were top party members. Arthur and I were dancing in Balanchine's ""Agon,"" with music by Igor Stravinsky, the last ballet on the program. Balanchine was nervous. The cast was nervous. But not Arthur. (Arthur was never nervous.) In the wings before our pas de deux, he could see I was jumping out of my skin. He said, ""This is just a small town, Allegra."" What he said was so ludicrous that it calmed me down. The reason for everybody's nerves? ""Agon,"" created in 1957, had changed the course of choreography. It has form, but not conventional form, and strange innovations that had come out of Balanchine's different way of hearing music and creating movement. Stravinsky's music is rhythmically complex and difficult even for the dancers to count. (A conductor was sent ahead to rehearse the orchestra.) And ""Agon"" is a non-narrative ballet, costumed only in leotards and tights -- not classical tutus and princely tunics. It was unlike anything that the Russian audience, so passionate about ballet, had seen before.

The most unusual part of ""Agon"" is the pas de deux, originally choreographed for Arthur and Diana Adams, a black man and a white woman; the man doesn't just support the woman, he dances with her -- they're in concert. This racial mix was startling and different for American audiences at the time. And now we wondered how the Russian audience would react. Arthur told me we should wait in the wings for two counts before our entrance. He wanted the audience members to see an empty stage, so they could breathe, and perhaps wonder what would happen next. I don't remember him ever saying this to me before, in the many times we'd performed this pas de deux. But Arthur had an uncanny sense of stagecraft, more heightened in this crucial time and place. We made our entrance and waited for the signal from the conductor. Then we tore across the stage in a long diagonal of dynamic lunges and turns, before settling into an odd design of calmness. Different hand patterns. My leg hooked around his shoulder. A series of ""arrivings"" somewhere, then unexpected momentary resolutions. Painterly patterns woven into the choreography. His white T-shirt and my black leotard. Dark skin tones and light skin tones. After that came a moment when Arthur held my hand and led me around in a semicircle, before the next surprise in Balanchine's choreography. Arthur had told me earlier what Mr. B had told him as he choreographed the piece: This move was like a trainer leading an elegant racehorse to its stall. He didn't need to tell me this, but he chose to, because he wanted the pas de deux to be all it could be. He was a generous partner, and that gave me confidence. Not all partners were like that.

Our ""Agon"" pas de deux was sensual. Sculptural shapes would evolve in unpredictable ways, ending with a surprising beauty. It was like a puzzle (but not exactly). Arthur placed my pointed foot on the floor and indicated that my other my leg should go up -- and then he was on the floor, supporting me with only his extended arm and hand: Was he leading me, or I leading him? We arrived together at the next configuration. After our duet, the audience went wild. At the stage door when we walked out, people said our names -- screamed our names (MEE-chell! Kent!) -- and later they would have flowers for us. Arthur became one of their favorite performers. At that moment, Arthur Mitchell was the only black principal dancer in the company -- he was there not because of his race but because of his excellence. Balanchine was a visionary. When he first saw Arthur in 1955 and invited him into the company, he saw not an African-American dancer, but a dancer who could thrill an audience. Balanchine wanted dancers who could project something beyond technique. Your eyes were drawn to Arthur onstage. You had to watch him. Even if you knew the choreography, you didn't know what was going to happen. Arthur was a star. I sometimes danced with Arthur in Balanchine's ""Ivesiana"" (1954), with music by Charles Ives, in the section called ""In the Inn."" After a romp full of jazzy Balanchine inventions, the two dancers shake hands, then part, leaving the stage in different directions. That at first seems casual, but the music has a subtle change. It becomes wistful. We somehow know and feel that these two will never see each other again. When I heard the news of Arthur's death, I thought back to ""In the Inn."" Arthur was an amazing person. And I had the great honor of dancing with him.","The ballerina Allegra Kent remembers dancing ""Agon"" with Mr. Mitchell on opening night of New York City Ballet's 1962 tour of the Soviet Union.",fbf3b915-c0a3-5095-865c-10d9672461c1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/26/arts/26arthurbyallegra/26arthurbyallegra-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=aecc11ea8c270b8c753da4b145fc815458779619c75937cdf05118e5427a1717&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Arthur Mitchell and Allegra Kent of New York City Ballet performing George Balanchine&rsquo;s &ldquo;Agon&rdquo; in 1962.,fbf3b915-c0a3-5095-865c-10d9672461c1,N24News/imgs/fbf3b915-c0a3-5095-865c-10d9672461c1.jpg,6

Technology,Uber and Lyft Consider Franchise-Like Model in California,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/18/technology/uber-lyft-franchise-california.html,"OAKLAND, Calif. -- Uber and Lyft, which are facing mounting pressure to classify their freelance drivers as employees in California, are looking for another way. One option that both companies are seriously discussing is licensing their brands to operators of vehicle fleets in California, according to three people with knowledge of the plans. The change would resemble an independently operated franchise, allowing Uber and Lyft to keep an arms-length association with drivers so that the companies would not need to employ them and pay their benefits. The idea would effectively be a return to the days of how groups of black cars were run. Lyft has presented the plan to its board of directors, one person said. Uber, which already works with fleet operators in Germany and Spain, is also familiar with the business model. The companies have not committed to the franchise-like plans, said the people with knowledge of the discussions, who asked to remain anonymous because the details are confidential. Uber and Lyft are waiting to see how California's legal situation around drivers, who have been treated as independent contractors, plays out first, they said.

Matt Kallman, an Uber spokesman, said the work on establishing fleets was ""exploratory"" and that the company was ""not sure whether a fleet model would ultimately be viable in California."" A Lyft spokeswoman, Julie Wood, said the company had looked at alternative models but favored an approach where drivers ""remain independent and can work whenever they want while also receiving additional health care benefits and an earnings guarantee."" The ride-hailing giants are considering how to retool their businesses as they grapple with a new California law, Assembly Bill 5, which could upend their services. The law, which was designed to grant employment benefits to gig workers, could force Uber and Lyft to categorize drivers as employees if it was shown that the drivers' jobs were part of the companies' core business, among other criteria. Although the law went into effect in January, Uber and Lyft have not complied with it, arguing that they are simply tech platforms and are not transportation businesses. In May, California sued Uber and Lyft to enforce the new law.

Their clash with the state is set to come to a head this week. This month, a San Francisco Superior Court judge ordered the companies to employ their drivers by Thursday. Executives at Uber and Lyft, who have argued that they cannot meet that deadline, have appealed the decision and warned that they would be forced to shut down their services as soon as Friday if the order was not reversed.

""If our efforts here are not successful, it would force us to suspend operations in California,"" John Zimmer, Lyft's president, said in an earnings call last week. California accounts for about 16 percent of Lyft's business, he said. Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber's chief executive, also said last week in an MSNBC interview that the company's ride-hailing services in California would stop, at least temporarily, if the order was not changed. ""It's a fork-in-the-road situation,"" said Dan Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities who tracks the ride-hailing industry. ""These are some of the tough decisions they need to make to save their business model."" Uber and Lyft, which are based in San Francisco, have long considered their drivers to be contractors. That means that drivers are responsible for their own vehicle and maintenance costs and that Uber and Lyft do not pay for overtime, unemployment insurance or other expenses. The companies have argued that this freelance model allows drivers to drive only when they want to. But critics have said it places unreasonable financial burdens on drivers and gives Uber and Lyft unfair advantages over businesses that follow employment laws. Uber and Lyft have strenuously objected to A.B. 5 and have been fighting its reach. The companies have poured tens of millions of dollars into a ballot measure that would exempt them from the state law. Uber has also made changes to its product, such as showing fares to drivers upfront and allowing them to decline rides without facing penalties, to reinforce their status as independent contractors.

But behind the scenes, officials at Uber and Lyft also began discussing just-in-case options for their California businesses last year, the people with knowledge of the plans said. At Uber, many of the proposed ideas were code-named with the names of characters from the Mario Bros. video game, like Luigi, the people said. The Washington Post reported earlier on Project Luigi, which included the changes to Uber's app that give drivers more control over fares.

Another option that policy teams at both of the companies floated was the franchise-like model, the people with knowledge of the plans said. Under the proposal, Uber and Lyft would invite other businesses to establish ride-hailing fleets using their platforms. That could bolster the companies' claims that they were simply tech companies that built sophisticated dispatch services and that providing transportation was outside their core business, protecting them from A.B. 5's requirements. At Uber, the effort drew inspiration from the company's operations in Germany and Spain, where transportation rules have already forced it to work with fleets, Mr. Kallman said. Lyft based its plan on FedEx, which franchises some of its delivery routes to local operators, current and former employees said.","Under pressure to classify their freelance drivers as employees, the ride-hailing companies are discussing another option.",edacd496-a404-5db7-894a-c0a75f922521,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/18/business/18ridefranchise1/18ridefranchise1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a64ca8b0f2e02712b1cd3117aa4cc37b879593b765601007f6cc95ac15e21abe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Uber and Lyft have separately discussed plans to license their technology to those who want to operate fleets of ride-hailing cars in California.,edacd496-a404-5db7-894a-c0a75f922521,N24News/imgs/edacd496-a404-5db7-894a-c0a75f922521.jpg,20
Dance,"Watch These Captivating Salsa Dancers, and Try Not to Break a Sweat",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/14/arts/dance/new-york-salsa-dancing-photos.html,"Watch These Captivating Salsa Dancers, and Try Not to Break a Sweat

Hidden from the world four floors below, a sweaty sea of partygoers -- all twisting, turning and swiveling -- transform the Dancesport ballroom studio into one of the city's largest salsa parties. Walk along 34th Street on a Sunday evening and you may catch a hint of the dueling trumpets and insistent rhythms swirling in the air. This is Las Chicas Locas (the Crazy Girls), a weekly salsa party that takes over the ballroom late each Sunday afternoon -- and doesn't end until early Monday morning, when most New Yorkers are fast asleep. Around 300 to 400 dancers descend on the darkened space -- set aglow by a mix of multicolored and Christmas lights -- for the party that inherited its name from a now-shuttered restaurant in Chelsea where it began. There are also smaller classrooms for other Latin and African dances (like bachata and kizomba), but most of the party stays out front, where the room's temperature rises as the bodies multiply.

New York-style salsa, in which couples start their count on the two, is mostly what you'll see on the dance floor at Las Chicas Locas. (Some dancers visiting from other cities may sneak in on the one count, and occasionally the music switches up for a bachata break.)

Ms. Burns explained that the sense of controlled movements in New York-style salsa sets it apart from other types. ""It doesn't spread out,"" she said. ""It's linear, super tight, a little faster."" She added, ""Each dancer has their own styles and shines -- that's when you break away from your partner and mess around with the rhythm on your own. You get to play with them for a second before they pick you back up."" ""I know so many people by their hands, bodies or physicality, but I can't tell you their name,"" she said.

The D.J. will keep playing as long as dancers are twirling. But around 11 p.m., the D.J. stops the music and tells everyone to clear the floor. The dancers are now audience members; cheering, screaming and whistling as professionals or students emerge from backstage for their performances.

The performers vary each week, and performances range in styles and levels. Some dancers are champions showing off award-winning routines, but most of them come in from local dance schools in the five boroughs and surrounding states. All of them are greeted enthusiastically by the crowd. ""There's a very liberating feeling you get when dancing salsa,"" Meagan Larkin, 33, said. As someone who wasn't raised with Latin dance in their home, it was really exciting to embrace it and learn how to feel confident with the movement.""

""Salsa is really freeing for your soul,"" Talia Berger said. ""I become my true self with it."" Weekend after weekend, Xiomaris Cotto Rios, who works with the party's organizer, Alejandro Bouza, remains one of the friendly faces at Las Chicas Locas. ""It's very different from what I do at my regular day job,"" she said, referring to her work as a scientific researcher. ""Sometimes you need your brain to reset. For me, this is my refresh.""","Watch these dancers, and join one of New York City's biggest salsa parties.",33deb8e1-7e33-5915-9998-875b44c3bebf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/15/arts/15SALSA-OAK6/15SALSA-OAK6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=add9b8bd21a6962fe30595bcab0ea64f9b02f3addceaecc42ec222afd605c443&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Julia Tucker and Chad Plummer, above and at left.",33deb8e1-7e33-5915-9998-875b44c3bebf,N24News/imgs/33deb8e1-7e33-5915-9998-875b44c3bebf.jpg,6

Theater,Mike Birbiglia Sounds Off on Cellphones in His Theater,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/theater/mike-birbiglia-cellphone-disruption-broadway.html,"Mike Birbiglia has been unafraid to deal with interruptions to ""The New One,"" his solo show on Broadway.

Mike Birbiglia was just a few minutes into his one-man Broadway show the other night when he spotted the woman in the front row, pecking away at her cellphone. He stopped his storytelling, walked toward her seat and addressed her from the stage. ""A little housekeeping here: Maybe don't text,"" he said, before pointing out the obvious: He could see her, and her phone. Midway through the show, he saw a patron pointing a camera at him from the mezzanine. ""I can see you videotaping,"" he said. Then, ruefully, he mused that in the future, theater might just consist of actors on a stage, staring at a sea of screens. ""The New One,"" Mr. Birbiglia's well-reviewed comedy about fatherhood, has been running only since Oct. 25, but already he's had several run-ins with cellphone users, whose devices have at times gone off during intensely personal moments of revelation. His show is not alone: The sound of a ringtone or the sight of a glowing screen is a regular occurrence on Broadway, as in every other corner of the culture. But Mr. Birbiglia, because he is playing a version of himself and engages with the audience, is able to respond directly, and he does. In an interview on Tuesday, he talked about how he is managing the interruptions; he also provided audio clips of several interactions. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.

How often have you had to call someone out for using their cellphone during a show? It's weird -- it's happened four out of the last five shows. People think I like it because I have jokes for it, but it's literally just years of battle armor -- road calluses built up from dealing with inappropriate audience behavior.

How do you figure out what to say? I talked to Steve Martin about this once -- he's obviously a genius at dealing with audiences -- and he says the best way to respond to something happening in the audience is honestly, which is what I try to do. I basically try to bring people into my head as it's happening, which is to say: ""O.K. guys, we all know this inappropriate thing has happened. We're all witness to it. We're not going to skewer the person because that's not in the spirit of theater, or kindness, but we're going to acknowledge it so that it doesn't ruin the shared experience we're all attempting to achieve together."" And then you've got to get the story back on track.

There is some school of thought that you should be furious or indignant or tell the person to screw off, but I don't think that that's quite right for a few reasons. One, it's probably an honest mistake -- there's 1,000 people in the room, and there's bound to be someone who had a lot going on in their day and it just escapes them and their head is jumbled or whatever and so to scream at somebody in a situation like that doesn't feel quite right. And with my show, the calibration of whether the audience likes me or doesn't like me is very delicate -- my character does things wrong and does things that are questionable and does things that the audience might not agree with -- so if I went nuts and said ""You are a disgusting menace,"" people would be like, ""You know, I don't think I like him too much.""

How does the audience react when you call someone out? The audience loves it. It's a selfish thing to let your phone go. And so when someone calls that out, and says, ""Hey, maybe this isn't the best time,"" it's fun for the audience.",Four times recently he's stopped his solo Broadway show to make his feelings known — gently but firmly.

Dance,"Review: 'Actual Size Plus,' Sally Silvers's Hitchcock-Inspired Work",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/24/arts/dance/review-actual-size-plus-sally-silverss-hitchcock-inspired-work.html,"On Friday night at the 92nd Street Y, the choreographer Sally Silvers pulled back the curtain -- "" 'Wizard of Oz' style,"" as she put it -- to show how Alfred Hitchcock helped her make a dance.

In the talking-demonstration portion of the program, part of the Harkness Dance Festival, which wrapped up over the weekend, she revealed the framework for ""Actual Size Plus,"" composed of 25 sections inspired by scenes from the films ""The Birds"" and ""North by Northwest."" The festival's Stripped/Dressed format requires choreographers to divulge something about their working process in the first half followed by a complete performance in the second. Ms. Silvers did more -- she began choreographing a new section.

To see a snippet from ""The Birds"" followed by the corresponding dance sequence was a fun trip through Ms. Silvers's imagination: how she translates spatial design into movement, structure into choreography and specific motifs -- like Hitchcock's stylized use of the hands -- into a jagged puzzle of scenes. They rub against one another, heightening romance, anxiety, uncertainty.

With an agile sense of the absurd, Ms. Silvers explores tension with a cast that includes Alicia Ohs, Carolyn Hall and Luke Miller. But it's the lead couple who lend the dance its grandeur: The joke is that Dylan Crossman, suave and persuasive, and Melissa Toogood, superlative as ever while evoking the cool sensibility of a Hitchcock blonde, are anything but actual size. Onstage, they are larger than life.","Scenes from ""The Birds"" and ""North by Northwest"" played out onstage in Ms. Silvers's piece for the Harkness Dance Festival.",d41579d7-385c-5de9-a367-590b689800ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/03/24/arts/23HARKNESSWEB/23HARKNESSWEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=7986e3e1e299a9a835bd4e976a28314e1e62972ee6a9eca57a0a89ec0b9b7e66&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Melissa Toogood and Dylan Crossman perform ""Actual Size Plus.""",d41579d7-385c-5de9-a367-590b689800ab,N24News/imgs/d41579d7-385c-5de9-a367-590b689800ab.jpg,6
Real Estate,Hopes for a Street Resistant to Rebirth,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/realestate/commercial/hopes-of-a-renaissance-on-a-greenwich-village-street.html,"For decades, it's been a retail version of a hard-to-crack whodunit: What is wrong with West Eighth Street? As Greenwich Village became one of the most desirable addresses for businesses in Manhattan, why did West Eighth Street, especially the block between Fifth Avenue and Avenue of the Americas, lag and even deteriorate? For a long time, one storefront after another featured shoes, and the block drew many customers. But more recently, the rows of shoe stores steadily closed their doors, giving the street a rough-and-tumble look. And despite attempts by local officials to engineer a turnaround, most new businesses that tried to move into the empty storefronts never really got off the ground.

Now a spate of recent leases by more than a dozen food-related businesses, as well as the opening of a much-anticipated boutique hotel, is spurring landlords, restaurateurs and real estate brokers to suggest another Eighth Street revival. ""Does it have a real shot this time? It sure does,"" said Robert Futterman, a retail broker who isn't affiliated with any of the block's stores or buildings. ""The street could finally get a hip, cool factor, which would help it."" What's fueling the most hope for Mr. Futterman and others is the new hotel, the 107-room Marlton, which opened last month in a cream-brick landmark at No. 5. Co-owned by Sean MacPherson, whose Bowery hotel is often credited with ushering in the redevelopment of that once-seedy street, the Marlton features a lobby lined with rugs and stacked with books, where the public is invited to work on laptops. A restaurant and bar space tentatively called Cafe Marlton is to open this month in the building, which dates to 1900. ""I like the idea of creating a neighborhood place in New York where you can hang out without feeling strong-armed into spending money,"" Mr. MacPherson said on a recent tour.

A popular crash pad for Beat Generation writers like Jack Kerouac, who according to some historical accounts, wrote part of ""Desolation Angels"" in a room there, the Marlton in later years served as a dorm for the nearby New School, during which time it grew shabby. After a two-year, $15 million gut renovation, the snug rooms feature crown moldings, mahogany closets and wall-mounted light fixtures styled like human hands. Prices start at $225 a night at the hotel, which is being leased for at least 50 years by Mr. MacPherson and BD Hotels, his partner, from the Seril family, which owned the Upper West Side's Belnord apartment tower. ""You are surrounded by one of the most dynamic neighborhoods around, artistically and culturally, and here you have a street with discount shoe stores,"" said Richard Born, a BD principal, who graduated from New York University around the corner. In fact, one of those stores, Kinway, was located in a part of the lobby until recently. ""I couldn't dream of a better place to put a hotel,"" he added. When they venture out, guests don't have to walk far for entertainment. In the last two years, at least a dozen restaurants have opened on the block or plan to do so soon, among about 70 storefronts. Offering hamburgers, sushi and even gourmet popcorn, these new businesses join a handful of established wine bars and barbecue joints. They can seem snazzier than many that came before. Another example is Greenwich Project, which sells $45 rib-eye steaks in a two-level space at No. 47, whose colorful art recalls the comic books once sold on the property.

But the vendor really generating buzz is Stumptown Coffee Roasters, which opened at No. 30, in a corner location at Macdougal Street, in May. The Oregon-based company has a fervent following, and its customers can choose the gadget with which their coffee is brewed. Stumptown's only other New York outpost is at the Ace Hotel on West 29th Street and Broadway. That Midtown spot, along with the Ace Hotel in which it is located, has helped elevate the stature of its NoMad neighborhood, landlords and brokers say. ""Stumptown and the Marlton will be the anchors to solidify the development of the corridor,"" said William Abramson, the director of sales and leasing for Buchbinder & Warren Realty Group, which represents the owners of about a dozen buildings on the block, including Stumptown's. Of the 14 retail berths in those buildings, two are empty, with asking rents steady for now at about $125 a square foot, Mr. Abramson said. That stagnation in prices may work in the block's favor. Storefronts lease at a discount to nearby University Place, where rents average $250 a square foot, and to Broadway near Houston Street, where they average $350, according to Mr. Futterman. Foot traffic on West Eighth, he pointed out, is high because it acts as a link between the East and West Villages. Over all, there continue to be several noticeable gaps on the street, including a string of darkened windows on the southern side. Yet the vacancy rate has dropped significantly in the last couple years, according to the Village Alliance, the local business improvement district.

It now hovers at 8 percent, down from a recession high of 12 percent but on a par with the vacancy rate from before the boom years, when sneaker and sandal shops could seem monolithic. Though there may be no single explanation for why the block has struggled relative to its peers, earlier theories were that its sidewalks were too narrow. In the early 2000s, they were widened by a few feet. Others say that the storefronts on the block, which is lined with skinny 19th-century row houses and is in a historic district, are too small for modern retail tastes. They typically range from 700 square feet down to just 100 square feet, which is the size of one business that sells the kind of water pipes used for marijuana. Mr. Abramson said he had to cobble together three adjacent storefronts to lure Stumptown, which also entailed canceling the lease of an existing clothing store. He has also vowed not to rent space to tattoo parlors and pipe shops, to ensure a more upscale tone, he said. Other incentives are planned. The Village Alliance is talking with the city's Department of Transportation about possibly putting in the kind of pedestrian plazas found in Times Square and others parts of the city, said William Kelley, the group's executive director. But not everybody is convinced that it is smart to rely solely on restaurants to improve the block. A healthy block needs a variety of retail, Mr. Futterman said, and often, some brand-name national firms selling accessories, cosmetics or clothing, like the kind that have colonized sections of nearby Bleecker Street. ""Otherwise, it runs the risk of turning into a food court,"" he said. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, the area's attempt at a whole-cloth makeover has generated raw feelings among some owners of the surviving shoe stores, like Moshe Mansoor, who owns DaVinci, at No. 37.",The arrival of a boutique hotel and a popular coffee roaster on West Eighth Street could signal a turnaround on a struggling corridor.,700eef8f-f970-5fa0-9246-174359c9719a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/10/02/business/EIGHTHST-2/EIGHTHST-2-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=399&w=600&s=8db47624471fde06621fad416c0d9f1c98b181f0004496b88f424f1f69c3c6b9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"New shops are opening on West Eighth Street, a street once known for its shoe stores.",700eef8f-f970-5fa0-9246-174359c9719a,N24News/imgs/700eef8f-f970-5fa0-9246-174359c9719a.jpg,7

Movies,"'Diane' Review: A Vibrant Tale of Love, Sisterhood and Decline",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/28/movies/diane-review.html,"Past indiscretions haunt Diane, and this movie, and the glory of Place's performance -- and that of her co-stars -- is how barely these need to be verbalized. Emotions play across faces weathered by age and bonded by long experience, and the wonder is that a story this threaded with sickness and decline is neither tedious nor depressing. Each scene has its own specific energy and tone, conjured by a happy congruence of skillfully vivid acting, naturalistic conversations and a cinematographer, Wyatt Garfield, with a clear grasp of mood. Whether lingering on the candlelit faces of diners during a blackout, or watching calmly as Diane dances, drunkenly, alone in a bar, his camera feels completely in tune with his director's intent.

Filled with wintry roads and sensible clothing, ""Diane"" plays out at bedsides and in kitchens where women cheer one another with stories and memories. This is Jones's first narrative film, and he explains in the press notes that his aim was to make a picture about his great-aunts, a feisty, close-knit group who dominated family gatherings. It makes sense, then, that Brian is the only male character who really registers: other men mostly come and go in the background.

In the context of the modern multiplex, ""Diane"" amounts to an act of cinematic bravery, not just in its choice of tough-sell material, but in the patience with which Jones tends it. Parts of his story don't quite work (especially Brian's extreme spiritual awakening); but by examining a life from the angle of its final destination, the movie offers a rich and tender study of a woman hollowed out by remorse. For Diane, the past, far from being a foreign country, is where she has lived for a very long time.","Mary Kay Place is astonishing as a weary widow dealing with guilt, heartache and a diminishing circle of friends.",78e546cb-e9a4-5378-b5d4-87f66d2ab796,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/29/arts/29diane1/diane1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=66f29c069f759489aafdc8f45e3d62578cfd6a6830e776ad1dd7454dc7ca14a9&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mary Kay Place in &ldquo;Diane,&rdquo; written and directed by Kent Jones.",78e546cb-e9a4-5378-b5d4-87f66d2ab796,N24News/imgs/78e546cb-e9a4-5378-b5d4-87f66d2ab796.jpg,5
Style,A Clubby French Bistro Ruffles Uptown Social Feathers,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/21/style/la-goulue-restaurant-upper-east-side.html,"When La Goulue, the clubby French restaurant favored by Upper East Side socialites and others in the Black Card set, reopened in January after an eight-year absence, a certain rush was to be expected. Some spoke of its reincarnation in near-messianic terms. ""We have been waiting forever for La Goulue to come back,"" said Francine LeFrak, a Broadway producer and daughter of Samuel LeFrak, the real estate developer who died in 2003. ""There is so much loyalty toward that place."" John Demsey, an executive president at Estee Lauder, said he had been to the restaurant every week since it reopened. ""The thing that's superfun and surrealistic is that everyone you knew from 25 years ago is still in the room, sometimes with different spouses or partners,"" he said. ""For some people, time has stood still, depending on the quality of their dermatologists or plastic surgeons."" But its return is also testing loyalties and disrupting the finely calibrated social pecking order of the ZIP code's wood-paneled canteens.

When it closed in 2009 because the landlord would not renew its lease, it left a social void that other French restaurants were happy to fill. Chief among them was Le Bilboquet, a cozy bistro that moved to a larger spot at 20 East 60th Street in 2013; its owners include Philippe Delgrange, Ronald Perelman, Eric Clapton and Steven Witkoff. Le Bilboquet's buzzy scene of 1 percenters was soon peppered with boldfaces including Bill Gates, Martha Stewart, Bill Clinton, Steven Tisch, Hugh Jackman, Leonardo DiCaprio, Steven Spielberg and Catherine Zeta-Jones. The night Charlie Rose was dismissed from PBS last November for alleged sexual misconduct, he still arrived at his table in the front room. Now with La Goulue reopening just one block north, at 29 East 61st Street, longtime patrons feel like remarried wives whose first husbands came back from the dead. Even the most socially prominent are treading carefully, fearful of offending one restaurateur or another, and jeopardizing their standing.

Julie Macklowe, a beauty entrepreneur who is married to the real estate scion Billy Macklowe, made a bold move by holding her 40th birthday party at La Goulue in December, a month before the restaurant officially reopened. Guests included the financier John Paulson, the real estate executive Aby Rosen and the art dealer David Mugrabi. ""I'm afraid when Philippe finds out, I might lose my table at Bilboquet,"" Ms. Macklowe said, referring to the charismatic Mr. Delgrange, who is Le Bilboquet's most public owner. Her birthday guests are similarly worried about ruffling feathers. ""Yes, I was at Julie's party, but there is no need for Philippe to know,"" said Brian Levine, a fertility doctor who was at Le Bilboquet on a recent Tuesday night, ordering the Cajun chicken.

Where one was seated was also a reflection of social standing. ""Prestige and brand awareness are on the top of this crowd's list, so if you are seated in the back, forget it,"" said R. Couri Hay, a publicist for society doyennes, charitable institutions and luxury brands. Mindful of the heightened competition (the immediate area also includes JoJo and Rotisserie Georgette), Mr. Denoyer was careful not to alter his prototype. The original signage is back, along with the dark wood paneling that he kept in storage when his former lease ran out. Even the phone number (212-988-8169) is the same as it was in 1974.

But Mr. Denoyer isn't resting on nostalgia alone. He and others from La Goulue have been reaching out to preferred patrons and enticing customers with more generous portions and lower wine prices. ""I felt very courted by La Goulue when they told me I can have a table for 11 on a coveted Saturday if I choose to have my annual birthday party there this year,"" said Mr. Norden, the real estate agent. ""Clients are also impressed that I can get a reservation at one of these social French spots. They feel I am an insider, and it helps me seal a deal."" La Goulue has also been accused of poaching employees from rivals. One sore point is the dapper and blue-eyed Craig Pogson. Before he joined La Goulue as its managing partner, he was a manager at Le Bilboquet for two years, attending to V.I.P.s and overseeing the wine program. ""We went through excruciating measures and hired an expensive attorney to get Craig his green card, so that he could remain in the country and work for us,"" said Karine Bakhoum, a spokeswoman for Le Bilboquet. Mr. Pogson, who is from Scotland, said he more than satisfied his end of the arrangement. ""They did get me my visa, but I got my own green card and I brought in 20 percent of their best customers, so they got a very good return on their investment with me,"" he said. ""They paid me pennies, and I helped make them rich.""

Adding to the contretemps, Mr. Pogson has hired former co-workers including Alex Lerner, the aristocratic-looking woman who ran the door at Le Bilboquet's Hamptons outpost this summer, often turning potential diners away. Mr. Pogson says that the people he hired came to him for jobs. ""They tried to hire my lunch maitre d' too,"" said Mr. Delgrange, of Le Bilboquet, before getting in a dig of his own. ""I was afraid once they opened I would be dead here, but we are still packed. Our crowd is much younger, though Craig left with a list of their phone numbers. And I'm sure he will contact them.""

And, for the time being, it may be easier to get a table -- at least for those with the right social connections. Cindy Barshop, who owns the women's spa V Spot, which specializes in vaginal treatments, and who has appeared on ""The Real Housewives of New York City,"" visited La Goulue for dinner in January. ""I was with three major superwealthy investors, but when we got there, the doorman asked if we had a reservation,"" she said. ""When we said no, he wouldn't even let us step inside."" ""So I said, 'No problem, we do have a reservation at Bilboquet,'"" she continued. ""Instantly he told us to hold on a minute. Then he walked inside, came back and showed us to a table.""","The return of La Goulue, a beloved French restaurant, has disrupted the gilded social scene and is testing the loyalties of A-list patrons.",66c108d3-476d-5424-af0d-e38ea8281a49,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/22/fashion/22goulue9/22goulue9-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=0ce4b51e23937724f267cfa66a25806ecf7bc2b1a8d4082bb03ec84b53432a25&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"La Goulue, a clubby French restaurant popular with Upper East Side socialites, reopened in January.",66c108d3-476d-5424-af0d-e38ea8281a49,N24News/imgs/66c108d3-476d-5424-af0d-e38ea8281a49.jpg,15
Movies,'Dragged Across Concrete' Review: The Evil That Men Do (Repeatedly),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/movies/dragged-across-concrete-review.html,"The story is as predictable as expected, with the usual guns, cars and money, though drawn out to an unhurried 158 minutes. There are ostensible good men turned bad, and one who is perhaps less bad. There are women (Jennifer Carpenter makes sympathetic a disposable character), a retinue of the negligible, the victimized, the soon to be dead. Most of the characters fit into three categories -- evil men, men who stand in evil's way and collateral damage -- and some from each will be sacrificed on the hard-boiled altar. This includes a baby, whose sole function is to fool you into thinking that things won't turn really ugly. They do, which makes optimistic viewers suckers.

Zahler likes to pull back to show you people in their environments, in vaulted and confining spaces. He plays around with light and dark, but mostly dark, and a lot of the story takes place in shadows or low illumination. Almost everyone lives in an impersonal home seemingly decorated by the same depressed interior designer, with muted colors and generic furnishings that turn each dwelling into a showroom. The characters are less blank largely because of Zahler's writing, his eccentric metaphors and monologues. More prosaic is his hard embrace of the same old-fashioned American anti-authoritarianism -- with its hatred for rules matched only by a love of guns -- that helped define Dirty Harry.

The movie is generally watchable, even at its slowest and ugliest, simply because the actors are solid even when their characters are repellent. Gibson delivers a tamped-down performance, going for stolid, while Vaughn runs his mouth and enjoys his flashy bits. The most sympathetic character, Henry (a fine Tory Kittles), occupies another story line that soon crosses Brett and Anthony's. A newly released ex-con, Henry has a brother who uses a wheelchair and a mother who's been turning tricks while he's been in the pen. Brett has a daughter and a wife who has multiple sclerosis and uses a cane. Zahler seems to want to make Henry a counterweight to the detectives (Brett especially), as if to suggest that they're alike, though their worlds and power couldn't be more different.

This spurious parallelism, though, does suit the movie's dog-eat-dog worldview or its baiting representation of the white characters' racism. Some openly voice their bigotry, which might have been a bold choice if Zahler had interrogated it rather than given himself convenient outs. Anthony makes a joke about Martin Luther King Jr. Day. He also has a black girlfriend, which is presumably meant to complicate his character but instead feels like a directorial hedge. When Brett's wife says that she wasn't a racist until she moved into their crummy neighborhood, her rueful delivery suggests that she was regrettably forced -- dragged across concrete, perhaps -- into prejudice. Zahler just lets her racism hang in the air unanswered, which says plenty.","This neo-exploitation potboiler about brutal men on both sides of the law stars Mel Gibson and Vince Vaughn, and traffics in sordid, ugly shocks.",26bb50c0-30a6-5d74-83a7-61aa19e233cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/03/20/arts/20draggedacross-1/20draggedacross-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=30698fb3f166d5d5374d922f89061e59a8fbb5f8711ed20848f8ab3103b86e6a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Vince Vaughn, left, and Mel Gibson play cops in the neo-exploitation potboiler &ldquo;Dragged Across Concrete.&rdquo;",26bb50c0-30a6-5d74-83a7-61aa19e233cc,N24News/imgs/26bb50c0-30a6-5d74-83a7-61aa19e233cc.jpg,5
Dance,Muse Steps Away,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/05/arts/dance/wendy-whelan-says-farewell-to-city-ballet.html,"""In ballet, if you're over 40, you're a dinosaur,"" Wendy Whelan said, looking distinctly un-dinosaur-like as she sat at her kitchen table in her Upper West Side apartment in Manhattan last month. Her workday had begun at 10 with a two-hour morning ballet class and ended at 7 after a full day of back-to-back rehearsals. She is 47 (""and a half,"" she pointed out) and will leave New York City Ballet, for which she has danced for 30 years, with a farewell performance on Oct. 18. But Ms. Whelan is ready for more. Talking, dancing, seizing her chances. ""I still have so much dancing in me, so much to say,"" she said. ""It's not an end."" For the fans who have watched her carve out an extraordinary career at City Ballet, however, it is most definitely an end and a major milestone in the company's history. Her farewell performance -- which will include a new work created for her by Alexei Ratmansky and Christopher Wheeldon, two of ballet's biggest choreographic names -- sold out within minutes after sales opened to the public.

Ms. Whelan has performed a broader and more varied repertory than almost any other female principal in City Ballet's history, spanning romantic, classical and contemporary roles with extraordinary versatility and range. But although she excelled in, and often seemed definitively to embody, many of the ballets by George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins that form the backbone of the repertoire, she has perhaps been most closely identified with the creation of new ballets, as a kind of muse who enables the best work from choreographers. William Forsythe, Wayne McGregor, Jorma Elo, Benjamin Millepied, Twyla Tharp, Lynn Taylor-Corbett and Peter Martins, the company's ballet master in chief, have, among many others, chosen her for their pieces. (By her count, she has originated 40 principal roles in the repertory.) But her strongest choreographic affiliations over the last 15 years have been with Mr. Wheeldon and Mr. Ratmansky, who have arguably created their finest works with Ms. Whelan. ""I think I first fell in love with the shape of her legs,"" said Mr. Ratmansky, who had been rehearsing with Ms. Whelan earlier in the day on his newest piece for City Ballet, which had its premiere on Thursday. ""The length from ankle to knee and knee to hip is perfectly proportioned, very graceful and strong. The quality of movement really depends on these kinds of structures, and this explained to me a lot about her unusual quality and sensuality. She is a major ballerina, exceptional and different."" That Ms. Whelan is still dancing at a high level, and plans to continue collaborating with choreographers after leaving City Ballet, is itself notable. By dinosaur age, around 40, most female ballet dancers are feeling the severe physical toll taken by the relentless demands of classical technique: turning out from the hips, the constant wear and tear on joints and muscles. Ms. Whelan has been one of the fortunate few who have managed the intersection of technical prowess and mature artistry; until she began to have hip problems in 2012, she was relatively injury free, and after a hip reconstruction last year, she has rebounded with remarkable facility.

Rehearsing ""Polyphonia"" with the choreographer Christopher Wheeldon in 2012. ""She is creating a whole new work with Alexei with people 20 years younger, and she is doing everything, usually better than everyone else,"" said Tyler Angle, who has been one of Ms. Whelan's regular stage partners for the last several years. ""Even in the last rehearsal of the day, when everyone is tired, and we have shows at night, she never lets the energy get bad. She is always open, always willing to work at a problem and try it until you get it right."" In person, Ms. Whelan is smaller than she appears onstage, and has a softer beauty. The apartment that she shares with her husband of nine years, the photographer David Michalek, features a large nude portrait of her that shows the beautiful musculature and lines of her body, shaped by a lifetime of dancing. In conversation, she is warm and generous, laughing easily, but also displaying the will, intelligence and tenacity that have characterized her career. Ms. Whelan grew up in Louisville, Ky., a middle child of an accountant father and a mother who taught women's college basketball. At 3, she was sent to ballet as an outlet for her excessive energy. At 8, she asked to audition for the Louisville Ballet's ""Nutcracker."" Her mother tried to dissuade her. ""What if you don't make it?"" she asked. ""I'm going to make it,"" Ms. Whelan told her. A diagnosis of idiopathic scoliosis, a severe curvature of the spine, at 12, didn't stop her. Wearing a hip-to-shoulder body cast, she continued to attend ballet class at the Louisville Ballet Academy every day.

In 1984, a year after Balanchine's death, Ms. Whelan joined City Ballet as an apprentice; in 1986, she became a full member of the company, then run by Mr. Martins and Robbins. ""It was a complicated time,"" she said. ""There was a lot of heartbreak after Balanchine's death, and a lot of insecurity. People didn't know how Peter felt about them."" Ms. Whelan didn't know either. She worried that her aquiline profile was too sharp, her body too angular, that she wasn't pretty enough to be a ballerina. ""I never felt I was a favorite, or marked out for success,"" she said. ""And in the end, that was a good thing. It drove me nuts, but I always had to climb to where I wanted to be behind someone else, and that paid off for me. I put in the work, and I never took my place in the company for granted."" Her ascent was nonetheless steady; in 1989, she was promoted to soloist, in 1991, to principal dancer. Over the next decade, she danced an extraordinary number of ballets, including several new works created for the Diamond Project festivals. But, it wasn't, Ms. Whelan said, until she started to work with Mr. Wheeldon on his breakthrough ballet, the 2001 ""Polyphonia,"" that she began to find herself as a dancer. ""I had been striving to be authentic in a world where the choreographic deity, Balanchine, was dead,"" she said. ""Then I turned 30, started dancing with Jock Soto, Chris started making stuff for me, and my world opened up."" All this coincided, she added, with a tough breakup with her longtime boyfriend, the dancer Nilas Martins, Peter Martins's son. Jock Soto in Mr. Wheeldon's ""After the Rain"" in 2005. ""I could feel my heart in dancing for the first time,"" she said. ""All those years of being that strong girl, in control. It took all those factors to go beyond that and find who I was as a dancer -- not some idea of what I should be, but me.""

Mr. Wheeldon said that their encounter during the making of ""Polyphonia,"" set to Ligeti extracts, had been pivotal to his career. ""She launched me as a choreographer,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""She challenged me not to settle, and that was a first. Somehow we unlocked something in each other."" Later, he wrote in an email: ""What makes Wendy unique is that she has the inexplicable ability to make abstract movement take on a certain poetry through simplicity. A look, a breath, a sculpted shape. Story always hovering in the air around her."" Mr. Wheeldon went on to create 12 more ballets with Ms. Whelan, notably a transcendent pas de deux, with Mr. Soto, in ""After the Rain"" (2005), in which, whisper-thin in a pale pink leotard, she appeared to float from her partner's arms, air to his earth. In 2006, Mr. Ratmansky picked her for ""Russian Seasons,"" giving her a role, underpinned by notions of death and transformation, that brought out her dramatic gifts and a kind of spiritual incandescence. The ability to transform an extreme muscular control and technical precision into an unearthly, floating beauty hasn't lessened as Ms. Whelan has grown older. But her roles in the Balanchine and Robbins repertoire at City Ballet had decreased over the years, and Ms. Whelan said that she began to feel increasingly dislocated from the life of the company. Mr. Angle and Ms. Whelan in ""Polyphonia"" at the David H. Koch Theater. ""I always thought the 30-year mark would be a good time to retire,"" she said. ""My body at the 30-year mark was ready, too. My body has been so good to me and my surgery, saving my hip, was so miraculous. It's time for me to be good to it back."" Mr. Martins, who said he was sad to see Ms. Whelan leave, added that she had probably worked with more invited choreographers than any other dancer in the company's history. ""She has had an unbelievable career,"" he said.

It's not over. Last year, Ms. Whelan put together ""Restless Creature,"" a program featuring four duets -- by the contemporary choreographers Kyle Abraham, Joshua Beamish, Brian Brooks and Alejandro Cerrudo -- that she performed at the Jacob's Pillow festival in Becket, Mass., with each man. Alastair Macaulay, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, has frequently been critical of Ms. Whelan's dancing, describing tension in her shoulders and a lack of upper and lower body coordination. But reviewing ""Restless Creature,"" he wrote: ""She's uncompromising, generous, bold, enthusiastic, adult, at the same time decisive and investigative. Few dancers in any genre show better that a work should be a process of self-discovery."" Her hip surgery forced a postponement of an American tour, but Ms. Whelan and her four partners will take ""Restless Creature"" around the country from January to May next year, and she will perform a program of new work with the Royal Ballet principal Edward Watson in London in July 2015. She has other projects up her sleeve, including a collaboration with Mr. Michalek, and the puppet-maker extraordinaire Basil Twist, and an appointment at City Center as an artistic associate. For the moment, she said, she isn't interested in running a ballet company. ""More than anyone, I think most about Misha Baryshnikov as paving the direction I hope to follow,"" she said. ""He is the consummate artist, always trying new things with the widest range of people across so many different disciplines."" Later, she leaned back in her chair, and smiled, her eyes flashing. ""It doesn't have to be all dance,"" she said. ""I'm up for anything.""","Wendy Whelan, a principal dancer with New York City Ballet, will give her farewell performance on Oct. 18.",7aa188ec-f9fe-5c3b-b2ed-48ccc94ca2e5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/10/05/arts/05WHELAN/05WHELAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=396&w=600&s=688ca3cee09abb9c49cca01882fc835ebca84f76d3d9a2527241c1fabf7bdb5f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The New York City Ballet principal Wendy Whelan in her dressing room at Lincoln Center.,7aa188ec-f9fe-5c3b-b2ed-48ccc94ca2e5,N24News/imgs/7aa188ec-f9fe-5c3b-b2ed-48ccc94ca2e5.jpg,6
Real Estate,Standing Out in a Glassy West Chelsea,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/11/15/realestate/standing-out-in-a-glassy-west-chelsea.html,"Tall, slender and glassy might be the design choice du jour, but a condominium rising in West Chelsea harks back to an era when terra-cotta and copper signaled the pinnacle of luxury.

Sales began this month at the Fitzroy, a condo at 514 West 24th Street between 10th and 11th Avenues, just steps from the High Line. With a lush green terra-cotta facade and oversize copper-clad windows, it is reminiscent of Art Deco. Designed by Roman and Williams -- the husband-and-wife team known for their abundant use of Edison bulbs, vintage furniture and reclaimed wood -- the building evokes a bygone age of grand manses.

""We've always fought the fight against blandness and synthetics,"" said Stephen Alesch, a principal of Roman and Williams, sitting in his Lafayette Street office with his wife and co-principal, Robin Standefer. ""We'll never be finished trying to put a dent in the synthetic movement that's blanketed the earth with coldness.""

The Fitzroy's prewar aesthetic extends to its interiors, too. In a break from the open-concept kitchen that is a standard feature in contemporary homes, Fitzroy kitchens are enclosed. Cabinets have a dark, nearly black rustic finish, set against a copper backsplash and hanging, schoolhouse-style pendant lights. Because the building is clad in terra cotta and not glass, it does not have the floor-to-ceiling, wraparound glass common in many new developments. The result: plenty of wall space to hang pictures.","Tall, slender and glassy might be the design choice du jour, but a condo rising in West Chelsea harks back to an era when terra-cotta, copper and ornate finishes signaled the pinnacle of luxury.",f01d44d2-143f-54e0-a4c0-a44c1a4e2599,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/11/15/realestate/15FITZROY/15fitzroy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=cfd25921964d6dd5def9105be438a901dc3c64817cd39f13e404539bd3251f87&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The 10-story Fitzroy condo at 514 West 24th Street, just steps from the High Line, will have a lush green terra-cotta facade and oversize copper-clad windows reminiscent of prewar Art Deco.

Science,Ancient Romans Hunted 'Sea Monsters.' Were They Whales?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/16/science/ancient-romans-whales.html,"There's an ancient Greco-Roman poem that tells the tale of brave fishermen who harpooned a sea monster. Once they hooked the beast, the men reeled it in from their rowboats near the shore and hauled it onto the beach. The text, which is dated to the second or third century, describes one onlooker as standing on a cliff and beholding the ""tremendous toil of the men in this warfare of the sea."" But was this ""sea monster,"" or ""cetus"" as it is called in Latin, actually a whale? A study published Wednesday provides the first direct evidence that two whale species, the gray whale and the North Atlantic right whale, may have lived near Mediterranean shores some 2,000 years ago. Today these whales are not found in the Mediterranean Sea. The finding, which was published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, expands the historical range of the whale species and suggests they once roamed the same waters as the ancient Romans.

""We show the Romans had the means, technology and the opportunity for a whaling industry,"" said Ana Rodrigues, an ecologist from the Center for Functional and Evolutionary Ecology in France and lead author of the study. ""But we don't prove that they did."" [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] Dr. Rodrigues and her colleagues obtained ten suspected whale bones collected from sites in Spain and Morocco near the Strait of Gibraltar. The team genetically analyzed the DNA from the bones and found that two belonged to gray whales and three belonged to right whales. Most of the other bones belonged to sea creatures that live in the Mediterranean today, such as a fin whale, a sperm whale, a long-finned pilot whale and a dolphin. Unexpectedly, one belonged to an African elephant. Unlike the other whale species discovered during the research, gray whales and North Atlantic right whales are known to swim near the shoreline to reproduce and birth their calves, which could have made them targets for Roman hunters.

More bones and additional evidence will need to be uncovered before scientists can confidently say that ancient Roman whaling occurred. It is possible the whale bones the team analyzed belonged to stranded or dead whales that the Romans scavenged. Vicki Szabo, an environmental historian from Western Carolina University in North Carolina, who was not involved in the study, said although the finding does not provide strong enough evidence to claim that ancient Romans were whaling commercially, it does provide a starting point for that interpretation. She added that it also provides historical perspective to understanding the ecology of the two whale species. ""This proposition that they were as far south as the Mediterranean, maybe breeding off the coast of Iberia and having a calving ground, that's exciting,"" Dr. Szabo said.

She added that the findings may encourage other researchers to revisit their Roman period collections and genetically test their marine animal bones to see if they belonged to ancient whales, especially North Atlantic right whales which are on the brink of extinction, she said. Only about 450 remain in their population, and researchers have seen no newborns this year. ""Their population is incredibly at risk,"" said Dr. Szabo. ""If we can go into those bones and try to look at their genetic profile from the past we can better understand the species today.""","Testing of archaeological remains show that two whale species once swam in the Mediterranean, suggesting that the Romans conducted industrial-scale whaling.",2a4eadbe-bd75-5c43-bede-6853dc4fa42e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/17/science/17TB-ROMANWHALING6/17TB-ROMANWHALING6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=47cd613accd70ba18582999600ffd6d3f2faef742b7a869d03950f8bd299b965&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A detail of ""La Carta Marina,"" a 16th-century illustration by Olau Magnus, with sea creatures that conform to descriptions by the ancient Roman historian Pliny the Elder, including gray and killer whales.",2a4eadbe-bd75-5c43-bede-6853dc4fa42e,N24News/imgs/2a4eadbe-bd75-5c43-bede-6853dc4fa42e.jpg,2
Movies,Martin Lawrence on Explosions On and Offscreen,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/16/movies/martin-lawrence-bad-boys-for-life.html,"Lawrence in a scene from the newest installment in the ""Bad Boys"" franchise.





Martin Lawrence is not running quite like he used to, but he's feeling just fine. The comedian and actor pulled a muscle shooting a footrace with Will Smith in their new movie, ""Bad Boys for Life,"" the third in a hit buddy-cop franchise that was birthed 25 years ago. This installment, not surprisingly, has a number of jokes about its leads getting older. (The ""ride together, die together"" tagline could be changed to ""dye together,"" now that Smith's character needs to touch up the gray in his goatee.) And yet it still has the high-octane action that defines these movies. Lawrence's character, Marcus Burnett, much like Lawrence now, is a little reflective. They've both had long careers with ups and downs, and are thinking about their pasts as well as their futures. In a phone interview between appearances in New York, Lawrence, 54, spoke about his break from movies, comedy today, his work on the self-titled sitcom that solidified his stardom in the '90s and whether, after a controversial turn hosting ""Saturday Night Live,"" he still watches that show. Here are edited excerpts from that conversation. ""Bad Boys for Life"" is your first major film role since ""Big Mommas: Like Father, Like Son"" in 2011. Why did you take that long a break from starring in films?

I hadn't gotten any scripts that I felt were good enough or that I wanted to be involved in. And I was dealing with some personal things in my life. I lost my mother. I lost my father. I lost my oldest brother. And so it just was a time for me to take to myself, spiritually, and reconnect and just get through. The idea of making another ""Bad Boys"" sequel had been under consideration for a while. What ultimately brought you back? Well first and foremost, working with Will again. Having that opportunity to work with one of the best in the business once again was a great joy for me. And the fact that we had a great script that we thought was worthy of giving people nothing less than the first two. Part of the fun of these movies is the banter between your characters. Did you two improvise jokes? We did it less in this film. In the others, we ad-libbed a lot more. In this one, a lot of it was mostly on the page.

Were there any challenges on set this time around, with particular action moments? Yeah, I wasn't able to work out as much before the film because I had hurt my back onstage when I was on tour. So when we did a running scene, I pulled a muscle. We had to use my stunt guys. But when you see it on film, you wouldn't know that.

Are you ready to make more movies after doing this? Yeah, but I don't want to be making movies just to be making movies. I don't want to do anything that's not worthy of my time. I want to work with good people on good movies. You're hosting a comedy tour again this year. What's different about comedy now and the comedians you're working with, as opposed to when you were hosting Def Comedy Jam? There really isn't a difference. The comics were going for it back when I was doing Def Comedy Jam. And the comics that I take out on the Lit tour, they're going for it too, seizing the moment and taking advantage of their time.

Do you see stand-up as your first love? Most definitely. Stand-up is my baby. It's where I started. You have a lot of well-established comics, like Lil Rel Howery, Adele Givens and Hannibal Buress, on your tour. Are there other comedians outside of those that you find interesting? No, the ones I'm working with I find interesting. I'm not concerned about what everybody else is doing.

Is there anything you see in the comedy world now that you feel is a direct result of your influence? I think people are able to be more honest, blunt and forthcoming now. I took hits when I got an NC-17 for my ""You So Crazy"" film [in 1994]. And as a result of that, comics can say what they want to say. There was also a strong reaction to the time you hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" in 1994 and your opening monologue, which got you banned from the show.

I have no comment on ""Saturday Night Live,"" that's not my thing. I had my time on there, and it was what it was and I've moved on with my life. Do you watch it at all anymore? The only time I watched it was when Eddie [Murphy] was just on there. If the Martin Lawrence of today were able to talk to the Martin Lawrence from 25 years ago, what advice would you give him? I'd say be more patient, more understanding of situations that are beyond your control. Learn how to grow to be a better person each day and give the best of yourself. What is your favorite character that you created for ""Martin""? Sheneneh, Jerome and Otis are the ones that stand out for me. The attitude of Sheneneh reminds me of my nieces and my sisters, how they can get on you and put you in your place real quick. Otis is the old man who doesn't let you take old people for granted. And Jerome is just that player that's cool and everybody wants to be around.

Health,Why Is Obamacare Enrollment Down?,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/06/health/obamacare-enrollment-aca.html,"More than halfway through the sign-up period for Obamacare health plans, fewer people have enrolled in coverage than during the same stretch last year. Enrollment through the federal website Healthcare.gov, which manages insurance marketplaces in 39 states, is down 11 percent compared to 2017, according to government figures released Thursday. Given President Trump's assault on the law, many people are watching this year's enrollment closely for clues to its durability. While it is too soon to draw any firm conclusions, there are several reasons sign-ups could be lower -- and not all of them spell trouble for the landmark legislation. It's important to remember that every year, there's a surge in people who sign up at the last minute, right before the deadline, which is Dec. 15 this year. Moreover, customers can automatically renew their plans, and those renewals don't get counted in the enrollment tally until later. Also, the latest sign-up numbers don't include enrollments from 11 states and the District of Columbia that operate their own marketplaces. Those are reported separately and many of these states are reporting higher enrollment. Still, several experts believe that the slow start in enrollment this year is likely to mean a smaller Obamacare market for 2019.

""Based on what we know now I would be shocked if enrollment was higher this year than last year,"" said Josh Peck, a co-founder of the group Get America Covered and the former chief marketing officer for Healthcare.gov during the Obama administration. The final numbers for the federal marketplace should come out before the end of the year. Here are some of the forces that may be influencing people's decisions. The mandate is gone As part of its massive tax overhaul, Congress eliminated Obamacare's individual mandate, the tax penalty for people who refused to get health insurance, beginning this year. That means people who were nudged into coverage by the threat of paying a fine may be sitting out this year. But it's hard to know how many people are dropping out because the penalty disappeared. Awareness of the change appears to be low, and enrollment is also down in New Jersey, one of the states that adopted its own individual mandate. There are new options outside the ACA marketplace The Trump administration also loosened restrictions about buying plans that don't meet the standards set by Obamacare. Starting this enrollment season, people can buy coverage that is skimpier, but often much less expensive.

Rising premiums have priced some people who do not qualify for subsidies out of the Obamacare market, and there is some early evidence that more people who would have to pay full price for a plan are buying the so-called short-term plans instead. (But those plans aren't available to people with pre-existing conditions.) Those shoppers tend not to be in the Obamacare market anyway. People are signing up for Medicaid instead The state with the biggest enrollment decline is Virginia. In that case, the drop can be explained by the state's recent expansion of its Medicaid program, an option the Affordable Care Act encourages by committing the federal government to pay at least 90 percent of the expansion costs. By expanding Medicaid, Virginia made free government insurance available to low-income residents who had previously been buying coverage in the marketplace. Now, many appear to be switching to that. Other states that have also expanded Medicaid have shown similar patterns of declining enrollment in the number of people signing up for Obamacare. But at the same time, they showed overall reductions in their number of uninsured residents, which is the ultimate goal of the law. As the unemployment rate drops, more Americans may be getting health insurance coverage from work. That too is a factor that could be driving down enrollment in Obamacare plans. Because unemployment has been falling since the Obamacare coverage first became available, it's probably not a huge factor, but a tighter labor market could be reducing the overall number of people who need coverage. For some people, the plans are less affordable Prices always matter, and the prices people pay for Obamacare plans can be very different from the sticker price. Last year, the sticker price for plans increased substantially. But for customers who qualified for subsidies, the prices they paid themselves actually went down. Many were delighted to find they did not have to pay anything for coverage. This year, the sticker price of plans has declined slightly in many parts of the country. But for those people who get subsidies, typically about 85 percent of the market, prices may be going up a little in those places -- and people may not be able to find a free plan this year.

Ironically, places with more competition tend to have slightly higher prices for people with subsidies, and more insurers have entered the market this year in some parts of the country. ""There are fewer zero-dollar plans because there is competition,"" said Katherine Hempstead, a senior adviser at the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. Still, for most people who receive subsidies, a plan is available for less than $75 a month. They are likely to find Obamacare plans are still the best buy. ""The people who are subsidized are pretty insulated,"" said Edmund Haislmaier, a senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. People don't know they need to sign up To get coverage, people need to know that the open enrollment period is happening now. Last year, the Trump administration slashed funding for advertising and other forms of marketing by 90 percent, and those funds weren't restored this year. Research suggests that advertising does influence enrollment, and some experts say that the effects of lower outreach may compound over time, as fewer and fewer people in need of health insurance remember how the Obamacare market works. There is also less media and grass-roots publicity. Last year, when the price of coverage spiked and there was intense debate over whether to repeal Obamacare, the marketplace was the focus of intense news coverage. This year, with flatter premiums and a raucous midterm election, there has been less media attention on the enrollment period. ""There were a lot of Obama alumni and patient advocacy groups who were pushing hard on enrollment, maybe seeing it as part of the resistance movement,"" said Cynthia Cox, the director of the program for the study of health reform and private insurance at the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""I just haven't been seeing as much of it this year.""","Sign-ups for health plans are 11 percent lower than last year, as the December 15 deadline approaches. Here are some possible reasons.",57b05ea3-1e96-5e84-9266-135591d914ae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/07/science/07ACA-EXPLAINER-print/07ACA-EXPLAINER1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=8edaee5818203aa54c39df72f668eb1d032bb67220f4dfe0266f9e12fd28874c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A free medical clinic in Virginia.

Food,Craft Beer Looks Beyond 'Young White Dudes With Beards',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/dining/drinks/craft-beer-diversity-ambassador.html,"Thousands of craft beer brewers across the country have a problem: Sales are slowing, tastes are changing and stiff competition is coming from new directions. Wine and spirits have cut into market share. Cannabis deregulation looms. Despite a dozen years of growth in the industry, some people in the business are wondering aloud if the ""post-craft"" era is nigh, and some are embracing the opportunity to broaden their appeal. From niche beers to inviting taprooms and branding, the business is formally investing in its cultural diversity as never before. Not just because brewers think it's the right move -- because it's a smart move, too. ""If you are going to grow, you cannot simply sell beer to young white dudes with beards,"" J. Nikol Jackson-Beckham said in May, in her opening address as the first diversity ambassador for the Brewers Association, craft brewing's largest trade group, which represents nearly 7,000 small, independent brewers. Over the last year, she has traveled to brewers' guilds and industry conferences, and developed guidelines and resources to help brewers make their workplaces, customers and brands more inclusive. She also worked with organizers of the inaugural Fresh Fest, an event in Pittsburgh last August that billed itself as the country's first for African-American beer enthusiasts, in what she called a ""pilot case"" that will inform how the association can best support more events like it.

Dr. Jackson-Beckham, who teaches at Randolph College in Lynchburg, Va., has been a home brewer and beer scholar for years. Her appointment last spring was perhaps the most significant and visible move yet in an industrywide effort to make craft brewing culture as diverse as its beers. Even as domestic sales of craft beer reached a record-setting $26 billion in 2017, that figure was just eight percent higher than sales in 2016. In most industries, those numbers might be cause for celebration, but for American craft brewers, who enjoyed even stronger boom times earlier in the decade, it looks more like a slowdown. There is plenty of room for craft beer to grow outside the demographic of white men ages 21 to 50. Just 31 percent of women say they drink craft beer ""several times a year or more often,"" compared with 49 percent of men, according to data from Nielsen-Harris on Demand; that's up from 25 percent of women in 2015. But even as ""craft is doing better with females,"" said Bart Watson, the Brewers Association's chief economist, the category ""hasn't changed its race/ethnicity mix very much."" For years, macrobrewers like Anheuser-Busch InBev and MillerCoors have pitched their brands to minority and underserved populations to shore up sales as one-time customers switched to wine, spirits or even craft beer. But brewers must walk a fine line as they seek to diversify their staffs and their fans, so the changes do not come off as a feeble attempt to make money.

[Now Being Held Hostage by the Shutdown: Your Favorite Craft Brewery] Marketing ""is where a lot of the conversation and press has been,"" said Dr. Jackson-Beckham, noting that in recent years, the online craft beer community has policed offensive beer labels and names, and criticized the brewers behind them. Now, many breweries are finding ways to sell beers to underrepresented drinkers respectfully. In Albuquerque, Bow & Arrow Brewing Company caters to Native Americans in the city's Wells Park neighborhood. ""We like to be able to share our passion with other folks like us,"" said Shyla Sheppard, who owns the brewery with her partner, Missy Begay. Ms. Sheppard is a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and Ms. Begay is Navajo. ""Our buddies are Native professionals: doctors and lawyers or even farmers and ranchers.""

Bow & Arrow's Rancho Bizarro is a series of sour ales with label art created by the indigenous illustrator Dale Deforest. The brewery has also used Navajo tea in a limited-edition grisette beer, with plans to incorporate more indigenous ingredients in new brews. ""I'm not a Pollyanna. I know it's driven by sales,"" said Gonzalo J. Quintero, a community activist and current adviser for San Diego State University's craft brewing certification program. He said craft brewers in his area, like Thorn Brewing in the city's Barrio Logan area, have created Mexican-style lagers because ""they see that's a style of beer that appeals to a wide audience."" Making beer Baja-style to celebrate the Mexican brewing tradition requires a level of cultural appreciation and sensitivity. ""There's ways to do things and be culturally appropriate"" and not engage in cultural appropriation, Dr. Quintero said.

Staffing is another way breweries are becoming more inclusive. If there's someone who looks like you behind the bar, the logic goes, you may feel more comfortable ordering a pint. ""We bring a lot of diversity into the community just by being a bar that employs people who are not old white people,"" said Erik Lars Myers, a founder of Mystery Brewing Company in Hillsborough, N.C. Still, embracing cultural diversity is no panacea for the realities of a competitive market. Despite Mystery Brewing's earning national acclaim for brewing a fund-raising ""protest beer"" in dissent of North Carolina's contentious ""bathroom bill,"" it closed in October, citing undercapitalization and bad luck. And not everyone who likes craft beer feels the same way about social progress. In April, Tired Hands Brewing Company, a craft brewery in Ardmore, Pa., posted a job for a diversity internship, hoping to draw female and minority student applicants. On social media, reactions were hostile.","Faced with slowing sales growth, some brewers are looking to reach a new, more diverse audience.",a12e1345-04a7-5493-b90b-85455f7de95d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/09/autossell/09BEER01/09BEER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=58a2e4739705db4bccd4b346a1720882013d5f5ddda4d1b75c2efb4670bd8076&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dr. J.

Opinion,"Sorry, Senators. This Is No Time for a Vacation.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/04/opinion/coronavirus-relief-bill-senate-recess.html,"On Friday, Congress effectively pushed millions of Americans off a financial cliff when it failed to extend the enhanced unemployment benefits put in place in March to soften the economic pain of the coronavirus pandemic. Millions of Americans are also in imminent danger of losing their homes as federal moratoriums on evictions expire.

Preventing this widespread suffering should be the top priority for lawmakers. Instead, the Republican-led Senate dragged its feet for months on another aid package. The Democratic-led House of Representatives passed a $3 trillion relief plan in mid-May. It took until July 27 for the Republican Senate leaders to offer their anemic, $1 trillion counterbid, which everyone seems to have a problem with, albeit for differing reasons. Democrats think it is insufficient to the magnitude of the crisis. The White House favors a short-term, piecemeal fix -- larded with unrelated measures, like $1.75 billion for a new F.B.I. headquarters and nearly $400 million to renovate the West Wing -- and many Republican members oppose any additional relief.

Negotiations are, to put it mildly, going poorly. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, is engaged in a political charade in which he proclaims himself a hapless bystander, buffeted by the whims of the White House on one side and House Democrats on the other. He is not even attending key meetings between Democratic leaders and the administration's top negotiators.

But Mr. McConnell is far from without leverage. He must make clear to his members that they need to compromise and help the millions of their fellow Americans who are stuck in miles-long food lines, a hair's breadth from eviction, jobless, financially ruined or ill because of this terrible disease.

Economy,Fed Chair Powell Warns Pandemic Downturn Could Widen Inequalities,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/economy/coronavirus-jerome-powell-federal-reserve.html,"WASHINGTON -- Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, told lawmakers on Tuesday that the economy's nascent rebound was likely to take a long time to reach all corners of the job market -- and that already-disadvantaged groups were likely to suffer the most if the downturn drags on. While some parts of the economy are seeing a modest rebound, ""levels of output and employment remain far below their pre-pandemic levels, and significant uncertainty remains about the timing and strength of the recovery,"" Mr. Powell told the Senate Banking Committee. Mr. Powell suggested repeatedly that while it was good news that employers were beginning to hire workers, it could take a long time to get back to the strong labor market that prevailed before the coronavirus pandemic shut down large sectors of the economy, forcing tens of millions out of work. And he told lawmakers that more support from Congress and the Fed could be needed to get the economy back to full health. ""The shock that we received -- the economy received -- was the largest in living memory,"" Mr. Powell said, noting that the fiscal and monetary policy response has also been the largest on record.

""The question we will all have to answer over time is: Is it enough?"" he said. ""I would say there's a reasonable probability that more will be needed, both from you and from the Fed."" The economic stakes are high. Mr. Powell stressed that the longer the pandemic went on, the longer lasting the damage from the downturn could be, particularly for lower-income workers. Time out of the work force could erode workers' skills, he said. ""Low-income households have experienced, by far, the sharpest drop in employment, while job losses of African-Americans, Hispanics and women have been greater than that of other groups,"" Mr. Powell said. ""If not contained and reversed, the downturn could further widen gaps in economic well-being that the long expansion had made some progress in closing."" Mr. Powell began his two-day semiannual testimony before Senate and House lawmakers as communities across the United States continue to protest systemic racial inequality after George Floyd, a black man, was killed while in the custody of Minneapolis police in late May. Black Americans are often at a stark disadvantage in the labor market, and along with other minority groups, they have been hard hit by pandemic-era job losses. Mr. Powell told lawmakers that the central bank was focused on ensuring that the labor market, which had finally begun to benefit minority workers before the virus hit, has the support it needs to recover. If it does, low- and moderate-income people may be able to make gains again.

""What we learned during the last long expansion is that a tight job market is probably the best single thing that the Fed can do to support all low- to moderate-income communities,"" which are disproportionately minority, he said. ""Everything we are doing is to try to get the labor market back to where it was in February of 2020,"" when the jobless rate was around 3.5 percent. The Fed chair told lawmakers that a full economic recovery was unlikely until the public was confident that the disease was contained, and he warned that an extended period of weakness could be damaging for some sectors, particularly small businesses, which face ""acute risks"" from the pandemic. The Fed has already cut rates to near zero, is buying large quantities of government-backed debt, and has unveiled a series of emergency lending programs to keep the economy and credit markets functioning. At the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting last week, Fed officials signaled that they expected to keep rates unchanged through 2022. But even with its crisis powers, the central bank has the ability only to lend via credit facilities that help municipalities and businesses, not to spend. That means that direct support for households and smaller businesses in the form of grants has fallen to Congress.

* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. Lawmakers have enacted substantial fiscal stimulus, with Congress approving direct payments to individuals and funding for small-business loans. While the central bank noted in its Monetary Policy Report to Congress, released last week, that the fiscal policy response so far ""constitutes the fastest and largest fiscal response to any postwar economic downturn,"" it signaled that the path to recovery remained ""extraordinarily uncertain,"" and highlighted that state governments in particular were coming under stress. Mr. Powell reiterated that while the Fed was ""committed to using our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time,"" its response to the crisis was only part of what was needed. Legislation can ""provide direct help to people, businesses and communities,"" he said. ""This direct support can make a critical difference not just in helping families and businesses in a time of need, but also in limiting long-lasting damage to our economy.""

He indicated that lawmakers should consider how to help service workers who have been displaced and will struggle to return to work. ""That's something I'd be looking at, is -- what kind of support will they need?"" he said. ""I do think you'll want to continue support for workers in some form. I think that there are going to be an awful lot of unemployed people for some time,"" Mr. Powell said. ""Even if we start putting people back to work really fast, which may happen here, there are still going to be plenty of people who don't have jobs and that may not have them for a while because there are no jobs in travel, accommodation, various places."" More than 100 economists, including two former Fed chairs and three former White House economists, called on Congress to pass another coronavirus relief package before the end of the summer, warning that more needed to be done in order to support economic recovery during the pandemic. The next legislation, the economists wrote on Tuesday, ""should provide, at a minimum, continued support for the unemployed, new assistance to states and localities, investments in programs that preserve the employer-employee relationship, and additional aid to stabilize aggregate demand."" A smaller group of prominent economists from both sides of the aisle, joined by a former Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, also detailed a proposal on Tuesday on what Congress should fund to stabilize the economy. Their report includes a call to renew the expanded unemployment benefits, but phase them down over time, and to create a temporary new pandemic earned-income tax credit to supplement the salaries of Americans who return to work. It would continue government support for hard-hit businesses and send at least $500 billion to states and local governments to help avert cuts to public education and other services, while restricting states from using the money to address pre-existing pension shortfalls or finance new tax cuts. Lawmakers, however, have shown varying degrees of enthusiasm for further action. While House Democrats approved a $3 trillion stimulus law in May to further address the economic toll, Senate Republicans remain divided over what another coronavirus relief package should look like, with some voicing skepticism about whether another sweeping round of federal aid is needed as the economy slowly starts to reopen.","Jerome H.

A Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate, Edelman settled into pursuing a master's of business administration at Yale. Though he played ice hockey while growing up in suburban Boston and made the team at M.I.T., sports had never been his primary calling. He seemed ready to move on.

Yet the lure of the Olympic Games can make people act in surprising ways. Parents subject their children to coaches who blur the line between discipline and abuse. Runners foolishly starve themselves to lose weight, believing lighter bodies will mean more speed. And athletes like Edelman sign up again for repeated brain-rattling rides at 75 miles per hour, even when they have had headaches, blurred vision, dizziness, depression, exhaustion and other symptoms associated with traumatic brain injuries. And even as there is a growing awareness about a series of deaths from overdoses, suicides and lingering neurological problems that former athletes in sledding sports have experienced in recent years.

Now Edelman, who has taken a break from business school, has decided to try another sledding sport, becoming a bobsled driver and aiming to reach the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing. ""I know I am going to get hurt brain-wise doing this,"" Edelman, 29, wrote in a recent text message. He also expects to spend more than $100,000 of his own money on the effort, which will mean draining his savings, borrowing what he can, seeking donors and trying to auction off his Olympic ring. ""The mission is more important than my health or savings.""

The bobsled feels safer to him, he said, because he sits upright and can see where he is going. His family is still concerned. After an article about the dangers of sledding sports appeared in The New York Times this summer, Edelman texted his father, a cardiologist and a professor of biomedical engineering, asking him not to show the article to his mother. ""Only 2 seasons. I'm out after 2022, no matter what,"" he wrote to his father. Making the Olympic Games generally requires years of practice, beginning at an early age. Bobsled and skeleton are the rare exceptions, and that is part of the appeal for Edelman. They are sports with perhaps 1,000 athletes combined globally (the exact number is difficult to quantify), with little recreational participation. Many of the sports' athletes had barely heard of bobsled or skeleton until they were adults. Then someone -- a coach, another athlete, a stranger in a gym -- suggested their strength and speed, honed for years in track and field, or football or rugby, might transfer well to these little-known Olympic sports. Lolo Jones, the standout hurdler, competed in bobsled at the 2018 Winter Games and is trying for 2022.

There are only 16 bobsled tracks in the world. Four are in Germany, and many of the others are in remote mountain towns, which helps make sledding sports among the most inaccessible in the world. Also, sleds are expensive, about $40,000 for a used model and $100,000 for a new one. And yet that inaccessibility is what ultimately makes elite-level participation accessible. Because almost no one outside Germany grows up as a bobsledder, someone like Edelman can share a world-class distinction with Michael Phelps -- being an Olympian.

""There is a big expense and you have to get to a place where there is a track, so these aren't the easiest sports to get into, but almost anyone can try it,"" said David Greaves, who became an Israeli citizen two decades ago and leads Bobsled/Skeleton Israel, the national governing body, from his home in Canada. ""It's doable if you have decent athletic ability and you are in some ways fearless, because very few people get on the sled a second time."" Edelman was eligible for Israeli citizenship because he is Jewish, and he had fallen in love with the country during a high school trip there. In 2014, Edelman realized he had a shot at becoming an Olympian by representing Israel in a sledding sport. A Mediterranean country that is half-desert, Israel had never had an athlete compete in Olympic bobsled, skeleton or luge (feet-first sledding) and barely funds those sports.

Learning technique from YouTube videos, Edelman took as many skeleton runs as he could to make up for lost time, sometimes hurtling down the track nine times in a single day. That volume of training is three times what most experienced athletes endure. Many of the sport's coaches and officials now acknowledge that excessive daily training runs increase the likelihood of brain injuries, even if crashes do not occur. In 2018, two years after becoming an Israeli citizen, Edelman qualified for the Olympics in South Korea, Israel's first Olympic competitor in skeleton. Edelman mitigated the risks of brain injury by using a longer face shield that allowed him to rest his head on the sled, limiting the chances that his head would bang off the ice as gravitational forces spiked around tight turns. He used the technique in several international races, but a last-minute ruling by skeleton officials in South Korea prevented him from using it in the Olympics. He beat only athletes from Jamaica and Ghana.

Then, late last year, his depression and other lingering effects of skeleton training abated, and he felt the pull of the Olympic rings again. He impressed an Australian coach during a trial bobsled run. The coach told Edelman if he trained hard and found some strong, fast teammates to push the sled, he could qualify for the next Winter Olympics. Edelman recruited three Israeli Arabs who play for the national rugby team to push the bobsled and tuck behind him for the 50-second runs down the ice. The men, Amir and Ward Fawarsy, who are cousins, and Moran Nijem, are students at the Wingate Institute for Physical Education and Sports in Netanya, a seaside city in Israel. Until this month, they had yet to ride in a bobsled or see a track in person. Much of what they knew about the sport before they met Edelman they learned by watching ""Cool Runnings,"" the 1993 movie loosely based on Jamaica's bobsled team at the 1988 Winter Olympics.

Nijem and the Fawarsy cousins joined Edelman in late December in South Korea, where Edelman has been working on his driving skills. Edelman plans to have more than 200 practice runs by the end of the season -- which would mean two to three runs a day three or four days a week through the winter. Greaves said Bobsled/Skeleton Israel had hired Aliyah Snyder, a neuropsychologist and former skeleton athlete to develop safety protocols. Snyder spent years recovering from brain injuries, she said in an interview last month. Qualification is hardly guaranteed for the Israeli team, especially with the coronavirus pandemic limiting travel and making it more difficult for sleds to achieve the necessary number of races and quality performances to make it to the Olympics. Nijem said he was not worried about the potential danger of getting into a sled with a novice driver still learning how not to flip a 200-pound sled on a treacherous curves. ""If A.J. crashes, we still trust him,"" he said in an interview last month. ""We are rugby players,"" Amir Fawarsy added. ""We know all about concussions.""",A.J.

Opinion,Trump and His Allies Think They Know Who Counts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/07/opinion/trump-2020-census.html,"Over the last few years, the Trump administration has fought to shape the 2020 census to its political benefit and the benefit of the Republican Party. In 2018, it sought to introduce a citizenship question on the census itself, to reduce response rates among immigrant communities. Then, after that was rebuffed by the Supreme Court, it tried to exclude unauthorized immigrants altogether, in direct conflict with the Constitution, which calls on Congress to count ""the whole number of persons in each State."" Now it wants to cut the census short and deliver it uncompleted -- a last-ditch effort to rig the nation's politics for the sake of its exclusionary political vision. The goal is to freeze political representation in place as much as possible; to keep demographic change -- the growing share of Americans who are Black, Hispanic and Asian-American -- from swamping the Republican Party's ability to win national elections with a white, heavily rural minority. The census, as Trump and his allies correctly understand, is a critical source of dynamism within the American political system. A political majority (or in Trump's case, a minority) can try to insulate itself from demographic shifts and transformations, but the fact of mandatory reapportionment makes that difficult. New people -- whether immigrants or Americans moving from place to place -- will always mean new politics. It is ironic, then, that the origin of the census lies less in principles of democratic representation, and more in the interests of slaveholders, who wanted political recognition of their slave wealth, with constitutional assurance that this peculiar interest would always weigh on future apportionment. But in a perfect example of unintended consequences, the slaveholders' push for a census would help lay the groundwork for the end of the institution itself.

The decennial federal census comes out of the fight over congressional representation at the Constitutional Convention. Upon gathering in Philadelphia in 1787, the delegates agreed quickly that the United States should have a bicameral legislature, in keeping with the Virginia Plan, James Madison's blueprint for a new national government. They agreed, too, that the lower house of Congress should be directly elected by voters, with the upper house chosen indirectly. But they disagreed, sharply, over apportionment. Madison's plan called for apportioning representation in both chambers of the national legislature according to ""the quotas of contribution, or to the number of free inhabitants, as the one or the other rule may seem best in different cases."" Proportional representation, he thought, would lead larger states like Pennsylvania and his native Virginia to join the union, since they would have greater say in government. As would the smaller states of the lower South -- North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia -- which were expected to experience rapid growth as a result of new migrants and the ""natural increase"" of slaves. Of course, it wouldn't be so easy. Under the original Articles of Confederation, each state claimed equal representation in Congress. Small state delegates like those from Delaware and Connecticut liked that arrangement and sought to preserve it as much as possible. Against supporters of population-based apportionment -- who noted it was ""the rights of the people composing"" the states who deserved representation -- small state delegates argued that the federal government was to be formed for states ""in their political capacity, as well as for the individuals composing them."" Besides, they continued, larger states would dominate the government if the convention abandoned the principle of equal representation. The solution, as most Americans know, was the ""Great Compromise,"" in which equal state voting would survive in the Senate and proportional representation would prevail in the House of Representatives. This was a momentous decision, not just because it kept the convention from falling apart, although it did, but because it dictated the shape of the compromise over how to actually proportion representation.

At the time, Michael J. Klarman, a legal historian, noted in ""The Framers' Coup: The Making of the United States Constitution,"" that ""most elite statesmen believed that political representation ought to reflect wealth as well as population"" and ""several state constitutions provided for legislative apportionment based partly on wealth."" As Charles Cotesworth Pinckney of South Carolina argued, the South's ""superior wealth"" should have ""its due weight in the government."" And northern delegates like Rufus King of Massachusetts sympathized with this view, confessing he ""had always expected that as the southern states are the richest, they would not league themselves with the northern unless some respect were paid to their superior wealth."" If equal state representation -- which disregarded the size and wealth of each state -- was the rule for the Senate, then proportional representation in the House had to factor in wealth, including the ownership of slaves, the major economic interest for the South. This led us to the three-fifths clause, based off a proposed ""federal ratio"" for taxation under the Articles, which ensured slave wealth representation. ""The three-fifths clause,"" the historian George William Van Cleve writes in ""A Slaveholders' Union: Slavery, Politics, and the Constitution in the early American Republic,"" ""was the explicitly chosen political-security foundation for the constitutional bargain protecting the political economy of the slave states."" Even still, in its initial apportionment of the House, the committee responsible gave the eight northern states a modest seven-seat advantage over the five southern states, 36 to 29. More important, as the historian Jack N. Rakove explains in ""Original Meanings: Politics and Ideas in the Making of the Constitution,"" the committee left reapportionment up to the discretion of Congress. ""The Atlantic States having the government in their own hands, may take care of their own interest,"" explained Nathaniel Gorham of Massachusetts, ""by dealing out the right of Representation in safe proportions to the Western States."" This was a problem for the Southerners, who were already unhappy with their initial minority status in the Legislature. Discretionary reapportionment gave the northern majority control over the political future of the region. As I said earlier, there was broad expectation of rapid growth in the South and its western lands, including among enslaved people. Would a northern majority account for slave growth in its reapportionment? Would it give equal political representation to the migrants of the Southwest? Or would it entrench itself against demographic change? ""Those who have power in their hands,"" warned George Mason of Virginia, ""will not give it up while they can retain it."" The solution was to take reapportionment out of the hands of Congress. ""According to the present population of America,"" Mason declared, ""the northern part of it had a right to preponderate, and he could not deny it. But he wished it not to preponderate hereafter when the reason no longer continued."" Northern delegates resisted, but they lost. ""The apportionment of representatives in the future,"" Klarman writes, ""would be based on a census, which the Constitution would require Congress to undertake within three years of its first meeting and then again once every decade."" And slaves would be counted on the same three-fifths basis as they were for the initial apportionment of the House. To assuage a northern public that might object to representation for enslaved people, a Pennsylvania delegate, Gouverneur Morris, proposed a clause to tie representation to taxation, which had not yet been under discussion. Instead of saying outright that enslaved people would count for representation, they would link representation to ""direct taxes"" (which no delegate expected the federal government to ever impose) and link that to a population that included slaves. ""The delegates could pretend that they were not doing what they were actually doing,"" the historian Robin L. Einhorn explains in ""American Taxation, American Slavery."" She quotes delegate James Wilson of Pennsylvania making this exact point: ""Less umbrage would perhaps be taken"" against ""an admission of the slaves into the rule of representation, if it should be so expressed as to make them indirectly only an ingredient in the rule, by saying they should enter into the rule of taxation: and as representation was to be according to taxation, the end would be equally attained.""

In other words, as with so much of the Constitution of 1787, the census is wrapped up in slavery as an institution of significant political and economic influence. And the slaveholder gambit worked, for a time. As slavery grew to new heights in the first decades of the 19th century, mandatory reapportionment gave greater influence to the slaveholding South, providing it with a strong grip on the federal government. But what no one at the time of the founding could have anticipated was mass immigration to the Northern states and its territories. Millions of immigrants -- the bulk arriving from Germany, Ireland and Britain -- reached American shores between 1830 and 1860. Rather than settle in the South to compete with enslaved Africans, they remained in the North, moving to cities like New York and Boston or going west to states like Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Wisconsin. These immigrants changed the face of American politics. Germans, in particular, would play a significant role in the mass antislavery politics of the 1850s. ""German emigres joined existing radical movements, the labor movement, land reform, and abolition while others became free soilers,"" the historian Manisha Sinha writes in ""The Slave's Cause: A History of Abolition."" German refugees from the failed revolutions of 1848 ""formed alliances with abolitionists and brought a substantial section of the German immigrant population into the Republican Party."" And the census, of course, helped ensure that these demographic and cultural and ideological changes would make their way into Congress. The decade before the Civil War saw an influx of antislavery congressmen into the House of Representatives, first as Free Soilers, then as Republicans. Indeed, it is the rise of a popular antislavery politics that sets up the legislative confrontations and political realignments of the 1850s that culminated in the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860. The census is completely unassuming. Almost no one outside of politicians, bureaucrats and the professionally interested thinks about it, or about reapportionment. But these provisions are quietly powerful parts of our constitutional order. Their creation, Van Cleve notes, meant acceptance of the idea that the political majority ""should be continuously represented in government, no matter where that majority was found within the nation's expanding boundaries."" It meant that no existing political majority could ever fully insulate itself from the winds of change. Southern slaveholders were, among the delegates to Philadelphia, the least committed to popular government. South Carolina, to use one example, would be a planter oligarchy until after the Civil War. But in their drive to protect their political and economic interests, they introduced a mechanism for population representation that eventually helped fuel the forces of abolition. None of this was inevitable, and it was certainly unintended. If there is a greater lesson here, it has everything to do with chance and circumstance and the contingency of human affairs. It's a reminder that in the political realm there are no final victories or permanent defeats. At a time when just such dreams and fears are pushing our politics to dangerous places, this is very much something worth remembering.",But history has a way of confounding those who think they can control it.,7983021e-637c-51aa-aa3d-03fe385ac5f0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/08/opinion/08bouie_print/07bouieWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=7d6d30269258e241f0bf227b3d4d4242d998d4225689b29831bcac051d70a746&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Demonstrators protested the proposed addition of a citizenship question to the 2020 census in 2019.,7983021e-637c-51aa-aa3d-03fe385ac5f0,N24News/imgs/7983021e-637c-51aa-aa3d-03fe385ac5f0.jpg,11
Global Business,Europe Gets Ready for Round 2 of Bank Loans,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/27/business/global/27iht-ecb27.html,"FRANKFURT -- Central bankers do not like anyone to see them sweat, much less panic. But last November the temperature was clearly rising inside the battleship-gray office tower in downtown Frankfurt that houses the European Central Bank. European commercial banks were unable to raise money to lend to customers. Borrowing costs for Spain, Italy and Portugal were threatening to spin out of control, and Greece's had risen to levels that would make a loan shark blush. Analysts were issuing reports predicting that Greece would leave the euro zone -- if the currency union was lucky. The worst case was that the euro would disintegrate. ""The situation was deteriorating,"" recalled one policy maker, who did not want to be named because internal central bank discussions are confidential. ""Something had to be done."" In the weeks that followed, the central bank's governing council and its new president, Mario Draghi, succeeded in defusing the tension with a monetary policy tool that they will deploy again this week: unlimited three-year loans to commercial banks at the rock-bottom interest rate of 1 percent.

The move had a more striking effect than most outsiders expected, and turned Mr. Draghi into something of a hero just weeks after he took office. In fact, according to several people with direct knowledge of events, the option had been discussed internally for months. Mr. Draghi threw his weight behind the move, but the perception that he oversaw a radical shift in policy may be misleading. When Mr. Draghi succeeded Jean-Claude Trichet at the beginning of November, an exhaustive analysis of the possible consequences of longer-term loans to banks, conducted by economists and analysts at the European Central Bank and at national central banks, was well under way. This week the bank will offer a second installment of the three-year loans. After the first injection of cash helped reopen bank financing markets in Europe and bolster stock and bond markets around the world, there is intense interest in how much money banks will borrow, and what the effect will be. A few analysts say borrowing could approach 1 trillion euros, a significant amount, but the majority expect about half that, in line with the first round of three-year loans. One unknown is how much healthy banks will draw on the central bank's credit in order to make a profit by borrowing money at 1 percent and investing in assets that pay a higher return, like government bonds. The bank will announce the results Wednesday morning.

""We would fear that a very high number would not be very positive for the market,"" Padhraic Garvey, a debt strategist at ING Bank in Amsterdam, said during a conference call with clients last week. The three-year loans are, at first glance, little more than a tweak to existing policy. The central bank has been offering loans to banks on easier terms since the dawn of the financial crisis in spring 2008. After the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, it removed limits on how much banks could borrow. Provided they could supply collateral, banks could have as much money as they wanted. But the maximum term of the loans was about a year. The bank also cut its benchmark interest rate from 4.25 percent before the collapse of Lehman to 1 percent now. No one seems to remember who inside the European central banking world first suggested the idea of tripling the maximum term of loans to three years. By some accounts, the idea originated with someone at the Bank of France, but that is not certain. By October at the latest, and probably earlier, the idea of three-year loans was being debated by staff members of the European Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee and its Market Operations Committee. Both panels include representatives of the 17 national central banks in the euro zone, as well as the central bank. Meeting sometimes in person and, as the crisis intensified, almost daily by teleconference, members of the panels studied what would happen if the European Central Bank let banks borrow money for such an unprecedented period. There were huge risks. Almost by definition, the banks most in need of central bank money would be the weakest institutions, those that were mistrusted by their peers and cut off from interbank money markets. The central bank's rules say it can lend only to solvent institutions. But differentiating terminally ill banks from ones that are merely struggling is not an exact science. At the same time, there were some doubts whether three-year loans would make much difference. Banks could already borrow unlimited amounts for a year, and roll those loans over when they expired. Would three-year loans really be a powerful enough measure to restore market confidence?

Some economists and political leaders were clamoring for the European Central Bank to throw away its rulebook and buy government bonds wholesale. Within the bank, some more radical solutions were bandied about. The bank had been buying relatively modest amounts of euro area government bonds since May 2010 to try to keep prices in check, but that was no longer having much effect. The conservative German Bundesbank and its president, Jens Weidmann, were implacably opposed to emulating the Federal Reserve and its large purchases of securities. The three-year loans offered a compromise. There was a good chance that banks would use the money to buy government bonds, helping to keep borrowing costs for Italy, Spain and other countries under control.

Meanwhile, market pressure was intensifying. The central bank's staff members were in constant contact with banks and brokers, both informally and by way of the so-called Money Market Contact Group, made up of representatives of big banks like UniCredit, Deutsche Bank or BNP Paribas. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase were also represented. The picture they painted was bleak. Many banks were unable to sell their own corporate bonds on the open market, one of the main ways they raise money to lend to business and consumers. Yet in early 2012 they would need to roll over hundreds of billions of euros in bonds that were maturing. Some banks would fail if they could not raise new money. Others would have to severely curtail lending, causing a recession and a surge in unemployment. Much of the debate took place among staff members below the level of the governing council, which includes the heads of the 17 national central banks. But the staff people were in close touch with top central bankers, and their work helped build a consensus in favor of going ahead with the three-year loans. Some in Germany's Bundesbank, with its deep-seated concern about inflation, argued that the loans should be offered at a higher rate than the benchmark rate, which was lowered to 1 percent on Dec. 8 from 1.5 percent earlier in the year. But that view did not prevail, and when the matter came to the governing council for consideration, also on Dec. 8, the decision in favor was unanimous.

On Dec. 21, banks submitted their requests for funds to their national central banks, typically by means of a simple electronic form. In a few smaller countries the requests might be submitted by fax. Then the total amount was fed to the market operations room, an open-plan office on a lower floor of the central bank's building in Frankfurt where employees scrutinized multiple data terminals. Until the last minute, at least some people within the central bank doubted whether the offer would resonate with banks. But as the data rolled in to the market operations room, it was clear that it had: 523 banks, mostly from troubled countries like Greece, Spain and Italy but also many from France and a few from other countries, borrowed 489 billion euros, due on Jan. 29, 2015. It was only then that most outside analysts and investors grasped the significance of the move. Along with changes of government in Italy and Greece and better cooperation by European leaders, the loans lowered money market interest rates and allowed stronger banks to begin selling their bonds again to raise money. The loans ensured that banks would have enough cash to keep operating for three years, and offered markets what they crave most: certainty. Bond markets also recovered, with yields on Italian bonds falling from a dangerously high level of more than 7 percent in November to about 5.5 percent on Friday. Apparently some banks are using the cheap money to buy government debt. But even the central bank is not sure how banks are spending the money. Policy makers hope that they will lend it to businesses and consumers to help the European economy. There is a risk, though, that banks will hoard the money, or squander it on risky investments. Mr. Draghi maintained that he knew all along what a big deal the three-year loans would be. ""Maybe I should have called the tender 'Big Bertha' when I announced it,"" Mr. Draghi said last week in an interview with the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, a German newspaper. ""Then everyone would have listened.""",Analysts are watching with interest this week's reoffering of three-year loans at a rock-bottom interest rate.,a648022c-d00b-54ca-a163-90b523102b9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/02/27/business/27-ECB-jmp1/27-ECB-jmp1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=383&w=600&s=86492a2c2c50cce430ba2275be70e41f4dee14f22a87644b37d04171142630cb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The European Central Bank's offer of attractive loans to commercial banks was a compromise with conservative financial leaders.,a648022c-d00b-54ca-a163-90b523102b9c,N24News/imgs/a648022c-d00b-54ca-a163-90b523102b9c.jpg,24
Opinion,I Never Planned to Be a Front-Line Worker at Dollar General,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/26/opinion/covid-workers-dollar-general.html,"ALEXANDRIA, La. -- I've been working at Dollar General here for more than two years. My manager is wonderful, and I have a great relationship with my customers. But when I took this job I never planned to become a worker on the front line of a pandemic. I close the register many nights, so I know my store's revenue has practically doubled since the coronavirus hit. But we workers haven't gotten any extra money, even though we're risking our health, and our families' health, to keep the stores running. Louisiana's governor is expected to lift parts of the stay-at-home order soon. I don't think our state is ready for that and I know my co-workers aren't. We often work alone because of bare-bones staffing. I'm a full-time worker and on a typical day, I work from 1 p.m. to 9 p.m., and for the first three hours of my shift I'm by myself. When my relief shows up at 4, I often can't take lunch right away because the line is around the corner. I often have to pause the checkout line to run outside and grab ice or propane, or help a customer retrieve a product from one of the top shelves, then reopen the register.

But now it's a lot more dangerous to work alone. Retail workers have always faced high risks of workplace violence. Before I started my job here, one of my co-workers was robbed at gunpoint. I'm afraid we'll become more of a target for robberies because everyone knows we don't have any security and people are getting desperate. The unemployment office is overwhelmed, so a lot of people haven't gotten any relief yet.

And of course, I'm afraid to catch the coronavirus. More than 300 customers come in each day. I'm constantly reminding people to stay six feet apart, but there's no way to limit the number of people in the store, especially when I'm the only person working. We've always had a lot of homeless customers and I make sure to treat them with respect. But it's scary to have so many people in close quarters who can't take care of basic hygiene, especially since we don't have enough protective equipment. We receive small shipments of gloves every couple of weeks, but always run out within a few days. We didn't receive any masks until mid-April. There are no plexiglass barriers around the registers. When someone coughs, I joke with them -- ""We have a strict one-cough-per-customer limit!"" -- to let them know I'm watching and they need to keep their distance. But I'm on edge throughout my shift. I was bringing my own mask to work with me, and I got a sinus infection. But I didn't want to call out, because I don't have any paid sick leave; and 92 percent of surveyed Dollar General workers believe they don't either. Recently the company, which owns many of the dollar stores in the state, announced that we can take paid time off if we contract the coronavirus, but we still can't get tested, so I don't know how much that's worth. Now that my 4-year-old daughter Harmony's school is closed, I have to quickly line up child care when I get my work schedule. My manager posts the schedule in advance, but it changes often, so I always have to check it. My better half has worked the same job for 10 years and our family counts on that income. Since he works nights, I try to make sure he gets enough rest during the day. It would be great to work only when he can take care of Harmony, but I was hired with ""open availability"" which means I have to be ready for any shift. If I tried to limit my availability now, my hours would probably be cut in half and we can't afford that.

Like many parents in retail with unpredictable work hours, we rely on close friends and family members to watch Harmony while I'm at work. Harmony's aunt, my cousin, my sister and even my hairdresser all pitch in. But I try not to ask anyone to watch her more than once or twice a week. Several of them have their own children, and Harmony is on the autism spectrum so she has special needs; she's still potty training and her language skills aren't as developed, so that can make it more difficult to care for her. For all of this stress, Dollar General is planning to give me a one-time bonus of $300, which will be much less after taxes. Part-time workers will only get half of that. A one-time bonus is insulting when I still make just $10.75 an hour, and some of my part-time co-workers just $9 or $8 per hour. The company's chief executive, Todd Vasos, earns more than $10 million a year. The bonus doesn't even compensate me for the time I spend cleaning myself and my clothes after work so I don't get my family sick. It doesn't come close to fair compensation for the risks we're taking. And we can't count on stable hours or income, even though dollar stores are incredibly busy right now. As lead sales associate, I'm officially full time but I'm not guaranteed any hours. My manager tries to make sure I get at least 32 hours each week, but some weeks I work just 29 hours. Things can't go on like this. We deserve hazard pay and better scheduling. We deserve to be taken care of just like we do for our customers.

Fashion & Style,"Despite Turkish Strife, Fashion Brands Stay True to Istanbul",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/fashion/turkey-fashion-despite-troubles-brands-remain-loyal-to-istanbul.html,"LONDON -- In 2015, Sama Danesh, a former computer engineer in London with long-held dreams of setting up a luxury swimwear line, finally found her ideal manufacturing partner after searching fruitlessly from Italy to Portugal, Morocco to France: a factory in Istanbul. ""I knew that Turkey was a major manufacturing base for big fashion brands, but I hadn't thought it could work for a small start-up,"" she said in a telephone interview last week. ""Fairly quickly, I found a factory on the outskirts of the city that seemed perfect. I put my life into storage and moved to Istanbul straight away."" During her early months in Turkey, Ms. Danesh said, she was ""blown away"" by the workers' craftsmanship and focus on detail, particularly when it came to pattern-cutting and the construction -- using sculptured fabric, wiring and boning -- needed to create the silhouettes for her swimsuits, which sell for about $385. She explored the vibrant fashion and arts scene, finding inspiration among Istanbul's famed bazaars and young, homegrown labels. In the summer of 2016, as her collection moved into the production stage and she began to receive orders, she returned to London. She was on the verge of success. Then, she said, ""the climate totally changed.""

In recent years, homegrown and foreign brands have flocked to establish themselves in Istanbul, lending it a reputation as Europe's fourth fashion city. But Turkey, a country that physically and culturally straddles East and West, is in the midst of one of the most volatile periods in its recent history. The country has been grappling with a spate of terror attacks targeting both Turks and tourists, the fallout from the ongoing war in Syria, just over the border, a shuddering economic slowdown and a failed military coup last July that resulted in the government of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan declaring a state of emergency. The state of emergency has since stifled most forms of legitimate opposition, triggering a wave of protests and mass rallies like that organized by the opposition Republican People's Party, attended by a million people in Istanbul last month. Day-to-day life goes on for millions of Turks. Still, tourist numbers are down, the Turkish lira has slumped and local consumer confidence has declined, putting considerable pressure on Istanbul's blossoming creative scene and its many small fashion brands. Although Turkey's textile, leather and clothing production has been in place for centuries, designing has not. Long a manufacturing center for mass-market retailers like Marks & Spencer and Inditex, as well as luxury labels like Burberry and Hugo Boss, the city has become a hub for the fast-growing Modest Fashion Movement geared to style-conscious Islamic women. It is also home to a slew of designers with a Western aesthetic, many of whom have expanded their businesses internationally. And for fledgling foreign brands operating or manufacturing in Turkey, the new status quo in the country has been more than unsettling.

""It has been a nightmare,"" Ms. Danesh said. After the coup, everything from Dropbox to PayPal ceased to function efficiently. There were delivery delays. ""The factory kept telling me that everything was fine on the phone, but I could tell it was not,"" she said. By this time, she had signed deals to sell her stock at Harvey Nichols in London and to boutiques Dubai and the Spanish island of Ibiza. Many pieces in Ms. Danesh's initial 2017 summer collection were so delayed they had to be released as part of her subsequent cruise collection. ""I still use the Istanbul factory because of the product quality,"" she said. ""But I have moved shipping to Britain, which eats into margins but has also reduced the risk that I don't deliver orders in time."" Despite the troubles, some fledgling brands with design studios in Istanbul remain upbeat. Manu Atelier is a small, family-run accessories label housed in an 18th-century building on a cobbled street in the Beyoglu district, an ancient quarter known for its leatherwork trade. Founded in 2014 by Merve and Beste Manastir, daughters of a leather craftsman who personally signs off on every piece, the company has grown rapidly in the last three years thanks to savvy use of social media, competitive prices and glowing endorsements by Vogue and Eva Chen of Instagram. The label is stocked at Selfridges and Saks and now has an office staff of 16 and a workshop of 30 artisans. ""It has been a chaotic time,"" Merve Manastir said. ""Locally, people have been less keen to go out and spend money, and visitor numbers are down. But honestly, we don't think about borders that much. Our business has grown so much internationally that we are less exposed in our home market.

That sentiment is shared by Ece and Ayse Ege, also sisters, who set up their couture and ready-to-wear label Dice Kayek in 1992, and celebrated their 25th anniversary in business this year. Although they split their time between Paris and Istanbul, their atelier has always been in the heart of their home city. ""Emotionally, Dice Kayek feels Parisian, but our craftsmanship is entirely rooted here,"" Ece Ege said. ""That has actually helped us in the last two years. Since we're in Turkey and can supply all of the raw materials and produce everything here, we've been able to keep the costs down despite the devaluation of the lira,"" she said. ""It has actually become cheaper to make our garments, which we can then sell on in euros."" She added that the company was more vulnerable to the volatility within the broader fashion industry than that of the Turkish political situation. Whatever happened, she said, they will never take their manufacturing operations elsewhere. Enis Karavil is the creative director of Sanayi 313, a concept boutique that opened in 2015 in an industrial estate in the northeastern part of Istanbul with the hope of creating a lifestyle destination for those with a passion for modern design, fashion, art and food. A shoes and accessories label of the same name is now sold in stores like Bergdorf Goodman in New York and at Net-a-Porter, and there are plans to open a boutique hotel near the Blue Mosque. An interior architect by training, Mr. Karavil remains optimistic about the future of luxury within Turkey, once a bright spot for growth in the industry. ""Five years ago Istanbul was in the midst of a real moment,"" he said. ""Some of that appetite has since died away, although the rapid growth of Sanayi 313 would suggest that shoppers are interested in what is emerging from the local scene. I have no doubt that the situation will improve.","Turkey is in a state of turmoil, but many small fashion and lifestyle businesses remain upbeat and resilient in the face of uncertainty and unrest.",5165b769-c77c-583d-b385-80ec2479f5cc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/26/fashion/26turkey1-inyt/26turkey1-inyt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e5749e3012a65698f4e910a6d0313f9afb0aa2e7cccd5c8c05c5a19080a71019&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The sisters Beste, left, and Merve Manastir of Manu Atelier.",5165b769-c77c-583d-b385-80ec2479f5cc,N24News/imgs/5165b769-c77c-583d-b385-80ec2479f5cc.jpg,19
Health,Final Salvos Against Polio,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/09/health/pakistan-polio-every-last-child-documentary.html,"Children playing in Karachi, Pakistan, one of the few places where polio can still be found.

The documentary ""Every Last Child"" begins the way ""Hill Street Blues"" used to: A police commander says a few words to his men before they roll out into a hostile city. Their job is to protect polio teams going house to house in neighborhoods where Taliban assassins cruise on motorbikes. It is their jihad, he tells them. Everyone in ""Every Last Child"" is fighting a holy war -- the vaccinators against the virus, the Taliban against the vaccinators, the police against the Taliban. Above them, outside the frame, is a dark tornado of greater forces: radical Islam versus those it considers Crusaders, the Central Intelligence Agency's actions versus those of the World Health Organization, Western science versus Eastern faith. Every time it touches down in the slums of Karachi and Peshawar, it leaves behind new victims: dead vaccinators and paralyzed children. If polio has disappeared from Africa -- and on Aug. 11, it will be a full year since a case has been found on that continent -- then the Pakistan-Afghanistan strain will be the world's last. The documentary, which opened in New York on Wednesday and will play five cities this month, surveys what appears to be the last battlefield in the fight to eliminate polio.

It conveys the splendor and terror in ways that print reportage never can: The jewelry strung across a mother's hairline jangling as she argues against giving drops to her child. The oiled snap of a clip locked into an AK-47 by a nervous cop. The flow of filthy water past the lens of a camera submerged in an open sewer. The urgent sotto voce of a W.H.O. consultant whispering facts into the ear of a Pakistani politician just before he announces a fresh campaign round. Still, the film struggles to explain the core of the crisis. Why would anyone decline a gift with no strings attached -- a gift that, rejected, could consign one's own children to paralysis? Even worse: Who would ruthlessly gun down women and girls -- neighbors and clansmen, not strangers -- who are the innocent bearers of that gift? The film offers hints. In it, Zubair Rabi, a grocer, and his friends repeat the tired but still potent rumors: That the vaccine is really birth control aimed at Muslims. That the same American skunk works brewed up the virus that causes AIDS and shipped it to Africa. The camera follows Mr. Rabi and his children to the beach. It is empathetic: He obviously loves them. No, he says, as they play fully clothed in the surf, they are not vaccinated, but they are healthy. He loves God, so God protects his bairns.

Left unexplained is why this blind rejection stays nailed solidly into a few tiny pockets of the Islamic world while the vast majority of Muslims accept the vaccine -- along with others, and antibiotics, drugs for AIDS and hepatitis C, cancer chemotherapy and other Western formulations, all of them more toxic than polio drops. As polio has been driven back into its last redoubts, it has become more and more a disease of the aggrieved minority, of people so beaten down that they trust nothing offered by outsiders -- and for whom almost everyone is an outsider. With the departure of the U.S. military on Aug. 30, Afghanistan quickly fell back under control of the Taliban. Across the country, there is widespread anxiety about the future.
* None
* Vanishing Rights: The Taliban's decision to restrict women's freedom may be a political choice as much as it is a matter of ideology.
* Far From Home: Some Afghans who were abroad when the country collapsed are desperate to return, but have no clear route home.
* Can Afghan Art Survive? The Taliban have not banned art outright. But many artists have fled, fearing for their work and their lives.
* A Growing Threat: A local affiliate of the Islamic State group is upending security and putting the Taliban government in a precarious position. That is not uncommon. In West Africa, Ebola first broke out among the rural Kissi people who live where Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea meet. They feel despised by the elites of the capital cities, descendants of freed slaves, and were so sure that the elites had sent Ebola that they attacked medical teams venturing in to help them. For a decade, polio has been essentially a Muslim disease. The 2005 hajj season spread a Nigerian strain to Mecca and out from there. Most Muslim countries clamped down hard. Saudi Arabia, for example, vaccinates pilgrims on arrival. Now the virus hits almost only Pakistanis and Afghans -- and not all of them, but nearly only Pashtuns, the tribe originally from the mountainous border. And not even all Pashtuns, but mostly the Mehsuds and a few other conservative clans. They are the people who fought the British at the Khyber Pass, the mujahedeen who fought the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and the source of the Taliban. Empires have overrun their villages and butchered them but have never subsumed their culture, or even pacified their clan fighters for long. They have or had kindred spirits around the world: in the Scottish highlands, in Appalachia, in Sicily, in the mountains of Vietnam and Myanmar.","The film ""Every Last Child,"" which opened in New York on Wednesday, documents vaccinators' struggle for survival against the Taliban.",b25ac6f1-5f47-51fa-863b-10a212e6ecd4,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/09/science/09POLIO/09POLIO-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=a95557d5ee9e32d0c8235fbcd6f090ae7cf9c051b9a0ee54f4af344f3e446603&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"­Children playing in Karachi, Pakistan, one of the few places where polio can still be found.",b25ac6f1-5f47-51fa-863b-10a212e6ecd4,N24News/imgs/b25ac6f1-5f47-51fa-863b-10a212e6ecd4.jpg,1
Sports,Big Ten Changes Rules to Let Ohio State Play for Conference Championship,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/09/sports/big-ten-rule-change-ohio-state-conference-championship.html,"The Big Ten, faced with the possibility of being shut out of the College Football Playoff -- and the $6 million plus payday that comes with it -- rewrote its rules on Wednesday so that Ohio State could be placed in its conference championship game despite playing just five games this season.

The Buckeyes, 5-0 and ranked fourth, were faced with the prospect of not meeting the six-game threshold to qualify for the Big Ten title game on Dec. 19 after Michigan on Tuesday canceled this weekend's rivalry game between the teams because of a coronavirus outbreak within the program.

Now, after the conference's Administrators Council, which includes athletic directors and senior women administrators, changed the rules and eliminated a minimum-game restriction, Ohio State will face No. 14 Northwestern in Indianapolis for the conference title. The Buckeyes will also have a competitive advantage for that game, with an effective bye this week after the Michigan cancellation, while Northwestern plays Illinois on Saturday.

The conference said in a statement that the decision was based on ""a competitive analysis,"" because even if Ohio State had lost to Michigan it would have still finished ahead of Indiana, the second-place team in the conference, whose one loss in seven games came to Ohio State, 42-35, on Nov. 21.",The shift is yet another example of college football changing its rules on the fly during the pandemic.,c7e15bef-4232-5177-96a8-6f191dd09604,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/12/09/sports/09bigten/merlin_180849726_414450a4-15a2-438e-9948-e0bc55f28cc9-facebookJumbo.jpg,"After the rule change, fourth-ranked Ohio State will face No. 14 Northwestern in 10 days for the Big Ten championship.",c7e15bef-4232-5177-96a8-6f191dd09604,N24News/imgs/c7e15bef-4232-5177-96a8-6f191dd09604.jpg,9

Media,"At The Ringer, Staff Writers Say They Are Second-String",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/media/the-ringer-union-bill-simmons.html,"The head coach of the Golden State Warriors. A former ace of the New York Yankees. A onetime star of ""The Bachelorette."" Steve Kerr, C. C. Sabathia and Rachel Lindsay were among the roughly 25 outside contributors to host or co-host new podcasts this year at The Ringer, the digital media company founded and run by the former ESPN personality Bill Simmons. The influx of celebrity talent being brought on as contractors has raised concerns among many full-time employees, who say it may close off their opportunities for advancement and weaken the company's union.

Months before the Spotify deal, employees formed The Ringer Union, which is affiliated with the Writers Guild of America, East, and has about 65 members. Ringer management quickly recognized the union, but negotiations toward a collective bargaining agreement have stalled, and the company's move toward outside contributors has been a sticking point. Last month two Ringer employees with large followings -- Jason Concepcion and Haley O'Shaughnessy -- announced they were leaving. Several Ringer employees, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe internal matters, said that Mr. Concepcion and Ms. O'Shaughnessy had decided to leave after pay disputes. Mr. Concepcion declined to comment; Ms. O'Shaughnessy did not respond to requests for comment. Mr. Concepcion, who had co-hosted a pop culture podcast and served as the main host of an Emmy-winning video program, left for Crooked Media, a podcasting company founded by Obama White House alumni. Ms. O'Shaughnessy, who had written on sports and appeared on The Ringer's basketball podcasts, has joined Blue Wire, a sports podcasting network, where she plans to have an N.B.A. podcast. The departure of the two homegrown stars, along with the arrival of high-profile outsiders, underscored concerns among many staff members that Mr. Simmons favored an approach that would allow him to produce a significant amount of content with contractors, who are not eligible for the union.

Ringer employees say Mr. Simmons showed signs of trying to marginalize the union dating back to when it was formed last year. Kate Knibbs, a staff writer who left for Wired in December, said that Mr. Simmons unfollowed her on Twitter after she indicated her support for the union and that he stopped promoting her work on Twitter. Three other Ringer employees at the time, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they feared retaliation, said Mr. Simmons unfollowed them after they expressed support for the union as well.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. The employees said the move was damaging to them because Mr. Simmons's Twitter account, with its millions of followers, was a significant source of web traffic. Mr. Simmons declined to comment. Around the same time, Mr. Simmons hired Ryen Russillo, a former ESPN colleague, to host a podcast. The union sought to include Mr. Russillo but management resisted, and the union eventually agreed to leave him out. Since that dispute, high-profile podcast hosts have joined The Ringer as contractors, who are ineligible to become union members, rather than as employees. Four staff writers started at The Ringer this year, and several staff writers have received podcasting opportunities. Still, outside contractors have joined the company at a faster rate than employees, who complain that it is difficult to move up within the organization. During negotiations, the union has made proposals that would limit the use of contractors and create a transparent system allowing staff writers to earn promotions based on seniority or achievements.

Travel,Wandering the Wonders of Oregon,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/30/travel/wandering-the-wonders-of-oregon.html,"When Travel Oregon, the state's tourism commission, introduced its Seven Wonders of Oregon campaign last March, it was supposed to be a five-month-long initiative focused on a few key regional markets.

More than a year later, the campaign is still alive and has gone global, thanks in part to a flashy website, a smart tie-in to the film ""Wild,"" most of which was filmed in Oregon, and the simple fact that travelers love lists of beautiful places. Linea Gagliano, a spokeswoman for Travel Oregon, says that the campaign contributed to nearly 10 percent growth in statewide lodging revenue in 2014 over 2013, an increase of more than 120,000 social media followers, and a record number of unique visitors to its website.

On Tuesday, Ron Wyden, the senior U.S. Senator from Oregon, will embark on a seven-day trip visiting each of the seven natural wonders -- Crater Lake National Park, Mt. Hood, Smith Rock State Park, the Painted Hills, the Wallowa Mountains, the Columbia River Gorge and the Oregon Coast. His barnstorming tour encompasses a little more than 1,000 miles and will include ""listening sessions,"" rather than the fun stuff that Oregon is known for -- outdoor sports, wine and beer tasting, and unspoiled beaches among other things.

Given that these seven wonders are scattered around a big state that is long on scenery but somewhat short on Interstates and airports, does it make sense to try to hit them all in one trip? Ms. Gagliano said that it is absolutely feasible to experience all seven sights on one trip. She suggested flying into and out of Portland and making a loop: south along the Oregon Coast, then cut inland at Reedsport to Crater Lake National Park, the deepest lake in North America and surely one of the most scenic. Then head north to Bend and continue on to Smith Rock State Park -- towers of volcanic rock that represent some of the best climbing and hiking in the state -- before heading east to take in the Painted Hills and the Wallowas in eastern Oregon.",A state tourism campaign promotes Oregon destinations from Crater Lake National Park to the Columbia River Gorge; here's how to see them.,4996820d-b9ae-5f28-8b2d-6b953751770a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/30/travel/30intransitphoto-oregon/30intransitphoto-oregon-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=331&w=632&s=99d2d2729eb8805f81a06e4781a8f691a174a152d7e72912cc32f218cefba96d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Columbia River Gorge.,4996820d-b9ae-5f28-8b2d-6b953751770a,N24News/imgs/4996820d-b9ae-5f28-8b2d-6b953751770a.jpg,4
Books,Woody Allen's Memoir Is Published,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/books/woody-allen-apropos-of-nothing-autobiography-arcade.html,"Before it had even been released, Woody Allen's new autobiography, ""Apropos of Nothing,"" ignited a ferocious backlash. Employees of Hachette Book Group, the publishing company that originally acquired the book, staged a walkout in protest. With remarkable speed, Hachette, which had planned to release the book through its Grand Central imprint, canceled the publication and returned the rights to Mr. Allen. While some applauded Hachette's decision, others argued it amounted to censorship. Now, another company, Arcade Publishing, has snapped up the book and is releasing it on Monday, with a first print run of 75,000 copies. The publication of Mr. Allen's memoir, which was reported earlier by The Associated Press, comes at a challenging moment for the industry, which is struggling with the economic toll of the coronavirus outbreak, as bookstores across the country close. While it seemed inevitable that another publisher would eventually take on the project, it was surprising that Mr. Allen resold it so quickly, in such a dismal retail environment.

In his autobiography, Mr. Allen addresses some of the controversies surrounding his private life and behavior toward women, including his adopted daughter Dylan Farrow's abuse allegations against him. He also includes a postscript about the book's troubled path to publication, slamming Hachette for dropping him. ""Hachette read the book and loved it and despite me being a toxic pariah and menace to society, they vowed to stand firm should things hit the fan,"" he writes. ""When actual flak did arrive they thoughtfully reassessed their position, concluding that perhaps courage was not the virtue it was cracked up to be and there was a lot to be said for cowering."" He added that he was confident his book ""would land somewhere because you can't keep the truth bottled up forever."" In a statement announcing the publication, Arcade called the book ""a candid and comprehensive personal account by Woody Allen of his life, ranging from his childhood in Brooklyn through his acclaimed career in film, theater, television, print and standup comedy, as well as exploring his relationships with family and friends."" Jeannette Seaver, an editor who acquired the book, said that Arcade decided to publish the book not only on the merits of the material, but also on principle, to take a stand against Mr. Allen's critics.

""In this strange time, when truth is too often dismissed as 'fake news,' we as publishers prefer to give voice to a respected artist, rather than bow to those determined to silence him,"" she said in a statement. ""We firmly believe in upholding the right to freedom of speech in the world of publishing and, as a result, we're pleased to support not only this terrific book but also -- and even more importantly -- this democratic principle."" Arcade is an imprint of the independent publisher Skyhorse, a company that has been willing to court controversy in the past, with provocative authors like the attorney and commentator Alan Dershowitz, a frequent defender of Donald J. Trump, and the conspiracy theorist Jim Garrison. At a moment when publishers are increasingly wary of sparking controversy and driving a social media backlash, Arcade's decision to publish Mr. Allen caught some in the industry by surprise, particularly after Hachette's rapid about face. Grand Central had acquired the rights to Mr. Allen's autobiography in March 2019, but had only announced that fact earlier this month. The journalist Ronan Farrow, whose best-selling book ""Catch and Kill"" had been released by Little, Brown, another Hachette imprint, last year, quickly lashed out at the company, saying it had secretly planned to publish Mr. Allen's book behind his back, and that he would no longer work with the publisher. Mr. Farrow, whose reporting on accusations of sexual assault against Harvey Weinstein and other powerful men helped touch off the #MeToo movement, is Mr. Allen's son with the actress Mia Farrow. Mr. Farrow and his adopted sister, Dylan Farrow, have long accused Mr. Allen of molesting her when she was a child, allegations he has denied. Mr. Allen was not charged after two investigations. ""Your policy of editorial independence among your imprints does not relieve you of your moral and professional obligations as the publisher of 'Catch and Kill,' and as the leader of a company being asked to assist in efforts by abusive men to whitewash their crimes,"" Mr. Farrow wrote to Michael Pietsch, the chief executive of Hachette. Mr. Pietsch had defended the decision to publish Mr. Allen's book, but a staged walkout of more than 100 employees was part of the pressure that led to the reversal of the plan.

""The decision to cancel Mr. Allen's book was a difficult one,"" a spokeswoman for Hachette said in a statement at the time. ""We take our relationships with authors very seriously, and do not cancel books lightly. We have published and will continue to publish many challenging books. As publishers, we make sure every day in our work that different voices and conflicting points of views can be heard."" Mr. Allen, an Academy Award-winning filmmaker, has seen his legacy tarnished by the allegations about his daughter. An agent representing him had approached several publishers since late 2018 but was ""met with indifference or hard passes,"" The New York Times reported last year. In November, Mr. Allen and Amazon settled a breach of contract lawsuit after the company backed out of a multi-movie deal with Mr. Allen after #MeToo allegations from the 1990s resurfaced against him. Mr. Allen filed the suit against Amazon earlier last year. Following Hachette's announcement of the book's cancellation, Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive of the free-speech nonprofit PEN America, had called the situation ""something of a perfect storm."" This incident, she said in a statement, ""involved not just a controversial book, but a publisher that was working with individuals on both sides of a longstanding and traumatic familial rupture. This presented unique circumstances that clearly colored the positions staked out and decisions taken. If the end result here is that this book, regardless of its merits, disappears without a trace, readers will be denied the opportunity to read it and render their own judgments.""","Arcade Publishing released ""Apropos of Nothing"" on Monday.

Science,"In an English City, a Lesson in Climate Change",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/13/science/carlisle-england-climate-change-flooding.html,"CARLISLE, England -- After this ancient fortress city was hit by a crippling flood in 2005, its residents could take some comfort in the fact that it was the kind of deluge that was supposed to happen about once every 200 years. But it happened again four years later. And again last winter, when Storm Desmond brought record-breaking downpours that turned roads into rivers, fields into lakes, living rooms into ponds. ""I really felt like we were in danger of death,"" said Jonathan Bryant, who scrambled out of his car -- helping his wife, Diane, their two children and a cat -- after they were hit by a wall of water and had to wade a quarter-mile back to their house, through rushing torrents, pelting rain and 60-mile-per-hour wind in the pitch black. In many places, the threat of climate change can still feel distant, even theoretical. But not here, a city of about 74,000 in the far northwest corner of England, where one of its rivers swelled to about 30 times its normal volume last year.

About 2,000 houses and 500 businesses were damaged or destroyed in the flooding, and by July, thousands of people still were not able to return to their homes. Some of the city's schools were flooded, and one of the biggest employers here, a McVitie's biscuit factory, closed for four months after taking on, by one estimate, about 10 million gallons of water. Residents worry that the factory will close for good if it is flooded again. And their fears may not be misplaced.

Scientists have estimated that climate change has increased the chances of storms like Desmond by 40 percent in this part of Britain, though estimates are somewhat uncertain. ""What we had in Carlisle -- frequent series of storms and superstorms -- are exactly what you would expect in a globally warming climate,"" said Colin Thorne, a river scientist at the University of Nottingham. ""So we shouldn't be surprised that it happened."" ""Figuring out how to deal with storms and flooding cities is going to have to happen all over the world,"" he added. This working-class city is particularly vulnerable because it was rainy to begin with, and it also sits at the meeting of three rivers, with many homes built on flood plains. Carlisle has tried a number of solutions. After the 2005 floods, the government raised and extended flood walls, and in some places planted willow trees to slow the water flow and stabilize the banks. But now, dozens of residents, furious and discouraged with their circumstances, have banded together to wrest control of their flood defenses from the government. They recently proposed that a new independent authority of experts, residents and government officials manage the rivers and watershed area.

Government environmental officials said they understood the residents' frustration, but also contended that there was no way to eliminate every risk or protect against every flood. A major issue is cost. The national Environment Agency has allocated up to 25 million pounds, or about $33 million, for flood defenses in Carlisle, and PS43 million, or $58 million, for the county of Cumbria, out of about $919 million in emergency funding for all the areas affected by the recent flooding. Daniel Johns, the head of adaptation for the Committee on Climate Change, an independent British government advisory body, said spending on flood control was important, but not a solution. ""Flood defenses will only ever provide a limited and now diminishing standard of protection,"" Mr. Johns said. Some flood victims say they wonder if it makes sense to live in Carlisle anymore, given the relentless flooding. ""I don't want to go back,"" said Christine McBride, a longtime Carlisle resident who is living in a rented apartment while her home is being repaired. ""But I will be going back,"" she added. ""I have to."" She put her home on the market, but recently took it off because the flood risk made it a tough sell.

Ms. McBride's home was also flooded in 2005, she said, and she thought that government officials were being overly cautious when they told her to evacuate in December. When the water started bubbling into her home, her son urged her to leave. ""People who have not been flooded think it's nice to get all new things, but it's not, and I do not sleep properly always thinking what to sort out next,"" she said.

At a pub here, residents say they would like to get on with their lives, but are having trouble doing so. The pub, which reopened recently after flood repairs, is on Warwick Road, a street lined with large, yellow trash bins filled with tiles, insulation, mattresses, even refrigerators ruined in the flooding. The windows of homes vacated by flood victims are dusty and unlit. Blue ribbons had been tied six feet up the trunks of the street's stalwart oak trees, marking the high water level. Many displaced residents said they still felt depressed and discouraged about spending another night in a rental home. Several insurance companies sent some families to stay at the Crown & Mitre Hotel in the center of the city.","Carlisle, England, was flooded in 2005 and again four years later — and again in December.

Television,Netflix Renews 'One Day at a Time',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/arts/television/one-day-at-a-time-netflix-renews.html,"The ecstatically reviewed Netflix series ""One Day at a Time"" has been renewed for a third season.

The show may seem out of place with the current television landscape in many respects: It's an earnest multicamera comedy based off Norman Lear's 1975 sitcom. But it has built a rabid following online and in particular received strong support among Latinos. The show follows three generations of a Cuban-American family, which includes a divorced veteran with PTSD (Justina Machado), her widowed immigrant mother (Rita Moreno) and her lesbian teenage daughter (Isabella Gomez).

The second season arrived on Netflix in January, without an indication of whether it would get renewed again. The silence prompted organizations like the National Hispanic Media Coalition as well as critics at Vulture and The Hollywood Reporter to call for the show's renewal.

In her New York Times review, Margaret Lyons wrote that the show ""radiates delight"" and ""cultivates an intimacy and sense of belonging that goes a step further, introducing a level of genuine human happiness into the experience.""",The celebrated show follows three generations of Cuban-Americans through modern life.,6bb7f1d2-1377-5831-b27e-213c7c0f36a5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/26/arts/27oneday-item/oneday-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=cf4e946d6442a40953722fe760e2acd9279d337fda4227191dcf6ea28deec988&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ed Quinn and Justina Machado in ""One Day at a Time.""",6bb7f1d2-1377-5831-b27e-213c7c0f36a5,N24News/imgs/6bb7f1d2-1377-5831-b27e-213c7c0f36a5.jpg,3
Global Business,European Businesses Hit in Credit Squeeze From Greek Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/19/business/global/19iht-borrow.html,"When Tadeusz Nowicki visited his local bank in early May looking for credit to expand production at his profitable and fast-growing plastics processing company in Warsaw, Ergis-Eurofilms, he got a lecture instead. ""The banks are putting out the message that the high leverage times are over,"" Mr. Nowicki said. Never mind that Poland has one of the fastest-growing economies in the European Union, or that Ergis-Eurofilms increased profit last year by 70 percent, to 17 million zloty, or $5.2 million, in the midst of a global recession. The Greek debt crisis and its ripple effects across Europe are crimping credit, especially for midsize and smaller companies and especially those in countries perceived as riskier -- starting with Greece but also including Portugal, Spain and others on the periphery. That means the credit crunch could be most severe in the countries most in need of economic growth. In fact, the crisis is dividing up companies into credit-haves and credit-have-nots.

The haves include companies like SAP, the German maker of corporate software. In April, SAP issued EUR500 million, or $618 million, in corporate bonds with an interest rate of 2.5 percent, which compares favorably with German government bunds, the gold standard in the European debt market. The have-nots include companies like Vostex, a family-owned textile company with 10 employees located in the Athens suburb of Peristeri. ""The banks are getting stingy,"" griped Harry Vostantzoglou, chief executive of Vostex. He said that Vostex was profitable and that he expected it to survive even without the local banks. Still, he said he might postpone international expansion plans. As at Vostex, lack of credit can translate into reduced investment and job creation. If the crunch persists, it could slow European growth, hold down tax receipts and make it that much harder for such countries as Greece, Portugal and Spain to get their debts under control. European banks, still recovering from the financial crisis, had tightened their standards for borrowers even before sovereign debt jitters struck. Lending fell at an annual rate of more than 2 percent in the first quarter of 2010, according to European Central Bank data. Now there are signs the availability of credit to business could worsen further as banks and investors demand higher risk premiums. The situation is especially dire for companies in the highly indebted countries, where rates for business loans tend to reflect the risk premium that the local government is paying. Banks in Greece have also been hit hard by their government's debt crisis and the economic downturn, making it tougher for them to lend.

""There is no longer a single cost of capital for the euro zone as a whole,"" Stephen King, global chief economist at HSBC, wrote Monday in a note. ""It appears that nationality is increasingly having an impact on borrowing costs. So much for the single market"" in the zone. Corporate borrowing in the bond market is also in a sharp downturn. New bond issues by European companies plunged in April, to $28.5 billion from $58.3 billion in March, according to data from Dealogic. And so far in May, new issues have totaled about $5 billion. ""Greece's debt crisis could cause credit spreads to widen and borrowing costs to rise, prompting issuers to hold off raising funds until market conditions improve,"" Christine Li, European economist at Moody's, the ratings agency, wrote in a note. Credit spreads represent the difference in interest that borrowers need to pay on securities perceived as risky and those deemed safe. The bond market sometimes seems to be singling out companies in the most indebted countries. The cost of insuring bonds issued by Telefonica, the telecommunications provider based in Madrid, nearly doubled from mid-April to early May, even though the company earns two-thirds of its revenue outside Spain. ""The perception is that if Madrid is in trouble so is Telefonica,"" said Karsten Rosenkilde, a senior corporate bond fund manager at DWS, the fund management arm of Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt. ""The Mediterranean corporates were the first to suffer and have really struggled to recover."" It may not be fair, but that is often the way the lending market works. In many cases credit rating agencies follow a ""sovereign ceiling"" practice, under which private borrowers cannot obtain a better rating than their home country's debt, according to a 2006 study by economists at the Federal Reserve. After sovereign debt crises or defaults, the study found, credit tends to become more expensive for all domestic businesses, which then cut their borrowing.

The twist in this sovereign debt crisis is that risk premiums remain low in the European countries that investors perceive as safe. The Dutch brewer Heineken, for example, last week raised $725 million from institutional investors at 4.5 percent over eight years. It then swapped the debt into euros with an even lower interest rate of 3.9 percent. The effect of tighter credit on the overall economy is likely to be limited at first, at least among larger companies. In the past year, many took advantage of low interest rates to raise money. Cesar, a French company that supplies costumes, masks, and other children's gear to customers including Walt Disney, raised EUR5.5 million from private and institutional investors in a placement conducted in March, just before the worst of the European market turmoil. Cesar will use the money to expand the product range and gingerly pursue expansion in Europe, said Benoit Pousset, chief executive of the company. ""For 2010 we're conservative,"" Mr. Pousset said. ""There are still pockets of growth but we're realistic."" Hardest hit will probably be smaller companies in the Mediterranean countries that are reliant on local banks for credit. Companies in Eastern Europe, still recovering from a sharp downturn in 2008, may also suffer from increased risk aversion by banks. ""Banks are now much more cautious,"" said Thomas Laursen, the World Bank's country manager for Poland and the Baltic States. ""Financing conditions for the private sector are now much more difficult, and this has affected investments."" The European Central Bank has sought to keep credit flowing by allowing banks to borrow from it at 1 percent interest. As collateral the E.C.B. accepts bonds, even Greek bonds, allowing banks to convert this damaged debt to cash.

The E.C.B. president Jean-Claude Trichet often reminds banks that he expects them to lend this cheap money to businesses to fuel growth. In fact, some companies are still getting credit despite the sovereign debt crisis. For example, Sonae, a developer of shopping centers and the largest private employer in Portugal, said it still planned to open 45 stores in Spain this year despite a slump in consumer spending. ""Credit is not so easy to get as it was in the past,"" the company said in a statement in answer to questions. ""However, Sonae isn't having problems in financing its activities."" Over all, though, a climate of tighter credit would seem to favor companies in Germany, France or other countries that still enjoy the trust of bond buyers. John Leahy, chief commercial officer for Airbus, the plane maker based in France, said that financing for new aircraft deliveries has not been affected so far by the market swoon. ""So far, so good,"" he said. ""We're not seeing any real problems."" Mr. Rosenkilde, the fund manager at DWS, predicted that the corporate bond market could bounce back quickly if investors became more confident about Europe's ability to overcome the sovereign debt crisis. A more robust bond market would also be encouraging news for small-business lending. Banks often issue bonds to raise money that they then lend to companies. Martin Fischedick, a member of the board of the Corporate Banking division of Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said that ""conditions on the money and bond markets play an important role in the ability of banks to lend to companies."" At the beginning of May ""there were severe tensions in these markets because of the E.U. debt crisis,"" Mr. Fischedick said in an e-mail message. But he said a $1 trillion rescue package eased the tensions and bank lending was not affected. Until the credit rebound comes, Mr. Nowicki, the Warsaw plastics maker, said he would have to curtail investment. Banks, he said, ""can see our company's performance, how we repay on time."" But he added: ""I am suffering. I have three or four projects ready but I cannot realize them because of limited access to loans. The banks don't want to deliver.""",Midsize and smaller companies in Greece but also in Portugal and Spain are particularly suffering.,2e007070-7da1-5c73-9458-0357585e1a4b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/05/19/business/19Borrow/19Borrow-articleLarge.jpg?year=2010&h=315&w=600&s=8ab04a7c2c56a0d71416fd4a6355e328146b873b7d9262b870c4a81e7a08b8a3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Shoppers in central Warsaw.

Style,The Nude Pictures That Won't Go Away,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/12/style/jonathan-leder-photographer-emily-ratajkowski-modeling.html,"In September, the model and actress Emily Ratajkowski published an essay describing, among other injurious experiences, being sexually assaulted by a photographer named Jonathan Leder when she was 20. For years afterward, Ms. Ratajkowski wrote on The Cut, nude and seminude Polaroids from that shoot have been shown in galleries and republished without her permission. In response, Mr. Leder called Ms. Ratajkowski's accusations ""false and salacious,"" and her essay ""tawdry and baseless."" Years ago, when Ms. Ratajkowski first began publicly denouncing Mr. Leder for publishing books of her nude shots, the photographer provided The New York Times with a copy of her model release -- a contract specifying or limiting the use of one's image -- signed by Ms. Ratajkowski's agent. The agreement allowed the photos to be used in ""a future book of Polaroids."" But according to Ms. Ratajkowski, her agent denied signing anything; Ms. Ratajkowski also said her lawyer suggested the signature was forged.

Since the publication of Ms. Ratajkowski's essay -- in which she described Mr. Leder penetrating her with his fingers after the photo shoot, while she was drunk on wine he'd provided -- more women have emerged with stories about Mr. Leder, ranging from discomfort with his continued use of certain images to allegations of abuse. The Times tried to contact Mr. Leder, 47, for comment for this article, through phone calls, emails and text. He did not respond. He is not the first photographer accused of exploiting young bodies while gatekeepers shrugged or turned the other way; Terry Richardson, Bruce Weber, Mario Testino and Patrick Demarchelier have also been accused of misconduct. (None of these men have been charged with a crime, and all have issued denials. Only one -- Mr. Weber -- faces lawsuits.) ""These are the kinds of stories that we hear every day,"" said Sara Ziff, founder of Model Alliance, a labor rights nonprofit that runs a support line and workshops.

Their magazine, inspired by vintage issues of Playboy and featuring what Mr. Leder once described as ""wholesome"" nudity, was well received. He was soon asked to shoot videos for brands like Adidas and Louis Vuitton. In October of 2011, after two years of marriage and two children together, Ms. Hettara said she confronted her husband about his involvement with Nola Palmer, the lead actress of a feature film he was directing. During that argument, according to a police report Ms. Hettara filed in Woodstock, N.Y., Mr. Leder choked her while she held their infant daughter. At that moment, she said in an interview, ""I was so shaken up that I couldn't remember the number to call 911."" She went to the police five days later, after speaking to friends and family and intermittently trying to reconcile with Mr. Leder. She was granted an order of protection. Mr. Leder was arrested and charged in January 2012 with criminal obstruction of breathing or blood circulation and endangering the welfare of a child, but acquitted at trial. (The case record is sealed, but Mr. Leder's acquittal was discussed in a divorce-related hearing in September 2017; at this hearing, Mr. Leder denied the incident and denied ever being violent with any woman, according to the court transcript.) Over the years Ms. Hettara told her story to business associates, she said, hoping they might stop working with him. ""A lot of people didn't care, because as you can see, the modeling agencies just sent him models,"" she said.""I immediately got painted as this jealous housewife."" In a 2014 issue of Jacques -- themed around betrayal, with Mr. Leder off the masthead -- Ms. Hettara identified herself as ""a domestic abuse survivor"" who ""had a nervous breakdown because of it."" She and Ms. Palmer, who had broken from Mr. Leder, did a photo shoot together and exchanged emotional public letters.

""For a year I felt crazy,"" Ms. Hettara wrote in her letter. ""It's part of his abuse -- he makes you feel and look crazy."" The week after Ms. Ratajkowski's essay was published, Ms. Palmer, 29, wrote on Instagram that Mr. Leder was ""my abuser,"" too. He would, she said, monitor her weight and control her hairstyle and clothing. He would tell her not to work with anyone else. He taught her that ""my body can only be respected or appreciated if it's naked,"" she said. She has since changed her name, she said, to make a break with the person that he controlled. While shooting Mr. Leder's film in Florida -- where she also temporarily lived with him, Ms. Hettara and their two children -- she called her parents and agent to tell them she was scared and wanted to go home, she said. Ms. Palmer's agent emailed Mr. Leder in May 2011. In the note, reviewed by The Times, the agent told Mr. Leder that she'd spoken to Ms. Palmer and was concerned. She asked him to call Ms. Palmer's father, as well as make other living arrangements for her: ""While you feel sometimes like a big brother, also big brothers can be a pain to deal with and little sisters as well,"" she wrote. She told Mr. Leder once the film got rolling, the footage of Ms. Palmer, then 19, ""will be AMAZING."" The movie, in which Ms. Palmer played a stripper, was not finished. Because of the unreleased footage in Mr. Leder's possession, she said, she has worried about speaking out against him. She also drank while filming with him.

Shortly after Ms. Hettara and Mr. Leder separated, Ms. Hettara said she discovered in a storage locker several contact sheets from a magazine shoot he was hired to do in 2011. The subject was a 15-year-old girl, who, in some images, has her top unbuttoned to reveal a sheer bra; in another she was posed kneeling, with her legs slightly spread, on a mattress. Models younger than 15 have long been used in fashion photography, but the photos Ms. Hettara found went further than her and Mr. Leder's typical work with minors, she said, and she found them deeply troubling, as she has described in court documents. Young girls still routinely find themselves asked to undress during shoots, and do not always feel empowered to say no, Ms. Ziff said Often, models don't feel comfortable complaining to their agent, she said, because ""they don't want to seem difficult to work with and jeopardize future bookings.""

Ms. Sorbara said she didn't feel uncomfortable until the second shoot. When she arrived, she said, she was surprised by the concept: ""1950s-1960s lesbian porn pinup."" At one point Mr. Leder asked her to kiss another model, who was then his girlfriend, and she said no. After seeing the photos, Ms. Sorbara asked, through her agent, that her name be removed from the project. Mr. Leder agreed according to emails provided to The Times. Not only did ""Vol. 1"" include her name -- and, on the cover, her photo -- but over the next two years, she saw images from that shoot in a Los Angeles gallery show and in another art publication. ""These were photos that were used for different projects that I had never given him permission to use,"" Ms. Sorbara said. She wanted her agency, Wilhelmina Models, to take legal action. ""I trusted this photographer with these photos because the agency set me up with him,"" she wrote in an email to the agency. ""But now these photos are being reproduced and sold over and over again."" An agent told her in 2015 he would look into it. But he added that he didn't like her tone; he had been ""against you shooting in that manor [sic] for a while,"" he wrote, and this ""should be a learning experience in your career to make sure not to put yourself in uncomfortable types of shoots."" In a statement, Wilhelmina said that in Ms. Sorbara's case, a lawyer advised the agency that ""it was not likely that there had been a breach of contract that would enable Ms. Sorbara, or Wilhelmina, to pursue a claim.""

The following year, in 2016, she arrived at a casting call to discover the job was another shoot with Mr. Leder in Woodstock. He wasn't at the casting, but she was distraught that her agency had put her in the position to potentially encounter him again. She received an apology and was promised the agency had recorded that ""you or no other girl should shoot with this photographer."" But Ms. Sorbara said she believes ""young women continue to get thrown into the fire pit"" until ""agencies take a stand,"" or until there's more industry oversight of photographers. Ms. Sorbara also believes there are ethical ways to stage and share artistic nudes; the problem is not the content. One photographer, Stacey Mark, said recently that before selling a print of a topless model to an interested buyer, she called the model to make sure it was OK. ""She was like: I've never been asked that before,'"" Ms. Mark said. Ms. Mark shot for Jacques magazine, as well as more mainstream magazines. She has photographed both Ms. Sorbara and Ms. Palmer, who've both confided in her their experiences with Mr. Leder. She also dated Mr. Leder in the late '90s and early 2000s. It was an unhealthy relationship, she said, describing him as manipulative and mean. On Instagram, after Ms. Ratajkowski's essay was published, she called him ""an abusive monster.""

She wanted to walk down a street in Williamsburg without seeing a topless photo of herself on a passer-by's T-shirt (sold by ASOS in 2013). In 2014, she sent a cease-and-desist letter to Mr. Leder after discovering he had included intimate footage of her in a video promoting a zine in which she did not appear. Some of her battles have been unsuccessful. Jacques folded after its ninth edition in 2015.Mr. Leder has sole legal custody of their two children, although she sees them on alternate weekends and holidays (with extra weekends in certain months and a full month in the summer). In court documents, Ms. Hettara and Mr. Leder have accused each other of abandonment and neglect. He has called her ""bizarre"" and reported her to the Woodstock police for threatening his life (she has not been charged). Recently, representing herself pro se, Ms. Hettara tried to use Ms. Ratajkowski's allegations to have her custody restored. Ms. Ratajkowski's essay mentions the children multiple times, including when Ms. Ratajkowski wonders, post-assault, if she's sleeping in his daughter's bed. The order was denied. Ms. Hettara, now 34, has never met or spoken to Ms. Ratajkowski, 29. But Ms. Palmer and Ms. Ratajkowski used to be friends, although they hadn't shared their stories about Mr. Leder with each other until recently. ""The silver lining is that we finally get to find healing through it,"" Ms. Palmer said. Ms. Ratajkowski declined to be interviewed for this article but provided a statement through her publicist: ""Writing 'Buying Myself Back' wasn't easy to do and publishing it was even scarier. But hearing from other women (inside the industry and out) about how much it resonated with them and spoke to their own experiences made me feel hopeful and simply less alone -- a feeling that shouldn't be underestimated. ""It's devastating to realize how many young women have been taken advantage of and felt powerless to do anything about it,"" the statement said.",Emily Ratajkowski accused the photographer Jonathan Leder of assault and using photos against her wishes.

Technology,"An Eye for Photography, but a Google Suite for Events",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/17/technology/personaltech/an-eye-for-photography-but-a-google-suite-for-events.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Whitney Richardson, an events manager for The Times in London, discussed the tech she's using. Q. What tech do you use to put together events? A. Over the past year, I have really expanded my use of the entire Google suite -- and I use its tools for basically everything, especially the Google Drive app on my phone. From my phone, I can share files with multiple clients with Google folders and I can manage my budget in Google sheets. I've used Google forms to quickly collect feedback from attendees of events I produced. For presentations, I use Google slides (and begin brainstorming while on the commute to work). I can video chat with a group of people in different countries using Google video chat and sync all appointments and meetings to my calendar.

What do you like about the tools, and what could be better? I appreciate being able to store all of my documents in one place and being able to walk into meetings with just my phone and still have my files at my fingertips without logging in to multiple accounts. I've gone to high-level meetings with just my phone, and people seem genuinely surprised that I am able to quickly refer to key data points or notes without having a laptop or a notebook in front of me.

I look forward to the day when we have an American version of the popular Chinese app WeChat, where I can really sync all of my day-to-day apps in one place. With all of the recent data security breaches we have had in the past few years (Equifax, Facebook), I also want the assurance of having online services that are impenetrable to hackers. You were previously a photo editor at The Times. Plenty of photographers are experimenting with new ways to take pictures using drones and virtual reality. What do you think will stick around? We are in a renaissance period of photography, when technology is ultimately changing the way humans relate to imagery. Photos are no longer used just as a way to capture a moment. They are an actual form of communication. A while ago, I read an interview with Kevin Systrom, co-founder of Instagram, who said he realized early on that people were willing to forgo quality in an image for the ability to quickly share it with their networks. In my opinion, the tools that will stick around are the ones that make capturing and sharing visual information as seamless as possible.

I absolutely love what our photojournalists have been doing with drone video and photography. A few months ago, I worked with my colleague Josh Haner on a story about plans to make the Hoover Dam into a giant battery. Josh was able to capture stunning drone footage over the Hoover Dam, which really allowed viewers to see the massive scale of the structure in a way that made the story come to life. I am also excited to see where augmented reality and holographic video is headed in the news business. Our recent story on Ashley Graham, which we published during Fashion Week, took my breath away, but it took 100 cameras to record her runway walk in 3-D. This then goes back to the issue of scalability and making these tools readily available for journalists to use for alternative story forms. How can we create tools that make stories like this not a one-off, that more journalists can access to really lift The Times's report over all? What do you wish would go away? I want portable 360-degree video cameras to take a break until we can figure out how to scale them without completely compromising image resolution. I don't think they have found that sweet spot just yet. Outside of work, what tech product are you currently obsessed with? In my daily life, I cannot live without my Bose wireless noise-canceling headphones. I hesitated getting them for a while, but my husband got them for me as a gift and I will never go back to normal earphones. (No more cords!) I also have several portable mirror sets with LED bulbs, which I pack when I am traveling to help with makeup application and general skin care.

And when my husband and I travel, we love using Airbnb. We have actually gone on a vacation planned around an Airbnb location because we were interested in the living space and wanted to experience it. Like most new businesses in the gig economy, it is shaking up the hotel industry in a good way, I think, and allowing people alternative ways to experience new cities in unexpected ways. You're new to London. How do the British use tech differently from Americans (or not)? The one striking difference I have noticed between living in London and New York is not exactly tech -- it's the efficiency of the bus and train system in London. The Times has done a ton of coverage of New York's crumbling trains, and there are no clear signs of improvement. The subway and bus system in London runs on time, and there are all sorts of updated indicators on platforms and by certain bus stops for when your transport will arrive (and they are accurate). It has made commuting on public transportation much more enjoyable.",She was a photo editor. Now she's an events manager.

Style,Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Political Cost of Hair,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/11/style/alexandria-ocasio-cortez-hair-cost.html,"Hair has once again caused a political tempest in a blow dryer. This week , the Washington Times published a story saying that Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez had spent $80 on a haircut and $180 on color at a Washington, D.C. salon, a styling choice the newspaper presented as hypocritical, given she ""regularly rails against the rich and complains about the cost of living inside the Beltway."" Almost immediately, charges of sexism and superficiality began to fly online (also, a debate about the average price of a woman's haircut, and how little men seem to understand the cost of certain aspects of life).

It would be easy to dismiss this as mere distraction, except it is also the latest in a long line of hair-related controversies in the corridors of power that have surrounded both men and women. Hair is, it seems, a particularly -- well, tangled, subject. Not to mention an equal-opportunity target. Hillary Clinton acknowledged it in 2014, when she joked that the subtitle of her memoir, ""Hard Choices,"" should be ""The Scrunchie Chronicles: 112 Countries and It's Still All About My Hair."" Though Mrs. Clinton is probably the most famous hair lightning rod, whether it was her chopping and changing while in the White House as first lady (seen as reflecting the opportunism of her husband's policies), her I-don't-care-I'm-getting-down-to-work scrunchies as secretary of state, her John Barrett styling trip while on the campaign trail (average price per cut: $600) or her postelection lank and limp blues, she is far from the only politician scrutinized.

Her husband was also mocked as far back as 1993 for having a plane wait on the tarmac in Los Angeles while he received a trim from Cristophe of Beverly Hills. The New York Times reported: ""Questions about Mr. Clinton's runway razor cut dominated the White House news briefing today, with the communications director, George Stephanopoulos, scrambling to explain why the populist President tied up one of the country's busiest airports to have his hair trimmed."" John Edwards, of course, became something of a poster boy for follicular faux pas during the 2007 presidential campaign when it was revealed he had indulged in two haircuts totaling approximately $800 at a time when he was attempting to sell himself as a champion for working class Americans. It's not just an American obsession. In 2016, Francois Hollande, then the president of France, came under fire for a reported $10,000 a month styling bill, which was seen as inappropriate for a socialist (it even got its own hashtag: #Coiffuregate).

During the 2015 Canadian election, Justin Trudeau's hair, which, in its lushness, seemed to represent his youth and privilege, had its own Twitter account -- @TrudeausHair. The Economist referred to him as the ""hair apparent"" (a reference to his father, former Prime Minister Pierre-Elliott Trudeau). And he wasn't the only one under a follicular microscope: the hair of all the (all-male) candidates played a fairly public role in that election.

It's fair to say hair is not just some stringy stuff on the top of our heads. According to Grant McCracken, an anthropologist and author of ""Big Hair,"" our hair is ""our court of deliberation, the place where we contemplate who and what we are."" It is visible, accessible, gender-freighted. It has associations with sex, punishment, class and power. It is probably not happenstance that the United States has not elected a bald president since Dwight D. Eisenhower left office in 1961. When it comes to politics, to care too much about hair, to spend too much on it, makes one seen as superficial and vain; focused on yourself at the expense (literally sometimes) of taxpayers. Ignore it and you are sloppy and lack attention to detail. Men have traditionally used their ability to get inexpensive barber-trims as bragging rights and something of a badge of hono r. In the Washington Times story, former Attorney General Jeff Sessions is lauded for the fact he got his cuts at the Senate Hair Care Services in the basement of the Russell Senate Office Building for a mere $20 -- though it is acknowledged that ""men's haircuts there and everywhere else are cheaper than women's."" In turn, women have often complained about a double standard in price and scrutiny. This has only become more true in the age of Instagram, and during a White House administration where hair has played an outsize symbolic role, from the glossy, blow-dried locks of pretty much all the women in the Trump orbit (the first lady, Tiffany Trump, Vanessa Trump, Kimberly Guilfoyle, Hope Hicks -- and Ivanka before the bob) to the orange-hued and complicated comb-over worn by the president himself. People joke about it, but no one forgets it. Fact is, we're talking about hair more than ever these days, not less. All of which suggests that, whether we like it or not, when it comes to politics (as when it comes to a lot of life), a trim is rarely just a trim. It's a weapon, and a tool. If we don't admit that and wield it ourselves -- with humor, ideally -- then someone else will.",Why are we so obsessed?,fcda97f3-fe4f-5f8a-90fa-66d4b27024ea,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/10/11/world/11AOC-hair1/11AOC-hair1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=5d5bf8b7ac962908755889379589fd2bc77ac5f48eb72b82f3f0566b91f5daca&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez adjusting her hair during a town hall meeting in New York last week.,fcda97f3-fe4f-5f8a-90fa-66d4b27024ea,N24News/imgs/fcda97f3-fe4f-5f8a-90fa-66d4b27024ea.jpg,15
Books,Leif Enger's New Novel Brims With Grace and Quirky Charm,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/02/books/review/leif-enger-virgil-wander.html,"What a wondrous miracle, to wake up, memory muddled, slightly unmoored, with just the task of relearning yourself, your friends, your hometown nestled along the ruggedly beautiful shores of Lake Superior. Everything that once was rundown and rusted suddenly seems new and exotic, buffed to a striking shine.

Such is the plight of Virgil Wander, who gives 's new novel its name and is one of the most engaging protagonists I've encountered in years. Wander is an orphan, a fallen seminarian, a movie-theater owner. After his car plunges off a cliff into the icy waters of the lake below, his memory and capacity for language are compromised.

The world of fiction has always rewarded the obsession, the fetish, and ""Virgil Wander"" is jam-packed with such eccentricities -- baseball, surfing, beachcombing, fishing, classic films, taxidermy, Jeep Wagoneers. Reading the novel is like walking into your beloved uncle's bachelor pad: Every page is packed with curios and brimming with delightful nostalgia. But the nostalgia is well modulated. As Virgil's memory begins to resolve, so does the glimmer of his small town begin to fade. Greenstone, Minn., is a Rust Belt port, a little pockmark along Highway 61 up to Canada. Is it beautiful? Sure, but mostly because of the lake and seasons. Its monolithic ore dock is an everyday reminder of the town's decay, as are the vacancies along Main Street and Virgil's own derelict movie theater.

Against this richly drawn background, Enger weaves in a few different strands, including some that explore notions of fatherlessness and orphanhood. Every narrative thread is infused with the magical. Greenstone is a place where phantoms lurk out on the big lake, where old men fly kites into the fangs of lightning and where there's always an outside chance Bob Dylan might stroll onto the Main Street stage. Enger has endowed Minnesota's North Shore with a luminousness reminiscent of Annie Proulx's Newfoundland.","In ""Virgil Wander,"" a resident of a fading Rust Belt town embarks on a voyage of rediscovery after a car accident wipes his memory clean.",eb3f108a-41b7-5605-bf2a-884dce6ebfaf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/11/04/books/review/04Butler1/04Butler1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=55820b304ab633be470a68f98811a1cf62c8b17284b64f89ed36a10c2eeec2dc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Leif Enger,eb3f108a-41b7-5605-bf2a-884dce6ebfaf,N24News/imgs/eb3f108a-41b7-5605-bf2a-884dce6ebfaf.jpg,13
Television,Where to Go After 'Mad Men'? A Canadian Dramedy,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/10/arts/television/mad-men-slings-arrows.html,"I've been sad ever since ""The Americans"" ended, and before finding ""The Americans,"" I'd been sad ever since ""Mad Men"" ended. My friends and family seem unimpressed that I rewatch these shows so often. Can you help? I enjoy ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" and ""The Crown,"" but they're not ""The Americans"" and ""Mad Men."" -- Emily

Here's what I think ""The Americans"" and ""Mad Men"" have in common (that ""Mrs. Maisel"" and ""The Crown"" don't share): a lot of the dialogue has a double meaning because the main characters lead double lives, and all the ways they love and think and behave are refracted through their shattered selfhoods. Layers, baby!

Start with ""Slings & Arrows."" It's a Canadian dramedy (currently on Acorn) about a Shakespearean theater festival, which of course does not have the obvious emotional heft of Cold War espionage or the spiritual nothingness of sales-as-American-identity. Except trust me: It does in a bunch of ways. Our hero, Geoffrey (Paul Gross), has returned to direct a new staging of ""Hamlet,"" a play he once starred in to great acclaim. In the interim, he spent a long time in a mental health facility. So the dialogue from the characters covers the real hurt they've all experienced but also their deep desire never to admit that hurt; the conflicted emotions they want to draw on for their performances but also a sense of certainty that they are playing the characters in the best way; and the dissonance of making a performance ""real,"" even though, by nature, it is artifice.

Sometimes when I watch a show, I feel like I care more about it than the people who made it -- I remember more plot lines, wonder about more characters, still care about unresolved B-stories. I never felt like that watching ""Mad Men"" or ""The Americans,"" where every date, song, font or nightie had this rich purpose. The same is true for ""Rectify,"" a much slower and more humid show about a man newly released from death row in Georgia. (It's on Netflix.)

Media,Ritual of Ever-Present Coverage May Not Pass Muster With Trump,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/business/media/under-a-trump-administration-presidential-press-pool-may-be-a-ritual-under-threat.html,"To understand how President-elect Donald J. Trump's spontaneous meal this week at the ""21"" Club, the Manhattan nightspot, could turn into a flash point on the future of American journalism, it's best to start with what the news media already knows about its future charge. Since Election Day, Mr. Trump has refused to let reporters accompany him to the White House, accused the media of inciting protests and tweeted accusations that The New York Times fabricated stories about his transition. As a candidate, he vilified journalists by name and blacklisted news outlets that displeased him. So when Mr. Trump ducked out to dinner Tuesday night without informing the journalists assigned to cover him, it struck White House reporters as a small but significant omen that cordial relations between the president and his press corps, a hallmark of the West Wing, were under threat. Is it a big deal if a president goes to dinner and the press doesn't know? In a word, yes, according to former administration officials, journalists and a group of press advocacy organizations that issued an open letter to Mr. Trump on Wednesday arguing that Americans ""deserve to know what the president is doing.""

""The country is well served by having a press who is there and can keep a check on any president,"" said Ari Fleischer, who as George W. Bush's longtime press secretary often clashed with journalists. ""Even on Sept. 11, we recognized the important need for the country of having a pool travel with the president."" The broader idea, advocates argue, is that the president's whereabouts ought to be recorded -- for public reassurance and the historical record, and so the president has reporters nearby to quickly communicate with the public in a crisis. And if Mr. Trump rejects the decades-old practice of the ""pool,"" where journalists follow the president even to the most banal engagements, will he adhere to other traditions such as news conferences and press briefings that are meant to inform the public about matters of greater import, but are not mandated by law? ""My friends who cover the White House say that the Obama administration was probably the most closed administration that they have ever tried to cover,"" said Sally Quinn, the longtime chronicler of Washington media and society. ""They ain't seen nothing yet."" The challenge now for the Washington press corps may be convincing the broader public that these decades-old protocols still matter even in an age of instant communication tools like Twitter that bypass traditional news outlets, and in the face of a groundswell of public skepticism toward the establishment press, whose supposed coziness with the White House was one of Mr. Trump's favorite talking points at rallies.

""The media must make clear that an informed press makes an informed public,"" Ms. Katz said. ""The establishment needs to figure out a way to communicate with regular people about what's important."" Mr. Trump's press team has told reporters that it expects to arrange a traditional pool as early as next week, attributing recent hiccups to the hectic transition period. On Wednesday, Jason Miller, a spokesman for Mr. Trump, conceded that the unannounced ""21"" visit ""was an example where there could have been a little bit better communication.""
* What happened on Day 2 of Elizabeth Holmes's testimony.
* Kevin Spacey was ordered to pay $31 million to the 'House of Cards' studio after sexual harassment allegations. But, Mr. Miller added, ""For some in the media, unless they're actually sitting at the table, seeing if he's getting the chicken or the fish, they will never be happy."" That argument seems to resonate with some Trump supporters who are inclined to view White House journalists as abetting establishment politicians, rather than holding them to account. ""I think his base would like nothing more than to see him take on the press, and say, 'I don't care what you think. I'm going to do whatever I want to do,'"" Ms. Quinn said. ""It's been a winning strategy up until now."" During the campaign, Mr. Trump ignored established protocols such as letting reporters travel on his plane. At rallies, journalists were mostly relegated to ""press pens,"" and television networks agreed to the campaign's instructions on where to position their cameras.

In ritual-driven Washington, seemingly mundane variations on presidential customs can make waves: Barack Obama's decision in 2009 to skip the Gridiron Club dinner, an annual black-tie gathering of journalists, made headlines. Mr. Obama has also drawn criticism for his end runs around the White House press corps, opting for venues like a web show with the comedian Zach Galifianakis, over tougher-minded interviews. Ana Marie Cox, who skewered the Washington establishment on her blog Wonkette, said that journalists who overly relied on access might be prompted to do better reporting if Mr. Trump tried to ice them out. ""I hope there's a massive revolt within the Washington press corps,"" Ms. Cox said, ""and people refuse to play by the rules that they played by in the past."" Bill Clinton's former press secretary, Mike McCurry, suggested that the pooling arrangement could use a revamp. ""I think having a bunch of talented journalists sitting around a country club sipping Arnold Palmers while the president plays golf is an utter waste of time,"" Mr. McCurry told Politico on Wednesday, referring to the pool that accompanies the president to golf outings. White House aides, however, are not the most trustworthy narrators of what the president is doing day to day. And history is filled with events where journalists served as important eyewitnesses for the public. Pool reporters were on hand when Ronald Reagan was shot outside a Washington hotel in 1981, and the same with John F. Kennedy's motorcade in Dallas. Journalists were also with George W. Bush in a Florida school when the World Trade Center was attacked in 2001, and later accompanied him onto Air Force One. ""You do not want a president uncovered if something like 9/11 happens,"" said George Condon, a correspondent for the National Journalwho has covered the White House since 1982 and has led the White House Correspondents' Association. ""The country needs to know where the president is, and how he's doing, and how he reacted."" ""I know presidents chafe at it,"" Mr. Condon said of the scrutiny from the press. But, he added, ""presidents who think they can reinvent it, who think that they don't have to do things like that, and are so flush with their own victory, almost always -- and in fact I can't think of any exceptions -- regret it.""",Reporters who thought the Obama administration was closed may be up against something much more opaque.,d0279445-b36b-5e10-a02f-30860ffd6951,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/16/business/17TRUMPPRESS/17TRUMPPRESS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=80a7d6fcc138aa4ec1c04aee3ec0baf3022dc7c2f78e641df4da6dfc6405bea3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"President-elect Donald J.

Media,"Gannett, the Owner of USA Today, Is About to Get a Whole Lot Bigger",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/05/business/media/gannett-acquired-gatehouse-media.html,"Gannett, the Owner of USA Today, Is About to Get a Whole Lot Bigger

An agreement between two large newspaper chains on Monday laid the groundwork for a new publishing behemoth while raising questions about future investments in local journalism. New Media Investment Group, a holding company that controls GateHouse Media, announced that it had agreed to buy Gannett, the owner of USA Today and more than 100 other publications nationwide, in a transaction valued at roughly $1.4 billion. Once combined, GateHouse and Gannett will publish more than 260 daily newspapers in the United States, along with more than 300 weekly publications, in 47 states, as well as Guam. The new company will go by the name Gannett. The companies expect that savings from the merger, which is expected to be completed by the end of the year, would total as much as $300 million annually. And though they said the merger would ""enhance quality journalism,"" both companies have cut costs in recent years by laying off journalists.

Gannett owns The Detroit Free Press, The Arizona Republic, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and other prominent newspapers in small, midsize and large cities. GateHouse Media, which owns 154 daily newspapers and operates in 39 states, has been on a buying spree in recent years, striking deals to acquire The Austin American-Statesman, The Palm Beach Post and The Akron Beacon Journal. The planned merger comes more out of perceived weakness than strength: With a few exceptions, newspapers are struggling as readers abandon ink and paper in favor of websites and news apps. Print advertising revenue has plummeted, and the money publishers have made from digital advertising has fallen short of what newspapers used to bring in from print ads. One result has been the increase in so-called ghost papers -- thin versions of once robust publications put out by bare-bones staffs. Although print newspapers are in steep decline, Wall Street-backed companies like GateHouse Media and MediaNews Group, see them as still valuable, if distressed, assets. In 2018, the print business still brought in $25 billion, according to a study by the University of North Carolina. New Media Investment Group, a publicly traded company with headquarters near Rochester, N.Y., has put money into journalism through GateHouse Media. In recent years, GateHouse Media has shrunk newsrooms while pursuing shareholder value, in part by consolidating operations in regional hubs and merging newspapers. Gannett, which has been in the news business for nearly a century, laid off journalists all across the country earlier this year.

In a conference call Monday, Michael Reed, the New Media chairman and chief executive who will run the combined company, declined to specify how cost savings would result from the merger, citing ""efficiencies"" and ""cost reallocation."" New Media is managed by the New York investment management firm Fortress Investment Group through an affiliate. Fortress is owned by SoftBank, a Japanese conglomerate.

Penny Abernathy, a journalism professor at the University of North Carolina who has studied the decline of newspapers, said layoffs were all but guaranteed. Noting that both companies house business functions and even editors in regional centers away from the newsrooms, Ms. Abernathy added that the combinations of shrunken newsrooms and distant management could have a bad effect on local coverage. ""Often you have a publisher responsible for five or six newspapers,"" she said. ""There's no way, when you're removed from that community, that you understand what's happening on the ground in the same way that you would understand it if you lived in that community."" Even before the merger, the two companies were the two largest chains in terms of both number of newspapers owned and circulation, according to researchers at the University of North Carolina. Combined, their papers would have a circulation of more than eight million. Gannett has been a sought-after property. Earlier this year, it fended off a takeover attempt by MediaNews Group, a company controlled by the hedge fund Alden Global Capital. The agreement on Monday calls for Gannett shareholders to receive $12.06 per share in a combination of cash and New Media shares, for a premium of about 18 percent.","GateHouse Media, a newspaper company backed by a hedge fund, agrees to buy the venerable chain for roughly $1.4 billion.

Theater,Review: On the Road With Mom in 'Miss You Like Hell',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/theater/miss-you-like-hell-review-public-theater.html,"This is a fresh take on the American road story, filled with people and ideas we rarely get to see onstage. And if, from the start, it's clear where the ride is headed -- through encounters and adventures to accommodation and rapprochement -- Ms. Hudes still makes room for a surprise conclusion that widens the perspective and encompasses great loss. Let's just say the trip doesn't end in Los Angeles.

But along the way, ""Miss You Like Hell"" too often falls short of its own ambitions. In its eagerness to spotlight the women's present-day lives, it leaves Beatriz's back story seriously underdeveloped. We never learn what she does to get by -- she may be an artist or a welder or both -- or what really happened with Olivia's father. That he doesn't appear seems fair enough, but that he is vilified in absentia opens up questions the text isn't prepared to answer.

At other times it answers questions that didn't need to be asked. Though some of the women's adventures are pertinent to the theme -- for an undocumented immigrant, a minor traffic stop quite naturally becomes an existential problem -- too much time is turned over to diversions apparently meant to be distracting or, worse, heartwarming.

So in Skokie, Ill., mother and daughter meet a retired gay couple (Michael Mulheren and David Patrick Kelly) who are partway through their project of getting married in all 50 states. Neither the show nor the actors seem comfortable with this cute, inorganic story line. And a side trip to Yellowstone National Park, where one of Olivia's blog followers is a junior ranger, is the kind of scene that is justified only by the authors' needs, not by the characters'.

It's probably no coincidence that the musical numbers arising from these detours fall flat. Ms. McKeown, a folk-rock artist who borrows liberally from many genres, has produced a full AM-FM spectrum of contextual styles, but for the most part they lack the structural underpinnings that let musical theater songs do the heavy work asked of them. The lyrics are too often wet and purple, with mushy off rhymes that are particularly problematic in up-tempo numbers (like the gay couple's ""My Bell's Been Rung"") that need the snap of precision.

Ms. Rubin-Vega, with her rough charisma, and Ms. Jimenez, with her youthful loveliness and blue-sky voice, generally make you forget all that. I'm a bit surprised, though, that a production directed by Lear deBessonet requires such forgetting. Ms. deBessonet, the creator of the marvelous Public Works series and the director of a bubbly production of ""A Midsummer Night's Dream"" at the Delacorte last summer, is usually expert at keeping tonal balance. Here she leans into rather than minimizes a tone that is often thick and even mawkish, a problem exacerbated by a physical production (by the set designer Riccardo Hernandez) that feels harshly minimal and -- until a powerful, on-the-nose gesture at the end -- too vague.

It may be that ""Miss You Like Hell,"" which evolved from Ms. Hudes's 2009 drama ""26 Miles"" and had its premiere as a musical at the La Jolla Playhouse in 2016, just needs more time. Certainly events have caught up with (and in some ways outrun) its tear-jerking story, which is pre-emptively set in 2014, before the Trump presidency. But you can't set the audience in 2014; when an officer wearing an ICE uniform appears onstage, everyone knows what nightmare is coming.

Of course, part of Ms. Hudes's plan is to make us understand that people like Beatriz -- whose lives have been spent, as one smart lyric has it, looking over their shoulders -- always did. The rest of us are just catching up.",A new musical at the Public Theater reinvents the family road trip narrative as a mother-daughter tale of immigration policy gone astray.,5ff76d6a-30bf-57aa-8bfc-d8f1afeabc1a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/11/arts/11missyoulikehell-1/11missyoulikehell-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a5f9733867d3ecfdb91216ae7462121eb5044fc6b157dcd1dca1e041328ac505&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Gizel Jim&eacute;nez, left, and Daphne Rubin-Vega play a daughter and mother whose relationship has been distorted by immigration policies.",5ff76d6a-30bf-57aa-8bfc-d8f1afeabc1a,N24News/imgs/5ff76d6a-30bf-57aa-8bfc-d8f1afeabc1a.jpg,10
Theater,"Review: In 'Eddie and Dave,' Van Halen Gets a Makeover",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/theater/eddie-and-dave-review-van-halen-atlantic-theater-company.html,"When it comes to glamorous drag, men who impersonate women have traditionally had an unfair advantage over their female counterparts. Just think of the boundlessly flamboyant options available for guys to transform into gals: baubles, boas, high heels, bouffants, ad infinitum.

As for women doing men, what's their choice, really, beyond business suits and sloppy sweats?

""Eddie and Dave,"" the larky if bloated sketch of a bio-comedy that opened on Tuesday at Stage 2 of the Atlantic Theater Company, helps to correct that imbalance. Its title characters, based on the original guitarist and lead singer of the chart-topping band Van Halen, are indeed men portrayed by women.

But these figures hail from the 1980s, a decade in which big hair and glam metal rock ruled the airwaves. The professional (and often offstage) attire of the male musicians who practiced this earsplitting art embraced a peacock panoply of baubles, boas, high heels and, yes, bouffant coiffures. And it was a look worn not with Dietrich-style elegance, but with swaggering and sweaty machismo.

The female cast members of ""Eddie and Dave,"" written by Amy Staats and directed by Margot Bordelon, appear to be having a high old time finding the testosterone within their characters' teased hair. Swathed in costumes (by Montana Levi Blanco) that might have come from a Ziegfeld girl's trunk and wigs (by Cookie Jordan) that could house a family of squirrels, the angry young rockers of this rambunctious play demonstrate that wearing sequins and fishnets is no guarantee against bad-boy behavior.",Amy Staats's tale of the rowdy rise (and fall and rise and fall) of the rock band lets women loose in the glam metal boys' club.,88c1e575-8c26-53d7-9b85-021cead12624,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/23/arts/23eddiedave1/23eddiedave1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=bf6e8e1bc28de1f06ba892d2b97be35355c6abed954e450d1abeb6a557f20354&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Might as well jump: from left, Adina Verson as Al, Amy Staats as Eddie and Megan Hill as Dave in ""Eddie and Dave"" at the Atlantic Theater Company's Stage 2.",88c1e575-8c26-53d7-9b85-021cead12624,N24News/imgs/88c1e575-8c26-53d7-9b85-021cead12624.jpg,10
Science,"Give a Cow a Brush, and Watch It Scratch That Itch",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/08/science/cows-brush-grooming.html,"Some researchers think mechanical brushes aren't just some spa amenity for dairy cows -- they're important to the animal's well-being.

Cows, like dogs and people, like a good scratch. Outside, they'll rub their bodies against fence posts or trees to remove parasites or just stay clean. Some do it so much, they can break radio transmission towers if you don't fence it off . But many dairy cows in the United States never go to pasture . And even when they do, cows may spend winters tied up in a barn. So if a cow has an itch to scratch -- what's a cow to do? In a lot of places, nothing. But in some places, there's the mechanical brush.

This bristly, swiveling, motorized apparatus spins when a cow touches it, allowing the animal to reach places it couldn't on its own. On average, cows will spend seven minutes a day rubbing their heads, necks and backs on these bulky body buffers. And some researchers think these mechanical brushes aren't just some spa amenity for dairy cows -- they're important to the animal's well-being.

""We have no idea how these cows think,"" said Marina von Keyserlingk, who studies animal welfare at the University of British Columbia in Canada. ""But what we do know is that she's highly motivated to brush. And what happens if she can't?"" Testing the animals' willingness to work for access to fresh feed, mechanical brushes and empty space, Dr. von Keyserlingk and her team trained pregnant, healthy, indoor dairy cows to open a weighted gate. By looking at how much weight they were willing to push before giving up, the researchers got an idea of the relative importance of each resource to the cows. [Like the Science Times page on Facebook. | Sign up for the Science Times newsletter.] The researchers suspected the brush would come in second for hungry cows. But the cows worked just as hard for the brush as fresh food. Their results, published Wednesday in Biology Letters, suggest that a cow may need mechanical brushes for grooming indoors and that dairy farmers should consider having these in their barns. The brushes may benefit farmers by keeping cows from destroying surfaces inside barns and pleasing consumers who increasingly want to know that the animals are healthy and, more important, happy.

""The way I see a cow move under that brush goes way beyond just relieving that itch,"" said Temple Grandin, a researcher at Colorado State University, known for her work on farm animal behavior and welfare and who was not involved in the study. Animals have emotions, perhaps not as complex, but similar to humans, she said (although the nature of these emotions is a hot topic among animal behaviorists). They have the same basic nervous system and the same neurotransmitters in emotional parts of the brain. ""What they don't have is a gigantic cortex that can do things like fly to the moon or build that gigantic computer you're using right now,"" said Dr. Grandin. ""I'm going to say the dairy cow enjoys it. It's like going to the spa."" But Dr. Grandin and Dr. von Keyserlingk think because the cows are so determined to get to the brush, grooming with it may be more like the need to clip your nails. Mechanical brushes are required in Denmark, but not in the United States or Canada. And it may be some time before we see more of them, said Dr. von Keyserlingk, because states and provinces govern animal care in the United States and Canada. They are also expensive and high maintenance. Instead, industry and consumers may drive the demand for cattle brushes. ""If you can get industry to take charge and they can adapt these best practices, they're much more nimble than legislation,"" Dr. von Keyserlingk said.",Some researchers think mechanical brushes aren't just some spa amenity for dairy cows — they're important to the animal's well-being.,a4d0ac81-94b0-51a6-a7ba-e5a60b35397d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/14/science/14TB-COWBRUSH/09TB-COWBRUSH-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a60f5d0996b1bcbe45606b15c07f368686b6493843e026fe0afb1ba9b594730c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The pleasures of good grooming are not lost on cows, it turns out.",a4d0ac81-94b0-51a6-a7ba-e5a60b35397d,N24News/imgs/a4d0ac81-94b0-51a6-a7ba-e5a60b35397d.jpg,2
Music,"David Daniels, Opera Star, Is Arrested on Sexual Assault Charge",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/30/arts/music/david-daniels-opera-sexual-assault.html,"The opera singer David Daniels, one of the world's leading countertenors, was arrested on Tuesday on a sexual assault charge stemming from a 2010 incident in Houston. Mr. Daniels and his husband, Scott Walters, were arrested Tuesday afternoon in Michigan, where they live, on warrants issued by the Houston Police Department, said Detective Lt. Aimee Metzer of the Ann Arbor Police Department. The two men, who were being held in the Washtenaw County Jail in Michigan on Wednesday while awaiting a hearing on bail and extradition, denied the accusations. Mr. Daniels rose to fame as a countertenor, singing high parts that were once the province of castratos or mezzo-sopranos at the Metropolitan Opera and around the world. When he and Mr. Walters were married in 2014, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, an avid opera fan, officiated. Now, with his arrest, Mr. Daniels becomes the most prominent classical music star to face criminal charges of sexual misconduct in the wake of the national #MeToo reckoning. Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters were each charged with sexual assault in connection to a 2010 incident in which a singer said he was drugged and assaulted by the couple, according to charging documents filed by the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Texas.

The singer, Samuel Schultz, said in an interview in August that the two men assaulted him in May 2010, when, as a graduate student at Rice University in Houston, he had gone to hear Mr. Daniels in Handel's ""Xerxes"" at Houston Grand Opera. After attending the performance and cast party, Mr. Schultz said, he was invited to Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters's apartment. There, he said, he was given a drink that caused him to lose consciousness. He awoke alone, he said, naked and bleeding from his rectum. A lawyer for Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters denied the accusations. ""David and Scott are innocent of any wrongdoing,"" their lawyer, Matt Hennessy, said in a statement. ""Sam Schultz is not a victim. He never would have gotten this much attention from his singing, and he knows and resents that fact. He waited eight years to complain about adult, consensual sex to ride the #MeToo movement to unearned celebrity. We will fight this."" Mr. Schultz said in an email that he had been told about the arrests by the Houston police, but he declined further comment. Mr. Schultz said over the summer that he had initially been afraid that making the accusations would damage his fledgling career. But he went public last summer -- first anonymously, in an online post, and then naming Mr. Daniels and Mr. Walters as his attackers in an interview with The New York Daily News. A Houston police officer, D.H. Escobar, wrote in the charging documents that he had found Mr. Schultz, who was identified in the report only by his initials, to be ""credible and reliable."" The officer said that he had met with a therapist Mr. Schultz consulted in 2010, and that her notes were consistent with what Mr. Schultz had told the police. The officer said that he had also reviewed medical records which showed that Mr. Schultz had sought medical attention ""as a result of the sexual assault"" on June 1, 2010.

The charging documents state that the Houston police officer had reviewed a report by the University of Michigan Police Department, which had also investigated the incident over the summer. According to that report, Mr. Daniels had told university police that he had invited Mr. Schultz back to his apartment for a nightcap, where ""things became sexual."" Mr. Walters told the university police that Mr. Schultz had taken an Ambien after seeing Mr. Walters and Mr. Daniels take them, according the report, adding that he then grew ""woozy."" And Mr. Daniels told the police that, two days after that encounter, Mr. Schultz had ""freaked out"" and contacted him and Mr. Walters, telling them ""you know what you did"" before blocking further contact with them, the report said. Mr. Daniels has been a voice professor in recent years at the University of Michigan. A student paper, The Michigan Daily, reported that the school granted Mr. Daniels tenure in May, despite the fact that it had received an anonymous complaint of sexual misconduct two months earlier. Another student, Andrew Lipian, sued the school and Mr. Daniels in October, accusing Mr. Daniels of sexual misconduct; Mr. Daniels filed a countersuit. Kim Broekhuizen, a spokeswoman for the university, said in an email that Mr. Daniels had been on leave since August. ""We will continue to closely monitor the situation as we determine the appropriate next steps,"" she said.",Mr. Daniels and his husband were arrested on Tuesday on charges stemming from an incident in Houston in 2010.,293a0eac-d651-57b3-9203-5da0f29be92b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/31/arts/31daniels-item/31daniels-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=5586f405d6c922f276201bfc97961cb23b323db8db892e79abe31a14286d8a96&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The countertenor David Daniels appearing in ""The Enchanted Island"" at the Metropolitan Opera in 2011.

Food,Celebrating the Great Australian Tradition of Meat in a Box,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/07/dining/halal-snack-pack-australia.html,"The artist at Smith Kebabs in Collingwood, Melbourne, has a style similar to Jackson Pollock's. For a canvas, he uses French fries (chips!), topped with cheese and thinly sliced halal lamb and chicken. His medium is sauce: barbecue, creamy garlic and tart chile. The resulting creation, kaleidoscopic in its thickly splattered patina and creamy-crisp, meaty glory, is the halal snack pack. Also known as H.S.P., the snack pack became a mainstay of Australian kebab and souvlaki shops, as well as other independent fast-food joints, in the last few decades. It's almost always a takeout item, and is almost always called the halal snack pack, whether or not it is genuinely halal. You can get it topped with sliced beef, chicken or lamb, or a mix, and it is increasingly offered in various vegan preparations. ""You want all the sauces?"" the person taking your order will ask. The correct answer is ""Yes,"" or ""Yes, please, with extra chile.""

I've been spending a lot of time thinking about and craving the snack pack in recent weeks. This strange era of social distancing will be remembered as the age of home cooking and takeout, and the usual foam plastic to-go packaging of the H.S.P. is a vital part of its identity (though an environmentally unfriendly one).

[Sign up here to get the At Home newsletter with our best suggestions for how to live a full and cultured life during the pandemic, delivered to your inbox.] I am looking primarily for comfort in eating these days, for unabashed deliciousness, and this dish provides it in spades. There are comparisons to be made to poutine, or chili cheese fries, and I'm not here to denigrate either of those splendid creations. But I will say that I find the H.S.P. slightly more dynamic, and slightly less tiresome two-thirds of the way in. But beyond its obvious meaty, carby comfort, the halal snack pack has the potential to satisfy a deep need for connection in these oddly lonely weeks and months. It is, after all, a dish that came to symbolize togetherness and the rejection of bigotry. The snack pack had its most visible moment of cultural relevance in Australia four years ago, when it played a starring role in a parliamentary drama that stretched over several months.

During his speech, Mr. Dastyari mentioned the Halal Snack Pack Appreciation Society, a popular Facebook group (which then had about 90,000 members) where fans rated and praised snack packs from around the country. The group had a list of guidelines for how to approach these ratings, with points given for proper, well-displayed halal certification. During the federal election in July of that year, the new class of politicians included the first female Muslim member of Parliament, Anne Aly, and Pauline Hanson of the One Nation party, who ran on a strong anti-Islam platform. (One Nation's website currently calls for halting the construction of mosques and Islamic schools until an inquiry is held to determine whether Islam is ""a religion or totalitarian political ideology undermining our democracy and way of life."") In congratulating Ms. Hanson for her win during a television broadcast, Mr. Dastyari invited her out to try a halal snack pack with him. ""Not happening. Not interested in halal, thank you."" Ms. Hanson said. In her maiden speech in the Senate, Ms. Hanson called for a ban on Muslim immigration to Australia. Ms. Aly, for her part, began wearing a halal snack pack brooch to Parliament, telling BuzzFeed News, ""I just love the H.S.P. movement. It's the most Aussie thing that thousands of people can come together, regardless of race or religion, because of a mutual love of meat and chips.""","While social distancing, Australians should unify under their love of a takeout classic, the halal snack pack.",b20e2b29-e074-5e69-87b0-f141e21e737d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/07/dining/07fare1/07fare1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=a0e9fad0fb812d0a4956b3c2a8c5af93a6c7e72baa26589804c1e847ec3b22f8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The lamb halal snack pack at Smith Kebabs in Collingwood, Melbourne.",b20e2b29-e074-5e69-87b0-f141e21e737d,N24News/imgs/b20e2b29-e074-5e69-87b0-f141e21e737d.jpg,17
Real Estate,Affordable Housing Back in Play,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/10/realestate/in-the-region-connecticut-affordable-housing-back-in-play.html,"ON THE MAP Ferry Crossing, a 16-unit apartment project in Old Saybook, was designed for a broad spectrum of incomes. It is fully rented.

AFTER a long recessionary torpor, an incentive program intended to help communities create affordable housing appears to be on the verge of revival. Called HOMEConnecticut, the state program was just taking off in 2008 when its financing was reduced and the housing market went into free fall. By that time, about 50 communities had received technical assistance grants to help them create high-density ""incentive housing zones,"" but only 9 have since followed through. The state Office of Policy and Management, which oversees the program, has been sitting on the $1 million it has left in financing. Administrators now hope to resume incentive payments, this time to encourage towns to adopt the housing zone regulations and begin issuing building permits. The policy office has asked lawmakers to allow it more flexibility in determining the size of grants so that it can stretch its scarce dollars across more communities.

""It's a start,"" said Dimple Desai, the office's community development director. ""Once we see that there's a lot of interest, that's a good enough reason to go to the legislature and say, 'Our program needs more money because there's more demand.' That's what we have to prove now."" Mr. Desai already has one project to point to: The first development to be built in a state-approved incentive housing zone opens this month in Old Saybrook. Called Ferry Crossing, it consists of 16 single-family town houses built on land donated by the town. Aimed at a broad income spectrum, Ferry Crossing has a three-tiered rent structure adjusted for households earning 25, 50 and 80 percent of the area median income (currently $98,600 for a family of four). All 16 town houses are rented. ""We had over 200 families that requested an application,"" said Tony Lyons, the president of the Hope Partnership, the nonprofit organization that partnered with the town on the project. ""At the end of the day, we had almost 60 qualified applicants."" Under the HOME program, towns are eligible for grants of up to $2,000 per unit once they adopt the housing zone regulations. Towns are also eligible for grants of up to $5,000 per unit for each building permit issued.

Old Saybrook decided to move ahead without any guarantee that those incentives would materialize -- ""no one is really counting on it,"" Mr. Lyons said. The same is true in Branford, which just adopted incentive housing zone regulations and has submitted them for state approval. ""We're cognizant of the troubles the state has,"" said Richard Stoecker, Branford's assistant planner, ""and in the past there have been housing programs that start up and sputter away. But we realize that there need to be some opportunities for attracting people in the affordable range, and we have some infill areas with underutilized buildings where this development might work."" Simsbury, too, is considering taking part, and has identified three sites for possible redevelopment as incentive housing zones. The town's planning and zoning commission is focused on the need for entry-level housing, especially for local workers, and is not even factoring in financial incentives, said Hiram Peck, the director of planning. In order to qualify for the incentive program, towns must meet two conditions. At least 20 percent of the housing in an incentive zone must be affordable to households earning no more than 80 percent of the area's median income. The housing zone must also allow for a density of 6 single-family, 10 duplex or 20 multifamily units per acre. The density levels have been a difficult sell in some communities. After considerable study, Wallingford officials balked at a plan to create a mixed-income district in an underdeveloped area downtown. The zone was to take in a six-block swath around a station included as a stop on the planned New Haven-Hartford-Springfield commuter rail line. The plan will very likely come back for reconsideration by the town council, said John LeTourneau, a town councilor and supporter of incentive housing. ""A lot of it was lack of understanding and lack of vision,"" said Mr. LeTourneau, who owns a lamp shop downtown. ""Will this change the community? Yes, it will. But what do we have now? We have nothing. There are some decrepit properties down there. If nothing happens, it's only going to get worse.""

People in North Haven also objected to Mario and Donna DiGioia's proposal to create an incentive housing zone on a 15-acre parcel they own on Middletown Avenue. Owners of abutting properties were staunchly opposed to both the density and the inclusion of affordable housing, according to Ms. DiGioia. So the DiGioias, who are developers, abandoned that idea, and are now proposing new zoning regulations that allow for what they call ""housing opportunity zones."" These would have a reduced density of 4.5 houses (or 6 multifamily units) per acre, and no provision for affordable housing. If this plan is rejected, Ms. DiGioia said, they will submit an application under the state's affordable housing law, which can override local zoning. Yet although some towns are reluctant to embrace higher densities, others appear ready to move ahead with mixed-income zones, partly out of a desire to hold onto the younger generation, said David Fink, the policy director for the Partnership for Strong Communities. ""The towns are coming to grips with the idea that it wasn't just the housing market that changed three years ago -- the world changed,"" Mr. Fink said. ""They recognize that the housing they have may not be the housing they need.""","HOMEConnecticut, a program that provides towns with incentives to build affordable housing, may soon resume after a recessionary hiatus.",8f605fad-9033-5f24-a588-6d0b53b859a1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/10/realestate/10CTZONE_SPAN/10CTZONE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=0b574f061dc42989393d67745c060888f49a160168dfc3bf76d155406c30ecb3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"ON THE MAP  Ferry Crossing, a 16-unit apartment project in Old Saybook, was designed for a broad spectrum of incomes.

He paid $750 to Learning Counts and came out with seven credits at Ottawa University in Kansas, where he would have had to spend $2,800 to earn them in a traditional classroom. And Erin Larson, who has four children and works full time at a television station but wanted to become a teacher, paid $3,000 per semester to Western Governors University for as many classes as she could handle -- plus a weekly call from a mentor. ""Anywhere else, it would have cost three arms and legs,"" said Ms. Larson, 40, ""and as a certified procrastinator, I found that weekly call very useful.""

For those who have the time and money, the four-year residential campus still offers what is widely considered the best educational experience. Critics worry that the online courses are less rigorous and more vulnerable to cheating, and that their emphasis on providing credentials for specific jobs could undermine the traditional mission of encouraging critical thinking. But most experts agree that given the exploding technologies, cuts to university budgets and the expanding universe of people expected to earn postsecondary degrees, there is no end in sight for newfangled programs preparing students for careers in high-demand areas like business, computer science, health care and criminal justice. Chester E. Finn Jr., a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and the president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, predicted that all but the top tier of existing universities would ""change dramatically"" as students regained power in an expanding marketplace. ""Instead of a full entree of four years in college, it'll be more like grazing or going to tapas bars,"" Mr. Finn said, ""with people piecing together a postsecondary education from different sources."" While many students at the nascent institutions offer glowing reviews and success stories, a recent study by Teachers College at Columbia University that tracked 51,000 community college students in Washington State for five years found that those with the most online course credits were the least likely to graduate or transfer to a four-year institution. And traditional professors like Johann Neem, a historian at Western Washington University, see places like Western Governors University as anti-intellectual, noting that its advertising emphasizes how fast students can earn credits, not how much they will learn.

""Taking a course online, by yourself, is not the same as being in a classroom with a professor who can respond to you, present different viewpoints and push you to work a problem,"" Professor Neem said. ""There's lots of porn and religion online, but people still have relationships and get married, and go to church and talk to a minister."" But Anya Kamenetz, whose 2010 book, ""DIY U: Edupunks, Edupreneurs and the Coming Transformation of Higher Education,"" tracks the new wave of Web-based education efforts, says the new institutions will only continue to improve and expand. ""For some people, it will mean going from a good education to a great one,"" she said. ""For others, it will mean getting some kind of education, instead of nothing."" The emerging menu of new offerings is startlingly varied, as are the institutions. One unaccredited nonprofit startup, University of the People, gives English-speaking high school graduates a chance to study business or computers free, with volunteer teachers. There are also budding joint ventures between brick-and-mortar campuses and online entities, like Ivy Bridge College -- a collaboration between Tiffin University, a nonprofit school in Ohio, and Altius Education, a commercial business, offering two-year online degrees transferrable to dozens of partner four-year colleges. And there are grass-roots nonprofits like Peer 2 Peer University, where people start study groups on topics as diverse as JavaScript and Baroque art. Nationwide, almost three quarters of college students attend public institutions, and commercial career colleges like the University of Phoenix and Kaplan now make up almost as much of the remaining quarter as traditional nonprofit private universities like Stanford or Duke. Many of the emerging models are far cheaper than the publicly traded career colleges, some of which have come under scrutiny over the last year for leaving students with mountains of debt and credentials of little value. Most are still new and very small, making it hard to locate students who have used them, other than those referred by the businesses themselves. And it is too soon to know which will take off, or what might come along to overtake them. ""I'm just waiting for a Wikipedia University, with high-quality, online, open-source courses provided by a variety of different people,"" said Richard Vedder, an Ohio University economics professor who directs the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. ""Or the moment when someone like Bill Gates creates Superstar University, finding the best professors for the 200 courses that a good liberal arts college offers, and paying them $25,000 each to put their classes online.""",Some recent entrants into the field of online education offer grounds for both concern and hope.,59c5f69f-568e-5a87-9214-3d8e2faf4f7d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/08/25/education/Future/Future-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=360&w=600&s=26f03b53d0c158ed3c1dc1b9a4c020135296c6aacd5cf1f4ad225a672114b70d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Mariah Long, who got a degree online from Western Governors University while in Germany, went to graduation in Utah.",59c5f69f-568e-5a87-9214-3d8e2faf4f7d,N24News/imgs/59c5f69f-568e-5a87-9214-3d8e2faf4f7d.jpg,22

Automobiles,"Concerns on Jeep Safety Remain, Despite Recall",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/27/automobiles/jeep-safety-still-shadows-fiat-chrysler.html,"DETROIT -- Since its bankruptcy and government bailout in 2009, the American automaker Chrysler has made a stirring comeback primarily by expanding sales of its popular Jeep sport utility vehicles. But even as Chrysler flourishes as part of the newly merged Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, it has been unable to escape lingering concerns about the safety of millions of Jeeps built years ago. At issue are 2.7 million Jeeps with gas tanks placed at the back where, regulators and safety advocates say, they are more likely to explode in a rear-end crash. Now, federal regulators are considering whether to reopen an investigation into those Jeeps, despite Fiat Chrysler's agreement two years ago to recall some of the affected models.

And after successfully settling a number of lawsuits brought by victims of Jeep fires, the company finally went to trial in one such case last month -- and lost in spectacular fashion. A jury in Georgia found Fiat Chrysler responsible for the death of Remington Walden, a 4-year-old boy who was a passenger in a 1999 Jeep Grand Cherokee when it caught fire in an accident in March 2012. The $150 million verdict against the company underscored the enormous potential liability that Fiat Chrysler could face in future Jeep litigation. The case also featured testimony by company officials confirming that Chrysler had stopped making vehicles with gas tanks behind the rear axle like its older Jeeps and marketed models with centrally located fuel tanks as safer.

Mr. Rosekind has said the government is studying reopening its inquiry into Jeep safety. ""He has not taken anything off the table,"" said Gordon Trowbridge, a spokesman for Mr. Rosekind. Since the deal was struck, the death toll has mounted. Regulators linked 56 deaths to the problem when the government closed its investigation two years ago. But since then, several more fatal fires have occurred, including the death in November of a Michigan woman, Kayla White, whose Jeep Liberty exploded in flames after it was rear-ended on a Detroit freeway. ""These crashes will continue unless the investigation is reopened, and we get a new recall,"" said Clarence Ditlow, director of the Center for Auto Safety, which petitioned the government to open its initial safety inquiry in 2009. Agency officials are expected to make recommendations to Mr. Rosekind soon on possible courses of action. Besides reopening the government's investigation, they could also try to force Fiat Chrysler to accelerate its recall of about 1.56 million Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicles, made from 2002 to 2007, and 1993-1998 Jeep Grand Cherokees. The 2013 recall agreement was reached by Fiat Chrysler's chief executive, Sergio Marchionne, and Ray LaHood, who was transportation secretary at the time. The deal called for Fiat Chrysler to install trailer hitches on the recalled vehicles to provide additional protection for gas tanks in the event of a rear-end crash. But Fiat Chrysler said in a recent letter to its dealers that only a small number of the recalled vehicles had been repaired. In the letter on April 13, the company said that 27 percent of the recalled Jeep Liberty sport utility vehicles had been fixed, and only 4 percent of the Jeep Grand Cherokees.

By comparison, in the General Motors ignition switch recall, which began in February 2014, about 70 percent of the 2.6 million older cars have been repaired, the automaker said. ""To date, the recall completion rate for the above-mentioned recalls have not met expectations,"" said the letter from Fiat Chrysler's Customer Services Field Operations office. The company urged its dealers to ""make every effort"" to perform the recall. But Fiat Chrysler still maintains publicly that the affected models are safe to drive. ""The vehicles do not pose an unreasonable risk to safety,"" said Eric Mayne, a company spokesman. Evidence presented in the wrongful-death case involving Remington Walden has, however, raised further questions about the vulnerability of rear-mounted gas tanks in older Jeeps. Despite a recall deal with Fiat Chrysler, few Jeeps like the one involved in the death of Remington Walden, 4, have been repaired. During the nine-day trial, lawyers for the victim's family produced documents showing that only a fraction of vehicles on the market during the 1990s and 2000s had gas tanks behind the rear axle. In fact, Chrysler promoted vehicles with gas tanks in the middle of the chassis as offering extra protection in the event of side or rear impacts.

""There were no gas tanks as vulnerable as these Jeeps',"" said James Butler, a lawyer representing Remington Walden's parents. ""No manufacturer made vehicles with gas tanks that were only 11 inches from the back of the car."" A Fiat Chrysler executive, Gualberto Ranieri, contended on a corporate blog post on April 2 that other vehicles have had similar fuel tanks, but the judge in the Georgia case would not allow that data to be entered as evidence. It was unusual that the case even went to trial. Fiat Chrysler acknowledged in court documents that it had been sued more than 30 times after gas tanks exploded in Jeeps after rear-end crashes. The company settled all previous cases or the litigation was dropped. Fiat Chrysler was also shielded from punitive damages for accidents that occurred after its bankruptcy as part of its Chapter 11 reorganization. A few weeks before the trial in Georgia was set to begin, Fiat Chrysler made a settlement offer to Bryan Walden and Lindsay Strickland, the parents of Remington Walden. The parents refused the offer. ""We never wanted to discuss a settlement,"" Mr. Walden said. ""We wanted people to know what can happen in these accidents so they won't have to go through what we went through."" The jury in the case, precluded from awarding punitive damages, awarded the family $150 million in compensatory damages. Fiat Chrysler has said it is considering an appeal. So far, the safety issues surrounding the older Jeeps have not tarnished the brand. Fiat Chrysler has more than doubled Jeep sales, to more than one million a year, since the Chrysler bankruptcy. And the company is adding new plants in Brazil and China to increase its international sales.","Regulators are considering whether to reopen an investigation into Jeeps with rear gas tanks, despite Fiat Chrysler's agreement two years ago to recall some of the affected models.",25bcf331-86f3-5914-a131-f32d8b73b3db,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/27/business/jeep/jeep-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=4f90273ee36870774722c61e578c352d11eaa728c323c6fb0a01e062bcbab78c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Remington Walden, 4, died in 2012 when the gas tank of his family's Jeep Grand Cherokee exploded in a crash.",25bcf331-86f3-5914-a131-f32d8b73b3db,N24News/imgs/25bcf331-86f3-5914-a131-f32d8b73b3db.jpg,23
Opinion,For Better Data on Hate Crimes,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/22/opinion/letters/hate-crimes-fbi.html,"For nearly three decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation's reporting on hate crimes statistics has consistently provided the most comprehensive snapshot available of bias-motivated criminal activity in the United States. Still, it remains clear that the agency's yearly statistics understate the true number of hate crimes committed in our country.

Underreporting is attributable to numerous factors, including a lack of political leadership, inadequate training and a failure by some agencies to prioritize tracking and to comprehensively identify and record hate crimes.

It is hard to fix a problem without quantifiable data. At a time of rising hate in the United States, Congress must act swiftly on the Khalid Jabara and Heather Heyer National Opposition to Hate, Assault and Threats to Equality Act of 2019 (""No Hate"" Act), a bill named for two recent victims of hate crimes.

The legislation would significantly enhance the accuracy of the F.B.I. statistics by authorizing new funding and support for state and local governments to encourage more robust reporting.

Art & Design,"Up From the Family Basement, a Little-Seen Hamilton Trove",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/09/arts/design/alexander-hamilton-documents-sothebys.html,"Joanne Freeman of Yale and Selby Kiffer of Sotheby's at the auction house with Hamilton documents.

Starting on Wednesday, Hamil-fans will be able to enjoy a double dose of America's newly favorite founding father: a public exhibition of a trove of documents held privately for more than two centuries by descendants of Alexander Hamilton, in a display at Sotheby's designed by David Korins, the set designer for the musical ""Hamilton."" But one morning last month, many of the documents, which will be auctioned on Jan. 18, were spread on a table in a conference room at Sotheby's Manhattan headquarters. Joanne Freeman, a historian at Yale and a leading expert on Hamilton, had come to look through them. Ms. Freeman is a seasoned archive hound, but this was no ordinary day at the office. When Selby Kiffer, an international senior specialist at the auction house, pulled out a simple sheet inside a protective plastic sleeve, she fell into a hush.

""Without this,"" he said, ""we very likely wouldn't be sitting here talking about Alexander Hamilton."" The wild success of the musical has turned the historical A.Ham himself into a cultural celebrity, and sent museums and other institutions into their back rooms, looking for Hamiltonia to show off. The hundreds of documents at Sotheby's, which were consigned by a sixth-generation descendant of Alexander and Elizabeth Hamilton, had been stored in a trunk in the family basement, though some items, like that 1777 commission, had been put on a pedestal of sorts over the years. ""I probably shouldn't say this, but the commission was on my grandfather's bathroom wall for years,"" David Key, a son of the consignor, said in a telephone interview. ""He loved seeing it over the lavatory."" Mr. Key, an agricultural economist who lives in New York City, said that his mother had always taught her children to take pride in their illustrious forebear, but not too much.

""She would always say, 'You know, we come from a real bastard,'"" he said. ""But it wasn't enthroned in our family as some godlike thing."" The commission, which carries an estimate of $150,000 to $250,000, is only one of the emotionally charged high-ticket items in the sale, whose 77 lots are expected to fetch a total of $1.4 million to $2.1 million. There are several passionate early love letters from Hamilton to his wife, Elizabeth, as well as the only known surviving letter to Hamilton from his son Philip, complete with a hole, torn by sealing wax, that eerily evokes the younger man's death in a duel in 1801. And then there's a lock of graying hair snipped from Hamilton's head after his own fatal duel in 1804, which is being sold with a letter of presentation from Elizabeth. When Mr. Kiffer brought it out, Ms. Freeman recoiled slightly, recalling the various ""founder hairballs"" she had been shown over the years, including a particularly mangy sample from the head of the New York grandee George Clinton.

""I shrieked,"" she said. ""It was not taken well."" Hair may be more dramatic, but it's paper -- especially paper that hasn't been fully mined by earlier scholars -- that really gets a historian's heart pumping. Ms. Freeman, who edited the Library of America edition of Hamilton's writings, said she had emailed the auction house ""within nanoseconds"" of hearing about the sale. ""I've read through all 27 volumes of his papers many times,"" she said. ""So just the idea of seeing something I'd never seen before, and all the new puzzle pieces I'd find, was beyond exciting."" The collection, in addition to numerous unpublished family letters, includes previously unrecorded documents by Hamilton, like the manuscript for one of his so-called Pacificus essays. Those were published pseudonymously in Federalist newspapers in 1793 and 1794 as part of a debate with James Madison over whether to remain neutral in the brewing war between revolutionary France and other European powers. There are also Hamilton's notes for Washington's third annual address to Congress, from 1791, dashed off on an envelope-size scrap. ""It's so of the moment,"" Ms. Freeman said, ""like he jotted it down and said, 'Here you go, Mr. President!'""

It's unclear whether the passage was obliterated by Hamilton or by someone else -- like his son John Church Hamilton, who prepared a 19th-century edition of Hamilton's papers that ""suppressed some correspondence,"" Mr. Kiffer said. There is also a group of letters relating to the first of the 10 ""affairs of honor,"" or ritualistic negotiations over insults to one's reputation that did not result in an actual duel, that Hamilton is known to have been involved in. And there are seemingly banal documents that take on a foreboding quality in retrospect, like an anonymous memorandum, sent to one of Hamilton's brothers-in-law in June 1804, describing a recent town meeting in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. Fierce arguments had broken out over whether, should a toast be called for President Thomas Jefferson at the town's Fourth of July celebrations, ""the vice president should also be toasted as such"" -- out of respect for the office, if not for the man himself. In the margin, someone has helpfully penciled in that vice president's name: Aaron Burr. Hamilton's fatal duel with Burr a few weeks later may seem utterly senseless to us now. But it was fought, Ms. Freeman said, out of Hamilton's belief that he needed to preserve his honor so he could lead the country through what he foresaw as an impending crisis of American democracy. Today's partisans do not generally come to physical blows. But Ms. Freeman, whose recently completed book about violence in Congress in the decades before the Civil War will be published next year, said that Hamilton's papers offered a timely reminder that the hard-won norms of American democracy should not be taken for granted. ""People tend to assume the system percolates happily along,"" she said. ""But it sure wasn't percolating happily along here. This was a period where it could have collapsed at any second.""","Before Sotheby's sells a long-held family trove of Alexander Hamilton's documents, the public is invited to take a look.",930dafd6-2a8e-58c5-8250-0dafb388d494,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/10/arts/10HAMILTONJP3/10HAMILTONJP3-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=cf7231fc0564984f91860b4dad4238a314a04f51211386605d7f61f340254950&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A lock of Hamilton's hair, cut the day he died in 1804.",930dafd6-2a8e-58c5-8250-0dafb388d494,N24News/imgs/930dafd6-2a8e-58c5-8250-0dafb388d494.jpg,14

There is a very good chance that you will be as instantly smitten with him as he is with Smize (Schein) in her polka-dotted fit-and-flare dress. (The delightful costumes are by Vanessa Leuck, who also designed the excellent makeup.)

Nerd Face, our bespectacled, argyle-vest-clad hero, has the geek's perennial trouble fitting in. Shunned by Sunny (Jacob Dickey), who is the hotshot leader of the pack -- and, no surprise, a jerk to Smize -- the lonely Nerd Face starts hanging out with Skull (Lucas Steele, deathly pale in black leather and mesh, and oozing an almost Victorian dark charisma). Too naive to be wary, and probably as entranced by his new pal as we are, Nerd Face believes Skull when he says he wants to delete himself, and cooks up a virus to help.

That virus will, alas, come to endanger all of Emojiland. It will be up to Nerd Face to save the realm.

That includes not only the Princess but the dimwitted Prince (a deliciously campy Josh Lamon), also added with the update. Just as shallow as the Princess, he's like a 5-year-old, but very sexual. (""Trust fall!"" he announces, collapsing onto Sunny.) The Princess, the alpha of the two and a hilariously vicious mimic, has an emotional age of about 7. And she can do the splits.","Everybody's on hand, from a variety of Smileys to Nerd Face, and from Princess to Pile of Poo.",285bf6f6-7529-5d11-b37c-28a696b9fb57,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/19/arts/19emojilandpiz1/merlin_167186526_bd47e7c0-a8e3-4715-802e-a804c42eddbc-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c3a4fb4dbcf55cd0e5760f4e033efe5453fe725e4e8df01f880efe5b979a7a27&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, George Abud and Laura Schein as Nerd Face and Smize in the musical ""Emojiland.""",285bf6f6-7529-5d11-b37c-28a696b9fb57,N24News/imgs/285bf6f6-7529-5d11-b37c-28a696b9fb57.jpg,10
Style,Adrian Grenier Pitches Whale Movie With Sundance Party,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/style/adrian-grenier-pitches-whale-movie-with-sundance-party.html,"PARK CITY, Utah -- While the Sundance Film Festival crowd was wondering last Saturday about which films to see and which gifting suites had the best swag, the actor Adrian Grenier had gathered about 100 friends for a candlelit dinner at a private home in Deer Valley, Utah. The occasion was not the coming ""Entourage"" movie in which he stars, but a passion project about a whale.

Or, to be more precise, a documentary that he hopes to have ready by 2017 about what's been called ""the loneliest whale on the planet,"" a creature off the California coast that emits a frequency that no other whale can hear.

""He's been calling out his whole life, and he's never received a response,"" Mr. Grenier said.

His partner in producing the documentary is the filmmaker Josh Zeman. But financing fell through last year, so in addition to a Kickstarter campaign for $300,000 next month, he wanted to spread the word at Sundance.

The sprawling hilltop house, rented by a public relations firm, was filled with musicians, artists and writers from New York and Los Angeles, some of whom swapped their snow boots for stilettos.","The ""Entourage"" star is making a documentary about what's been called ""the loneliest whale on the planet.""",e55377da-3c42-5787-8755-e3baf4093b62,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/29/fashion/29SCENE/29SCENE-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=29ad57484773d2d716900596224def86c13e642013543f96c51f31e8d577ff38&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Adrian Grenier (third from left) and close frends head to the after-party at the Sundance Film Festival following a dinner for his documentary project.,e55377da-3c42-5787-8755-e3baf4093b62,N24News/imgs/e55377da-3c42-5787-8755-e3baf4093b62.jpg,15

Travel,Paris Floods Close Louvre and Other Tourist Attractions,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/03/travel/floods-close-several-tourist-attractions-in-paris.html,"Some of the most popular tourist attractions in Paris, like the Louvre Museum, are temporarily closed to visitors because of heavy rains that have caused the Seine River to rise to its highest levels since 1982. But despite these closures, Myriam Guyon, the founder of the Paris-based travel consultancy Voyages Confidentiels, said that tourists currently in the city aren't lacking in sightseeing options.

""The attractions that are closed are mainly along the Seine River, but the city is fully functioning, and there are dozens of iconic sights that are still open including the Eiffel Tower, the opera house [Palais Garnier] and the Rodin Museum,"" she said.

Below is a current list of what is closed because of the rains. Travelers can visit the official site of the city's Convention and Visitors Bureau for the latest updates. (Updated 6/6/2016)

- The Louvre Museum is closed at least through June 7.

- The Orsay Museum is closed at least until June 7, according to its website.

- The Grand Palais was closed on Friday and Saturday but reopened on Sunday.

-The Paris Sewer Museum is closed until further notice.

- No cruises are currently operating on the Seine.

- Some cafes located along the Seine's quaysides are closed.

- At train and metro stations: according to the Paris Convention and Visitors Bureau, the Saint Michel metro and RER station and the station Cluny La Sorbonne are closed to the public; there is no service on the RER C line in Paris, between the stations Paris Austerlitz, Javel and Avenue Henri Martin.","Because of heavy rains, a number of popular sites in Paris are temporarily closed, including the Louvre and Orsay museums.

Education,Life Beyond Bars: One Man's Journey From Prison to College,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/06/education/edlife/from-prison-to-college.html,"Around midnight on June 30, 1998, Juan Echevarria, a 23-year-old principal in a drug crew, ran into a crack dealer on a Harlem street corner. What ensued, he later told the police, was an argument over money. In those days, Mr. Echevarria would case New York City in a bulletproof vest, often armed with a handgun and sometimes cocaine and cash, overseeing dealers who sold on the streets and in the lobbies of Harlem and Brooklyn apartment buildings. On this night, Mr. Echevarria was cruising for trouble. Hours before, he'd found out his girlfriend had dumped him. He'd just been across the river at Rikers Island on a drug possession conviction. He was feeling hopeless and angry. Pumped with alcohol and mounting rage, he slipped a small revolver out from under his waistband. As the argument heated up, he fired at the dealer, who staggered to his death. Looking back, he can't quite explain what happened. ""It went bad real fast,"" he recalled. Mr. Echevarria pleaded guilty to manslaughter and spent 14 years in prison. Today, at 41, he is desperate to remake himself. Now a sleep-deprived college student, he lugs a textbook-filled backpack around the Midtown Manhattan campus of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, part of the City University of New York, pulling all-nighters, struggling with five-page papers and keeping close tabs on his 3.47 grade-point average. Part of the Prison-to-College Pipeline, a re-entry program that helps incarcerated and formerly incarcerated men in New York City pursue college degrees, Mr. Echevarria dreams of one day graduating. But his challenges have been numerous. He grappled with remedial algebra, required of matriculating CUNY students who can't pass the basic math competency exam. He had to take it four times. Five years in, he is just a sophomore, still 84 credits away from a bachelor's degree, and has accrued $18,000 in student loans.

Money has been a constant source of anxiety. Sometimes he had to rely on friends and family to feed him, and he worried about where he would lay his head at night. He has stayed in seven apartments since his release, in 2012. A day job -- as a case manager helping mentally ill prisoners re-enter society -- has relieved some of the financial pressure, but it has taken its toll emotionally. Exhausted, he tosses and turns on the couch in his mother's public housing unit in East Harlem, where he stays when not at his new girlfriend's apartment, and he wonders: ""Why am I doing this?"" On other evenings, Mr. Echevarria sits in class scribbling copious notes and raising his hand frequently to answer questions, confident he has made the right choice. For a recent anthropology class, he arrived early and positioned himself in the center of the room. Raymond Ruggiero, an adjunct professor, offered up an energetic lecture on the rise and fall of democracy in Latin America, touching on the spread of the Enlightenment, the power structure of banana republics, and the Guatemalan peace activist Rigoberta Menchu. Pausing on the escapades of the Venezuelan leader Simon Bolivar, Dr. Ruggiero grew animated. ""Bolivar's whole idea was about equality, was about freedom, freedom of the mind,"" he told the class. Mr. Echevarria, one of Dr. Ruggiero's favorites, nodded enthusiastically. Later, when the discussion led to how nation states began to regulate themselves once Spanish rulers had left, Dr. Ruggiero asked, ""What did they learn about governance?""

""Juan, excellent work!"" Dr. Ruggiero had scrawled at the bottom of the paper. That put him in good spirits. Much is at stake. With his degree, Mr. Echevarria hopes one day to become a director at the Center for Alternative Sentencing and Employment Services, the nonprofit organization where he works. It's one of the rare places that appreciates an applicant's time behind bars. He plans to major in culture and deviance studies, an academic field heavy on ethnographic perspectives and popular with undergraduates interested in social work, law or the social sciences. Mr. Echevarria's employer has promised a promotion and a big raise if he gets his degree. With the extra income, he would like to settle into a two-bedroom apartment in the Inwood section of Manhattan, removed from the crime-infested neighborhood where he grew up and the drug dealers who remind him of his former life. Without a degree, he worries, opportunities will ""disappear."" ""You want to do this, but it adds a lot of stress,"" he said. ""I've had my ups and downs because of school."" According to the Department of Justice, there were 1.5 million Americans in state and federal prisons in 2014; 636,000 were released. But the number who are likely to stay out -- fewer than a quarter by the five-year marker -- is dispiriting. With widespread consensus that the system is failing both offenders and their victims, state and federal governments are reinvesting in rehabilitative programs. Access to college is one of the most popular. From California to New York, states have announced plans to increase funding. New York is committing $7.5 million to offer classes to 1,000 inmates over the next five years.

The White House has been particularly engaged in the second-chance movement. In May, President Obama urged colleges to eliminate a question on applications about would-be students' criminal history. The question has been found to have a chill effect on applicants with felony convictions. He has also sought ways around a law that bars prisoners from accessing Pell grants. Advocates estimate that there were at least 350 college degree programs for prisoners and the recently released in the early 1980s. But as crime rates skyrocketed and the national mood toward violent offenders turned unforgiving, many of the programs shuttered. Both Democrats and Republicans questioned the spending of higher education dollars on lawbreakers while law-abiding young people struggled with the relatively small sums that federal financial aid offered them. The 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, signed into law by President Bill Clinton, prevents anyone in a state or federal prison from accessing Pell grants. Inmates also can't take out low-interest federal student loans. Last year, President Obama announced an experimental educational program (exempted from regulatory requirements) known as the Second Chance Pell Pilot Program. It is expected to award grants to 12,000 inmates, many of whom began classes this fall; 67 colleges and universities have been chosen to participate, and more than a quarter of them are starting new programs. Higher education behind bars is not free. Some colleges charge inmates regular tuition, or scale it to their prison wages. Others, including John Jay and Bard College, offer them full scholarships. The Bard Prison Initiative plans to expand its well-regarded program, which offers credit-bearing classes to nearly 300 prisoners. The Prison-to-College Pipeline at John Jay, one of the nation's premier criminal justice colleges, currently sends professors to teach for credit classes at Otisville, a medium-security men's prison in Orange County, N.Y. It hopes that with the Pell program, it can add 120 new in-prison students, give inmates the opportunity to get an associate degree while still incarcerated and start a program at the Queensboro Correctional Facility in Long Island City. Baz Dreisinger, a popular English professor and spirited voice in the prison reform movement, founded the Prison-to-College Pipeline in 2011. The program is administered by the Prisoner Reentry Institute, an arm of John Jay dedicated to finding best practices for re-entering inmates. The Pipeline, for male inmates five years or less before their release date, is noteworthy for providing its students with a community both on the inside and on the outside. On release, students are encouraged to transfer to a city campus. So far, 10 have. Once out, the men are offered a host of services by the institute's College Initiative program. The small, tight-knit staff, made up of mostly young prison advocates, advises them -- through workshops, office visits and anxious phone calls -- on financial aid matters, what classes to take, ways to perfect term papers, and how to deal with ornery professors and manage girlfriends, parents and children while trying to hold down jobs.

""Our people have a whole lot more to lose if they don't graduate and a whole lot more to gain by graduating,"" said Vivian Nixon, executive director of the College and Community Fellowship, a nonprofit that funnels dozens of former female prisoners onto college campuses in and around New York City every year. ""It's a natural time of transition and reinvention."" Ruth Delaney, a senior program associate at the Vera Institute of Justice, which oversees its own prison-to-college initiative in New Jersey, Michigan and North Carolina, says that when it comes to factors proven to prevent recidivism, clocking time with other students ""checks all the boxes."" College surrounds people with peers who are motivated and focused. It leaves them little time to fall back into old patterns and helps them build their resumes. And because campuses are ripe with resources -- mental health services, financial counselors, food pantries -- recently released prisoners who arrive on them are near the kind of assistance they desperately need. Indeed, a 2013 RAND Corporation study found that involvement in a prisoner education program reduced a person's odds of returning to prison by 43 percent. Edward J. Latessa, director of the School of Criminal Justice at the University of Cincinnati, has spent years studying programs that work in reducing recidivism. He says most successful programs aren't lofty and philosophical, and they don't involve a lot of talk therapy, yoga or tough-love scare tactics. The best programs, he says, are pragmatic. ""You have to do something about people's difficulties, rather than just talking about them,"" he said. ""You don't just tell them what they need to do, you show them and then you let them do it."" But getting through college is no easy feat. Five years in and only one of the 57 students in the College-to-Prison Pipeline (29 are still in prison) has graduated with an associate degree. No one has obtained a bachelor's degree. And two who have been released have gone back to jail.

To survive in prison, Mr. Echevarria put on the tough, protective veneer that prisoners sometimes refer to as ""the mask."" He learned how to size up a cafeteria to determine who was a threat and how to make a knife out of a toothbrush and shards of metal to protect himself from gang attacks. He landed in solitary on various occasions -- once for talking back to a guard, another time for smoking marijuana. He moved around a lot, from Rikers Island to the Sing Sing Correctional Facility to the Clinton Correctional Facility -- a sign, in the prison world, that he was challenging to maintain. A few years into his sentence, though, while stationed in a maximum-security prison in Ulster County, he made friends with a longtime inmate who was teaching AIDS awareness classes. He signed on, read pharmacology and immunology textbooks, and eventually became an instructor himself. AIDS was still a significant killer, and men flocked to his classes. While teaching, Mr. Echevarria started thinking about his future. He thought about changing. ""I knew I was going to get out. What would I do?"" When he learned about the Prison-to-College Pipeline, he applied immediately. He had a high school equivalency diploma, but had lasted only a few semesters at a community college. Now, though, the idea of pursuing a degree appealed to him. He wrote a three-page essay and sat for the entrance exam. He was transferred to the Otisville prison in 2011 to begin taking classes, some with Dr. Dreisinger. A year later, Mr. Echevarria got the news. It was time for his release -- his ""homecoming.""

Out of class, he worked to avoid old friends and ""business acquaintances"" so he wouldn't ""end up with plans that were not initially mine,"" and he started going to church. He was befriending professors and bonding with administrators at the Prisoner Reentry Institute. But if things looked good on the outside, he was emotionally raw on the inside. ""I was a wreck,"" he recalled. ""Things were a roller coaster."" He struggled to make emotional connections. He and his teenage daughter (now a single mother of a toddler and an infant) texted and saw each other on occasion, but she was not that interested in bonding with him. The relationship he had developed with a woman while in prison, involving long letters about the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, had not translated to the real world, so he moved in with his mother, living blocks from the shooting that had led to his arrest. It was a situational quagmire putting him in contact with all the people recidivism research suggests he should avoid. It was also placing him too close for comfort to old family memories. Mr. Echevarria, whose father left when he was a tween, harbored resentment about his childhood. His mother had worked. He was often supervised by older siblings, and felt abandoned. He recalls being kicked out into the streets for days, as a teenager, after coming home high. His mother recalls warning him about drugs and drug dealing and being worried that she herself might get kicked out of the apartment building if he was involved with illegal substances. Mr. Echevarria moved in with a girlfriend, but that didn't work out either. Some weeks he had only a few dollars to live on. He worried that if he lost his Metro card, he would be in ""crisis mode,"" he said. Once, seeing a young man ruffling through garbage, he thought: I am steps away from that. He was beginning to feel ""the temptation to go back to the old life,"" and the quick and easy cash. It was fleeting. But there. At semester's end, Mr. Echevarria had earned two B's, but he failed algebra. The graphs baffled him. He had trouble remembering what formulas went with what problems. It was a blow to his self-esteem. But it was the rage he felt when things went wrong, lingering from his days behind bars and during his childhood, that seemed to be his most pressing problem.

Mr. Echevarria took a deep breath. ""I really needed that,"" he recalled. Heady and philosophical, Mr. Echevarria remains interested in the thinking patterns -- the self-loathing and propensity for violence -- that landed him in prison. As a result, many of the classes he takes delve deeply into the nature of violence, juvenile delinquency and prison life. They are as much a study of himself as a study of others. What does he most want to learn? How to master his emotions. ""I still have a lot to work on,"" he told me. ""But I'm getting there."" At ease in a dress shirt and a pair of leather lace-ups, Mr. Echevarria hobnobbed with professors, administrators and Manhattan artists at the program's annual dinner at John Jay last spring. Dr. Dreisinger praised a group of John Jay students who had traveled to Otisville regularly to take classes alongside prisoners, a feature of the program that participants, both in jail and out, praise. Prisoners say it builds their confidence and creates bonds with students they can call on, once out. Traditional college students, particularly ones interested in criminal justice careers, say it offers them a bird's-eye view into the life of the kind of people they may soon serve. Dr. Dreisinger acknowledged an inmate who had been released but ended up back inside. She told the diners that the young man was with them in spirit, writing beautiful papers and taking an independent study course with her. ""He's engaged and still very much present in the program,"" she said, sidestepping the heartbreaking reality of the situation. She also paid tribute to Devon Simmons, who landed in jail 16 years ago, convicted of assault and weapon and drug offenses. He was scheduled to graduate a few weeks later with an associate degree, the first to do so. A photo of him in graduation gear was flashed on an oversize screen in the center of the room. This fall, at 35, he is at John Jay pursuing his bachelor's. ""Devon is just opening the door because we have so many other graduations that are going to be coming up in years to come,"" she said. As for Mr. Echevarria, he said he was proud of how his last few semesters had gone. He had finally passed remedial math. He had earned an A in Dr. Ruggiero's class and a B in a criminal justice course taught by a former parole officer. Dr. Dreisinger even needles him about seeking a Ph.D. But he continues to oscillate between big academic dreams and the realities of his life. He talks about opening up a community center, or doing something that doesn't require a degree at all. Then he latches onto the Ph.D. idea.",Juan Echevarria killed a man. He spent 14 years in prison. Now he desperately wants a college degree. Getting one may be the hardest thing he's ever had to do.,697c758c-99bf-5e27-9cfe-4f2b22b93f6e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/06/education/06Prison1/06Prison1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=eab3b5cf4f56a2c5cdc9ef8cefcd4885ff8a0c551d0e068be8b006cc0df1cd27&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Juan Echevarria, a former inmate who is pursuing a college degree, on his mother's couch, where he sometimes has to sleep.",697c758c-99bf-5e27-9cfe-4f2b22b93f6e,N24News/imgs/697c758c-99bf-5e27-9cfe-4f2b22b93f6e.jpg,22
Health,Treatment Offers Hope for Imprisoned California Siblings,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/health/california-13-kids-siblings.html,"The California case in which 13 siblings were found imprisoned at home earlier this week is shocking, but not without precedent. Lurid cases have come to light over the years of children locked in closets and basements, held captive by parents who have crumbled under the weight of drugs, extreme religious conviction, personality disorders or their own abusive backgrounds. The good news, trauma experts say, is that recovery is indeed possible. Victims can reclaim their lives. ""The clinical data is encouraging,"" said John A. Fairbank, co-director of the National Center for Child Traumatic Stress. ""There are good treatments available for children seriously abused and traumatized."" In particular, said Dr. Fairbank, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Duke, good results have been shown with a relatively short-term cognitive behavioral therapy tailored for trauma patients, an approach developed in the early 1990s but widely disseminated in the last 15 years.

A significant hurdle to recovery for the California siblings and children in analogous situations, said psychologists, is that their captors were not stranger-kidnappers but their parents. ""In doing the healing work, you look at what the patient's support systems are, "" said Priscilla Dass-Brailsford, a trauma psychologist and an adjunct professor in the department of psychiatry at Georgetown University. ""The biggest supports are parents and family. These kids don't have that. The parents were the aggressors."" Experts interviewed for this article, who underscored that they had no direct knowledge of the California case, said that because the siblings' primal assurance of unconditional love and safety had been ripped away, they would almost certainly struggle to trust and attach to future supportive figures. ""The notion that this was done by parents increases a child's helplessness and hopelessness,"" said Nora J. Baladerian, a Los Angeles psychologist who often treats traumatized individuals. Dr. Dass-Brailsford compared the 13 siblings' situation to that of prisoners of war, who have been deprived of food, freedom and sufficient nurturing.

""One glimmer of hope is that they did not go through this alone,"" she said. ""Prisoners of war are isolated as part of their torture. These children at least had each other."" Before formal therapy can begin, the siblings must be placed in a safe, nurturing environment where kind treatment will be a positive constant they can rely upon, experts said. They added that keeping as many siblings together as possible would be important, to sustain their bonds.

Daniel L. Davis, a forensic psychologist in Columbus, Ohio who has treated victims and perpetrators and evaluates children for juvenile court, said that there is not one behavioral model that adequately describes a typical parent perpetrator. ""There are risk factors, certainly,"" he said. A list might include a prior history of abuse, domestic violence, and a cluster of personality disorders such as antisocial personality disorder, borderline personality disorder and narcissistic personality disorder. Such people, he said, might be overly emotional, unpredictable, manipulative and exploitative. But like other trauma experts, Dr. Davis emphasized that children can be remarkably resilient. He treated an elementary school-age boy whose parents had kept him locked away for such a long period that the child showed significant developmental delays. ""But with intensive treatment and real effort by a support team, his growth was impressive,"" said Dr. Davis. ""His parents were sent to prison."" Other examples of children locked away from society by parents do occasionally emerge. A documentary ""The Wolfpack"" tells the story of seven siblings isolated in a Lower East Side apartment by their father. In 2015, three siblings were found locked by their parents in a urine-and-feces infested room in Spotsylvania County, Virginia. That same year, a teenage girl in Murfreesboro, Tenn., was also discovered having been locked in her bedroom for months by her parents, who had allowed her three siblings to travel at will.

Dr. Davis said that while poverty is an element in many cases, it is certainly not a signature characteristic; indeed in the California case, the family lived in a middle-class neighborhood and the father, David Allen Turpin, had reportedly once been employed as an engineer. But poverty-afflicted situations may come to light more often, Dr. Davis noted, ""because the perpetrators don't have the resources to keep shielding from public scrutiny."" Formal treatment begins after children are placed in a secure home and assessed for trauma-related symptoms, including post-traumatic stress disorder. They may be unwilling or unable to describe their experience. Nightmares may roil them. The slightest trigger -- the rattle of keys, for example -- might send them into a hysterical tantrum. They may seem hyper-aroused or vigilant, ever alert and cringing, braced to flee or fight. Younger children may act out the trauma as they play; for others, the emotional pain may be so overwhelming that they seem numb. ""But the majority of these children can bounce back, "" said Anthony P. Mannarino, director of the Center for Traumatic Stress in Children and Adolescents at Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh. ""I'm not saying they'll forget it but they can find a way to go forward."" Dr. Mannarino is a co-developer of trauma-focused cognitive behavioral therapy (TF-CBT). The typical treatment, he said, is 12 to 16 sessions. First, a therapist works with a child to manage terrifying thoughts and feelings about the experience. Next a therapist helps the child gradually discuss the trauma. ""Those memories are really scary,"" Dr. Mannarino said. ""Maybe the parents said, 'You deserve what you're getting, it's your fault,' and the child may have internalized shame.

Art & Design,Museum Expansions That Think Inside the Footprint,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/14/arts/design/museum-renovations-frank-gehry-philadelphia.html,"Seeking new audiences looking for novel ways to interact with art, museums big and small across the United States and Europe are remaking their existing footprints, creating new spaces for rapidly unfolding innovation in the art world. The Philadelphia Museum of Art, for example -- whose neo-Classical-style building dates to 1928 -- is undergoing a transformation by Frank Gehry, creator of the Guggenheim Bilbao, which opened to great acclaim in Spain in 1997. ""There are so many vectors now,"" Mr. Gehry said in an interview, describing the need for new kinds of space. ""There's art in the desert. There's art in the skies. There's computers; there's sound; there's light; there's everything."" ""It's not just painting on canvas,"" he said. ""It's a big new world. Think of it as a stage set for whatever somebody's going to come up with.""

His plan for the Philadelphia Museum features 78,000 new square feet of gallery space, including 55,000 square feet that will lie beneath its terrace, abutting the 72 stone steps made famous in the ""Rocky"" movies. It will be used to display special exhibitions and contemporary art. The budget for what the museum is calling the ""core project"" is $196 million. This phase of the work is scheduled to be finished by 2020, while a so-called master plan will take a decade more to complete, at a cost as yet undetermined.

The Frick Collection is working on a new plan, after having met public resistance back in 2013 to a proposed renovation. That design would have eliminated its gated garden on the Upper East Side of Manhattan to accommodate a six-story addition. The new plan by Selldorf Architects, to be unveiled next year, will accommodate growth of the Frick's collections, create new galleries and upgrade its conservation and research facilities, all within what the museum described as its ""built footprint."" Smaller museums are also following suit. In June, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago will complete a six-month $16 million renovation of its Josef Paul Kleihues building, to be overseen by Johnston Marklee. The goal of this plan is to convert 12,000 square feet in the museum into new public spaces -- including a 4,000-square-foot restaurant with decor by the artist Chris Ofili. In Miami, the Bass Museum, which occupies a landmark Art Deco public library, has been undergoing a $12 million renovation since 2015. It is scheduled to be finished in October. Created by the architects Arata Isozaki and David Gauld, who designed the museum's first (2001) expansion, the new plan increases usable space by almost 50 percent, largely by eliminating a two-story ramp that connected its original building and a wing built in 2001.

One key feature of Mr. Chipperfield's Royal Academy design is reconstruction of the original lecture theater at 6 Burlington Gardens, while the plan for the American Museum of Natural History involves either renovation or replacement of 75 percent of its classrooms. Similarly, the space devoted to education at the Bass will quintuple, to 5,000 square feet, while the Frick will build its first spaces and classrooms dedicated to that purpose. Many of these institutions are also undoubtedly responding to changes in the reasons people visit museums. According to a survey released in 2015 by the National Endowment for the Arts, 73 percent of Americans say they attend cultural performances or museum exhibitions to socialize with friends and family, while 64 percent hope to learn new things, and 51 percent want to support their communities. Speaking recently in New York, Madeleine Grynsztejn, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Chicago, said: ""The pendulum has swung from the museum as passive temple to the museum as active space, from a treasure box to a toolbox. Today's audiences are no longer looking for a cold 'white cube' museum experience. Instead, they crave warmer, shared experiences."" To that end, her museum's renovation includes a 2,000-square-foot commons on its second floor, created by the Mexican design studio Pedro y Juana. Ms. Grynsztejn described it as a ""winter garden for all seasons,"" one that will be a multiuse space for community activities and interactions with artists. And Christopher Le Brun, a painter, royal academician and the academy's president, said: ""More and more of the public wants to engage with, encounter art and artists. They want to take part. Our spaces will make that easier for them."" Arthur Cohen, chief executive of LaPlaca Cohen -- a New York consulting firm that advises museums, including the Philadelphia Museum and the Frick, and other cultural institutions -- suggested that museums were opting to grow within their own footprint now ""because at this moment in time, the idea of a grand, flamboyant architectural gesture seems unseemly, quite tone-deaf.""","Need 55,000 square feet of new display space?

Dance,"Jennie Somogyi's Last Steps, After All It Took to Get to Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/10/arts/dance/jennie-somogyis-last-steps-after-all-it-took-to-get-to-them.html,"During her career at New York City Ballet, Jennie Somogyi, a dancer prized for her steely strength and lush musicality, has sustained just three injuries, but they've been whoppers. By now, she knows what it means when she hears the dreaded pop of a tendon. The most recent one occurred during the Russian dance in a 2013 performance of ""Swan Lake"" and affected the same tendon, in her left foot, that she had torn years before.

The first time, in 2004, her doctors removed half of the tendon to fix it and told her that it would be impossible to repair if she hurt it again. Flash forward to 2013: ""I'm in my bikini top from 'Russian,' "" Ms. Somogyi (pronounced sum-OH-gee) said, ""and I'm lying on the ground thinking, well, this was my last show."" (A year before, she tore her Achilles' tendon in her right foot.)

Dancing wasn't the primary problem; Ms. Somogyi, 38, wasn't sure if she would be able to walk normally again. At first doctors recommended a tendon transfer: taking her flexor hallucis longus tendon and putting it in the place of the posterior tibial tendon. ""I would have been limited in general,"" she recalled during an interview at the David H. Koch Theater. ""The way they described it to me was I wouldn't have function of my little toes. So I would not have control of part of my foot. I was just like, no. I'm too young.""

But with the help of a donor tendon and a year and a half of rehabilitation, Ms. Somogyi was able not only to walk but also to return -- however gingerly -- to City Ballet, starting last spring in a cool, stark pas de deux from Balanchine's ""Episodes."" She added his ""Liebeslieder Walzer,"" a ballet she never thought she'd be able to dance again, to her repertory for the fall season. On Sunday, it will be her farewell performance.","After a long, difficult recovery from a torn foot tendon, Ms. Somogyi, a New York City Ballet principal dancer, will make her farewell performance on Sunday.",46c7d7d1-8104-5f0e-a14c-169b8b4cb4f2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/10/10/arts/10SOMOGYI/10SOMOGYI-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=b1697d2cbcf7389b0f02b3934cdfd81e47249ade6386f77887f84e92e181b5f0&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jennie Somogyi, principal dancer with New York City Ballet, rehearsing ""Episodes"" with Craig Hall.

Opinion,Who Says It's Not Safe to Travel to China?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/05/opinion/china-travel-coronavirus.html,"The United States State Department is denying entry to foreign nationals who have recently been to China, is screening American citizens who arrive home from China as well as asking them to self-quarantine for 14 days. It has told American citizens not to visit the country at all. Major airlines including British Airways, Lufthansa and all three major American carriers have halted all flights to China, while the cruise line Royal Caribbean is denying boarding to any person who has traveled to, from or through China or Hong Kong in the past 15 days. Travel companies such as those airlines are motivated both by pressure from employees and by the falling demand for flights. Flying empty planes to and from China is, after all, not profitable.

But what has motivated the response from governments? It doesn't appear to be evidence. Measures like screening at airports, quarantining cruise ships or flights with confirmed cases and isolating communities at the center of an outbreak can be effective, said Erin Sorrell, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University who studies emerging infectious diseases. However, she and other experts say the available evidence suggests that total border shutdowns are not an effective means of containment of respiratory viruses. Resources are better used, she argued, treating sick patients and developing vaccines and other countermeasures.

Sadly, one doesn't have to look far for evidence of these top-down decisions morphing into outright racism within the general population, a trend that has a long history in the narrative of outbreaks such as this one.

Coronavirus shares something in common with other kinds of civil disruption, natural disasters or emergencies that affect localized travel industries: Its destructive power lies not in the actual risk but in the perception of that risk. Numerous experts have said that the majority of people who contract coronavirus will experience it as a respiratory infection they will fully recover from. But the extreme reactions -- the canceling of flights, closing of borders and level-four travel warnings -- seem more appropriate for something much worse.

Therein lies a familiar unfairness. When it comes to travel, the perception of risk is rarely meted out objectively. Consider the level-two travel warning imposed by the State Department last month in the wake of the continuing Australian wildfires. It advised travelers to consider postponing their trips because of extremely poor air quality and the threat of evacuation in the monthslong fires. Just a few days later, it was reduced to level one, reportedly in response to the direct appeal of Prime Minister Scott Morrison to the Trump administration. Similarly, in the 2017-18 flu season, when the United States had a particularly bad outbreak, the respiratory virus resulted in an estimated 61,000 deaths and 45 million symptomatic cases -- but no travel warnings.",The coronavirus travel ban is unjust and doesn't work anyway.,cd506919-1e75-5f8e-b733-d22ec101ad59,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/05/opinion/05Spinks/05Spinks-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=01f15df5487d0f8488d8172f14efaae5481fa0b178da176a0f22f42a1f902c74&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A Chinese family, whose flight to Shanghai was canceled after the Philippine government imposed travel restrictions to and from China, on Monday at the airport in Manila.",cd506919-1e75-5f8e-b733-d22ec101ad59,N24News/imgs/cd506919-1e75-5f8e-b733-d22ec101ad59.jpg,11
Real Estate,"For Hard-Hit Seniors, Rental Options",https://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/01/realestate/for-westchester-seniors-rental-options-from-wartburg-adult-care-community.html,"ON a fixed income, Antonio and Nan LaGuidice struggle to meet the $1,700-a-month rent for their two-bedroom apartment in New Rochelle, and the costs of doctor visits, cancer treatments and medication that Mrs. LaGuidice, 72, requires. The couple, who share their place with an adult daughter, manage only by cutting costs so close to the bone that Mr. LaGuidice, 90, a former building superintendent and school bus driver who needs a hearing aid, cannot spare the money for one. ""We're stretched way beyond our limit financially and don't know which way to turn,"" said Mrs. LaGuidice, explaining that even with Medicare, the co-payments on their mounting medical needs are straining their resources to the point that they now need to sharply reduce their housing costs. One promising lead on a way to do that has come from the Wartburg Adult Care Community, a Mount Vernon facility that began as an orphanage in 1866 and started serving the elderly in 1972. Among other things, it has 31 cottages designed for independent living and rented at market rate, as well as a dementia center and a nursing home, on 36 acres. But the LaGuidices are particularly interested in one of the Wartburg's new projects, financed by a state grant of $27.59 million, which include an expanded effort to help older people remain in their homes, as well as 60 units of affordable housing and a new day care center for the elderly.

The money is part of a first round of state grants awarded under the Healthcare Efficiency and Affordability Law, totaling $150 million, announced in 2010 and destined for nine adult care organizations in New York. The Wartburg's grant is the third-largest in the state and one of two awarded in Westchester County. United Hebrew of New Rochelle received $2.5 million, and will use the money to help pay for a dementia care unit. The largest award, $33,975,508, was given to Samaritan Medical Center in Watertown, Jefferson County, for a variety of construction projects. In all, $450 million will be available ""to eliminate excess bed capacity and reduce overreliance on inpatient care in hospitals and nursing homes,"" according to the state Department of Health. The intent is to reduce state Medicaid costs. The new units at the Wartburg, scheduled to open early next year, will benefit people like Mr. and Mrs. LaGuidice and Norine Christian, 68, a Mount Vernon resident who shares a cramped rent-controlled two-bedroom apartment with her 3-year-old grandson and a son and daughter-in-law, both of whom recently lost their jobs. Ms. Christian, a retired postal clerk, says she can barely carry the costs for all of them on her pension of $2,600 a month. Her landlord has informed her that the rent on the apartment, now $850 a month, will increase as soon as the housing no longer falls under rent-control guidelines. She is not sure when that will be, but two-bedroom units newly rented in her building go for $1,700 and up. Both Mr. and Mrs. LaGuidice and Ms. Christian are typical of those who will very likely apply to move to the Wartburg's apartments.

The Wartburg will officially start accepting applications for the units later this year, according to David Gentner, its president. The units, which will be ready for residents early next year, will be assigned on a first-come, first-served basis, although factors like income eligibility will be considered, he said. Mr. and Mrs. LaGuidice, for example, would pay about $775 for a one-bedroom unit; the amount reflects the fact that their current income is 40 percent of the area's median of $86,350 for a family of two, said Ryan Herchenroether, director of planning. For them, the reduction in rent will mean ""more money to put gas in the car so we can visit family, get to our doctors and catch up on our bills,"" Mrs. LaGuidice said. Her husband, she added, may now be able to get a hearing aid. Ms. Christian said she was looking forward to having a place of her own. ""I need a little room for myself and freedom from all this responsibility,"" she said. Nancy Davis, a spokeswoman for the Wartburg, explained that even though many older adults have pressing medical needs and require assistance with daily tasks, ""that does not necessarily mean they are ready for a nursing home."" One alternative is represented in the Wartburg's new affordable units, the other in its adult day care center, which is to begin construction in the next few months. The elderly are often better served, Ms. Davis said, if they can remain at home, taking advantage of the center and receiving help from social workers on a range of services, including eviction prevention. James W. Clyne Jr., the president of LeadingAge New York, a nonprofit advocacy organization near Albany, applauded the emphasis on helping more older adults live as independently as possible. Of the Wartburg's plans for affordable housing, he said, ""We're hoping for more projects like this."" That is precisely the direction the Wartburg is heading in, said Mr. Gentner, explaining that it was establishing a development corporation to fill the need for more such housing throughout southern Westchester County. ""For us,"" Mr. Gentner said, ""this first project is just the beginning.""","The Wartburg Adult Care Community in Mount Vernon is planning more affordable housing units, a new elderly day care center and expanded efforts to help older people remain in their homes.",a7f016c8-c2fe-5683-a875-bf218c38dd4d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/04/01/realestate/01WEZONE_SPAN/01WEZONE_SPAN-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=340&w=600&s=7a12173cdc34631ba885470d6d2956ebbafd31732b0c5829f055fdce54de26be&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,ADDITION  A rendering of apartments for low-income senior citizens planned by the Wartburg Adult Care Community in Mount Vernon.,a7f016c8-c2fe-5683-a875-bf218c38dd4d,N24News/imgs/a7f016c8-c2fe-5683-a875-bf218c38dd4d.jpg,7

Technology,'The Effects Cannot Be Overstated': When Tech Invaded Media,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/technology/personaltech/media-tech-effects.html,"How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? Jim Rutenberg, media columnist for The Times, discussed the tech he's using. Tech and media have long been converging. What are the biggest effects on the media industry, and how has it had to adapt? The effects cannot be overstated -- and in some ways, everything is changing, which is what makes it so exciting to cover. First there's streaming, which has blown apart the television model that I started covering 20 years ago. The traditional networks are under siege, and that, in turn, is breaking up the longstanding Hollywood power structure -- and the old boys' network behind it -- in welcome ways. The amount of quality programming is off the charts, and opportunities for newcomers with new ideas and backgrounds are unparalleled in the history of the moving image.

The question is what the new power structure will look like. Will it be more reflective of America and continue to tell better stories about it? Or will it be meet the new boss, same as the old boss? In journalism, it's a mixed bag. The giant sucking sound you hear is Silicon Valley vacuuming the digital ad dollars out of the news business, badly hurting small and midsize newspapers across the country. This is now a given, but I'll say it again anyway: As newspapers fall, leaving important local issues uncovered, the social media companies contributing to their deaths are helping to fill the content void with unverified, and at worst patently false, information. Solutions are not coming fast, though smart people are working on it. At the same time, the digital transformation has introduced supercool ways of telling stories and given the industry a new dynamism from a new talent pool. At the end of the day, though, the basics still rise: penetrating, holy-smokes reporting in stories well told. How do you consume media now? Which gadgets or tech services do you use most often? I am so addicted to my iPhone that my fingers hurt. My distal interphalangeal joints -- the ones toward the tips of my digits -- take it particularly hard, though they are probably so strong by now they could lift a VW Bug. I'm a 6s-type person, and if I didn't have the iPhone battery case I'd be dead in the water by noon every day (especially when dealing with sensitive sources via battery-eating encrypted apps).

That said, I've balanced my follows such that Twitter and, secondarily, Facebook still do a fairly good job of serving up content I wouldn't have otherwise noticed (So I won't delete my accounts -- yet). With friends who are less social media oriented, I remain an evangelist for a well-curated feed, though I include a trigger warning: The dreck that inevitably works its way into the stream can ruin your day (or your democracy), as the world now knows. I find that Instagram is a good antidote, and I keep mine personal, and away from work.

I start the morning on my iPad, where I peruse Flipboard and the traditional newspaper apps: The Times's, The Wall Street Journal's, The Washington Post's and those of various local news organizations (The Palm Beach Post, The Texas Tribune, Philly.com ), especially when I'm traveling. I'm using Apple TV more and more, and am constantly toggling between my content on Apple, Amazon Prime, Netflix and the cable box. I've yet to figure out the remotes; I just push buttons until stuff turns on. Spotify is a constant in my life, and it's what I usually use on my Sonos home speaker system as well. What could be better about the tech tools you rely on most for your beat? Among all their downsides, the news algorithms of Twitter and Facebook do a lousy job serving up items that aren't directly in the trending hurricane du jour. It would be great if they could be more like Spotify, which has developed a very good formula for finding songs and bands you have never heard of but will probably like -- with curveballs thrown in that run counter to your taste, in case you're up for expanding your repertoire. It may be easier to do with music, which calms the savage beast, than with words and pictures, whose power to enrage has only grown.

Also, the platforms simply have to do a better job of identifying and eradicating bots whose sole mission appears to be to inflame and harass. Yes, they target all sorts of users, but in some cases (and in the parochial terms of my beat) they're aimed at journalists -- either to sway them or to just attack them, in another affront on democracy's fourth estate. Don't get me started on misinformation. I have too many columns ahead to fill on the topic. What tech product are you personally obsessed with? I'm going to cheat and talk about two. And it won't be pretty. Let's start with Nest. The device -- at least ours, which we got two years ago -- has a mind of its own. At times, it makes me feel as if I'm in the ""Jetsons"" reboot episode in which the robots all turn against George. My wife and I are often away from our house for long periods, so we keep the heat low. The Nest allows us to warm it from afar hours ahead of time so we don't come home to an icebox. But then, for no apparent reason, the Nest will set the heat back to low when we're in the house so it is suddenly freezing again. This has happened in exceedingly cold weather when there are pipes to worry about. The device is running on an algorithm that we can turn off -- I get that (theoretically, at least; my m.o. with tech is to figure out the minimum that will serve my needs and leave it at that). And I'm sure there are other ways to fix it. The other day I hit up against a new and unforeseen problem -- it went totally dead on me just as a cold snap kicked in. I forgot to pay the internet bill. I know one thing: My old thermostat was immune to my own idiocy, didn't play games with me or jeopardize my plumbing and I didn't need to pore through a manual to figure it out. We are giving it one more chance before we ditch it.

Ditto Sonos. The stereo speakers are wireless and portable, so you can play music throughout your house from your iPhone, without having to hire a contractor to embed speakers in your walls or sell you some fancy and expensive system. But often -- usually when we're throwing a dinner party -- the speakers will stop playing as the app goes on the fritz for prolonged periods without obvious reason. (And customer support isn't all that supportive.) That never happened with my old Sony hi-fi. One more ruined playlist during a party and I'm out.

What's one app you can't live without? Surfline. It's not the only app to give you surf conditions and predictions, and it's not the only good one. But its easy-to-digest ratings -- ""good,'' ""fair,'' ""poor"" -- are great for committed surfers with the unfortunate affliction of a day job. The app offers plenty of data and has a wealth of surf cams from breaks around the world, so you can see the swell before you go -- or stare longingly at your home break when you're in another meeting and your editor's all, like, blah, blah, blah.

Television,"'Here and Now' Season 1, Episode 7: Harsh Realms",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/arts/television/here-and-now-recap-wake.html,"Ramon and Farid are getting into numerology. In the session that opens this week's episode, ""Wake,"" Ramon announces that he is quitting work on his video game, ""Realms,"" and his doctor beseeches him to continue. ""I want you to think of your game -- specifically, the artistry of your game -- as a part of your healing process,"" Farid says. But he has a hidden motive: He has discovered uncanny parallels between the world Ramon is creating and his own traumatic childhood in Iran. When Farid works himself into a numerological frenzy, connecting the address of his building, the number of his office suite and the nine groups of 11 butterflies in the game to 11:11, it's clear he's at least as far gone as Ramon is.

As a low-level arithmophobic, I won't pretend to have followed Farid's every mathematical leap. But even I have caught on to a simpler numerical pattern in the first season of ""Here and Now"": Every three episodes, toward the end of the hour, Ramon has a vision. In the premiere, it was the candles. Episode 4 closed with the sequence in the abandoned building, where he saw his birth mother. So, in Episode 7, when the sight of someone wearing a surgical mask at the game expo seems to bring on Ramon's screaming, trembling, possibly career-killing hallucination of a horde of masked, dust-covered people shuffling toward him like zombies, it fits the pattern.

The scene is somewhat novel, in that it's the first of Ramon's visions (or dreams) that isn't tied in any obvious way to his birth family, Farid's past or 11:11. There's something post-apocalyptic about the apparitions he sees, which also bring to mind the folkloric spirits known as ""haints"" that Jamila's family discusses over dinner. Even so, watching Ramon get scared out of his wits by a hallucination every time things seem to be going well for him is starting to get old.

Seven episodes in, he's not the only character whose story line is becoming redundant. I know that I complain about Ashley and Duc every week, but every week it gets more frustrating to watch the show keep hammering home the same points about them. In ""Wake,"" Ashley questions her marriage to a white man, meets Jamila's mom and continues to stew about her own adoptive mother's accidental, televised defense of white supremacy -- all plot points that push her another few inches in the direction of some inevitable revelation about her racial identity.",This week it was clear that Farid is at least as far gone as Ramon is.,7305b63e-a17e-5f5a-b80e-177e13bda7dc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/23/arts/25hereandnow-recap/25hereandnow-recap-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fbf62424e8689885a28b5f5ff2d8b6f653054e9caccc88a42aba153e20c3a359&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Holly Hunter in ""Here and Now.""",7305b63e-a17e-5f5a-b80e-177e13bda7dc,N24News/imgs/7305b63e-a17e-5f5a-b80e-177e13bda7dc.jpg,3
Style,Black Germans Say It's Time to Look Inward,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/04/style/black-germans-say-its-time-to-look-inward.html,"BERLIN -- In June, when Jelisa Delfeld joined a Telegram channel to help organize a silent demonstration against racism in Stuttgart, Germany, she was one of fewer than two dozen members. The next day, that number grew to 100, and the following, about 1,000 people had joined the channel where the protest was being planned. ""When the video of George Floyd being killed came out, it was also shocking in Germany,"" said Ms. Delfeld, 24. ""Even though it happened in the U.S., it's a Black man, and we're Black. If there's pain in our community, you can feel that pain everywhere."" Over five days of Zoom meetings, calls and texts, this group of young strangers, most of whom had little experience in activism, organized a demonstration that brought between 7,000 and 10,000 people into the streets of Stuttgart, a city of roughly 620,000, on June 6.

Despite the overwhelming public show of solidarity in June and July, many activists in Germany said that Germans seemed more eager to support Americans than to look inward. In the last few years, Germany has been criticized by the United Nations and the European Union for racial profiling and police violence. And while the country is known worldwide for its ""culture of remembrance"" around the Holocaust, German textbooks and mainstream history narratives largely ignore its colonial history. Many Black people in Germany say that they do not feel a sense of belonging, and that their presence here has been rendered practically invisible. ""The assumption is that if you're Black, you are not, nor will you ever be, German,"" said Angelo Camufingo, 28, one of the organizers of the group Black Lives Matter Berlin. Part of it, many Black Germans say, has to do with a culture of denial around racial discrimination. ""There was solidarity with the protesters,"" said Julia Wissert, 36, the artistic director of the Dortmund Theater in western Germany, who, with a lawyer, developed an anti-racism clause for theater contracts in 2018. ""At the same time, there is the imagined idea of racism being an American problem because America always had issues with racism due to slavery.""

Ms. Wissert described racism in Germany as a mist. ""You can't really see it if you stand in it, but you experience it if you stand in it because it makes you hyper-visible and invisible at the same time,"" she said. Though Germany doesn't maintain data on racial demographics because of the atrocities of the Nazi era, it does document where migrants arrive from. By that count, about one million of the country's residents have roots in Africa, though the actual number is likely higher. Organizations that research Germany's colonial history have traced the presence of people from the African continent as far back as the early 1700s. ""Black communities in Germany are so diverse,"" said Siraad Wiedenroth, 33, who sits on the board of the Initiative for Black People in Germany, in a phone interview. ""There are Black people here in the second, third and fourth generations. There are people who arrived 10 years ago via guest worker visas or to study, Black people here who sought refuge."" Artists have worked to bring visibility to Germany's nonwhite populations. Last year, working together with local youth, Ms. Wissert created a play in Bochum called ""2069: The End of Others."" Experiences with racism came up repeatedly through stories her teenage collaborators told about their lives. ""They know something is wrong, that they're being treated differently,"" she said. Rhea Ramjohn, 36, one of the founders of Black Brown Berlin, a digital platform that connects Black and brown people, said: ""The history of Black people in Europe and Germany is often a narrative that they were never here. We were never here. We just arrived here. We are all refugees."" The platform showcases Black-owned businesses and produces anti-discrimination events. One of its projects is a series of portraits of Black and brown people along with their interpretation of the phrase ""We Are Here.""

This summer, cultural institutions reached out to Black artists to commission work in response to the global unrest. Black Brown Berlin was approached in July by Haus der Kulturen der Welt, a prominent museum in the capital, to produce a piece for a digital series on racism during the pandemic. The result was a short film that pairs a spoken-word poem with visuals of dancers performing spontaneous movement in the Grunewald forest in Berlin, where Audre Lorde would walk with mentees and friends, including the activist May Ayim, during the years Ms. Lorde lived in Berlin. The poem includes references to the ""mothers of the movement,"" those whose Black children were killed by police, and ""I can't breathe,"" a phrase that has taken on sharper significance during the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately affected people of color. Femi Oyewole, 31, one of Black Brown Berlin's founders, said that many of Germany's demonstrations suggested that racism was ""an American issue. Like, 'Germany's fine, we don't have this issue.' But people here were tired. What about people here in Germany who suffered at the hands of the police?"" ""When I was growing up and thinking about being Black, it was so shaped by the U.S.,"" said Ciani-Sophia Hoeder, 30, a founder of RosaMag, an online lifestyle magazine for Black women in Germany, Switzerland and Austria. ""Anti-Black racism was always something people thought the U.S. or U.K. or France have, but not Germany,"" Ms. Hoeder said. ""We don't talk about police brutality.""

Some monitoring bodies have been trying to change that. In 2017, the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent reported that while the German constitution guarantees equality and prohibits race-based discrimination, ""it is not being enforced."" The report also said that the lives of people of African descent ""are marked by racism, negative stereotypes and structural racism"" as well as ""racist violence and hate crimes."" The report lists several examples of racial discrimination and violence that were not properly investigated, including the death of Oury Jalloh, an asylum seeker from Sierra Leone who burned to death while tied to a bed in police custody in Dessau in 2005. Since 2005, a group of friends and family has uncovered various inconsistencies in the police's version of events surrounding his death. For example, Mr. Jalloh did not have a lighter with him when he was admitted, but one was found later in the fire rubble bag. An independent examination of Mr. Jalloh noted that he had fractures all over his body. The mattress he was tied to was fire resistant. In 2018, the state parliament in Saxony-Anhalt tasked two investigators with re-examining the details of Mr. Jalloh's death. This summer, Der Spiegel reported on the resistance the investigators have run into. The report from the U.N. also described racial profiling in Germany as ""endemic."" A report from the European Commission Against Racism and Intolerance last year emphasized that in Germany, ""though there is strong evidence for extensive racial profiling, numerous police services and representatives are unaware of or do not admit its existence.""

""We have no racism problem in the police here,"" Thomas Blenke, the interior minister for the state of Baden-Wurttemberg said in a news release. Some politicians say that racial profiling does not exist in Germany because discrimination is banned by the constitution. But rules of police conduct allow police officers to stop and search people without suspicion in trains or in train stations all over the country or in ""criminal hot spots."" According to Die Zeit, Horst Seehofer, the minister of the interior, canceled a planned study into racial profiling because there is ""no need"" for it. (A spokesperson for the minister said that he commissioned a study on ""right-wing extremism in security authorities"" that will be completed this month.) Mr. Seehofer recently criticized a new law in Berlin that allows people who have been discriminated against by representatives of ""the state,"" such as police officers, teachers and judges, to seek damages and compensation, calling it ""basically madness,"" in an interview with the German newspaper Der Tagesspiegel. He added that ""there is no justification for questioning the integrity of our police officers in such a structural way."" This summer, Mr. Seehofer, who is on a new government committee against right-wing extremism and racism, threatened to file a criminal complaint against Hengameh Yaghoobifarah, 28, a journalist who had written a satirical column that criticized the police after the peak of the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States and abroad. Two German police unions filed lawsuits against Mx. Yaghoobifarah. After pushback from various sources, including from a petition signed by more than 1,000 people, Mr. Seehofer backtracked. Mx. Yaghoobifarah found out last week that 150 lawsuits that had been filed because of the column were being dropped. Mx. Yaghoobifarah and Fatma Aydemir, 33, the editors of a recent book of essays on racism, spoke about the reluctance in Germany to address the root of the violence against Black people.

""On all the talk shows in which Black Lives Matter was discussed, there was a hesitation to talk about the German police,"" Ms. Aydemir said. ""And whenever a person did that on a popular or mainstream platform, they always invited someone from the police or a politician very close to the police, or three of them even, to destroy this argument."" Mx. Yaghoobifarah said: ""They would, for example, say the police training in Germany is way longer than in the U.S., so people are more skilled here or they would say the history of the prison industrial complex and anti-Black racism in the U.S. is different than in Germany. And of course, it is different, but it doesn't mean that Germany is doing well.""

""Many people in Germany have not thought about anti-Black racism or could afford not to think about it,"" Mr. Kopp said. ""There has been a long history of oppression and repression here, and a struggle for equal rights."" Berlin Postkolonial, another group Mr. Kopp is part of, has been giving similar tours for 15 years. ""In the beginning we did three tours a year,"" Mr. Kopp said. ""Now it's 50."" He said that more and more teachers have been requesting tours for their students. Before, the tour groups mostly consisted of young adults curious about part of history that had been skipped over in school. ""History is a construction,"" Ms. Yeboah said. ""We need to know it to shape our future. It's the only way you can move forward in a better direction.""","The Black Lives Matter movement saw shows of solidarity around the world this summer. In Germany, some feel there is a reluctance to acknowledge more local problems.",e248d34e-82c6-5867-a048-53e5d24037ed,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/04/fashion/02BLM-GERMANY1/02BLM-GERMANY1-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=b1f2fc1350272c124af776b63c6c5cf0acee82edbcc7141818389a7cb1b312ec&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At least 15,000 people gathered to protest racism in Berlin on June 6.

Opinion,"Seriously, Just Wear Your Mask",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/02/opinion/coronavirus-masks.html,"Seriously, just wear one. Almost any mask will do, really. N95, surgical, spandex, homespun cotton. For people who aren't front-line health care workers, what matters is whatever you can get your hands on that fits over your nose and mouth. As the nation plunges for a second time into the depths of this brutal pandemic, officials worry we'll soon have as many as 100,000 new cases every day. Summer won't save us. Neither will bluster or bleach. It's easy to want to give up, but it would be wrong. Wearing a mask is not only simple and cheap, it's also proved to be effective in slowing the virus's spread. It will protect the health and even save the lives of your loved ones, your neighbors and people you don't know. This isn't hard. If the lower half of your face is not covered when you go out in public, stop searching for excuses and go mask up.

Or think about it as the best path to economic recovery. If all Americans were required to wear masks in public, we could reduce the number of daily cases to a level that would otherwise require lockdowns that would slash nearly 5 percent, or $1 trillion, from the nation's gross domestic product, according to an analysis released this week by Goldman Sachs. Or, if you like, think about it as a gesture of patriotism as we mark a stark and somber Independence Day. But please, just don't think about it as so many Republicans do. ""Mask-wearing has become a totem, a secular religious symbol,"" Alex Castellanos, a longtime Republican strategist, told The Washington Post. ""Christians wear crosses, Muslims wear a hijab, and members of the Church of Secular Science bow to the Gods of Data by wearing a mask as their symbol, demonstrating that they are the elite; smarter, more rational, and morally superior to everyone else.""

This is a bizarre way to talk about people who are guided by facts, science and reason. It's not about making a political point or asserting moral superiority; it's about saving lives and protecting one another -- which should be a basic element of citizenship in any democracy. And yet, like so many seemingly nonpolitical topics, donning a mask has become partisanized to the point that people are brawling in supermarkets over their right to infect others. ""It's a free country; I can do what I want"" sounds charming when it comes from a child. It can be far worse when it is shouted from the mouth of a possibly infected adult. It's a strange sort of freedom that includes exposing other people to a potentially deadly virus. What's to resist about showing respect to your fellow Americans? Why turn a straightforward public health issue into a political one? The virus doesn't care whether you're a Republican or a Democrat. It ravaged blue states in the spring, and now it's plowing through red ones. All it cares about is finding open mouths and nostrils. It's crazy that we are having this debate after all. Dozens of countries have already mandated mask-wearing in public. It's not a coincidence that the United States remains the world's coronavirus hot spot. Only recently -- as the virus descends on the places where their political supporters live -- have some top Republicans come to their senses. On Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas, whose state is currently being overwhelmed with new cases, issued a statewide mask mandate. (Indoor churchgoers are exempted, but outdoor protesters aren't.) There have been encouraging words from the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, Vice President Mike Pence, even Sean Hannity. Earlier this week, Steve Doocy, a host of ""Fox & Friends,"" which has as direct a line to President Trump's brain as any top White House adviser, pleaded with the president to ""set an example"" and wear a mask. MAGA should now stand for ""Masks Are Great Again,"" he said. We're not holding our breath. Even with records being set daily, the White House refuses to issue a nationwide face mask mandate. Some resisters are still sore about the contradictory or incorrect messages about masks that came from health officials in early days of the pandemic. In late February, Surgeon General Jerome M. Adams tweeted: ""Seriously people -- STOP BUYING MASKS! They are NOT effective in preventing general public from catching #Coronavirus."" Anthony Fauci said a version of this a few days later. ""There's no reason to be walking around with a mask,"" he told CBS. ""When you're in the middle of an outbreak, wearing a mask might make people feel a little bit better and it might even block a droplet, but it's not providing the perfect protection that people think that it is."" These were missteps, without question. But remember the context in which those pleas were made. In early March, hospitals across the country were preparing for a massive surge of patients, and masks were in perilously short supply. Considering the significant risks to front-line health care workers, and the lack of sufficient protective gear, it was understandable -- even if misguided in retrospect -- to want to ensure that masks were available to those who needed them most.

There's also the uncertainty inherent to the scientific process. In the early stages of the pandemic, for instance, it wasn't clear that infected people who had no symptoms could transmit the virus, so there didn't appear to be a need for the general public to wear masks. Now, of course, it's clear that asymptomatic transmission most likely plays a big role in the virus's spread. This doesn't mean we should ignore the scientists, or accuse them, as Fox News's Laura Ingraham did, of being part of ""the medical deep state."" Scientists generate hypotheses based on what they know at the time; some turn out to be incorrect, so scientists adjust and come up with better hypotheses. That is how science works, and most of the time it happens out of the public view. But now, with the whole world watching and on edge, every error is magnified. In any case, it's long past time to stop blaming health officials' messaging. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention updated its guidance to recommend the wearing of masks on April 3; three months later, countless Americans are still refusing. Masks are not a cure-all for the coronavirus pandemic. Countries that have gotten the virus under control have done so through a robust public health response, including aggressive testing and contact tracing. We also need to properly fund research into vaccines and other treatments. Instead, the Trump administration has wound down its coronavirus task force, perhaps because Mr. Trump still seems to believe that, as he put it as recently as Wednesday, the virus is ""going to sort of just disappear, I hope."" The buck stops anywhere but here. The White House continues to deny that it has any responsibility to lead in this effort. On Thursday, Kellyanne Conway, one of Mr. Trump's top aides, said: ""People are not wearing masks. And I don't think they're not wearing masks because the president of the United States is not wearing a mask. They're not wearing a mask because nobody's saying put the mask on."" And all this time we thought the presidency was a bully pulpit. Alas, the leader of the free world still refuses to cover his face in public, although he did claim he was ""all for masks"" earlier this week. The way to deal with an abject failure of leadership like this is at the ballot box in November. But the way to deal with the pandemic's daily assault on America today is to do the things regular people can do with little to no effort: Wash hands regularly, practice social distancing and wear a mask. On this July 4 weekend, consider it the least you can do for your country.","This is not complicated, folks.",9fb07058-fbc5-5f92-a238-d6e4b613f9c3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/02/opinion/02wegman/02wegman-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=335773fc4fb80347f5b11c6127dd84da61c43e75aeb25863bb08f312139d7563&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Clockwise from top left: Vice President Mike Pence; House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; President Donald Trump; Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader.",9fb07058-fbc5-5f92-a238-d6e4b613f9c3,N24News/imgs/9fb07058-fbc5-5f92-a238-d6e4b613f9c3.jpg,11
Sports,"At the U.S. Open, Doubles, of All Things, Stays Stable",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/31/sports/tennis/us-open-doubles.html,"The men's and women's doubles draws at the United States Open this year are stacked with former Grand Slam doubles champions as well as new and exciting partnerships. While doubles may not have the same cachet as the singles tournaments among casual fans, there are still plenty of exciting players to watch -- some because they are paired up. Here are a few teams to watch out for as the week progresses: The two Colombians have paired together once again, and are going for their third Grand Slam doubles title after having won together at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open in 2019. Although both are in their early 30s, their success has only come in the last few years. The two did not play together for the Australian Open this year, after Farah tested positive for anabolic steroids and was suspended from tournament play. Farah argued against the charge, and the International Tennis Federation rescinded his ban earlier this year. Kubot and Melo each hold two Grand Slam titles, including one they share from a victory at Wimbledon in 2017, and others from previous partnerships. The two have played together consistently since 2017, reaching the U.S. Open final in 2018 before losing to Mike Bryan and Jack Sock. They beat the top-seeded Cabal and Farah in the finals of the Mexican Open in February, and will hope to repeat that performance on the faster-paced courts in New York.

Ram and Salisbury are relatively new partners who began playing together consistently at the beginning of 2019. But they quickly showed their strengths, winning two tournaments in 2019, in Qatar and Vienna. They went on to win the Australian Open, the first Grand Slam for either of them. They will hope to take that momentum forward, especially considering that the U.S. Open hardcourts are most similar to the courts on which they secured their championship in Melbourne. The pair of 35-year-olds from the Balkans started playing together in the middle of last year, and quickly won two highly coveted titles in Cincinnati and at the China Open in Beijing. Dodig holds one Grand Slam title, from the 2015 French Open with Marcelo Melo, while his partner has not yet been past the semifinals of a Grand Slam. Dodig and Polasek also have collective experience. Together, they went to the semifinals of Wimbledon in 2019 as well as at the Australian Open this year. The two are an exceptionally formidable pair and will be sure to keep pushing for titles as they try to beat the clock.

Babos and Mladenovic have won three Grand Slam titles together, their latest coming at the Australian Open this year. Although Mladenovic has had some success on the singles tour, reaching a peak rating of No. 10, Babos is a doubles specialist. Babos and Mladenovic are also exceptionally dominant in the WTA Finals, where they have won for the past three years in a row. No doubt, even with the lengthy forced break, the pair will be back to their dominant winning ways. Mertens and Sabalenka, the defending champions, are two young and exceptionally talented players. In the last four Grand Slam tournaments, they have not lost before the quarterfinals, a rare level of consistency, especially for a pair that only began working together at the beginning of 2019. Both players are better known for their successes on the singles tour, but they have become the rare pair that can compete seriously in both formats, and should be paid more attention as they storm through the world of doubles.

This is the pair's first year playing together, and they struggled at the beginning of 2020, losing in the first round at the Australian Open. However, the pair has had some success separately in the past. Melichar reached the final at Wimbledon in 2018 in women's doubles as well as winning the title in mixed doubles. Xu reached the final at Wimbledon in 2019. Together, the two can be a formidable pair, especially on faster playing surfaces like Wimbledon or the U.S. Open. Peschke, at 45, and Schuurs, at 27, have one of the biggest age gaps in doubles tennis. They began working together at the beginning of the year, and while they have not had much success so far, their performances improved throughout the Australia swing at the beginning of 2020. Peschke, who previously played with Nicole Melichar, is an incredibly intelligent doubles player, and won Wimbledon in 2011 with Katarina Srebotnik. Schuurs has yet to make it past the quarterfinals at a Grand Slam, but has previously won three Premier titles, twice while paired up with singles No. 1 Ashleigh Barty and once with Elise Mertens. Here are a few more pairings to watch. The two singles specialists are pairing up for this year's doubles draw. Azarenka reached the finals last year alongside Ashleigh Barty, and has the potential to do so again with this year's Australian Open singles champion. This Midwestern duo reached the quarterfinals in Flushing last year, and Sock won the U.S. Open doubles championship in 2018 alongside Mike Bryan. These Americans are a pleasure to watch, and have the potential to go all the way. These two young Americans are rightly heralded as the future of American tennis. Although they lost in the third round of last year's U.S. Open to Victoria Azarenka and Ashleigh Barty, they are aggressive.","Juan Sebastián Cabal and Robert Farah return to defend their titles, as do Timea Babos and Kristina Mladenovic, in two packed and experienced doubles draws.",b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/08/31/sports/31usopen-lineups-doubles-1/31usopen-lineups-doubles-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=5cbb4fbefbff6c7396c836bbe560755ea57bd7aad930196bf6e253de51ea3677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Robert Farah, right, and Juan Sebastián Cabal celebrated after winning men's doubles at the U.S. Open last year.",b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62,N24News/imgs/b687ba0c-be6b-5342-8d84-455ff0767a62.jpg,9
Television,Stephen Colbert Says It's Too Late to Rebrand Trump's Trade War,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/14/arts/television/stephen-colbert-trumps-trade-war.html,"Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night's highlights that lets you sleep -- and lets us get paid to watch comedy. If you're interested in hearing from The Times regularly about great TV, sign up for our Watching newsletter and get recommendations straight to your inbox. Late night hosts went after President Trump on Monday after China announced a retaliatory tariff increase on American goods. China's president, Xi Jinping, rejected Trump's demands that a trade agreement includes changes in Chinese law, among other things. ""They also objected to the publication of all the details of the agreement, preferring a summary. Oh, really? The White House is upset because China wants to release a summary? [Impersonating Trump] 'No way. No way, Xi. I know how summaries work, O.K.? it's gonna be four pages long and a bucket o' lies.'"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""Now, I don't like this. I feel like this trade war is going to end with Trump riding on the back of a dragon, torching the entire economy."" -- JAMES CORDEN ""I saw that Chinese officials said that, quote, 'No one should expect China to swallow bitter fruit.' And then Trump fired back with, 'I believe the word is vegetable.'"" -- JIMMY FALLON

And while Trump insists that China will foot the bill for the tariffs, his chief economic adviser, Larry Kudlow, said that both China and the United States would end up paying. ""[As Trump] 'It's paid mostly by China. Largely. Somewhat. Kinda sorta. I mean, that's what I heard. They don't pay anything. We're screwed.'"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT During an appearance on Fox News, Kudlow requested the phrase ""trade war"" be traded in for ""trade negotiation,"" which Colbert cried foul over. ""No, you can't. Nice try, though. I know why you want to change it, because it makes it seem less dangerous. There's a reason no one went to see 'Avengers: Infinity Negotiation.'"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

Trump and Xi are scheduled to meet in June to discuss the potential for renegotiation, of which Trump said, ""Maybe something will happen."" Seth Meyers found his statement to be, ""as usual, sounding incredibly vague."" ""'Maybe something will happen.' It sounds like a Mafia boss doing a book report on a book he's never even heard of. [As Trump] '""To Kill a Mockingbird."" It's about a mockingbird. He owes some people some money, maybe something bad happens, but maybe the mockingbird had it coming. Let's just say you don't got to worry about anybody mocking anymore.'"" -- SETH MEYERS Last Friday, Trump referred to the 2020 presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg as ""Alfred E. Neuman,"" the mascot of MAD magazine. ""I see the similarity in that they are both more qualified to be president than Donald Trump."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT Buttigieg's initial response was that he had to Google the reference, saying, ""I guess it's a generational thing."" But he later shared a Chinese proverb about walls and windmills he found to be apt. ""It's a nice thought, but thanks to Trump's tariffs, saying that proverb now costs $80."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT ""That's how you know you've made it,"" Buttigieg joked of Trump's insult in an appearance on ""The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon"" on Monday. ""You know, we talk a lot about elevating the dialogue, so I guess the fact that I inspired him to make a literary reference possibly for the first time ...""

""[As Trump, rapping] I like big tariffs and I cannot lie, you other leaders can't deny, when Xi walks in with the itty bitty trade and the soybeans in your face you get sprung."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT, to the tune of Sir Mix-a-lot's ""Baby Got Back"" ""It's unclear how long this trade war may last. Just to be on the safe side, Trump has already gotten a note from his doctor so he can get out of it."" -- JAMES CORDEN ""These tariffs could raise the price of a huge range of products including dog collars, apparel made from reptile leather, mattress supports and Christmas tree lights. That's really going to hurt the holiday-themed sex-dungeon industry."" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

 Buttigieg joined Jimmy Fallon and the Roots' Tariq Trotter for an edition of ""Slow Jam the News,"" which was dedicated to Buttigieg's campaign.","""I know why you want to change it, because it makes it seem less dangerous,"" Colbert said.

Fashion & Style,6 Ways to Wow Guests at Your Wedding Reception,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/02/fashion/weddings/6-ways-to-wow-guests-at-your-wedding-reception.html,"The bride and groom were once the main attraction at a wedding. Then came the band. Couples spent months listening to tapes -- yes tapes -- or they booked a talented D.J. to coerce attendees onto the dance floor. Now the guests are enveloped in performances: from ballerinas to belly dancers; fire eaters to flash mobs; harpists to harpoonists. ""Couples want to give their guests full sensory and experiential moments that will be unforgettable,"" said Amy Shey Jacobs, owner of Chandelier Events, an event planning and production firm in Manhattan. ""Artistic performances are an added emotional layer that's being incorporated into weddings as surprise elements to entertain everyone. ""There's been a big rise to these out-of-the-box performances and a push toward offering people something fun and breathtaking. These are goose-bump moments from seeing something new. At the same time, there's a subculture of performance artists who are finding weddings as a platform for their art in a broader, mainstream way."" Hotels present performances that align with local traditions: for instance, a mariachi band or hula dancers. Couples hire entertainers who speak to who they are: opera singers for the highbrows; poetry pontificators for the romantics; or street and subway acts for the urbanites. Event planners, too, have a bag of tricks filled with techno dancers, synchronized swimmers, stomp troops and aerialists hanging on 40-foot rigs.

Fire and Knife, Not Fire and Ice Those who think ""fire, good"" may consider illuming their guests' experience with a three-minute fire-knife dance. The Hilton Waikoloa Village's Lagoon Lanai gives newly wedded couples three Hawaiian performers for an indigenous island offering. How It Works After the cake cutting or to commence the dancing, the blowing of a conch shell is heard to make sure everyone's attention is drawn to the fire-knife dancer, who greets the crowd with a loud ""Aloha!"" Fast throbbing from one (about $700) or two drummers (about $915) happens simultaneously as the fire-knife dancer begins. Why Couples Choose This Those who want oohs and aahs from their guests paired with an immersive, authentic element find big allures in acts such as these.

Sit back, relax, mill about, because these folks perform for up to seven hours. That is a long time to be in a bubble. Held at the Hotel Metropole Monte-Carlo in its Odyssey, an outdoor concept designed by Karl Lagerfeld in 2013, the space is part alfresco, part pool, part garden, part art mural. How It Works Like Cirque du Soleil, entertainers perform minishows, which happen throughout the evening. Expect to see clowns on stilts do aerial acrobatics; electronic violinists play Top 40 hits and Vivaldi; futuristic characters a la ""Mad Max"" and ""Back to the Future"" enter on hoverboards while juggling; a floating bubble acrobatic act; and a Disney-like magical laser-and-light show, all while a British radio presenter plays M.C. Also expect to pay more than $20,000 for the show. Why the Couple Chose This ""We wanted something that would provide an 'on the edge of your seat' experience one would get when watching an action movie,"" said Florrie Tseng, 35, who married Jason Ling on July 11, 2015. ""The whole show was designed to be an unforgettable experience. We wanted everyone who was flying across the world from Zimbabwe, Australia, Taiwan, Malaysia, London, China and Hong Kong, to feel it was worth it."" Memorable Moment ""The aerial acrobatic part left guests, and the service staff, in awe,"" Ms. Ling said.

Want the voice without the music? Turn to the harmonious vocal musings of the Virginia Gentlemen, an a cappella group from the University of Virginia. Dressed in navy sport coats, orange and blue bow ties for the university, crisp white button-downs and khaki pants, the group retains a visually pleasing and classic style of an era gone by. How It Works For this specific wedding, 10 singers entered the ceremony during the presentation of the gifts and sang ""Amazing Grace."" Booked for the entire wedding, they performed at the reception as well. The group's performance will cost you $350 for three songs and $50 a song thereafter, plus travel expenses. Why the Couple Chose This Organized by the bride's mother, the group was a gift, and a surprise. ""The guys took our breath away as they gathered in the center aisle of the church,"" said Courtney Bishop, 29, who married Ian O'Connor, 30, on Oct. 9, 2016, at the Holy Comforter Catholic Church, in Charlottesville, Va. ""I turned to my husband to ask what was going on because I thought they were performing at the wrong wedding."" Memorable Moment When the men performed the bride's deceased father's favorite songs: ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and ""Sweet Caroline.""

How It Works Most shows take place on the dance floor during the last hour of the wedding reception and feature two to three performers who interact with guests. They hand out feather boas, sunglasses, hats, light sticks or whistles. The Hora Loca at Conrad Miami with the LED robots and dancers is about $900 to $1,000 for 45 minutes to an hour. Why Couples Choose This ""Having this energized performance during weddings has become a tradition in Latin culture,"" said Ashley Gorden, the catering manager at the Conrad Miami Hotel. ""The bigger and flashier the show is, the more fun guests have."" Last year the hotel did 15 Hora Locas for the 20 weddings they hosted, an increase of 35 percent from 2014. ""It also makes for colorful photos,"" she said. Memorable Moment At the conclusion, thousands of cracker-size colored squares of confetti are shot out of a cannon.

Those who would rather shake their belly than their booty can hire Moroccan belly dancers to perform an authentic Arabian dance. How It Works Right after appetizers have been consumed, but main courses have yet to be served, a small swarm of festively clothed dancers perform for 20 minutes. The first song is done solo, but by the second, they have moved to different tables and are wooing unsuspecting attendees to join in. The bride is the first to stand, then other guests follow. A couple can expect to pay about $100 a dancer.

Why Couples Choose This ""I honestly couldn't imagine having a wedding in Morocco and not having belly dancers,"" said Jane Lerman, 30, who married Shane Fonner, 37, on April 16, 2016, at a private villa in the Palmeraie area of Marrakesh. ""I stood pretty firmly on this since Day 1. I loved that the dancers interacted with our guests. Everyone let go of their inhibitions. It was a great bonding experience for everyone."" Memorable Moment ""Seeing my mother trying to belly dance was really fun,"" she said. ""Dancing with them, and listening to their entire body shake and jingle from the metal bangles that were attached to their bras and skirts was surreal and extraordinary.""","Why stop at the D.J. or the band?

Fashion & Style,Med Students Get an Extra Match on 'Match Day',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/30/fashion/weddings/med-students-get-an-extra-match-on-match-day.html,"Match Day at the University of Mississippi Medical Center is always a big deal. It's the day medical students in their final year learn where they will be doing their residencies for the next three to five years. The nationwide system works a little like rushing for a college sorority or fraternity. Medical institutions rank their preference of medical students, and the students do the same. An algorithm determines ""a match,"" which the students are contractually obligated to abide by. The match is announced at a ceremony full of pomp and tradition. In Mississippi, students, along with family and friends, gather in a large auditorium. Students walk on stage one by one, open a sealed envelope, and read the contents aloud. Prizes are awarded to students in various categories, like the farthest away residency program. This year Match Day, which took place on March 15, came with a surprise: One student got her match not just for her residency, but for life.

Morgan Davis, 27, was already nervous for her time on stage. ""I felt like I wanted to throw up,"" she said. ""I couldn't breathe."" She felt better when she opened her envelope saying she matched with the University of California San Diego, her first choice. But then she was handed another envelope. Inside was a sheet of paper saying, ""Will you marry me?"" She turned around and saw her now-fiance, Maurice Mills, 25, a first lieutenant in the United States Marines, by her side with an engagement ring. ""I knew it was such a big day for Morgan,"" said Mr. Mills, who goes by the nickname Mo. ""She had been working so hard and traveling all over the world doing interviews and rotations. I figured what a better way to celebrate all the work she had done than a proposal?"" He paused before adding, ""I did feel really bad for the person right behind us."" Across the country, couples are escalating Match Day by using it as an opportunity to propose. For some, it's a way to affirm their commitment as a partner enters a new phase in medical training. Hayden Sanders proposed to his longtime girlfriend Jessica Van Duyne on Match Day at the University of Mississippi Medical Center. In her class of 146 students, Ms. Davis wasn't the only one to get a ring that day. Her classmate, Hayden Sanders, got on his knee for longtime girlfriend Jessica Van Duyne.

However, Mr. Sanders did it more privately. After the Match Day ceremony Ms. Van Duyne thought she was headed to a celebratory lunch for her boyfriend. But when she arrived at Fairview Inn, a historic home in Jackson, she saw a gazebo outside covered in roses and ferns and containing a scrapbook full of pictures of the couple. ""I looked at Hayden and said, 'You don't want to spend this day to yourself and celebrate where you are matching?'"" Ms. Van Duyne said. ""It made it so special that he made this day that was supposed to be about him, about us.""

In March 2018, Luke Ansorge, 27, proposed to Luke Fischer, 31, on Mr. Fischer's Match Day at Michigan State College of Human Medicine. After he looked at the residency letter, he handed his boyfriend a letter of his own, one that contained a proposal. Mr. Fischer decided that no matter where he matched (it ended up being the University of Alabama at Birmingham), Mr. Ansorge would be joining him. Being engaged helped Mr. Ansorge convince his employer, Meijer, a regional grocery store chain where he introduces new products, to let him work remotely.

""After Match Day I told Meijer's leadership that I have to go to Alabama because my fiance is contractually obligated to go there,"" Mr. Ansorge said. ""I think the fact that we were engaged made it more serious for them. He wasn't just my boyfriend. I wasn't just running away to be in love and do something crazy."" Another benefit to proposing on Match Day is that the couple's closest friends and family are already present for the ceremony. This makes it easier to keep the other reason for their presence a surprise. ""I guess I should have known what was happening because most people had five or so family members in the crowd and I had almost 30,"" Ms. Davis said. If there is a downside to this new tradition it's the timing. Many couples have no time to plan a wedding when at least one person is moving (most likely two) and starting a new job. ""Sometimes I work 80, 85 hours a week,"" Mr. Ansorge said. ""We just picked up our lives and moved to Alabama, and I started a new job. It seems like a lot to put on a wedding on top of us. Luckily we have no pressure from family or friends to set a date, so we haven't yet."" Mr. Sanders felt the same way. ""We don't want that long of an engagement, but it would be a lot to get married right now,"" he said. ""Next year I'll be starting my intern year. Then I want to do a fellowship after that. We got to one light at the end of the tunnel, but there are more tunnels. We'll do it when it feels more manageable.""","Across the country, couples are escalating the day they learn where they will go for their residencies by using it as an opportunity to propose.",52bde2e4-98c0-5112-973d-638c1e9df0b6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/04/07/fashion/weddings/07matchday1/00matchday1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b64406223de2a26828e473b44b6143d0ace33e35006ffe61a6d079258a06c849&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Morgan Davis received two surprises on Match Day at the University of Mississippi Medical Center.

Media,Matt Lauer Offers Apology (With a Caveat),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/30/business/media/matt-lauer-nbc-statement.html,"Powerful men continue to be accused of sexual harassment and assaults, and have been responding by accepting, hedging or dodging the allegations.

Matt Lauer expressed ""sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused"" in a statement on Thursday morning, his first public comments after NBC News fired the star ""Today"" show anchor amid allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior with colleagues. ""Some of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed,"" Mr. Lauer wrote in a message issued by his public relations team. ""I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly."" ""There are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,"" Mr. Lauer wrote. ""To the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.""

Mr. Lauer's abrupt downfall comes amid a head-spinning series of harassment and abuse claims that have toppled powerful men in journalism, comedy, Hollywood and Silicon Valley, including the movie mogul Harvey Weinstein and another famed television morning host, Charlie Rose of CBS. By Thursday, NBC had received at least three complaints related to Mr. Lauer, including from a former employee who said that the anchor sexually assaulted her in his office in 2001. Another woman, who spoke with NBC executives on Monday evening, described interactions with Mr. Lauer that began while covering the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia. Mr. Lauer's statement concluded: ""Repairing the damage will take a lot of time and soul-searching and I'm committed to beginning that effort. It is now my full-time job. The last two days have forced me to take a very hard look at my own troubling flaws. It's been humbling. I am blessed to be surrounded by the people I love. I thank them for their patience and grace."" A fixture of American living rooms for more than two decades, Mr. Lauer was uncharacteristically silent on Wednesday in the wake of his firing, which left the television industry stunned and dominated headlines around the country. His former co-host on the ""Today"" show, Savannah Guthrie, read his statement aloud at the start of Thursday's 7 a.m. broadcast, saying the program had received Mr. Lauer's remarks just moments before going on air. ""It is a difficult morning here again,"" Ms. Guthrie said at the beginning of the show, as headlines flashed onscreen about ""Troubling Allegations"" involving the man who, until Tuesday, had welcomed millions of Americans every morning to the same broadcast.

Stephanie Gosk, an NBC News correspondent, came on set to present a report on the allegations against Mr. Lauer, describing him as ""one of the most high-profile faces of the sexual harassment firestorm engulfing this country."" Ms. Gosk confirmed a report in The New York Times that two additional women had filed complaints about Mr. Lauer to NBC News on Wednesday, in the hours after the anchor's firing was announced, bringing the total number of complaints against him to three.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. In a sign of how dominant the issue of harassment has become, much of Thursday's ""Today"" program touched on allegations of abuse and misconduct. Ms. Guthrie conducted an interview with Marion Brown, who described being harassed by Representative John Conyers of Michigan, who is at the center of his own scandal.

Megyn Kelly, the host of the show's 9 a.m. hour, used her opening segment to invite Mr. Lauer's accusers, and Mr. Lauer, to appear with her on the show. ""We have been that place in all the other cases, and we will be that place, as well as for the accused, here on this hour,"" Ms. Kelly said, looking into the camera. Citing allegations from various news reports, Ms. Kelly also spent more time describing Mr. Lauer's alleged misbehavior than his former co-hosts in the show's 7 a.m. hour had. Still, some members of the ""Today"" team found room for lighter fare. Ms. Guthrie and Mr. Lauer's substitute, Hoda Kotb, gushed about the lighting of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree on Wednesday evening, a live television event that Mr. Lauer had been scheduled to co-host (he did not appear). And when the meteorologist Al Roker came onscreen for his first weather report, he adopted his usual perky mien.","Mr. Lauer expressed ""sorrow and regret.""

Technology,Far Right Sees 'Miracle' in Trump's Outing. Medical Experts See Recklessness.,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/technology/trump-secret-service-ride.html,"President Trump's decision to drive by well-wishers outside Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Sunday was widely criticized by medical experts as irresponsible for unnecessarily exposing Secret Service agents inside the vehicle to the virus. ""By taking a joy ride outside Walter Reed the president is placing his Secret Service detail at grave risk,"" tweeted Dr. Jonathan Reiner, professor of medicine and surgery at George Washington University. ""This is the height of irresponsibility."" Yet many far-right commenters called it something else: a miracle. They said it was evidence that the president was overcoming his illness from the coronavirus. The Gateway Pundit, a website notorious for regularly spreading misinformation and falsehoods, published an article calling Mr. Trump's drive-by to greet fans a ""miracle in Maryland.""

""I believe in miracles,"" said another tweet on Sunday afternoon, after Mr. Trump's doctor said he could return to the White House as early as Monday. ""We are going to see another one in November!""

Others reposted and repeated Mr. Trump's own words in a video he released on Saturday that his hospitalization and process of recovery constituted a ""miracle from God coming down."" Alex Plitsas, the vice chairman of the Fairfield Republican Town Committee in Connecticut and a onetime contributor to the conservative news and opinion site The Daily Caller, said the people criticizing Mr. Trump's trip past supporters on Sunday were hypocritical. He said that they advocated wearing masks to stop the spread of the virus, but that when Mr. Trump wore one they said that was not enough to please them.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization say face coverings are a safeguard but not an absolute guarantee of stopping transmission -- especially in a small, sealed space like a vehicle occupied by a person known to be infected, as was the case on Sunday.

Mr. Plitsas did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Greg Price, another contributor to The Daily Caller, said the Secret Service agents accompanying Mr. Trump during the drive-by had always been at risk because they have been around the president during his bout of illness.

""The point of my tweet was that the safety of the agents didn't become a big story until President Trump did the drive by,"" Mr. Price said in a direct message on Monday. Dr. James Phillips, an attending physician at Walter Reed, said the specific situation of being in a sealed vehicle increased the agents' risk.

Science,Lithium-Ion Batteries Work Earns Nobel Prize in Chemistry for 3 Scientists,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/09/science/nobel-prize-chemistry.html,"The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences on Wednesday awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry to three scientists who developed lithium-ion batteries, which have revolutionized portable electronics and are very likely powering a device you're using now to read this article. Larger examples of the batteries have given rise to electric cars that can be driven on long trips, while the miniaturized versions are used in lifesaving medical devices like cardiac defibrillators. John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino will share the prize, which is worth about $900,000. ""Lithium-ion batteries are a great example of how chemistry can transform people's lives,"" said Bonnie Charpentier, president of the American Chemical Society. ""It's wonderful to see this work recognized by the Nobel Prize."" The three researchers' work in the 1970s and '80s led to the creation of powerful, lightweight and rechargeable batteries used in nearly every smartphone or laptop computer, and in billions of cameras and power tools. Astronauts on the International Space Station rely on them, and engineers working on renewable energy grids often turn to them. By storing electricity generated when sunlight and wind are at their peak, lithium-ion batteries can reduce dependence on fossil fuel energy sources and help lessen the impact of climate change.

M. Stanley Whittingham, 77, a professor at Binghamton University, State University of New York, and one of the three winners, said that he always hoped lithium-ion technology would grow, ""but we never envisaged it growing this far. We never imagined it being ubiquitous in things like iPhones."" John B. Goodenough, 97, is a professor at the University of Texas at Austin. With the award he becomes the oldest Nobel Prize winner, but is still active in research. And Akira Yoshino, 71, is an honorary fellow for the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Tokyo and a professor at Meijo University in Nagoya, Japan. He said after the announcement that he was pleased that the technology could also help fight climate change, calling lithium-ion batteries ""suitable for a sustainable society."" Ever since Alessandro Volta invented the first true battery in 1800, scientists have tried to find ways to get electrons to flow from a negative electrode called an anode to a positive electrode called a cathode. Volta did this by stacking discs of copper and zinc, and linking them with a cloth soaked in salty water. When wires were connected to the discs to complete a circuit, the battery produced a stable current. In subsequent decades, versions of these batteries powered telegraphs and other devices.

For many years, there were no major advancements in battery technology. But the Arab oil embargo of 1973 made many scientists realize the extent of society's dependence on fossil fuels. Dr. Whittingham, who was working for Exxon at the time, began searching for improved ways to store energy from renewable sources and power electric cars. He knew that lithium would make a good anode because it released electrons easily. It also had the advantage of being the lightest metal. So Dr. Whittingham started looking for materials that had a high energy density and captured lithium-ions in the cathode -- the side of your battery with the plus sign. Dr. Whittingham discovered that titanium disulfide, which had never been used in batteries before, had a molecular structure that let lithium-ions into small pockets. This resulted in the first functional lithium battery. ""The big advantage of this technology was that lithium-ion stored about 10 times as much energy as lead-acid or 5 times as much as nickel-cadmium,"" Dr. Whittingham said. Lithium-ion batteries were also extremely lightweight and required little maintenance. ""So there was a huge incentive to move to lithium-ion.""

Dr. Goodenough, then at Oxford, predicted that lithium-ion batteries would have greater potential if the cathode were made with a different material. He noticed that cobalt oxide was similar in structure to titanium disulfide. It could tolerate lithium being pushed into it and pulled out over and over. It also made the lithium-ion battery almost twice as powerful as Dr. Whittingham's. The battery now generated four volts. Building from Dr. Goodenough's work, Dr. Yoshino, who was at the Asahi Kasei Corporation in Japan, then showed that more complicated carbon-based electrodes could house lithium-ions in between their layers too. This eliminated pure lithium from the battery entirely. Instead, the system used only lithium-ions, which are safer. These developments ultimately led to commercialization of the lithium-ion battery in 1991 by another Japanese electronics giant, Sony Corporation. The compact nature and reliability of lithium-ion batteries made the technology a staple in electronics that had once been powered primarily by disposable batteries that consumers always seemed to run out of at the wrong time. That included radios, hand-held gaming devices, laptop computers and eventually smartphones and wearable computers.

Technologists often point to lithium-ion as an innovation roadblock: While computer chips have doubled in speed every few years and digital displays have become significantly brighter and sharper, tech companies have made only incremental improvements on batteries; there's not much that engineers can do beyond making the batteries bigger and implementing software algorithms to make hardware more power efficient. Despite the hiccups, companies continue to rely on the batteries because they can be cheaply and reliably reproduced. They have also been scaled up for use in larger settings. Energy storage, most often using lithium-ion battery technology, is widely seen as necessary for transforming the electric grid to a carbon-free system and combating the effects of climate change. Most electricity in the United States -- and in many other parts of the world -- comes from fossil fuel sources, predominantly natural gas but also coal. Battery technology helps replace those carbon-emitting sources because it allows power companies to store excess solar and wind power when the sun does not shine nor the wind blow -- the weakness of those carbon-free sources. The most critical area for the electric grid has been providing power when people return home from work during the summer and turn on their air-conditioners, cook dinner and wash clothes, when utilities often rely on natural gas plants designed to meet those periods of high demand, known as peaking plants, which typically are more expensive. ""What's exciting about lithium-ion technology is it has the power to unlock the sun 24-7 to really help renewable energy power our future in a way that we haven't been able to capture until now,"" said Bernadette Del Chiaro, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association, an industry group. The potential of battery technology is highlighted in Northern California, where Pacific Gas & Electric is shutting off power to hundreds of thousands of customers on Wednesday because of the risk of wildfires.

More than half of lithium is gathered using brine extraction from deep inside the earth, especially in South America, and the rest is still mined traditionally from rock. Both methods have caused environmental damage to areas around lithium processing operations. And as the demand for lithium increases, companies may resort to using energy-intensive heating to speed up brine evaporation. Some lithium sources could also be overextracted. Once lithium-ion batteries are used up in electronics, they are often disposed of improperly by consumers. Less than 5 percent of lithium-ion batteries are collected and recycled in the United States, according to the Department of Energy. ""If you think about the batteries in cellphones, most of them are thrown away and end up in landfills,"" said Alexej Jerschow, a chemist at New York University.","John B. Goodenough, M.

Fashion & Style,Liberation by Gucci (Even if It Was in the Dark),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/fashion/gucci-alessandro-michele-cruise-2020.html,"Liberation by Gucci (Even if It Was in the Dark)

ROME -- The sky was black, with ominous clouds overhead. Almost 500 guests sheltered inside the renowned Capitoline Museums (widely considered the first museum in the world where art could be enjoyed by all, not just the elite) on Tuesday, waiting for the Gucci 2020 cruise collection. There was just one problem: They couldn't see a thing. The long frescoed galleries of the Capitoline were shrouded in darkness. And so they went, stumbling through its blacked-out marbled hallways along with fellow guests like Elton John, Zoe Saldana and Saoirse Ronan. Eventually, they found that a small flashlight had been left on each mirrored cube of a seat. ""My work sometimes is like being an archaeologist. I discover things. Using a torch to find things that hide in darkness,"" Alessandro Michele, Gucci's creative director, said by way of explanation, looking a little tired with his beard and a black velvet hat. ""With it in your hand, you can decide what to see and on what treasures you can shine your light.""

It was all a metaphor! And what, exactly, did Mr. Michele want illuminated? Perhaps the fact that his ongoing practice of mining history, ancient cultures and religions with his magpie eye produced Gucci's first quarter 2019 sales of EUR2.3 billion ($2.57 billion), up 20 percent from the same period a year earlier. Or perhaps that he is a loyal son of Rome, born here in 1972 and raised on its museums and churches. Perhaps it was that the show was his first in the city for Gucci (although he already has moved the house's design headquarters here), and thus a triumphant homecoming of sorts.

""It was very important to me to organize this show in Rome,"" he said after the show. ""To pay tribute, and to glorify this place of freedom. Rome is a big womb and many things have come out of it. I will disappear one day, but this city will always remain."" This latest collection was not just another sprawling homage to the glories of the ancient past. As the models emerged, some with ""Gucci"" tattoos inked like gags across their mouths, it was, Mr. Michele declared, also a loud rallying cry for freedom of self-expression. Specifically, for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights. ""Nobody should have the right to decide about the freedom of choice of any human being,"" Mr. Michele said . ""The news I recently read in the newspaper made me reflect on the fact that women have to be respected. They should be considered as some men consider themselves, and be free to choose what they want.""

And so the models came, in everything from a billowing gown embroidered with an outline of the female reproductive system and embellished with pink flowers, to lace cycling shorts, furry wraps and fishnets. There were T-shirts and jackets bearing the slogans ""my body my choice,"" or ""May 22, 1978,"" when abortion was first legalized in Italy. Also, in a wry subversion of patriarchal power dressing favorites, a sweeping imperial scarlet cape embroidered with gold leaves, as well as a series of black papal cassocks, trimmed in fake fur. Mr. Michele's Gucci has always been about a flamboyant and occasionally profound conversation with the zeitgeist, drawing from it, adding to it, sometimes even altering the way the fashion world sees value, gender and identity. Sometimes that chatter can miss its mark, like in February, when the brand apologized for a $890 women's balaclava sweater, widely denounced on social media as evoking blackface imagery.

However this collection, coming in the wake of recent events in Alabama and anti-abortion activity in other states -- felt more convincing and personal in its intentions than most. That may be why, despite his clear statement about choice, Mr. Michele also went on to mix messages. Alongside women's rights , he included men's wear looks that included a toga draped across a gray plaid suit, shell suits in Gucci's hallmark green, black and red palette and some lilac Liberty prints. The boys' choices also included a series of long and short dresses in rich brocade or Mickey Mouse motifs, an encore of the continuing Gucci movement toward a more genderless, seasonless kind of self-determination.

The drumbeat to it all was a familiar paean to the freedom and liberation of the 1970s -- a crucial decade for women's liberation. Here it came in the form of brocade and plaid suiting, beaded ruffle skirts and wide-brimmed hats; also corduroy flares, oversized eyeglasses, printed guitar cases and romantic silk dresses with kerchief hems and billowing sleeves. In case you missed the point, several hours later the cult '70s heroine Stevie Nicks, wearing a black corset and lace gloves, took to the stage at the boozy, slightly rain-soaked after-party to serenade the crowd. Later -- because for Mr. Michele, if one thing is good, two is better -- Gucci's favorite poster boy, Harry Styles, also appeared, sporting a white tuxedo and pastel nail polish, for a final triumphant duet of ""Landslide."" Then, using the light of their cellphones, the Gucci gang dispersed into the shadows, and off into the night.","Alessandro Michele's cruise 2020 collection focused on women's rights, by flashlight.",b07e5896-251a-5cef-8594-73e75cd80523,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/05/29/world/29gucci-6/5f260dbd2a7d4bcca38f55889b1e7d7c-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=304&w=581&s=a52e7a06bbd7ec6a599ce66f6a3ed4a846701016e64e89568f8d23f064655442&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Gucci cruise collection 2020,b07e5896-251a-5cef-8594-73e75cd80523,N24News/imgs/b07e5896-251a-5cef-8594-73e75cd80523.jpg,19
Movies,'Skin' Review: Divide and Prejudice,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/movies/skin-review.html,"The British actor Jamie Bell has soft eyes and a bashful demeanor, both of which served him well as Bernie Taupin in the recent Elton John biopic, ""Rocketman."" These traits must be virtually erased, however, to play the real-life former white supremacist Bryon Widner in ""Skin,"" a blistering story of rage and redemption that never fully illuminates the journey from one to the other.

That's not because Bell's performance is wanting -- far from it. Like Edward Norton in Tony Kaye's incendiary 1998 drama, ""American History X,"" Bell transforms convincingly from slogan-spewing skinhead to decent human being. Unfolding in flashback as Widner undergoes multiple agonizing treatments to erase the vile tattoos that blanket his face and body -- a literal and metaphorical personality peel -- the movie immerses us in the dark heart of white power.

What it doesn't do is expose the psychological soft spots and belief systems that allow extremism to grow: Widner's neo-Nazi views appear more the result of habit than philosophy, absorbed incrementally from the heartland hate group that virtually raised him. Consequently the story, pumped up with the now-familiar ""Blood and Soil""-yelling meatheads, centers mainly on the physical perils of his decision to leave; his ideological conversion, if it exists, remains stubbornly veiled.",An intense Jamie Bell plays a tormented white supremacist in this blistering study of rage and redemption.,1860a4e9-6dba-537d-8a69-995f43022f00,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/26/arts/skin1/skin1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=b73edd3899af6e33ba459c29bdd8ac3b9b9f162112c40b54ea8ec0fcf1b70e28&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Jamie Bell in &ldquo;Skin,&rdquo; directed by Guy Nattiv.",1860a4e9-6dba-537d-8a69-995f43022f00,N24News/imgs/1860a4e9-6dba-537d-8a69-995f43022f00.jpg,5
Music,Hip-Hop's Year of Dangerous Living Put the Accused on the Charts,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/05/arts/music/xxxtentacion-tay-k-kodak-black-accusations-criticism.html,"A still from 6ix9ine's video for ""Gummo,"" which is currently on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The rapper pleaded guilty to the use of a child in a sexual performance in 2015.

In Hollywood and in the media, 2017 was a year of reckoning -- powerful men brought down under the weight of their own misdeeds. But the opposite happened in hip-hop: Many of the genre's most creatively promising rising talent arrived with troubling back stories, speeding onto the Billboard charts -- and into the ears of millions -- while operating under the cloud of criminal accusations or convictions. And unlike those who were quickly removed from perches of power, these young artists thrived, in spite of -- or perhaps in part owing to -- the severity of the allegations lodged against them. The accusations of heinous criminal behavior are clear: XXXTentacion has been charged with the assault of a pregnant woman and later with witness tampering; he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Tay-K is facing a pair of murder charges, for which he maintains his innocence. Kodak Black has had a string of arrests and is facing trial for criminal sexual conduct; his lawyers say he is innocent. And 6ix9ine pleaded guilty in 2015 to the use of a child in a sexual performance. But the statistics are just as clear: XXXTentacion's first album, ""17,"" debuted at No. 2 on the Billboard album chart, and his breakthrough single ""Look at Me,"" which began as a SoundCloud loosie, made it to No. 34 on the Hot 100. Tay-K's ""The Race"" went to No. 44 on the Hot 100. Currently, 6ix9ine has two songs on the Hot 100, ""Gummo"" at No. 14 and ""Kooda"" at No. 54. Kodak Black's first album, ""Painting Pictures,"" debuted at No. 3 on the album chart, and was certified gold. ""Tunnel Vision,"" a single from that album, was certified double platinum and went to No. 6 on the Hot 100.

How to reckon with this gap, though, is still a work in progress, and a challenge. These artists are thriving in real time, and their renown is growing for music that is often inventive and compelling. But knowing the details of their alleged criminal behavior makes listening a charged act. At the same time, plenty of people are listening to, and embracing, these artists -- some who might be familiar with these complexities and some who might not. Especially in the streaming ecosystem, an artist's song moves through the world much more fluidly than the artist's biography. What this moment demands is an honest, raw and difficult form of criticism, one that assesses work for its creative merit while not flinching from the circumstances of its creators. Dismissing the art outright when millions of others won't, or can't, do the same ends up being a kind of failure. Attempting to understand why something is effective, even when it comes from an objectionable source, is a task that criticism is uniquely suited to handle. Last year's reckoning with sexual misconduct followed a pattern: accusations of misbehavior, then rightful condemnation, then excommunication. If the men were creatively active, their current work was effectively scrubbed.

But what's happening in hip-hop is different. After several years defined by the soothing, melodic aesthetic of Drake, the genre is in the midst of a slow pendulum swing toward the harsher, the darker, the more foreboding. Outlaw appeal has long been integral to hip-hop -- think Tupac Shakur, 50 Cent, Chief Keef and dozens more -- and rappers from this new generation with difficult back stories are in the early stages of their careers, in a genre in which tolerance of complicated histories tends to be high, and in which skepticism about institutions like law enforcement can reframe someone accused of a crime as an anti-authoritarian folk hero. Kodak Black's story is especially familiar. He is one of the most slyly affecting lyricists in hip-hop, and one who sometimes raps about the heavy weight of morality in an amoral world. ""I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb/Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could,"" he raps on ""Day for Day."" In the past two years, Kodak has been in and out of jail regularly on a variety of charges, including first-degree criminal sexual conduct, for which he has yet to stand trial. His public image has been one marked by persistent bad decisions, and his art has in part been an attempt to address them. He raps with a heavy, gnarled drawl and at a creeping pace -- he sounds weary. In places he asks openly for forgiveness. On ""Versatile,"" from his ""Project Baby 2: All Grown Up"" mixtape, he insists he's leaving his demons in the past: ""When I took rapping serious I threw the towel in/But Lord you say you gonna forgive me so forgive me then."" There is a similar tension underscoring the work of XXXTentacion, whose music began to seep out from the SoundCloud rap underground this year when he was in jail on harrowing charges of assaulting a pregnant woman, reported to be his girlfriend. (He has yet to stand trial.)

Stylistically, XXXTentacion is near the forefront of young rappers weaving emo and gothic elements into their sound. Kendrick Lamar supported him on Twitter, urging his followers to ""listen to this album if you feel anything. raw thoughts."" However there is little ambiguity in XXXTentacion's art: He named a song on ""17"" after the woman he is accused of assaulting, and another for a female friend who committed suicide while visiting him. He's comfortable in confessional mode in his music and his social media outbursts, which toggle between petulance, complaining about how he is misperceived, and grace, encouraging his followers with warmth and inspiration. The literalism of ""17"" is both its most attractive quality and also its most worrisome -- any attempt to separate the art from the artist is impossible, because XXXTentacion won't allow it. That's similar to Tay-K's ""The Race,"" a song about being on the run recorded while the rapper was in fact on the run. The song is impudent and loose -- it's effective because its sense of abandon is tactile. ""Gummo"" by 6ix9ine is the rowdiest anthem from a SoundCloud rap scene that thrives on rowdy anthems, and has undoubtedly benefited from the rapper's image, from his long rainbow-colored hair and teeth to his barely veiled outlaw persona. Screaming his raps like a latter-day DMX, 6ix9ine calls back to a time when New York hip-hop had rawer edges. But even though he has been convicted of an awful crime, he has begun to pierce the mainstream. Funkmaster Flex, the longtime nighttime D.J. on Hot 97 who privileges New York rap's tough street mythos, has become an enthusiastic booster.

With the amount of information available to listeners, unenlightened consumption should no longer be a viable option, but it remains possible because of how easily music is transmitted divorced from full context. (And for certain audiences, especially young ones, the abstraction of outlaw appeal far outweighs considerations of the real-life damage an artist may have inflicted.) It's also important to remember how many different forms of listening there are: passive and active, aural and physical, concerned and unconcerned. Listening is an ongoing negotiation, a process that engages the ear, but also the mind, body and heart. Thoughtful criticism should tether these artists' creative work with the accusations against them; otherwise, they will remain able to be consumed independent of each other. And that would be a mistake. That's especially true because traditional media is not the only, or even the loudest, available megaphone. This wave of artists has been buttressed by a range of institutions, many of which benefit from asking few questions. These artists have received placement on key playlists on streaming services like Spotify, which has no formal criticism in its editorial offerings, and in some cases, they play on major radio stations, which also rarely factor nonmusical considerations into its rotations. And that's saying nothing of the companies that support these artists financially. Kodak Black is signed to Atlantic Records, as is YoungBoy Never Broke Again, who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault with a firearm this year. XXXTentacion signed a recording contract with Empire Distribution, and while Tay-K sits in jail awaiting trial, he has inked a deal with 88 Classic, an imprint run by an RCA Records executive. Other artists have attempted to capitalize on the viral notoriety of these rappers by working with them. XXXTentacion's first high-profile mainstream collaboration was with Noah Cyrus, Miley's 17-year-old younger sister. Kodak Black, the most established of these artists, has released songs with Lil Wayne and Young Thug, among many others (including XXXTentacion). Tay-K's ""The Race"" was remixed informally by several rappers, and now that he's signed, an official remix featuring 21 Savage and Young Nudy has arrived. The more tightly these artists are woven into the fabric of the music industry, the less likely they are to disappear quietly. A final part of the pattern that emerged with last year's high-profile abusers was contrition, ostensibly as a table setting for rehabilitation. But that hasn't happened with this crop of rappers. Instead, the past year has made clear that they are finding listeners long before they find resolution, legal or moral. In other industries, conversations are just now beginning about whether those who have been accused of terrible acts can someday be welcomed back, first as people and later as contributing members of the creative community. But hip-hop isn't waiting.","In Hollywood and the media, allegations of misconduct brought down powerful men.

Global Business,OPEC Leaves Production Quotas in Place,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/13/business/global/opec-leaves-production-quotas-in-place.html,"Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries left their 30 million-barrel-per-day quota for oil production intact Wednesday, indicating the cartel's satisfaction with current crude prices and its reluctance to do anything to further weaken the world economy. But even as it stuck with the status quo, OPEC may face serious tests in the near future, as rising production in the United States and elsewhere threatens the cartel's market share and influence in the world. So far, though, OPEC has had an easy year. Crude prices have been stable and within the range the organization favors. Although oil prices for U.S.-produced oil have fallen into the range of $80 to $90 a barrel, the price of a global benchmark, Brent crude, remains well above $100 per barrel. The OPEC basket price, which members consider representative of what they receive for their oil, was $104.80 a barrel on Tuesday.

""At these prices no one wants to rock the boat,"" said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Cera , who was in the meeting, held in Vienna. But the global oil market is undergoing significant change, led by the surge in U.S. oil production, which reached 6.5 million barrels a day in September. That was the highest since 1998 and a 900,000 barrels-per-day increase from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, Iraq, an OPEC member not subject to the organization's quotas because the country is recovering from the ravages of war, is also rapidly increasing production, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s. OPEC probably cannot avoid being buffeted by these shifts and their impact on market share. ""More production in the U.S. means there is less available for OPEC,"" said Jamie Webster, an analyst for Washington-based consultants PFCEnergy, who was in Vienna observing the meeting. Approximately a third of global oil output is produced by the cartel's 12 members: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.

The high oil prices of recent years have led oil companies to invest heavily in exploration and in techniques to extract hydrocarbons that until recently were off limits, including the shale formations in North Dakota in the United States. As a result, supply is increasing faster than just about anyone expected, while demand remains sluggish as a result of the tepid world economy. IHS Cera, a market analysis firm, expects the global supply of oil from non-OPEC producers like the United States, Kazakhstan and Brazil to grow by 1.2 million barrels per day next year. That would be well ahead of world demand, which the firm expects to increase by only 800,000 barrels a day in 2013. Should this prediction, which is in line with the cartel's own forecast, prove to be on the mark, OPEC will probably need to trim its output, giving up market share, to buffer falling prices. The signs are that -- quota notwithstanding -- it is already cutting back. An OPEC report published Tuesday showed that Saudi Arabia, the key decision maker in the group, had already reduced output by 200,000 barrels a day in November, to 9.5 million barrels per day, its lowest level since October 2011. ""If the world ends up with a lot more capacity to produce oil than appetite to consume it, then either OPEC countries have to figure out a way to cut back production or prices will crash,"" said Michael Levi, an energy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""Sometimes OPEC doesn't make decisions, but individual countries do and then others follow.""

* Dollar Tree will raise prices to $1.25 by the end of April. Abdalla Salem el-Badri, the OPEC secretary general, acknowledged the possibility of production cuts in Vienna on Wednesday. ""Maybe in the coming months we will produce less,"" he said.

But if prices look in danger of plummeting, the Saudis would very likely ask their Gulf neighbors and the wider organization to help out, possibly threatening the organization's cohesion. ""It could cause tension in OPEC if they had to cut back substantially to shore up prices; some of the pain might have to be shared,"" said Mr. Bahree of IHS CERA. At the meeting, OPEC ministers voted to retain Mr. El-Badri, a former Libyan oil official, as secretary general for another year, partly because Iran and Saudi Arabia, longtime rivals for influence in the group, could not agree on a successor. The rapid growth of Iraqi production may mean OPEC needs to find even larger cuts. Iraq has already surpassed sanction-hampered Iran and become the second-largest producer in the cartel and has plans to go much higher. The International Energy Organization's central base case forecast for Iraqi production is 4.2 million barrels per day by 2015 and 6.1 million by 2020. That is much less than Iraq's own ambitions but substantially over its current production of roughly 3.1 million barrels per day. Although OPEC will probably want to bring Iraq back under its quota system, Iraq seems likely to resist. The Iraqi deputy prime minister Hussain Al-Shahristani argued recently that the country needs to make up for the production and revenue it lost for decades under the regime of Saddam Hussein.

Mr. Al-Shahristani said at a conference in London on Dec. 13 that when his country's production reached 4 milllion to 5 million barrels per day, ""we will start discussions with other members of OPEC."" But if world demand remains sluggish, Iraq's fellow OPEC members may not be patient. World economic performance is the key. Stronger growth would stoke demand for energy and help soak up substantial increases in supply, as happened when Russia increased its oil production by around 50 percent between 1998 and 2004. On Wednesday, the International Energy Agency revised its demand forecasts for next year upward by 100,000 barrels per day, giving some comfort to OPEC. But the I.E.A., an autonomous group that represents oil-consuming nations, wrote that it was trying to interpret a confusing outlook, noting that the European economy is stagnant, while trends for China, the big source of demand growth in recent years, are hard to predict. Some analysts argue that oil prices are as high as they are today only because of fear of a major disruption, particularly one resulting from the tensions between the United States and Iran over the country's nuclear program. As OPEC trims output, the spare capacity -- the buffer of oil available to compensate for any outages -- will expand. IHS CERA forecasts that spare capacity will reach about 3.7 million barrels per day -- most of it held by the Saudis -- in 2013. That is enough oil to deal with all but the most dire events and could calm markets, cooling prices.","The cartel, meeting in Vienna, faces huge challenges to its market position from rising production in the United States and elsewhere.",9200fb04-61cf-50d1-acdb-ef7db3fc68ab,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/12/13/business/Opec/Opec-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=196&w=600&s=691c7ae6d812e61a4ed9d2d29ddd78e407ad5e30684bfeb9a741a838f6c747c5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries voted on Wednesday to hold production to 30 million barrels a day.,9200fb04-61cf-50d1-acdb-ef7db3fc68ab,N24News/imgs/9200fb04-61cf-50d1-acdb-ef7db3fc68ab.jpg,24

Media,How ABC Found a Surprise Hit in 'The Good Doctor',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/19/business/media/the-good-doctor-abc.html,"Daniel Dae Kim was wide awake and scrolling through Twitter at 4 a.m. when he realized ""The Good Doctor"" was going to be a hit. It was a Tuesday in September, and Mr. Kim, a 49-year-old actor known for his work on ""Hawaii Five-0"" and ""Lost,"" found himself in bed in western Bulgaria not far from the set of ""Hellboy,"" a movie he was filming for release next year. He had a special interest in ""The Good Doctor,"" because it represented his first outing in a new role: executive producer. And so, although he had to go to work in just a few hours, he could not keep himself from checking the effusive social-media reaction to the show's premiere episode on ABC. When Mr. Kim stumbled onto the ""Hellboy"" set in the morning, he felt just fine. ""I've lived with this project since 2013, so one night of lost sleep wasn't going to make a difference,"" he said, laughing.

The tweets Mr. Kim scrolled through that night would soon give way to hard data: ABC's ""The Good Doctor"" is the most watched drama on network television. With roughly 17 million viewers for each episode, according to the Nielsen ratings, it draws a bigger audience than the CBS crime show ""NCIS"" and NBC's weepy ""This is Us."" The surprise hit has been a boon to ABC, which has been stuck in last place among the big four networks. It also came as sweet relief to Mr. Kim, who had spent three years developing this adaptation of a South Korean show through his 3AD production company. ""The Good Doctor"" is a big-hearted medical drama with a twist: The lead character, a brilliant resident played by Freddie Highmore, is autistic. In addition to learning how to become a skilled surgeon, he must figure out how to communicate with skeptical colleagues and confused patients. ""What's the point of sarcasm?"" he asks in an early episode.

""This could have been terrible in the wrong hands, or lesser hands,"" said David Shore, an executive producer on the series, of Mr. Highmore. ""He brings a humanity to this character that isn't necessarily on the page."" On Dec. 4, the show will wrap the first half of its improbably successful debut season. For every medical-genre hit like the NBC juggernaut ""ER"" or the ABC stalwart ""Grey's Anatomy,"" there are scores that never make it past season one (Remember ""Heartbeat,"" ""Trauma"" or ""Mercy?"" No one else does, either.) Mr. Kim took notice of the original version of ""The Good Doctor,"" an award-winning 20-episode series in South Korea, not long after it started airing in 2013. He scooped up the rights for his new production company and got to work adapting it. Because he was a star of the CBS show ""Hawaii Five-0"" at the time, he developed it for his home network, which ordered up a script. After taking a look, however, CBS decided against commissioning a pilot. That is usually the stage when all parties agree to leave a project behind, but Mr. Kim, who was born in South Korea and grew up in Bethlehem, Pa., bought back the rights from CBS. He felt that strongly about it.
* $15 minimum wage for federal contractors will take effect Jan. 30.
* Jeff Bezos gives $100 million to the Obama Foundation. He eventually teamed up with Sony's television arm, which brought in Mr. Shore, the creator of the successful Fox medical drama ""House."" Mr. Shore's version began to attract network interest -- although not from CBS. ""CBS actually passed on it twice,"" Mr. Kim said. ""That was really unfortunate to me, because they were my home studio. I really wanted to bring something home to them.""

Earlier this year, along with his Asian-American co-star, Grace Park, Mr. Kim left ""Hawaii Five-0"" after he suggested that they had not been not offered salaries commensurate with those of their white co-stars. ""The path to equality is never easy,"" Mr. Kim wrote in a Facebook post at the time. In the end, CBS lost a prime time actor and ABC gained an executive producer who brought it an unexpected hit. The network needed it. For the last two years ABC has been in last place among the four broadcast networks in the 18- to 49-year-old demographic that is important to advertisers. To make matters worse, Shonda Rhimes, the showrunner behind the ABC hits ""Scandal"" and ""Grey's Anatomy,"" decided to make Netflix her home for all future projects. Robert Iger, the chief executive of Disney, ABC's parent company, did not mince words when he described his disappointment with the network earlier this month, saying, ""Some improvement from a quality aspect would be helpful."" The show is partly the result of a programming strategy that ABC hit upon last year, after heartland voters had a strong hand in the election of President Trump -- a strategy focused on ""not just appealing to both coasts,"" said Ben Sherwood, the president of the Disney and ABC television group. ""Roseanne,"" the ABC comedy about a working class family that lit up the Nielsen ratings during its nine-season run? Reboot it! ""American Idol,"" a politics-free singing contest that lasted 14 years on Fox before going off the air in 2016? Revive it! As for other programming, the network decided on a new game plan. ""One of our goals was to move away from cable fare, or living in that dark world of antiheroes,"" said Channing Dungey, the president of ABC Entertainment who started last year. ""What people are looking for in broadcast is brighter, lighter, more hopeful.""

Indeed, ABC executives and producers for the show are convinced that Dr. Shaun Murphy, the main character of ""The Good Doctor,"" plays to a wide audience because he is innocent and never meanspirited. While the median age of the show's viewers is 58, according to Nielsen, it is also popular among teenage girls. ""He's a hero we haven't really seen lately,"" Mr. Shore said of Dr. Murphy. ""He's overcoming things he was born with. He's not a drinker. He's not a womanizer. He's not an antihero."" Mr. Kim said it was perhaps a ""blessing in disguise"" that ""The Good Doctor"" did not get picked up in, say, 2014, when it may have fallen flat. ""There a lot of shows that have a deeply cynical take on the world,"" Mr. Kim said. ""This is not one of them. Given what I was reading every day in newspapers or seeing on my TV, I felt it was very much needed counterprogramming to reality.""",The actor Daniel Dae Kim — in his new role as executive producer — was turned down twice by CBS before landing the show at the last-place network.,a279a56d-57be-527a-9b8d-ce44ca2fbea3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/20/business/20GOODDOCTOR3/20GOODDOCTOR3-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=c6c21a3e9c6882e68d90f3de7d070e723dd779c4e226b74f13847d785524eab6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Daniel Dae Kim, an actor on ""Hawaii Five-0,"" developed ""The Good Doctor"" while he was part of the cast of ""Hawaii Five-0"" on CBS, but the network passed on the project.

Music,"Yes, We Need (Yet) Another Rachmaninoff Recording",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/03/arts/music/daniil-trifonov-rachmaninof.html,"The standard repertory in classical music is often standard for good reason: Great works are gifts that keep on giving with repeated hearings.

But what about repeated recordings? It's one thing to hear young pianists take on Rachmaninoff's mighty Third Piano Concerto in concert, with its in-the-moment excitement. But do they really need to record it?

After all, the market is saturated with several dozen recordings. I grew up with Van Cliburn's classic live one from Carnegie Hall, with Kirill Kondrashin conducting the Symphony of the Air, shortly after Cliburn had become an overnight superstar after winning the Tchaikovsky Competition in Moscow.

Just three years later, Byron Janis, another young American, recorded the concerto with Antal Dorati and the London Symphony Orchestra, a performance some Rachmaninoff devotees consider even better. And the exhilarating, exhausting discography piled up, with spectacular older accounts by Horowitz, Kapell, Argerich and others, and more recent ones by Leif Ove Andsnes and Evgeny Kissin.

Movies,'Terminator: Dark Fate' Review: It's Hasta la Vista All Over Again,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/30/movies/terminator-dark-fate-review.html,"""My name's Tim Miller, and I'm the director of 'Terminator-- Dark Fate.' This scene starts in Dani Ramos and Diego Ramos's workplace. They go to work at the factory where they're making cars, and the terminator is tracking them there as well as Grace, the protector. So, you know, there are things that are hallmarks of the 'Terminator' movies, and then there are things where we feel like we could go freestyle and change things and bring something new. So the fight has this rhythm to it. There's a whole lot of moments in it, but I think my favorite moments are really the Grace-ascendant moments where she has this sledgehammer and she's just beatin' the crap out of the Rev-9. And I think it's really the first time you see just how strong she is. We shot this in two locations that is supposed to feel like one. We shot the wider shots and some of the chase parts of the scene at a Mercedes factory outside of Budapest in Hungary. But in the middle, we go into an assembly line area where we have the main area of the fight. And when that happens, we're transitioning onto a set that was built on stage at Origo Studios in Hungary. And the reason we did that is because for stunts you really want a controlled environment because if people are going to get thrown on floors and into walls and onto work benches and have engines fall on them--"" ""My name is Grace.""

Books,Jerzy Kosinski Stars in a Novel About His Own Strange Life,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/29/books/review/jerzy-jerome-charyn.html,"You can find him on YouTube talking to David Letterman or Johnny Carson -- a celebrity novelist. Although at a certain point Jerzy Kosinski became more than that, or something different: one of those hard-to-place figures, not quite funny but not exactly the butt of the joke either. A professional oddball. Letterman doesn't quite know what to do with him and treats Kosinski like the weird foreign uncle a well-brought-up young man should be nice to. But Kosinski played other roles too: Holocaust survivor, con man, sex fiend, Hollywood actor, seer, a guy on the make.

Jerome Charyn's new novel covers much of the usual life story, though not in the usual order. Born Jewish, Kosinski grew up in Poland and survived World War II, when he was said to have been taken in by local Roman Catholics. There are stories that he served as an altar boy in church. Some of these experiences made their way into his breakthrough novel, ""The Painted Bird"" -- about a Polish boy who escapes the Nazis by wandering from village to village, where he is, as Charyn puts it, ""beaten many times, left to drown in an ice hole, hung from the rafters of a barn."" The book was banned in Poland but made its author famous in America, and what followed was a peculiar kind of American success story: lecture gigs at Yale and Princeton, marriage to a wealthy widow, a divorce and another marriage, affairs, more novels, the inevitable backlash, a cameo in Warren Beatty's ""Reds."" Then, abruptly, suicide, at the age of 57.

Kosinski is a slippery figure to write about, since the facts have gotten mixed up in his fictions. Accusations of plagiarism and dishonesty -- and his and others' defenses against both -- have further muddied the waters. But all this confusion is really grist to Charyn's mill. He's not trying to tell the story straight.","Jerome Charyn's novel ""Jerzy"" is based on the very slippery life of Jerzy Kosinski.",856add00-5d08-5f97-87cf-2a7b32cf7b30,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/02/books/review/02Markovitz/02Markovitz-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=4a9d87b1e7b0cdc813817fdfa470c25be2bbaf6277bb7c264a4bcdb3c0f63593&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jerzy Kosinski in 1982.,856add00-5d08-5f97-87cf-2a7b32cf7b30,N24News/imgs/856add00-5d08-5f97-87cf-2a7b32cf7b30.jpg,13

This Weekend",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/21/arts/music/pop-rock-and-jazz-in-nyc-this-week.html," KADHJA BONET at Elsewhere (June 28, 8 p.m.). Ms. Bonet's new album, ""Childqueen,"" for which this Brooklyn appearance counts as one of two release shows, is R&B in the broadest sense, mixing dense, retro orchestration (she plays almost all the instruments on the album herself) with beachy eclecticism that recalls the group the Internet, who also hail from Los Angeles. Her bright, clean soprano makes the already-haunting music seem even more anachronistic, though whether it belongs to the future or the past is unclear. Either way, her sound is a refreshingly ambitious experiment with genre-defying results.

elsewherebrooklyn.com FLOATING POINTS at Analog BKNY (June 23, 10 p.m.). After a cursory listen to any music by Floating Points, the alias of the British electronic musician Sam Shepherd, you probably wouldn't be surprised to learn that Mr. Shepherd is also a neuroscientist: His records are, if nothing else, trippy. They combine jazz -- one of his first singles was a Sun Ra remix -- and garage with sprawling jams of synth-driven house and grungy post-rock. At this all-night D.J. set, expect heady grooves that can coax even the most contemplative fan onto the dance floor.

These New York experimentalists are performing in Brooklyn on the same day that they're releasing ""Kazuashita,"" their first new album since they released the critically acclaimed ""Eye Contact"" in 2011. Their sound this time around is more ambient and breezy, while the tone is more explicitly political. The raga and rock elements that made their earlier releases so psychedelic remain but with layers of poetry from their fellow downtown artist Jack Walls and audio from the Dakota Access Pipeline protests at the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.

LERA LYNN at Bowery Ballroom (June 27, 8 p.m.). Ms. Lynn's big break in 2015 was bigger than most: a recurring role on a prestige drama (the second season of HBO's ""True Detective"") and a prominent place on its T. Bone Burnett-produced soundtrack. On her 2016 album ""Resistor,"" she joined contemporary indie with moody 1960s country, and now she is touring in support of a new album of acoustic duets called ""Plays Well With Others"" (out on Friday) with artists such as John Paul White (the Civil Wars), Shovels & Rope and Rodney Crowell. Mr. White and Peter Bradley Adams open.

212-260-4700, mercuryeastpresents.com/boweryballroom MESHELL NDEGEOCELLO at Murmrr Theater (June 26, 8 p.m.). This singer and bassist has been a fixture in the space between R&B, jazz and funk since the early 1990s. On her new album, ""Ventriloquism,"" Ms. Ndegeocello revisits some of the biggest pop hits of that era, stripping them down to their reflective and occasionally melancholy cores. As an understated challenge to assumptions about genre and gender, the release fits easily with Ms. Ndegeocello's oeuvre, which has long made subversive ideas about music and culture sound approachable.

murmrr.com PARAMORE at Barclays Center (June 26, 7 p.m.). Keeping the attention of any audience after providing the soundtrack for its teen angst is a tall order. But Paramore -- who along with Panic! at the Disco and Fall Out Boy made the record label Fueled by Ramen the go-to for late-2000s pop-punk -- have managed so far, most recently turning to polished '80s synth-pop, which, while more mature, still doesn't sound out of place on a set list next to their early hits like ""Misery Business"" (2007) and ""Monster"" (2011). Foster the People and the one-woman act Soccer Mommy open, the latter of whom could draw a sizable crowd of her own thanks to the buzz around her new album, ""Clean.""

The 2018 edition of Pride Island -- the two-day festival that evolved from the longtime New York City Pride tradition Dance on the Pier -- is being called the biggest live music event in Pride history. Sunday's show, starring the dance-pop icon Kylie Minogue, is sold out, but tickets are still available for Saturday's set with the headliner Tove Lo. Also on Saturday's bill is the ambassador of New Orleans bounce, Big Freedia, whose latest foray into pop music's mainstream is a brief cameo on Drake's latest single, ""Nice for What."" Upbeat, strut-inspiring hip-hop from Lizzo and a performance by Sasha Velour, the reigning winner of ""RuPaul's Drag Race,"" complete the lineup.

ALTERNATIVE GUITAR SUMMIT at various locations (through June 24). The annual Alternative Guitar Summit gathers six-string improvisers from a broad range of styles and methodologies. This year's festival comes to a head on Friday night with Jazz-Rock-Funk Throwdown at Nublu 151 -- featuring the trio Harriet Tubman and the virtuoso guitarist David Fiuczynski -- and on Saturday evening with a concert of duets at the Jazz Gallery, with musicians playing together in pairs for the first time. On Saturday afternoon, Bill Frisell offers a workshop there.

alternativeguitarsummit.com JOANNE BRACKEEN WITH RICHIE GOODS at Mezzrow (June 22, 8 and 9:30 p.m.). Keenly articulated and brilliantly layered, the piano playing of Ms. Brackeen can feel both dazzling and intimate. Her compositions cram together a lot of ideas about misdirection, balance, blues comfort, melody and memory. While her recorded output has slowed of late, this National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master's performances remain a revelation. She performs at this intimate basement club with the bassist Mr. Goods.

646-476-4346, mezzrow.com JONATHAN FINLAYSON at Roulette (June 24, 8 p.m.). Mr. Finlayson is a thoughtful young trumpeter with a distinctive, forbearing voice as an improviser and a composer. At Roulette he debuts a set of music inspired by the writings of Sterling Brown, an influential figure in the Harlem Renaissance whose poetry and criticism helped to establish a critical discourse around black music in the United States. Mr. Finlayson is joined here by the baritone Andre Solomon Glover, the pianist David Bryant, the bassist Chris Tordini and the percussionist Craig Weinrib.

917-267-0368, roulette.org DAVID MURRAY AND CLASS STRUGGLE at the Village Vanguard (through June 24, 8:30 and 10:30 p.m.). Mr. Murray likes to throw his bawling, strident tenor saxophone sound into a range of situations. He recently assembled this cross-generational band, which plays his music with a flaying intensity and a stark sense of purpose that matches the name. The group -- which gave some stellar performances last year, when the lineup was slightly different -- now features the trombonist Craig Harris, the pianist Lafayette Gilchrist, the guitarist Mingus Murray (Mr. Murray's son), the bassist Rashaan Carter and the drummer Russell Carter. 

212-255-4037, villagevanguard.com R+R=NOW at the Prospect Park Bandshell (June 22, 7:30 p.m.). Here's the circular trap of the supergroup: If the players are respected entities, their calling cards already completed, how do they put something new on the line without sacrificing the reason they're there? Organized by the keyboardist Robert Glasper, this band seeks to solve the problem by taking on social issues through its music, though the ensemble's sound hardly feels militant: It wanders from cool confrontation to woozy ennui. In addition to Mr. Glasper, R+R=NOW includes the trumpeter Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah, the synth whiz and vocoder player Terrace Martin, the synth artist Taylor McFerrin, the bassist Derrick Hodge and the drummer Justin Tyson.

TEN at Murmrr Theater (June 25, 8 p.m.). At the time of her death in 2017, the renowned pianist Geri Allen was just entering an exciting chapter with the ACS Trio, a collective featuring the bassist Esperanza Spalding and the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington. In the past year, Ms. Spalding and Ms. Carrington have worked to find another outlet for the comfortable, seeking rapport they had developed in that group. Now with TEN, their new trio with the virtuoso trumpeter and sometime pianist Nicholas Payton, they seem on their way to becoming one of jazz's great working bands. The early concerts have had a biting, chancy energy.

Opinion,The Question All Democrats Need to Ask Themselves,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/09/opinion/democrats-2020-election.html,"Dionne, a Brookings Institution senior fellow and Washington Post columnist, tells a story about American politics that I find clarifying. In the past, thorny policy debates typically took place between the two parties. Examples include the best way to expand health insurance (through the private sector or government), control pollution (through taxes or regulations) and reduce the deficit (through spending cuts or tax increases).

Today the Republican Party has become so radicalized that it opposes almost any government action to solve problems. Its domestic agenda consists largely of cutting taxes for the rich and freeing companies from oversight. The substantive part of many policy debates now happens within the Democratic Party -- which means that tensions are only natural.

And yet progressives and moderate Democrats still agree on far more than they disagree. Each side would be more effective if it were open to learning from the other, Dionne writes, rather than lapsing into ""an unseemly moralism that feeds political superiority complexes.""

Progressives are right that over the past half century Democratic moderates have often allowed conservatives to dictate the terms of political conversation, on economic growth, criminal justice, family values and more. I'd add that moderates have also spent too much time designing technocratically elegant policies (like tax credits) rather than creating easily understandable, popular programs.

Moderates, for their part, are right that every great progressive victory in American history -- abolition, women's suffrage, the income tax, labor rights, Social Security, civil rights, Medicare, marriage equality and more -- has required compromise in the service of persuading allies who disagree with progressives on other issues. It's not enough to state your case purely and wait for a silent progressive majority to emerge as never before.

In the long run, each side is likely to accomplish much more if it can recognize that the other isn't the enemy. In the short run, obviously, there is an inescapable dilemma: The party can nominate only one person.

Before that choice is made -- while both sides are fighting hard for their preferred nominees, as they should -- they should pause to reflect on the strengths of the other side. For progressives, that means recognizing that moderate congressional candidates really did fare better in swing districts in 2018. It also means celebrating (quietly, for now, I realize) the progressivism of, say, Buttigieg's agenda.","If your preferred candidate doesn't win the nomination, will you still do everything you can to deny Trump a second term?",d9e74484-e06d-5d5a-9d90-dcde3e41c257,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/09/opinion/09Leonhardt/09Leonhardt-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3878e88be5e4eb7179fc432b25c3d48e6c702f241b55abc824aaf6f9dea3f1f6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, N.H., on Friday.",d9e74484-e06d-5d5a-9d90-dcde3e41c257,N24News/imgs/d9e74484-e06d-5d5a-9d90-dcde3e41c257.jpg,11
Travel,Carnival Plans Cruise to Cuba,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/travel/carnival-to-offer-cruise-to-cuba.html,"Carnival Corporation announced today that it plans to begin offering trips to Cuba next May aboard its new social-mission-focused line fathom.

The cruises to Cuba, approved by the U.S. Department of Commerce and the Treasury Department, fall under rules that allow licensed travel companies to bring in American visitors who comply with federal regulations for approved types of travel on the island, company officials said in a conference call. In this case that means cultural, artistic, faith-based and humanitarian exchanges between Americans and Cubans.

So unlike classic Caribbean cruises that celebrate sun and beach time, fathom passengers to Cuba will spend shore time engaging in social outreach and educational activities. Specific itineraries have yet to be determined, pending Cuban government approval, but will likely visit three destinations within Cuba during week-long trips. On-shore activities may include volunteer work with small businesses and agriculture as well as educational and cultural excursions.

""We believe there's a tremendous pent-up hunger in the marketplace and interest in experiencing Cuba for the first time, and so we're excited to see and share as much of the country as is possible,"" said Tara Russell, president of fathom.","The Carnival Corporation will offer cruises to Cuba under a new line called fathom.

Music,"3,000 Interviews. 50 Years. Listen to the History of American Music.",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/arts/music/yale-american-music.html,"In 1968, Vivian Perlis, a research librarian at Yale, knew that she needed to talk to Julian Myrick. A man who had spent his life in the insurance business was not the most likely of musicological sources. But Myrick's business partner had not only been significant in the field of life insurance, but was also one of the most important figures in American music history: the composer Charles Ives, who had died 14 years earlier. ""He was writing music at the time when I first knew him,"" Myrick recalled to Perlis, in a Southern drawl. ""He worked very hard at it, but people couldn't understand it."" Myrick was only the beginning of what became Perlis's landmark resource, celebrating its 50th anniversary this season: Yale University's Oral History of American Music. Over the following years, Perlis sought out more of Ives's friends and acquaintances. ""I searched for the oldest and most fragile Ives survivors and often found myself in hospitals and rest homes waiting for an aged Yale classmate or Ives relative to wake from a nap to tell his story,"" she would later recall. She even tracked down the barber who cut Ives's hair: a man nicknamed Babe, who hadn't known that his patron was a composer but did remember that Ives once yelled at him to shut off the radio. Perlis assembled these and other recollections into a groundbreaking 1974 book, ""Charles Ives Remembered: An Oral History.""

For the most part, the Oral History of American Music, known as OHAM, has focused not on insurance salesmen or barbers, but has instead gone straight to the source: living American composers, who sit for interviews that can last many hours. The archive has grown to encompass recordings of around 3,000 interviews with major voices in American music. ""When you talk to people, they have this sense of their own value in a way that they haven't before,"" Libby Van Cleve, an oboist and the director of OHAM, said in an interview in January at her office at Yale. Perlis died last year at 91; Ms. Van Cleve became director of the oral history project in 2010, when Perlis retired.

Perlis, with a similarly inquisitive temperament and an elegant presence, made it her life's mission to record the voices of American composers. She conducted many hours of interviews with Aaron Copland; after he saw the transcripts, he realized they could form the basis for the book he always meant to write, which became a two-volume autobiography. She spoke to Nadia Boulanger, the famed French composition teacher, on her 90th birthday in 1977. Boulanger claimed at first that she was too tired to talk, but once Perlis mentioned that she brought greetings from Copland, the grande dame described her pedagogical philosophy in detail.

Perlis foraged for mushrooms during a rainstorm with John Cage. She talked with ragtime composer Eubie Blake, who recounted growing up the son of slaves and bringing his pioneering musical ""Shuffle Along"" to Broadway in 1921. (He refused to use the word ""jazz"" in the interview because he believed it was uncouth to say in front of a woman.) Perlis managed to track down Leo Ornstein -- who had been renowned for giving recitals of his radical piano works in the 1910s but had long since vanished into obscurity -- in a trailer park in Texas. After Duke Ellington died, OHAM conducted more than 90 interviews with friends, family, and collaborators, yielding a rich collection of essential jazz arcana. (Excerpts from these and other interviews are compiled in the 2005 book ""Composers' Voices from Ives to Ellington,"" by Perlis and Ms. Van Cleve.)

For many years, OHAM was located in a basement at the Yale School of Music, stuffed with shelves of tape. Today, its headquarters is tucked away on the third floor of the university's Sterling Memorial Library, through a series of corridors that wind past an Egyptology reading room and an archive for the papers of James Boswell. A blown-up photograph of a young, suave-looking Aaron Copland greets visitors. OHAM's relationship with its parent institution is stronger today than in the past -- it is officially part of Yale's Irving S. Gilmore Music Library -- and it doesn't need as much space as it once did, as reel-to-reel tape has given way to digitization.

In 1986, David Lang, then a 29-year-old grad student at Yale, spoke to OHAM for several hours: The recording provides a full portrait of a whip-smart, loquacious composer who describes his dissatisfaction with academia, his love of Berlioz's viola concerto ""Harold in Italy,"" and his earliest experiments in composition: writing trombone parts to play alongside his father's recordings of Beethoven's violin sonatas. A decade later, Mr. Lang talked with Ms. Van Cleve about why he and his colleagues Michael Gordon and Julia Wolfe chose to forego conventional career paths in favor of starting their own renegade organization, Bang on a Can. In 2011, he spoke again with Ms. Van Cleve, three years after he unexpectedly won the Pulitzer Prize. ""I am now generally regarded as a successful composer, but it was not very long ago that I was regarded as a barbarian,"" he says, trying to come to terms with the direction his life has taken. Multiple stages of a composer's path are captured on tape. It's a biographer's dream.

There are limits to OHAM's approach. When the two-volume Copland autobiography was published, it was criticized for being too discreet: It omitted any mention of the composer's sexual orientation, because Copland didn't talk about it in the interviews. Once an interview is completed and transcribed, the transcripts are shared with the subjects. They are allowed make small corrections, like fixing incorrect dates or facts. Not all musicians like to see their candid moments written down. Ms. Van Cleve recalled that, despite her clear instructions, one prominent composer liberally took a red pen to his transcript and completely rewrote large passages -- and even invoiced Yale for the work. As an outfit, OHAM remains slim: Ms. Van Cleve works alongside a research archivist, Anne Rhodes, and is assisted by a bevy of student workers. They have made OHAM's materials more easily available than ever before: Most recordings and transcripts can be requested, without charge, through their website. (Such requests are temporarily limited to the Yale community because of limited resources during the pandemic.) But while the texts will be sent on request, they cannot be downloaded: While making sure they remain accessible to scholars, aficionados, and the general public, Van Cleve wants to insulate the interviews -- in which composers often tell candid, personal stories they wouldn't necessarily give to journalists -- from popping up all over the internet.","Vivian Perlis founded Yale's Oral History of American Music in 1968.

Theater,Eavesdropping on Warhol and Capote,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/30/theater/eavesdropping-on-warhol-and-capote.html,"""I thought I could turn these tapes into plays and they'd be my little fortune,"" Warhol said in his diary in 1985, but Capote had died the year before and the project never got realized. In 2007, when Mr. Roth noticed the diary entry and learned that the tapes had survived, he was determined to bring the concept to life: ""I had to uncover the idea, but it's Andy's idea.""

For decades, the Andy Warhol Foundation has denied almost all access to the 3,000 cassettes that Warhol recorded of his daily talk: His gossip could sometimes veer into slander, bringing a risk of lawsuits. To get his hands on Warhol's Capote tapes, Mr. Roth said he had to agree to indemnify the foundation, to give it full script approval and also a joint author's share of the profits. And then he had to reach the same kind of arrangement with the Capote estate. In the end, there was no need to worry about slander in recordings that were mostly, Mr. Roth said, ""two guys gossiping about stuff."" (Although the play does include a tall tale from Capote about going to bed with Humphrey Bogart.) In fact, the first dozen tapes that Mr. Roth listened to left him doubting that there was gold to be mined there. Then one day, on a 1978 recording, Mr. Roth, 54, heard Warhol say this to Capote: ""Let's write a new play. Gee, Truman, can't I just tape you?"" Mr. Roth realized his own play would be all about letting us watch Warhol and Capote collaborate on a first, live draft of theirs.

With 8,000 pages of transcripts, it took Mr. Roth a year to extract the 600-or-so snippets of talk that held promise, and then years more to assemble them into a compelling picture. ""I'm excited for people to know more about these two people,"" he said. ""I grew to love them even more in doing this."" On the first day of rehearsals in August, the actor Leslie Jordan said he already has a deep connection to Capote. As a little boy who was taunted as a ""fairy,"" he said, seeing the flamboyant author on TV triggered such a shock of recognition that Mr. Jordan ran to the bathroom to vomit. He could hardly be more perfectly cast for the role, he said: ""I'm Southern, I'm gay, I'm little - I get Ma'am'd a lot on the phone."" (On Sept. 7, Mr. Jordan withdrew from the production for personal reasons. Dan Butler will play Truman Capote instead.) Opposite him onstage (Michael Mayer is directing) will be a Warhol played by Stephen Spinella, a two-time Tony winner for ""Angels in America."" As Mr. Jordan told his bathroom story -- hamming it up, Capote-style -- the lanky Mr. Spinella listened in silent, Warhol-ish observation. He said he didn't have such a personal connection to his character, partly because of his admiration for him: ""I'm playing somebody who has a way of seeing the world that is so much more interesting and revelatory than the way I see the world."" His challenge, said Mr. Spinella, would be to reveal a ""real"" Warhol inside a creator so controlled and self-conscious that he was always playing some kind of part. Mr. Roth's own crush on Warhol blossomed when he first saw the artist assuming a role. In 1985 Warhol appeared, as some version of himself, on ""The Love Boat,"" a favorite TV program of Mr. Roth's throughout his youth in New Jersey. ""I related to him -- an outsider, a geek,"" he explained.

Mr. Roth's career in theater began with a degree in drama and then writing and directing live shows for Disney theme parks. It exploded in 1992, when Disney agreed to let him concoct a musical based on its animated movie ""Beauty and the Beast."" The result was a vast hit, and Mr. Roth (then known as Robert Jess Roth) spent the next several decades staging the show around the world. That reliable, profitable gig eventually gave him the luxury of spending almost every non-""Beauty"" minute digging into the Warhol tapes. Early on, he discovered that the recordings might work as the bones of his play, ""but it needed a bit more meat on it."" He imported a fresh supply of Capotean eloquence from published interviews; he mined new, more extended Warholisms out of the artist's books, some of whose words come from the pens of ghostwriters. ""You can't play the tapes and hear the play, at all,"" Mr. Roth admitted. For all the genius of his heroes' conversation, ""they needed help making it into a Broadway play,"" he said. (Capote himself has been center stage there before, with Robert Morse winning a Tony in the one-man ""Tru."") Mr. Roth's years at Disney had taught him that a show needed drama and emotion to speak to an audience, so he arranged his material to supply both. That may turn out to be his riskiest move. Warhol once published a novel based on taped conversations, and, like so much of his art, it was radical: Readers were left to drown in verbatim ""ums"" and ""uhhs."" To channel Warhol's true notion of a tape-recorded play, ""WARHOLCAPOTE"" will need to baffle its viewers as well as please them. If it appears with a full quotient of Mr. Roth's ""drama and emotion,"" it may attract the Broadway audience he is hoping for after the A.R.T. run. But also the ire of two colorful critics looking down from on high.

On that first day of the rehearsal, however, Mr. Mayer was already feeling an urge to nudge Mr. Roth's script away from naturalism and toward something more ""abstract,"" as he put it, using one of Warhol's favorite words. It was almost as if the artist had put it in his mouth.",A playwright mines drama from 80 hours of taped chatter between the artist and the writer.,1d840924-d1a0-5c30-bbe5-24ef3ab18cda,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/03/arts/03WARHOLPLAY1/03WARHOLPLAY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=7b5ea28ff54e8ed36b0b6e7d3d2c325c68cc187390bd1f479c874043c58a09ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Rob Roth, relaxing in his Manhattan apartment, is the author of ""WARHOLCAPOTE,"" a play which grows out of his lifelong fascination with both Andy Warhol and Truman Capote.",1d840924-d1a0-5c30-bbe5-24ef3ab18cda,N24News/imgs/1d840924-d1a0-5c30-bbe5-24ef3ab18cda.jpg,10
Theater,Rebuilding a Broadway Theater With American Voices,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/20/theater/second-stage-center-theater-group-for-new-american-plays-on-broadway.html,"In a move that promises to bring a more diverse mix of voices to Broadway, a nonprofit theater company announced on Thursday that it had commissioned work from nine critically acclaimed playwrights, part of its pledge to present living American writers on New York's most prestigious stages. ""No Brits. No Chekhov translations. No classics,"" vowed Carole Rothman, the artistic director of Second Stage Theater, which acquired Broadway's smallest theater in 2015, and is now renovating the building for reuse starting next spring. Ms. Rothman said her theater is supporting new works by the nine playwrights -- seven of them women, three of them African-American, and one of them Asian-American -- with the intention of bringing the shows to Broadway. Six of the works will have initial productions in Los Angeles, at the Center Theater Group, under an unusual collaboration intended to smooth the developmental journey for American playwrights. Broadway has become a difficult landscape for American writers creating new plays, chiefly because of the high cost of producing shows there. The heavy percentage of tourists in the overall audience means that theater owners and producers lean toward razzle-dazzle musicals and classic revivals with a better shot at becoming profitable. Even nonprofit theaters on Broadway -- and six of the 41 houses are now run by nonprofits -- often, although not exclusively, mount large musicals and starry revivals.

But Second Stage has a rare opportunity to try something different because the theater it bought -- the Helen Hayes -- has only 585 seats, which is quite small for Broadway, and which can be partly filled with the nonprofit's subscribers rather than relying heavily on tourists. The $22 million theater renovation, by the architect David Rockwell, is being financed as part of a $64 million fund-raising drive by the theater, which has raised 76 percent of that goal thus far. Broadway productions matter to playwrights not just because of the prestige -- only Broadway shows are eligible for Tony Awards -- but also because work presented there is often staged around the country and the world. Lynn Nottage, who has won two Pulitzer Prizes, for ""Sweat"" and for ""Ruined,"" and is one of the writers commissioned by Second Stage, said the endeavor will open doors to female and minority playwrights, who are underrepresented on Broadway. ""One of the major obstacles that we had to getting to Broadway is economics, and this tears down that barrier for us,"" she said. ""Commercial producers are more frightened of plays that are topical or political or a little dangerous, and Second Stage is not going to have those same kinds of constrictions."" In one early indication that the nonprofit's acquisition of a Broadway house will be attractive to a range of artists, Ms. Rothman also announced that the movie star Chris Evans (""Captain America"") had agreed to make his Broadway debut in the first production at the reopened theater next spring. He will perform alongside Michael Cera (""Arrested Development"") in a production of ""Lobby Hero,"" written by Kenneth Lonergan (who just won an Oscar for the screenplay of ""Manchester By the Sea"") and directed by Trip Cullman. Mr. Cera's Broadway debut came in 2014 in a revival of Mr. Lonergan's ""This Is Our Youth."" ""Lobby Hero,"" which will begin next March, will be followed by a production in July 2018 of ""Straight White Men,"" written by Young Jean Lee and directed by Anna D. Shapiro. Ms. Lee would be the first Asian-American woman to have a play produced on Broadway.

""On the one hand, that's great, but it's also like, 'Oh, why hasn't there been another Asian-American female on Broadway?'"" Ms. Lee said. But the most potentially game-changing aspect of the Second Stage plan is its effort to create a pipeline to Broadway for living American writers. Other nonprofits routinely commission plays by many of the same people, and only sometimes those works transfer to Broadway. The Second Stage initiative is unusual in creating an explicit pathway to Broadway, with a preliminary production elsewhere and then, if all goes well, a transfer to the Helen Hayes. The theater has not only underwritten work from nine well-regarded writers (six of whom have previously worked on Broadway), but it has negotiated partnerships with three other entities to jointly commission and help develop those works before Broadway. The most significant partnership is with Center Theater Group, one of the largest nonprofit theaters in the country, which has commissioned, with Second Stage, six of the writers, including Ms. Nottage and another Pulitzer winner, Paula Vogel (""Indecent""); the Tony winner Lisa Kron (""Fun Home""); as well as Jon Robin Baitz (""Other Desert Cities""), Will Eno (""The Realistic Joneses"") and Ms. Lee. All but Ms. Lee have had work on Broadway, Ms. Nottage and Ms. Vogel only this year, after long careers. Center Theater Group also announced Thursday separate partnerships with the Goodman Theater in Chicago, and the National and Royal Court theaters in London, to commission new works that would have multiple productions. ""I will get a wider variety and a greater quality and quantity of good plays for my audience,"" said Michael Ritchie, the artistic director of the Los Angeles theater.","Second Stage, a nonprofit theater, will program Helen Hayes Theater with work by living American playwrights.",697c3bd1-dc5e-5593-8066-5e1def406489,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/21/arts/21second-print/21second-print-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=ee945e36526248f3e31656eeaf802e1140219eb09d7eaa5db71f21c010b0d564&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Young Jean Lee, right, the writer of ""Straight White Men,"" with its director, Anna Shapiro, at a news conference on Wednesday at the Helen Hayes Theater.

Your Money,A Bespoke Perfume Doesn't Come Cheap,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/14/your-money/designing-personal-perfumes.html,"As part of a trip to France in 1984 to study floral painting, Dianne Bernhard spent time in Monet's gardens at Giverny. It was there, among the flowers that inspired him, that she heard Cartier was creating a new perfume in Paris made with jasmine, roses and vanilla. ""I said, 'I'm going to go straight to Cartier as soon as I get out of class,' "" said Mrs. Bernhard, a painter and former president of the National Arts Club in New York. ""I loved the smell."" The fragrance she found there was a musk, but she didn't like how it smelled on her skin. But instead of giving up, she had a chemist begin mixing, and he ended up creating the scent that Mrs. Bernhard -- and only Mrs. Bernhard -- has worn for the last three decades. ""It was just something that became me,"" she said. ""If the scent of this woman changed, my grandchildren, my family and many of my close friends would be sad.""

When most people think of bespoke goods, they think shirts, suits, wedding gowns, maybe an haute couture dress. But bespoke perfume takes the world of personalization to an entirely new level. For starters, it costs a lot to find the right mix of flowers and oils to create a smell particular to you. Thomas Fontaine, a perfumer at Jean Patou who helped revive Joy, a perfume that has been around for eight decades, and create Joy Forever, said it could cost someone $30,000 to $50,000 to create a personal scent. ""The most expensive thing is the development,"" he said. ""To create a fragrance for only one person or one million people, the cost is the same."" In contrast, Joy is a comparative bargain at $800 an ounce. But taste is tough to price. Mrs. Bernhard said her perfume had certainly not been cheap over the years. She said it cost several thousand dollars for the scent to be created, back in 1984, and over the years, it has cost the equivalent of several hundred dollars a bottle.

Laurent Le Guernec, a perfumer at International Flavors and Fragrances, a large perfume creator, and the recipient of eight awards for perfume design, said the challenge was always to personalize it. When he created Lovely, a scent for the actress Sarah Jessica Parker, the perfume was meant to appeal to the millions of fans who wanted to smell just like her. But what was that scent? ""She was creating something for herself and hoped other people would like it,"" he said. ""She had a very lavender oil, a musk oil and that was basically it. And she said, 'Can you do something like that?' "" Each year, about a thousand fragrances are created and introduced by perfume companies in a similar way, up from about 90 scents in the 1970s, said Elizabeth Musmanno, president of the Fragrance Foundation, a perfume industry group. Given that selection -- on top of existing perfumes -- Ms. Musmanno questioned the need for a bespoke scent in the first place. ""While I think it's very interesting for certain people to try, it's also kind of the equivalent of me hiring a great chef and telling him how to cook,"" she said. ""You need training for years and years to begin to be able to smell the difference in certain fragrances. For a lot of money you could come out with something that isn't any better than what is on the market today."" For those who want to try, it begins with a conversation. Audrey Gruss, a former marketing and advertising executive, is just beginning the process of creating a fragrance. She has a name -- Hope Springs Eternal -- and a purpose -- to bring in donations to the Hope for Depression Research Foundation. She founded the charity eight years ago to find ways to battle depression, which plagued her mother, Hope. Mrs. Gruss's sense of smell is already refined. ""I have a white flower garden in our summer home,"" she said. ""I love jasmine, freesia and lily of the valley.""

""Some of those fragrances can be relaxing and soothing and uplifting,"" she said. ""We don't profess to practice medicine without a license, but the idea of aromatherapy has been quite well documented."" These days, no scent is unattainable. Mr. LeGuernec occasionally auctions off his perfume-making skills for charity. He remembers his strangest project. ""A lady said, 'I really want to make a perfume that smells like my horse,'"" he recalled. ""I said, 'Whoa.' "" While the winning bidder was a serious equestrian, she didn't want to smell like a stable but something redolent of her love of riding, which began in childhood.

""That kind of challenge I don't get every day,"" he said. ""There is not a big brand that wants to launch a fragrance that smells like a horse. But in the end it was very sensual."" He described what they created as musky and leathery, with orange blossom as the dominant floral scent. Most of the time, of course, people would like to smell like a memory -- a spring day in the mountains or the breeze off a favorite lake. But the struggle is one of translation: Perfumer and customer often do not speak the same language. One is describing something ephemeral; the other is trying to translate that into flowers and oils. ""When it's bad, you're starting to speak a lot to know what they mean and what they're expecting,"" Mr. Fontaine of Jean Patou said. ""It's the same problem you have if you're working on a project or a brand and they don't know what they want to sell to the consumer."" Typically, it takes six months to a year to create a scent and at least half a dozen meetings. But that is predicated on the person having enough time to devote to the process, which even some of New York's most soignee socialites do not want to expend. Muffie Potter Aston said she had been wearing the same perfume -- Fracas by Robert Piguet -- since high school, with occasional dalliances with other scents. ""The olfactory nerve brings back all the memories of smells,"" she said. ""My mother wore Joy and Chanel No. 5, and if I smell someone wearing Joy or Chanel No. 5, I think of my mother. My grandmother wore Shalimar. If I smell someone wearing Shalimar, I think of my grandmother.""

Yet when Mrs. Potter Aston first started wearing Fracas, it was a scent she could get only in Paris. ""If I had a friend going to Europe or I was going to Europe, I always made sure I brought a bottle back,"" she said. ""Perfume doesn't last forever. You can't just go and buy 10 bottles. It's elusive."" But once Fracas became available at Neiman Marcus, the scent was less appealing to her. And now a couple of her friends on the New York social circuit also wear the scent. She has been contemplating working with Kilian Hennessy, a perfumer living in Paris and descendant of the founder of the Hennessy Cognac company, to create her signature scent.

""That's right: The queen's gift for Donald Trump was a book. Either she doesn't know Trump or she's trolling him. Why would you give Donald Trump a book? Everyone knows the man doesn't read! I wish I was there when the queen gave him his gift. She's like, 'Here you go, Donald, a book about World War II.' He's like, 'Wow, this is sad.' 'Yes, many lives were lost.' 'No, I mean the fact that I have to read, it's so sad!'"" -- TREVOR NOAH ""The queen also led Trump on a tour of the royal collection where he learned about British history. [As Trump] 'Enough books, Liz. Boring. Show me the wizards. I know you've got them around here someplace.'"" -- STEPHEN COLBERT

In an interview with Axios that aired Sunday night, Jared Kushner was asked if he thought his father-in-law was racist, using Trump's birtherism in reference to President Barack Obama as an example. Kushner responded that he ""wasn't involved"" and therefore could not comment.

""That's an interesting way to think of racism: You can only identify it if you see it firsthand. 'Was slavery racist?' 'I don't know, man! I wasn't there, O.K.? I've just heard good things, I wasn't there!'"" -- TREVOR NOAH ""But seriously, how is Jared so bad at lying? He is around Trump all the time. You would think that he would practice.

""Unlike President Obama, President Trump was not invited to stay at Buckingham Palace. Yeah, when asked why, the queen said, 'We're worried about our property value.'"" -- CONAN O'BRIEN ""Really? All 52 bedrooms in Buckingham Palace are being renovated at the same time? All of them? Come on, man! Like, I know you don't want Trump to stay there, but that's a terrible excuse, because now I'm picturing the queen being like, 'Donald, I really tried to get you a room, but the manager said no.

Health,"Ebola Likely to Spread From Congo to Uganda, W.H.O. Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/health/ebola-congo-uganda.html,"Ebola Likely to Spread From Congo to Uganda, W.H.O. Says 
* None 

The risk of Ebola escaping from the Democratic Republic of Congo is now ""very high,"" and the outbreak already is nearing Uganda, the World Health Organization said on Thursday. The W.H.O. raised its official alert level because of violence by local militias, which has slowed efforts to contain the outbreak, and population movements in eastern Congo, where the latest outbreak erupted in August. But the risk of Ebola spreading globally remains low, the agency said. Since 2000, Uganda has had three Ebola outbreaks, with a total of about 600 cases. Although it is a poor country, its health care system is relatively well organized, and its health ministry said it would start a vaccination campaign if it detected cases there. Inside Congo, the response to the outbreak has been hampered by fighting and by small numbers of victims leaving or refusing to go to treatment centers, spreading the virus to new areas. Also, local politicians exploiting the fear and confusion ahead of December elections were encouraging people to distrust the national government's efforts, Dr. Peter Salama, the W.H.O.'s head of emergency response, said at a news conference in Geneva, Reuters reported. In the coming weeks, problems like those could ""create a potential perfect storm,"" Dr. Salama said. As of Friday, there have been 155 confirmed or probable cases in the Ebola outbreak. Some 102 patients have died, and 45 cured patients have been released. In a video statement, Congo's health minister, Dr. Oly Ilunga Kalenga, said the outbreak was now three times the size of the one this summer in the central Equateur Province. He blamed several factors. More people live in the affected area, and they are more mobile because they are mostly traders rather than farmers. The region has better roads and water connections, but is more dangerous because many militias operate in it. Nearly 12,000 health workers and contacts of known victims have been vaccinated. Although cases of Ebola continued to decline and only about 10 new ones are detected each week, the W.H.O. expressed alarm that one had turned up for the first time in Tshomia, a fishing town across Lake Albert from Uganda. Refugees often flee across the lake; just this year, 75,000 Congolese crossed it into Uganda to escape fighting in Ituri province, of which Tshomia is a part, according to a report from the European Commission's humanitarian aid organization. Officials in Ituri said the case was a woman who had attended the funeral of an early Ebola victim in Beni, where the current outbreak began. She was being followed as a case contact, but she refused to be vaccinated, slipped away in between visits from medical workers, and traveled about 75 miles north before falling ill. She visited a traditional healer and a rural clinic before ultimately dying in the Tshomia regional hospital on Sept. 20. More than 100 people in contact with her are now being vaccinated, and the mud-walled local clinic she visited had to be decontaminated. Although health workers have not been targeted, 21 people were killed last week in Beni. An Islamic fundamentalist militia known as the Allied Democratic Forces was blamed. The group has a history of cross-border fighting with the Ugandan army, attacks on United Nations peacekeepers and massacres of civilians. After the killings, medical staff were told to stop working for 48 hours; their subsequent efforts were hampered by a four-day mourning period declared by local officials, the W.H.O. said. Many rumors about Ebola are circulating and must be debunked, according to the health ministry's Twitter feed. They include reports that prisoners with Ebola had escaped from the Beni prison, that children were being vaccinated without their parents' consent, and that schoolgirls who had their menstrual periods were being forced into treatment centers. Four Ebola treatment centers have now been built, and a treatment team has arrived in Tshomia.",Local fighting and fleeing patients led the organization to increase its alert level. The disease has appeared in a Congolese fishing village near Uganda.,1374f8b3-40cf-5272-ad74-9b0f61eca088,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/09/29/science/29EBOLA/29EBOLA-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=a0be5917c7b2cff81159bd05bfa1fa0e331ea823fdffabb673fdfc3cde5fac59&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Medical staff in Bundibugyo, Uganda, near Congo's border, investigate a suspected Ebola case.",1374f8b3-40cf-5272-ad74-9b0f61eca088,N24News/imgs/1374f8b3-40cf-5272-ad74-9b0f61eca088.jpg,1
Style,"Peter Gatien, the '90s 'Club King,' Wants His Final Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/style/peter-gatien-limelight-tunnel-club-kid.html,"""Thoughts flash in your mind of incredible nights here, whether it was Jay-Z, or Junior Vasquez, or the thousands of people inside and outside, waiting in line,"" said Peter Gatien, the nightclub impresario who lorded over the 1990s club scene in New York City. It was a brisk Wednesday in early March, a few days before the city shut down because of the new coronavirus, and Mr. Gatien was at La Colombe, a cafe inside the brick warehouse that once housed the Tunnel, the massive nightclub on West 27th Street that is now celebrated as a crucible of hip-hop. ""Just the raw energy, the exuberance,"" he said, sipping an iced tea. ""You don't see it anymore."" Times change. The Tunnel, a former warehouse where Biggie Smalls and Busta Rhymes once barked out raps to frenzied throngs, is converting to offices and luxury retail, blending seamlessly with the gleaming Hudson Yards to the north.

With his memoir, ""The Club King,"" published on April 1, he hopes for a degree of catharsis after an epic rise and fall, but also to celebrate a lost New York, when clubs felt mysterious and transgressive, luring the misfits and outcasts from the city's creative underground, and every night felt like a Mardi Gras on Mars. ""It was the last of an era: predigital, pre-social media,"" he said. ""People didn't even have cellphones. You really had to go out to find out what was happening."" Mr. Gatien, too, no longer looks quite so swashbuckling, his razor cheekbones now softer, his eye patch (worn since childhood, after he lost an eye in a baseball game in which a broomstick was being used as a bat) now replaced by dark glasses. Wearing a vintage Gaultier spring coat over a black hoodie, with oversize white headphones cradling his neck, he seemed at ease just to blend in. ""I like being anonymous,"" he said. Over the past two decades, he has certainly accomplished that. Mr. Gatien was acquitted of his drug-racketeering and conspiracy charge in 1998 but was deported to Canada after pleading guilty to subsequent state tax-evasion charges. He now lives a quiet life in a three-bedroom apartment in Toronto with his third wife, Alessandra, and has spent the bulk of the last two decades trying to put his life back together.

And a 2011 documentary, ""Limelight,"" offered a kaleidoscopic look back to that sordid netherworld, but Mr. Gatien was not exactly effusive in the film. ""Perched palely on a tall stool, rocking dark sunglasses or his signature eye patch,"" the New York Times review read, the gangly club kingpin ""remains largely an enigma."" Even so, the memoir provides Mr. Gatien a chance to set the record straight. Portrayed over the years as a genius and a hustler, a megalomaniac and a Sphinx, he is looking forward to the chance to control the narrative for a change. ""If you only read The New York Post from 1996 to 2000, then I'm a villain,"" he said. ""It hurts. I was a hard-working guy who spent nearly 20 years in nightlife in the city.""

But, he added, ""I was an easy target. I was the guy in the eye patch."" Whatever else you may say about Mr. Gatien, who is 68, he never aimed small. He opened his first club in the mill town of Cornwall, Ontario, when he was in his early 20s and managed to lure a young band from Toronto band by the name of Rush for its opening week, he says in the book. He later moved to Miami, where he converted a nightclub called Rum Bottoms into a discotheque called Limelight, and booked rising acts like Grace Jones and the Village People. In following years, he opened Limelights in Chicago, London and Atlanta, where, he writes in his book, a live panther briefly roamed beneath a tempered glass dance floor. The stunt prompted the ire of a local animal rights organization, but the buzz also lured the likes of Rod Stewart and Andy Warhol, he writes.

Along with goths, drag queens, rockers, leather boys and slumming socialites, the Limelight became the home to the '90s club kid moment. Arty outsiders and fashion iconoclasts favoring lip piercings and pancake makeup reframed dance-floor revelry as an art movement of sorts -- a swirling blend of techno music, Carnival-level costumery and, yes, drugs (particularly Ecstasy). ""I'm a good shepherd,"" Mr. Gatien said. ""I was a shepherd of talent. I always got a lot of gratification standing in the back of the balcony, seeing 3,000 below waving their hands in the air."" At Limelight, he added, ""we had people in sequins showing up alongside people in tuxedos coming from a dinner at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. If everybody is dressed in Armani, it's boring. If everybody is super-sequins, it's boring. The most important thing you can do in a club is to draw an eclectic crowd. In the end, they entertain each other."" Mr. Gatien found success in his adopted city, but he did not find universal love. The Village Voice called him ""a bit of a cold fish."" New York magazine described him as ""a provincial money man who didn't make the scene, but made a fortune off it."" Even his staff nicknamed him ""the Ghost."" ""I don't know if it's because I'm a small-town Canadian kid,"" he said, ""but I'm much more comfortable in the shadows."" The Tunnel, too, served as a clubhouse for a marginalized population in need of one, he said. Located in a neighborhood that was then an industrial backwater, the club provided a safe space in downtown Manhattan for large groups of young African-Americans.

As Datwon Thomas, the editor of Vibe, wrote in 2018: ""You couldn't go to the notoriously badass function that took place on Sunday nights if you were faint of heart. Meanwhile, you weren't a top-tier rapper if you didn't perform at the perpetually packed venue."" With Funkmaster Flex wrangling talent, big names including Dr. Dre, Lil' Kim, 50 Cent, Missy Elliott, Jay-Z, Nas and Snoop Dogg all played Sunday night at the Tunnel. And they played for free, Mr. Gatien said, because, well, it was Sunday night at the Tunnel. It was the days before bottle service, and the Tunnel was also a place for the elites of rap to scale the heights of conspicuous consumption. Leaning over the massive bar at the center of the room, Sean Combs and Jermaine Dupri used to compete to see who could line up more empty Cristal bottles, Mr. Gatien writes in the book. ""Everybody was dancing,"" Mr. Gatien said. ""Even the security girls, once the rush was over. And when everybody was leaving the place, there were so many smiles."" He remembers thinking, he said, that everyone who had been at the club was going to have sex that night. It would not last, however. None of it would. ""The owner of three of Manhattan's largest nightclubs was accused yesterday of turning two of them -- the Limelight and the Tunnel -- into virtual drug supermarkets,"" The New York Times reported on May 16, 1996, ""peddling the drug known as Ecstasy to a clientele made up largely of college students and teen-agers.""

When police raided the Limelight in the fall of 1995, his empire was living on borrowed time. As the investigation widened, undercover agents were soon swarming Limelight, some, he writes in the book, dressed in highly unconvincing drag, or wearing dog collars. After his arrest, the legal odyssey lasted two and a half years until he was acquitted of all drug charges in 1998. Jurors ""clearly rejected the testimony of a drug-dealing former club director and five other dealers who pleaded guilty to drug-conspiracy charges and agreed to testify against Mr. Gatien in return for leniency,"" The Times reported. Even so, the government found a way to get rid of him, deporting him to Toronto in 2003 after his guilty plea to state tax evasion charges. (He paid some club employees in cash.) On visits to New York in the ensuing years, he has made a point of avoiding the former Limelight church, which over the years has housed boutiques, restaurants and a gym. ""It's very emotional for me,"" he said. ""I had it for almost 20 years. That's like an eternity in the nightclub business. Most clubs -- a year and a half, two years, and that's it."" While he has entertained the idea of getting an investment group together and creating a boutique hotel, with the Limelight building as the lobby, he will never return to the nightclub business, he said. ""I've been approached by Vegas,"" he said. ""I don't even respond to the calls. It's a young man's game.""",The Limelight and Tunnel are long gone. But the story of their vilified owner is still being written.,afc98081-c77c-5f47-b0d7-f045c28573c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/04/09/fashion/02gatien6/02gatien6-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=95cb0c7952c3e81d61b108906c4dc7344a76855447987bc0f7a2523c6d923172&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Social butterfly: The nightclub mogul Peter Gatien, right, with George Michael in New York City in the late 1980s.",afc98081-c77c-5f47-b0d7-f045c28573c9,N24News/imgs/afc98081-c77c-5f47-b0d7-f045c28573c9.jpg,15
Food,"Charred, Browned, Blackened: The Dark Lure of Burned Food",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/24/dining/burned-food-charred-browned-blackened.html,"Smoke is shorthand for culinary catastrophe, setting off alarms in the kitchen and jitters in nervous cooks. But some foods will reward you for pushing them right over the edge, past done and headed toward burned. ""My burning method of choice is the broiler,"" said the chef Gerardo Gonzalez, who draws inspiration from traditional Mexican moles to make his own at Lalo, the restaurant he opened last fall in Chinatown in Manhattan. Mr. Gonzalez starts his mole with almonds, cashews, peanuts and pumpkinseeds, which are all toasted zealously, to the darkest possible shade of brown. ""Just before they go black,"" he said.

A great kazandibi, the Turkish milk pudding, requires a totally scorched bottom to fulfill its delicious potential, the milk pushed to the same shade as a fire-licked marshmallow. Any dessert that relies on a touch of burned sugar, from flan to creme brulee, will go limp and lifeless if that caramel is cooked too lightly. And there are few primal delights like the burned ends of a barbecued brisket, crisp-edged and fierce with smoke. Mr. Gonzalez, 34, who was raised in San Diego by parents from Jalisco, Mexico, first toyed with burning when he cooked at El Rey Coffee Bar & Luncheonette, a cafe on the Lower East Side that developed a cult following while he was in the kitchen. Cole Wilson for The New York Times He says Mexican cuisine has taught him how incorporating a burned vegetable or fruit, like onion or citrus, into vegetarian dishes will produce a serious, almost meatlike depth of flavor.

His mole, cooked down with charred tomatillos, onions and oranges, is based on the flavors of his youth, plumped up with the body and sweetness of dried apricots and plums. He deploys it in small amounts to intensify a bowl of hominy in broth. ""A friend told me it reminded them of a stew their Jamaican grandma used to make, but there are people who still don't get it,"" Mr. Gonzalez lamented. He has tweaked the dish a few times since Lalo opened, hoping to find an audience for the mole's intense flavors. Mr. Gonzalez draws inspiration from traditional Mexican moles to make his own at Lalo. Cole Wilson for The New York Times Mr. Gonzalez himself is mindful of the potential health risks in some browned foods; he generally avoids deeply charring meats because of studies that show it produces chemicals that can increase the risk of cancer. Britain's Food Standards Agency warned this week against browning starchy foods like bread and potatoes because cooking them at high temperatures produces acrylamide, which has been linked to cancer in animals. Researchers are still studying whether the chemical affects health in humans. The Food and Drug Administration has said it is not clear if the low levels of acrylamide found in food may be a health risk, especially if eaten in small amounts. Many people have a taste for thoroughly browned foods, crusty corners and inky, bittersweet edges -- in moderation. When I was growing up, my mother, who is Indian, embossed her soft chapatis with tiny, crisp bubbles of black char, the pattern like a signature. The most coveted one in the stack was always the darkest, shining with clarified butter.

To understand the appeal of these strategically charred foods, I spoke with Andrea Nguyen, 47, a cookbook author and cooking teacher who lives in Santa Cruz, Calif. She said it was a matter of both taste and looks. ""Charred food always draws you in more, whets your appetite,"" she said. It's why nuoc mau, a burned caramel sauce, is used to elegantly expand both flavor and color in traditional Vietnamese cooking. Sugar is cooked with a little water until it is past golden, smoking and rushing toward a glowing dark russet. The caramel is added in small amounts to marinades, or pots of simmering meat, which it infuses with umami, bringing a savory sweetness along with a touch of bitterness. It is not just a one-dimensional burned flavor, but what Ms. Nguyen called ""a liquid replication of the charred effect.""

""It's not for ice cream,"" she added. Nuoc mau was developed by resourceful Vietnamese cooks with simple stoves, she said. Using clay pots, they didn't always have the luxury of browning foods as they cooked. The sauce served as a kind of replacement for the Maillard reaction, the chemical dance between amino acids and sugars that produces distinct savory notes in browned foods. ""It allowed them to create big flavors using limited resources,"" Ms. Nguyen said. Cooks throughout the Caribbean also use a sauce of burned sugar, known as browning, to amplify savory flavors. Though the chef Rawlston Williams doesn't draw attention to it on the menu at his Brooklyn restaurant, the Food Sermon, he uses browning to marinate and braise lamb shanks, mimicking the coloring and elemental flavor of meats roasted over a fire.

""The longer it heats, the deeper and more pronounced the caramel becomes in the dish,"" he said. ""I don't like it to become too profound. I like it to be a little more subtle."" Mr. Williams, 40, learned to use browning as a child in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. While neighbors employed the technique in meat dishes, as well as in the molasses-colored fruitcake known as black cake, in Mr. Williams's vegetarian household, it was often used to perk up the taste of seitan, a meat substitute he made from scratch. Caramelizing the sugar thoroughly, burning it yet not completely blackening it, is the key to an effective browning sauce, no matter how it's being used. It is through caramelization that the vapid sweetness of sugar becomes interesting. Mr. Williams learned to use browning as a child in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Cole Wilson for The New York Times As sugar turns from pale gold to brown, the chemical reactions result in new flavors: acidity, tang and alcoholic notes, along with a more nuanced sweetness. They also introduce a little bitterness, which can add dimension. ""Everyone is so afraid of burning things,"" the Canadian author Jennifer McLagan said. ""But when you're burning, you're creating all of these different compounds that make food more complex in taste, and much more interesting to eat.""

For her 2014 cookbook, ""Bitter: A Taste of the World's Most Dangerous Flavor,"" Ms. McLagan, 63, developed a recipe for toast soup, based on a French country dish that stretches leftover bread into a meal. What sounds like a sad Dickensian sort of ration is in fact a strong case for burning good sourdough. Ms. McLagan's version starts with a base of bacon-infused chicken stock. She adds bread, so diligently carbonized that your average toast prude might be tempted to carry it to the sink and scrape it clean with a knife. (Resist, please.) Once ripped into pieces, soggy with stock, the toast is blitzed until smooth with a little hot milk and mustard, totally reconfiguring the burned flavor, diluting it into something more gently smoky, mellow and comforting. Ms. McLagan warned against undertoasting the bread, which results in a tasteless soup. ""Of course, you don't want it totally acrid,"" she said, ""but you do want to burn it a little."" The toast should be blackened on its edges and deep brown all over. Exercised with care, the dark arts of burning can conjure a world of flavor. But cooks have to push things a little further than usual, to fight their instincts and ignore the flutter of panic that sets in when food goes beyond a textbook golden brown into darker terrain, and curls of smoke send a warning that something has gone terribly wrong. ""When I'm pulling something from the salamander, someone is always walking by saying, 'Uh-oh, somebody burned something!'"" Mr. Gonzalez said. ""I'm like, 'Yes, that's the whole point.'""","Chefs are pushing the envelope, inspired by traditions from around the world. With a little daring, home cooks can, too.",59eb8598-e09a-550c-859e-610c037366f5,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/01/25/dining/25BURNED2/25BURNED2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=ceb05853f9224ff58259dd5bf2c1b7014b79e5dd06bf3ac882c48ce30386a99a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The chef Gerardo Gonzalez chars vegetables for his burned-almond mole, which he serves with hominy and octopus at Lalo, the restaurant he opened last fall in Chinatown in Manhattan.",59eb8598-e09a-550c-859e-610c037366f5,N24News/imgs/59eb8598-e09a-550c-859e-610c037366f5.jpg,17
Automobiles,"Efficiency, Imported From Europe",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/automobiles/efficiency-imported-from-europe.html,"The makers of plug-in hybrids and E.V.'s have reaped billions of dollars in federal loans and energy grants. Buyers of the electrically enabled vehicles have also been given bountiful perks, from tax credits and the privilege of high-occupancy vehicle lanes to home charging units underwritten by taxpayers. Yet vehicles that were once the antithesis of eco-friendly are making far deeper inroads with mainstream consumers: fuel-sipping, ultralong-range diesel cars. Attracted by newly quiet and clean-running engines that deliver some 15 to 30 percent better mileage than their gasoline counterparts, Americans flocked to diesels in 2012. Sales of diesel passenger cars and S.U.V.'s jumped by nearly 26 percent from 2011. That's despite the stubbornly high price of diesel fuel that, at $3.87 a gallon on average, is 23 cents more than regular gas (but a penny less than premium grade). Given that reality, some automakers are wondering out loud why new-school diesel cars -- which in some cases burn even less fuel and produce lower levels of global-warming gases than hybrids -- are getting no love or largess from Washington.

""This planet will not be rescued by superexpensive technology for the few, but when the majority of mobility is clean,"" said Rainer Michel, vice president for product planning at Volkswagen of America. ""Diesel is far less expensive than plug-ins and E.V.'s, with better range and performance. This technology is available today."" That assessment might be expected from VW or another automaker based in Europe, where roughly half of all new cars are frugal diesels. One in five new VWs sold in the United States today is diesel-powered, making the company by far the nation's leader. But with automakers on a steep climb to the federal fuel economy target of 54.5 m.p.g. for 2025, even domestic automakers can no longer afford to ignore a technology with so much potential. For instance, the new Chevrolet Cruze Diesel, carrying a 46-m.p.g. federal highway rating, is officially the highest-mileage nonhybrid sold in America. The Mazda 6 Skyactiv-D sedan goes on sale this year. A Cadillac ATS diesel is in the works. The Jeep Grand Cherokee EcoDiesel, powered by a turbo V-6 with Fiat connections, is arriving in dealers. Jeep executives may expand that engine's availability, perhaps to the all-new 2014 Cherokee or a 2015 Wrangler. Ford's Transit commercial van will also get diesel power.

Despite remarkable advances in mainstream gasoline engines, the combustion cycle developed by Rudolf Diesel at the end of the 19th century continues to be more fuel-efficient. For one, diesel engines squeeze the air in their cylinders to such pressures that the injected fuel ignites with no need for an electric spark. And gallon-for-gallon, diesel fuel contains some 12 percent more energy than gasoline. The upshot: diesels consume about 15 to 30 percent less fuel over all. Owners of heavy-duty pickups have long relied on these durable, hard-working engines, which have the reputation for running 300,000 miles and more. This fall, the 2014 Ram -- among the mileage leaders on the gasoline side -- will become the only light-duty pickup to offer a diesel, a 3-liter V-6 shared with Jeep. That innovation, in a pickup class that accounts for more than a million sales each year, is sure to be closely watched by Ford and Chevy. About 6.7 million diesel vehicles were on American roads in 2012, according to R. L. Polk registration data, but barely 800,000 of those were passenger cars and S.U.V.'s; heavy-duty pickups and vans account for most of the remainder. That compares with 2.3 million registered hybrid models. The number of available diesel car and S.U.V. models is expected to double by the end of 2014, to 34 from 17, according to the Diesel Technology Forum. An industry analysis firm, LMC Automotive, projects that diesel market share will double by 2018, from 3.7 percent to 7.5 percent. That would rival the 8.7 percent for all hybrids and plug-ins combined. And battery-only E.V.'s? They're expected to capture just 0.6 percent of sales. The Germans are going all out. New Bluetec versions of the GLK-Class crossover and C-Class sedan will give Mercedes-Benz eight diesel models in its 2014 American lineup, including the E250 Bluetec, a 4-cylinder version of the E-Class sedan. BMW will drop a 4-cylinder turbodiesel capable of 45 m.p.g. highway in its 2014 328d sedan and xDrive Sports Wagon in August, joining the X5 xDrive 35d S.U.V. and 535d midsize sedan in showrooms. Porsche, too, offers a diesel, in the Cayenne S.U.V.

VW foresees increasing diesel sales to at least 30 percent of its total American sales. Within three years, Audi hopes to roughly triple its American diesel penetration, to nearly one in five sales. Like Audi, VW has publicly committed to offering a TDI diesel option for all of its mainstream models. The A8 TDI luxury sedan has joined the Q7 TDI S.U.V. in showrooms. This summer brings TDI versions of the Q5 crossover, A6 sedan and A7 premium hatchback. A new A3 TDI comes early next year. The fuel economy edge of diesel vehicles is most notable at higher speeds, making them a wise choice for Americans who commute long distances on highways. Hybrids, in contrast, shine in urban and suburban driving, where battery power and regenerative braking help them beat diesel mileage by a wide margin. But in terms of driving enjoyment, it's no contest: diesels, with their powerful surge of low-end torque, make typical hybrids feel slow and spiritless in comparison. In widely publicized cases, the real-world mileage numbers of some hybrids have been a disappointment. Owners of the Ford C-Max and Fusion Hybrid have filed class-action lawsuits over window-sticker ratings that proved overblown. That has focused attention on the E.P.A.'s testing regime, which seems to credit hybrids for illusory mileage while understating diesel efficiency. ""You'll never find a diesel driver complaining that they're not getting the posted mileage,"" said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum. ""They all brag that they're doing better."" Such pleasant surprises have been borne out in my own testing. Several VW car models can achieve 50 highway m.p.g., whipping their 40- to 43-m.p.g. federal ratings. The Chevy Cruze Diesel showed 49 highway m.p.g., beating its 46 m.p.g. estimate. The Mercedes GLK 250 Bluetec, rated at 33 m.p.g. highway, returned 37. Notably, diesels do their thing without the hassle or inconvenience of hybridlike driving tricks, including obsessively avoiding the gas pedal. ""You don't have to drive gingerly,"" said Doug Skorupski, manager of technical strategy for VW of America. ""You can drive normally and still get big numbers.""

The limo-size Audi A8 TDI sedan, in my testing, delivered 39 m.p.g. even at a 70-m.p.h. cruise, 3 m.p.g. above its estimate. Diesels, analysts add, also pay back owners with higher resale values than comparable gas models, and with driving ranges that read like misprints. The Audi A8 TDI can cover more than 800 highway miles, enough to drive from Chicago to New York without stopping for fuel. (Don't try that in an E.V.). Chevy's Cruze can top 700 miles. A clever VW television ad shows two friends learning to speak Spanish fluently in the 13 hours and nearly 800 miles it takes to drain the Passat TDI's tank. One long-held assumption -- that Americans have bad memories of dirty, smoky, unreliable diesels of the '70s and '80s -- isn't supported by current research, automakers say. Most consumers are decades removed from diesel's Dark Ages. ""Younger buyers, especially, don't have those notions of what diesel was like,"" said Wayne Killen, general manager of product strategy for Audi of America. The real barriers include unpredictable diesel prices, concerns over convenient access to filling stations and unfamiliarity with the technology. Diesel, Mr. Killen said, is still below the radar for many mainstream shoppers, even those seeking better mileage. Yet many objections are being washed away. About 52 percent of America's gas stations now have at least one diesel pump. The technology, said Mike Omotoso, an LMC Automotive analyst, adds roughly $1,500 to $3,000 to the price of a gasoline car, but the gap is shrinking.","Plug-in hybrids and E.V.'s seem to get all the attention, and the tax breaks. But diesel engines are also fuel efficient, and technology has tamed the emissions problem.",c6b4b7ba-2c44-50d9-8206-3e06c725efbf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/07/21/automobiles/Diesel1/Diesel1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=305&w=600&s=bd1d9d354b88a1959e6af32390cfbaf9ba2054ce50ab0e1a1baf5798a693330b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"TRANSATLANTIC Europe's lead in the diesel sales boom is built on fuel-sipping models, including the 2014 Audi A6 TDI.",c6b4b7ba-2c44-50d9-8206-3e06c725efbf,N24News/imgs/c6b4b7ba-2c44-50d9-8206-3e06c725efbf.jpg,23
Your Money,"Sometimes Golden Oldies Means the Band, Not the Music",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/24/your-money/getting-the-band-back-together-for-the-golden-years.html,"A 4-YEAR-OLD GIRL twirled and jumped in what is normally a parking lot to the music of Monko, telling her mother it was her favorite band. Monko, named after its singer-songwriter-guitarist Kevin Monko, was playing under an awning at the east end of the weekend Collingswood Farmers Market, hard by the elevated tracks of the commuter train from the New Jersey town of Collingswood to Philadelphia, about six miles away. Mr. Monko, 58, is a commercial photographer who just happens to love putting bands together. This one has a bass player, a mandolin man, a drummer and himself. ""When I am playing music, I can't get much happier,"" Mr. Monko said. ""All of the people who play with me are better than me. I am lucky enough to get people to play with me in a variety of bands and we go play in different places, make a little money, and just have a lot of fun.""

Mr. Monko is just one of many baby boomers who, near or at retirement age, are trying to recapture their musical youth; if not exactly expecting Taylor Swiftian riches, they are at least hoping for modest remuneration and a place in the lights. ""Boomers have been imagining life stages since they were born,"" said Emilio Pardo, president of an AARP division called Life Reimagined. ""They always want to embrace what they feel is their calling. It is no surprise that as they have gotten older, they have reached out to their musical pasts."" There was a time, in his 20s, when Mr. Monko worked a variable schedule in restaurants, when he thought he might be lucky enough to not just make a little side cash, as he does now, but maybe make a real living playing music. Then life, as it so often does, intruded, and he started on a different career path, married, had a couple of children and moved to the suburbs and away from the music scene. It did not quite gnaw at him, but the thought of playing remained with him. Little by little, mandolin players and trombonists came into his life again, if more in his spare time than before. Since then, he has released a CD of his quirky semi-rock music, and he plays at farmers' markets and coffeehouses and the occasional party. Paul Stiegler, 63, was an enthusiastic member of a campus a cappella group at Carleton College in Minnesota in the early 1970s, and he once even competed in a hollering contest in the Great Smoky Mountains. He never really thought of basing a career on his vocal prowess, though, and became an emergency room doctor and medical clinic owner.

He took some vocal lessons in the 1990s and played parts in community musical theater, but in 2007, Craig Kaemmer, an old friend from Carleton, sent him a CD he had made. ""I talked to him on the phone for two hours and got hooked,"" said Mr. Stiegler, who then took time off work to go to Nashville to take songwriting classes. By 2013, he had a CD of his own, a cross between country and soft rock. He performs when he can, mostly around Madison, Wis., where he now lives, and gets support from a songwriting association he found online and from a Nashville-based mentor.
* Locast, a nonprofit streaming service for local TV, is shutting down
* Capital One's chief executive was fined after being called a 'repeat offender.' ""That is another difference between the generation before and now, in regards to music or anything like that,"" Mr. Pardo of AARP said. ""You can go online and find someone who has done it, or is trying to do it. There is a support in social media, at the least, and you can connect with others in a way your parents couldn't."" Tom Moon didn't have any trouble with connections. For more than two decades, he was the rock music critic for, first, The Miami Herald and then The Philadelphia Inquirer, often contributing work to NPR and major magazines. While at the University of Miami, and just after, he played saxophone in a number of salsa bands -- often for only $50 a night -- so when the writing gigs started, he went all in. When he got to Philadelphia in the late 1980s, in fact, he signed an agreement that he would not play music professionally, so as not to compromise his reviewing. In 2004, though, he took a buyout to write a book, and when he finished the book in 2008, he felt a little lost trying to return to his journalistic career. ""I found myself picking up my horn and that is when I started to play,"" Mr. Moon said. ""I became convinced I had sold myself short as a musician. I was not a great talent, but I could play."" He began to go to jam sessions in Philadelphia and found that what he called ""young and vastly talented"" people from local universities wanted to play with ""the old guy."" Now 54, he plays several times a week in the better Philadelphia jazz clubs, sometimes still making $50 a gig, but often earning several hundred dollars a show.

""These young guys threw me a lifeline,"" Mr. Moon said. ""The odds against anyone, not just someone old, making it are great, but to play something beautiful, there is a value in that. I can appreciate it all the more having had the long-term perspective."" Jack Scott, 67, practiced law for 37 years in Wallingford, roughly 15 miles from Philadelphia, but for the last 12 years he has been playing the guitar he put down as a teenager. He performs at least once a week in a bluegrass club. He also teams with a fiddle player, charging $300 for gigs, ""though sometimes, of course, we have to take a little less."" It is hardly what he made practicing insurance law, but for now it is at least as satisfying. ""I don't want to be some guy with a guitar at an open mike,"" said Mr. Scott, who also writes his own bluegrass songs and sometimes teaches a class in songwriting at Temple University. ""It's funny when someone hires us, they say the audience is going to want covers of songs. We 'yes' them to death, but when we get to the gig, we play my original songs, because they work. People come up to us afterwards and say, 'Where do these songs come from?' We know our act works and it is wonderful when it does."" Sometimes the return to music later in life is fortuitous. Soon after Roberta Foster, 60, of Whippany, N.J., retired from teaching four years ago, her husband, Allen, also 60, bought her a ukulele for Valentine's Day. ""I said, 'Where is my jewelry? Where is my chocolate?' "" Ms. Foster said. Her husband was a good amateur guitarist and he thought a ukulele, which is a little smaller and easier to pluck, would be a good starter instrument for her retirement. Ms. Foster gave it a try and ended up loving it. She found there was a ukulele jam in nearby Morristown the first Wednesday of every month. Now the couple play as a ukulele-guitar duo at nearby clubs, nursing homes and parties as the Long and Short of It, since he is 6-foot-4 and she is 5-foot-4. She has also done some recording. ""One day I was an elementary schoolteacher and now I am a professional musician,"" she said. ""All because my husband was smart enough to give me this crazy ukulele.""","Baby boomers are often picking up an instrument they put down decades ago, and some are starting a new career as their main one is coming to an end.",863f99db-74d0-599f-aa2d-1270b96ed609,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/01/24/business/retiring-web1/retiring-web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=a863e2e2165a34cf5eaa02236c3c6964729948d5ae14646b62b89500e2e5abf1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kevin Monko, performing with his glam rock band Candy Volcano.

Good morning. I wrote about corned beef for the Food section of The Times that we delivered to our subscribers this morning: a defense of its awesomeness, with a corned beef recipe and tips from chefs and smart kitchen people about how to make it great. I'm hoping that the article persuades you to make corned beef (it's easy!), and that this recipe for Irish tacos lets you off the hook on St. Patrick's Day, if you can't bear to finish the meat with boiled cabbage and carrots the way they do down at Foightin' Paddy's near the cab stand, to feed the revelers coming back from the parade.

Setting up the brisket and the brine won't take 20 minutes, not counting the shopping, and it will pay off at 10 times the investment when you pull it out five days later.

Science,Do Floppy-Eared Dogs Look Friendlier? The T.S.A. Thinks So,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/science/tsa-dog-ears-floppy.html,"Hundreds of dogs report for duty at airports across the country, trained to sniff out bombs and other explosives for the Transportation Security Administration. Many have ears that hang low, delightfully dangling around their faces. Some have ears that stand tall and upright, flickering at every sound. All have ears that are, of course, adorable -- a 12 out of 10, if you will. But the T.S.A. has made it clear that it has a preference. The agency said it favors floppy-eared dogs over pointy-eared dogs, especially in the jobs that require interacting with traveling passengers, because floppy-eared dogs appear friendlier and less aggressive. ""It presents just a little bit less of a concern,"" the T.S.A. administrator, David Pekoske, said last month during an event at Washington Dulles International Airport. ""Doesn't scare children.""

We know there are very important things going on at the T.S.A., like the fact that employees have been working without pay during the government shutdown. But the internet is nothing if not a vortex of outrage and animal content, so here we are, ready to discuss the shape and elasticity of dog ears.

About 70 percent of dogs in the T.S.A.'s canine program have floppy ears, including Labrador retrievers, German shorthaired pointers and Vizslas. Among dogs that screen and interact directly with passengers, nearly all are floppy-eared because those dogs are generally seen as ""friendly"" and ""good with all ages of people,"" said Chris Shelton, who manages the agency's Canine Training Center. The T.S.A. also uses some pointy-eared dogs, like Belgian Malinois and German shepherds. Though the agency said it was confident those dogs could do the job, too, some dog lovers did not take kindly to the T.S.A.'s stance. ""Seriously, TSA?"" one person wrote on Twitter, posting a photo of a pointy-eared dog named Indiana Bones with his toys. ""The only things that should fear Indiana Bones and his pointy ears are stuffed hedgehogs and tacos."" But is the T.S.A. right about floppy ears? Sort of.

 There is a scientific explanation for why humans associate floppy ears with friendly animal behavior.

Take the domestication of wild foxes as an example. In the late 1950s, a scientist in Russia named Dmitri K. Belyaev began an experiment, which is still continuing, to replicate the process of domestication in real time, selecting silver foxes for breeding based on one characteristic: their calmness and friendliness toward humans. Within about five generations, the foxes, which are in the canine family, began to act more domesticated, wagging their tails and licking people's hands. After about 10 generations, they started to develop floppy ears, Dr. Dugatkin said. ""The floppy ears, the curly tails and so on, all of those somehow came along for the ride when you choose only based on behavior,"" said Dr. Dugatkin, co-author of the book ""How to Tame a Fox (and Build a Dog)"" with Lyudmila Trut, a Russian researcher who has led the silver fox experiment for the past 60 years. Researchers have discovered that animals that are calmer and friendlier also have fewer neural crest cells, a type of stem cell that can grow to form other types of cells, including cartilage, Dr. Dugatkin said. ""When that manifests itself in ears,"" he said, ""you have ears that don't stand up as straight because they don't have as much cartilage."" So in an evolutionary sense, the T.S.A. is correct: ""People inherently think of these droopy ears as a more juvenilized, friendly kind of trait,"" Dr. Dugatkin said.",The T.S.A. said it favors floppy-eared dogs over pointy-eared dogs in airport jobs because floppy-eared dogs appear friendlier and less aggressive. There is a scientific explanation behind the perception.,05b885b0-71cf-5139-a900-031aea669d8f,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/01/10/us/10xp-tsa1/10xp-tsa1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2730d6a01dc3d2aa0529d0b094e5a7e50c9da4f6e0bbf3bb4d5d761482ed3d65&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"German shorthaired pointers are among the floppy-eared breeds the T.S.A. prefers for its canine program.

Well,Lessons From the Battlefield,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/17/well/live/military-medicine-doctors-lessons-from-the-battlefield.html,"Like anyone living in Boston in the spring of 2013, I remember where I was when I heard that bombs had gone off at the Boston Marathon finish line on Patriots' Day, April 15. Three people, including an 8-year-old boy, were killed instantly. More than 260 were injured, many critically -- bodies crushed, limbs shattered, arteries severed. A medical student at the time, I was in awe of the speed, purpose and composure with which emergency workers and medical personnel operated. Scores of patients were transported to eight nearby hospitals. The median time from blast to hospital was 11 minutes, and the first patients were in the operating room within 35 minutes. Every patient who reached a hospital survived. The story of that day and its painful aftermath is recounted in a new H.B.O. documentary, ""Marathon: The Patriots' Day Bombing,"" airing on Nov. 21. It follows several families as they piece together their lives: learning to live as amputees, struggling with post-traumatic stress, undergoing surgery after surgery. One newlywed couple, Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, find their future together transformed after each loses a leg from the blast, and they are among the civilians transferred to Walter Reed Medical Center. Ms. Kensky, an oncology nurse, ultimately has to have her other leg amputated as well. A year later, after countless hours of rehab, she and her husband attend the wedding of one of their fellow survivors.

""If I was going to try dancing on two high-heeled prosthetic legs,"" Ms. Kensky says in the film, ""I was going to be somewhere where there were seven other amputees to help scrape me up off the floor."" But the survivors' continued physical and psychological struggles raise a broader and more complicated question: How can we, as a country, care for civilian victims of terrorism when the trauma they experience is typically seen only in war? Treating injuries caused by bombs and shrapnel is far from routine for most doctors. And while Boston was as prepared as any major city could be, the quality of trauma care across the United States varies substantially, with large differences in expertise, triage and best practices. After suffering a trauma like a car crash, fall or fire, a patient is twice as likely to die at the worst trauma centers compared to the best. So in many regions, unlucky trauma victims become unlucky trauma patients. Yet trauma remains something of a secret epidemic. Trauma is the leading cause of death for Americans under 45, and the fourth leading cause of death over all -- accounting for more than $670 billion in medical costs a year. There are nearly 150,000 trauma deaths annually -- 20 percent of which could be prevented with optimal trauma care, according to the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. A new report from the academies suggests that we could substantially reduce the health and economic burden of trauma in the United States if we integrated insights from military care into civilian hospitals. Even as weapons have grown more deadly, the fatality rate for wounded soldiers has fallen significantly over time, from nearly 25 percent in Vietnam to less than 10 percent in Afghanistan and Iraq. From just 2005 to 2013, the percentage of soldiers who died because of their injuries was cut nearly in half -- an extraordinary accomplishment of military trauma care.

This didn't happen by chance. It's a result of years of battlefield leadership, systematic reflection and redesign of care delivery processes. New protocols to control bleeding and transfuse large quantities of blood have saved hemorrhaging patients, and more extensive use of tourniquets has improved survival rates. Telemedicine and web-based applications allow treatment teams real-time access to expert knowledge and critical information about patients before they arrive. Innovative surgical techniques have been designed to stabilize patients before they're transported. And strategic evacuation of injured soldiers, sometimes over thousands of miles, by trained transport teams allows patients to receive necessary care en route. Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, herself a combat veteran and blast survivor who lost both of her legs in the Iraq war, now wants those hard-won insights to permeate civilian trauma care. With input from Mr. Downes, she recently introduced a bill to bridge the expertise and resources of military doctors with those in civilian hospitals. ""There's this incredible brain trust and experience portfolio in the military,"" Mr. Downes told me recently. ""But it's only available to military personnel. Most people can't access it. We need to make sure everyone who needs it can get it."" Merging civilian and military trauma care would make it easier to consistently and uniformly collect information about treatments and outcomes, and allow for a central data registry that could lead to higher quality care. Another change would involve more seamless integration of the emergency services that patients receive before arriving at hospitals and the rehabilitation services they receive after their stay. And both systems would benefit if more military doctors practiced in civilian hospitals and more civilian patients received care in military hospitals, allowing military trauma teams to acquire and maintain the expertise needed to deliver specialized casualty care. ""In Boston, we've shown what happens when we band together,"" Mr. Downes said. ""We need to share this knowledge, and hopefully, that means injuries are prevented and lives are saved.""",Merging civilian and military trauma care would benefit doctors and patients alike.,81c7ec37-c515-5e9e-abed-f12fb33adb40,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/15/well/doctors-marathon-patrick-downes/doctors-marathon-patrick-downes-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=f751c3d87cc735979811b924ed7619511e02515bc16cf6c402e94fee0f42135e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Patrick Downes, who survived the Boston Marathon bombing, gets ready for a training run in Cambridge, Mass., in April.",81c7ec37-c515-5e9e-abed-f12fb33adb40,N24News/imgs/81c7ec37-c515-5e9e-abed-f12fb33adb40.jpg,18
Theater,"In Solo Shows, Lip-Syncing 'Hamlet' and Investigating Home Movies",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/09/theater/in-solo-shows-lip-syncing-hamlet-and-investigating-home-movies.html,"In its 14 years, the Public Theater's Under the Radar festival, curated by Mark Russell, has brought theater artists to New York from 42 countries. But more important than their varied provenance is their diversity of style, which even an organization as catholic as the Public cannot hope to replicate in its regular season. So it's especially nice that this year, with most of the 26 offerings weighing in at less than 90 minutes, it's easy to catch several in a swoop during the festival's 12 days. (It officially ends on Jan. 15, though a few productions linger.) On Saturday I saw two, both of them one-man shows: ""Margarete,"" from Poland, and ""Re-Member Me,"" from England. Even separated by a palate-cleansing dinner at the Public's in-house restaurant, the Library, they were freakishly unalike, each complicating the experience of the other and reshaping my idea of what constitutes theater in the first place. You might expect ""Re-Member Me,"" by Dickie Beau, to be the genre bender: It's self-consciously eclectic, combining elements of drag, lip-sync, shadow play and tribute. But it is ""Margarete,"" by Janek Turkowski, that feels, despite its deceptively homey aspect, more profoundly experimental.

The gesture is both disarming and thematic. It was at a German flea market, we learn, that Mr. Turkowski, who often works with found video, bought for 20 euros the trove of eight-millimeter-film reels he now begins to project. Genially, self-deprecatingly and in charmingly accented English -- he pronounces the ""w"" in ""answer"" -- he tells the story of how he became captivated by what are evidently someone's silent home movies. But whose? And why should we care? Even overlaid with lovely recorded music (by Roger Anklam and Przemek Radar Olszewski), the films do not at first seem fascinating, filled as they are with banal images of people en route to Eastern European tourist sites in what seems to be the late 1950s or early 1960s. Here is a bus! Here's a cruise ship! Here's a brutal Soviet-style building called (we are mordantly told) the ""finger of culture""! But the finger of culture points in unexpected directions; as Mr. Turkowski becomes fascinated with one particular figure who appears in much of the footage, so do we. She is a white-haired woman he provisionally calls Margarete, and the bulk of the play's 55 minutes consists of his sometimes comical attempt to pin down her real identity and understand the meaning of her movies. One scene, which Mr. Turkowski repeatedly replays on a video transfer and enlarges for study as if it were the Zapruder film, suggests, at least to our credulous host, a possible spy mission at a nuclear facility. Another hints at a gender transformation. I won't say what Mr. Turkowski eventually discovers; the revelation may not be on the scale of a Cold War thriller but in its ordinariness turns out to be just as exciting. Or rather: exciting and sad, as old family mementos so often are. (The found-audio mystery ""Say Something Bunny!"" has a similar setup.) It seems that humans must look for meaning in everything -- and seeing that dramatized in Mr. Turkowski's retelling was enough, for me, to turn ""Margarete,"" though just a bunch of film clips, into theater. For what does theater need beyond a story and someone willing to let it unfold?

The result, in ""Re-Member Me,"" stylishly directed by Jan-Willem van den Bosch and performed in the Public's largest theater, is a bit blurry. For about half of its 60 minutes it seems to be a multimedia meditation on ""Hamlet"" and the British actors who have triumphed in the role. Mr. Beau lip-syncs to a collage of recordings of their performances, expertly shaping his mouth around the idiosyncratic cadences of John Gielgud, Ian McKellen and others. He does not, however, imitate them physically or create a kind of meta-""Hamlet"" from the snippets. Sometimes, as when he performs a vigorously aerobic rendition of ""Y.M.C.A."" or channels a bit of Barbra Streisand, it's hard to guess what he is doing at all. But in the second half, a narrative haltingly takes over. It now becomes evident that Mr. Beau is interested less in ""Hamlet"" itself than in the cultural space where ""Hamlet"" intersects gayness as gayness intersects loss. The story of Mr. Gielgud's conviction for homosexual ""importuning"" in 1953 -- a conviction that almost ruined him -- is recited. At the center of the play, though, is the Scottish actor Ian Charleson, best known in the United States as the star of ""Chariots of Fire"" but remembered in ""Re-Member Me"" for the ""Hamlet"" he performed at the National Theater in 1989, while dying of AIDS. The play is thus a eulogy, as Mr. Beau mouths, on video, reminiscences of that performance from Richard Eyre, who directed the production; John Wood, Mr. Charleson's agent; Sean Matthias, his close friend; and Mr. McKellen. These videos are shown on a screen above the stage while, live and somewhat distractingly, Mr. Beau putters below, endlessly arranging and dressing some disassembled mannequins. If we eventually come to understand that gesture as an act of reconstitution -- Mr. Beau ""re-members"" Mr. Charleson from the plastic body parts -- that does not make it especially coherent. Mr. Charleson and his ""Hamlet"" remain abstract. But as a theatrical parable, ""Re-Member Me"" is powerful nonetheless, positing acting as a means by which gay men of a very recent era sought to reintegrate themselves into a culture that otherwise viciously disowned them.","At the 14th Under the Radar festival, artists working with found audio and video stretch the boundaries of theater.",727f2fac-b1c7-5f44-b7c1-78abdfe55edf,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/10/arts/10undertheradar-notebook-1/10undertheradar-notebook-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=a7f7e75937a8ad5e7adcb4a0d5b07f0bcf17f516668df9ab0d1c4729e5462e9a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Dickie Beau in the eclectic &ldquo;Re-Member Me,&rdquo; which mixes drag, dance and Shakespeare.",727f2fac-b1c7-5f44-b7c1-78abdfe55edf,N24News/imgs/727f2fac-b1c7-5f44-b7c1-78abdfe55edf.jpg,10
Art & Design,"German Expressionism's 'Other' Painter, at Neue Galerie",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/08/arts/design/german-expressionisms-other-painter-at-neue-galerie.html,"In the same way that Bill Wyman doesn't leap to mind when you think of the Rolling Stones, or Zeppo when you think of the Marx Brothers, the painter Alexei Jawlensky (1864-1941) has never been -- at least for most Americans -- a household name in German Expressionism, the movement he helped create with his friend Wassily Kandinsky.

Jawlensky, born in Russia, had an up-and-down career and up-and-down relationships. But his best works hum with a power and intensity that, as the critic John Russell once wrote, ""bear down on us like runaway locomotives."" Beginning Thursday, Feb. 16, the Neue Galerie, New York's Expressionist jewel, will host the first full museum retrospective in the United States devoted to his work, with 75 paintings that he made from 1900 to 1937, including a selection of the semiabstract ""Mystical Head"" portraits that are among his most beloved.

Automobiles,The Panamera Family Show-Off,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/08/automobiles/autoreviews/the-porsche-panamera-family-show-off.html,"WHAT IS IT? Porsche's 190 m.p.h. interpretation of a four-door 911 Turbo. IS IT EXPENSIVE? Oh, yes. With a few options, the Turbo S is roughly the price of eight Volkswagen GTIs: $174,175 base and $194,665 as tested. Major options included ceramic composite brakes ($8,840), aqua blue metallic paint ($3,140) and illuminated carbon-fiber door sill guards ($1,850). WHAT'S UNDER THE HOOD? A 4.8-liter V-8 with twin turbochargers (550 horsepower, 553 pound-feet of torque; 590 pound-feet with overboost) with a 7-speed Porsche Doppelkupplung automated sequential manual transmission and all-wheel drive. IS IT THIRSTY? Yes, but it dodges the federal gas-guzzler tax with a rating of 15 m.p.g. in the city and 23 m.p.g. on the highway.

EVERY time Porsche rolls out a Turbo model -- a designation that can now be found in the 911, Cayenne and Panamera lines -- it's clear that Stuttgart is pulling its punches. That's because the latest Turbo is inevitably followed by the Turbo S, an even faster model that unmasks the Turbo as a sandbagging back-of-the-classroom slacker. Turbo, why can't you be more like your brother, Turbo S? In keeping with the tradition, the Panamera Turbo S is like a Panamera Turbo that's having a really good day. The S is a little bit brighter, a little bit sharper and a lot more expensive. Revised engine management and upgraded turbochargers bump the horsepower rating to 550, from 500, while the peak torque rises to 590 pound-feet from 568. Porsche actually quotes two torque figures, one of them the all-day-long-on-the-autobahn number, and the other the ""overboost"" torque that's available for temporary sprints and pulling stumps back on the farm. I referenced the higher number because it seems more likely that you'd indulge in temporary full-throttle situations than constant-load slogging. But if you manage to bolt your Panamera motor to the propeller of a medium-size Louisiana shrimp boat, be aware that constant maximum torque will be only 553 pound feet. In terms of outright capability, the Panamera Turbo S is on the extreme end of the sports car spectrum. Porsche claims 0-to-60 acceleration in 3.6 seconds, which puts the Panamera in roughly the league of the Chevrolet Corvette Z06 and the Audi R8. That's decent company, considering that the Panamera is a four-door car with 44.1 cubic feet of cargo space. (For comparison, that's within a couple of cubic feet of the cargo bed of a Cadillac Escalade EXT pickup truck.)

Because the Turbo S uses all-wheel drive and the PDK dual-clutch transmission, a scalding computer-managed launch demands little more than a prod of the right foot. Yet despite all the automated technologic wizardry under the skin, the Panamera makes an effort to involve the driver. For evidence, take a look at the center console, which is festooned with performance-related buttons. You can push a button for Sport mode, or, if you're feeling sportier than that, Sport Plus. There's a button to adjust the compliance of the suspension and another for its height. You can push a button to deactivate the stability-control system and push another to raise the rear spoiler. If you'd like the exhaust a bit louder, there's a button for that. There's a system that kills the engine when you're stopped -- the V-8 reawakens with the subtlety of a sleeping rhino prodded with a sharp stick -- but it can be deactivated. There's a button. As four-doors go, the performance of the Panamera Turbo S is essentially untouchable. But you do pay for that distinction, quite literally. For $200,000, would you rather have a well-optioned Panamera Turbo S or a trip into space on Virgin Galactic? Never mind; just sell four shares of your Berkshire Hathaway stock and say yes to both. Now that we've dealt with the matter of value, I'll turn to a couple of other quibbles. First, the Panamera's horn emits an uncharacteristically feeble beep-beep, sounding like the Road Runner with mono. Second, this car is conceited. Check out the self-referential keyfob, which is molded in the shape of the Panamera's silhouette. That's like carrying a photo of yourself in your wallet. The Audi A7's key doesn't resemble an A7, and that car's sculptured beauty makes the Panamera look like Charlize Theron -- Charlize Theron in ""Monster."" But looks are subjective. Performance is not. And the numbers say that the Panamera Turbo S is the quickest four-door in all the land. Sorry, Turbo.","The Porsche Panamera Turbo S is a little sharper, a lot more expensive and faster than the Turbo version.

Science,"People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/24/science/ufo-sightings-book.html,"People Are Seeing U.F.O.s Everywhere, and This Book Proves It

SYRACUSE -- Why have sightings of unidentified flying objects around the nation more than tripled since 2001? Why is July the busiest month for U.F.O. sightings? Why did they spike in Texas in 2008, or in New Mexico in September 2015? And how in the world, or out of it, has Manhattan racked up New York State's second-highest tally of U.F.O. sightings in this century? These questions and many others emerge from the first comprehensive statistical summary of so-called close encounters: 121,036 eyewitness accounts, organized county by county in each state and the District of Columbia, from 2001 to 2015. The unlikely compendium, ""U.F.O. Sightings Desk Reference,"" is the work of a couple in Syracuse, who crunched unruly data on U.F.O. reports collected by two volunteer organizations: the Mutual U.F.O. Network, or Mufon, and the National U.F.O. Reporting Center, or Nuforc.

It is the reference ""U.F.O. researchers dreamed of having,"" Gordon G. Spear, emeritus professor of physics and astronomy at Sonoma State University in California, writes in the foreword. The book contains no narrative or anecdotal accounts, just 371 pages of charts and graphs that slice and dice the geography and timing of the incidents and the various shapes that witnesses reported: flying circles, spheres, triangles, discs, ovals, cigars. Many of the sightings turn out to be explainable, the authors say, but a small percentage defy resolution. The authors are Cheryl Costa, 65, a former military technician and aerospace analyst, and her wife, Linda Miller Costa, 62, a librarian at Le Moyne College and a former librarian at the National Academy of Sciences, NASA and the Environmental Protection Agency.

Cheryl Costa was writing New York Skies, a U.F.O. blog for The Syracuse New Times, when the Costas decided to expand their tallies of U.F.O. sightings nationwide. ""We wanted to do our bit for disclosure,"" she said. ""It's something the government should have been doing."" The Costas realize some might find this a strange way to spend weekends. But both say they have spotted U.F.O.s themselves and want to detoxify the subject. ""We're doing scientific research,"" Cheryl Costa said. ""What's crazy is not being willing to look at research."" She came to the collaboration roundabout, having served as a cable lineman in the Air Force in Vietnam, and afterward in the Navy's submarine service, as a man before undergoing gender-reassignment surgery in the 1980s. Ordained as a Buddhist nun, she was running a theater group in Maryland when she met Linda. They wed in 2011. ""With this compendium, Cheryl and Linda Costa have reminded the public and the media the extraterrestrial phenomenon continues unabated,"" said Stephen Bassett, founder and executive director of the Paradigm Research Group, which lobbies for disclosure of official U.F.O. records. Rebutting a common perception that U.F.O. sightings are on the wane, the Costas' book shows that sightings have risen in waves, to 11,868 nationwide in 2015 from 3,479 in 2001. Only a small fraction of sightings are actually reported to Mufon or Nuforc.

Their labor of love is about the numbers, just the numbers, and the Costas refrain from speculating on what exactly is happening. ""We really don't know,"" Linda Costa said. ""But all these people are seeing these things."" The government officially quit the U.F.O. business in 1968, with the finding in the Condon report from the University of Colorado that there was nothing significant to investigate, although some 30 percent of the incidents were unexplained. Mufon's 500 volunteer investigators, however, continue to check out many of the sightings reported to the group. Roger Marsh, a Mufon spokesman, said that of the 270 cases his group investigated in Manhattan from 2002 through 2016, 44 eluded explanation and remained ""unknown."" One of the most intriguing occurred on the afternoon of Sept. 17, 2011, when a man on the roof terrace of the New Museum on the Bowery photographed a fast-moving diamond-shaped object with windows and flashing blue and red lights against the TriBeCa skyline.

According to Mufon, it resembled an unknown flying object photographed in Round Rock, Tex., two weeks earlier. The Costas listed 426 sightings in New York County from 2001 to 2015, second in the state's tallies only to Suffolk County, on the tip of Long Island, with 554. How so many sightings in the nation's densest core and around its toniest beach resorts have escaped wider notoriety is just part of the mystery.

For the U.F.O. enthusiast, the pages of graphs and charts are a treasure trove of hard-to-find detail. The District of Columbia, with 9,856 people per square mile, had the fewest sightings: 154. (A political snub from deep space?) Wyoming, with 5.8 people per square mile, had more than twice as many: 337. Fireballs made up nearly 8 percent of the sightings in Indiana (230) and fewer than 5 percent in Colorado (157). California, the most populous state, led the nation in U.F.O. reports (15,836, more than the next two states, Florida and Texas, combined). Los Angeles County alone had more sightings than 40 states, followed by Maricopa County, Ariz., which includes Phoenix. Population fails to explain the figures conclusively, the Costas said. Washington State, with 6.7 million people according to the 2010 census, ranks No. 4 in sightings, ahead of Pennsylvania, with 12.7 million people, and New York State, with 19 million. Rather, the Costas theorize, the figures may reflect good West Coast weather, which draws more people outside where they may spot U.F.O.s. Nationwide sightings peak in July, they found, and drop off between December and February. Still, in Mississippi, U.F.O. reports spike in January and November; in New Mexico, in September. The arduous breakdown by the nation's more than 3,000 counties was notable for revealing clusters of sightings in remote regions, places where U.F.O.s are almost never mentioned. But every county in the United States appears to have seen at least one U.F.O. In the end, the Costas noted, the spikes may have a lot to do with media coverage.","An unlikely new reference guide breaks down U.F.O. sightings county by county, shape by shape, month by month.",9fb5c440-8249-5b1c-a759-31c95b63a596,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/25/science/25sci-ufo-web/25sci-ufo-web-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=8d3e832052cb0618729e67cc7a8cbc0506c6bcf25f5feac9ac96994c135d33f6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A protest in Washington, D.C., in 1995 outside the offices of the General Accounting Office.",9fb5c440-8249-5b1c-a759-31c95b63a596,N24News/imgs/9fb5c440-8249-5b1c-a759-31c95b63a596.jpg,2
Opinion,What's Behind the Nursing Home Horror,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/opinion/nursing-home-coronavirus.html,"Another correspondent, who had worked in health care administration, said that she was ""not surprised in the least that the hospitals were trying to discharge their Covid-19 infected patients"" back to long-term-care facilities because, in her experience, this has ""been happening for quite some time."" It got worse: Agreeing with me about the radical understaffing of nursing homes, she said that it is ""increasingly common is to discharge high cost and difficult patients to homeless shelters ... Yep, you heard me right ... HOMELESS SHELTERS.""

Not every story was coronavirus-specific. One man told me the story of the fatal neglect of his father -- after which the nursing home falsified his father's records and hid behind state laws that nursing home lobbyists had written.

A former director of nursing at a long-term-care facility said that given her terrible professional experiences, she had refused to put her 78-year-old husband, who was suffering from dementia, anywhere outside her own home. Another clearly frightened woman explained that she had just had a horrible experience with her mother in a nursing home; she even gave me, a complete stranger, her phone number, in the desperate hope that I could raise the alarm about how bad things were.

We need to listen to people like this and act on what they are saying. The pandemic doesn't have many silver linings, but as the number of nursing-home deaths piles up, the news media is being forced to cover a world many of us would prefer to ignore.

It is understandable that we would. Part of the price we pay for living in a death-denying, consumerist, throwaway culture is that we must push these kinds of grim realities to unseen places that afford us plausible deniability. The pandemic forces us to look. If we want to understand the current phase of the coronavirus pandemic, we can no longer look away.

After receiving this waterfall of messages, I expected to fall into despair. But while I do have my bad days, I also have hope. Times like this have produced major cultural changes in our past. If we do take a hard look, we may change more than just the way we treat older Americans. We may, along the way, find a way to push against throwaway culture in all its forms.

Instead of denying the reality of cognitive impairment, aging and death, could our culture begin to embrace it forthrightly in ways which lead us to honor the final years we have with the family members and friends who go before us? To honor the moral and social equality of every human being, regardless of their mental or physical status?

Why not? Many of us are staying home and practicing physical distancing, not primarily for ourselves but for the benefit of our elders and others who find themselves at risk. Let us build on that good and decent impulse by challenging a throwaway culture that, right up until this very moment, has marginalized these populations and made the nursing-home crisis a tragic inevitability.

Theater,The Guy Behind 'Be More Chill' Is Keeping It in the Family,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/20/theater/joe-iconis-be-more-chill-broadway.html,"Joe Iconis at his annual Christmas show at Feinstein's/54 Below, which brings together his regular collaborators, many of whom, like him, have been waiting for their break in New York theater.

The Guy Behind 'Be More Chill' Is Keeping It in the Family

Joe Iconis exploded out of N.Y.U. on a wave of hope. A songwriter with a knack for story and a taste for strange, he won the Jonathan Larson grant for early career composers. He scooped up the Kleban prize for most promising lyricist. He was hailed by Newsday as ""ginormously talented."" The descriptors piled up until they made no sense any more. Emerging. Rising. Up-and-coming. But something wasn't clicking. Year after year he wrote song after song, show after show. Small-scale productions came and went; big-time producers did not. He sustained himself on determination. And side jobs. And borrowed money. But mostly, he sustained himself with an unusual artistic collective -- the Family, an evolving cohort of multitalented misfits (their word) -- that, for more than a decade, has plied basements and barns, singing Mr. Iconis's rock- and pop-influenced songs to a growing audience of fans. It is fandom that is finally propelling Mr. Iconis to Broadway. The sci-fi high school musical ""Be More Chill,"" for which he wrote music and lyrics, was left for dead in New Jersey after a tepid review from The New York Times. Resurrection has come thanks to young enthusiasts, who created YouTube videos using the show's music, shared fan art on Tumblr, and have streamed the cast album more than 200 million times.

He loved theater. But he hated performing. ""I was always terrible,"" he said. ""I knew I was terrible. And it terrified me."" So he took to the piano, writing songs, directing shows, doing anything that allowed him to make theater without being center stage. ""I both gravitate toward and identify with people who feel like they don't quite fit in,"" he said. In college and grad school, both at New York University, he zeroed in on writing, and for his thesis in 2005, he crafted a musical about a garage band, ""The Black Suits,"" that seemed to have promise. ""I thought, 'This show will be produced Off Broadway, it will be well received, it will go to Broadway, and this is how I will enter into the musical theater world,'"" he said. The universe had other ideas. And Mr. Iconis, a prolific writer, was impatient to get his songs heard. So in 2006 he staged a concert at Ars Nova, a small but prestigious theater that seeks to develop early-career artists. He thought of ""Things to Ruin,"" as he called it, as a theatrical version of a rock album that never existed. He was the de facto frontman, playing the piano and occasionally singing, and he found that he now relished that. But his shows were also a showcase for his friends.

By last Christmas, when Joe Iconis and Friends performed what are now their annual Christmas shows at Feinstein's/54 Below, directed by his longtime collaborator John Simpkins, there were 65 performers -- onstage, interspersed among the audience, even caroling in the bathrooms. ""We were a bunch of rambunctious punk kids that loved musical theater but maybe didn't quite fit into the quintessential musical theater mold,"" Mr. Tam said. ""But we found each other and we found Joe Iconis."" Many of his songs are clever and raw, like ""Everybody's at the Bar Without Me,"" a furious ballad about feeling left out, and ""The Goodbye Song,"" the raucous singalong which closes most shows, inspired by a dying father bidding farewell to his child, but also weaving in affectionate allusions to E.T.'s return home in the great 1982 Spielberg movie. In the early years, the concerts were mostly at the Laurie Beechman Theater, a basement space underneath a Times Square restaurant, and at Joe's Pub, part of the Public Theater. In recent years, the main performances have been over Labor Day weekend at Barrington Stage Company in the Berkshires, and in December with a series of Christmas-themed shows at 54 Below, but there have been lots of others -- even a private party attended by James Earl Jones. ""It feels like this crazy circus that has followed him and helped put the music out there and spread the word about what he does,"" said Lauren Marcus, who met Mr. Iconis when she was at N.Y.U., sang in one of his earliest concerts, and then married him at a ceremony followed by a jamboree.

Over the years, artists have come, and gone, and come again. ""The more I met people, the more it started to become this idea -- like I'm driving a bus, and I would tell people to hop on, and they could stay as long as they want to,"" Mr. Iconis said. ""The whole Family idea is loose enough to accommodate the lives of working artists -- it needed to allow people to come and go as their life allowed."" Some are on Broadway -- Eric William Morris, a longtime member of the Family who portrays an addled bartender in the Christmas shows, is now starring in a musical adaptation of ""King Kong"" -- but many, like Mr. Iconis, have long been waiting for a big break. ""We shared that feeling -- when is this going to happen, and should we just go be investment bankers?"" Mr. Williams said. ""What got him and all of us through these struggling times were these concerts that we did together."" There's been some blowback. ""I definitely have a reputation of being very loyal, and that's important to me -- I love creating art with artists I have a history and a relationship with,"" Mr. Iconis said. ""But there was this notion of me as a frat boy working with his college friends. People got so insane about this idea of me just working with my buds."" He is unapologetic about wanting to advance his collaborators, and not simply allow them to be replaced by ""someone who was on a TV show in 2003,"" which is how he often sees theater casting. ""Many people have performed my stuff brilliantly for years, and I feel like it's my responsibility to do whatever I can to help,"" he said.

George Salazar, an actor who was featured in a Broadway revival of ""Godspell"" when he met Mr. Iconis, started singing in his concerts, and is now starring in ""Be More Chill"" as the protagonist's best friend; his emotional rendition of the show's big number, ""Michael in the Bathroom,"" has made him an internet sensation. ""The Family is a group of misfits,"" Mr. Salazar said, ""but the things that make us strange and different are the very things Joe enjoys."" Mr. Iconis likes to write in public spaces -- coffee shops and bars -- away from the piano, focusing on lyric and drama, and letting that drive melody. He has been prolific, helping to create 10 full-length musicals, but has also been increasingly disappointed that none found commercial success, and at times has even wondered whether he should try to convert one of his side jobs, graphic design, into a full-time career. ""He's had a tough time getting shows on, because people don't know where to place his shows -- they have a childlike exuberance for adults,"" said Julianne Boyd, the artistic director of Barrington Stage. He is culturally omnivorous, and often turns to musicals or films to explain his own feelings. Asked about his frustration, he cites a scene in ""Boogie Nights"" when the porn star protagonist realizes he is not going to get where he wanted, and a moment in ""Synecdoche, New York"" when a character buys a house on fire, knowing it might kill her. But one doesn't have to look far to see how taxing his long journey has been: His breakout song, ""Broadway, Here I Come!,"" an oft-covered number featured on the NBC television series ""Smash,"" is, at its most literal, about someone hoping to get to Broadway who contemplates suicide.

Emboldened by ""Be More Chill,"" which is selling well in early previews, Ms. Tepper is planning this week to announce a commercial Off Broadway production of another Iconis show, ""Broadway Bounty Hunter,"" about an out-of-work actor who finds a job hunting criminals. It stars Annie Golden, who, although more than a generation older than Mr. Iconis and his college friends, is one of his most loyal collaborators. He has two more high-profile works in process: ""The Untitled Unauthorized Hunter S. Thompson Musical,"" commissioned by La Jolla Playhouse, with a Tony-winning director, Christopher Ashley, attached; and ""Punk Rock Girl,"" a jukebox musical featuring songs popularized by female musicians. ""The dream is that it's a show done by school groups, and that it would be impossible not to cast the strangest kids -- the kids who would normally do tech,"" Mr. Iconis said. ""That was my guiding principle -- to write roles for the weird kids."" As he watches ""Be More Chill"" through the preview process, he is obviously nervous, aware that critics still may not embrace his work.

Books,"Liane Moriarty's New Novel, Set at a Spa, Features Some Killer Treatments",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/21/books/review/liane-moriarty-nine-perfect-strangers.html,"The perfect foil for the formidable Masha, and the standout spa-goer, is Frances Welty. Frances is a middle-aged romance novelist who's feeling terrible about herself after her publisher rejected her new manuscript, a reviewer hated her latest book and an online con man broke her heart in a catfishing scam. Frances may be down on her luck, and herself, but her warm sense of humor makes her completely relatable. At the pool, trying to impress another spa-goer, ""she wanted to convey strength in all her future interactions with this man, and her soft white body ... didn't convey much except 52 years of good living and a weakness for chocolate Lindt balls."" Frances describes the mandatory smoothies as ""green sludge"" and even tries to smuggle chocolate into Tranquillum House, acknowledging: ""This was rock-bottom. She'd just licked a Kit Kat wrapper.""

The other characters are also fully realized, with compelling lives, relationships and motivations. They include a sports marketing consultant, a husband and wife who won the lottery and are trying to salvage their marriage, a health-spa junkie (""I indulge and atone, indulge and atone""), a once-famous athlete and a recently divorced mother of four. An especially poignant story line follows another married couple, Heather and Napoleon, and their 20-year-old daughter, Zoe, who are all grieving the suicide of Zoe's twin brother, Zach. A subplot like that can veer into melodrama, but Moriarty handles it deftly. For example, when Zoe is asked about her upcoming birthday, she answers simply: ""I don't celebrate on that day anymore. I kind of changed my birthday.""

To divulge what happens next would spoil a major plot twist, though readers are given a tiny hint early on when Masha asks Frances how she likes the book she is reading. ""Frances thought about this. The book was meant to be another murder mystery, but the author had introduced far too many characters too early, and so far everyone was still alive and kicking. The pace had slowed. Come on now. Hurry up and kill someone.""

Economy,"Inside an Amazon Warehouse, Robots' Ways Rub Off on Humans",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/03/business/economy/amazon-warehouse-labor-robots.html,"Every day, about 50 truckloads of merchandise arrive at Amazon's Staten Island warehouse. While the center is highly automated, some tasks are likely to remain in human hands for years to come.

The last person to touch an item at an Amazon fulfillment center is the packer, whose job is to stick each order in a box and tape it shut. As with most jobs, being a packer is more complicated than it looks. Michael Waterman, a packer at Amazon's Staten Island warehouse, told me that when he started, he would grab each piece of tape too quickly, and it would invariably stick to his gloves. He ruined two pairs in his first two days. Later, he overcompensated by waiting too long, at which point the tape had lost its stickiness. Only after some experimentation did he find the sweet spot.

My trip to Amazon's Staten Island center had its origins two months earlier. I was writing about a former worker named Justin Rashad Long, who contended that he had been fired for speaking out about working conditions there. Beyond the claim of retaliation, Mr. Long said laboring at Amazon had been a tremendous slog: Employees worked long shifts with few breaks. Managers held them to unreasonable goals. The time they spent waiting in line at metal detectors -- to discourage theft -- lengthened their day. The company disputed these allegations, in some cases with extensive data. It invited me to come see the place for myself. (Amazon gives public tours at certain fulfillment centers, but not on Staten Island.) So, in mid-May, I spent a few hours observing workers and asking them about their jobs, with a press chaperone in tow. By the end, I had concluded that both sides had a point. The workplace, with more than 2,500 full-time employees, seemed more humane than the picture Mr. Long painted. The general manager, Chris Colvin, knew many of his employees' names and bantered with them amiably. The workers, in turn, seemed invested in the company. The center had recently held a contest for their children to illustrate job safety practices, like bending at the knees and wearing gloves. A few dozen drawings were still on the wall. But underlying Mr. Long's charge was the idea that Amazon treats workers as if they were something less than people -- that its obsession with optimizing fulfillment centers for a world of one-day delivery requires a system of stifling routines, rules and metrics. That system can make workers feel patronized and spied on. It can crowd out personal initiative.

There seemed to be something to the picture Mr. Long painted, though the problem may be less with Amazon than with technology itself. Software Looks Over Your Shoulder Every day, about 50 truckloads of merchandise turn up at the warehouse's receiving dock. One group of workers unloads the goods, and another group -- known as ""water spiders"" -- distributes them to work stations. There, a third group, known as stowers, transfers the items onto what are called pods. These are large shelving units that hold several dozen bins, which are attached to robots that move through the building. Of the entry-level jobs at Amazon, the stower's arguably provides the most room for decision making. Stowers choose the bin where they want to place each item, keeping in mind that they should make the task as easy as possible for the worker, known as a picker, who will have to grab items out of the bin. Stowers should, for example, avoid obscuring one item with another. ""Our customers are the pickers,"" a stower named Jing Zhang told me.

Mr. Zhang seemed like a state-of-the-art Amazon employee -- someone who saw the world through the eyes of a manager. ""I try to find ways to make me more efficient,"" he said. He figured out how to reduce wasted movement by unpacking the box closest to the shelving unit first, then replacing it with the next-closest box, rather than wandering to and from other boxes. Still, even Mr. Zhang and his fellow stowers must work with Amazon's software looking over their shoulder. If a stower attempts to stick, say, a bottle of sunscreen in a bin next to one that already has such a bottle of sunscreen in it, the bin will light up to signal that this is not allowed. Adjacent bins with identical items can confuse the pickers. The same thing happens if a stower tries to put heavy items too high on the pod, or too much weight on either side. After the pods are full, the robots move them across a large caged area. If an item falls down along the way, or a robot stalls, a worker on what's known as the amnesty team will venture into the cage to sort it out. The worker wears a special vest that allows the robot to detect his or her location and stop before it gets too close.

Watching an amnesty worker walk among the robots can feel a bit like watching a zookeeper mingle with lions. You know this is a trained professional who will probably walk in and out of the cage without incident. Yet you can't help wondering: What are the chances that this person gets mauled? Picking inventory off shelves to fill customer orders is usually the most common job at an Amazon warehouse, and the company has worked for years to make its pickers more productive.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. At many warehouses, pickers walk miles each day in search of items, but algorithms provide them with the optimal route. In the so-called robotics fulfillment centers like the one on Staten Island, the pickers are stationary and the robots deliver items to them. The company says these warehouses account for ""more than 50"" of its roughly 175 centers worldwide.

The robots have raised the average picker's productivity from around 100 items per hour to what Mr. Long and others have said is a target of around 300 or 400, though the numbers vary across teams and facilities. The robots help explain why Amazon managed to ship more items than ever during last year's holiday season with about 20 percent fewer seasonal workers than the year before. (Amazon said another reason was that it was focused more on permanent hiring in 2018.) Robots have also made the job far more repetitive. Unlike pickers in manual warehouses, the pickers on Staten Island have almost no relief from plucking goods off shelves, other than their breaks. A picker named Shawn Chase said he motivated himself by competing with a friend in a different part of the warehouse to see who could earn the higher productivity ranking. ""Last week I was 41st in the building,"" he said. ""This week I'm trying to be top 10."" The company has taken this logic even further in a handful of warehouses, The Washington Post has reported, creating video-game interfaces that allow workers to accumulate points and badges for completing these tasks. Amazon has periodically fueled rumors that it plans to fully automate picking in the near future, even sponsoring a contest for engineers who develop robotic picking arms. But the truth is that human pickers will be around for years. According to Russ Meller, who runs a group that designs warehouses at the engineering consulting firm Fortna, it would be hard for a robotic picking arm to navigate the shelving units that carry goods around Amazon's warehouse. The shelves are too large a target, and the bins may be too cramped or too deep. ""They really complicated it for the robot,"" said Mr. Meller, whose firm has not designed warehouses for Amazon. In effect, Amazon calculated that there was so much productivity to be gained from reducing the millions of miles its workers walk each year that it was better off finding robots well suited to moving goods all those miles, not worrying whether the system would later be compatible with robotic pickers. The difficulty of automating pickers puts pressure on the humans to become more productive. ""We try to eliminate any wasted movement,"" LeVar Kellogg, a picker who trains other pickers at an Amazon facility near Chicago, told me. ""If you have one second that's adding to the process, it doesn't seem like a lot. But if you do that 1,000 times a day, that's when it starts adding up.""

Sometimes these are strictly physical movements whose elimination almost no one would mourn. In other cases, the steps being removed involve thinking, too. Pickers at robotics facilities consult a monitor displaying a picture of the next screwdriver or watch or bottle of vitamins they're supposed to grab, as well as its location on the shelving unit's grid of bins. Some pickers have developed techniques for remembering this location, like yelling it out loud -- 3F! 4H! -- so they don't have to glance back at the monitor multiple times. But at the Amazon center on Staten Island, there is no need to remember the bin location. The bin holding the needed screwdriver or watch or bottle of vitamins simply lights up, turning the exercise into a gentle game of Whac-A-Mole. This steady stripping of human judgment from work is one of the most widespread consequences of automation -- not so much replacing people with robots as making them resemble robots. ""The next pod comes, and a pod comes after that, and after that,"" Mr. Long told me. ""All day till you get off.""","A machine-dominated workplace can make employees more mechanical themselves.

Travel,"In Hawaii, a Swimmer's Communion With the Wild Ocean",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/travel/hawaii-swimming-ocean-water.html,"Years ago, a close friend and I cemented a friendship that began in college by splashing our way around Hawaii, on his home island, Oahu. We visited other islands, too, like Kauai, where we waded into the Pacific at Polihale Beach, a remote 17-mile stretch of white sand at the end of the long, rutted dirt road that seems as far away as you can get from anywhere. We swam in that heaving body of aquamarine, and what I remember most is the profound feeling that the ocean water had weight -- that the powerful, muscular waves that lifted me could reverse their force at any time, pounding me into mush on the sand or sucking me far out to the horizon. It was humbling, and not a little frightening. But we were mesmerized by the pulse of the ocean, alive to the sound of the surf and the scent of the briny air. Daring to risk was part of the thrill of swimming out there. I have come to appreciate open water (an ocean, a big lake) as a challenge, a mode of transport. There is an energy to the ocean in particular, an element of danger that requires a giving over of self, that makes swimming in heavy water a kind of holy communion. I see swimming as a way to get to know a place with an intimacy that I otherwise wouldn't have. To swim in the ocean is to immerse myself in wildness, to feel the way the water rises and falls like breath.

Six years ago, I floated in the cerulean water at Tunnels Beach, on the north shore of Kauai, while pregnant with my older son, Felix, my sun-warmed belly poking above the waves as I took in the rippling red-and-green cliffs of the Na Pali Coast. Now I wanted Felix to feel that for himself, outside of me, fully aware of the cool water pulsing on his lanky 5-year-old body. Several months ago, my husband, Matt, and I began our sabbatical summer in Kauai, in the little north shore town of Haena. Over three weeks there, we fell into a languorous but satisfying routine. Every morning we would head over from our rental house to Tunnels Beach, named for the distinctive underwater lava tubes -- those long, cavelike tunnels and coral formations so beloved and frequented by divers who swim around and through them. It has a crescent-shape bay with coral reefs and a broad expanse of calm, waist-deep water ideal for snorkeling and swimming. We would go early and leave by noon, when the sun began to exert maximum scorch and the crowds grew thick. Felix was frightened of the sea at first, but little by little he got comfortable in the gently rolling surf. What came, in quick succession, was curiosity and tentative exploration. He bobbed; he practiced his freestyle and his backstroke. He looked for brilliant pink-and-blue parrotfish. There was giddiness at swimming out to the reef; spontaneous underwater somersaults; leaps, with abandon, to bodysurf to the sand alongside the locals. He loved the feeling that the water here was in some way alive, and different from the stillness of a pool. One day he befriended a 50-something bodysurfer named Dave, who shouted encouragement and expertly propelled himself toward shore with elan and grace. That evening, my son drew a picture of himself bodysurfing in the waves with his ""new friend"" Dave.

The pleasures of swimming in a place can be everyday, routine, familiar. In 1779, a lieutenant of Capt. James Cook admired the native Hawaiians' swimming abilities with an entry in his ship's log: ""The Women could swim off to the Ship, & continue half a day in the Water;"" in Hawaiian, Polynesian and other enduring island cultures of the Pacific, men, women and children were all observed as being ""almost amphibious"" from birth. This is as lovely and pure an image of the freewheeling freedom of swimmers as any I have come across. The tradition of the Hawaiian waterman is alive today, as residents grow up frolicking in the waves -- surfing, swimming and paddling as a matter of course, learning the rules of the ocean. Local swim clubs lead guided ocean swims on the weekends to all comers, swims that are a mile and a half along the beach or to an offshore island. That kind of open-water education is the essence of a childhood in Hawaii. This idea takes hold every time I visit. Every morning at Tunnels I swam a mile or more, zigzagging between reefs and following the locals to what they could show me. Once I tailed two spear fishermen, clad in their dusky-green camouflage wet suits, and spotted four large sea turtles resting 15 feet below at the bottom of the ocean, feasted on by tiny fish known as cleaner wrasse; in a marvel of symbiosis, the wrasse detailed their hard shells by Hoovering up parasites and dead skin. An efficient 45 minutes later, the young fishermen emerged from the sea with the day's catch in hand: huge mahi-mahi, two each. On other days I swam alongside ropy-armed surfers as far as I could before they paddled beyond the outer reef, where the wind whipped whitecaps across the sea. I treaded water and watched safely from within the reef as they made elegant, sinuous turns across the face of each wave as it broke. We became friendly with a young family who lived nearby and whom we saw often during those mornings. The toddler daughter liked to investigate our snacks and toys, and play with our 3-year-old son, Teddy. The father, nut-brown from the sun, sat in the shallows collecting tiny, intricately patterned shells the size of sesame seeds that he said were once collected only by the holiest of Hawaiian priests. One morning as I was swimming in the coral-punctuated shallows, two men called my attention to a four-foot shark resting on its side in the waist-deep water. It was a juvenile, they said, and it had probably died while trying to find its way back to deeper water through the maze of vividly colored near-shore corals, some boulder-size, others cactuslike and still others resembling giant brains with lobes. Later, a lifeguard in sunglasses and red swim trunks roared up in a dune buggy and dragged the shark onto the beach. Bystanders came around to stare at its smooth gray hide, bloodied nose and clouded-over eyes. The episode didn't stop any of us from swimming. But it was a sobering reminder, welcome or not, of the ocean's ever-present dangers: sharks, riptides, razor-sharp reefs.

These are risks that we swimmers are willing to take for the egalitarian joys that come from swimming in this ocean. Back in Honolulu, one of my favorite swimming spots is Ala Moana Beach along the downtown waterfront. In the middle of the city, steps from high-rise towers, the smooth, reef-protected ocean at Ala Moana serves as the de facto communal pool. Everybody, and every body, is welcome. To swim there with the locals is to experience the place at fish-eye level: Turn your head makai or toward the ocean, to breathe, and there are surfers paddling out to the break; turn your head mauka or toward the mountains, and there are Japanese brides and grooms in white-columned gowns and trim dark suits having pictures taken on their wedding day. From this perspective, everything feels strangely possible: It is a swim through a flipbook of improbable vacation photos all stitched together.","""We swam in that heaving body of aquamarine, and what I remember most is the profound feeling that the ocean water had weight.""",691c3f37-fa0b-505e-b089-b6ab353ee744,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/05/travel/05HAWAII/05HAWAII-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=db36b7fffc9a94c3f811ee7c2f6b06f1f71ffcd6d71c1eee599e621b14642baa&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,A swimmer at sunset at Ala Moana Beach in Honolulu.,691c3f37-fa0b-505e-b089-b6ab353ee744,N24News/imgs/691c3f37-fa0b-505e-b089-b6ab353ee744.jpg,4
Movies,Review: A Tragic Wig and the Search for Happiness in 'Oh Lucy!',https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/28/movies/oh-lucy-review.html,"It's a small land mine of a scene -- it would be easy to turn against Setsuko right then -- but Ms. Hirayanagi proves distinctly adept at shifting tones. She's also a fast worker, and she quickly navigates through the story's trickier, more emotionally precarious moments without seeming to rush through or away from them. The woman's weeping may be sad, at least given the circumstances, office decorum and social norms. But her galumphing howls also sound funny, too loud, faintly ridiculous, performative and self-flattering. Setsuko may be mean, but in a movie that is very much concerned with identity and the roles that we assume and reject, it's clear that she isn't entirely unjustified.

At first, Ms. Terajima's subtle performance works like a roadblock to easy sympathy. With her defeated shoulders and practiced deadpan, Setsuko seems to be a passive observer, someone who has become good at watching other people live. She isn't at all likable and it isn't clear, at least initially, if she's even worthy of sustained interest. When she hunkers down smoking in her tiny, uncomfortably cluttered apartment -- a killing field of empty cans, miscellaneous junk and aspirational fashion goods -- it looks as if she's living in the aftermath of a disaster of her own making. A lot of actors can weep on cue, but it takes one as good as Ms. Terajima to make emptiness feel haunted.

Together with her director, Ms. Terajima fills up that emptiness with deep, then deeper waves of feeling, and escalating, freewheeling comedy. After some narrative busywork, John disappears and Setsuko -- weighted down with a large suitcase and her comically, aggressively angry sister (Kaho Minami) -- follows him to Southern California. There, amid the sunshine and enveloping shadows, Setsuko finds and then loses herself while cutting loose and engaging in some savage psychological blood sport. She stumbles and she falls, plays at being Lucy and slips back into a radically changed Setsuko in a movie in which the human comedy is by turns tender, plaintive, heartfelt and joyful.",The writer-director Atsuko Hirayanagi traces the ordinary absurdities of one woman's life in this against-the-odds charmer.,bc50d2a9-d17e-50ad-8f4d-9490ec665992,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/02/arts/02ohlucy/02ohlucy-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d170867e8aa3106cb54e81184e31bcb53374e8ee40560a1e2ac5a26a311b2253&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Shinobu Terajima in Atsuko Hirayanagi&rsquo;s &ldquo;Oh Lucy!,&rdquo; an against-the-odds charmer.",bc50d2a9-d17e-50ad-8f4d-9490ec665992,N24News/imgs/bc50d2a9-d17e-50ad-8f4d-9490ec665992.jpg,5
Fashion & Style,"British Fashion After Brexit, and Without Meghan",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/14/fashion/megxit-brexit-london-fashion-week.html,"LONDON -- Two years ago, on a wintry February night, the clinking of champagne flutes clutched by editors, buyers and influencers in town for London Fashion Week could be heard echoing through the gilded state rooms of Buckingham Palace. The starry function, attended by Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, was one of several celebrations in recent years where fashion industry insiders have been hosted in the innermost sanctum of the British establishment. The famous glossy black front door of 10 Downing Street had repeatedly opened for fashion receptions held by Samantha Cameron, the wife of the former prime minister David Cameron, and Theresa May, Mr. Cameron's successor.

But then Meghan and Harry decamped to North America. Fed up with England's tabloids and stiff sensibilities, they will no longer be working royals and are instead on the road to ""financial independence,"" presumably by eventually leveraging their brand, Sussex Royal. And newly ensconced at No. 10 is Carrie Symonds, Boris Johnson's partner, who appears to hold little interest in embracing the high-fashion crowd. Instead, the 31-year-old is using her platform to champion conservationism. (Her Twitter bio specifies ""oceans"" and ""fighting plastic pollution."") Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, was the guest editor of the September 2019 issue of British Vogue. Now, as the latest round of runway shows begin, and two weeks after Britain formally began its exit from the European Union, London Fashion Week faces a front row devoid of an internationally recognized patron.

Such a vacuum could not come at a worse time: The national industry is sorely in need of a champion who could boost its appeal on the global stage, and local designers are feeling increasingly insecure. Then again, in the time of Instagram, how important are celebrities to the industry's international image?

""Very,"" said Rosie Nixon, the editor in chief of Hello! magazine, one of England's most widely read celebrity weeklies. ""For our readers, first ladies hold a little less appeal, but Kate and Meghan are in a total class of their own. Readers appreciate all their fashion moments and that both Duchesses mix high street with high fashion. They'll happily spend serious money trying to copy exactly what they wear, too, whether from British brands or other parts of the world."" According to Lyst, the global fashion search platform, the influence the Duchesses have when it comes to fashion brands of all sizes can be quantified by the spikes they generate in online traffic. After Meghan wore a pair of Jimmy Choo Romy pump shoes to Canada House for an engagement last month, for example, searches increased by 126 percent in 26 hours. Wearing a black Marks & Spencer jumper increased searches for the brand by 387 percent in 12 hours, while a Club Monaco shirt dress worn by the Duchess last September during the royal couple's tour of South Africa sold out in less than 24 hours -- following a 570 percent spike in searches.

Ms. Symonds can also prompt her own occasional online shopping bonanza, sparking a 140 percent surge in searches for ""Whistles animal print dresses"" after she wore a version at the Conservative party conference last fall, and a 233 percent spike in those hunting for the Luella dress by British brand Ghost after it was worn by Ms. Symonds for her first official appearance at Downing Street. So who might step up and fill the void? Social media influencers may be paid tens of thousands of pounds to turn up at fashion week events and appear in campaigns or even on the runway. But Rosie Shephard, the founder of the Luxury Communications Council, said that only a handful of those people are able to move meaningful volumes of clothes, shoes and handbags. ""Instagram is now flooded with photos of either influencers or celebrities in contractual relationships with brands, and savvy consumers recognize this in an instant. The magic has slightly worn off that approach,"" Ms. Shephard said. ""What makes most royals and politicians unique is the restrictions on them making money from their fashion choices. So what they wear, even if chosen for them by stylists, feels more authentic for many fans. And for a brand, it makes that endorsement invaluable."" Whether that will still hold true for the Duchess of Sussex now that she has changed her rules of engagement is unclear. Her relocation could mean paid ambassadorial agreements with fashion brands -- or even her own collection -- further down the line. (Any official details are yet to be disclosed.) Up until now, she has supported a number of British designers, albeit to a lesser extent than her sister-in-law. Whether she feels obligated to continue that patronage, or expands it to include even more designers from Canada and the rest of the Commonwealth, remains to be seen. As for other potential royal fashion supporters, Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie appear to have been encouraged to pursue office jobs, while Sophie Wessex, a one-time public relations maven, is dutiful but not especially starry. The Duchess of Cambridge, adept at a public charm offensive, is a quiet booster. Still, a transition to front-row mainstay seems at odds with her ongoing efforts to appear normal.","This season, London Fashion Week faces a front row without a glossy, global British patron.

Low, whose son Seth Low was mayor of Brooklyn in the 1880s and mayor of New York in 1902-03. The building has been subdivided into eight apartments, to be delivered vacant.

This penthouse with 11,000 square feet is on the 10th, 11th and 12th floors of One Brooklyn Bridge Park, a waterfront condominium in Brooklyn Heights. It has six bedrooms, six full bathrooms, two half baths, a terrace, a 3,500-bottle wine room, a gym with a climbing wall, a screening room and views of the Statue of Liberty and New York Harbor.

This triplex penthouse in the Clock Tower condominium at 1 Main Street in Dumbo has three bedrooms, three and a half baths, a glass elevator and four giant see-through working glass clocks with views of the Brooklyn Bridge and New York Harbor. Originally listed for $25 million in 2009, the penthouse has gone through a series of price cuts and a parade of brokers.

This gated five-bedroom property in Mill Basin at 2458 National Drive is on Jamaica Bay. It includes a pool, an outdoor pavilion that seats 40 and two boat slips. Originally listed for $30 million in October 2013 with a guesthouse, the price was cut to $17 million about six months ago and no longer includes the guesthouse.

This 25-foot-wide five-story 1859 brownstone in Brooklyn Heights at 192 Columbia Heights has six bedrooms, three full baths, two half baths, three fireplaces, a library, two terraces and a landscaped backyard. Norman Mailer once used studio space on the top floor. The house was originally listed for $16 million in April of last year.","To get to Brooklyn, win the lottery first.",8fa08d84-fbee-52dd-a9b1-37a811a5bdee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/05/10/realestate/10COVSIDE3/10COVSIDE3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=c7ae1fbd9df14624fcf47517b88197bcbf99a8b1850ab5ea14c9e0895229a73d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"3 Pierrepont Place, Brooklyn Heights",8fa08d84-fbee-52dd-a9b1-37a811a5bdee,N24News/imgs/8fa08d84-fbee-52dd-a9b1-37a811a5bdee.jpg,7
Television,Stream These Spooky Haunted House Movies,https://www.nytimes.com/article/haunted-house-movies.html,"It took over 30 years for Nobuhiko Obayashi's completely bananas experimental horror film to get a proper release in America, but it took little time for cult audiences to rally around it. The plot, such as it goes, involves a teenage girl who decides to visit her aunt with some friends on summer vacation, only to discover her aunt is dead and her country home is a surrealist death trap. Mostly, the setting allows Obayashi to uncork deliriously strange images -- household objects coming to life, a malevolent white cat that shoots bloody projectiles, bodies disassembling and reassembling -- and fiddle with in-camera effects and a manic editing scheme. It's an exhilarating chaos.

Shrewdly engineered to give studio horror the scale of a summer blockbuster, ""The Conjuring"" combined the haunted house mythos of ""The Amityville Horror"" with the stylistic bravado of ""The Exorcist"" to become a commercial juggernaut. It even has the based-on-a-true-story authenticity of drawing from the misadventures of Ed and Lorraine Warren, two real-life paranormal investigators. Decked out in the fashionable browns of the early '70s, Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga star as the Warrens, who are summoned to rural Rhode Island to look into demonic happenings at a family farmhouse. They begin to suspect, however, that it's the family, not the farmhouse, that's really haunted. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

Fresh from a stay in a mental institution, Jessica (Zohra Lampert) seeks refuge at an old Connecticut farmhouse, which happens to be the site where a woman drowned on her wedding day in 1880. As she, her husband, their friend, and a mysterious drifter settle into the place, the bizarre events that follow -- and the sinister whispers and tension between the conspiratorial townspeople (all wearing bandages) and these hippie interlocutors -- loosen Jessica's tenuous grip on her sanity.

""The Belasco House"" was named after an unspeakably perverse, six-foot-five millionaire who indulged in every vice imaginable, running the gamut from alcoholism and heroin addiction to incest, necrophilia, bestiality and cannibalism. ""Bad vibes"" don't begin to describe the psychic energy on the premises, but four intrepid paranormal investigators poke around anyway, including a half-dazed Roddy McDowall as a man who visited the house before and barely lived to return. The libertine sexuality of early '70s cinema gives ""The Legend of Hell House"" a sensual charge, but it's equally blessed by the dry British humor that undercuts the horror. Rent it on Amazon, Google Play and YouTube.

In J.A. Bayona's gothic Spanish frightfest, a woman and her husband buy the creepy seaside orphanage where she was raised with the intention of turning it into a home for sick children. What follows is a barrage of horror tropes: Children as ghouls in burlap masks, references to fairy tales like ""Hansel & Gretel,"" Super 8 home movies, the seance of ""Poltergeist."" Rooted in the scares is the vulnerability of the young -- and Bayona's uncanny ability to make his adult audience feel it, too. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube. Though adults may find plenty to like about ""Monster House,"" an animated horror-comedy with the look of a Halloween pop-up book, parents should proceed with caution when introducing it to their kids, especially if they're under school age. But as a colorful primer for the genre, the film is witty and fast-paced, built around the clever premise of a house that's a fully integrated evil entity, not merely a space for ghosts to roam. Three teenagers attribute the tricycle-destroying property across the street to the mean old man who owns it, but after he's carted away by an ambulance, they have to confront a house with plans to gobble up trick-or-treaters on Halloween night. Stream it on Peacock. Rent it on Amazon, Apple TV, Google Play, Vudu and YouTube.

Indie director Ti West turned to the haunted house movie with this throwback about an old New England inn on its last night before shutting down. The wage-slave banter between Sara Paxton and Pat Healy as the stewards of this nearly empty hotel recalls ""Clerks,"" but West dredges up a dark history that expresses itself one final time before the sun comes up. As he does with his retro-'80s horror movie, ""The House of the Devil,"" West delivers a slow-as-molasses film that builds dread deliberately until its explodes in the final act.

'I Am the Pretty Thing That Lives in the House' (2016) Osgood Perkins's concise chiller marinates in the New England gothic of a creaky old house that its heroine is duty-bound to occupy. After her brilliant run as a Hannibal Lecter-like evil genius on ""Luther,"" Ruth Wilson downshifts into the role of a brittle hospice nurse assigned to care for a retired horror author (Paula Prentiss) until she dies. She comes to discover that the author's fictional creations have a presence in the real world, too, and that she and her helpless, mysterious patient are like tenants in a house that doesn't really belong to them.",'Tis the season for movies that make you scared to turn off the lights.

Dance,Review: 'The Sleeping Beauty' Spurs American Ballet Theater to Work on the Details,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/16/arts/dance/review-the-sleeping-beauty-spurs-american-ballet-theater-to-work-on-the-details.html,"As American Ballet Theater gave a series of performances of its new production of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" last week, it was easy to spot ways in which things could sound and look better. Tchaikovsky's score should have been better played (especially by the brass and wind sections) and been more sensitively conducted, and Richard Hudson's sets (inspired by Bakst) deserved to be lighted considerably better than they have been by James B. Ingalls. And the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky, who is in charge of the whole production, has paid least attention to the most theatrically difficult part of this demanding ballet: the prince's arrival at the sleeping palace and the awakening of the heroine Aurora, her parents and their court. It's the only part of his production when everything lapses into ballet cliche, with none of the telling details that turn the rest of this work into absorbingly poetic drama. Let's hope Mr. Ratmansky, Mr. Hudson, Mr. Ingalls and Ballet Theater's music team regard this as a work in progress. There is already much for us to love, much for the company to take pride in and many details that help Tchaikovsky's superlative score become more absorbing than ever before. Ballet Theater, which doesn't always look like a united company, proves one in breadth and depth here -- not least because it is musically attentive. And we're reminded that no ballet better showcases the way in which a company operates and the style for which it aims. This production has been advantageous for almost every dancer in the company. It remains hard to believe how attentive Mr. Ratmansky has made everyone -- not least the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House -- to small details of footwork and gesture, by a combination of musical delicacy, unmannered physicality and lively humanity. The Met is an overly vast hangar, but Mr. Ratmansky is creating a style that makes it feel like an intimate chamber. Yes, Ballet Theater -- long an exponent of big, bashing, weary, repertory war horses -- is becoming a company of real charm. Who'd have thunk it?

Several corps dancers do three or four roles in an evening, and some of those parts are big advances in their careers. Gabe Stone Shayer (his large, beaming face lights up the Met), usually a cavalier in the Prologue and a Garland dancer in Act I, has been an impressive Bluebird, buoyant and sweet, in Act III. Cassandra Trenary, who also dances in ensembles in the Prologue and Act I, has shown sparkling delicacy in Act III as both the Diamond Fairy and Princess Florine. Other dancers bringing distinction to solo roles have included Skylar Brandt, April Giangeruso, Arron Scott and Paulina Waski, usually in the same performances as they dance in the corps. At principal level, Isabella Boylston, who at some performances makes a brilliant impression in the supporting roles of the Diamond Fairy and Princess Florine, is in dance terms the most dazzling interpreter of the central role of Princess Aurora; no ballerina in the company brings such elan to individual steps or such eagerness to that role. Diana Vishneva, though more experienced, brings more bloom to this heroine; her personal luster is extraordinary. Hee Seo, monochrome in some other ballets, fills the role with marvelous light and shade. Veronika Part, a Lilac Fairy of long experience, now radiates the mature generosity that this part is all about; on Thursday evening, her performance was the most wonderful thing in the whole ballet. Marcelo Gomes, who as Prince Desire delivers the taxing intricacies of his solo variation at the peak of an exemplary account of the role, also performs as the evil fairy, Carabosse, with splendidly venomous force. Cory Stearns, whose nobility has become nuanced by humor, reflectiveness and poignancy, takes the character of Desire through a true journey. At soloist level, Joseph Gorak, who often dances among the Fairy Cavaliers beside Mr. Shayer and Mr. Scott, is another Bluebird and prince of note. Although his acting can acquire more weight and his partnering more ease, he is now the company's foremost male coloratura dancer. Sarah Lane, the most royal of the company's Auroras in bearing, is also the most diffident; yet the phrasing she brought to the beginning of the Act I violin variation was of unmatched musical firmness and radiance. Stella Abrera, Christine Shevchenko and Roman Zhurbin are others who have grown notably in artistry. What characterizes the style of Ballet Theater's ""Beauty""? Acting and dance instincts overlap as dancers draw color from the score; dance line becomes a matter of newly subtle variety; and we see how Marius Petipa, the ballet's 1890 choreographer, welcomed multiplicity and simultaneity of stage action. Early in the Prologue, the King is downstage chatting to some courtiers about what a good looker his baby daughter, Aurora, will grow up to be. Meanwhile the Queen is upstage conversing with court ladies around the cradle, and the M.C., Catalabutte, is soliloquizing himself up into a lather of fretful anticipation -- all at the same time, all in mime gestures, and all endearingly human.

The dancing is equally layered. When the six fairy godmothers arrive, there are passages in which they, their eight attendants and four of their cavaliers are all dancing at once, like three orchestral groups in harmony. (Two of the cavaliers don't dance, so we also see how Petipa the classicist played number games with these choreographic groups of eight, six, four and two.) In Act I, when Princess Aurora's maids of honor are dancing center stage, the eight violin pages, on the sides of the stage, are doing gargouillades -- twinkling sideways jumps in which each foot writes a circle in the air. Still, there are lots of details that the company has yet to get right. Once Aurora drops the spindle after pricking her finger, why does nobody pick up it up? (Ms. Lane actually tripped over it.) Although Tatiana Ratmansky, who played the Queen and is the choreographer's wife and production colleague, had a great moment on June 8 when the realization that her daughter was dead hit her like a visible body blow, no interpreter has made that mother's anguish ring consistently true. All the dancers should be taught how to smile with their eyes more than with their mouths. But Ballet Theater, at last, has found itself a ""Sleeping Beauty"" in which the whole world onstage is engaging, lovely, touching.","A series of performances of a new production of ""The Sleeping Beauty"" offered a reminder that no ballet better showcases the way in which a company operates.",54a45255-e9ff-59ff-9ef3-323f5ddabde6,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/06/16/arts/16BEAUTY/16BEAUTY-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=550&w=1050&s=32e630a9a04868c668391a0a17e4142ec36d2ed7de00ebe45aeab9dd3a229673&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Sleeping Beauty  Diana Vishneva of American Ballet Theater in a new production of this ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House.,54a45255-e9ff-59ff-9ef3-323f5ddabde6,N24News/imgs/54a45255-e9ff-59ff-9ef3-323f5ddabde6.jpg,6
Science,Solving the Scorching Mystery of the Sun's Erupting Plasma Jets,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/science/sun-plasma-jets-spicules.html,"Spiky bursts of plasma called spicules swirl around the surface of the sun. Millions erupt every moment, spurting solar material some 6,000 miles high at speeds of about 60 miles per second.

""These things are very violent,"" said Bart De Pontieu, a research scientist with Lockheed Martin Solar and Astrophysics Lab in Palo Alto, Calif. ""The gas in spicules is about 10,000 degrees and they travel the length of California in just a minute or so.""

Scientists have studied spicules for decades, but were not sure how the plasma jets formed. Now, Dr. De Pontieu and his colleagues think they have solved the searing mystery. They published their findings Thursday in the journal Science.

Using data gathered by high-powered land and space telescopes, they created a computer simulation that reconstructed the conditions between the sun's surface and its atmosphere, where spicules form.","After decades of study, scientists have developed a model to explain how violent solar spicules form.",89fd8b52-1962-5e92-b73f-e751161e7d9e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/24/science/23SOLAR/23SOLAR-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=e5d73e666c54c453bb0c91033969fc4bfd341c71f7ccf2ab36a85604e81caf6c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Jets of solar material called spicules shoot out from the sun.,89fd8b52-1962-5e92-b73f-e751161e7d9e,N24News/imgs/89fd8b52-1962-5e92-b73f-e751161e7d9e.jpg,2
Health,E.P.A. Delays Bans on Uses of Hazardous Chemicals,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/19/health/epa-toxic-chemicals.html,"The Environmental Protection Agency will indefinitely postpone bans on certain uses of three toxic chemicals found in consumer products, according to an update of the Trump administration's regulatory plans. Critics said the reversal demonstrated the agency's increasing reluctance to use enforcement powers granted to it last year by Congress under the Toxic Substances Control Act. E.P.A. Administrator Scott Pruitt is ""blatantly ignoring Congress's clear directive to the agency to better protect the health and safety of millions of Americans by more effectively regulating some of the most dangerous chemicals known to man,"" said Senator Tom Carper, Democrat of Delaware and the ranking minority member on the Senate Environment and Public Works committee. The E.P.A. declined to comment. In a news release earlier this month, the agency wrote that its ""commonsense, balanced approach carefully protects both public health and the environment while curbing unnecessary regulatory burdens that stifle economic growth for communities across the country.""

Agency officials dropped prohibitions against certain uses of two chemicals from the administration's Unified Agenda of Regulatory and Deregulatory Actions, which details short- and long-term plans of the federal agencies. The third ban was dropped in the spring edition of that report. The proposed bans targeted methylene chloride and N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP), ingredients in paint strippers, and trichloroethylene (TCE), used as a spot cleaner in dry-cleaning and as a degreasing agent. Under an overhaul of the Toxic Substances Control Act last year, the E.P.A. initially is reviewing the risks of ten chemicals, including other uses of these three. The updated law is known as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, named after the late New Jersey senator who had long championed an overhaul of the loophole-ridden toxic substances law. The revised law had strong bipartisan support. The Senate passed the measure on a voice vote; the House approved it 403 to 12. The intention was to give the E.P.A. the authority necessary to require new testing and regulation of thousands of chemicals used in everyday products, from laundry detergents to hardware supplies.

Public health experts had been pushing for faster review of methylene chloride-based paint strippers after several deaths from inhalation, among them a 21-year-old who died recently after stripping a bathtub. It has been several years since the E.P.A. first declared these applications of the three chemicals to be dangerous. The agency itself has found TCE ""carcinogenic to humans by all routes of exposure"" and has reported that it causes developmental and reproductive damage. ""Potential health concerns from exposure to trichloroethylene, based on limited epidemiological data and evidence from animal studies, include decreased fetal growth and birth defects, particularly cardiac birth defects,"" agency officials noted in 2013. Methylene chloride is toxic to the brain and liver, and NMP can harm the reproductive system. Michael Dourson, President Trump's nominee to oversee the E.P.A.'s chemical safety branch, in 2010 represented the Halogenated Solvents Industry Alliance before the E.P.A., which was considering restrictions on TCE. Mr. Dourson, who withdrew his name from consideration last week, had been working as an E.P.A. adviser while awaiting confirmation. The agency did not respond to a query about whether Mr. Dourson had been involved in the evaluation of TCE. The E.P.A. now describes the enforcement actions regarding TCE, methylene chloride and NMP as ""long-term actions'' without a set deadline.","Despite earlier warnings about the dangers, the agency will indefinitely postpone bans on three chemicals used in paint strippers, and in dry-cleaning and degreasing agents.",5c8149f4-bdb5-55b0-b898-93170b77bb63,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/20/science/20EPA1/20EPA1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=3ecea78c7b2a9e878ac940943240f9c1639e57be69c85edb8f8c16829d3114da&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Senator Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, on Capitol Hill in 2012, a year before his death.

Sports,What We Learned From Week 7 of the N.F.L. Season,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/25/sports/football/nfl-results.html,"* None A schedule change made Sunday night special. Fearing that Tampa Bay's game in Las Vegas could be postponed because of coronavirus precautions, the N.F.L. moved Seattle's game in Arizona to the prime time spot. As a result, a national audience was treated to a thriller, with the Seahawks taking a lead in the game's first four minutes and not trailing again until the final play of overtime, when Arizona's Zane Gonzalez connected on a 48-yard field goal that gave the Cardinals a shocking 37-34 victory. Russell Wilson threw for 388 yards and rushed for 84, Kyler Murray threw for 360 and rushed for 67, and Tyler Lockett had 200 yards receiving and three touchdowns. But it was Arizona's defense stepping up in overtime that decided the game. Arizona's pass rush came alive in that extra period, sacking Wilson twice and pressuring him several other times, leading to Seattle's last offensive play in which Wilson rushed a bad pass and had it intercepted by seldom-used linebacker Isaiah Simmons, who put his team in the position to win. ""These are the games you honestly dream about,"" Murray said after his team improved to 5-2 while handing Seattle its first loss of the season.
* None Ohio suddenly has an intrastate rivalry. A game between Cincinnati and Cleveland got off to an inauspicious start when Joe Burrow and Baker Mayfield were both intercepted on their first drives. Odell Beckham Jr. of the Browns was lost to injury on that opening drive, and the Bengals were leading by 17-10 at halftime. But in the second half, the game morphed into a heavyweight bout between Mayfield, the No. 1 pick in the 2018 draft, and Burrow, the No. 1 pick in 2020. Mayfield won the day, finding Donovan Peoples-Jones for a 24-yard touchdown with 11 seconds remaining that put Cleveland ahead to say, 37-34. But Burrow nearly kept up, throwing for 406 yards and three touchdowns.
* None Kansas City can win a game without much help from its offense. Playing in snowy conditions in Denver, the Chiefs were nowhere near their best when they had the ball, going 0 for 8 on third down conversion attempts. But Daniel Sorensen contributed a pick-six, Byron Pringle had a 102-yard kickoff return and the Chiefs demolished the Broncos, 43-16, despite Denver having dramatic advantages in total yards and time of possession.

San Francisco's top running back is Raheem Mostert. Coach Kyle Shanahan may actually prefer Tevin Coleman. The 49ers' third-stringer is Jerick McKinnon, and their highest paid runner out of the backfield is fullback Kyle Juszczyk. Because of injuries to Mostert, Coleman and McKinnon, the team turned to Wilson on Sunday and the former standout for North Texas had the game of his life, racing for 112 yards and scoring three touchdowns. Keeping up with the theme of the season, however, Wilson's big day ended abruptly when he injured his ankle while scoring his third touchdown. The team has yet to weigh in on the full extent of the injury, but Shanahan said it was ""not looking great.""

Buccaneers 45, Raiders 20 Tom Brady continued to spread the ball around, throwing touchdown passes to four different receivers, and Tampa Bay kept its momentum from last week's blowout win over the Packers. Cardinals 37, Seahawks 34 Arizona had several moments that would have caused a lesser team to quit. There was Budda Baker being chased down by DK Metcalf on what would have been a 98-yard interception return for a touchdown. Zane Gonzalez missed an attempt at a game-winner from 41 yards during the Cardinals' first possession in overtime. And Metcalf had what appeared to be a 48-yard game-winning touchdown in overtime negated by a holding penalty. But the Cardinals kept pushing until they had the win in hand.

Chargers 39, Jaguars 29 Justin Herbert got his first career win, and he did it in a big way by throwing for 347 yards and three touchdowns while also running in a score. Herbert has thrown for at least 250 yards in each of his first five starts, a feat previously only accomplished by Patrick Mahomes, who did it in his first 10. Lions 23, Falcons 22 Detroit didn't get much production out of its running backs, but Matthew Stafford threw for 340 yards and a touchdown and the Lions won for the third time in four games. This was the 36th game-winning drive of Stafford's career, according to Pro Football Reference, which trails only Drew Brees (37) since 2009. Footballers 25, Cowboys 3 Ezekiel Elliott was held to just 45 yards rushing, had a ball bounce off him for an interception and made mistakes in pass protection. Blame the team's struggles on Dallas's second- and third-string quarterbacks all you want, but Elliott isn't getting the job done.","Arizona shocked Seattle in overtime, Baker Mayfield caught fire after a rough start and the Steelers held on to beat the Titans.",82d7d0c9-cb75-5e2b-b0b6-d8b7be26cb5b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/11/25/sports/25nfl-wwl-top3/25nfl-wwl-top3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=c5079e0dd5531686cf7d82505753689775fc978474c10ffeeab5fa0447eed4a2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Byron Murphy and Isaiah Simmons celebrated after Simmons intercepted a Russell Wilson pass in overtime, helping set up Arizona's game-winning field goal.",82d7d0c9-cb75-5e2b-b0b6-d8b7be26cb5b,N24News/imgs/82d7d0c9-cb75-5e2b-b0b6-d8b7be26cb5b.jpg,9
Travel,"How to Travel to (and Around) China, From VPNs to T.P.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/30/travel/china-tips-visas-vpn-phone.html,"Wi-Fi is everywhere in China -- but not necessarily for tourists. (Taking a photo in Beijing, however, should be fine.)



China is one of the world's most exciting and rewarding places to visit, but can be intimidating even to experienced travelers, who might struggle with communication and lack of familiarity with rules and customs. Here's a handful of practical tips to help make sure your trip to the world's most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish. The good news: Those annoying and expensive single-entry visas are a thing of the past. Americans can now apply for a 10-year, multiple-entry visa from the Chinese consulate. Download the form from the embassy website, type up the application and bring copies of your travel itinerary to your local consulate or embassy (depending on your location). Several days and a $140 fee later, you should be all set. There are also visa services that, for a fee, will take your application to the consulate for you. One other important note: Passport and visa expiration dates rarely line up exactly, creating situations where a passport might expire while a visa is still valid. I found myself in this exact situation before my last trip -- would I have to go through the whole costly and time-consuming application process again? No -- you are allowed to travel on a valid visa that's in an expired passport as long as personal details like name and date of birth match up exactly (bring both passports). You'll notice blue and green QR codes at nearly every business in China, from the glitziest boutique to the most humble dumpling shop. WeChat Pay and Alipay are gradually turning the Chinese economy cashless: Simply enter the amount you want to pay, scan the business's QR code, and boom, you have paid directly from your bank account. It's something of a revolution -- one that you, as a tourist, will not be a part of.

Cashless payment in China requires a Chinese bank card, which you can't get unless you're a citizen or resident. Don't count on businesses accepting your foreign credit card, either -- you'll frequently find yourself out of luck. So load up on cash when you can -- fortunately, I've never had trouble finding A.T.M.s in Chinese cities, and withdrawing from Chinese currency with my American debit card has been trouble-free. If you want to play it safe, you can exchange for some at your local bank before you go. While you probably won't be participating in the cashless revolution, you will be able to use Didi Chuxing, the Chinese version of Uber (the company, in fact, purchased Uber's operations in China in 2016, forcing them out). I found Didi to be inexpensive and as reliable as Uber is in the United States, with one caveat: paying by credit card. Didi wouldn't accept my Chase card, but did accept one from my credit union. Then, unfortunately, my credit union repeatedly flagged the charges as suspicious, leading to several long phone conversations with the fraud department. While not foolproof, you can set a travel notification on the card you plan to use before you leave. You can also enroll in text notifications for fraudulent activity, which allow you to verify the veracity of charges right away. Speaking of phone conversations, I found the best way to cheaply make calls was through the WeChat app. A $9.99 credit (which comes with a $2.50 bonus), purchased within the app, lasts a long time. Calls to the United States are only a penny per minute, and the sound quality is decent. Texting on WeChat is easy, and I was also able to use iMessage without issue. WhatsApp is blocked in China. While you should always remain alert, China is remarkably safe for foreigners. In total, I've spent over a year in China, and have never felt in danger or threatened while walking around, no matter the hour. Chinese traffic, however, can be horrendous, and navigating streets as a pedestrian is always an adventure. Buckle up when in a vehicle, and be extremely careful when crossing the street: Cars do not necessarily yield to pedestrians, and motorcycles and scooters do not seem to yield to anything -- not even red lights.

While you won't be able to buy a SIM card for your phone that includes a Chinese phone number, data plans with 4G speed are available for foreigners. Check at the airport (I bought one in a convenience store), or at the hostel or hotel where you're staying, and be ready to show your passport. Wi-Fi is everywhere in China, from the pricey malls of Shanghai to modest mom-and-pop restaurants in the smaller cities. The bad news is that you won't be able to access it some of the time, as it frequently requires you to enter a local phone number to receive a Wi-Fi access code. There are ways to circumvent this. Having a WeChat account will grant access to certain Wi-Fi networks. I also use a Google Voice number to receive internet access codes, which works part of the time. But wait -- isn't Google blocked in China? That brings us to ... The Chinese government does a fairly thorough job censoring websites and traffic from sources it deems potentially unsavory or damaging to the ruling Communist Party. Say goodbye to Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, any Google-related services (including Gmail), and even (gasp!) The New York Times. There are, however, a few holes in the Great Firewall, as it is called. Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, essentially function as tunnels under the aforementioned firewall, connecting to a private network in a country with more internet freedom, like the United States or Japan. (VPNs are a legal gray area in China. The unauthorized business or commercial use of VPNs in China is not legal, but tourists checking their email or Facebook are not likely to run into problems.) While it's a fairly easy way for you -- and almost every young Chinese person I interacted with -- to connect with the outside world, VPNs do have limitations: They can slow traffic noticeably, and aren't always reliable. There are a number of well-reviewed VPNs with names like Golden Frog and NordVPN -- I opted for one called ExpressVPN, which costs $12.95 per month and offers a discount if you purchase a yearly subscription. I'd put my overall connection success rate between 85 and 90 percent. I also tried a free service called TunnelBear with slightly less consistent results. TunnelBear is free up to 500 megabytes of data per month -- after that, you'll have to pay. To get an idea of how long that will last you, loading The Times home page and clicking on an article consumed 6 megabytes. One obvious, but essential, tip: Download and set up your VPN before you leave for China. Once you're there, you'll be blocked from downloading any VPNs.

If you're like me, you've come to depend on Google Maps considerably during your travels. In China, you would be wise to rid yourself of that notion. Even with a VPN, Google Maps in China is filled with incomplete or sometimes just flat-out incorrect information. For example: There are no fewer than six subway lines currently operating in Chengdu. According to Google Maps, there are just two. I recommend downloading the app Tencent Maps for your trip. While it can be difficult to navigate for those who don't read Chinese, it's worth having for its accuracy. Moreover, it will sometimes recognize English words you input (""airport,"" and names of some businesses, for example). It also does a great job plotting out directions. Just drop a pin (like you would in Google Maps) on a location in Tencent Maps, and it will give you accurate public transportation, driving, or walking directions. WeChat dominates the country and is used to keep in touch with friends, pay for meals in restaurants, get news and play games -- it even serves as something of a dating app. Download it if you're going to spend any significant amount of time in China, as you will need it to keep in touch with locals you meet along the way. Just don't use the messaging feature to say anything you wouldn't want the Chinese government to read -- your privacy protections are nil (WeChat disputes the extent to which it stores and shares information with Chinese authorities). I've found Pleco to be a useful translation app -- you can drop in English words, or paste in Chinese characters to receive their counterparts. And Dianping, the Chinese version of Yelp, is helpful for finding restaurants. You'll notice plenty of well-maintained public restrooms in China, but they're not always stocked with toilet paper. You would be wise to carry a small stash with you. This applies to napkins in restaurants as well -- at smaller, more casual places, diners are expected to have their own supply on hand.",A handful of practical tips to help make sure your next trip to the world's most populous country is smooth sailing from start to finish.,cfef30e3-c198-553a-b036-fc8efdf31698,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/03/08/travel/04frugal1/04frugal1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=7d4f7e52dcbec665923825e4c7c5aee4fd9189b1ee6d90d699d5232f7dd2706d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Wi-Fi is everywhere in China &mdash; but not necessarily for tourists.

Theater,Forget 'Game of Thrones.' No One Does Violence Like Euripides.,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/02/theater/ivo-van-hove-electre-oreste-comedie-franciase.html,"PARIS -- Long-separated siblings looking to avenge their father, an ancient dynasty under threat, savage murders and even a penis chopped off. No, this isn't the final season of ""Game of Thrones"" but two plays written nearly 2,500 years ago: Euripides' ""Electra"" and ""Orestes,"" newly staged at the Comedie-Francaise by the Belgian director Ivo van Hove. The production is a timely reminder that for a fraction of the cost of big-budget TV and movies, theater can still hold its own when it comes to larger-than-life sagas. Mr. van Hove's operatic, mud-soaked ""Electre/Oreste"" finds psychological truth in Euripides' classical tragedies -- with the help of a little choreography in lieu of CGI. The tireless director has combined the two plays into one uninterrupted staging, a strategy he has used in the past: His ""Roman Tragedies"" (2007) and ""Kings of War"" (2015) each stitched together several Shakespeare plays. Euripides' ""Orestes"" picks up five days after the conclusion of ""Electra,"" but it's as if no time has passed. After Electra and Orestes conspire to kill their mother, Clytemnestra, and her lover in the first play, the siblings face justice and spiral into further violence in the second. None of the elements that make up Mr. van Hove's production are especially original on their own. A quartet of percussionists is in the background throughout and creates an ominous soundscape for the action, in a manner reminiscent of classical Japanese theater. (This is acknowledged in the playbill.) The thick layer of mud onstage, meanwhile, brings to mind Pina Bausch's earthy ""Rite of Spring,"" and the comparison doesn't stop there. The action is interspersed with ritualistic dance scenes led by Electra and the Chorus, who beat their chests and fall repeatedly into the mud. While the choreography was created by Wim Vandekeybus, it is indebted to the raw, primal spasms that drove Ms. Bausch's dancers to exhaustion.

Yet Mr. van Hove knows exactly how to measure his ingredients, and he draws maximum tension out of the interplay of dance, music and text. ""Electre/Oreste,"" which will be shown live in cinemas worldwide on May 23, is aesthetically very different from the director's first production for the Comedie-Francaise in 2016, a video-heavy adaptation of Luchino Visconti's film ""The Damned."" Still, both productions lay bare the brutality of intergenerational tragedies, and the subtle ways in which violence begets violence over time. A number of Comedie-Francaise actors from ""The Damned"" return in ""Electre/Oreste,"" starting with the idiosyncratic Christophe Montenez, by turns rabid and vulnerable as Orestes. Elsa Lepoivre plays the two women murdered by the siblings, Clytemnestra in ""Electra"" and her sister, Helen, in ""Orestes,"" with beautiful attention to detail. When Clytemnestra visits Electra, who was married off to a poor peasant, her awkward stumble as she steps into the mud in a gown and heels speaks to the class differences Euripides examines in the play. Those divisions are evident throughout. The noble characters' royal blue costumes stand out against the brown and black color scheme, and quickly stain in the mud. Electra is highly conscious and ashamed of her social demotion, and yet, at times, embraces it as a form of liberation. She is by far the most interesting character in the plays, with an inner resolve and appetite for violence that outstrip her guilt-stricken brother's, and Mr. van Hove found the right actress in the underrated Suliane Brahim. With her cropped hair and tattered shorts, Ms. Brahim cuts an androgynous figure, who doesn't just maim Clytemnestra's lover, Aegisthus, but bites into his dismembered genitals before throwing them at the Chorus. Electra's relationship with the members of the Chorus is one of the strengths of ""Electre/Oreste."" As the peasants wash themselves from the same bucket as Ms. Brahim and join her in fervent dances, they seem like a surrogate family, joined in misery.

Mr. van Hove has made some cuts to Euripides. He skips the divine apparition at the end of ""Electra,"" for instance, but maintains the deus ex machina that concludes ""Orestes."" Apollo (Gael Kalimindi) appears to restore the peace, and tells Orestes that he must marry Hermione, Helen's daughter, whose throat he was just about to slit. (A few awkward laughs ensued.) But then, as the god disappears, in a final flash, we see Orestes about to stab Hermione regardless. In Mr. van Hove's world, violence isn't so easily stemmed.

The British playwright Dennis Kelly thanks Euripides in the acknowledgments for ""Girls and Boys,"" staged by Melanie Leray at the Theatre du Petit Saint-Martin, and it's not hard to see why. The family killings at the play's heart reverse the story of Medea, the subject of another of the Greek tragedian's plays. Here, it's a father who takes revenge on his estranged wife by murdering their two children. It's a grim plot, and to Mr. Kelly's credit, he builds up to the crime masterfully. ""Girls and Boys"" is a monologue told from the perspective of the unnamed mother, and it's easy to miss the clues in the first half that horror awaits. While she tells us in the first sentence that she took an ""instant dislike"" to her future husband, her recollection of their first encounter, in Italy in the queue to board an easyJet flight, is delightfully funny. (My companion, who hadn't read the playbill, thought she was in for a comedy about a marriage.) ""Girls and Boys"" had its initial run in London and New York last year, starring Carey Mulligan. For the French premiere, Ms. Leray cast Constance Dolle, another experienced stage and film actress. Her performance has already earned her a nomination at the Molieres, France's most prestigious theater awards, and it's well deserved. She takes to the role with an irrepressible animation that eventually makes her understated pain near the end all the more striking. Mr. Kelly doesn't specify to whom or where the woman is telling her story, but here, she isn't completely alone onstage: Every night, four volunteers from the audience sit around a set dinner table with her. They aren't required to interact, but their presence enhances the text's conversational feel. One recent night, the three women and one man at the table nodded and tutted at regular intervals as Ms. Dolle's eyes darted among them. Philippe Le Moine's French translation of ""Girls and Boys"" captures the woman's working-class background and pluckiness. She is a bright, self-aware narrator, stopping at times to relive memories with her absent children before adding matter-of-factly: ""I mean it's not like I think they're actually here."" Ms. Dolle's character may be struggling to make sense of her own story, but she won't be victimized, even in the face of unspeakable tragedy.",Two productions in Paris with their roots in the Greek playwright's works explore the nature of human brutality.

Science,A Speedier Way to Catalog Human Cells (All 37 Trillion of Them),https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/17/science/cells-human-body-sci-rna-seq.html,"A Speedier Way to Catalog Human Cells (All 37 Trillion of Them)

There are some questions in biology that you'd think were settled long ago. For instance: How many types of cells are there in the human body? ""If you just Google this, the number everyone uses is 200,"" said Jay Shendure, a geneticist at the University of Washington. ""But to me that seems absurdly low."" A number of scientists like him want to build a more complete catalog. Yet there are an estimated 37 trillion cells in the human body. The traditional ways to identify cell types -- such as carefully tracing the shape of individual cells under a microscope -- are too slow and crude for the job. On Thursday, Dr. Shendure and his colleagues published a report describing a speedy new method for taking such a cell census. Instead of inspecting one cell at a time, they measured the activity of genes inside 42,035 cells at once.

Although still at an experimental stage, the method may become an essential tool for cataloging every cell type in the human body, experts said. ""It's a really important piece of work,"" said David M. Miller, a cell biologist at Vanderbilt University, who was not involved in the study. ""With this approach, you can do more for a whole lot less work, and a whole lot less money."" In the laboratory, scientists easily discern the difference between, say, a muscle and a nerve cell. But these broad categories encompass many different types of cells. A muscle cell might be a skeletal muscle cell, the kind you use to walk or lift a cup. Or it might be a smooth muscle cell lining your small intestines, making it ripple with contractions. Our hearts are built of special muscle cells all their own, known as cardiomyocytes. Even these come in different types. Some contract the chambers to pump blood, for example, while others conduct electric impulses around the heart.

Genetically speaking, all cells in the body are identical. They all carry the same 20,000 or so protein-coding genes. What distinguishes each type is the particular combination of genes the cell uses to make proteins. The first step in this process is making a copy of the gene in the form of a molecule called RNA. The cell uses the RNA molecule as a template to build a protein. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues reasoned that the distinctive collection of RNA molecules floating around inside a cell could provide clues about the cell's type. To measure that RNA, they developed a kind of molecular ""bar coding."" In the first step, the researchers pour thousands of cells into hundreds of miniature ""wells."" Each well contains molecular tags that attach themselves to every RNA molecule inside the cells. The process is repeated two or more times until each cell ends up with a unique combination of tags attached to its RNA molecules. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues then break open the cells and read the sequences of tags at once. The ""bar codes"" allow the scientists to see which genes are active in each cell. Cells of the same type should share many of those genes in common. ""We came up with this scheme that allows us to look at very large numbers of cells at the same time, without ever isolating a single cell,"" said Dr. Shendure.

He and his colleagues call their method sci-RNA-seq (short for single-cell combinatorial indexing RNA sequencing). To test it, they set out to classify every cell in a tiny worm, Caenorhabditis elegans. Scientists know more about C. elegans's cells than any other animal's. In the 1960s, the biologist Sydney Brenner made it a model for investigating biological development. Dr. Brenner and later generations of scientists tracked the worm's growth from a single cell to about 1,000 cells at maturity, classifying them into types with a microscope. Eventually, scientists plucked individual cells from the worm's body and painstakingly measured their DNA activity. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues decided to see how results from sci-RNA-seq compared to those from decades of research. They raised 150,000 C. elegans larvae and then doused them with chemicals that broke them apart into individual cells. (Each larva has 762 cells, not counting the cells that will become eggs or sperm.) They then tagged all the RNA in the cells. With the new method, the researchers were able to identify 27 cell types that had been identified in previous studies. But the team also was able to break them down into smaller groups, each with a slightly different pattern of gene activity. They identified 40 different kinds of neurons, for example, including very rare types. In few cases, only a single such neuron develops in each worm.

""I was excited because it worked extremely well -- they uncovered results that will be valuable for me and for the whole field,"" said Cori Bargmann, an expert on C. elegans at the Rockefeller University. Yet for now, sci-RNA-seq falls far short of capturing the full complexity of cell types, even in such a simple animal. Dr. Shendure and his colleagues could not match some of their clusters of neurons to a known type of cell, and they did not find most of the 118 different types of neurons that earlier studies have documented. ""We don't consider this a finished project,"" said Dr. Shendure. Dr. Bargmann and her colleagues are already trying to match Dr. Shendure's results to neurons in the worm. ""Of course, there is more to do, but I am pretty optimistic that this can be solved,"" she said. Sarah A. Teichmann, a cell biologist at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute who was not involved in the new study, said the report illustrated how fast the field of cell-typing has moved. In a review posted on the pre-publication service Arxiv, Dr. Teichmann and her colleagues noted that it was only in 2009 that scientists managed to measure gene activity this way in a single cell. They broke the thousand-cell barrier just three years ago. This exponential increase will be crucial to the success of the Human Cell Atlas, an international initiative of which Dr. Teichmann is a joint leader. The researchers plan to create a complete catalog of every cell type in the human body.","Many types of cells remain unknown, but researchers have discovered a faster way to group cells by function, paving the way for a complete census.",2caf0b03-0ce9-5363-9aba-8faece70ddf3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/08/22/science/22SCI-ZIMMER/22SCI-ZIMMER-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=9831ea893008c90d5ee64018f34704f222e2ecbbdf74e3a2665de2effd45ddf3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A light micrograph showing Caenorhabditis elegans, a worm in which scientists used a new method to determine cell types.",2caf0b03-0ce9-5363-9aba-8faece70ddf3,N24News/imgs/2caf0b03-0ce9-5363-9aba-8faece70ddf3.jpg,2

Theater,Review: A Scam Artist's Masterwork in 'Six Degrees of Separation',https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/25/theater/six-degrees-of-separation-review.html,"That dangerous young man who calls himself Paul Poitier has grown up in the 27 years since he first set foot on a New York stage. All right, perhaps not ""grown up,"" since we're still talking about a narcissistic con artist of adolescent fecklessness and zero self-knowledge. But there's no doubt that he has grown in stature and, in a paradoxical way, truthfulness. This is because Paul Poitier (not his real name) has been embodied with tremulous, searching sensitivity by the screen actor Corey Hawkins in the earthbound revival of John Guare's marvelous ""Six Degrees of Separation,"" which opened on Tuesday night at the Ethel Barrymore Theater, with the estimable Allison Janney and John Benjamin Hickey as Paul's plump society pigeons. Equal parts radiance and shadow, Mr. Hawkins transforms a fatally mixed-up character into something close to a tragic hero. With this production, directed by Trip Cullman, Paul takes his place more fully as one of the great pretenders, or less-than-great Gatsbys, who populate Mr. Guare's work -- the ravenously aspirational outsiders in a culture that worships wealth and celebrity. Mind you, one of the points of ""Six Degrees"" is that everybody feels like an outsider, including those in the V.I.P. rooms. In this uncannily empathetic satire from 1990, a well-heeled couple on the Upper East Side of Manhattan -- Flan Kittredge (Mr. Hickey), an art dealer, and his wife, Ouisa (Ms. Janney) -- come to realize just how tenuous their foothold on the good life is, when Paul stumbles into their world one night.

It's a strategic stumble. Paul arrives in a comme il faut navy blazer and a somewhat less presentable shirt, as it's wet with blood. Paul has been stabbed by a mugger, it appears. But even in distress, he's a charmer. And since he claims to be friends with Flan and Ouisa's children at Harvard -- and, oh, by the way, lets it slip that he's the son of one Sidney Poitier -- he winds up staying for dinner. And nobody's life, as the ad copy for best-selling novels likes to say, will ever be the same again. ""Six Degrees"" was inspired by a true story, which was making the rounds of dinner parties not long after I arrived in New York. (I first heard it across a crowded table in a Gracie Square penthouse in the early 1980s.) No doubt many people thought then that this sensational anecdote could be a marvelous work of fiction. But it was Mr. Guare who ran with the idea, and he was singularly well equipped to do so. Many of his early plays -- including ""Rich and Famous"" and the haunting ""The House of Blue Leaves"" -- had depicted eccentric have-nots who dreamed obsessively of hobnobbing with boldfaced names.

As his profile as a writer grew, Mr. Guare himself became a boldfaced entity. ""Six Degrees"" is shaped by the acute double vision of someone who has seen both sides of the New York social equation and understands that success doesn't stop you from feeling like a fraud. And who better to reflect that uneasy self-image than a scam artist, especially one who wants to become the very people he's scamming? That's the genius of Mr. Guare's conception of Paul, whose elusive back story is pursued, detectivelike, by Ouisa and her friends after he's unmasked. An African-American man whom rich white liberals feel they can embrace as one of their own, he's a flattering mirror to those he preys upon; at the same time, he's a grotesque fun-house distortion of them. Not for nothing is the play's central image a double-sided painting by Kandinsky. Such a painting is suspended in slow rotation, like a sword of Damocles, over Mark Wendland's blood-red set for this latest revival, in which Ouisa and Flan's living room seems to seep into an endless cityscape beyond. What's most fascinating about revisiting ""Six Degrees,"" or at least this version, is seeing how its center of gravity has shifted. In Jerry Zaks's 1990 production for Lincoln Center Theater, the show (for me) was all about Ouisa, portrayed by Stockard Channing in a career-high performance. It's Ouisa, who, well into the play, makes the revelatory ""six degrees"" speech, about how everyone can be connected to everyone else through six other people (a notion that has since become an omnipresent cultural meme). Ms. Channing's sweet-and-tart air of perplexity, as Ouisa tried to figure out just what made Paul run, paralleled the leap of imagination that we in the audience were trying to make.

But she's also tougher, less of a fantasist and more of a pragmatist. This may be partly to balance Mr. Hickey, whose Flan is more frivolous and featherweight than John Cunningham's was in the original production. While this take lends a not inappropriate whiff of sexual ambiguity to Flan, it also fits into the broader comic dimensions of Mr. Cullman's framework. The deception of the Kittredges and their society pals always had its farcical elements. But they have been heightened here at the expense of poignancy, especially in the scenes involving the disapproving, college-age children of the play's New York socialites. It's a tone that screeches as the play becomes darker, especially in the sequences involving Paul's gulling of a naive aspiring actor. He is affectingly embodied here by Peter Mark Kendall, and his character's wondering post-mortem of his encounter with Paul remains a near-perfect monologue. The figure in the play who rings truest, though, is its most fully deluded. Or is he? In the 1990 production, Paul was convincingly embodied by James McDaniel, but he registered more as conceptual catalyst than complex character. Mr. Hawkins, best known for his performance as Dr. Dre in the film ""Straight Outta Compton,"" gives us a Paul who is a truth-teller in spite of himself. Even when he's cribbing someone else's graduation speech from Groton (about ""The Catcher in the Rye"") to impress his fancy new hosts, he speaks with a penetrating conviction that has you nodding in agreement. As the play continues, Paul's identity becomes ever more porous. He appears in the Kittredges' dreams and in flashbacks that portray the making of this charlatan (with a smitten M.I.T. student, nicely played by Chris Perfetti, as his Henry Higgins). Yet Mr. Hawkins finds an emotional solidity in the slipperiness, an abiding ache of yearning that translates into continuing, self-doubting and self-asserting self-transformation. He becomes the yin and yang of imagination incarnate. ""I believe that imagination is the passport we create to take us into the real world,"" he says. And out of it too. Mr. Guare's beautiful play, even in a less than ideal production, makes complete use of this double-edged license to travel.",Corey Hawkins soars as a great pretender in this otherwise earthbound revival of John Guare's masterwork.,a40d5596-6fcc-58e4-ae94-fc44a3dda8ee,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/26/arts/26sixdegrees/-26sixdegrees-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=21f683e7763fd3c50674f5984501f04785eac2c91424a76f7c21f0f6b12e64da&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"From left, Allison Janney, John Benjamin Hickey and Corey Hawkins in a revival of John Guare's ""Six Degrees of Separation"" at the Ethel Barrymore Theater.",a40d5596-6fcc-58e4-ae94-fc44a3dda8ee,N24News/imgs/a40d5596-6fcc-58e4-ae94-fc44a3dda8ee.jpg,10
Technology,Apple and Epic Games Spar Over Returning Fortnite to the App Store,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/technology/apple-epic-app-court.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- Apple and Epic Games, the maker of Fortnite, sparred in federal court on Monday over whether to reinstate the popular game in Apple's App Store, raising antitrust arguments that may reshape a key part of the internet economy and the way people use smartphones. In a three-hour videoconference hearing in the Northern District of California, Epic laid out its allegations that Apple had abused its power. Their fight began last month when Epic tried collecting its own payments for Fortnite without going through the App Store, breaking Apple's rules. Apple then booted Fortnite from the App Store; Epic responded by suing Apple, accusing it of violating antitrust laws. On Monday, Epic said Apple's unwillingness to let it use its own payment system was anticompetitive and monopolistic. Apple countered that Epic had created a ""self-inflicted wound"" by not complying with its payment policy. Apple also said Epic had plenty of alternative ways to distribute its games. Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers concluded the hearing by recommending a jury trial in the case in July. In the coming days, she is expected to rule on whether Apple must allow Fortnite back into its App Store and support Unreal Engine, Epic's software development tools, in the interim.

The battle is playing out as scrutiny of the power of the tech giants ramps up. Lawmakers, regulators, academics and activists are increasingly taking issue with the reach of Apple, Amazon, Facebook and Google in people's lives. For months, the Department of Justice, the Federal Trade Commission, state attorneys general and House lawmakers have investigated the clout of the companies and whether they stifle competition and harm consumers. Those inquiries are set to come to a head soon. The Justice Department is poised to sue Google on claims of anticompetitive search practices, while Congress is expected to release a report of a yearlong antitrust investigation into the big technology platforms. Much of the scrutiny of Apple has centered on the power it holds over developers in its App Store. Apple and Google control access to apps on virtually all of the world's smartphones through their iOS and Android operating systems. The companies charge a 30 percent fee for purchases made inside apps in their app stores. And they make their own apps that compete with those of independent developers. Apple has long said that all app developers are subject to the same rules, and that its commission is fair. But Epic has said Apple's power creates an unlevel playing field and is unfair. Apple's 30 percent cut of fees, for instance, is too high a tax on commerce, the games maker has said. It is seeking the option to use its own payment method and publish its own app store within Apple's and Google's systems. Last week, Epic joined with Spotify, Match Group and other independent developers to form a nonprofit coalition to push for changes in the app stores and to ""protect the app economy.""

But by taking on Apple so directly and publicly, Epic -- a 29-year-old privately held company worth $17.3 billion and based in Cary, N.C. -- may be in for the fight of its life. Apple has a market capitalization of nearly $2 trillion and almost unlimited resources. Last month, it cut off its support for Epic's Unreal Engine, a software development tool that thousands of developers use. That took the smaller company by surprise. ""We recognized the theoretical possibility in advance, but thought it would be so foolish of"" Apple to cut off Unreal Engine, Tim Sweeney, Epic's founder and chief executive, said in an interview last week. In court on Monday, Judge Gonzalez Rogers sharply criticized Epic's decision last month to break with Apple's payment rules. ""There are plenty of people in the public who consider you guys heroes for what you did, but it's still not honest,"" she said. Epic argued that Fortnite's removal from the App Store had caused it irreparable harm. But Judge Gonzales Rogers noted that Epic's publicity campaign around the fight, including a parody video of Apple's famous ""1984"" ad and a hashtag, #FreeFortnite, had probably increased good will toward the company. Epic's attorney, Katherine B. Forrest, a partner at Cravath, Swaine & Moore, defended the publicity campaign. ""When you are taking on the biggest company in the world and you know it's going to retaliate, you don't lie down in the street and die,"" she said. ""You plan very carefully."" Apple said it would reinstate Fortnite to its App Store only if Epic complied with its rules. ""They don't need this court's emergency help -- they have the keys to free Fortnite right there in their pocket,"" said Apple's attorney, Theodore J. Boutrous Jr., a partner at Gibson Dunn.","The two companies argued in federal court over Apple's power over apps, as their fight heads to trial next year.",5d891f61-fbd1-5a26-bceb-64149d46244d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/28/business/28apple/merlin_176133924_ddaa9685-b3dd-4052-8000-8cdb0994fff6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6c4851f41892c72ba2eeef7239e353b37c464fd869680f4402f613e118bc891e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Apple booted Fortnite, a popular video game made by Epic Games, out of its App Store last month.",5d891f61-fbd1-5a26-bceb-64149d46244d,N24News/imgs/5d891f61-fbd1-5a26-bceb-64149d46244d.jpg,20
Theater,Molière's Still Funny (Even in German),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/13/theater/moliere-berlin-schaubuehne-deutsches-theater.html,"BERLIN -- There aren't so many comedy gems in German theater. It's little wonder, then, that when German-speaking artists discovered Moliere, France's great 17th-century comic playwright, they set about making him their own. It was Moliere's dramatization of the Don Juan legend that served as the basis for Mozart's ""Don Giovanni""; much later, the great actor Emil Jannings gave the definitive screen treatment of ""Tartuffe,"" Moliere's famous charlatan, in F.W. Murnau's 1926 silent classic. In between, the playwright Heinrich von Kleist wrote his tragicomedy ""Amphitryon"" (1807), based on Moliere's 1668 farce of the same name. Rarely performed nowadays, ""Amphitryon"" is one of the highlights of the theater season in Berlin, where Herbert Fritsch has staged it with manic verve at the Schaubuhne. A Theban general returns home to find the god Jupiter has taken over his identity and is hotly pursuing his wife. Along with the mayhem and misunderstanding that ensue, the play vibrates with anxieties about identity: Its doppelganger theme feels surprisingly modern. Fritsch is known for his gleefully frantic style. His productions are brightly colored and heavy on physical comedy, usually without props but with plenty of music. His 2012 production ""Murmel Murmel"" consisted of actors repeating a single word -- the German for ""mumbling.""

Compared with that and other Fritsch productions, ""Amphitryon"" places more emphasis on the text, which is mostly rendered faithfully (though Fritsch throws some French, dispatched with outrageous accents, into Arthur Luther's German translation). It's certainly more prolix and anchored by dialogue. You sense the director has become punch-drunk from Moliere's verbal acrobatics. Which is not to say that Fritsch's bracing brand of physical comedy is absent. Moliere took much from the Italian commedia dell'arte tradition, and Fritsch's production highlights this influence in its exaggerated and ritualized gestures -- but with the sped-up energy of a silent comedy by Chaplin or Keaton and a dose of schlocky overacting. If, like me, you're a sucker for outrageous baroque fashion, Victoria Behr's riotously colorful sartorial creations are alone worth the price of admission. On the sides of the stage, a pianist and a marimba player add a percussive soundtrack as the eight-person cast waltzes, jumps and shuffles across the stage. This comes across as a reimagining of the ""comedie-ballet,"" the hybrid medium that combined drama, music and dance, which Moliere collaborated with the leading French composers of his day to produce. The propulsive music (by Ingo Gunther, on piano) helps pull the evening together and gives the intermission-less two-hour show a hypnotic rhythm. But the soundscape and the candy-colored costumes and set (a series of paper banners that suggest baroque stagecraft) work as elegantly as they do only thanks to the dynamic and accomplished performances that Fritsch coaxes from the Schaubuhne actors. Much of his past work has relied on precision and formal restraints; here, he has given the players enormous freedom, and the result is both exuberant and tight. The actors are enthralling individually, but the performance gains a supercharge when their wild energies come together, for instance when the entire cast belts out a pop ballad demanding vengeance for the cuckolded general.

In the title role, Florian Anderer anxiously tries to maintain his composure in the face of ever-mounting absurdity. (The fact that Jupiter, played smugly by Axel Wandtke, is a vain old playboy who looks nothing like Anderer adds to the hilarity.) Joachim Meyerhoff, who joined the Schaubuhne's ensemble this season, makes his debut here as Sosie, Amphitryon's equally flabbergasted servant. From his lengthy opening monologue onward, Meyerhoff brilliantly combines a fine-grained sensitivity to the text with comic instincts. Over the length of the show, he proves himself equally adept with Fritsch's onstage antics and the subtler, more subdued aspects of the role. His is the standout performance, although Annika Meier and Carol Schuler are exuberant and feisty as the wives who have unknowingly consorted with the gods. ""Amphitryon"" was the only time Moliere ascended to Olympian heights in search of material. His better-known plays find the comedy in foibles, deceptions and misunderstandings that are all too human.

Across town at the Deutsches Theater, the young German director Anne Lenk has served up a sleek staging of ""The Misanthrope"" that is the tonal opposite of Fritsch's loud, eccentric production. But despite its edgier trappings -- a darkly minimal set, stylish modern costumes -- it, too, is highly faithful to the text, which is performed in a modern, rhyming translation by Jurgen Gosch and Wolfgang Wiens. Ulrich Matthes leads a strong cast as the cantankerous, rude and generally unpleasant Alceste, who despises the hypocrisy of polite society. (In the first performance, in 1666, Moliere himself took this role.) Alceste has the rotten luck of being smitten by Celimene, a social butterfly and incorrigible flirt whose behavior epitomizes everything that Alceste loathes. Over the course of the play, the lovers quarrel and reconcile -- repeatedly -- in ways that seem bracingly contemporary and realistic. The young actress Franziska Machens's Celimene is a strong-willed presence, and she matches Matthes, one of the Deutsches Theater's biggest stars, in toughness and resolve. Florian Losche's black box set resembles a playpen fenced in by tautly stretched elastic bands through which the actors force themselves on- and offstage. The large cubicle looks like some immersive installation room you might find hidden in one of the new wings of the expanded Museum of Modern Art in New York. The periodic bursts of electronic music and flashing lights, not to mention the modish costumes, suggest a trendy nightclub. In this world of ultrafashionable fops -- several of Celimene's suitors seem so obviously gay that the fact that Alceste feels threatened appears to be part of the joke -- Matthes's Alceste is a lethal killjoy.

With its brooding and moral indignation, Matthes's interpretation has a touch of Hamlet in it, which helps make this ""Misanthrope"" the weightier -- and more German -- of Berlin's two current Moliere offerings. Lenk's sure-footed direction is drier and wrier than Fritsch's. Moliere's sparkling wit still comes through beautifully, but Lenk resists succumbing to silliness the way Fritsch does, a decision informed, at least in part, by her source material. As social satire, ""The Misanthrope"" is by far the more pointed and shrewder of the two plays. Lenk makes clear the moral stakes of Alceste's behavior and never lets us lose sight of the consequences of his intransigence; Fritsch, dealing with a romp about deceptive appearances and unstable identities, hits the mark with a far lighter touch. Local critics have complained that this ""Amphitryon"" is all a bit too silly, and it has garnered Fritsch a fair share of bad reviews. Not that theatergoers here seem to care. Like ""The Misanthrope,"" it's sold out through the end of the year. It's good to see that 350 years after his death, Moliere still has Berlin audiences rolling in the aisles. Amphitryon.

Technology,"Facebook Back on the Defensive, Now Over Data Deals With Device Makers",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/04/technology/facebook-device-partnerships-criticized.html,"Facebook endured a new wave of criticism from lawmakers and regulators in the United States and Europe on Monday after disclosures that the social media giant had allowed dozens of hardware manufacturers access to its trove of personal user data. Just months after being forced to explain its privacy measures and pledging reforms in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook found itself on the defensive once again, fending off questions about whether company executives had misled elected officials and why it had not fully disclosed the data-sharing agreements during recent testimony in the United States and Europe. The European authorities who last month enacted the world's strictest data privacy law said Facebook's sharing of personal information with cellphone makers and other manufacturers deserved further investigation. Germany's top privacy regulator, Johannes Caspar, called Facebook's partnerships ""an unprecedented violation of privacy laws and user trust."" And New York's attorney general, Barbara Underwood, said her office would expand its investigation of Facebook's data practices to include Facebook's sharing with hardware manufacturers.

The broad scope of Facebook's data partnerships -- with Apple, Samsung, Amazon and other companies that make or sell phones, tablets, televisions and video game consoles -- was reported by The New York Times on Sunday, showing that Facebook had exempted at least 60 hardware makers from restrictions imposed on other companies in 2015. Those restrictions were intended to prevent games and other apps from gaining access to the Facebook information of their customers' friends. ""I'm extremely concerned that we are just now learning that even more personal user data was provided without consent,"" said Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, a senior Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, and one of the lawmakers who questioned Facebook's chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, at a hearing in April. Mr. Zuckerberg and other Facebook executives have repeatedly cited the 2015 restrictions to assure policymakers that no outside company could again harvest swaths of personal information without the explicit consent of users, as a contractor for Cambridge Analytica did in 2014. But Facebook officials said this week that they did not consider hardware partners to be outside companies, under the terms of Facebook's privacy policies and a 2011 consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission. When Facebook delivers data to a partner device, a Facebook executive said in a statement posted on the company's website Sunday night, the device maker effectively functions as an extension of Facebook. And when Facebook users decide to share photos or phone numbers with their friends, they also consent to having that information flow to any partner devices their friends use. ""Friends' information, like photos, was only accessible on devices when people made a decision to share their information with those friends,"" said the executive, Ime Archibong. ""We are not aware of any abuse by these companies.""

But some American lawmakers criticized Facebook's rationale and urged the F.T.C. to review whether the partnerships violated Facebook's promises to the regulator. ""I think this explanation is completely inadequate and potentially disingenuous,"" said Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat and ranking member of the Senate subcommittee charged with consumer protection. ""I think Mark Zuckerberg's testimony raises very serious and severe questions about Facebook's credibility."" David Cicilline of Rhode Island, the top Democrat on the House antitrust subcommittee, responded even more harshly. ""Sure looks like Zuckerberg lied to Congress about whether users have 'complete control' over who sees our data on Facebook,"" Mr. Cicilline wrote on Twitter. Senior Republicans also said the partnerships merited further review. Senator John Thune, Republican of South Dakota, said in a statement that The Times's reporting ""raises important questions about transparency and potential privacy risks for Facebook users."" Mr. Thune said the Senate Commerce Committee, of which he is chairman, would seek more information from Facebook. The F.T.C. is already investigating whether the access to friends' data that Facebook allowed until 2015 violated the terms of its earlier consent decree with the regulator. Rohit Chopra, a current F.T.C. commissioner, declined to comment on any specific company or investigation, but said he believed that the commission would act to enforce any agreements it had with companies. ""Too often, sensitive consumer data gets shared and copied over and over again to a point of no return,"" Mr. Chopra said. ""F.T.C. orders are not suggestions. When companies violate them, there can be serious consequences.""",Facebook is fending off questions from lawmakers and regulators about partnerships that allowed device makers access to data on users and their friends.,0b9b9542-dd2c-5240-8908-198922051790,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/05/us/05facebook/05facebook-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f2123ffe057661b21a3b8ee30e6cccf0f83973d7ff9e487e4a183c55685847bc&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Facebook, whose chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, appeared before European lawmakers in Brussels last month, is facing new questions about its privacy protections.",0b9b9542-dd2c-5240-8908-198922051790,N24News/imgs/0b9b9542-dd2c-5240-8908-198922051790.jpg,20
Your Money,"4 Standout College Application Essays on Work, Money and Class",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/12/your-money/standout-college-application-essays.html,"I loved the house. I loved the way the windows soaked the house with light, a sort of bleach against any gloom. I loved how I could always find a book or magazine on any flat surface. But the vacuum my mother used wasn't ours. We never paid for cable. The photographs weren't of my family. The carpet I vacuumed I only saw once a week, and the pastel shirts I folded I never wore. The house wasn't mine. My mother was only the cleaning lady, and I helped. My mother and father had come as refugees almost twenty years ago from the country of Moldova. My mother worked numerous odd jobs, but once I was born she decided she needed to do something different. She put an ad in the paper advertising house cleaning, and a couple, both professors, answered. They became her first client, and their house became the bedrock of our sustenance. Economic recessions came and went, but my mother returned every Monday, Friday and occasional Sunday. She spends her days in teal latex gloves, guiding a blue Hoover vacuum over what seems like miles of carpet. All the mirrors she's cleaned could probably stack up to be a minor Philip Johnson skyscraper. This isn't new for her. The vacuums and the gloves might be, but the work isn't. In Moldova, her family grew gherkins and tomatoes. She spent countless hours kneeling in the dirt, growing her vegetables with the care that professors advise their proteges, with kindness and proactivity. Today, the fruits of her labor have been replaced with the suction of her vacuum. The professors' home was a telescope to how the other (more affluent) half lived. They were rarely ever home, so I saw their remnants: the lightly crinkled New York Times sprawled on the kitchen table, the overturned, half-opened books in their overflowing personal library, the TV consistently left on the National Geographic channel. I took these remnants as a celebrity-endorsed path to prosperity. I began to check out books from the school library and started reading the news religiously.

Their home was a sanctuary for my dreams. It was there I, as a glasses-wearing computer nerd, read about a mythical place called Silicon Valley in Bloomberg Businessweek magazines. It was there, as a son of immigrants, that I read about a young senator named Barack Obama, the child of an immigrant, aspiring to be the president of the United States. The life that I saw through their home showed me that an immigrant could succeed in America, too. Work could be done with one's hands and with one's mind. It impressed on me a sort of social capital that I knew could be used in America. The professors left me the elements to their own success, and all my life I've been trying to make my own reaction. Ultimately, the suction of the vacuum is what sustains my family. The squeal of her vacuum reminds me why I have the opportunity to drive my squealing car to school. I am where I am today because my mom put an enormous amount of labor into the formula of the American Dream. It's her blue Hoover vacuums that hold up the framework of my life. Someday, I hope my diploma can hold up the framework of hers.

I grew up in a bed and breakfast, in the sticky thickness of the hospitality industry. And for a very long time I hated it. I was late to my own fifth birthday party in the park because a guest arrived five hours late without apology. Following a weeklong stay in which someone specially requested her room be cleaned twice a day, not once did she leave a tip for housekeeping. Small-business scammers came for a stop at the inn several times. Guests stained sheets, clogged toilets, locked themselves out of their rooms, and then demanded a discount. There exists between service workers and their customers an inherent imbalance of power: We meet sneers with apologies. At the end of their meal, or stay, or drink, we let patrons determine how much effort their server put into their job. For most of my life I believed my parents were intense masochists for devoting their existences to the least thankful business I know: the very business that taught me how to discern imbalances of power. Soon I recognized this stem of injustice in all sorts of everyday interactions. I came to understand how latent racism, sexism, classism and ableism structure our society -- how tipping was only a synonym for ""microaggression."" I became passionate. Sometimes enraged. I stumbled upon nonprofits, foundations, and political campaigns. I canvassed for Senate candidates, phone-banked for grass-roots action groups, served as a board member for the Women's Foundation of Southern Arizona, reviewed grant applications for nonprofits and organized events for the nearby children's hospital. I devoted my time to the raw grit of helping people, and in the process I fell irrevocably in love with a new type of service: public service. At the same time, I worked midnight Black Friday retail shifts and scraped vomit off linoleum. When I brought home my first W-2, I had never seen my parents so proud. The truth, I recently learned, was that not all service is created equal. Seeing guests scream at my parents over a late airport taxi still sickens me even as I spend hours a week as a volunteer. But I was taught all work is noble, especially the work we do for others. Slowly, my mother's gingham apron began to look more like metal armor. I learned how to worship my parents' gift for attentive listening, easily hearing the things guests were incapable of asking for -- not sugar with their tea, but somebody to talk with while they waited for a conference call. I envied their ability to wear the role of self-assured host like a second skin, capable of tolerating any type of cruelty with a smile.

'My Dell hid my privilege and my Mac hid my financial need' The most exciting part was the laptop. My mom grabbed the thick envelope out of my hands and read off the amenities associated with the Tang Scholarship to Phillips Academy: full tuition for all four years, a free summer trip, $20 a week for me to spend on all the Cheetos and nail polish my heart desired, and finally, a free laptop. I had never had a computer of my own before, and to me the prospect symbolized a world of new possibilities. I was the only student from my public middle school I knew to ever go to an elite boarding school, and it felt like being invited into a selective club. My first week at Andover, dazed by its glamour and newness, I fought my way to the financial aid office to pick up the laptop; I sent my mom a photo of me grinning and clutching the cardboard box. Back in my dorm room, I pulled out my prize, a heavy but functional Dell, and marveled at its sleek edges, its astonishing speed. But the love story of my laptop came clamoring to a halt. In the library, as I stumbled to negotiate a space to fit in, I watched my friends each pull out a MacBook. Each was paper-thin and seemingly weightless. And mine, heavy enough to hurt my back and constantly sighing like a tired dog, was distinctly out of place. My laptop, which I had thought was my ticket to the elite world of Andover, actually gave me away as the outsider I was. For a long time, this was the crux of my Andover experience: always an outsider. When I hung out with wealthier friends, I was disoriented by how different their lives were from mine. While they spent summers in Prague or Paris, I spent mine mining the constellation of thrift stores around New Haven. The gap between full-scholarship and full-pay felt insurmountable.

But I also felt like an outsider going to meetings for the full-scholarship affinity group. My parents attended college and grew up wealthier than I did, giving me cultural capital many of my full-scholarship friends never had access to. Moreover, I'm white and could afford occasional concert tickets or sparkly earrings. The laptop, carried by all full-scholarship students and coded with hidden meanings, pivoted my friends' understandings of me. At home, I grew up middle class, then became the privileged prep school girl. But at Andover, suddenly, I was poor. Trying to reconcile these conflicting identities, I realized how complex and mutable class is. My class is connected to my parents' income, but it's also rooted in cultural knowledge and objects that are charged with greater meaning. Which brings me back to the laptop: in the middle of my senior fall, my exhausted Dell broke and I couldn't afford another. When I managed to borrow a slim Mac from my school, I felt the walls around me reorient. I hoped that now I wouldn't have to think about the electric web of privilege and power every time I sent an email. Instead, I felt a new anxiety: I worried when I sat in the magnificent dining hall with my beautiful computer that I had lost an important part of my identity. When I started at Andover, these constant dueling tensions felt like a trap: like I would never be comfortable anywhere. (The school sensed it too, and all full-financial aid students now receive MacBooks.) But maybe it's the opposite of a trap. Maybe I'm culturally ambidextrous, as comfortable introducing a speaker on the stage of Andover's century-old chapel as getting my nose pierced in a tattoo parlor in New Haven. My hyperawareness of how my Dell hid my privilege and how my Mac hid my financial need pushed me to be aware of what complicated stories were hiding behind my classmates' seemingly simple facades. I am a full-scholarship student who benefits from cultural, socioeconomic and racial privilege: my story isn't easy, but it's still mine.

I live between a suburban land of plenty and a rural land of scarcity, where endless skies and pallid grass merge with apartment complexes and outdoor malls. I balance on the edge of drought. In the summers, when the rain doesn't come, my father's truck kicks dust into the air. A layer of earthy powder settles over the wildflowers and the grass. The stale ground sparks ferocious wildfires. Smoke soars into the air like a flare from a boat lost at sea. Everyone prays for rain. We fear that each drop of water is the last. We fear an invasion of the desert that stretches around Phoenix. We fear a heat that shrivels the trees, turns them to cactuses. I exist at the epicenter of political discourse. Fierce liberalism swells against staunch conservatism in the hallways of my high school and on the streets of the downtown. When the air is warm, the shops and restaurants open their doors. Professionals in suits mingle with musicians and artists sporting dreadlocks and ripped jeans. Together, they lament the drought, marvel at the brevity of the ski season. I live on the edge of an urban and rural existence. At my mother's house, we ride bikes down paved streets. We play catch with the neighbor kids. We wage war with water guns. At my father's house, we haul water. We feed the horses and chickens. We chase the fox away from the chicken coop. We watch deer grazing, not ten yards away. We turn the soil in the garden. When the rain and the soil and the sun and the plants give birth to fruit, we eat it straight from the vines. Traditional Navajo weaving and prints of Picasso's paintings adorn the walls of both homes. I straddle the innocence of my youth and the mystery of my adult life. That, too, is a precipice. I know I must leap into adulthood and leave the balancing act of Flagstaff life behind. Still, I belong at the place where opposites merge in a lumpy heap of beautiful contradictions. I crave the experiences only found at the edge. As I dive into adulthood, into college, I hope that I can find a new place that fosters diversity in all its forms, a new edge upon which I can learn to balance.","Each year, we issue a call to high school seniors who dare to address money, work or social class in their college application essays.

Movies,'Ms. Purple' Review: The Ties That Bind (and Sometimes Strangle),https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/12/movies/ms-purple-review.html,"Following two deeply damaged siblings, each lacking a place in the world, Justin Chon's ""Ms. Purple"" seems named not for a character, but for a state of mind that's been a long time brewing.

Purple is also the color of the traditional South Korean dress obediently worn one evening by Kasie (Tiffany Chu), 23, at the insistence of her rich, entitled boyfriend (Tony Kim). But in the United States, where the film takes place, purple vividly signifies daring and defiance, independence and strength. That demands a personality to match, and Kasie is a woman controlled by the demands of men. To her fond-enough boyfriend, she's property, a sex partner and a compliant plus-one. To the boozed-up businessmen at the high-end karaoke bar where she works as a hostess, she's a body to be fondled and shared and sometimes drugged. And to her dying father (James Kang), lying comatose in her childhood home, she's a caregiver whose devotion is necessarily unrequited.

When the aide tending to her father abruptly leaves, Kasie is forced to contact her estranged brother, Carey (Teddy Lee), for help.

Economy,"Home Prices Slid in December in Most U.S. Cities, Index Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/23/business/economy/23housing.html,"Real estate prices slid in just about every part of the country in December, pushing a housing market that once seemed to be rebounding nearly back to its lowest level since the crash began. At this dismal point, some economists and analysts say that the damage has been done, and there is nowhere to go but up. Many others argue that the market has still not finished falling. And then there are those who maintain that, possibly, things are about to get a whole lot worse. Robert J. Shiller, the Yale economist who is the author of ""Irrational Exuberance"" and who helped develop the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, put himself in this last group. Mr. Shiller said in a conference call on Tuesday that he saw ""a substantial risk"" of the market falling another 15, 20 or even 25 percent. The 20-city Case-Shiller composite is already off 31.2 percent from its peak, according to data released Tuesday. Average home prices in Atlanta, Cleveland, Las Vegas and Detroit are below the levels of 11 years ago. A drop the size that Mr. Shiller says he thinks could happen would put Chicago, Dallas, Charlotte and Minneapolis there, too. It would create a lost decade for housing in much of the country even before the effects of inflation.

Mr. Shiller said several political trends indicated a dreary future, including the uncertainty over the mortgage holding companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and proposals to reduce the mortgage tax deduction. Mr. Shiller's colleague, the economist Karl E. Case, a professor emeritus of economics at Wellesley College, says he does not think the outlook is so dire. He said in the conference call on Tuesday that he thought the housing market was at ""a rocky bottom with a down trend.""

The S.& P./Case-Shiller index of 20 large metropolitan areas fell 1 percent in December from November, although the drop was just 0.4 percent when the data was adjusted for seasonal variations. Eleven cities in the index posted their lowest levels in December since home price peaks in 2006 and 2007, up from nine cities in November. Phoenix and New York joined a list that includes Atlanta, Chicago and Seattle. The only city in the index that posted a monthly gain on an unadjusted basis was Washington. Five cities posted a gain on an adjusted basis.

One data point that favored Mr. Case's optimism: The adjusted declines in December and November were about half the drops in the previous two months, indicating the slide might be slowing. Most analysts seem to fall between Mr. Shiller and Mr. Case in their forecasts. ""Even though affordability is exceptionally high and housing is incredibly cheap, the double-dip in house prices that began last year will continue throughout this year,"" Capital Economics, a consulting firm, said Tuesday. Their estimate was that prices would drop another 5 percent unless a ""vicious circle"" of falling prices and rising foreclosures developed, in which case prices would be worse. Also released Tuesday was the Case-Shiller quarterly index that covers all homes in the country. It showed prices fell 3.9 percent in the fourth quarter and 4.1 percent for all of 2010. The Case-Shiller index is a three-month moving average, which means it changes slowly. It is now less than 3 percent above the low recorded in the spring of 2009, when there was widespread hope that the market was starting to recover. To accelerate the process, the Obama administration offered a carrot for new buyers: a tax credit. The credit did its job, enticing hundreds of thousands of buyers to accelerate their purchases in the fall of 2009 and the spring of 2010. But the credit did not lay the groundwork for a permanent rebound. ""Every place is pretty much getting hit a second time for essentially the same reasons,"" said Andrew LePage, an analyst with DataQuick Information Systems. ""Slow economic recovery, little job growth, still-tight credit, no more government stimulus, a pervasive and gnawing sense that prices could fall more, too few people getting jobs and too many worrying about losing the one they have.""

Amid all this gloom, one group thinks the situation is much better than generally portrayed: the National Association of Realtors. Its data shows the median existing single-family home price rose in 78 out of 152 metropolitan statistical areas in the fourth quarter of 2010 from the fourth quarter of 2009, including 10 with double-digit increases. But even as the group asserts that the market's decline has been overstated, it is being accused of having bad numbers of its own. The blog Calculated Risk wrote last month that the real estate group was planning major downward revisions to the last three years of house sales data. CoreLogic, a data company, said last week that it estimated 2010 home sales at 3.6 million, much less than the 4.9 million the National Association of Realtors was claiming. If accurate, the CoreLogic numbers would indicate a market even more troubled than is generally assumed. Against this welter of conflicting claims and dark predictions, many would-be sellers are opting out until that distant moment when they can get what they think they deserve. Some are renting their home after moving to new quarters; others are simply turning down that new job and staying put. This can work to the advantage of those who plunge ahead. Jordan and Caitlin Van Horn bought their house in the fashionable Seattle neighborhood of Ballard three years ago. Ever since then, the market has slumped. The couple is moving to Alabama and feared the worst when they put their home on the market. They were pleasantly surprised. Their four-bedroom house fetched $545,000 after less than a week, only 5 percent less than they paid. ""The lack of inventory really worked to our advantage,"" said Mr. Van Horn, a co-developer of a bookkeeping system for small businesses. ""We feel thankful for the way things turned out.""",The Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller price index fell to nearly its lowest level since the housing crash began.,00c22e08-6475-5789-ac21-491ae059131d,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/02/23/business/economy/23housing-span/23housing-span-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=66607fffd3a43253cb9d3a1ef878a6a1deb1536229a768bbcc344c223fb6ec14&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,New York and 10 other cities posted new Case-Shiller index lows in December 2010.,00c22e08-6475-5789-ac21-491ae059131d,N24News/imgs/00c22e08-6475-5789-ac21-491ae059131d.jpg,8
Art & Design,"This Time, the Muppets Take Queens",https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/19/arts/design/jim-henson-muppets-puppeteer-museum-of-moving-image.html,"It's time to play the music! It's time to light the lights! Four years after the family of Jim Henson donated much of his puppeteer archive to the Museum of the Moving Image in Queens -- a move announced by then-mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who planted a smooch on Miss Piggy -- the work goes on permanent display this weekend, googly eyes and all. The project ran several years behind schedule, as the museum expanded its gallery space (with the help of city funding) and restored the hand-held creatures (with the help of a crowdfunding campaign that blew past financing goals). Now, at last, the fur is all in place.

""The Jim Henson Exhibition"" includes nearly four-dozen puppets, plus hundreds of sketches, videos and props from ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show,"" early commercials, misfired experiments and cult films of the 1980s. Another substantial chunk of Henson's archive is at the new Center for Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, which Henson supported during his lifetime, though the Museum of the Moving Image has a home-court advantage: Henson's workshop is nearby in Long Island City, while Sesame Street itself lies around the block at Kaufman Astoria Studios. In this initial period you'll need to get a timed ticket to meet the Muppets, which seems sensible given the show's narrow, winding galleries; you'll want to reserve your family's spots now.

Children will no doubt thrill to see Big Bird and Kermit, but this exhibition -- like many of Henson's shows -- is mainly for adults, concerned with the craft of puppetry and the expansion of broadcast media as much as with lovable frogs and monsters. Henson, born in Greenville, Miss., in 1936, had an early gift for landscape drawing, but he cottoned on quickly to the potentials of a new medium -- and to the branding opportunities that the medium would allow. In 1950 he convinced his parents to buy a TV set, and before he was out of his teens Henson had created ""Sam and Friends,"" a puppet show that ran in five-minute segments on a local Washington station.

With Jane Nebel, later his wife and muse, Henson performed what were essentially early music videos: lip-synced renditions of ""That Old Black Magic"" or ""I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face,"" interwoven with wacky words from our sponsor. Sam, a human puppet, had a rigid face more appropriate for puppet theater. But another, floppier puppet who made his debut in 1955 -- named Kermit, who was not yet a frog but a lizardlike creature made from an old coat belonging to Jim's mother -- could produce animated facial expressions that made him perfect for the close-up shots of a TV camera. In one of the few interactive sections of this show, you can don a puppet on your right hand and try to make it lip-sync one of these early variety performances in front of a camera. (I scored pretty low on hand-eye coordination; my clip looked like a Muppet hostage video.)

Henson was a young man in a young medium, and both ""Sesame Street"" and ""The Muppet Show"" would later bear the patent legacy of early television -- above all the variety show, with its swift succession of skits and songs. His puppets were ideal guests for variety hosts in those early years; one of them, Rowlf the Dog, appeared on ""The Jimmy Dean Show"" between 1963 and 1966. At the same time, Henson was producing rapid-fire, often mischievous commercials. Eight-second spots for supermarket coffee featured Wilkins, a smiley cylinder, and Wontkins, a grumpy cone who got bopped on the head or set on fire. Instant chow mein was hawked by a red and pink dragon, one of Henson's earliest full-body characters, who looks like a carnivalesque prototype for Big Bird.

Henson was a voice actor as much as a puppeteer, and with ""Sesame Street,"" whose first episode aired in 1969, you can fully see the brilliance of Henson's comic timing -- and the more frenetic gifts of Frank Oz, the Laurel to Henson's Hardy. They pulled off some of the great double acts, whether as strait-laced Bert and wisecracking Ernie, or as antic Grover and flummoxed Kermit, now officially a frog. (Henson's successor as Kermit, the puppeteer Steve Whitmire, was fired this month, after 27 years, in a dispute with Disney, which bought the Muppets in 2004.)

Later Mr. Oz would voice a new character, Miss Piggy, who grew from a one-off character on late-night TV to the star of ""The Muppet Show,"" the music-hall-style show that Henson produced in Britain in 1976 after American executives passed. Miss Piggy is here in a bridal gown, and the other full-scale puppets include Big Bird, Cookie Monster, Elmo, Prairie Dawn, the Swedish chef and several stars of ""Fraggle Rock."" There is a prototype of the ""Anything Muppet,"" the fat blue bit player of ""Sesame Street"" whom visitors can affix with any number of eyes, noses, wigs and mustaches. You also get to know my all-time heroes Statler and Waldorf, the professional haters in the ""Muppet Show"" balcony who remind us that even we critics can deliver a punch line. (""Do you believe in life after death?"" ""Every time I leave this theater!"")

Henson initially demurred when he was asked to join what became ""Sesame Street,"" and he was always wary of seeing puppetry as only children's entertainment. A fascinating gallery at the Museum of the Moving Image is devoted to Henson's experimental work of the 1960s, which included live-action shorts, peace-and-love documentaries, and designs for a psychedelic nightclub that would have featured kaleidoscopic projections. His two films from the 1980s, ""The Dark Crystal"" and ""Labyrinth,"" skew darker and more fatalistic. But though the puppets his studio designed could inspire awe in cinematic settings, as a performer and writer Henson always did best with the intimacy and rapidity of television.

He died young, succumbing at 53 to a bacterial infection. In the years since his death in 1990 his studio, known as the Creature Shop, has produced increasingly sophisticated animatronic characters, notably for the television show ""Dinosaurs"" (1991-1994), as well as digital characters for the children's show ""Sid the Science Kid."" But there is something about the simplicity of the Muppets -- low-tech dummies in a young broadcast medium -- that brought out a new kind of virtuosity from Henson and his team, who threw so much into their performances that whole generations became their intimate friends.","In ""The Jim Henson Exhibition"" at the Museum of the Moving Image, the man behind the Muppets and other puppets is the star of the show.",3e2fa2bc-ddf8-5f0e-9283-00e0058584f7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/21/arts/21HENSON1/21HENSON1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=500&w=956&s=4743a89b52d5ffcc17e7f6e0f1de313c667c53b561b6d051b55cff7974c8e23f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Kermit the Frog sits next to Jim Henson's headset at ""The Jim Henson Exhibition,"" opening Saturday at the Museum of the Moving Image.",3e2fa2bc-ddf8-5f0e-9283-00e0058584f7,N24News/imgs/3e2fa2bc-ddf8-5f0e-9283-00e0058584f7.jpg,14
Music,Daniel Johnston Dies; Gifted and Enigmatic Songwriter Was 58,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/11/arts/music/daniel-johnston-dead.html,"Daniel Johnston, a singer-songwriter and visual artist whose childlike, haunted songs brought him acclaim as one of America's most gifted outsider voices, was found dead on Wednesday morning at his home in Waller, Tex., outside Houston. He was 58. His brother and manager, Dick, said in an interview that Mr. Johnston had probably died overnight. He did not specify the cause. Mr. Johnston had been released from a hospital on Tuesday after being treated for kidney problems. ""He was still productive, writing songs and drawing, and was just annoyed by his health more than anything,"" his brother said. ""It was just one thing after another.""

In a career filled with stops and starts, Mr. Johnston became something of a man-child celebrity of the artistic underground, earning the admiration of rock stars like Kurt Cobain and Tom Waits as well as comparisons to William Blake. His cartoon drawings -- rendered in Magic Marker and frequently inspired by characters like Casper the Friendly Ghost -- were included in the Whitney Biennial exhibition in 2006 at the Whitney Museum of American Art.

As news of his death spread, Mr. Johnston was mourned online by creators across mediums and generations, among them Beck, the director Judd Apatow and John Darnielle of the literary-minded indie band the Mountain Goats. The producer Jack Antonoff praised the way Mr. Johnston had ""shared fearlessly."" Mr. Johnston was born on Jan. 22, 1961, in Sacramento, the youngest of five children in what he described as a Christian fundamentalist household. At a young age he moved with his family to West Virginia, but by the early 1980s he had relocated to Austin, Tex., a center of underground rock, where he handed out homemade cassettes to friends and customers while working at a McDonald's. According to his website, those tapes were recorded on a $59 Sanyo boombox.

He quickly gained the notice of fellow musicians and the music press with songs, like ""Speeding Motorcycle"" and ""Don't Play Cards With Satan,"" that had a poignant clarity yet showed glimpses of a fractured mind. He became almost as well known for the strange, cartoonish art that decorated the tapes. One, ""Hi, How Are You,"" featured a froglike alien; the image became his signature.

With a boyish voice and a gift for pure melody -- his biggest inspiration was the Beatles -- Mr. Johnston sang candidly and sometimes disturbingly about his demons. ""Despair came knocking at my door, and I let her in for a while,"" he sang on ""Despair Came Knocking,"" from ""Hi, How Are You."" ""She sat on the couch and began smoking. She said nothing."" Climbing the rungs of the indie-rock world, Mr. Johnston was featured on MTV in 1985, and three years later went to New York, where he mixed with the bands Sonic Youth and Galaxie 500 but ended up in Bellevue Hospital after he assaulted Sonic Youth's drummer, Steve Shelley. (On his release, Mr. Johnston went straight to CBGB to perform.) At the same time, Mr. Johnston's songs were becoming indie-rock standards. ""Speeding Motorcycle,"" capturing the thrill and fear of passion -- ""Speeding motorcycle, don't you drive recklessly/Speeding motorcycle of my heart"" -- was covered by Yo La Tengo, the Pastels, Mary Lou Lord and others.

In 1991, Mr. Johnston made a joint album with Jad Fair of the band Half Japanese, who had cultivated a similar reputation as an eccentric. But as the rock magazine Trouser Press noted in a record guide, Mr. Fair ""seems about as offbeat as an insurance salesman"" in comparison to Mr. Johnston, who on one track muttered ""Poor you, no one understands you"" in a warped, ghostlike voice. In the music industry's alternative-rock gold rush of the 1990s, Mr. Johnston was briefly signed to Atlantic Records. But his sole major-label album, ""Fun,"" released in 1994, was a flop, and the label dropped him. As Mr. Johnston's mental problems mounted -- he suffered from manic depression and schizophrenia -- he largely withdrew from performing and remained at his family home. In addition to his brother, he is survived by three sisters, Margy Johnston, Sally Reid and Cindy Brewer.

But when Mr. Johnston was chosen for the 2006 edition of the prestigious Whitney Biennial, he was completely unaware of his selection. When asked whether he would travel to New York to see his work in the show, he told The New York Times: ""I'm not in any condition to go overseas. It would wipe me out ."" In recent years, Mr. Johnston worked sporadically on a new album, based on recordings from the 1990s and early 2000s, which he wanted to call ""If."" But according to an account in New York magazine, the project languished amid disagreements between Brian Beattie, the producer, and Dick Johnston and others involved in Mr. Johnston's management. On Wednesday, Mr. Beattie said that the album was complete and that he hoped it would be released soon. Still, Mr. Johnston remained dedicated to his art, planning his 2017 tour despite failing health. ""I can't stop writing,"" he said in an interview with The Times. ""If I did stop, there could be nothing. Maybe everything would stop. So I won't stop. I've got to keep it going.""",He was admired by Kurt Cobain and Tom Waits and earned comparisons to William Blake. But his career was cut short by his struggles with mental illness.,4f4dac6d-f5f6-55a4-bd34-157ed8adae77,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/13/obituaries/11Johnston3/11Johnston3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=549&w=1050&s=7593afc6258561c7d873aa5b3c382bc5846c2b3658101271b7cb74c0f0e912a1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Mr. Johnston at his Texas home in 2006.

When audiences are introduced to the title character of ""Harriet,"" a biographical drama directed by Kasi Lemmons, Harriet Tubman isn't yet called Harriet Tubman; she's Minty Ross, an enslaved woman in 1840s Maryland. The film tracks Minty's transformation into Harriet -- a name Ross chooses after escaping enslavement -- and then Harriet's transformation into an icon through her leadership in the underground railroad. Cynthia Erivo plays Tubman, alongside a cast that includes Leslie Odom Jr. and Janelle Monae as antislavery activists. The result, A.O. Scott wrote in his review for The New York Times, is a ""rousing and powerful drama, respectful of both the historical record and the cravings of modern audiences.""

An extravagant revival staged by the Roundabout Theatre Company in 2016, this version of the show, directed by Scott Ellis, preserves the Broadway spectacle of the original, giving its cast -- which also includes the comic actress Jane Krakowski -- many opportunities for classic, old-fashioned showmanship.

Opinion,Trump Thinks He Knows Better Than the Doctors About Coronavirus,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/24/opinion/trump-coronavirus-economy.html,"First, President Trump ignored the coronavirus, dismissing its threat to the public. Then briefly he took it somewhat seriously. He gave an address from the Oval Office, followed by one of the more sober-minded news conferences of his administration. A day later, he was back to his usual antics, attacking the press, amplifying propagandists and spreading misinformation. He has even promised a miracle cure. Now, as it becomes clear that this is not a momentary crisis -- that the economy may have to come to a standstill to keep the disease from overwhelming the country -- Trump appears ready to quit altogether, even if it costs thousands upon thousands of American lives. ""WE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF,"" the president said (or screamed) on Twitter late Sunday night. ""AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!"" Subsequent reporting from Jonathan Swan of Axios confirmed that the administration is looking to relax guidelines for public gatherings, in order to bring the economy back online: ""Amid dire predictions for jobs and the economy, the White House is beginning to send signals that there's light at the end of the tunnel -- that the squeeze from nationwide social distancing won't be endless.""

If the United States had the strict testing regime of South Korea or Taiwan -- if it knew the full extent of the outbreak and had the resources to selectively quarantine the sick and the contagious -- then you could imagine a return to normalcy in the next month or so, as most people began to go back to work and the vulnerable stayed home. But that is an unlikely, best- case scenario, more dream world than reality.

What is actually happening is that we don't know how many Americans are sick or how many are asymptomatic. We aren't quite flying blind, but without more tests we can't see very clearly either. What we do know is that we have a fast-growing caseload that implies that there are many more infections than what's in the official numbers so far. To relax restrictions in this environment is to guarantee greater spread of the disease and higher death tolls With a fatality rate of 1 percent, we can expect nearly 1 million deaths if 30 percent of Americans come down with the virus. Of course, the fatality rate isn't fixed. Among other things, it depends on the capacity of the health system. If local hospitals aren't able to handle a flood of coronavirus patients -- if they can't treat everyone -- then the fatality rate will go up. In Italy, where hospitals are straining to treat the sick, the fatality rate among confirmed cases is closer to 9 percent. The economy will collapse under an extended social lockdown. It will also collapse in the face of a million or more coronavirus deaths, as people refuse to work or spend time in public spaces lest they risk infection. Both choices are bad, but one will save lives while the other will sacrifice them for the sake of illusory gains. That's why the administration's own experts have urged the White House to continue social distancing and other protective measures.

But neither Trump nor many of his allies appear to care that much about the human toll. Or at least they've convinced themselves that an extended lockdown is more harmful than anything the virus can do. Trump, The Washington Post reports, is ""fixated on the plummeting stock market, is chafing at the idea of the country remaining closed until the summer and growing tired of talking only about the coronavirus."" Key officials within the administration -- like Steven Mnuchin, the secretary of the Treasury -- are pushing the president to get the economy back on track. ""The president is right. The cure can't be worse than the disease,"" Larry Kudlow, director of the White House National Economic Council, said on Fox News on Monday. ""And we're going to have to make some difficult trade-offs."" I suppose it is possible that when Trump and Kudlow say this, they are thinking of service employees and blue-collar workers, of people who live from paycheck to paycheck. But their mutual fixation on the stock market -- Trump's shift from apathy to attention came in the wake of a breathtaking sell-off -- makes this unlikely. The ""trade-off"" here isn't lives for prosperity -- again, coronavirus will dampen economic activity with or without social distancing -- it's lives for shareholder value. There's another issue as well. The only way to sustain an economy in lockdown is unconditional government support for individuals, families and communities. It's social democracy, if only for a while. And that amount of redistribution -- from top to bottom, from creditors to debtors -- is unacceptable to the president and his allies. Remember that the Trump administration is still trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act and end food assistance for 700,000 Americans. Marxists have a turn of phrase that dates back to the late 19th century: ""Socialism or barbarism."" It comes from the German journalist and philosopher Karl Kautsky, who in 1892 wrote, ""As things stand today capitalist civilization cannot continue; we must either move forward into socialism or fall back into barbarism."" Two decades later, in a 1915 pamphlet, ""The Crisis in German Social Democracy,"" the Polish revolutionary Rosa Luxemburg recapitulated the idea, attributing it to Karl Marx's lifelong friend and collaborator Friedrich Engels. ""Bourgeois society stands at the crossroads,"" she wrote while a generation of European men marched to their doom in the First World War, ""either transition to socialism or regression into barbarism."" You don't have to be a revolutionary socialist to understand the sentiment. In the face of disaster, the only path forward is solidarity and mutual concern. Reject it, and all that's left is a cold and selfish disregard for human life. ""America will again -- and soon -- be open for business,"" the president said on Monday. ""Very soon, a lot sooner than three or four months that somebody was suggesting. A lot sooner."" In other words, Trump will sacrifice Americans to coronavirus if it will save the market and his prospects for re-election. Which is to say that given the choice between solidarity and barbarism, Trump will choose barbarism. We'll see, in November, if the rest of the country follows suit.

Music,What Does Alternative Rock Radio Sound Like in the Age of Spotify?,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/arts/music/rock-radio.html,"At ALT 92.3 FM, the New York rock radio station where Christine Malovetz is a midday host and assistant program director, ""rock"" is a slippery term.





What Does Alternative Rock Radio Sound Like in the Age of Spotify?

It was still light out, early on a weekday evening this summer, when dozens of contest winners, radio station employees and advertisers packed a small Manhattan music hall for what was not exactly a display of rock 'n' roll bacchanalia. Free pizza was scattered about and people waited patiently as the station hosting the event -- ALT 92.3 (WNYL-FM), New York City's only major contemporary rock station -- was piped in at a respectable volume. Songs by Red Hot Chili Peppers, the All-American Rejects and 311, each more than a decade old, played to little notice. But a cheer of recognition bubbled up for ""Quarter Past Midnight"" by the British group Bastille, which was scheduled to take the stage to celebrate its recent album release with an intimate performance. After three minutes of glossy, post-Coldplay pop-rock, the crowd once again quieted for ""Somebody That I Used to Know,"" the 2011 No. 1 hit by Gotye, as it awaited the four men of Bastille in the flesh.

""We don't even say the word 'rock' on the radio station -- we're New York's new alternative,"" said Mike Kaplan, the ALT 92.3 program director and format captain for alternative across Entercom, the station's parent company, in an earlier interview. ""I don't think there's a big win in using the word rock today,"" he added. ""The raw, guitar-rock sound is really -- I don't want to say it's done, but ..."" He trailed off. ""It's present, but it's morphed and mixed with other instrumentation. Does anyone really go to Guitar Center anymore and pick up the guitar?"" The overlapping quagmires currently facing alternative rock radio -- how much new music should it play, what should it sound like and who is it for? -- are particularly tricky in New York, which has long been led and defined by its rap, Latin and pop stations. The alternative format, also referred to in the industry as modern rock, grew out of the underground radio of the 1970s, and rode breakout bands like R.E.M., Pixies and the Cure to the Nirvana explosion of the early 1990s, when previously niche acts from punk traditions stormed the mainstream. In the aftermath, through the rap-rock of the new millennium and the dance-pop and Top 40 dominance of the mid-2000s, rock stations that didn't rely on oldies have been the subject of much hand-wringing regarding their sonic allegiances and commercial prospects.

At 92.3, once the home of Howard Stern ( and formerly known as K-ROCK) , alternative has been an on-and-off proposition since 1996; most recently, under different ownership, the station spent three years playing dance music amid the EDM boom. That changed in late 2017 -- a format flip marked by the playing of ""My Hero"" by Foo Fighters -- with the merger of CBS Radio, which ran the station, and Entercom, a national conglomerate and iHeartRadio competitor that saw a hole in the market. ""Bringing alternative back to New York was a huge deal,"" said Susan Larkin, Entercom's regional president and market manager for New York. She described the station's ideal listener as ""early 30s -- they're in an acquisition stage of their lives, just really starting to get brand loyalty and they have decent jobs,"" adding: ""Who better to talk to, as an advertiser?""

ALT 92.3, one of 13 alternative stations under the Entercom umbrella, has built a steady listenership in its second full year, averaging an audience of about 1.7 million a week, according to Nielsen -- below the 2.5 million listeners averaged by the Latin station La Mega 97.9 FM or the 2.2 million for the urban station Power 105.1 FM, but on par with the company's storied alternative channel KROQ-FM 106.7 in Los Angeles. ALT has also focused on building local community with live events, like exclusive performances by Vampire Weekend and Twenty One Pilots in its heavily mural-covered offices, and its inaugural ""Not So Silent Night"" holiday arena concert, which will continue this year. Kaplan, a Chris Hayes type with black-framed glasses, acknowledged that finding a market for rock in New York ""has been difficult,"" pointing to ""the ethnicity of New York, the makeup -- the majority of our listeners are Caucasian,"" he said. He described his philosophy for reaching a target demographic of 25 to 34 -year-olds as ""playing hits -- the familiar music. People say they want new -- and they do, and we do give it to them in the right dose."" But, Kaplan added, the station can't ""push too much to try to make something that's not there there.""

""If there's anything polarizing that I see in the music, it's a no-go,"" he said, scrolling through the station's music database. Commercial radio has always been a fundamentally conservative medium, dedicated to avoiding any kind of jolt that would lead a listener to change the channel, but that can sometimes put alternative stations at odds with the ethos of alternative music, especially given the rapidly evolving choices available on streaming services and satellite radio. Steve Blatter, the head of music programming at Sirius XM, said, ""Over the last five-plus years now, depending on how you measure popularity, alternative rock has seen a decline."" But he noted that his company's three flagship channels dedicated to contemporary rock -- Alt Nation for alternative, Octane for heavier alternative and XMU for indie rock akin to college radio -- have maintained a large, consistent audience by dedicating themselves to discovery, playing new music up to 75 percent of the time. ""Compare that to an alternative rock channel in FM, and you probably in most cases will see the reverse,"" he said.

""I wish there were more females in this audience,"" Kaplan said. ""There happens to be men."" For ALT 92.3, being on the cutting edge might not mean breaking an artist before Spotify or YouTube, which remains all but impossible for a more traditional medium, but catching alternative-enough acts, like Maeson or the next Bastille, before they transition to the mainstream. ""Songs cross over all the time from here to pop, and I like that,"" Kaplan said, noting that heavier, darker sounds had moved away in favor of ""the poppier elements."" ""We're redefining what the word alternative means, especially for New York City,"" he said. ""But we need to find what's next, and have men and women both agree.""","At ALT 92.3 FM, where they don't say ""rock,"" it's a mix of millennial oldies and newer, pop-leaning and electronic folk from bands like Bastille and Smith & Thell.",e46472f5-114d-53cd-a89a-6f24cf4d73ec,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/19/arts/18rockradio-2/18rockradio-2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2078ef5a3e55c7caa11d17d5c2b563760a7256a4b1484b7b2facf1e5777e5a1d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"At 92.3, alternative has been an on-and-off proposition since 1996.",e46472f5-114d-53cd-a89a-6f24cf4d73ec,N24News/imgs/e46472f5-114d-53cd-a89a-6f24cf4d73ec.jpg,12
Books,"Bruce Jay Friedman, 90, Author With a Darkly Comic Worldview, Dies",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/03/books/bruce-jay-friedman-dead.html,"Bruce Jay Friedman, whose early novels, short stories and plays were pioneering examples of modern American black humor, making dark but giggle-inducing sport of the deep, if not pathological, insecurities of his white, male, middle-class and often Jewish protagonists, died on Wednesday at his home in Brooklyn. He was 90. His son Josh said that the cause had not been determined, but that his father had had neuropathy. Mr. Friedman, who also wrote the screenplays for the hit film comedies ""Stir Crazy"" and ""Splash,"" was an unusual case in American letters: an essentially comic writer whose work skipped back and forth between literature and pop culture and who, after an early decade of literary stardom, seemed almost to vanish in plain sight. Like his contemporaries Joseph Heller, Stanley Elkin and Thomas Pynchon, he wrote what came to be called black humor, largely because of an anthology by that name that he edited in 1965. His first two novels, ""Stern"" (1962) and the best-selling ""A Mother's Kisses"" (1964) -- tales of New York Jews exploring an America outside the five boroughs -- and his first play, the 1967 Off Broadway hit ""Scuba Duba,"" a sendup of race relations that is set in motion when a Jewish man fears his wife is having an affair with a black spear fisherman, made him widely celebrated. The New York Times Magazine in 1968 declared Mr. Friedman ""The Hottest Writer of the Year.""

A deadpan prose stylist with a keen ear for the absurdly self-involved dialogue that emanates from neurosis, Mr. Friedman was, at his best, a savage social satirist. He took advantage of the social upheaval he lived through in the 1960s and '70s to write about race and gender relations from the suddenly uncertain perspective of men like, well, himself, gleefully tweaking the white male psyche's tenderest spots. In ""Black Angels,"" a short story often cited as emblematic of his early and most literary work, the main character, Stefano, is a white man left alone, despairing and struggling to keep up the maintenance on his house after his wife takes their young child and runs off with another man, ""an assistant director of daytime TV"" (a typically arch Friedmanesque detail). He finds salvation in the form of a team of black yard workers, led by a man named Cotten, who labor for bargain prices. The story, which takes place almost entirely in Stefano's fevered and guilt-ridden mind, ends when he invites Cotten in for a beer, begins confessing his problems and places the gardener in the role of a shrink -- a service, Cotten says, for which he charges $400 an hour. In his novel ""Stern,"" an Air Force veteran moves his family from the city to the suburbs, where a brief anti-Semitic and sexually charged encounter between his wife and a neighbor unleashes a virulent stream of neuroses.

""In the Air Force, Stern, recently married and swiftly packing on hip fat, felt isolated, a nonflying officer in a flying service, at a time when jets were coming in and there was no escaping them,"" Mr. Friedman wrote. ""The air,"" he continued, ""was full of strange new jet sounds and the ground reverberated with the throb of them. Somehow Stern connected his nonflying status with his Jewishness, as though flying were a golden, crew-cut, gentile thing while Jewishness was a cautious and scholarly quality that crept into engines and prevented planes from lurching off the ground with recklessness."" ""Stern"" was almost universally praised as a shrewd and humorous take on the psychic terrors of seemingly serene suburbia. ""A Mother's Kisses"" could be thought of as something of a prequel, the story of a 17-year-old Brooklyn boy whose bulldozing mother arranges his admission to an agricultural college in Kansas and then follows him out there. Mr. Friedman's novel ""A Mother's Kisses"" (1964) was a best seller and introduced readers to a character one critic called ""the most unforgettable mother since Medea."" ""A Mother's Kisses"" was adapted into a stage musical that nearly made it to Broadway (it closed out of town). It introduced readers not only to Joseph, Mr. Friedman's portrait of a lonely, perplexed Jew as a young man, but also to the indomitable Meg, a woman whom Haskel Frankel, writing in The New York Times Book Review and sparing no hyperbole, called ""the most unforgettable mother since Medea."" Mr. Friedman followed up with two novels that changed milieus, imbuing both an urban detective (in ""The Dick,"" 1970) and a cocaine-addled screenwriter (""About Harry Towns,"" 1974) with the signature qualities of bafflement and self-questioning. And he continued to write short stories, including ""A Change of Plan,"" a comic tale about brutal selfishness in which a young man goes on a Florida honeymoon, meets another woman at the hotel pool and ditches his new wife for her. Adapted by Mr. Simon, the story became, as the women's movement was taking hold in 1972, a highly provocative film, ""The Heartbreak Kid,"" starring Mr. Grodin, Cybill Shepherd and Jeannie Berlin, whose mother, Elaine May, directed. (A 2007 remake, starring Ben Stiller, was directed by Bobby and Peter Farrelly.)

""It hit some kind of chord,"" Mr. Friedman said to a Key West, Fla., audience in 2005 after reading the story aloud. ""I guess maybe it's not unusual when people are walking down the aisle for an instant to flash on the possibility that maybe they're making a mistake. Maybe there's someone else. I know it happened to me. ""People ask where do stories come from,"" he continued. ""Well, they come from a lot of places. Very often it's your life, and then you extrapolate from a personal experience. In my case, yeah, OK, I got married, went down to Florida, we were exhausted, my wife fell asleep, I went down to the pool and I saw a very pretty girl. And I said, 'Oh, God.' And I did tell her I was a little married, and she just splashed some water at me. That pretty much ended it. I went back into the marriage, had three children. And then got divorced. ""But that's how a story will happen. You have a fragment of an experience and ask yourself, 'What if?'"" Bruce Jay Friedman was born on April 26, 1930, and grew up, along with his sister, Dollie, in a three-room apartment in the Bronx, much like the crowded one in Brooklyn he described in ""A Mother's Kisses."" His father, Irving, worked for a women's apparel company; his mother, Molly, a confident woman with a feisty patter and a devoted theatergoer who was described by a friend of Bruce's as ""someone looking like a middle-aged Jewish Rita Hayworth,"" was evidently the model for Meg. After graduating from DeWitt Clinton High School and, like Joseph, failing to get into Columbia University, he went to the University of Missouri, where he studied journalism. He spent two years in the Air Force, during which he wrote for a military publication called Air Training. Shortly after returning to the Bronx, Mr. Friedman sold his first short story, ""Wonderful Golden Rule Days,"" about a boy making his discomforting way in a new school, to The New Yorker. He took a job with a company called Magazine Management and rose to become editor of somewhat cheesy men's adventure publications with names like Male, Men's World, Men and True Action.

""The truth is, I tortured myself by moving back and forth, from one to the other,"" he wrote in ""Lucky Bruce,"" in which he also acknowledged the career arc that started at the top and declined. ""Stories, quite a few of them, got written and published,"" he wrote of the later years of his writing life. ""If they lacked energy (were less frantic?) I assured myself they were more 'dimensional.' Once I discovered that comforting description, I clung to it like life itself. There were a few books, some plays that still need attention. And quite a few pieces about me in the literary journals, wondering what had happened to me. ""Where had I gone? I began to feel like the most (fondly) remembered forgotten writer in America.""","An unusual case in American letters, he moved easily between literature and pop culture, including movies like ""Stir Crazy"" and ""Splash,"" to great acclaim.",7c2de8ab-e35d-5afe-817f-168fd14815b1,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/06/04/obituaries/00friedman_bruce1/00friedman_bruce1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3ae127a5665b92ca4957a44e98e69d36d29c405bdc12dfb479f2006d637330b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The author Bruce Jay Friedman in 1967 at an Off Broadway theater.

Economy,Hotel Group Will Return Tens of Millions in Small Business Loans,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/02/business/economy/ashford-hotels-virus-monty-bennett.html,"One of the biggest beneficiaries of the government's small business lending program said on Saturday that its companies will return at least $70 million in loans received through the Paycheck Protection Program. Ashford Inc., which oversees a tightly interwoven group of hotel and resorts, had seen its subsidiaries apply for $126 million in loans and the firm had previously said it planned to keep the money it received. On Saturday, citing new guidelines from the Small Business Administration that restrict who can receive funding, the company said its firms will return the loans. The decision came after media outlets, including The New York Times, detailed how Ashford had benefited from a program intended to help small businesses struggling to keep workers on payroll amid the coronavirus pandemic. The Trump administration had scrambled to tighten the program's rules after it became clear that companies like Ashford, along with other publicly-traded firms, were benefiting from a $660 billion program.

Last week, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said companies had until May 7 to voluntarily return the funds and that firms could be held ""criminally liable"" if they did not meet the program's criteria. He said the United States would audit any company that received more than $2 million in loans. The huge amount of money Ashford and its related companies applied for -- more than any other known company -- caught lawmaker attention. Senator Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York and the minority leader, had asked for an investigation into the company's loans, and Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee for this year's presidential race, wrote on Twitter that the firm should give the money back. Ashford Inc. and related companies announced on Saturday that they would return the funds by the government's May 7 deadline, saying the Small Business Administration's rule changes, including one on April 30 that suggested that corporate groups should not have access to unlimited funding, had shaken their thinking about whether they qualified.
* Ford and Rivian no longer plan to work jointly on electric vehicles.
* Elizabeth Holmes took the stand in her trial. Follow along with our reporters.
* Ken Griffin, head of Citadel, bid highest for a copy of the Constitution. ""While we believed then and continue to believe today that we qualify for P.P.P. loans based on the legislation and rule-making in place at the time our applications were submitted,"" the company said in its statement, ""continuous S.B.A. rule changes and evolving opinions by administration officials have led us to conclude that we may no longer qualify."" The company was one of several large firms that drew public ire after receiving funding that was intended to help smaller companies -- like dry cleaners, restaurants and nail salons -- keep paying their employees amid the coronavirus-induced shutdowns. Ashford's ability to receive money became a flash point in large part because the program quickly ran out of its initial $349 billion, drawing long backlogs of unfunded loans and leaving many tinier companies without relief. Congress has since allocated another $310 billion to the program but that money is also expected to be quickly depleted.

Ashford Inc. ""could not have known that congressional appropriations for the program would be insufficient to cover the needs of all other businesses in the nation that have suffered similar harm,"" it said in its statement. Ashford is headed by Monty Bennett, a conservative who has donated heavily to Republicans, including supporting Mr. Trump's 2016 campaign and directly providing more than $150,000 so far to his re-election bid. He had joined the broader hotel and restaurant industry in lobbying for a carve-out that allowed individual properties to apply for help if they employed fewer than 500 people ""per physical location."" For a time, he and his companies remained determined to hold onto the funding even as other businesses -- like Shake Shack and the Los Angeles Lakers -- announced that they would return the money. Mr. Bennett had complained that no other government relief was available for the hospitality industry, which has been hit hard by the virus as travelers cancel vacations and business trips. ""We call on Congress, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve to provide assistance to the hotel industry to protect jobs and asset values that have been severely impaired as a result of the pandemic and the government's actions that have followed,"" Mr. Bennett said in Ashford's Saturday statement. Mr. Bennett's hospitality empire is one of several big companies that qualified for the program thanks to an intentional loophole that came after a lobbying push. Ashford pushed back on the idea that it was a ""loophole"" in its Saturday statement. ""Congress designed the P.P.P. to specifically allow companies that own multiple hotel properties to obtain separate loans for each property as a means to prevent the economic collapse of the hospitality industry,"" it said.","Ashford Inc., which has come under scrutiny after receiving at least $70 million in Paycheck Protection Program loans, said on Saturday that it would return the money.",c3b7eae5-b4c7-5d9a-bf0e-a603cfc1971e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/05/01/business/02dc-virus-ashford-pix/01dc-virus-bigloans-02-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=3ae731ed17872898b40f53f71308d8ed830029b2504ea453ad665d289443449f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Ashford Inc., headed by Monty Bennett, said its subsidiaries will return at least $70 million in loans received through the Paycheck Protection Program.",c3b7eae5-b4c7-5d9a-bf0e-a603cfc1971e,N24News/imgs/c3b7eae5-b4c7-5d9a-bf0e-a603cfc1971e.jpg,8
Food,"From Wild Blueberries and Maine Terroir, Fine Sparkling Wine",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/15/dining/drinks/blueberry-wine-maine.html,"Eric Martin, left, and Michael Terrien, in a field of wild blueberries in Maine. They are now making sparkling wine from wild blueberries.





APPLETON, Me. -- Unless you have trained eyes, you could drive the narrow roads winding through the heart of coastal Maine's wild-blueberry country and never realize you were surrounded by acres of blueberry vines. They slither along close to the ground, the narrow leaves as green as grass. A field of wild- blueberry vines resembles nothing so much as a vast lawn. If you visit in late July as the berries near peak ripeness, you may spy a glint of blue here and there. Look closely, and troves of berries begin to reveal themselves, nearer to lavender than blue, and tinier than the more familiar plump high-bush berry that makes up most of the country's blueberry crop. Wild blueberries are Maine's bounty, the official state berry and a staple of roadside farm stands in the late summer. They are nutritious, tart, piquant and subtly complex. But there are problems: Because of competition, climate change and low commodity prices, farmers are not making enough money to sustain their businesses.

This situation has been more than disturbing to Michael Terrien, a California winemaker who lives in the city of Napa with his wife, Hannah Henry, and four children. Mr. Terrien's connection to wild blueberries is deep. He grew up in Cape Elizabeth, Me., just southeast of Portland, not far from blueberry territory, a narrow band that stretches northeast along the coast from southern Maine through far eastern Canada. Mr. Terrien, 51, has been making wine in Northern California for more than 20 years, with experience at Acacia and Hanzell. Now he makes lively chardonnays and pinot noirs under his own label, Terrien, as well as perfumed pinot noirs from the Santa Cruz Mountains under the U.S. Grant label, and a variety of wines at Obsidian Ridge Vineyard in Lake County.

For the last five years, Mr. Terrien and Ms. Henry, along with Mr. Terrien's childhood friend Eric Martin, and Mr. Martin's wife, Meredith McMonigle, have been making Bluet, a sparkling wine of wild blueberries with nothing added but yeast for fermentation. They make two styles: One, in tiny amounts, is made using the same method as Champagne, producing first a still wine and then refermenting it in a bottle to produce bubbles. The other, made in larger quantities, is produced like most Proseccos, carbonated in bulk in a pressurized tank. Bluet's most recent version of the Prosecco-style wine, bottled with a screw cap, smelled like violets, roses and, yes, blueberries. It was exuberant yet dry and savory, and, at 7 percent alcohol, deliciously easy to drink. The bottle-fermented wine, packaged like Champagne in a cork-topped bottle, is more contemplative. The 2017 was deeper, subtler, lightly savory and quietly complex. It, too, was about 7 percent alcohol, near the upper limit for blueberry wines. The two bottles made me wonder, why has this never been done before? For as long as humans have cultivated fruit, they have made some form of fruit wine. Fermentation is really just another form of preservation, after all, creating a tasty and intoxicating alternative to jams, pickles and other sometimes desperate efforts to conserve every last bit of summer's abundance.

Grapes, it happens, have the perfect ratio of sugar to acid, along with other elements that over time have come to represent the ideal source of table wine. Apples and pears can make wonderful cider, which is really another name for wine. Take another step and distill the wines, and you have an entirely different set of distinctive preserved fruits in the form of brandy, eau de vie, slivovitz and so on. Beautiful beverages have been made from cranberries, loganberries, blackberries and even Douglas fir buds. Blueberries? Other efforts I've tasted have been cloying and syrupy, better for pancakes than for drinking. It was one such experience that indirectly led to Bluet (pronounced the Maine way, BLUE-ett). Mr. Terrien and Mr. Martin were attending a bachelor party in Maine in the late 1990s, and were served a blueberry wine. ""It was so sweet, we couldn't drink it,"" Mr. Martin recalled. ""Michael said there had to be a way to make better blueberry wine than this."" Though called wild blueberries, the fruit is cultivated. Farmers sell primarily to big processors who freeze the berries and sell them for industrial uses, like blueberry-muffin mix. Unlike the high-bush berries, which have been bred and modified to enhance particular traits, wild blueberries have not been altered. The notion of blueberry wine arose again after Mr. Terrien and Ms. Henry were married in 2000 in a barn belonging to Mr. Terrien's aunt and uncle in Jefferson, Me., just a few miles southwest of Appleton. Everything for the reception -- the lobsters, the vegetables, the desserts -- had come from Maine, except the wine, because there were no good Maine wines.

""It was the missing piece, and one of the first times we thought seriously about it,"" Mr. Terrien said. It took a while for the project to coalesce. Mr. Martin, a novelist who also works in nonprofit organizations, lives in Durham, N.C. Each summer, the families would converge in Maine, and during these interludes they would experiment with wild-blueberry beverages. ""Playing around confirmed we could make something we would like to drink,"" Mr. Terrien said. Why sparkling wine? I tasted a still blueberry wine from the 2018 vintage destined to be refermented in bottles. It smelled of blueberries and was dry, but something was missing.

This deficiency might cause a producer to add sugar, as in sweet commercial fruit wines, or to doctor a mediocre chardonnay with oak flavors. But Mr. Terrien was determined to make a wine that expressed the spirit of the fruit and the place. ""The purity of this fruit, growing in this place 10,000 years since the glaciers receded, has more right to be turned into wine than pinot noir,"" he said. ""It's a cultural dance between fruit and people. It's been here forever, and people have done nothing with it!"" He thought of Champagne, which, before the climate began to warm, was made in a marginal environment where the grapes would barely ripen most years. A still Champagne, decades ago, might have tasted thin and dull.

""In order to make it good, it needed bubbles,"" Mr. Terrien said of the blueberry wine. ""Just like Champagne, it needed the bubbles to make an otherwise lower alcohol, meager wine complete."" In 2014, they made their first batch, 50 cases' worth, in the same barn where Mr. Terrien had been married. It sold out quickly, entirely in the Portland area. Working without a template, they made mistakes. At first, the bubbly wine had a tendency to erupt from the bottle when opened. Early on, Mr. Terrien believed that the berries, with thin skins and barely discernible seeds, needed something to provide additional structure, so he included leaves in the fermentation. They added a distinct herbal flavor, which was not unpleasant but perhaps not optimal. The learning curve has been quick, and each year, the wine has gotten better. They've moved out of the barn and into their own unit in an industrial park in Scarborough, Me. Perhaps more important has been building relationships with blueberry growers, like Linda and Cary Nash in Appleton, who farm about 600 acres but last year did not harvest some plots because the price they were paid was too low.

Mr. Terrien said the growers need to get 50 cents a pound to break even. Bluet is offering 70 cents a pound, three times what the processors were willing to pay in 2018. This ray of hope has attracted the attention of the state of Maine , which, in its effort to preserve agricultural traditions, has given Bluet grants and loans. The company plans to buy 40 tons of fruit in 2019, a significant increase from the 22 tons it bought last year, to make about 36,000 bottles. About 90 percent of that will be the simpler wine, to be sold primarily in Maine, with a little in New York, Massachusetts and California, and the rest will be the Champagne style, sold only in Maine. Consumers in many states can also buy directly from Bluet's website. Mr. Terrien knows this is just a trickle. For the farming business to turn around, and for wild- blueberry wine to prosper, he said, an entire industry would have to develop, both to build a wine economy and to gain a better understanding of the terroir of wild blueberries.

Science,'Crazy Jigsaw Puzzles' Improve Our Views of Coral Reefs,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/22/science/coral-reefs-3d-photomosaics.html,"A photomosaic of corals made using 2,700 individual images taken at a reef at the Palmyra Atoll in the Pacific Ocean.

A century ago, if you wanted to document ocean life, you'd throw on a 60-pound glass helmet, dive in and sketch whatever passed by with a lead pencil on a zinc tablet. Today most scientists studying corals still dive with an hour's worth of oxygen and a plastic piece of paper, using their personal judgments to jot down all they can before the air runs out. But over the last few years, technology has catapulted oceanography into a new era of discovery. Now a scientist can carry along a camera in a waterproof box, take thousands of photographs an hour and upload those images to computers too fast to exist a decade ago. Powerful software then stitches together the photos and identifies unique features, creating billions of reference points that help to calculate the location of corals in 3D space.

""It's like doing one of the most crazy jigsaw puzzles you can ever imagine,"" said Stuart Sandin, a coral reef ecologist at Scripps Institution of Oceanography at the University of California, San Diego. He and his colleagues have just analyzed some of the first of these 3D photomosaics in a study published last month in the journal, Coral Reefs.

With the help of computer scientists and engineers at their university, Dr. Sandin and his team created their digital maps using more than 39,000 photos of about 44,000 coral colonies living on reefs at Palmyra Atoll near Hawaii. In analyzing digital reconstructions of about 1,000 square feet each, they discovered for the first time that rather than distributing themselves randomly wherever larvae happened to fall, coral follow somewhat of a pattern. Corals of every species and type, especially those that have similar forms and structures, cluster together across the reef. And some types are more clustered than others.

Perhaps the most clustered corals were those with a particular body type that more easily breaks apart with waves or other disturbances and then regrows, like staghorn coral. These corals grow up from the bottom of the reef and stretch out like antlers. They form colonies, ""but you can break off one of those antlers and put it somewhere else, and it will grow."" The scientists think breaking and clustering is how forms of coral such as these hold onto space and survive on a highly competitive reef. They believe it's a sign of health in this protected atoll, where bleaching, overfishing and disease are not really threats.

""The 800-pound gorilla is that the climate is changing,"" and the prevailing story is that it affects corals disproportionately, Dr. Sandin said. But some corals are doing well and others are recovering. He wants to know where they are and how they're doing it. He hopes new data will change public perception that only bad things happen to corals. The researchers' finding that corals grow in clusters also has practical applications for conservationists planting corals for new colonies: It's probably best to plant them in patches. With time reduced and accuracy improved by technological advances, ""It's an exciting time to see the way that we can explore the ocean,"" Dr. Sandin said.",An analysis of 3D photomosaics of reefs in the Pacific Ocean could help scientists better understand the health of coral around the world.,5a776093-0dc6-5ee0-a60f-b4555ddc0724,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/22/science/23TB-CORAL3/merlin_130416182_f50b438b-e6fd-45d9-9632-9b64678eb4d6-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b53eb52f86bc8e621ebe48435434ad39e845cdd40c043f77037f81cae3778c4f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The digitized photomosaic, showing each individual coral colony, with every coral species outlined and labelled with a different color.

Travel,Bloomsday Is Over but Joyce Left Plenty of Trail to Trace,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/16/travel/bloomsday-james-joyce-dublin-paris-london.html,"This year, more than most, offers plenty of excuses to celebrate the life and work of James Joyce. This January marked the 75th anniversary of his death. Bloomsday - June 16 - is the date on which his novel ""Ulysses"" is set. And December is the 100th anniversary of the publication of his first novel, ""A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man."" I followed Joyce's trail earlier this year, a challenge because he was always on the move. But I pared my itinerary down to Dublin, where the Joyce family house-hopped to avoid creditors; London, where he married; and Paris, where he joined fellow literary lions. Joyce was born in 1882, the eldest of 10 children, in Dublin and lived in as many as 20 homes during his family's downward mobility, which coincided with his childhood. A great place to contemplate his life in Dublin is with an overview. The James Joyce Tower and Museum on Sandycove overlooks the coast. As I stood outside the museum, beneath the flag fluttering in the strong wind, I surveyed a hill beyond the water, and felt the sea air washed over me.

The author in 1904 briefly stayed in the museum's tower, which is featured in the opening of ""Ulysses,"" but fled it after an altercation. The museum, which opened on Bloomsday 1962, now houses a trove of Joyce memorabilia, including photos, handwritten letters and first editions of ""Ulysses"" and other books. A few weeks after his departure from the tower, Joyce left Ireland. As I left the museum, I imagined a slim Joyce walking nimbly down the small and narrow steps down to the rocks and onto the street, running not only from the tower but from his country. Though Joyce essentially exiled himself from Ireland, Dublin celebrates the life of the native son who wrote about the city as both a setting and character. The James Joyce Centre on North Georges Street has three floors of information, memorabilia and documentaries of the author's life. Both the Joyce Centre and the museum at Sandycove display busts of Joyce's death mask, made two days after his death in Zurich in 1941. They also host the Joyce Circular Tour around the north inner city, which visits significant places in the author's life and work. The Dubliners Tour is a walk to locations from the ""The Dubliners"" short story collection and Joyce's life. A guide named Marty Gilroy took us on the circular tour, which is not quite circular: It begins at the center and ends at James Joyce's statue on North Earl Street. There, he quoted from a letter Joyce sent to his brother Stanislaus in 1905 while he was living in Trieste: ""When you remember that Dublin has been a capital for a thousand years, that it is the 'second' city of the British Empire, that it is nearly three times as big as Venice, it seems strange that no artist has given it to the world."" After living with a woman named Nora Barnacle for 27 years and having two children with her, Joyce traveled to London in 1931 to marry her to settle his family's inheritance. By then, he was famous, and though the couple tried to keep their nuptials secret, journalists followed them to their residence at 28B Campden Grove in Kensington. Joyce so disliked the place that he called it ""Campden Grave,"" Nevertheless, a blue plaque hangs at the building 28 Campden Grove, distinguishing it as an English Heritage site.

From Campden Grove, you could take walks that pause at other literary heritage sites. Five minutes away is the former home of the poet Ezra Pound, Joyce's friend, at 10 Kensington Church Walk; another 10 minutes in the opposite direction is the former home of T. S. Eliot, Joyce's contemporary, at 3 Kensington Court Gardens; and about three minutes away is the home of the novelist Ford Madox Ford, at 80 Campden Hill Road. Joyce lived in the city for more than 20 years, becoming an essential part of a literary community that included Pound, Eliot, Ford, Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and F. Scott Fitzgerald. It is also the place where he finished writing ""Ulysses"" and ""Finnegans Wake"" thanks to financial support from the editor Harriet Shaw Weaver and the publisher Sylvia Beach. Beach owned an English language bookstore and lending library called Shakespeare and Company, which opened in 1919 at 12, rue de l'Odeon. The bookstore was closed during the German occupation of France during the Second World War and never reopened. At the old location is a plaque that says in French: ""In 1922, in this house, Sylvia Beach published Ulysses by James Joyce."" A new Shakespeare and Company bookstore is near the Seine down a small curved street and overlooks the Notre-Dame Cathedral. It was opened in 1951 and renamed in honor of Beach by George Whitman and is now run by his daughter, Sylvia Beach Whitman. It, too, has become a literary hub, with regular readings and events in addition to a cache of books for sale. The Hotel Lutetia, the last place Joyce stayed in the city, is currently under construction covered in taupe and scaffolding but is still worth a visit to see the vast architecture peering above the covering. Joyce completed ""Ulysses"" at the French writer Valery Larbaud's apartment on 71, rue Cardinal Lemoine. Larbaud was also one of the translators of ""Ulysses"" to French. A plaque at the building acknowledges its two famous residents. But perhaps the best way to commune with Joyce is to open up his books. No airfare is required for that.","A guided tour of James Joyce's life in Dublin, London and Paris.",ced8828d-218c-5211-a651-224873b11ba7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/07/16/travel/16joyce-wtg-sub/16joyce-wtg-sub-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=549&w=1050&s=104e8175c74e5b59402f10a2e4d0480a54139c4444f3a49fee7333eded632fe2&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Martello Tower in Sandycove, where Joyce briefly stayed.",ced8828d-218c-5211-a651-224873b11ba7,N24News/imgs/ced8828d-218c-5211-a651-224873b11ba7.jpg,4
Fashion & Style,"For Millennial Men, Gray Hair Is Welcome",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/04/fashion/for-millennial-men-gray-hair-is-welcome.html,"On two magazine covers the singer Zayn Malik has graced in the last few months -- for Billboard and L'Uomo Vogue (as well as the racy video with his girlfriend, Gigi Hadid) -- he looks every bit the young brooding pop star. The requisite smoldering stare, perfectly manicured stubble and bad boy tattoos are all in tow. Zayn Malik sported gray locks for the cover of Billboard magazine. And then there's the hair. Mr. Malik, 23, a former member of the musical group One Direction, peers out in both images from beneath a silver mane. This isn't a case of a young man going prematurely gray, but a premeditated decision by the performer, who has a penchant for dyeing his hair and then broadcasting it to his 6.5 million Instagram followers. Gus Kenworthy, the Olympic freestyle skier who came out as gay last year on the cover of ESPN magazine, debuted an ashen dye job in December on his Instagram account, thanking Anderson Cooper, the CNN news anchor, for the inspiration, adding the hashtag #50shadesofgay.

Gone are the days when guys would actively avoid graying hair. For a new generation of adventurous men, dyeing one's hair gray is gaining traction, appropriating a naturally occurring phenomenon from older men and giving it a millennial twist. ""Men are embracing color more in a general way,"" said Amie Rau, a stylist at Matthew Morris Salon in Denver, who dyed Mr. Kenworthy's hair. ""This is an extension of that."" Both Mr. Malik and Mr. Kenworthy declined to be interviewed for this article. Ms. Rau said that since their first session, Mr. Kenworthy had brought in an image of a young woman with dyed gray hair as inspiration. ""He kept asking me, 'Is it crazy that I want to do this?'"" After the ESPN cover, 24-year-old Mr. Kenworthy went to Ms. Rau to go platinum blond. ""I said: 'You know, you just came out to an entire nation. You should do what you want to do,""' she recalled saying. Gray and silver hair has definitely been trending, said Aura Friedman, a senior hair colorist at Sally Hershberger Salon in New York. ""The demographic of guys who come to me to go gray are doing it more as a fashion statement,"" she said, as opposed to a more natural look. Ms. Friedman has dyed the hair of Phillip Picardi, the digital editorial director of Teen Vogue, and Drew Elliott, the chief creative officer for Paper magazine, among others.

Interest definitely seems to be up. A representative from Amazon said it had seen a threefold increase in the last year in customers searching for gray hair dye. ""It's kind of an ironic statement, especially when the wearer is noticeably young and probably years away from natural graying,"" said Michael Fisher, creative director of men's wear at Fashion Snoops, the trend forecasting agency. ""It's just another bold way to stand out from the crowd."" Tyler Oakley, 26, the social media personality who parlayed his online cachet into the documentary ""Snervous"" and book ""Binge"" last year, has experimented with his hair color, adopting many shades, from purple to green. ""Gray is the favorite color I've ever had,"" he said. ""It was unique and fun, but it's not eye catching in the way that like lilac or mint was. When I had those colors, I felt like everyone was looking at me. With gray, I felt like I was trying on a new look but it was also relatively natural."" Celebrities aren't the only ones to take the plunge.  Admittedly, part of that is because of the positive response he received from friends and on social media, getting 90 ""likes"" on his Instagram account. ""Of course, my mom doesn't like it,"" Mr. Vasquez said with a laugh.

Achieving the silver fox look is an involved process. ""In the industry we call it a bleach and tone or a double process,"" Ms. Friedman said, referring to a two-part procedure in which the hair is first stripped of its natural pigment and then colored, an undertaking that can last eight hours and is often costly. While there is a range in prices depending on hair length and color, Ms. Friedman estimated that going gray would start at $350 at most salons. (She estimated a session for her services would be $600.) And that doesn't take into account upkeep. ""It does require a lot of maintenance, going back to the salon for touch-ups and conditioning it at home with the right products in between appointments,"" she said. The continued care also requires commitment, Ms. Rau said. ""It's like owning a pet,"" she said. Tyler Oakley, at Out100 in November 2014, wearing it gray. However, because there are so many shades of gray -- from those with bluish undertones to more natural variations -- the color must be versatile enough to compliment a variety of skin tones. ""When you've got gray hair, every move you make seems 'young' and 'spry,'"" Andy Warhol said in his 1975 book ""The Philosophy of Andy Warhol (From A to B & Back Again)"" to explain his decision to dye his hair gray in his early 20s, a look that became his calling card. ""It's like you're getting a new talent."" While there aren't many precedents for young men co-opting the hoary coifs of their elders, trendsetting women like the fashion blogger Tavi Gevinson, the pop star Grimes and Tilda Swinton have all embraced a faux gray. ""It has nothing to do with wanting to look old,"" said Mr. Fisher of Fashion Snoops. ""We are in the midst of a time when guys are breaking their own boundaries and really finding new ways to express themselves. Having gray hair plays right into that.""","For a new generation of stylish men, the journey toward silver locks is something they have chosen to accelerate.",6d97a7cd-7e6b-5441-9cf3-15650d2379ba,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/02/04/fashion/04GRAY-WEB1/04GRAY-WEB1-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=073ae0628b92f20fc6505a6ec34a3601cc6438636b8d59f2c87404389743392e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"""I've always been confident, but now I feel more fun and cooler,"" Michael Vasquez, a 30-year-old senior business analyst, said of his artificial gunmetal hue, now several months old.

Travel,A Maltese Hotel with Baroque Design and Mediterranean Flair,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/22/travel/where-to-stay-in-malta-hotel-palazzo-consiglia-valetta.html,"Housed in a traditional Maltese townhouse dating back 400 years, this 13-room boutique hotel represents the Mediterranean island nation's varied cultural influences -- Roman, Arab, French and British, to name a few. From marble floors and exposed limestone walls to brown rattan furniture and Oriental rugs, the decor exudes both Baroque and Mediterranean flair. Opened in June 2016, the restored property has a lobby that leads to a courtyard revealing inner balconies on each of the four floors. Rooms can be reached via a tiny glass elevator or a dizzying steel staircase with a magnificent light fixture that seems to descend from the sky. In February, the hotel opened a spa below ground where guests can soak in a whirlpool beneath a vaulted ceiling.

In the center of Valletta, the country's capital and a city on Unesco's World Heritage list, the hotel is about a 40-minute drive from Malta International Airport and a short walk from the Grand Harbor, Lower Barrakka Gardens and St. John's Co-Cathedral, among other sites.

From ""Romantica"" to ""Ecologica,"" each room has a different name and decor. We were pleasantly surprised by our spacious second-floor ""Religioso"" suite. It featured two plump twin beds (you can request a queen) with ornate wooden headboards, and a sofa bed under a fresco-style wall print that dominated the space. With scant natural light from the one courtyard-facing window and a color scheme of red, gold and beige, the room evoked a holy sanctuary. But it also radiated opulence, with furnishings including a vintage Gothic armoire with tall mirrors and a giant silver candelabrum (sans candles).","The 13-room Palazzo Consiglia represents the Mediterranean island's varied cultural influences — Roman, Arab, French and British, to name a few.",620ff60c-eff6-5d20-ab5c-9774b28806fc,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/07/16/travel/16CHECKIN2/16CHECKIN2-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1f9b5d26550f50f8fb1b2a1a79f39ec6db3371cfcd1e671c609001e6da25595b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The Palazzo Consiglio in Malta is a small boutique hotel with a 360-degree view of the city and the harbor.

Art & Design,A Cree Artist Redraws History,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/19/arts/design/kent-monkman-metropolitan-museum.html,"Kent Monkman's painting ""Welcoming the Newcomers"" in the Great Hall of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.Credit...Aaron Wynia for The New York Times

Coonskin caps for Christmas! I was a kid in mid-20th-century America. The biggest cultural event I can remember from early childhood was Walt Disney's gigantically popular ""Davy Crockett: Indian Fighter"" on TV. The first installment of a serial, which debuted on Dec. 15, 1954, it was basically about the exploits of a Tennessee backwoods gun-for-hire, and promoted nostalgia for the days when the Wild West was ""won"" from indigenous peoples. A verse of the theme song, which was everywhere on the radio, went: Andy Jackson is our gen'ral's name

His reg'lar soldiers we'll put to shame

Them redskin varmints us Volunteers'll tame

'Cause we got the guns with the surefire aim

Davy, Davy Crockett, the champion of us all! Andy Jackson was, of course, Andrew Jackson, seventh president of the United States, whose 1830 signing of the Indian Removal Act led to the Trail of Tears, and whose portrait now hangs, at the request of the 45th and sitting president, in the Oval Office of the White House. All this came back to mind when I saw ""The Great Hall Commission: Kent Monkman, mistikosiwak (Wooden Boat People)"" at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. The second in a continuing series of contemporary works sponsored by the Met, it consists of two monumental new paintings by the Canadian artist Kent Monkman, installed on either side of the museum's main entrance in the soaring Great Hall. The paintings are pretty stupendous. Each measuring almost 11 feet by 22 feet, they are multi-figured narratives, inspired by a Euro-American tradition of history painting but entirely present-tense in theme and tone. And both are unmistakably polemical, suggesting that with this and other commissions -- an earlier one, sculptures by the Kenyan-born artist Wangechi Mutu, is still in place on the museum's Fifth Avenue facade -- certain winds of change could be blowing through the Met's art-temple precincts. Mr. Monkman, 54, is one of Canada's best-known contemporary artists, and one who has stirred controversy on his home ground. Of mixed Cree and Irish heritage, he has made the violence done under European occupation, to North America's first peoples, a central subject of his work.

But he has also, crucially, flipped a conventional, disempowering idea of Native victimhood on its head. His paintings, done in a crisply realistic, highly detailed, somewhat cut-and-paste illustrational style, are far from grim. In many of them, humor and erotic, usually homoerotic, fantasy have an important role. So does the image of the artist himself in the guise of his alter ego, a buff, cross-dressing, gender-fluid tribal leader named Miss Chief Eagle Testickle. Updating the figure of the ""berdache,"" a transsexual figure traditional in Indigenous cultures, and channeling Cher in her ""Half Breed"" phase, Miss Chief is an avatar of a global future that will see humankind moving beyond the wars of identity -- racial, sexual, political -- in which it is now perilously immersed.

One of the two paintings, ""Welcoming the Newcomers,"" depicts such an arrival, with Native people greeting strangers at the Atlantic shore. But the scene is less a reception than a rescue. A capsized boat is visible in the distance. The newcomers are exhausted swimmers who've barely made it to land: an English ""pilgrim"" in a buckled stovepipe hat; an enslaved black man, shackles on his arms; a missionary clutching a crucifix; an impoverished Frenchwoman sent abroad to help populate the New World. All are being pulled from the water by native inhabitants, led by Miss Chief. Old stereotypes -- fearless pioneers, hostile natives -- are banished.

And with them go other cliches. Several of the painting's Indigenous figures are based on examples of 19th-century art in the Met's collection. Among them are sculptures like ""Mexican Girl Dying"" by Thomas Crawford (1846), on view in the museum's American Wing, and paintings like Eugene Delacroix's ""The Natchez,"" in the 19th- and early 20th-Century European galleries. Each of the originals perpetuates the myth of the Native Americans as a vanishing people, doomed to disappear, a fiction that usefully underpinned and fueled another myth, that of Western ""Manifest Destiny."" In Mr. Monkman's paintings, Indigenous people are, for the most part, proactive figures, shaping the world around them, which doesn't mean he ignores the catastrophes that followed the European occupation. When Mr. Monkman appropriates Henry Inman's 1830s portrait of Eagle of Delight, also named Hayne Hudjihini, a native woman noted for her beauty, he marks her chest and shoulders with traces of measles, the imported disease from which she died. And when he depicts the figure of a child apparently sick and dying in his mother's arms, he lifts the figure from a painting of ""The Massacre of the Innocents"" by the European artist Francois Joseph Navez. Mr. Monkman's image of the child -- a reference to the damage done by the forced placement of Indigenous children in white-run boarding schools -- appears in the second Met-commissioned painting, ""Resurgence of the People."" Here we are in an imagined future. Centuries have passed since ""Welcoming the Newcomers."" Terrible things have happened to the planet. The only remaining bit of solid earth is an island guarded by armed white nationalists and soon to be submerged by a churning oil-slicked sea.

Indigenous people now command an open boat, of a kind familiar from contemporary news photos of refugees. People rescued in the first painting are now rescuers themselves, pulling in and tending to whoever swims toward them, including a white businessman wearing a chunky gold watch and Hermes tie. All of the boat's rowers are Indigenous; more than half are women dressed in contemporary traditional styles, their skin ornamented with symbolic tattoos. And once again Miss Chief presides over all, leads the way forward. Nude except for high heels and filmy salmon-colored wrap, she's modeled on the title figure in Emanuel Leutze's 1851 painting ""Washington Crossing the Delaware,"" one of the Met's most popular American art attractions. The effect is simultaneously loopy and moving, the way extreme theater can be. Both Monkman pictures are, indeed, based on a form of theater. They're painted from photographs of models posing in elaborately staged tableaus in the artist's Toronto studio. The studio itself, which I visited recently, is run like a classic atelier, with several hands contributing to a final product. Mr. Monkman prepares initial drawings and stage-directs the photographic sessions. Several young painters, whom he has trained, then execute the final image in acrylic on canvas, to which he adds finishing touches, sometimes extensive.

Books,A Death-Haunted Poetry Book Mulls Life's Reversals of Fortune,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/18/books/review/dunce-mary-ruefle.html,"""No one has yet to begin a life who will not end it,"" Mary Ruefle writes in ""On Beginnings,"" the first piece in her collected lectures, ""Madness, Rack, and Honey."" It's more of a lecture on endings, actually: ""Not every poem is finished,"" but an abandoned poem is not fully a poem, much as a life is not complete until it's over. In ""Short Lecture on the Dead,"" she writes, ""People who are alive are not really people because they haven't died."" We extant folks have not done all the people things yet, since dying is a requirement of personhood.

In ""Dunce,"" her latest poetry collection, Ruefle confronts the extraordinary yet banal fact that all of us die. How do we reconcile the boringness of death-in-general with the shock of our own, specific death? ""I am walking in the general direction / of things,"" she writes; ""I was nothing / and shall be nothing again."" To live is to walk in death's general direction. Death is our destiny, the Hollywood ending for each of us -- what could be more predictable? And yet. (My favorite Issa haiku: ""The world of dew / is the world of dew. / And yet, and yet--"")

Our own deaths, though certain, do not seem possible perhaps until our parents die -- as though this were the true end of childhood, and so the end of youth. The presence of an older generation is a comfort, a weighted blanket, that makes us feel protected; its absence creates the inexorable sense that we're next. Ruefle's mother's death haunts this collection -- it feels as if her death itself is the ghost, the event and not the person. Take the poem ""Bath Time"":

We learn from ""I Remember, I Remember,"" Ruefle's essay-lecture in the style of Joe Brainard, that she was 45 when her mother died, and ""it poured the day we buried her."" All rain now is funeral rain. In the poem ""Lightly, Very Lightly"": ""It was raining. / I could hear the rain / taking the pins out of her mouth."" In ""Little Travel Book,"" a black car rolls backward out of a garage: ""This is sad, like Stonehenge in the rain."" In ""Halloween,"" a fake corpse with a motion detector ""sat up,"" ""its eyes rolled back to white,"" and ""turned its head around, / all the way around,"" when you approached it. This, Ruefle writes, ""reminded me of my mother / and at the thought of my mother / there was a corpse in me."" These references register as a pain in my chest (my own mother has begun to complain of chest pain).","""Dunce,"" by Mary Ruefle, confronts the extraordinary yet inescapable fact that all of us die.",94486b5b-e432-5b60-a5e4-f7371d4b1b9b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/11/03/books/review/03Gabbert1/Gabbert1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=780e419c036fd708b2846de44d7db8695036587823715bc92978a284482bcca7&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mary Ruefle&rsquo;s new poetry book, &ldquo;Dunce,&rdquo; haunted by the death of her mother, was longlisted for a National Book Award.",94486b5b-e432-5b60-a5e4-f7371d4b1b9b,N24News/imgs/94486b5b-e432-5b60-a5e4-f7371d4b1b9b.jpg,13
Sports,What the N.B.A.'s West Teams Need: Shooters and Shady Texts,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/17/sports/basketball/nba-warriors-clippers-lakers.html,"Finally -- finally -- the N.B.A. off-season is here. Sure, it's October, months removed from when the off-season would typically begin if there wasn't a pandemic. And of course, the Los Angeles Lakers are still trying to figure out if they can throw a Zoom championship parade after conquering the Walt Disney World bubble. This means that 30 N.B.A. teams are about to reload, retool or reset through trades, free agency and the draft, though the league still needs to sort out the financial impact of the pandemic and set the salary cap for next season. The Western Conference is a particularly tough nut to crack. The Lakers won the championship and should be assumed to be the favorites to win again, given their dominant playoff run. But other teams with young stars might have something to say about that.

So for all the general managers out there, we have some suggestions for one thing every team in the West needs to do this off-season. Anthony Davis has a player option this off-season, and if the Lakers persuade him to sign an extension, that's a success. With Davis and LeBron James, the team would remain title favorites even with Statler, Waldorf and me rounding out the starting lineup. The Clippers were an expensive Hollywood production with A-list stars meant to win it all during awards season. But instead, they were upstaged by less established talent. In other words, they were Netflix's ""The Irishman."" Their path forward is not ideal: They probably won't have much cap space. Montrezl Harrell, the sixth man of the year, and Marcus Morris are unrestricted free agents. They don't have a first-round draft pick, and their two stars, Kawhi Leonard and Paul George, can leave after the 2020-21 season. The Clippers have to bank on one thing: fixing their chemistry. It was an issue all season, so in theory, a new coach could come along and mend that, given Leonard and George's talent.

The Nuggets are in one of the better positions in the league: Their franchise cornerstone, Nikola Jokic, is locked up through 2022-23. He has a solid, if inconsistent, secondary player in Jamal Murray, signed through 2023-24. They have some big contracts coming off the books, freeing cap space. But their most crucial move might be right under their noses. Jerami Grant was a solid contributor on both ends and can test the free-agent market. The Nuggets would do well to keep him. All the Warriors have to do this off-season is wrap Stephen Curry in cellophane. If the Warriors are healthy next season -- this means a rested Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green -- Golden State will be a solid title contender.

The Rockets need to surround James Harden and Russell Westbrook with shooting. They showed that their miniball style can work, but Westbrook's jump shooting woes became an issue in the postseason, and Houston needs someone to take the pressure off Harden. The Rockets, with no cap space, will have to solve this either through trade or free agency on the cheap. Kyle Korver and Isaiah Thomas might fit the bill here offensively, but defensively -- yikes. This is an attractive franchise: a bevy of future draft picks, compelling young talent like Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, a head coach opening. And Chris Paul, at 35, showed he was still one of the best point guards in the game.

There is not much for the Thunder to do, other than try to hit home runs with their two late-first-round draft picks. Relax and enjoy the ride. See the light at the end of the tunnel. They do not have enough cap space to attract a top-tier free agent to play alongside Paul. The team's most tradable asset is Steven Adams, who has a roughly $27.5 million expiring contract. But the team is best off letting it expire rather than taking on other contracts. Be as competitive as you can until 2021-22, when you will have cap space, draft picks and maybe Paul to make a legitimate run. The Jazz are capped out, both in salary and their talent ceiling. They're not good enough to play with the Lakers, but they're not bad enough to get lottery picks. Rudy Gobert has a $27.5 million expiring contract, and given his pandemic-related tensions with Donovan Mitchell, it's worth asking whether the team would be better off with a center who can space the floor. Upgrade defensively. They'll have their midlevel exception and a first-round draft pick to do so. They have two franchise blue chips in Luka Doncic and Kristaps Porzingis, but the team was 18th defensively last season. (A caveat: Porzingis just had surgery to repair a meniscus injury in his right knee. He has had trouble staying healthy for most of his career, but he really showed his potential in the playoffs.) Bonus: Give Boban Marjanovic more playing time. Because the world is suffering and we need a smile. This team barely got to an eighth seed, an underwhelming campaign. But if Jusuf Nurkic and Zach Collins can be healthy for a full season, the Blazers will be formidable. Maybe. Or Portland can hope that an opposing star insults Damian Lillard's rap talents, fueling an aggrieved run for the ages.

Move the team's home arena to Walt Disney World, where the Suns went 8-0 in the bubble. Aside from that, the Suns are one of the few teams with lots of cap space and a lottery pick. It's a less top-heavy draft class than usual, but Danilo Gallinari and Montrezl Harrell are legitimate free-agent targets for them. Promise Coach Gregg Popovich that he won't have to do any more sideline interviews, and the Spurs will go 82-0. Aside from that, much of their off-season will hinge on whether DeMar DeRozan will opt in for the final year of his contract. The Spurs should hope he stays. Under the radar, DeRozan has played some of the best basketball of his career in San Antonio. Trade Buddy Hield, who has not so subtly suggested he wants out of Sacramento, and hand the keys over to Bogdan Bogdanovic, a restricted free agent. Hield is a young, talented guard on a reasonable contract who can net the Kings some assets. If this drags on, the Kings will lose leverage. Find the right coach for Zion Williamson. Players are more likely than ever to force their way off teams, even when locked into contracts. Any year of Williamson's prime squandered with a coach who doesn't mesh with him is an invitation for Williamson to try to leave when he can, as LeBron James did in Cleveland. Minnesota has the No. 1 pick in the draft, as well as a Nets first-rounder. The Timberwolves have one of the best young players in the league, with Karl-Anthony Towns, and a talented guard beside him, D'Angelo Russell. Minnesota cannot whiff on the first pick. Go get James Wiseman. His athleticism will allow him to play three positions on the floor and Minnesota needs both wing and frontcourt help.","It will take some teams more than one off-season to retool themselves into contention, but there is at least one thing each team can do to improve. Here are our suggestions.",0de70f11-6164-5eff-b3fc-91c777b642d2,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/13/sports/00nba-west-curry/00nba-west-curry-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6459075094e3ef2ada944c059d2830c5ca3c368c1dc8fe4482cda323b9108106&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Stephen Curry wasn't much of a factor this year, but that shouldn't be the case in the 2020-21 season.",0de70f11-6164-5eff-b3fc-91c777b642d2,N24News/imgs/0de70f11-6164-5eff-b3fc-91c777b642d2.jpg,9
Books,How 'Rage' Challenged Bob Woodward,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/30/books/bob-woodward-rage-donald-trump.html,"""What Trump has done, particularly on the virus -- I have lots of emotions and reporter's conclusions about it, but I'm embarrassed for him. I am embarrassed for the country,"" Bob Woodward said.





When Bob Woodward was writing his latest book, ""Rage,"" he kept a stash of Olympus digital tape recorders scattered around his Washington, D.C., rowhouse. There was one at his bedside, one in his third-floor office, one that floated between the kitchen and the den, and another always in his pocket. He had them everywhere because he often didn't know when President Trump would call. ""It was a very unusual experience,"" Mr. Woodward said in an interview. ""I have to be ready to take that call at 10 o'clock at night and then say, what about George Floyd? Or what about the Supreme Court? What's your relationship with Mitch McConnell?"" If this was an unconventional way to write a book about a sitting U.S. president, Mr. Woodward, 77, would be in a position to know. In his 50 years as a journalist, he has written 20 books and covered nine presidents. The scope and depth of his work have earned him a unique place in politics and journalism as perhaps the most enduring chronicler of American presidents. At either end of his long bibliography are two of the most divisive American presidents in generations: Richard Nixon and Mr. Trump. ""There are a lot of people who have written great books, masterpieces, about individual presidents,"" said Jamie Gangel, a special correspondent at CNN and a longtime friend of Mr. Woodward. ""But I can't think of anybody who has his breadth of experience.""

Perhaps the biggest news out of ""Rage"" comes from two interviews he conducted with the president earlier this year: in February, when Mr. Trump told him that the coronavirus was ""deadly stuff,"" and in March, when Mr. Trump said he ""wanted to always play it down"" so as not to create panic. Critics have accused Mr. Woodward of holding those revelations back for his book, saying that had he decided to release the information earlier, he might have saved lives. Mr. Woodward has strenuously denied this, saying that at the time of the February call, he thought Mr. Trump was referring to what was going on in China. Believing the United States to be safe from the virus, Mr. Woodward kept traveling around the country. And by the time the call in March occurred, the president had already made an address about the pandemic from the Oval Office. Another criticism, one that has followed Mr. Woodward for years, was that he wrote books stuffed with facts while offering little in the way of analysis. But his more recent work, including his final take on George W. Bush and both volumes on Trump, have been clearer in their judgments. The last line of ""Rage"" is among his most direct: ""When his performance as president is taken in its entirety, I can only reach one conclusion: Trump is the wrong man for the job.""

Mr. Woodward said he had no plans to write that sentence until he typed it. ""I've done all this work on presidents,"" Mr. Woodward said. ""Some of them have made mistakes, Nixon was certainly a criminal, but what Trump has done, particularly on the virus -- I have lots of emotions and reporter's conclusions about it, but I'm embarrassed for him. I am embarrassed for the country."" In its first week, ""Rage"" sold 600,000 copies, according to its publisher, Simon & Schuster, and debuted at No. 1 on The New York Times' best-seller list. While those are monster sales by any normal measure, they're significantly lower than sales for his first Trump book, ""Fear,"" which was published in 2018. ""Fear"" sold 1.1 million copies in its first week, and more than 750,000 copies in its first day. Mary Trump's book on her uncle, Mr. Trump, broke Simon & Schuster's record this year, selling 950,000 on day one.

Simon & Schuster has been Mr. Woodward's publisher since his first book, and their success together has been extraordinary. All 20 of his titles have been Times best sellers, and 14 have reached No. 1. (Simon & Schuster published a book in 1992 by Mr. Woodward and David S. Broder about Dan Quayle, which would bring his tally to 21, but it was a compendium of work that had already appeared in The Washington Post.) Leonard Downie Jr., the former executive editor of The Washington Post, has known Mr. Woodward since they worked together on Watergate stories in the 1970s. He said that Mr. Woodward stood out at the newspaper for his tidy appearance. Newsrooms can be sloppy places, but Mr. Woodward was always neatly dressed. He was extremely polite, almost obsequious, Mr. Downie said, and he kept a toothbrush and toothpaste in his desk. Today, Mr. Woodward enjoys the luxury of time daily newspapering can prohibit, and he said he always tries to schedule at least four hours for interviews, which often take place over a meal or coffee at his house, where he has lived since 1976. But if a source is dodging his calls, he'll still show up on their doorstep -- he likes to joke that 8:17 p.m. is the best time to drop by. While he was writing a book about George W. Bush, Mr. Downie recalled, there was a general he wanted to talk to who had not responded to several attempts to contact him, so Mr. Woodward went to his house and knocked on his door after dinnertime. The general recognized him right away. ""Are you still doing this [expletive]?"" he asked. ""Bob said, 'Yes, and there's something I want to talk to you about.' The general was so nonplused he invited him in, and Bob was there for hours."" Another piece of Mr. Woodward's process is that he has all his interviews almost immediately transcribed. This has led to a trove of information -- he has decades' worth of transcripts that are typed out by his assistant, in addition to memos written before tape recorders were commonplace. He estimates he has 200 cardboard boxes, kept in temperature controlled storage, that are filled with records going back to when he worked for the Montgomery County Sentinel. His wife, Elsa Walsh -- who is also a journalist, and his first editor on all his books -- said that Mr. Woodward shares them with journalists he trusts. ""Bob has a really very interesting archive on Biden,"" Ms. Walsh said. She once came downstairs in the morning in her workout clothes to find two people in their living room.

""I was like, 'Bob, who is that?'"" she said. ""It was two reporters from the Post going through all the old Biden files. That's not uncommon."" After finishing ""Fear"" in 2018, Ms. Walsh said her husband was left deeply troubled about what might happen if a crisis erupted, and so he set out to write a book on Mr. Trump's approach to national security. Mr. Woodward wanted it to come out before the election, and had less than two years to do it. A quick turnaround, but he felt obligated, Ms. Walsh said. Then, Covid-19 happened, and in March, the country began to shut down. Just over two months before he turned it in, he tore the book in half, devoting about 40 percent of it to the pandemic. ""Sorry, buddy,"" Ms. Walsh recalled. ""You've got to write another book."" Mr. Woodward kept reporting until the last possible moment. At one point, the book recounts a phone call in which Mr. Trump talks about the election being 105 days away -- which was fewer than 60 days before ""Rage"" was released. Even as Mr. Woodward raced to complete the book, his editor at Simon & Schuster, Jonathan Karp, the company's chief executive, didn't know much about it. Mr. Woodward would call on a secure app from time to time to offer updates, but few details. Mr. Karp said he didn't really know what Mr. Woodward was writing until he turned it in. But given Mr. Woodward's track record for the company, Mr. Karp thought that was just fine. ""I have a saying around here: In Bob we trust,"" Mr. Karp said. ""So we drop what we're doing when Bob Woodward tells us he's ready to run.""","He has covered nine presidents over 50 years, making him perhaps the country's most enduring chronicler of the Oval Office.

Style,In the Autonomous Zones,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/style/autonomous-zone-anarchist-community.html,"Autonomous zones, protest camps and intentional communities alike thrive on hard work and consensus -- and can become disastrous rapidly.

At first they called it the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone. In early June, protesters aligned with the Black Lives Matter movement took over six city blocks of a gentrified Seattle neighborhood. There, activists screened films, served spaghetti, painted murals, held vigils and planted a community garden. Their demands, according to Dae Shik Kim Jr., 28, an organizer who lives in the neighborhood, are: Defund the Seattle Police Department by 50 percent, fund more social services in the city, and drop charges against all protesters. ""We firmly believe that the type of leverage that we have during this moment would not be made possible if it wasn't for the on-the-ground protesters who are there every night, putting that type of visible, strategic pressure on the city,"" Mr. Kim said. Jenny Durkan, the mayor of Seattle, initially praised the zone as ""predominantly peaceful,"" even while the idea of the area became a culture war punching bag for pundits and politicians.

""One simply wants to live differently within the parameters of what's possible,"" said Kristin Ross, a professor of comparative literature at New York University who wrote a book about the 1871 Paris Commune. ""It's about a strategy where you develop the institutions on your own,"" she said, the goal being to ""develop the collective capacity to take care of yourself."" The Paris Commune occurred in March of 1871 when left-wing Parisians expelled the French Army from the city and began a brief experiment in socialist rule. Their methods remain familiar: The Parisians famously toppled a statue of Napoleon in the Place Vendome. ""The people of Paris just kind of took over the mechanisms of the city and thought, 'We can run this better in our own interests,'"" a CHOP organizer told Roar Magazine. ""I see this as part of that tradition and a part of that lineage."" In that instance, the French Army responded; between 6,000 and 50,000 people died. That state response also has echoes today. ""There will never be an 'Autonomous Zone' in Washington D.C., as long as I'm your president,"" President Trump tweeted on June 23, after activists tried to set up the so-called Black House Autonomous Zone near the White House. ""If they try, they will be met with serious force!"" The term's meaning is slippery. ""Definitions are always contentious,"" said Timothy Miller, a professor of religious studies at the University of Kansas and author of ""Communes in America, 1975-2000."" ""Autonomous zones are really temporary, for the most part, and tend to be protest camps."" They're not intentional communities, or communes, Mr. Miller said: ""For me, an intentional community is a group of people gathered around a common purpose -- religious or social, typically -- with the intention of being there for the long term.""

Today there are hundreds of intentional communities in America listed on just one database, including farming-focused eco-villages and a ""dancing sanctuary"" for people with PTSD. Yet even these boundaries are porous. ""There are in-between cases that have features of intentional communities and temporary autonomous zones,"" Mr. Miller said. He pointed to Occupy Wall Street's 2011 encampment in Manhattan as one such example. The term ""temporary autonomous zone"" was popularized in 1991 by an anarchist theorist named Peter Lamborn Wilson, better known as Hakim Bey, who published a manifesto that cited a (possibly imaginary) 18th-century network of outlaw ""pirate utopias"" and the ""anarchist liberated zones"" from the cyberpunk author Bruce Sterling. Mr. Bey theorized that the internet would help bring about impermanent ""free enclaves"" where culture could spread outside of state control. (Mr. Bey's conception of anarchy estranged him from some others; he has published work in the journal of the NAMBLA, a group whose advocacy includes that sex between men and boys should be legal.) His theories prefigure the temporary enclaves that have bubbled up this month, even as they're snuffed out within weeks, days -- or even hours. ""Those are the best autonomous zones,"" said mIEKAL aND, 62, who founded a small rural Wisconsin anarchist community called Dreamtime Village with Lyx Ish in 1991. (Many self-identified anarchists change their names.) ""It doesn't have to keep fighting to do its thing, because it's already over. There's a beginning, a middle and an end.""

Dreamtime Village, which has sometimes billed itself as a Permanent Autonomous Zone, became a destination for nomads traveling America's back roads, he said. And, nearly three decades later, the community is still going strong. Asked what lessons activists elsewhere may learn from its longevity, he emphasized the value of consensus. Often, he said, the community draws people in their early 20s who are especially ""issue driven,"" whether they're militant vegans or animal rights activists. In order to prevent any individual from derailing important meetings, Dreamtime's self-governance requires ""consensus-minus-one, meaning that a single person can't block a decision-making process."" The Long Back and Forth of History Early in the morning of Jan. 5, 1969, a young Irish Republican named Liam Hillen painted the words ""You Are Now Entering Free Derry"" on the gable of an abandoned house in the Bogside neighborhood of Derry, his native city. Mr. Hillen spent the night at a protest (which was inspired by the American civil rights movement) and grew angry after watching police and loyalists beat Republicans with batons and rocks. Painting the sign was an act of resistance. ""What we were actually doing was just declaring: 'You are now entering Free Derry, pal, and this is us, and you are not in control,'"" Mr. Hillen said in 2009. That summer, locals erected barricades and pushed police and loyalists out of their neighborhood, in a clash known as the Battle of the Bogside. Residents of Free Derry organized their own security patrols and public transit. The barricades went up and down over the next few years. After a prolonged period, ""the British army were nipping at the edges of Free Derry and coming into it en masse in heavily armed patrols and armored vehicles,"" said Adrian Kerr, the manager of the Museum of Free Derry. ""This was two sides at war.""

In early 1972, British forces killed 14 unarmed civilians. The Bloody Sunday massacre transformed Free Derry into a global symbol of resistance. In 2010, the British government released the results of its inquiry into the killings and people in Gaza flew the Irish flag, Mr. Kerr recalled. And, this month in Seattle, someone set up a wooden sign in tribute to Derry, near the barricades: ""You Are Now Entering Free Cap Hill."" ""One of the criticisms that could be laid against the hard left is that they talk a good revolution -- they never do it,"" Mr. Kerr said. ""Autonomous zones are where people have actually got up and done something. It might not succeed. They might not last a long time. But it's not talking, it's action."" ""My advice for activists in Seattle is to know that we stand with you,"" Maeve McLaughlin, a Derry resident and former Sinn Fein assembly member, wrote in an email. ""Know that the eyes of the world is on you. Know that one of the key catalysts for the long campaign for justice for the murders on Bloody Sunday was that the world's media flashed images across the world of the denial of rights, of police brutality and ultimately of murder."" Perhaps the largest experiment in autonomy today is taking place in a sliver of land in northeastern Syria, where a collection of Kurdish-led militias have fought off ISIS, Turkey and Bashar al-Assad, the president of Syria. The autonomous region of Rojava follows the teachings of a revolutionary socialist named Abdullah Ocalan. It is ""often described as a paradigm based on three pillars: radical democracy, ecology and women's liberation,"" said Dilar Dirik, a Kurdish activist and researcher at the University of Oxford who has spent time in Rojava.

Rojava was born when a Kurdish militia captured a swath of territory during the Syrian Civil War. ""It's about not being like a state, because the state is seen by many autonomy struggles as actually a system of domination that controls people, rather than provides for them,"" Ms. Dirik said. Decision making in Rojava is also an exercise in consensus building. ""Raising one's hands to vote is less important than reaching an understanding,"" wrote Zelal Jeger, the co-chair of TEV-DEM, a political organization in Rojava, in response to questions sent through a representative. ""If we put something to a vote, and you receive more votes, and you win and I lose, fair enough -- we do it like this. But before we vote, we discuss for hours, until you and I reach a consensus. Then there won't be incorrect decisions."" Rojava has also discussed the future of policing. Communes have localized groups of rotating armed volunteers known as Civil Defense Forces. ""The logic is that it shouldn't be people from outside,"" Ms. Dirik said. Policing ""shouldn't be, like, 'Random people who don't know you just come and beat you up when you make a mistake.' When people know each other, they also understand what's going on in that community.""

Books,Random House Names a New Publisher and Hires a Top Editor From Knopf,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/18/books/random-house-andy-ward-robin-desser.html,"In a year already marked by turnover within publishing companies, Penguin Random House, the largest one in the United States, is further shuffling the decks. On Monday, the company announced that Andy Ward, who has edited books by writers such as David Mitchell, George Saunders and Imbolo Mbue, will become the executive vice president and publisher of Random House. Mr. Ward, a former magazine editor, joined Random House in 2009 as executive editor. He spent the last five years as Random House's editor in chief, and helped to shape best sellers like Paul Kalanithi's ""When Breath Becomes Air,"" Lena Dunham's ""Not That Kind of Girl"" and Ed Catmull's ""Creativity, Inc."" He will continue to acquire and edit new projects as publisher. ""Andy's dedication to our books and authors -- not to mention his passionate advocacy for our editors -- is central to who he is, and to how he will lead this group going forward,"" Gina Centrello, the president and publisher of Random House, wrote in a note to the staff announcing the change.

Mr. Ward will be ascending to the role previously held by Susan Kamil, who died in September from complications that arose from lung cancer. A beloved figure in the industry, her death left a vacuum at Random House, which is considered to be one of Penguin Random House's crown jewels. In her announcement, Ms. Centrello noted that Ms. Kamil had expressed her hope that Mr. Ward might one day take over her role.

Robin Desser, the editorial director of the Penguin Random House imprint Alfred A. Knopf, will fill Mr. Ward's role and become senior vice president and editor in chief of Random House. At Knopf, Ms. Desser was a tastemaker who acquired and edited works by best-selling and award-winning authors like Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie, Edwidge Danticat, Jhumpa Lahiri, Valeria Luiselli, Julia Phillips, Arundhati Roy, Jane Smiley, Patti Smith and Cheryl Strayed. In a note to staff, Sonny Mehta, Knopf's chairman and editor in chief, said that some of the books Ms. Desser edited are ""destined to become classics"" and praised her for ""the joy she takes at working in the editorial trenches."" The changes come during a period of rapid transformation at Penguin Random House, which has more than 275 imprints and is by far the biggest of the ""big five"" publishing companies in the United States. In the past year or so, a parade of high-profile editors have left Penguin Random House, among them Molly Stern, the publisher of Crown, who edited Michelle Obama's book; Julie Grau and Cindy Spiegel, who left the company when their influential imprint, Spiegel & Grau, was shut down; Maya Mavjee, the former president and publisher of Crown, who left Crown when the company decided to merge Random House and the Crown Publishing Group; and Anne Messitte, the former executive vice president of Knopf Doubleday and publisher of Vintage/Anchor, who departed after a restructuring. Ms. Messitte was known throughout the industry as a powerhouse who worked with authors like E L James, Dan Brown, Margaret Atwood, Toni Morrison and Haruki Murakami. All the churn seems to have done little to shake the company's dominant position within the industry. Penguin Random House has been on a growth spree: In May it acquired a 45 percent stake in Sourcebooks, an independent publishing company, and in March it acquired the children's publisher Little Tiger Group. It also bought two publishing companies based in Spain, a Spanish-language literary publisher named Ediciones Salamandra and a Catalan-language publisher, La Campana Llibres. Penguin Random House reported a 33 percent rise in profit for the first half of 2019 compared to the same period the previous year, a jump that was attributed to its acquisitions and a string of best sellers like Mrs. Obama's memoir and Delia Owens's novel ""Where the Crawdads Sing."" In November, the company said it would add a new distribution center in Reno, Nev., expanding its distribution capabilities on the West Coast.

The amount of turnover has been surprising for the publishing industry, where editors often spend years building up their rosters of authors, and writers often put clauses in their contracts allowing them to stick with a particular editor if he or she leaves the company. Other recent notable moves include Amy Einhorn, who left her position as publisher of Flatiron Books to become the president and publisher of Henry Holt, replacing the departing publisher Ben Schrank; Megan Lynch, who is filling the publisher's role at Flatiron and was previously the editorial director at HarperCollins's Ecco imprint; and Helen Atsma, who left Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, where she was the editorial director for fiction, to move to Ecco, where she will fill Ms. Lynch's role. It's unclear how the musical chairs will affect the authors who work with individual editors and often develop close professional and creative relationships with them. Overall, the publishing industry has been relatively stable as print sales have stabilized and digital audiobook sales continue to rise. For the first eight months of this year, trade publishers' revenues reached nearly $4.7 billion, an increase of more than 3 percent over the same period in 2018, according to the Association of American Publishers.

Music,Watch Ping-Pong Make Its New York Philharmonic Debut,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/19/arts/music/ping-pong-new-york-philharmonic-lunar-new-year-gala.html,"Two U.S. national table tennis champions play each other -- at the New York Philharmonic. The unique performance uses sounds from an intense match alongside a full symphony orchestra.

On a recent Sunday afternoon, the table tennis club Spin was full of New Yorkers hiding from the rain. Casual players fooling around and sipping drinks had no idea that, on the other side of a nearby curtain, two Olympic-level athletes were practicing for their New York Philharmonic debut. Michael Landers and Ariel Hsing, table tennis champions in their early 20s, are featured as the Ping-Pong-playing soloists in Andy Akiho's energetic concerto ""Ricochet,"" which will have its American premiere on Tuesday as part of the Philharmonic's Lunar New Year gala. And yes, this is the first time a Ping-Pong table has been onstage at David Geffen Hall. As staged in New York, the concerto will showcase two soloists -- a violinist, Elizabeth Zeltser of the Philharmonic, and a percussionist, David Cossin -- at the front of the stage. The Ping-Pong players are elevated at the back, like opera singers performing above an orchestra pit.

Separating the athlete-soloists from the rest of the ensemble is a tall net that protects the musicians (and the audience) from wayward balls. Not that there should be so many of those: The table-tennis parts, which sometimes involve playing with objects like wine glasses and drums in lieu of paddles, require no less skill than the ones for the traditional instruments. Summer-camp amateurs need not apply.

The Ping-Pong may seem like a gimmick, but there is meaning to be found in ""Ricochet"" -- especially as it will appear in a program of music from China, which has long been home to the world's greatest table tennis players. The piece conjures echoes of 1970s ""Ping-Pong diplomacy,"" with the violin part serving as an intermediary between the percussive soloists and the orchestra. But Mr. Akiho, an imaginative composer and percussionist known for playing the steel pan and found instruments, said his concerto shouldn't be taken too seriously. ""I'm not really a political kind of person,"" he said. ""This is bringing two cultures together, and bringing music and sports together for a nice conversation. But I also just want to create a good experience.""

Mr. Akiho was quick to add that he is not a Ping-Pong player himself. At a rehearsal on Saturday, Ms. Hsing was running late, so Mr. Akiho filled in. He had more laughs than successful shots. But it was at Spin, the Manhattan Ping-Pong club, where he first thought of writing ""Ricochet."" Ms. Zeltser said she was with him there in 2012, after one of the Philharmonic's Contact! new-music concerts that included Mr. Akiho's ""Oscillate."" Their conversation turned to music and, eventually Jean-Jacques Cesbron, Mr. Akiho's manager who oversaw the development of ""Ricochet,"" suggested that Mr. Akiho write a concerto inspired by percussive rhythms of the Ping-Pong games around them.

""Andy has an incredible ear,"" Ms. Zeltser said. ""He's always registering sound and using it in his music."" In Chinatown, where he lives, Mr. Akiho frequents shops with a tuning app on his phone and chopsticks, experimenting with the pitches of ceramic bowls and other ordinary objects. ""I'm more excited by pieces where you have to find instruments,"" he said. ""Ricochet"" came together after a series of workshops with Mr. Cossin, a veteran of the Bang on a Can All-Stars ensemble, to test the sounds of found materials. (Mr. Akiho said he likes tones ""that are super articulate, with a long resonance and a sharp attack."") The finished score contains an elaborate inventory and diagrams detailing what goes where, including liquor bottles, temple bowls and resonant metal pipes. The Ping-Pong players also make percussive sounds by dribbling the ball with a hand drum and, in the finale, dumping a container of balls on the table.

""I'm interested in any crazy, creative idea beyond normal imagination,"" he said. ""Classical music needs more like this."" Playing Ping-Pong with unconventional objects isn't new or especially challenging for Mr. Landers and Ms. Hsing, who said they have joked around in the past with even a small cellphone as an improvised paddle. Mr. Landers said that when he was 11, someone beat him playing with a Dr. Seuss book. For them, the difficulty is in playing with the rhythmic precision of the other musicians. In one moment, Mr. Landers lobs the ball high into the air. Once it bounces on Ms. Hsing's side, she hits it powerfully into a bass drum on the table. Each sound -- the ball hitting the paddles, table and drum -- must align with sforzando bursts from the orchestra.","Table-tennis-playing soloists swing paddles, hand drums, small gongs and even a wine glass in Andy Akiho's unconventional concerto, ""Ricochet.""",764900fb-7854-5a7c-9112-53e40a76fbc8,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/20/arts/20PINGPONG1/20PINGPONG1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=25ee5365c6b471208b7321d298ed054f9d871b5de460c19124fa3d663f756fcb&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Michael Landers and Ariel Hsing, two champion table tennis players, are soloists in ""Ricochet.""",764900fb-7854-5a7c-9112-53e40a76fbc8,N24News/imgs/764900fb-7854-5a7c-9112-53e40a76fbc8.jpg,12
Music,Priced Out of Classical Music? Try Concerts for $8.33,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/18/arts/music/peoples-symphony-concerts.html,"Frank Salomon has managed Peoples' Symphony Concerts, which fights the tide of rising ticket prices, for nearly half a century.





It is no secret that classical music faces strong headwinds, but one challenge has been reaching gale-force proportions in recent years: high ticket prices. The top ticket costs $495 at the Metropolitan Opera, $295 at Carnegie Hall and $165 at the New York Philharmonic. And while their average prices are much lower -- and each offers inexpensive, sometimes free outreach programs -- fans and newcomers can feel priced out of performances that often seem more like luxury goods than staples. All of which makes Peoples' Symphony Concerts a holdout -- one of the best deals in New York, a city not exactly known for bargains. The organization, which offers performances by some of the best artists in the world for as little as $8.33 a concert, will open its 120th season on Saturday evening with the Juilliard String Quartet playing Mozart, Britten and Brahms in the auditorium of Washington Irving High School in Manhattan.

""We're primarily able to do it due to the generosity of the musicians, who come and play for a fraction of their normal fees,"" said Frank Salomon, 83, who has managed the series for nearly half a century. ""The artists believe in the mission. And many say it's one of their favorite audiences anywhere in the world."" Founded during New York's earlier Gilded Age by Franz X. Arens, a conductor with a vision of making the finest music available to students, workers and immigrants, the series has continued to offer Rolex-quality performances at Timex prices.

By using less opulent venues (Washington Irving's auditorium has good acoustics, but hard wooden seats), forgoing advertising, and attracting philanthropy and well-timed bequests, Peoples' Symphony has been able to present an impressive roster of artists over the years, including Joshua Bell, Yefim Bronfman, the Emerson String Quartet, the Guarneri Quartet, Leonidas Kavakos, Gidon Kremer, Lang Lang and Radu Lupu. Everything is expensive in New York these days: rent, groceries, restaurants, taxis, movies, pop concerts, ball games. But rising costs pose a special threat to classical music, raising barriers at a fragile moment when the field must fight to keep existing fans and lure new ones.

Michael M. Kaiser, the former president of the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, said that after years of bumping up ticket prices to offset spiraling costs, many presenters were hitting a point of diminishing returns: Some people are deciding they cannot afford live performances and are opting instead for home entertainment alternatives. ""This is a problem in the field,"" said Mr. Kaiser, who is now the chairman of the DeVos Institute of Arts Management at the University of Maryland.

Peoples' Symphony Concerts have been aimed, from the start, at the 99 percent -- giving regular New Yorkers a chance to enjoy the best the city has to offer. This season is no exception. The great lieder singer Mark Padmore has performed Schubert's anguished ""Winterreise"" song cycle at Carnegie Hall and Lincoln Center, and has made more than one celebrated recording of it. This May he will sing it at Town Hall with the jazz pianist Ethan Iverson as the finale of a six-concert Peoples' Symphony series that can be bought for $80 (or $13.33 a concert) or $52 ($8.66 a concert). Other artists in the series include the pianist Benjamin Grosvenor and the violinist Augustin Hadelich, who appeared this month with the New York Philharmonic. Mr. Salomon, who is also an artist manager and a senior administrator at the Marlboro Music Festival in Vermont, said that he had been chasing Mr. Padmore since hearing his astonishing performance as the Evangelist in Bach's ""St. Matthew Passion"" with the Berlin Philharmonic at the Park Avenue Armory in 2014.

""He just blew me away, and I started lobbying to try to get him,"" Mr. Salomon said, recalling stalking Mr. Padmore in 2016, when the tenor received the vocalist of the year award from Musical America. ""And after five years of bugging him, we finally got him."" Mr. Padmore said that he had been intrigued by the organization's goal of making music affordable. ""I was really delighted to hear about it,"" Mr. Padmore said in a telephone interview, noting that he also serves as the artistic director of the St. Endellion summer festival in Britain, where artists donate their services to keep costs down. ""I think what they do with these concerts is completely admirable."" From the start, the concerts have drawn discerning audiences. A 1902 review in The New York Times of a program at Cooper Union, the series' first home, said that the audience's ""attention and manifest understanding are such as to put pretentious up-town audiences to shame."" The organization still draws engaged, knowledgeable crowds to hear its chamber music and recitals. The pianist Garrick Ohlsson, who has performed several times, said he had found the subscribers ""a passionate and well-informed audience -- and beautifully behaved."" In addition to the Town Hall series, Peoples' Symphony has two six-concert series at Washington Irving, which has general admission seating, and subscriptions cost $50 (or $8.33 a concert). Mr. Salomon said many subscribers arrive early to make sure they can get the best seats, or sit with large groups of friends or relatives. The slightly more expensive Town Hall series has assigned seats. To attract younger listeners, subscribers to any series can now bring up to two children for free, and $25 student passes allow access to all 18 concerts, which would let completists hear them for just $1.39 apiece.",Peoples' Symphony Concerts quietly offers Carnegie Hall-quality artists for less than a Manhattan movie ticket.

Books,By the Book: Abby Wambach,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/18/books/review/by-the-book-abby-wambach.html,"Are there books that inspire you as an athlete? Any sportswriters you especially respect?

When I read Andre Agassi's ""Open,"" it was the first time I witnessed an athlete admitting to humanity and mistakes. After I retired, I was struggling hard with addiction. I wanted to write about it honestly but I was afraid that it might ruin my legacy as a sports hero or stain the reputation of the National Team. The first time I met my wife, I told her about my conflict and she said: I don't know anything about the sports world, but here in the real world, we like real people. If you're honest and you learn from your struggle -- the world will love you more, not less. She and Agassi inspired me to write honestly in ""Forward."" I'm glad I did, because it freed me to begin to live one life instead of two. Shamelessness freed me.

What's the most interesting thing you've learned from a book lately?

""Good and Mad: The Revolutionary Power of Women's Anger,"" by Rebecca Traister, brought context to feelings I've had for a long time. During my soccer career, the difference between how the men's team and women's team were treated and paid was egregious. Even in years that the women brought in more revenue and bigger championships, the men were paid dramatically more. Because we are women, we were conditioned to just be grateful for the crumbs we were handed instead of demand what we deserved. When I read ""Good and Mad,"" it made me fully understand that neither my experience nor my anger was unique. I was just taking my place in a long legacy of women fed up with unequal treatment. It made me consider that my anger about injustice is nothing to be ashamed of, it's something to be harnessed to make change -- just as the brave women of the National Team are doing right now with their gender discrimination lawsuit.

What's the last book that made you laugh?

""I'm Judging You: The Do-Better Manual,"" by Luvvie Ajayi. I've known Luvvie for a few years now and it's important that we understand how unbelievably funny she is. She has the ability to write words that many of us think, but never say.

The last book that made you furious?

""Educated,"" by Tara Westover. What a beautifully written book. Westover is a genius. Maybe we all are until we get it indoctrinated out of us like Westover did. ""Educated"" made me think about how dangerous it is to tell a child who she is and what the world is instead of giving her space to discover both on her own.

What kind of reader were you as a child?

I never read as a child. I was confident on the field, but I was lost in the classroom. I avoided reading for much of my life because it brings back that insecurity. I watch my kids now and how they voraciously and joyfully inhale books and it makes me jealous. Although, it is true that I found my way to soccer because of a book. My sister Beth told my mom she wanted to learn to play soccer so my mom went to the library and checked out a book called ""How to Play Soccer.""

Television,"'Trust' Season 1, Episode 2 Recap: Don't Mess With Texas",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/01/arts/television/trust-recap-lone-star-fx.html,"If Episode 1 of ""Trust"" was an introduction to J. Paul Getty -- his disappointment in his children, his emotional repression, his lavish yet frugal life -- Episode 2 is a showcase of James Fletcher Chace (Brendan Fraser), the security specialist and former C.I.A. operative Getty sends to Rome to solve the kidnapping of his grandson in the summer of 1973. There's hardly a moment when Chace is not onscreen, so if you liked this episode, it's probably because you fell for Fraser's quirky depiction of him. Chace speaks with a Texas drawl, wears a cowboy hat, quotes fire-and-brimstone Bible verse and talks directly at the camera. The shift in tone between episodes is slightly jarring; Getty's Sutton Place was humorless and formal. Here, Chace is chatty as can be, very comfortable in his skin, and he slips in and out of being the omniscient narrator. It almost feels as if we're watching a whole different show. Luckily, it's so enjoyable to watch Fraser's fluid, goofy and sharp Chace as he butters up Roman bellboys, smooth talks a police chief and cracks jokes with old men playing cards in a piazza that the transition is relatively painless, and it isn't long before you've forgotten about Sutton Place altogether. The brash American meeting the old world Europe isn't a new conceit, but with Chace at the center of it, it's entertaining. This week's episode also introduces us to Paul's mom, Gail Getty (Hilary Swank), who learns from a gaggle of paparazzi and journalists waiting for her outside her home what ostensibly happened to her son. She has freshly returned from a camping trip with her other children, wearing sunglasses and a head scarf, but her visitors quickly yank her back into a harsher reality, which includes a sniveling husband, the actor Lang Jeffries (played by John Schwab). Gail is a straightforward, concerned mom, but she also shows an abundance of empathy for a son who doesn't have a great track record of staying out of trouble.

""Paul, he's been having a difficult time of late,"" Gail explains to Chace, who has just arrived in Rome on Getty's orders. ""But he's a gentle, kind kid. He's a bit of an idealist, you know?"" She's defending him against Lang, who displays no likable qualities and blames Paul's predicament on Paul himself. ""He's been kicked out of every school he's ever been to,"" Lang complains. ""Drinks, takes drugs, lives in a squat with God knows who."" (The answer is Paul's girlfriend, her twin sister and another drifter friend, Marcello.) Chace, noticing that Lang is critical of Paul's general existence, asks Gail if Lang might be behind Paul's disappearance. No, she responds: ""For one thing, he's not clever enough."" That's sufficient for Chace. They share a knowing look, and it's a nice little moment of candor and trust-building between them. But ultimately, Gail and Chace will diverge on how, exactly, the kidnapping did go down. In the final moments of Episode 1, it seemed very possible that the kidnapping was a hoax. (Paul places a sack over his own head as the men behind him wait, almost patiently.) The central line of inquiry in Episode 2 is whether the ploy was Paul's or he was really taken against his will. The investigation certainly seems to start under the assumption that the kidnapping was real, and rumor has it that the mob is involved. Through a tip from a bellboy -- whom Chace has a humorous relationship with, and plies with immense bribes -- Chace finds his way to a man we see in the very first scene, in Paul's squat, watching porn and trying to have Paul's girlfriend and her twin sister raped. He turns out to run a restaurant, where Paul's paintings hang all over the walls -- payment for meals when Paul didn't have money, the man tells Chace.

""He owed a lot of people money around here,"" says the man. ""I tell you one thing, Mr. Texas, if I saw him now, I'd kidnap the little bastard."" But when Chace offers him the briefcase stuffed with money in exchange for Paul's return, the man's cronies ultimately refuse it, telling Chace they're out of ""stock"" (Paul). Chace is back to Square 1. The situation appears to be a little more complicated than a mafia kidnapping. Chace eventually arrives at the same conclusion we've seen hinted at by the abduction scene in Episode 1: He discovers that Paul has been writing a movie involving a faked kidnapping, likely inspired by a scene in the 1972 movie ""Travels With My Aunt,"" which Paul had recently watched. He combines this clue with some further fishy details (the ransom note was plopped directly on Paul's bed, not delivered to the police; the timeline between the ransom note's appearance and Paul's last sighting don't line up; Paul's girlfriend and her sister show a surprising lack of concern) and becomes convinced that Paul has fixed the whole thing. Gail begs to differ. Her idealist son would not be capable of something like this. In a moment of desperation, before Chace leaves, she asks him what to do. ""Well, the good lord preaches forgiveness,"" he begins. ""But what that boy done to his mama? I'd whoop his ass."" This is peak Chace: Very Texan, Christian, straight to the point, and hard not to like. For the time being, Gail has to continue the investigation on her own. In the end, Chace morphs back into the omniscient narrator to close things out, reminding us what's at the root of this whole mess: money. ""Turns out a rich life is just as messed up as a poor life, just a different kind of messed up,"" he tells the camera. And this particular mess, he adds, is just getting started. The last image we see is of Paul, whimpering, chained up at the bottom of a pit.
* Paul's father, J. Paul Getty II (Michael Esper), who hadn't had much of a chance to shine yet, has one of the better emotional performances of Episode 2 as he sits at a bar, drunk, watching his dad explain in a news conference that he won't pay a single cent to the kidnappers. Talking to a woman he's hitting on, Paul Jr. says his father is the meanest man he's ever met. ""When you have everything you could ever dream of, what do you value?"" he asks her rhetorically, addressing the central crux of the show. ""Nothing,"" he whispers. It's the first time you have pity for him and the plague that is money in his own life.
* One of the episode's strangest scenes is a conversation between Gail and a live statue, who tells Gail near the show's end that he witnessed Paul being hooded and whisked away by men. This feels like a narrative stretch, but it's no more jarring than Fraser's breaking of the fourth wall.","James Fletcher Chase is in town to solve Paul's disappearance.

Sports,"In the Din of the Dome, the Rams Beat the Saints in Overtime",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/20/sports/football/nfl-playoffs-live-nfc-championship-rams-vs-saints.html,"In the Din of the Dome, the Rams Beat the Saints in Overtime

The triumphant locker room at the Super Dome started out so crowded Sunday night that personal space seemed like an extravagance. But as the room emptied, and the jubilant Los Angeles Rams continued a celebration that would rival any bacchanalia in this city's French Quarter, the player who helped preserve their season by blatantly breaking the rules stood in the middle of it all, still in full uniform, delighted to answer question after question about his fateful, and fortunate, moment. Amid the mayhem after a 26-23 overtime victory that propelled the Rams past the Saints and into the Super Bowl, that player, cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman, got his first look at the replay of his helmet-to-helmet, fourth-quarter thump on New Orleans receiver Tommylee Lewis. Peering at a reporter's cell phone, he could see himself slide into view and clobber Lewis before the pass arrived. For Robey-Coleman, it was just visual confirmation for what he already knew -- he had been guilty of pass interference on Lewis and somehow had gotten away with it.

The repercussions of that play will be felt everywhere from the league office, which acknowledged to New Orleans Coach Sean Payton afterward that the officiating crew botched the call, to this mystical city, which will now mourn a second consecutive infuriating exit from the postseason for their beloved Saints. Just 53 weeks ago, the Saints lost in the divisional round of the playoffs when Minnesota scored on a last-second, 61-yard touchdown -- nearly the same distance as Greg Zuerlein's 57-yard field goal that doomed them on Sunday. But in the giddy aftermath of Sunday's game, the missed call maybe resonated even deeper for a Los Angeles franchise that went 4-12 two seasons ago after relocating to Southern California from St. Louis and entrusted a 30-year-old coaching prodigy, Sean McVay, to return the Rams to prominence. And now, on the 39-year anniversary of their only Super Bowl appearance as a Los Angeles franchise, the Rams have advanced there for the second time. ""We walked into the interview saying, 'How on earth could we hire a 30-year-old? We walked out of the interview saying, 'How could we not hire Sean McVay?"" the Rams' chief operating officer, Kevin Demoff, said in recalling the decision to hire McVay. ""He's a great football coach,'' Demoff added. ""He's not a quarterback whisperer. He's not an offensive genius. Today he found a great way for our team to play complementary football. We kicked two field goals to go to the Super Bowl.""

In one night, the Rams vindicated two off-seasons' worth of bold personnel moves intended to turn a middling team from St. Louis into a champion in Los Angeles. Having pierced the aura of the Superdome, where Payton and quarterback Drew Brees had won their previous six playoff games, the Rams will now face New England on Feb. 3 in Atlanta. It is not a surprise that the Patriots - who also advanced with an overtime victory, by 37-31 at top-seeded Kansas City - will be there. They always are. But the Rams have gotten this far because, at bottom, every move they made after losing to Atlanta in the playoffs last year, all the off-season splurges and in-season roster churn, positioned them to thrive amid the jackhammer-in-your-ear din that they confronted on Sunday in the Superdome. ""We didn't feel pressure,"" said cornerback Aqib Talib, one of several new players on the Rams' revamped defense. ""We applied it."" This N.F.C. title-game matchup registered somewhere between sunrise and sunset on the inevitability scale. Since September, New Orleans and Los Angeles had jockeyed for the conference's top seed, with one coaching mastermind named Sean striving to duplicate the success of another. No other matchup embodied the season's offensive boom better than having the conference's most prolific teams -- who combined for 80 points in the Saints' Week 9 home victory over the Rams -- vying to outscore each other for a second time.

On Sunday, a full quarter elapsed before the Rams looked comfortable -- or, at least, they no longer looked sleeping-above-an-alligator-pit uncomfortable -- and then gradually, they chiseled away at the Saints' lead. They trailed by 13 after the first quarter but by just 3 at halftime and ultimately tied the score, at 20-20, on Zuerlein's 24-yarder with 5:03 left in the game. The other day in the Saints' cafeteria, Brees, newly 40, glanced up and saw himself on television. The channel was showing the N.F.C. championship game from 2010, the last time New Orleans played in the Super Bowl. His teammates ribbed him about all the hair he had nine years ago, all the hair he seems to have lost. Seizing the chance Sunday to lead them to another, Brees drove the Saints to the Rams' 13. On third-and-10, Lewis scooted out of the backfield and ran a wheel route. Brees saw him and released a pass down the near sideline -- the Saints' sideline -- toward Lewis, who was now inside the 5-yard line. The ball never reached him. Robey-Coleman made certain of that.

The officiating crew, which could have called any number of penalties on the play -- pass interference and unnecessary roughness among them -- opted to call none. The referee, Bill Vinovich, told a pool reporter that he ""personally"" had not seen what occurred. The Saints protested. Payton ranted and screamed. The public-address announcer admonished fans not to throw debris onto the field. Instead of scoring a touchdown or draining time off the clock, the Saints settled for Wil Lutz's 31-yard field goal that put them ahead by 23-20. ""It was simple: They blew the call,"" Payton said. For the Rams and for Jared Goff, the quarterback who blossomed under McVay's tutelage and became one of the best in the league, 101 seconds remained to tie or even win the game. Goff, who overcame a first-quarter interception to complete 25 of 40 passes for 297 yards and a touchdown, proceeded to direct the Rams into field-goal range, and Zuerlein equalized from 48 yards with just 15 seconds left in the fourth quarter. After winning the overtime coin toss, knowing that a touchdown would win the game but a field goal would return the ball to the Rams, New Orleans faced a 2nd-and-16 at its 34. Charging on a stunt, Rams linebacker Dante Fowler, acquired from Jacksonville by the trade deadline, reached Brees and hit him in the wrist as he threw, causing his pass to float. Safety John Johnson, defending Michael Thomas, watched the ball reach its apex from his back. He barely moved as he intercepted it. ""I saw it the whole way,"" Johnson said. ""I'm glad I got my contacts in. I probably would have dropped it if I didn't."" Goff ran back onto the field, the Rams with the ball at their own 46, five plays from deliverance, and General Manager Les Snead said it all felt akin to climbing the 18th green at Augusta National Golf Club. Demoff harked back to a conversation he had with Goff after that miserable 2016 season, when he lost all seven of his starts. Goff told him that he knew how to turn around the franchise since, he said, he had done it in college, at Berkeley. ""I know we're not that far,"" Goff told him at the time, and indeed the Rams weren't.

They won a second consecutive N.F.C. West title this season. They beat Dallas last week, and when Zuerlein went on to kick his 57-yarder, they had conquered New Orleans as well. The fact that the referees helped the Rams, too, won't make them any less proud. ""The referee made the call, we respect it,"" Robey-Coleman said. ""Now I'm going to the Super Bowl. Nobody can change that."" [The New England Patriots beat the Kansas City Chiefs, 37-31, in the A.F.C. championship game Sunday, and will face the winner of this game in the Super Bowl. See how they did it here.] Here's how the Rams beat the Saints: He's known as Greg the Leg for a reason. A 57-yard kick by Zuerlein has sent the Los Angeles Rams to the Super Bowl for the first time since 2001. What a turnaround by Goff and the Rams, who trailed by 13 in an incredibly loud and hostile stadium, and largely orchestrated that comeback without their Pro Bowl running back, Todd Gurley. And the most accurate quarterback in N.F.L. history is picked off in overtime. Brees's arm was hit as he threw, leaving a ball that hung in the air. Rams defender John Johnson came down with the interception as he was falling down on his back in Saints' territory. Los Angeles can now win it with a field goal. Hello, overtime. The Rams got down to the 31 yard line, but the Saints defense held firm, and a 48-yard field goal by Greg Zuerlein tied the game with 19 seconds left. The Saints elected to kneel it to send it to the extra period. But that no-call on the Lewis play on the last drive continues to look worse and worse. Saints Coach Sean Payton is still pleading his case to the referees and the fans are still booing. Hard to believe.

Saints settle for a field goal to take a 23-20 lead and give the Rams back the ball with 1 minute 41 seconds left and one timeout. But the Saints and the fans were upset that Rams cornerback Robey-Coleman hit Tommylee Lewis early on a pass out in the flat. Both players went up for the ball, but Coleman connected with Lewis before the ball touched him. Fans are booing and, from replay, it certainly looked like the flag should have been thrown there. That could have ended the game because the Saints could have run down the clock before kicking a field goal. Once again, an N.F.L. playoff game could be decided by the referees. You just knew the Saints were going to try to take a shot downfield at some point. They've been thriving on their usual mix of underneath passes and creative screens, but, with time ticking down to the two-minute warning, Brees finally uncorked a bomb to Ted Ginn Jr., who out-leaped the safety Lamarcus Joyner for the ball 43 yards downfield. The Saints are now in the red zone with three timeouts and less than two minutes left. After trailing 13-0, the Rams have climbed back to tie it with just about five minutes remaining. After starting the drive on their own 9-yard line, Goff drove his team all the way down the field, and a rush by C.J. Anderson was stopped on the 1-yard line. Rams Coach Sean McVay likes to be aggressive, but going for it on fourth down and passing up the chance to tie was a bit too risky even for him. So after a field goal, we are all even. That was a huge series for the Saints defense, which forced the Rams to punt from their own 12-yard line -- and just when the Rams looked to be seizing momentum (again). Add in a personal foul against the Rams on the punt, and the Saints will take over at the Rams' 46. Third Quarter: The Rams Are Not Done Rams continue to gash the Saints for big yardage plays, just as they did against the Dallas Cowboys last week. Brandin Cooks now has 100 yards receiving after a 25-yard catch and run. An end around by Josh Reynolds then went for 16 yards all the way to the 1-yard line, setting up a touchdown pass to Tyler Higbee to make it 20-17. After the score, Higbee immediately put his finger to his lips. Shhhhhhhh. (Don't think the Saints fans will listen, though).

First Quarter: A Little History for Drew Brees It did not take long for Drew Brees to make a little history. With his third completion of the Saints' opening drive, he passed the great Dan Marino for sixth on the all-time postseason completions list with 385. Incidentally, the Rams made an unusual decision to defer after winning the coin toss, giving the Saints the ball to start -- a small gamble when Brees is the opposing quarterback and this crowd is fired up. (The kids might refer to the Superdome as ""lit."") All things considered the Rams were fortunate to get off the field after giving up just a field goal. For a Trip to the Super Bowl The last time the Los Angeles Rams and New Orleans Saints met, they combined for 80 points and 970 yards of offense, and the Saints ended the Rams' dreams of going undefeated the entire season.

Global Business,Fast and Flawed Inspections of Factories Abroad,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/business/global/superficial-visits-and-trickery-undermine-foreign-factory-inspections.html,"Zaichun Ye, right, a consultant at Verite in China, seeing if a worker is wearing chain mail gloves at a textile factory in Yuhang in Zhejiang province.

Inspectors came and went from a Walmart-certified factory in Guangdong Province in China, approving its production of more than $2 million in specialty items that would land on Walmart's shelves in time for Christmas. But unknown to the inspectors, none of the playful items, including reindeer suits and Mrs. Claus dresses for dogs, that were supplied to Walmart had been manufactured at the factory. Instead, Chinese workers sewed the goods -- which had been ordered by the Quaker Pet Group, a company based in New Jersey -- at a rogue factory that had not gone through the certification process set by Walmart for labor, worker safety or quality, according to documents and interviews with officials involved. To receive approval for shipment to Walmart, a Quaker subcontractor just moved the items over to the approved factory, where they were presented to inspectors as though they had been stitched together there and never left the premises. Soon after the merchandise reached Walmart stores, it began falling apart. Fifteen hundred miles to the west, the Rosita Knitwear factory in northwestern Bangladesh -- which made sweaters for companies across Europe -- passed an inspection audit with high grades. A team of four monitors gave the factory hundreds of approving check marks. In all 12 major categories, including working hours, compensation, management practices and health and safety, the factory received the top grade of ""good."" ""Working Conditions -- No complaints from the workers,"" the auditors wrote.

In February 2012, 10 months after that inspection, Rosita's workers rampaged through the factory, vandalizing its machinery and accusing management of reneging on promised raises, bonuses and overtime pay. Some claimed that they had been sexually harassed or beaten by guards. Not a hint of those grievances was reported in the audit. As Western companies overwhelmingly turn to low-wage countries far away from corporate headquarters to produce cheap apparel, electronics and other goods, factory inspections have become a vital link in the supply chain of overseas production. An extensive examination by The New York Times reveals how the inspection system intended to protect workers and ensure manufacturing quality is riddled with flaws. The inspections are often so superficial that they omit the most fundamental workplace safeguards like fire escapes. And even when inspectors are tough, factory managers find ways to trick them and hide serious violations, like child labor or locked exit doors. Dangerous conditions cited in the audits frequently take months to correct, often with little enforcement or follow-through to guarantee compliance. Dara O'Rourke, a global supply chain expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said little had improved in 20 years of factory monitoring, especially with increased use of the cheaper ""check the box"" inspections at thousands of factories. ""The auditors are put under greater pressure on speed, and they're not able to keep up with what's really going on in the apparel industry,"" he said. ""We see factories and brands passing audits but failing the factories' workers."" Still, major companies including Walmart, Apple, Gap and Nike turn to monitoring not just to check that production is on time and of adequate quality, but also to project a corporate image that aims to assure consumers that they do not use Dickensian sweatshops. Moreover, Western companies now depend on inspectors to uncover hazardous work conditions, like faulty electrical wiring or blocked stairways, that have exposed some corporations to charges of irresponsibility and exploitation after factory disasters that killed hundreds of workers.

""We've been auditing factories in Bangladesh for 20 years, and I wonder: 'Why aren't these things changing? Why aren't things getting better?' "" said Rachelle Jackson, the director of sustainability and innovation at Arche Advisors, a monitoring group based in California. Even with American and European companies appointing executives this summer to put in place a stricter regimen of inspections and safeguards under the new agreements, these efforts are limited to Bangladesh. Other leading garment-producing nations, like China, Honduras, Indonesia, Pakistan and Vietnam, are not getting such stepped-up attention or expanded inspections. Thousands of factories in those countries will no doubt continue to be reviewed through the perfunctory ""check the box"" audits. Factory monitoring companies have established a booming business in the two decades since Gap, Nike, Walmart and others were tarnished by disclosures that their overseas factories employed underage workers and engaged in other abusive workplace practices. Each year, these monitoring companies assess more than 50,000 factories worldwide that employ millions of workers. Walmart alone commissioned more than 11,500 inspections last year. Spurred by heightened demand for monitoring, the share prices of three of the biggest publicly traded monitoring companies, SGS, Intertek and Bureau Veritas, have all increased about 50 percent from two years ago. The inspections carry enormous weight with factory owners, who stand to win or lose millions of dollars in orders depending on their ratings. With stakes so high, factory managers have been known to try to trick or cheat the auditors. Bribery offers are not unheard-of. Often notified beforehand about an inspector's visit, factory managers will unlock fire exit doors, unblock cluttered stairwells or tell underage child laborers not to show up at work that week. Unauthorized subcontracting, or farming work out, to an unapproved factory (as was the case for the Quaker Pet Group order in China), is ""very, very common,"" according to Gary Peck, founder and managing director of the S Group, a design and sourcing company based in Portland, Ore.

Though almost all retailers prohibit the practice in their contracts, suppliers still do it to save money, speed production and meet high-volume orders. And even inspections conducted at authorized factories can be deeply flawed. When NTD Apparel, a contractor for Walmart that is based in Montreal, hired a firm to inspect the Tazreen factory in Bangladesh before 112 workers died in a fire in November, the monitors' questionnaire asked whether the factory had the proper number of fire extinguishers and smoke detectors on each floor. But it did not call for checking whether the factory had fire escapes or enclosed, fireproof stairways, which safety experts say could have saved lives. ""If it's a check-the-box inspection, you better have the right boxes to look at,"" said Daniel Viederman, chief executive of Verite, a nonprofit monitoring group. Sajeev Jesudas, president of UL Verification Services, which conducted the Tazreen audit, said inspecting for fire escapes and fireproof stairways was ""the responsibility of the local building inspectors."" Bangladesh has been faulted for having far too few officials to inspect factories. Greg Gardner, the chief executive of Arche Advisors, said Western retailers and brands often seek different levels of audits. Some, like Levi's and Patagonia, want rigorous -- and costly -- audits, while others prefer limited, inexpensive audits that will not jeopardize relationships with favored suppliers.

In the Rosita case, after the workers went on their rampage, the Western companies that bought the factory's knitwear grew alarmed. So Rosita's owner, South Ocean, a conglomerate based in Hong Kong, commissioned a new inspection. That inspection, conducted by Verite, which is based in Massachusetts, was a scathing broadside. Verite's monitors found ""ongoing physical abuse"" and ""verbal and psychological harassment,"" with managers compelling workers who arrived late to stand for ""many hours without rest."" Verite's three-day inspection found errors in calculating wages, chemical containers labeled only in English and unreasonably high production quotas for which workers were disciplined or fired for not meeting. The inspectors noted that workers ""often face harsh treatment,"" including jeering from managers if they requested sick leave or annual leave. The monitors also found that managers had fired employees for missing work because of a death in the family and that security guards had beaten workers involved in union and protest activities. Mr. Viederman of Verite said the earlier inspection, performed by a major monitoring firm, SGS, demonstrated the shortcomings of checklist audits. The SGS inspection involved a one-day visit, largely seeking yes-no answers, probably for a modest fee. He noted that SGS had interviewed employees only inside the factory, where workers were often unlikely to speak candidly, and not outside -- for instance, at bus stops or at home, where workers might open up. Charles Kernaghan, executive director of the Institute for Global Labor and Human Rights, was shocked when he read the SGS inspection report for Rosita. ""The auditors were saying everything was in perfect order,"" he said. ""It shows how ineffective these monitoring organizations can be.""
* Open or closed on Thanksgiving? Here are stores' plans for Thursday and Friday. Effie Marinos, sustainability manager at SGS, defended her company's findings. She said SGS had followed the inspection protocol developed by the Business Social Compliance Initiative, a factory certification group for European businesses.

In mid-2011, the Quaker Pet Group, whose biggest customer was Walmart, began looking for cheaper factories where its trendy dog clothes could be made, according to a former Quaker employee who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal from Quaker. The company has also sold its goods to Petco, PetSmart and smaller retailers. Quaker settled on a plant called Jiutai Bag and Gift Factory in Dongguan, Guangdong. After visiting the site, Quaker's president, Neil Werde, sent a note to a Jiutai representative in June 2011. ""I was pleased with your factory,"" Mr. Werde wrote, according to an e-mail shared by the former employee. ""Good luck on the Walmart inspection."" That inspection did not occur. Quaker officials became concerned that Jiutai would not be able to pass an inspection, the former employee said. But there was a workaround. While Jiutai would make the garments, Quaker would fill out order forms to say that the items had been made by Ease Clever Plastic Manufactory, then an approved Walmart supplier. Ease Clever is an established manufacturer that ships products to Target and other large companies, according to the global trade database Panjiva. Jiutai, by contrast, had only one recent listing in the database, for a small shipment to Puerto Rico in 2011.

The stickiest issue was how to get the clothing made by Jiutai past Walmart inspectors. An inspection at Ease Clever was scheduled for September 2011, when the Walmart representatives would check that the dog outfits were being manufactured there, the former employee said. Jiutai simply took the clothes to Ease Clever, according to the former employee. Those moves were outlined in a later e-mail from a Jiutai representative to Mr. Werde. ""The Walmart inspectors showed up and said, 'Oh, they are being made here.' It's not as challenging as you would think,"" the former employee said. ""You have your finished-goods area and just show them the cartons being packed out."" In an e-mail to Mr. Werde, the Jiutai representative, identified as Mr. Hu, detailed how the setup had worked as he pushed Quaker for payment. In July, Mr. Hu wrote, a company based in Hong Kong called KYCE, apparently acting as a liaison, helped arrange an order for the Christmas dog clothes. ""JiuTai only make the clothes,"" Mr. Hu wrote. In September, ""we hang the clothes"" in display cases and ""send to Ease Clever warehouse for Walmart during inspection,"" Mr. Hu added, including photographs of the costumes. After the inspection, the clothes went back to Jiutai, and Jiutai, after making final adjustments, packed and delivered the clothes to the shipping terminal, Mr. Hu wrote. Mr. Hu and KYCE representatives did not respond to multiple e-mails seeking comment.

Contacted by telephone last month about the inspection and shipment, Jay Xie, a sales manager for Ease Clever, said the company had allowed the use of its Walmart certification. ""His factory had not yet been audited -- he used my factory because it was already audited,"" Mr. Xie said of the Jiutai factory manager. Mr. Xie said this had happened only once, as a friendly act to help a fellow manufacturer. The shipment, though, was late, according to the former employee and Mr. Hu's e-mail. And soon after Walmart started selling these items, Quaker began receiving complaints, according to the former employee. When Walmart conducted a quality test on the Mrs. Claus dress, it found holes, and the outfit failed the test. Walmart executives then summoned Quaker employees to its sourcing office in Shanghai for an explanation, but Quaker did not disclose the subcontracting to Walmart at that time, the former employee said. In March 2013, Walmart received a tip, via its global ethics hot line, about the unauthorized subcontracting and looked into it. Kevin Gardner, a spokesman for the company, confirmed that subcontracting in this case occurred in 2011, and that Walmart officials ""met with the supplier after the investigation to go through the findings and reinforce what our expectations are pursuant to subcontracting."" Even though Walmart was alerted to the case nearly two years after the products were made and only after a hot line tip, the retailer pointed to the episode as an example of how its investigation and compliance system was working, not faltering. ""We investigated. We talked with the supplier. We think this does show the processes were in place,"" Mr. Gardner said.

The experts provided real-life examples. To avoid appearing illegally overcrowded, one factory moved many machines into trucks parked outside during an inspection, a monitor said. Whenever inspectors showed up at certain plants in China, the loudspeakers began playing a certain song to signal that underage workers should run out the back door, according to several monitors. During inspections in India, some factories displayed elaborate charts detailing health and safety procedures that, like stage props, were transferred from one factory to another, another monitor said. For monitoring companies with major retailing clients, the auditing regimen can be nonstop. The territory itself is daunting -- 5,000 factories produce garments in Bangladesh alone. A retailer that uses 1,000 factories worldwide might want to pay no more than $1,000 an inspection -- that could mean a one-day, check-the-box audit -- instead of $5,000 for thorough, five-day inspections. That would cost $1 million instead of $5 million. ""You have this intense price pressure downward on these inspection firms, turning them into a commodity business,"" said Mr. O'Rourke of the University of California, Berkeley. Auret van Heerden, president and chief executive of the Fair Labor Association, a nonprofit group that Apple uses to monitor its Foxconn factories in China, said many inspectors were too rushed. ""Many are doing a factory a day, and many auditors, more than one factory a day,"" he said. ""They're on a plane and going to a new city the next day. They don't have much time to think about it or dwell on it."" Despite some improvements, many supply chain experts say monitoring has inherent shortcomings. Not long ago, Nike and other sporting goods companies were shaken by revelations that children, ages 5 to 14, toiled up to 11 hours a day making soccer balls for them in Sialkot, Pakistan. A study found that half of Pakistan's soccer ball workers were making less than the minimum wage, with many stitching the balls' panels together at home, making it hard for factory monitors to unearth such violations. Nike responded by requiring its main contractor there, Silver Star, to consolidate production in one big factory. Knowing how skilled many contractors have become at gaming the monitoring system, Nike took an unusual step and ordered Silver Star to set up a system of elected worker representatives who would be charged with speaking up about safety problems, wage violations or other issues.","While some audits are performed in depth, retailers often choose ""check the box"" inspections that fail to uncover substandard conditions and outright fraud.",8c75a2da-16bc-5353-a62c-0dcea01630c9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2013/09/02/business/jp-inspections-1/jp-inspections-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2013&h=383&w=600&s=f78e2a3e182b33e8229e49c98a191918d13debd080ad6d8a9c97c0620c7040b5&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Zaichun Ye, right, a consultant at Verité in China, seeing if a worker is wearing chain mail gloves at a textile factory in Yuhang in Zhejiang province.",8c75a2da-16bc-5353-a62c-0dcea01630c9,N24News/imgs/8c75a2da-16bc-5353-a62c-0dcea01630c9.jpg,24
Health,Shorter Stature May Pose Higher Risk of Heart Disease,https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/09/health/shorter-stature-may-pose-higher-risk-of-heart-disease.html,"To the surprise of researchers who had thought the very notion a joke, an international consortium of investigators reported on Wednesday that shorter stature increases the risk of heart disease. After gathering genetic data from nearly 200,000 men and women worldwide, the investigators found that each extra 2.5 inches of height brings a 13.5 percent reduction in heart disease risk. The relationship is present throughout the range of adult heights. A person who is five feet tall has a 30 percent greater chance of developing heart disease than someone who is 5 feet 6, said a lead author of the new study, Sir Nilesh Samani, a professor of cardiology at the University of Leicester in England. Of course, the increased risk pales in comparison to that caused by smoking, which elevates the odds of getting heart disease by 200 to 300 percent.

There is nothing people can do about their height, but the researchers hope the finding will lead to the discovery of new links to heart disease. The paper was published in The New England Journal of Medicine. No one was more surprised by the result than heart disease experts, although they have known about a purported association between height and heart disease for more than half a century. It was first pointed out in 1951 by Dr. Paul Dudley White, a cardiologist who was President Dwight D. Eisenhower's physician. He observed that 97 men and three women who had a heart attack before age 40 and were admitted to Massachusetts General Hospital were two inches shorter on average than 146 healthy men. Since then, experts have noted that shorter people are more likely to get heart disease in a variety of populations and ethnic groups, even after accounting for such risk factors as smoking and cholesterol, diabetes and obesity. But few researchers took the finding seriously. Height was just a marker for some other problem causing heart disease, most scientists said -- perhaps a poor diet, or infectious diseases in childhood that led to a lifelong weakness of the heart.

""This idea that shorter stature is associated with coronary artery disease is something we would laugh about,"" said Dr. Michael Lauer, director of cardiovascular sciences at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute. ""We would think about it as yet another example of epidemiology going amok."" Dr. Samani and his colleagues realized that if there was a real link, genetic variations that resulted in short stature would also result in a greater risk of heart disease. Previous research had identified 180 genetic variants that control height. To find out if those variants also affected heart disease risk, Dr. Samani and his colleagues examined the genetic profiles of more than 200,000 people whose DNA had been analyzed in a variety of other studies. People with the genetic variants were more prone to heart disease, the scientists found. But what was the connection? Did the genes controlling height also affect obesity, diabetes or blood pressure? Dr. Samani and his colleagues found just one link, and it was a very small one: The genetic variants associated with shorter stature also were linked to slightly higher levels of LDL, the form of cholesterol that increases heart disease risk, and to slightly higher levels of triglycerides, blood fats that are also a risk. But that was not enough to account for all of the increased risk, noted Dr. Sekar Kathiresan, an author of the paper and director of preventive cardiology at Massachusetts General Hospital. The rest, the researchers speculated, may come from poorly understood mechanisms, governed by height genes, that control the development of both blood vessels and bones. Not everyone is impressed by the new report. Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive of deCODE Genetics, said the increase in heart disease risk was real but so small as to be not very meaningful. ""It's a weak effect,"" he said.

Others, like Dr. Lauer, find the new report an exciting taste of the science to come. Until recently, heart disease research focused on factors that greatly increase risk, like cholesterol levels. Research into the genetic underpinnings of disease may point to more ""low-hanging fruit"" in ""other orchards we haven't seen,"" Dr. Lauer said. Studies of huge DNA databases, like the new research, show the power of genetics to resolve questions that had seemed unanswerable. ""The Achilles' heel of epidemiology has been the inability to distinguish between associations that are correlations and those that are causal,"" Dr. Lauer said. Until now, the only way to do that was through large, expensive and time-consuming randomized controlled clinical trials. For example, the Women's Health Initiative studied whether taking hormones after menopause could reduce the risk of heart disease, which seemed well established. Thousands of women were told to take hormones after menopause, or not to. After years of study and millions of dollars, the result was clear: The hormones did not protect against heart disease. Of course, no randomized trial can test whether height is linked to heart disease risk. But genetic variations are distributed at random in populations, and genes are not affected by lifestyle or environmental factors that have to be accounted for when researchers analyze data they get by simply observing populations. In a sense, Dr. Lauer said, we are nature's random experiments.","After gathering genetic data from nearly 200,000 people worldwide, researchers found that each extra 2.5 inches of height brings a 13.5 percent reduction in heart disease risk.",d3ad3a00-9307-519b-8fd0-606271909936,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/04/09/world/09HEIGHT/09HEIGHT-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=398c0b19824885828b07906cf1ab0aaa681230156138daeb62599b3ef7a5abb1&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Mayor Bill de Blasio, right, and Haim Korsia, France's chief rabbi, in New York in February.

Dance,"Review: For the Martha Graham Company, Opposites Attract",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/12/arts/dance/review-martha-graham-dance-company-city-center.html,"While this form-feeling tension is interesting to think about, ""Histoire"" enchants only fleetingly, mostly as it builds momentum toward the end, whisked along by the tango-inflected music. By that point the valiant central pair -- Laurel Dalley Smith and Ari Mayzick -- have joined with the work's three other couples in an onrush of turns, lifts and near-collisions that break through the stiffness of earlier sections. When the couples part, with the men and women exiting in opposite directions, they look past each other as if, for all they've been through, they haven't quite connected.

In a sense ""The Legend of Ten,"" to Brahms's Quintet in F minor, picked up where ""Histoire"" left off, with a breathy sweep that the 10 dancers maintained throughout -- but only after Mr. Lubovitch, whose own troupe turns 50 this year, received the 2018 Martha Graham Award. (The award, founded by Graham, was discontinued after her death in 1991 and reinstated this year.) ""Legend"" demonstrates the kind of playful energy and inventive mind needed to sustain a modern dance career for five decades.

The dancers seemed to still be settling into Mr. Lubovitch's fluid movement, which has a downward pull more buoyant than Graham's. In terms of technique, they were more in their element in ""Embattled Garden,"" which opened the program. Yet no matter how stunningly performed, and even with the refreshing addition of live music, this foray into the Garden of Eden with a cast of four and a vibrant Isamu Noguchi set feels stuck in a different time. The awkwardly paced effort to contextualize the work -- a video and slide show juxtaposing old and new versions, difficult to see under the still-dimming house lights -- didn't make it feel any more alive. The Graham repertory on other programs this season -- like ""Panorama"" and ""Chronicle,"" two pieces with more staying power -- may fare better.","Lucinda Childs's expanded ""Histoire,"" which had its premiere on Wednesday, is surprising not for how different it is from Graham, but for how alike.",b418cb68-bdc8-5f0e-a0fb-0be8775a7d58,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/13/arts/13marthagraham-3/13marthagraham-3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=549&w=1050&s=55eecfb64c5ccb78108e114e646b0deb7663bdde32472c17ff54ecdb99debca3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Laurel Dalley Smith and Ari Mayzick in Lucinda Childs's newly expanded ""Histoire,"" which had its premiere on Wednesday night with the Martha Graham Dance Company.",b418cb68-bdc8-5f0e-a0fb-0be8775a7d58,N24News/imgs/b418cb68-bdc8-5f0e-a0fb-0be8775a7d58.jpg,6
Sports,"With Football Returning, Big Ten Cities Brace for More Outbreaks",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/17/sports/ncaafootball/covid-big-ten-football-return.html,"MINNEAPOLIS -- To the Big Ten Conference's leaders and medical advisers, the announcement Wednesday that the league would play football this autumn was a scientific masterstroke and an athletic triumph. In some Big Ten cities, however, public health experts worried it could create an off-the-field epidemiological crisis. ""The Big Ten has come up with an excellent, safe plan for the actual football game, for the athletes, for the coaches,"" said Linda Vail, the health officer in Ingham County, Mich., which includes Michigan State University. ""The problem is the tailgating off campus, the large parties and all of that sort of stuff, and that is concerning -- deeply, deeply concerning."" More than 8,500 cases of the coronavirus have been reported at Big Ten universities over the course of the pandemic. Coupled with unnervingly large new outbreaks in some communities, the conference's decision to proceed with football has invited fresh rounds of questions in several college towns.

Public health officials around colleges beyond the Big Ten are harboring even more urgent worries as universities play games, or prepare to play in the coming weeks, sometimes with tens of thousands of fans in their stadiums. But within the Big Ten's footprint, ranging from rural Pennsylvania to major cities like Minneapolis, officials spent more than five weeks under the impression that they would not have to reckon with football and all of the chaos, sanctioned and not, that can come with every kickoff, touchdown, win and loss. Then came word of the unanimous vote among the league's chancellors and presidents to play football, reversing a decision made in August to postpone the season. They insist that their daily testing protocols for people within football programs are sufficient to control the virus. And they have established thresholds for when a team must stop practicing or competing, and students who test positive will be barred from playing for at least 21 days. Schools are also barring fans and on-campus tailgates. The Big Ten's plan, though, is focused on players, coaches and others affiliated with athletics -- a reflection of what university officials often believe is the proper role for a sports league -- not the wider student body, much less the wider community.
* None
* Week 11 Predictions: Here are our picks against the spread.
* N.F.L. Tightens Covid Protocols: As cases rise and Thanksgiving approaches, the league is requiring masks inside team facilities and increasing testing.
* The Packers' Defense Is Their M.V.P.: Green Bay's oft-overlooked defense has kept the team from falling out of the Super Bowl chase.
* The Long Path to the Super Bowl: With 18 weeks in the regular season and fewer teams earning byes in the playoffs, the Super Bowl is still a long way off.
* Playoff Simulator: Explore every team's path to the postseason, updated live. At Northwestern University, near Chicago, the athletic director offered little in the way of explanation when a reporter from The Daily Northwestern asked this week what he would tell students who would not receive the same level of testing as their peers on the football team. In Madison, Wis., where the denizens of the state capital ordinarily coexist happily with the University of Wisconsin, local politicians and public health officials were unsparing in their assessments of the season's potential consequences. They worried less about matters like testing access and more over how football could lead to new outbreaks; local health officials said Wednesday that 42 people directly tied to Wisconsin's football program had tested positive for the virus in recent months.

""While we all love our football Saturdays, the festivities that come with them are going to serve as new spreading events within our community,"" County Executive Joe Parisi of Dane County said in a statement. Mayor Satya Rhodes-Conway of Madison added: ""The increase in cases we are seeing is predominantly due to parties. Adding football parties into this mix is only going to make the situation worse."" Perhaps the sharpest criticism came from Janel Heinrich, the director of the public health department for Madison and Dane County, who said: ""We value people's health and lives over sports, and we hope that UW does as well."" University officials did not respond to requests for comment. In Michigan, Vail has watched her county's case toll swell since Michigan State students returned to campus, and she said she worried that football-related events could make a dangerous situation worse. ""Fans or no fans, at this moment we're not in a position to be able to have football games,"" she said on Thursday afternoon. She noted that conditions could improve between now and the weekend of Oct. 23, when the Big Ten hopes to start playing, but warned, ""If these metrics persist, then I'm going to have to make a statement that I cannot support Michigan State Spartan football in East Lansing."" A university spokesman, Dan Olsen, said in a statement that Michigan State would ""continue to work collaboratively with our partners at the city of East Lansing and Ingham County Health Department to ensure students and others are adhering to all public health and safety measures and hold accountable those who disregard these measures at the expense of the well-being of our community."" Many public health and policy experts said they understood the Big Ten's motives for trying to play: the cultural significance of college sports, particularly in the Midwest; rising confidence in virus testing; and, of course, the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from television rights and sponsorships.

""Big picture, I'm OK with the cautious approach to returning,"" said Ryan Demmer, an epidemiologist who is an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, even as he cautioned that the season's start would run at a risky parallel to the onset of flu season and colder temperatures in the Upper Midwest. ""It's just such a complicated balance and I have such mixed emotions about it,"" he said. ""It's hard to envision bringing football back when you can't have normal campus operations because the players are a part of the normal campus operations."" But others said that while the Big Ten's plan appeared promising, its capabilities would only be validated over the coming season. ""It'll be a tremendous challenge for teams to stay healthy and for student-athletes to stay healthy,"" said Simon Haeder, an assistant professor at Penn State who studies health policy. ""I wish everyone the best, and I hope it works out. But it doesn't take too much for it to not."" And leaders at smaller athletic programs will be watching closely. ""I'm happy they made that decision with safety in mind,"" said Donnie Brooks, the athletic director at Macalester College, near Minnesota's campus. ""As I read the protocols they put in place, it's actually giving us hope that maybe, just maybe, if they can do it and do it well, we can scale that plan in a way that works for us here in Division III."" But now officials -- at the Big Ten schools and in the communities -- are bracing for what could be an even more turbulent few months than they had anticipated. ""We have to start strategizing,"" Vail, the Michigan health official said, ""right now."" Talya Minsberg reported from Minneapolis and Alan Blinder from Atlanta.","Although the games will be played without spectators in the stadiums, some officials are concerned they will lead to more off-campus gatherings that could spread the virus.",ea6097f9-2f2d-52f3-8332-14a7e8db1af7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/17/sports/bigten-reax1/merlin_177180591_215a593b-53c2-4589-a487-4b90e3f2da86-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=5ac0125cda47b8e5cf2a9e08f044397bb979d2f2ac2596f1e1db1450415e07e6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Public health officials in Madison, Wis., have raised concerns about the return of football at Wisconsin even without fans in the stadium.",ea6097f9-2f2d-52f3-8332-14a7e8db1af7,N24News/imgs/ea6097f9-2f2d-52f3-8332-14a7e8db1af7.jpg,9

Now he's coming back with a new spin on his old sound.Credit...Clifford Prince King for The New York Times



Eddie Chacon's roller-coaster music career took him from obscurity to brief stardom. Now he's coming back with a new spin on his old sound.

The year was 1992, and a longhaired Eddie Chacon, in suspenders and big hoop earrings, grinned and posed alongside Charles Pettigrew in the video for ""Would I Lie to You?"" The duo took turns singing in silky falsetto -- the pop-soul song's memorable chorus is ""Look into my eyes, can't you see they're open wide?/Would I lie to you, baby, would I lie to you?"" -- and occasionally Chacon let out a triumphant, soaring ""Hoo!"" The track was a hit, but Charles & Eddie's fame was fleeting. Chacon ended up walking away from the music industry for three decades. ""I used to tell my wife, 'If I ever make a record again, I want to make a record you'd have to be my age to make,'"" Chacon said on a Zoom call from his home in Los Angeles. Now 56, his dark hair cut short and turned salt-and-pepper, he returns this week with ""Pleasure, Joy and Happiness,"" an album produced with John Carroll Kirby, a jack-of-all-trades songwriter and musician who has worked with a new generation of musicians drawing on soul: Frank Ocean, Solange, Blood Orange and Harry Styles.

Chacon's years away from music were filled with other creative pursuits, but songwriting has been a part of his life since he was 12, a Latino playing rock with two other teenage boys in his Castro Valley neighborhood in Northern California. His bandmates, Mike Bordin and Cliff Burton, went on to form Faith No More and Metallica. By 20, Chacon was working as a songwriter for CBS Songs, but he struck out cutting his own music. An album for Columbia was shelved and one for Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew fell through the cracks. Demos made with the production duo the Dust Brothers -- in demand thanks to successes with Tone-Loc, Young M.C. and the Beastie Boys -- didn't see release.

Josh Deutsch, a music executive who was then a young A&R rep at Capitol, recalled Chacon's talents. ""Eddie's full voice and falsetto had an Al Green thing,"" he said in an email interview. ""And with jet-black hair down to the middle of his back, he presented like a total star."" On the strength of the Dust Brothers demo, he signed Chacon to a deal in 1990. Then came an only-in-New-York twist of fate: One day, Chacon encountered Pettigrew, a singer from Philadelphia, on the C train. One of them was carrying a vinyl copy of Marvin Gaye's 1972 soundtrack ""Trouble Man,"" though Chacon can't recall who. Both of them were signed to Deutsch, but they didn't know it yet. And a musical partnership was born from that chance meeting; they even wrote a song about it, ""N.Y.C. (Can You Believe This City)?"" ""We started writing songs at lightning speed -- in the back of taxi cabs, laying on the floor in apartments, in bars on napkins,"" Chacon said.

Their debut, ""Duophonic,"" was released in 1992 at a time when artists like Lenny Kravitz, Terence Trent D'Arby and the Brand New Heavies were wedding soul music to hip-hop, rock and New Jack swing -- a sound that would later be labeled ""neo soul."" They struck gold immediately with ""Would I Lie to You?,"" an uplifting track powered by crisp snares, crunchy guitars and their own honeyed harmonies. It didn't break the Top 10 in the United States, but went to No. 1 on the British chart, and in 17 other countries. Follow-up singles scraped the bottom of the Top 40, but Charles & Eddie were one-hit wonders. (The song still has fans three decades on, with over 40 million YouTube plays. The EDM D.J. David Guetta rerecorded it in 2016.) By 1997, the label stopped taking the duo's calls, and it split amicably. Pettigrew toured with Tom Tom Club before succumbing to cancer in 2001. In the months before his death, ""we were back on the phone talking daily,"" Chacon said. ""We had even decided to make another record. He never told me he had cancer."" In the wake of their breakup, ""I was pretty lost,"" he added. ""I had a real identity crisis after it was over. I questioned my own validity as an artist."" Chacon turned his attention to work as a photographer and creative director: ""I left my recording studio one day and didn't turn it on for 10 years.""

Kirby, the producer, said he ""pictured Eddie as this guy looking down from his Spanish casita in Los Feliz, waiting for the right time to come back and make his statement."" A common friend suggested the two meet in 2018, and there was an immediate rapport. ""It's a very L.A. thing to sit in peoples' cars,"" Kirby said in a phone interview from Los Angeles. ""The first day we met, we just sat in his car for two hours listening to music and talking ideas.""

""Pleasure, Joy and Happiness"" blends Kirby's interest in hushed, contemplative music with Chacon's classic soul style. The album avoids the trappings of a throwback or revival of a bygone era, instead exploring the rarely glimpsed side of that genre's themes of passion and heartbreak, sung by a bruised but wiser man. ""Eddie was game to really reflect on his life instead of making fun sexy music to put on at a party,"" Kirby said. ""He was past it all. He had done it all. He's been screwed over, but he's really Zen about it. Eddie's strengths came from an authentic and honest way."" Chacon said he was interested in giving listeners an escape. ""It was a time where I felt sensory overload from social media and the news,"" he said. ""I wanted to make a record that was fresh and cool and very meditative. A record that people would listen to, and it would recharge peoples' batteries.""

Kirby sees a connection between current R&B stars like Ocean and Solange and an elder statesman like Chacon. ""All three of those artists are very good with not having too many rules,"" he said. He had Chacon record vocals the way he said Solange did on ""By the Time I Get Home"": ""On a Shure SM58 in the room, no booth, no headphones, just right there,"" Kirby explained. ""It adds a bit more immediacy."" For Chacon, it was the chance to put some of his hard-earned wisdom down on record. The single ""My Mind Is Out of Its Mind"" turns the well-worn theme of an anguished mind into an exploration of modern neuroses. On the hazy ballad ""Hurt,"" he revisited a chorus that had stuck with him for well over a decade: ""You were hurting yourself.""","As one-half of Charles & Eddie, he had an international hit with ""Would I Lie to You?"" Now he's releasing his first music in decades.",7f2ce127-361e-533a-9869-d79ca0a84c16,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/07/29/arts/28chacon1/28chacon1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=59d8d415118f2cd821853c98746499299899334adfe90cc89af80e6c24330928&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Eddie Chacon&rsquo;s roller-coaster music career took him from obscurity to brief stardom.

Style,Are Astronaut-Style Face Shields the Future of P.P.E.?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/05/style/are-astronaut-style-face-shields-the-future-of-ppe.html,"The BioVyzr, a pressurized, anti-fog face shield with two adjustable fans that run for up to eight hours on a single USB charge.





""If you have to sneeze, you're in trouble,"" Bill Johnson said of wearing the Air, an acrylic visor that evokes 1960s Soviet cosmonaut culture. Mr. Johnson, 44, a voice and video engineer in Utah, had tested an early model of the device on an airplane from Salt Lake City to Seattle to Ketchikan, Alaska, then on a three-hour ferry ride and a floatplane to reach his bush cabin. ""I flew with my older brother, and he couldn't have been any more embarrassed,"" he said. Most of the time, he didn't realize it was on, except when people started to stare. ""Kids would point and laugh,"" Mr. Johnson said. ""They were the most honest."" The Air, which features built-in HEPA filters, four hours of power on a lithium battery and a removable washable fabric, is one of the new space age-style wearables being marketed as the evolution of mask culture. There's also the BioVyzr, a pressurized, anti-fog face shield with two adjustable fans that run for up to eight hours on a single USB charge. The creators describe the device, which looks a bit like the weather shield of a baby carriage, as a new form of P.P.E.: a powered air-purifying respirator, or PAPR, which they say can remove as much as 95 percent of particulate matter, such as droplets and aerosols.

Mask mania has given way to a very experimental cottage industry. BioVyzr, which raised over $750,000 in May on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo, has sold more than 50,000 units to customers and wholesalers worldwide, totaling over $5 million in sales, according to Yezin Al-Qaysi, the 32-year-old C.E.O. of Vyzr Technologies. Shipping begins this week and will continue through October. Microclimate, the makers of Air, say they have sold 1,000 units at $199 each and will begin shipping them in mid-October. But with months of misinformation, politicization and downright confusion on just how to wear masks and which are best, many experts wonder: Are these futuristic creations credible? (To be clear, masks are very effective and save lives. People who don't wear masks put everyone else at risk.) Laurie Herzlin, 55, purchased two BioVyzrs, ""to get back out into the world again as I have been in isolation for 203 days now."" She is immunocompromised and had planned to wear the face shield on a flight from her home in Florida to visit her daughter in Toronto.

""Yes, people will stare. They might even take pictures and post them on social media. But I would be OK with that,"" Ms. Herzlin said. ""I just want to stay healthy."" After multiple emails and phone calls with Air Canada, providing them with photos of the BioVyzrs, which they requested, the airline refused to let her wear it on the plane. ""Air Canada finally came back with a generic response that cited 'safety concerns,'"" she said. A doctor in the airline's medical department told her the BioVyzr ""does not meet the description of permitted safety masks,"" a reasoning Ms. Herzlin called ""reckless."" (Air Canada declined to comment on the incident but said its mask policy follows the Canadian government's regulations.) Mr. Johnson said that between all his connecting flights en route to Alaska, only one T.S.A. agent made him take off his Air visor. ""I said to him, 'You're asking me to take my mask off, but you're letting everyone else keep their mask on,'"" he recalled. ""He had to tell somebody to take a mask off in a pandemic."" Once onboard, the Alaska Airlines crew was in awe: ""The pilot said 'I need one of those, how do I get one?' The flight attendants thought it was the coolest thing.""

But what about airflow -- and just how airtight are they? ""For any mask or fancy filter, one thing we need to keep in mind is how well they fit, tightly, to the face,"" said Chenyu Sun, an internist at Saint Joseph Hospital in Chicago who recently co-authored a study on face mask efficacy. Dr. Sun said health care workers often get specially fitted for N95 masks, and the one-size-fits-all approach of retailers is troubling. So is the lack of guidance for proper use. ""Inside out, upside down, probably even less people know how to take masks off properly without contamination. This also applies to these devices,"" said Dr. Sun, who added that sporting doomsday gear may have unintended psychological consequences. ""Will the general public really accept these? Now, even for regular masks, there is a lot of debate."" ""People double-take, but I think Canada is very polite so nobody stares too long,"" said Mr. Al-Qasi, who wears the BioVyzr around downtown Toronto, where the company is based. Raina MacIntyre, the head of the Kirby Institute's biosecurity research program at the University of New South Wales and the lead author on a recent face mask review, warns that if these masks don't ""provide a perfect seal on all contact surfaces, unfiltered air will flow preferentially through the gaps. HEPA filters are good for filtering pathogens, but these devices need to be tested for fit and filtration."" She added: ""The reason for needing a perfect seal is to force the air through the filter."" Real efficacy, she said, means approval by the F.D.A. and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, the agency that regulates this form of powered air respirator. ""The virus is present in aerosols, so such a device will not be protective.""

The makers of the iSphere and the Air say they have no plans to test with either agency. Mr. Al-Qaysi said BioVyzr's first model was not approved by an outside body, but that the company is ""working to make sure future models are NIOSH approved."" Yena Young, a creator of the iSphere who goes by the alter ego ""Ms. Bubble,"" calls her work more art than innovation. ""iSphere has no medical evidence and we do not think that it is better than N95 masks,"" she said. ""But surely it opens up discussions about our perspectives, confusion from the lack of scientific knowledge, misunderstanding in greeting gestures, fear about covering faces, fear of others, the need of a transparent identity."" David R. Hall, the chairman of Microclimate, which makes the Air, said the company is ""still doing tests to verify our thesis that sealing at the neck is better than on the face."" ""The question of mask efficacy is a difficult one and very much dependent on the mask design and materials,"" said Martin Fischer, a Duke University chemist. ""I am not aware of any studies comparing HEPA-filtration masks and conventional cloth masks."" While masks play a role in communication and expression, eye-popping products create false security, said Dr. Sun, who emphasizes continued need for affordable P.P.E., distancing and basic hygiene. ""A simple cloth covering, surgical or cloth mask, will be more than adequate for most people,"" said Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco.

Beyond wild stares, futuristic masks ""offer no further advantage,"" he said. ""There is absolutely no peer-reviewed literature or regulatory organization who has rigorously reviewed these data and certified it for occupational P.P.E."" There is also new evidence that plastic coverings may not be as good as advertised. In late September, Japanese researchers reported that face masks provide effective protection and that nonwoven fabric masks block the most droplets from a cough. Plastic face shields are not very effective at protecting others, they found; they may protect a wearer against droplets from others, but not the other way around. Dr. Chin-Hong, who calls the new wave of designs exciting but unproven, said the focus should be ""getting folks to wear any facial covering that provides a good fit and are comfortable rather than fussing about new devices.""","They may look high-tech, but so far there's no evidence these devices are more effective than face masks.",19d608fb-dba3-5898-98e9-5f440217a4f9,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/10/11/style/05BUBBLE-BOY2/05BUBBLE-BOY2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=88494d4d2a087300cbbc53ba2aa5b307e478dc88d9ebb031511765dfb635055b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The Air, which features built-in HEPA filters, four hours of power on a lithium battery and a removable washable fabric.",19d608fb-dba3-5898-98e9-5f440217a4f9,N24News/imgs/19d608fb-dba3-5898-98e9-5f440217a4f9.jpg,15
Opinion,Trump's Nakedly Political Pandemic Pivot,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/26/opinion/trump-coronavirus-convention.html,"After mocking people for wearing masks, refusing to publicly wear one himself and holding rallies and gatherings where social distancing was not required, President Trump has shifted his tone. He has canceled his convention activities in Jacksonville, Fla., after moving the events from North Carolina when that state's governor raised public health concerns about such a large indoor gathering. He has resumed briefings, ostensibly about the coronavirus, after canceling them and trying to move on to other matters, as if the virus would simply vanish if he sufficiently ignored it. Trump is in real trouble. With the election passing the 100-day-away milestone, he is down in the polls, people don't trust or approve of his handling of the pandemic and he faces a real uphill battle to re-election.

Apparently, the reality of his dire straits has begun to pierce his inner circle of perpetual affirmation. There is a reality lurking that can't be lied away. If the election were held today, he wouldn't win. But Trump is a political chameleon: He can alter himself to suit his environment, to reflect it. He may not be fond of apologies, but he is open to course reversal, for survival. Indeed, that is the maleficent marvel of it all: He has changed his position to the opposite of what it once was and argued that the new direction is the one he's always embraced. Only a person with an utter contempt for the truth could repeatedly take this tack. We need look no further than 2016 to see how Trump operates when he is desperate and in trouble, trying to woo the votes he needs, and how hollow and nakedly political his efforts can be. In 2016, after calling Mexican immigrants drug dealers and rapists and promising to build a wall between the United States and Mexico -- one that he would somehow force the Mexican government to finance -- he posed with taco bowls on Cinco De Mayo and wrote on Twitter: ""I love Hispanics!""

He got over a quarter of the Hispanic vote, yet once elected, he continued to demonize immigrants and tried to dismantle the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program for young immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" His administration's negligence and lack of preparedness in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria undoubtedly led to more deaths than there would have been under a competent president. And the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" policy, under which thousands of migrant children, sometimes infants, were taken from their parents, flourished. In 2016, when the ""Access Hollywood"" tape on which Trump is heard bragging about sexually assaulting women was made public, he issued a rare half-apology, saying, ""I've said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them."" He would later deem his assault claims ""locker room talk."" But shortly after winning the election he started suggesting that the voice on the tape wasn't his, and after his inauguration, according to The New York Times, he told a Republican senator that ""he wanted to investigate the recording that had him boasting about grabbing women's genitals."" In 2016, Trump finally admitted that Barack Obama was born in the United States. It is important to note that he didn't in fact apologize for years of racist birtherism during which he insisted otherwise. Instead, he once again attempted to shift blame, saying: ""Hillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it. I finished it. You know what I mean."" But after Trump was elected he revived his questioning of Obama's place of birth and the authenticity of his birth certificate.

Trump is an incendiary figure. He uses fear and division as his devices. He believes they work ... until they don't. When forced -- by shifts in sentiment by his core supporters, or those on the margins he needs, or in the face of possible loss and defeat -- he will say and do whatever it takes to get back in the good. But none of the change is ever real. This man doesn't evolve. He doesn't grow. He doesn't grow up. He is stuck and stunted. He is a creature of instinct and that instinct is base and animalistic, survival-centered, without core conviction of a prevailing character. The way Trump handled -- and failed to handle -- the pandemic in its early months no doubt led to the deaths of people who should not have died. He was thinking of himself, his political prospects, and nothing else. Now, his calculus has finally shifted: It's hurting him more to ignore the virus than to engage it. So he has done a 180 and now wants to pretend to be in charge, mature and not completely dismissive of the science that could save us. But even now, this is not about the American people but about politics. Should he prevail in November, the true Trump will no doubt re-emerge.

Science,NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope Ends 16-Year Mission of Discovery,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/30/science/nasa-spitzer-space-telescope.html,"Credit...NASA/JPL





On Thursday, NASA's Spitzer space telescope signed off and went silent. But even during its final week of operation, the spacecraft was making one-of-a-kind observations. The telescope, the size of a family sedan, follows Earth in its orbit around the sun, but trails 158 million miles behind. Lately, it has gazed out with its infrared eyes, taking sensitive measurements of fine cosmic dust that pervades the space between planets in the solar system. The resulting imagery will enable researchers to better understand our local celestial neighborhood, while informing models of worlds circling other stars and giving insight into the early universe. Since it launched on Aug. 25, 2003, Spitzer has provided unique contributions to science. It gave us new views of distant galaxies, newborn stars and nearby exoplanets, as well as of asteroids, comets and other objects in our solar system. Its infrared cameras have observed the universe in a light imperceptible to human senses, providing otherwise unattainable visions of the sky. ""There is no field of investigation that has not been touched by Spitzer,"" said Daniela Calzetti, an astronomer at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who has used the telescope to study galactic evolution.

Among the highlights of Spitzer's 16-plus years of discovery:
* None Determining the point in cosmic history -- 10 billion years ago -- when star formation peaked;
* None And, as part of its most famous finding, discovering four of the seven Earth-size planets spinning close around the star known as Trappist-1. ""It's really the end of an era, particularly for me,"" said Heather Knutson, an astrophysicist at the California Institute of Technology who, as a graduate student, used the telescope to map high-speed winds on a hot Jupiter-size exoplanet. ""Spitzer has been around for as long as I've been doing science. I don't remember a time without it.""

The end of a spacecraft's mission always provides a moment for reflection. But Spitzer's conclusion is particularly challenging for infrared astronomers, and many wish it wasn't yet time to say goodbye. ""From a purely technical point of view, we could continue to operate it,"" said George Helou, also an astronomer Caltech who was part of a NASA review into whether the telescope should continue to operate. ""The decision was taken at a time when it seemed the rational thing to do was to terminate the mission now.""

The telescope has been part of NASA's Great Observatories program, which includes the well-known Hubble Space Telescope, the still-orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory and the retired Compton Gamma Ray Observatory. Although Spitzer's components are aging, some scientists have suggested that the observatory is in overall great condition and that it could be kept around for at least another year. The decision to shutter Spitzer was first made in 2016, when NASA assessed the scientific output versus the cost of its various undertakings. The telescope was ranked near the bottom of this review. Administrators resolved to conclude the spacecraft's mission in 2019, around a year after the giant James Webb Space Telescope, which will be capable of infrared observations, was set to launch. But technological issues have repeatedly delayed Webb, whose current launch date is March 2021, although it could face further postponement. In response, Spitzer received an extension to January 2020. Nevertheless, NASA declined to extend it further, citing the complexity of communicating with the spacecraft. That will leave a gap should a heavenly event occur that would benefit from Spitzer's superior, spaced-based infrared eyes.

Spitzer costs the agency NASA less than $14 million each year, and its overall lifetime expenditure has been calculated to be around $1.3 billion, a bargain relative to Hubble's estimated $8 billion cumulative cost. Information from the infrared telescope has been used in more than 8,700 research papers and, adjusted for scientific impact per year of operation, Spitzer stands head and shoulders above other space telescopes. ""I like to think of Spitzer as the little engine that could,"" said Nikole Lewis, an astrophysicist at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.

During its career, the telescope continually exceeded expectations. Its initial mission, which required liquid helium coolant to keep its mirrors at a frigid -459 degrees Fahrenheit, was supposed to last two and a half years. But clever engineering practices stretched this out to five and a half years. Although the refrigerant ran out in 2009, operators found ingenious ways to keep using two of its three cameras and continue the mission. But now Spitzer's position in space is getting the better of it. The spacecraft was placed far from our planet so that Earth's heat wouldn't interfere with its observations. But, as time goes on, it drifts ever farther away. To talk to controllers at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., Spitzer has to tilt and point its antenna, preventing some solar energy collection and exposing its bottom to the sun, which causes distortions in its images. At some point in the near future, the geometry of the sun, Earth and telescope will make communication and management of the observatory too difficult, said Paul Hertz, NASA's astrophysics division director. The spacecraft's operators on Earth downloaded leftover science and engineering data from the observatory, then transmitted their final shutdown commands just before 5 p.m. Eastern time on Thursday. About 15 minutes later, according to NASA, the commands reached the probe and put it into hibernation, or safe mode, which was confirmed at 5:30 p.m. ""Everyone who has worked on this mission should be extremely proud today,"" said Joseph Hunt, the Spitzer project manager. ""There are literally hundreds of people who contributed directly to Spitzer's success, and thousands who used its scientific capabilities to explore the universe."" The special controlling hardware in Pasadena will be dismantled, making it unlikely Spitzer will ever be roused again.","NASA's Spitzer space telescope spotted 7 Earth-size worlds orbiting another star, a new ring around Saturn and many more wonders in space.",9a808129-1a0a-529d-ae55-a38cf21fdf97,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/02/04/science/30SCI-SPITZER1c/30SCI-SPITZER1c-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2020&h=549&w=1050&s=7d087d2364803488de11d1d658cbc908336848bac7d66e244ab2da872973df93&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"An infrared image of Messier 101, or the Pinwheel Galaxy, which is 170,000 light-years across and twice the diameter of the Milky Way, captured by the Spitzer Space Telescope in 2008.",9a808129-1a0a-529d-ae55-a38cf21fdf97,N24News/imgs/9a808129-1a0a-529d-ae55-a38cf21fdf97.jpg,2
Opinion,How Much of Harvard's $40 Billion Endowment Is Invested in Fossil Fuels?,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/29/opinion/harvard-divestment-fossil-fuels.html,"Ms. Lockwood, a member of the Harvard class of 2014, is a fellow in the Times Opinion section.





In my senior year at Harvard, I was invited to a dinner in honor of the writer Margaret Atwood, the recipient of the 2014 Harvard Arts Medal. On my way out the door I lingered, shrugged on my coat, took a deep breath and walked up to the university's president at the time, Drew Gilpin Faust. We had met twice: once during her office hours and at an ice cream social. ""Please divest from fossil fuels,"" I said, hoping to catch her off guard. The president, at first seemingly happy to see me, rearranged her face. Her shoulders crept up toward her ears. ""You students don't understand investments,"" she said. Then she walked out of the room. I have benefited immeasurably from Harvard's investments in me. But recognizing where some of Harvard's $40 billion endowment is invested was a cause of growing unease for me and some of my classmates. Students at other campuses were similarly concerned about the endowments of their schools. Figuring out exactly how much of Harvard's endowment is invested in oil, gas and coal companies is a near-impossible task. Harvard is required to disclose only direct investments in which the university owns shares of a specific company.

Harvard says its direct investments amounted to $394 million as of May 2019, or roughly 1 percent of the endowment total. Divest Harvard, a student group, determined that of that approximate amount, $5.6 million was invested in companies that produce or own reserves of oil, natural gas and coal, and large electric utilities powered by natural gas and coal. Harvard doesn't comment on its individual investments. But in 2015, the South Pole Group, a carbon finance consultant in Zurich, analyzed $989 million of Harvard's then $36.4 billion endowment at the request of Divest Harvard and 350.org. Based on those investments, the group estimated that the overall endowment was responsible for annual emissions of 11 million tons of carbon dioxide, roughly equivalent to the annual emissions from Delaware. It's easy to get bogged down in the numbers, but the exact amount of Harvard's fossil fuel investments or the emissions it is responsible for isn't all that important. As the world faces a climate crisis, any amount of investment in companies that extract or burn fossil fuels is too much, especially by one of the world's leading universities. Lawrence Bacow, the university's current president, explained in the Harvard Gazette last fall that rather than divest, the university believes that ""engaging with industry to confront the challenge of climate change is ultimately a sounder and more effective approach for our university."" But many students have not been content with that approach. As part of a divestment campaign, in May 2014 an undergraduate, Brett Roche, was arrested by Harvard University police for blocking an entrance to Massachusetts Hall, where President Faust and members of the administration had their offices. In April 2015, during Harvard Heat Week, students, faculty, alumni and community members blockaded President Faust's office once more. Last November, at the Harvard-Yale football game, climate change protesters stormed the field at half time, delaying the game for roughly an hour. To date, 532 faculty members have signed a petition in favor of divestment from fossil fuels.

This is not just about Harvard. And it's also not just about whether you think divestment is a strategy that is worth pursuing, or whether it has an impact. Rather, Harvard Forward is a model for building power by young people -- of breaking the logjam within large institutions and making change happen. This approach is not new. From 1985 to 1991, Harvard and Radcliffe Alumni/ae Against Apartheid campaigned for Harvard to divest its stock in companies operating in South Africa. The organization used the same nominate-by-petition system to elect four members to the board, including Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who stated that he would return his honorary degree unless Harvard divested entirely from South Africa. By the 1980s, Harvard did. Younger alumni realized then that they needed a seat at the decision making table to create change. That is exactly what Harvard Forward is seeking. On Jan. 15, Harvard Global Networking Night, over 100 volunteers for Harvard Forward -- many of them alumni from the 1960s, '70s and '80s -- attended 50 alumni events in 20 states and 20 countries with petitions in hand. That night alone, they gathered over 1,000 signatures. Alumni can submit petitions to nominate the younger slate of candidates until the deadline on Saturday at 5 p.m. Harvard Forward has volunteers in 35 cities to collect forms at signature parties this week. ""A lot of people want to know how they can make an impact when it comes to climate,"" Ms. Strasburger told me. ""If you have a chance to influence a $40 billion endowment, that's a pretty big deal.""",It's not all that important. Any amount is too much.,c4320133-81a1-5bc2-9d13-5c12af783f83,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/01/28/opinion/28harvard_divestment/28harvard_divestment-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=fc8106ea23901dc415065a3d2d6c20db2f35e565ced01e49a1b48b10912ba431&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,,c4320133-81a1-5bc2-9d13-5c12af783f83,N24News/imgs/c4320133-81a1-5bc2-9d13-5c12af783f83.jpg,11
Theater,5 Must-See Shows in New York This Month,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/02/theater/5-must-see-shows-in-new-york-this-month.html,"No matter what T. S. Eliot said, February is if not the cruelest month, certainly the bleakest. Which makes the bright blaze of new theater offerings in New York all the more welcome. Those setting fire to stages in Manhattan and Brooklyn include a divinely demented silent screen star, a pointillist painter, a saint at the stake and, oh yes, Everybody.

Rejoice, all you little people out there in the dark. The very greatest of screen queens (well, at least according to her) is back on Broadway, dressed to kill in every sense of the term. Glenn Close is reprising the role for which she won a Tony in 1995: the silent screen diva Norma Desmond, in this Andrew Lloyd Webber poperetta adaptation of Billy Wilder's deepest noir movie about movies. Staged to hosannas in London last year, this latest, streamlined version, directed by Lonny Price, may be lighter on stage spectacle than the original. But rest assured that as channeled by Ms. Close, who is backed by a 40-piece orchestra, Miss Desmond's ego will be as supersize as ever.

'Sunday in the Park With George' And he can sing, too! The multifarious movie actor Jake Gyllenhaal dazzled a connoisseur crowd at City Center last fall with his surprisingly sophisticated vocal chops in a concert version of this Stephen Sondheim and James Lapine Pulitzer Prize-winning musical about the pointillist Georges Seurat. That enchanted three-night performance seemed destined to disappear into the sentimental mists of theater memory. Now Mr. Gyllenhaal (as M. Seurat and his 20th-century namesake) and Annaleigh Ashford (as his muse for all seasons) are back for a limited Broadway run, demonstrating the pleasures of discovering that art isn't easy.

No one does the apocalypse like the great British dramatist Caryl Churchill (""The Skriker,"" ""Far Away""). Anyone who's feeling the world is headed to hell (and I'm assuming that's a fair number of you) will find unexpectedly energizing confirmation of their worst fears in this succinct, double-layered Churchill drama, which I haven't stopped thinking about since I saw it in London a year ago. Directed by James Macdonald and featuring an all-female cast portraying middle-aged kibitzers on the pageant of life, present and future, this play -- which opens Feb. 15 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music -- packs a millennium's worth of cosmic anxiety into a fleet 55 minutes.

'Joan of Arc: Into the Fire' The voices that France's favorite sainted soldier so famously heard are guaranteed to sound brand-new in this electric-rock reimagining of her road to martyrdom. The composer, after all, is David Byrne, the former Talking Head whose inspired bio-musical ""Here Lies Love"" set the rise and fall of Imelda Marcos to a disco beat. ""Joan"" felicitously reunites Mr. Byrne with his director on that production, the ferociously inventive Alex Timbers.

Few playwrights have wrestled as daringly with 21st-century questions of identity -- ethnic, societal, existential -- as Branden Jacobs-Jenkins (""An Octoroon,"" ""Gloria""). So his take on the seminal identity play in the Western canon, ""Everyman,"" is sure to be fascinating, challenging and, odds are, seriously unsettling. The director, auspiciously, is Lila Neugebauer, who brought a thrilling physicality to Sarah DeLappe's sleeper hit ""The Wolves"" earlier this season.","Those setting fire to stages this month include Jake Gyllenhaal, Glenn Close and Joan of Arc.",79598db3-1631-5d30-8114-6821f5a6ac4a,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/02/03/arts/sunset/sunset-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b21210359832b0af9635a072d2240b2cae71d9708df050931f4e5e90e004f057&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Glenn Close in ""Sunset Boulevard.""",79598db3-1631-5d30-8114-6821f5a6ac4a,N24News/imgs/79598db3-1631-5d30-8114-6821f5a6ac4a.jpg,10
Global Business,Central Banks Stand at Ready to Fortify Euro,https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/16/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html,"With an election looming in Greece that could determine the future of the euro, central bankers overseas signaled Friday that they were prepared to take action to shore up nervous financial markets after Sunday's vote. The head of the European Central Bank, Mario Draghi, hinted that he would be ready to pump cash into banks there to head off turmoil. His counterpart in Tokyo, Masaaki Shirakawa, promised that the Bank of Japan was ready to ""to take all possible measures to ensure the financial system does not come under threat."" The statements underscored just how anxious policy makers are ahead of the vote, which they fear could result in a victory by left-wing parties that oppose the deep austerity Greece agreed to in exchange for financial help. If the anti-austerity Syriza party wins, it could eventually force an exit by Greece from the euro zone and feed fears of a broader financial crisis. Authorities hope that a large infusion of cash into the financial system, if needed next week, could act as a financial firewall to help protect shakier banks in Southern Europe. Depositors have been fleeing not only Greek banks, but Spanish banks as well, raising concerns that these institutions could run short of the funds necessary to conduct normal business. As worries have spread, banks on the Continent have sharply curtailed short-term loans to each other out of concern that they may not be repaid if things start spinning out of control. That fear has further dried up the flow of money in many European economies.

It is unclear whether authorities can pump enough money into the system to stave off troubles if the Greek election results scare investors. But investors welcomed Mr. Draghi's pledge as a sign that after years of half-steps that repeatedly failed to halt the momentum of the crisis in Europe, leaders were finally facing up to the severity of Europe's distress and acting before investors forced their hand. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose more than 1 percent Friday, a sign that investors were confident central bankers and governments would act quickly if need be. European markets also rallied Friday, with German stocks rising nearly 1.5 percent and French shares up 1.8 percent. But in the past, these kinds of upward moves have quickly faded amid doubts over whether long-term fixes will be found. ""Markets and people need to be reassured we are still traveling together,"" Mr. Draghi told a group of economists in Frankfurt. ""The euro system will continue to supply liquidity to solvent banks where needed."" The Federal Reserve in Washington has taken a wait-and-see attitude toward the vote, but Obama administration officials have made it plain just how high the stakes are for the United States in Europe's debt crisis. ""Euro-area fragility remains the key risk to our recovery and the global economy,"" Lael Brainard, the Treasury under secretary for international affairs, said Friday.

After more than two years of tension, the coming days are seen as a turning point that could determine whether Europe's fiscal ties grow closer or fray. On the heels of the Greek vote, leaders of the Group of 20 nations will gather in Mexico on Monday and Tuesday, with European leaders set to hold a summit meeting of their own later this month. Any move by the European Central Bank in response to the Greek election would fall short of the kind of structural changes investors want to see Europe make, most notably the ability to issue euro zone bonds to relieve pressure on riskier borrowers like Spain and Italy and a Continentwide guarantee for bank deposits to halt capital flight. A broader, more concrete blueprint to remake the structure of the euro zone would be made public ""in a matter of days,"" Mr. Draghi said, so that it can be considered by European leaders when they gather in late June. ""We need a credible vision for the long-term stability of the euro zone,"" said Markus Krygier, a money manager in London who is betting on more trouble ahead for the euro. ""If you don't have that, traders will keep coming back and try to test the euro zone.""

Ultimately, though, it will be the European Central Bank that is best positioned to keep a local crisis in Greece from broadening into Continentwide or global financial contagion, strategists said. ""The E.C.B. holds the key to this,"" said Hans Mikkelsen, a credit strategist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""We can expect the E.C.B. to do what it takes."" He noted that Mr. Draghi's willingness to act boldly stood in contrast to his predecessor, Jean-Claude Trichet, who took a more cautious stance when it came to central bank intervention. Since taking over as president of the European Central Bank in November 2011, Mr. Draghi has twice extended funds to European banks through long-term loans and, Mr. Mikkelsen noted, might do so a third time if necessary after the Greek vote. The Federal Reserve also has formidable tools at its disposal to contain the fallout from a financial crisis, as it has demonstrated repeatedly in recent years. The Fed's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has made clear that the Fed will take any actions necessary to ensure that American banks, including the subsidiaries of foreign banks, can borrow enough money to finance their operations. But so far there is little evidence of financing pressure on this side of the Atlantic. And the Fed is unlikely to take major steps unless events in Europe begin to destabilize the American financial system or to impede the domestic economy.",The days after Greece's elections are seen as a turning point that could determine whether Europe's fiscal ties grow closer or fray.,67b6df6a-2ec4-58d8-9d81-fafeee6e8f03,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2012/06/16/business/EUROZONE/EUROZONE-articleLarge.jpg?year=2012&h=330&w=600&s=877bd14906002d560e1e1fb600dca765e382a532c01d070088c8678912e4280a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Supporters of Antonis Samaras, leader of Greece's New Democracy party, lit flares and waved the Greek national flag during a pre-election rally in Athens, Greece, on Friday.",67b6df6a-2ec4-58d8-9d81-fafeee6e8f03,N24News/imgs/67b6df6a-2ec4-58d8-9d81-fafeee6e8f03.jpg,24

Science,"Climate Change Is Shrinking Where Bumblebees Range, Research Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/10/science/bumblebees-global-warming-shrinking-habitats.html,"Climate change has narrowed the range where bumblebees are found in North America and Europe in recent decades, according to a study published Thursday. The paper, published in the journal Science, suggests that warming temperatures have caused bumblebee populations to retreat from the southern limits of their travels by as much as 190 miles since the 1970s. Logic would suggest that the northern reaches of their home turf would shift to higher latitudes by a corresponding distance. But that has not happened, leading researchers to think that the more northern habitats may be less hospitable to them. ""Bumblebee species across Europe and North America are declining at continental scales,"" Jeremy T. Kerr a conservation biologist at the University of Ottawa in Canada who was the lead author of the report, said at a news conference. ""And our data suggest that climate change plays a leading, or perhaps the leading, role in this trend.""

Not all entomologists agree with the findings, saying that the paper offers evidence of a correlation between climate change and waning bumblebee population ranges, but does not make the case that warming temperatures are the main cause. Instead, they say that a multitude of factors contribute to the bumblebees' shrinking borders, and that a changing climate may be just one factor. For the study, the researchers constructed a database that contained more than 420,000 observations of 67 different European and North American bumblebee species, including when and where they were found. The museum records stretch back more than 110 years.

The researchers analyzed the observations along with climate information from every year from 1900 to 2010 in the regions and drew conclusions about how the northern and southern limits of different bumblebee species shifted over the past century. They compared population changes from 1974 to 2010, when temperatures began to warm, with changes from 1901 to 1974, when human-caused climate change was less of a factor. They found that the southernmost range of bumblebees retreated north at a rate of about 3 miles per year (the precise latitude was different for the many species of bees they studied).

For example, Bombus affinis once buzzed as far south as Georgia, but now is only rarely seen in states like Illinois, Maine and Wisconsin, while Bombus terricola, which thrived in North Carolina and the Mid-Atlantic, is now mostly seen in parts of Maine, New Hampshire, Ontario and Quebec, according to Leif Richardson, an ecologist from the University of Vermont and a co-author of the paper. ""One of the most striking results was that trends were often indistinguishable between Europe and North America,"" said Paul Galpern, a landscape ecologist from the University of Calgary and a co-author of the paper. ""Bumblebee species are responding quite similarly across continents since climate change began to really accelerate from 1975."" The findings did not entirely surprise Dave Goulson, a bee biologist at the University of Sussex in Britain who was not part of the study. He said in an email that he expected bees, which thrive in cooler climates, to be adversely affected by climate change, particularly in the southern tips of their range. ""What is more surprising,"" he said, ""is that they do not seem to be expanding northwards. Perhaps because suitable habitat is not available to the north of their existing ranges."" He called the study the first clear evidence that many species were shrinking across huge geographic scales. Sydney Cameron, an entomology professor at the University of Illinois who specializes in bumblebee conservation, called the study ""noteworthy"" for its vast data set and expansive range, but disputed its findings.

Climate change, she said, might be a factor in the potential shrinking of bumblebee ranges, but it is too early to say for certain. ""It's correlative, not causal; they cannot say that a two-degree climate change caused these patterns,"" she added, referring to an approximate Celsius reading for changes across the regions. Dr. Cameron also took issue with the paper's suggestion that bumblebee population loss could be mitigated through interventions such as ""assisted migration,"" in which the populations are physically moved farther north. She called that an ""impractical solution"" because of the risk of species spreading pathogens. The researchers also analyzed long-term data on habitat loss and pesticide use, including neonicotinoids that have been criticized by bee conservationists for flustering bees and causing them to forget how to buzz their way home. ""The question is, have neonicotinoids or habitat losses caused the huge range losses we observed in this study?"" said Alana Pindar, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Guelph and an author of the paper. ""The answer for now is clearly 'No.'"" She added that although these factors were known to harm bee populations, the study showed that climate change was the main reason behind the severe population shrinkage. James Strange, an entomologist with the Department of Agriculture, did not agree with that assertion. ""What they've shown is that climate change has at least some effects on the population changes of some bumblebee species,"" Dr. Strange said. ""But I did not come away convinced that climate change is causing these movements."" He said he was worried this paper might cause people to blame climate change entirely for bee population destruction and ignore potential factors such as parasites, pesticides and habitat destruction. ""There's a bit of me that's nervous someone will pick this up and say 'They figured it out: It's climate change,' "" Dr. Strange said. ""But really, we haven't figured it out yet.""","Warming temperatures have caused bumblebee populations to retreat from the southern limits of their travels in North America and Europe, according to a new study.",c64785b2-a312-5227-91c6-2b206643fe7e,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2015/07/10/science/10bees1/10bees1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2015&h=549&w=1050&s=2b9b74d129a299e2d3f150b9dc8a2b2b46003ed881ac3497f4762c67e11f5366&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"A buff-tailed bumblebee on catmint flowers.

Television,"Review: 'Counterpart' Gives Us J.K.

Privy to it are the senior members of the large, somewhat bumbling bidimensional bureaucracy that manages the portal, who are allowed to pass between worlds using visas measured in hours.

The two Howards are part of that apparatus, the meek Howard a paper-shuffler in the original world and the macho Howard a covert agent for the splinter world. They meet -- an almost unheard-of occurrence -- when the macho Howard follows a criminal who manages to cross between worlds and needs to pose as the meek Howard to catch her.

The story's Cold War allusions and Berlin setting provide an apt -- or maybe too cute -- framework for a story of alternate worlds suddenly developing side by side. They also drive home Mr. Marks's debt to John le Carre -- ""Counterpart"" pays hommage to Mr. le Carre's classic Cold War morality tale, ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold,"" while pumping up the dystopian, Orwellian mood and visuals (and borrowing discreetly from the premise of the Fox sci-fi series ""Fringe"").

More centrally, the show is an argument about nature versus nurture, in both geopolitical and personal terms. Will the two worlds, and the two Howards, in their separation, inevitably become nothing like each other? Or will their basic natures prove to be stronger?

Through six episodes, Mr. Marks doesn't do anything especially interesting with that premise, but luckily for him and us, Mr. Simmons, an Oscar winner in 2015 for ""Whiplash,"" does.

There are Millions of New Millionaires, but Not at Art Sales

LONDON -- An estimated $67.4 billion of art was sold worldwide last year, an increase of 6 percent on 2017, according to an influential report released on Friday. Yet growth in the art market remains within a narrow band, the data showed. The total, cited in the annual Art Basel and UBS report, combined auction and dealer sales and was the second-highest in the last 10 years, behind the $68.2 billion of 2014. But the report noted that while the number of wealthy individuals in the world had risen sharply, they were not spending much more on art. The study quoted data from Credit Suisse estimating that the global population of dollar millionaires increased to 42.2 million last year, from 29.7 million in 2011. That does not seem to have translated into art buying, however. In 2011, global art sales were estimated at $64.6 billion, just a small fraction below what Art Basel and UBS calculated they were in 2018.

""The art world seems to have a conversion problem,"" said Doug Woodham, managing partner at Art Fiduciary Advisors in New York. ""For some time now, spending in the global art market has significantly lagged growth."" The United States was the largest market, with 44 percent of the world's art transactions by value, totaling $29.9 billion, its highest level in a decade, according to the report. Britain climbed to second place, with 21 percent of sales (""despite Brexit worries,"" the report notes). China dropped from second to third, at 19 percent.

""While we've seen another strong year of aggregate sales, the mood of the market in 2018 was generally less optimistic, as many wider economic and political issues continued to weigh heavily on sentiment,"" wrote the report's author, the art economist Clare McAndrew. The report estimated that in 2018, dealer sales increased 7 percent to an estimated $35.9 billion, or 53 percent of the market. Large-scale gallerists reportedly enjoyed the biggest gains, with sales increasing 17 percent.

The Art Basel and UBS report is the only comprehensive overview of a market that Ms. McAndrew characterized as ""notoriously opaque."" While data from public auction sales are freely available, dealer transactions remain private and difficult to quantify. The report estimated gallery sales based on an online survey sent to 6,500 dealers worldwide, including more than 500 that participate in Art Basel shows. Over all, 17.5 percent responded. The results indicated that 46 percent of sales by dealers were made at art fairs. Because of the relatively small sample size, some experts have expressed skepticism about the methodology and questioned the reliability of the report's extrapolated figures. ""I find that figure very high,"" said Alain Servais, a Belgian collector, referring to the reported sales at art fairs. ""It must be based on galleries who do six or seven fairs a year and have specialist teams,"" added Mr. Servais, who is a frequent visitor to fairs around the world. He pointed out a recent study by the specialist website Artsy estimating that only 10 to 15 percent of gallery sales took place at fairs. Online sales reached an estimated $6 billion in 2018, up 11 percent year-on-year, according to the Art Basel and UBS report. But that is still less than 10 percent of the market as a whole. Ms. McAndrew, in the conclusion of the Art Basel and UBS report, said that in recent years, buoyancy in the art market had been supported by ""a very small fragment of ultrawealthy buyers"" whose involvement was at risk of being affected by ""exogenous events."" A broader base of buyers lower down the wealth scale had so far been slower to engage in the market, she said.

Be it Brexit or other geopolitical volatility, ""exogenous events"" seemed to be weighing on the minds of both sellers and buyers at this past week's contemporary art auctions in London. In March 2018, Sotheby's, Christie's and Phillips's evening contemporary sales raised an aggregate total of 344.6 million pounds, or about $478 million. This week, the total was down to PS209 million, a decline of about 39 percent. Top quality works were in short supply and bidding was measured.","The annual Art Basel and UBS report shows market growth is stagnating.

Books,"Coming Soon to the Bronx, a Long Overdue Book Festival",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/16/books/bronx-book-festival.html,"""I attended my first book festival as an adult in Brooklyn,"" said Saraciea Fennell. ""I thought to myself, 'This is amazing. Why doesn't the Bronx have something like this?'""

""This is where I bought most of my books,"" Saraciea J. Fennell said, pointing out to East Fordham Road in the Bronx from the Starbucks where we met in April. Among the check cashing locations, pawn shops and bodegas that lined the commercial thoroughfare when she was growing up, she said, were street vendors selling an assortment of books -- from urban fiction to dictionaries. On Saturday, the Bronx Book Festival, a literary event organized by Ms. Fennell, will take place in that same neighborhood, at Fordham Plaza. The all-day event will bring writers, illustrators and industry professionals to the community, as well as a vendor to sell books on-site. ""I attended my first book festival as an adult in Brooklyn,"" said Ms. Fennell, 29, who works as a publicist for Tor Books, an imprint of MacMillan. ""I thought to myself, 'This is amazing. Why doesn't the Bronx have something like this?'""

The borough, which is home to 1.5 million people, has been a bookstore desert since 2016. That is when a Barnes & Noble once located in the Baychester neighborhood closed -- leaving the Bronx without a single general interest bookstore -- despite community efforts to save it. The shuttering of the store lit a fire under Ms. Fennell, who felt an urgent need for an infusion of literary influence in her hometown.

For Ms. Fennell, who was placed in foster care when she was 8, books were an escape. Though her caretakers were ""lovely,"" she said, ""I felt lonely and alienated, because I was around strangers."" She spent most weekends at the library and bought books with her allowance, from Roald Dahl's ""James and the Giant Peach"" to ""Flower's Bed"" by Antoine Inch Thomas. By the time she was 13, she was again living with her mother, a Honduran immigrant Ms. Fennell calls an ""oral storyteller,"" whom she credits with instilling in her a love of stories. But Ms. Fennell ""didn't even realize"" publishing was an industry until a professor encouraged her to enroll in City College's publishing certificate program. ""I remember attending school in the Bronx, there weren't any authors, no illustrators,"" she recalled. ""There weren't people coming to visit us and talk about their books.""

This observation was amplified when, as a publicist for Scholastic early in her career, she was charged with bringing authors to schools and realized the Bronx was largely neglected. To remedy this, she is launching The Bronx is Reading -- a literacy program that will target those underserved schools -- in tandem with the festival. ""I really want them to see that there are people of color writing books,"" she said of the students. Young adult novelists Elizabeth Acevedo and Tracey Baptiste will be among the first visiting writers. The vendor for the festival is Noelle Santos, who is preparing to open The Lit. Bar in the South Bronx, bringing a general interest bookstore to the borough once again. But Ms. Santos insists that the festival and her forthcoming shop will reveal rather than originate an already burgeoning literary scene. ""This festival and The Lit. Bar are important because we need to create intellectual visibility in the Bronx,"" said Ms. Santos. ""We have it here. We have intellectuals in the Bronx,"" she explained, but she hopes the two initiatives will bring books and literature to the fore. Ms. Fennell also calls the literary community ""very invisible"" -- and that reality influenced her decision to establish the festival, which will consist of six panels featuring adult, young adult and middle grade authors, as an outdoor and free event. Next year, Ms. Fennell hopes to incorporate Spanish language programming, as well, to cater to the Bronx's substantial Latinx community. Even for those who don't read books, Ms. Fennell said, the festival could be the ""small spark"" they need to start.",The literary event and a new general interest bookstore mark a revival in the borough.,4bfe0ee5-7eca-5966-9e4e-161effce5e9c,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/18/arts/18bxbookfest1/18bxbookfest1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3b00c108f3d6932b406a6e91dcc108e8b6da322b94cf779b6f155bc7dab8cab4&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Saraciea Fennell, founder of the Bronx Book Festival.",4bfe0ee5-7eca-5966-9e4e-161effce5e9c,N24News/imgs/4bfe0ee5-7eca-5966-9e4e-161effce5e9c.jpg,13
Art & Design,Warren Kanders Quits Whitney Board After Tear Gas Protests,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/arts/whitney-warren-kanders-resigns.html,"Warren B. Kanders, a vice chairman of the Whitney Museum of American Art, stepped down on Thursday after months of protests over his company's sale of tear gas, culminating in the withdrawal of eight artists last week from the prestigious Whitney Biennial exhibition. ""The targeted campaign of attacks against me and my company that has been waged these past several months has threatened to undermine the important work of the Whitney,"" Mr. Kanders said in his resignation letter. ""I joined this board to help the museum prosper. I do not wish to play a role, however inadvertent, in its demise."" Mr. Kanders owns Safariland, a Jacksonville, Fla.-based manufacturer of law enforcement and military supplies including bulletproof vests, bomb-defusing robots, gun holsters and tear gas. Protesters had demanded Mr. Kanders's resignation, or removal from the board, after reports that Safariland's tear-gas grenades had been used against migrants at the United States-Mexico border and elsewhere during protests. The controversy thrust the museum into the political arguments roiling the country, and came at a time of increasing scrutiny of where cultural institutions get their money. Mr. Kanders's departure could embolden other protest movements that have demanded, with some success, that museums part ways with major donors or trustees.

The growing influence of these movements, and their potential to drive away major sources of museums' revenue such as Mr. Kanders, was evident in the reaction of Adam D. Weinberg, the Whitney's director. ""Here's a man who has given a tremendous amount of his time and money to young, often edgy and radical artists -- somebody who is very progressive -- that's one of the ironies of all this,"" Mr. Weinberg said. ""The Whitney Museum is one of the most progressive, the most diverse, the most engaged, open programs of any major institution in the country,"" Mr. Weinberg added. ""Every museum director is looking at us right now and saying, 'Gee, if the Whitney is being targeted, what's going to happen to us?'""

In what amounted to a brief counterprotest, the hedge fund titan Kenneth C. Griffin also stepped down from the board on Thursday, during a telephone call with other board members, according to a person who was on the call. Mr. Griffin, a billionaire whose name is on the Whitney's lobby, was dismayed by what he described as the museum's left-wing tilt, according to the person on the call. But Mr. Griffin apparently reconsidered, and decided to stay. ""I'm a trustee of the Whitney and excited to be on the board,"" he said in a telephone interview Thursday evening. When pressed about what had transpired earlier in the day, Mr. Griffin said, ""I think board conversations are private,"" adding, ""I haven't resigned."" He also said, ""all cultural institutions in the United States should be places of open dialogue."" For those who had called on Mr. Kanders to leave, the day was a joyous one. The eight artists who withdrew from the Biennial said that they would now remain in the show. (Their works had not yet been removed.) And the group that led the protests, Decolonize This Place, said that it was heartened by Mr. Kanders's departure, thanked the museum for heeding its calls while also suggesting that the group was not done demanding changes. ""Now we address the day after Kanders and call on Adam Weinberg and the museum leadership to meet with stakeholders to discuss from tear gas to decolonization, a process of reformulating our museums to be responsive to the constituencies they claim to serve,"" the group said in a statement. Mr. Kanders, 61, joined the Whitney board in 2006, had been on the executive committee for seven years, and has donated more than $10 million to the museum. Through a spokesman, he declined to comment on Thursday. He and his wife, Allison, are avid art collectors, owning work by contemporary artists like Jeff Koons, Christopher Wool, Rudolf Stingel and Ed Ruscha. Ms. Kanders was co-chairwoman of the museum's painting and sculpture committee; she resigned simultaneously with her husband.

A graduate of Choate Rosemary Hall, the elite Connecticut boarding school, and Brown University, Mr. Kanders began working in finance doing mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley. He later struck out on his own, buying up a series of eyewear stores, lens and frame manufacturers that he eventually sold in 1996. Mr. Kanders plowed some of his profits into a company called American Body Armor. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, another business he had purchased, which made armor for vehicles, took off, and he continued investing in law enforcement and military products. Pressure on the Whitney began last November, when more than 100 staff members signed a letter demanding that the museum respond to a report on the website Hyperallergic that linked Mr. Kanders to the tear gas fired by border protection agents into a crowd that included children. In December, one of the artists in the Biennial, Michael Rakowitz, pulled out of the exhibition to protest Mr. Kanders. Four months later, a group of critics, scholars and artists called for Mr. Kanders's removal. Periodic demonstrations at the museum reached a climax at the official opening of the Biennial in May, as a giant tear gas sculpture was parked near the entrance and protesters marched to Mr. Kanders's Greenwich Village townhouse . Then last week, four artists -- including the MacArthur ""genius grant"" winner Nicole Eisenman -- in a letter published by Artforum asked the Whitney to remove their work from the Biennial, which runs through Sept. 22; four more followed suit. More than 60 artists remained in the show, but the withdrawals created a tipping point for tensions already overshadowing the Whitney's signature event. Mr. Kanders, who has donated generously to various charities besides the Whitney, and to politicians from both major parties, had remained unmoved . Responding to the museum staff's letter, he wrote in December, ""I think it is clear that I am not the problem the authors of the letter seek to solve."" Safariland's slogan is ""Together, We Save Lives,"" and Mr. Kanders has said repeatedly that there were many examples of police officers who were saved by his company's products.","Days after eight artists left the Whitney Biennial, the vice chairman stepped down amid criticism of how his company's law enforcement supplies are used.",da535eca-98e9-58a8-821a-5adaaf84b657,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/07/26/multimedia/26whitney1-print/merlin_154442487_7cda26b2-f382-4a9d-9514-2dfc9451a2a1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=eb6a5b90bff1db1092a41ae88c3553bdcacda3ccbbbffabb3cad9b7b6f142e29&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Protesters in May demanding that Warren B.

Music,"Is 'The Bassarids' an Operatic Masterpiece, or 'Strauss Turned Sour'?",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/17/arts/music/henze-bassarids-salzburg.html,"It's a strange, seductive story. A young man becomes king. The king becomes a bit overconfident, deciding to test his power against a charismatic stranger's worshipers. This stranger -- it turns out he's the god of wine and dance -- responds by ensorcelling members of the royal family. Eventually, the king loses his head: to his own mother, a follower of the new cult. The composer Hans Werner Henze (1926-2012) was approached with this streamlined adaptation of Euripides's ""The Bacchae"" in 1963, and eventually created ""The Bassarids,"" which is getting a rare revival at the Salzburg Festival in Austria through Aug. 26. When he first gave the subject serious thought, the 37-year-old Henze was already well known; his Fifth Symphony had just had its premiere with the New York Philharmonic and Leonard Bernstein. He had been writing operas for more than a decade, starting with his first full-length work for the stage, ""Boulevard Solitude,"" a jagged (and sometimes jazzy) take on the ""Manon Lescaut"" story.

Instead, he began work on a comic opera, ""The Young Lord."" He also conducted; he later suggested that the experience of leading works by Schubert and Brahms seasoned him for the challenges of Auden and Kallman's text. A year later, he felt he'd put in enough preparation, and began writing. If the story of ""The Bassarids"" wasn't a surprise, Henze's music was. It had dodecaphonic (or atonal) elements but was not rigidly conceived in that language, the one preferred by Pierre Boulez and other titans of the post-World War II avant-garde. Nor was the sound a pure throwback that would delight Romantics weary of modernism. Instead, the score managed a rare balance of experimental and traditional effects. In his autobiography, ""Bohemian Fifths,"" Henze described himself as a Mahlerian, while also approvingly quoting a critic who called the opera ""Strauss turned sour."" This synthesis was not unanimously hailed at the opera's premiere at the Salzburg Festival in 1966. Writing for The New York Times in 1974, Peter Heyworth recalled seeing the then-chair of London's Royal Opera House leaping from his seat ""like a scalded cat"" at the curtain. But it was exactly what Auden, in particular, had wanted.

""I am convinced that Hans has written a masterpiece,"" he wrote in a letter quoted in the complete edition of his librettos with Kallman. The work soon found champions -- most prominent among them Christoph von Dohnanyi, who not only conducted the premiere, but also campaigned for the work in the United States, presenting it in Cleveland and New York. Its return to Salzburg this month, in a staging by Krzysztof Warlikowski, is conducted by another of its supporters, Kent Nagano. In a phone interview between rehearsals, Mr. Nagano described ""The Bassarids"" as an opera that works ""at the highest state of refinement."" ""It is based upon layered tonalities,"" he said. ""Sometimes you feel it's a forerunner of what today we might call spectral music."" Mr. Nagano said that when he led the opera in the 1980s, he felt Henze's language to be progressive. But ""now, from the perspective of 2018,"" he added, ""we see many of the dramatic gestures that Henze makes in 'new music' or even in popular music. The way that various elements of tonality will collide with each other -- and, at the end, produce a resonance, upon which it makes room for a very lyric quality."" Markus Hinterhauser, a pianist and the artistic director of the Salzburg Festival, described the orthodoxy of the mid-20th century. ""There was Stockhausen, there was Nono, there was Boulez,"" he said. ""There was a very defined monopole about what contemporary music grammar could be. And Henze was apart from that."" Mr. Hinterhauser said he admires the work's political dimensions: ""It's the incredible conflict between the ecstasy -- the passion -- and the reason. Who triumphs over this question?""

""Yeah, of course,"" he replied. ""This is the victory of the ecstasy. But you can also interpret it so that it's the victory of the total hedonistic world. And now it becomes very political, the whole thing. Looking at our very specific situation, our lives. Where is it going, this world?"" Mr. Hinterhauser declined to be pinned down about these contemporary resonances, especially before rehearsals for the new staging were complete. But Mr. Nagano offered one way of placing the Euripidean conflict in our time, noting that, ""as we confront the new and rapid evolution of the technical world that we live in,"" questions of what is rational and what is irrational have become ""regular and dominant social topics.""

Auden, for his part, was wary of tidy summations of the work, or overtly allegorical analyses of it. Responding to Henze's request for an essay that could be included in the program, Auden wrote, ""I am very much against trying to state a myth in abstract logical terms, which rob it of all its resonance, e.g., if one starts talking about recent history, one will have fools saying that Dionysus is Hitler."" And the opera itself changes its already ambiguous meaning depending on the version you encounter. At the Salzburg premiere in 1966, there was an Intermezzo that included some attractive music at the king's expense. (Auden and Kallman have their Queen Agave editorialize about her son: ""My dear, I thought he'd never end. 'I am Pentheus, King of Thebes. Obey me. Answer.' He may be King. He'll never make a dancer."") The creative team also created a myth-within-a-myth dream scene, ""The Judgment of Calliope."" The jesting instrumental writing in this nearly 20-minute section adds a new dimension to the opera's presentation of the Dionysian cult, which is otherwise characterized with terrifying, destructive timbres. Auden and Kallman wrote that, with the Intermezzo, they were seeking not only to provide some respite from the ""sober air of religious disaster,"" but also to suggest that the visions of the truth-seeking King Pentheus pave the way for his falling under Dionysus's spell.

Without these scenes, the king can seem a thinner character: the uncompromising enemy of a god, rather than someone also at war with elements of human nature. But the team had second thoughts about these scenes. Auden and Kallman thought that Henze overscored this part of the opera. And Henze cut the Intermezzo, including ""The Judgment of Calliope,"" in later editions. These passages, as well as a spoken prologue used at the opera's North American premiere, will be included in Salzburg this year. ""What is being performed here is very much inspired by the original score, the original theatrical intentions of the libretto,"" Mr. Nagano said. ""The purpose is really to demonstrate what a natural composer Henze was, writing for the theater."" This attempt is particularly noteworthy given that the opera has never been ideally served on recordings. A CD set of the Salzburg premiere is still available, though that production was sung in a German translation -- an unfortunate choice, given the crispness of Auden and Kallman's English, as well as Henze's talent in setting it. A subsequent recording of the opera does use the English text, but does not include the cut scenes and is out of print. It's a problem common to Henze's formidable dramatic catalog. Earlier this year, at Dutch National Opera's Opera Forward Festival in Amsterdam, I was dazzled by his oratorio ""The Raft of the Medusa"" in its grandly orchestrated 1990 revision; the only in-print recording of the work is a comparatively skeletal 1960s version on Deutsche Grammophon. Henze's prior collaboration with Auden and Kallman, ""Elegy for Young Lovers,"" was also recorded on Deutsche Grammophon, but not in a complete edition (and, again, in German). ""I have all these recordings at home, and it's quite hard to listen to them,"" Mr. Hinterhauser said. ""The interpretation now is on another level. The orchestra plays on another level; the singers are very familiar with this kind of language, this kind of drama."" He agreed that ""there should be some initiative"" to preserve more of Henze's operatic catalog. So how about a DVD or CD of this season's ""Bassarids""? ""We are working on it,"" he said. ""It's quite complicated to find a producer for that. It might be a DVD; it might be a recording. But there will be something. I think we can be a little bit optimistic.""","Hans Werner Henze's opera, based on Euripides's ""The Bacchae,"" returns this month to the Salzburg Festival, the site of its premiere in 1966.",11fa8eda-5fc5-5bd6-8867-366369913052,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/08/19/arts/19HENZE3/19HENZE3-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=3393434b3b7e2f174958d1c5fdd23b90c1ce85f9f353f6a20480978960468a87&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"If the story of &ldquo;The Bassarids&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, Hans Werner Henze&rsquo;s music was.

Movies,'All Creatures Here Below' Review: A Runaway Couple in Crisis,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/16/movies/all-creatures-here-below-review.html,"""All Creatures Here Below"" is a Midwestern tragedy that, scene by scene, grows incrementally more horrific.

After both are fired through no fault of their own, Gensan unwisely bets his severance pay on an illegal cockfight that leaves him fleeing the law with a stolen car and a blood-spattered wad of cash.

Media,Spotify's New Licensing Deal Eases Path to Going Public,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/04/business/media/spotify-universal-music-group-licensing.html,"After two years of on-and-off negotiations, Spotify and the world's biggest record company have finally agreed to a licensing deal that paves the way for Spotify to go public and gives the music industry more flexibility in how new albums are streamed.

Spotify's agreement with the record company, Universal Music Group -- whose hundreds of artists include Drake, U2, the Weeknd and Lady Gaga -- is a global, multiyear deal, the companies announced on Tuesday. Spotify's licensing contracts with all three major record companies had long since expired, and Universal's deal, the first to be renewed, will put pressure on the other major labels, Sony and Warner, to follow suit.

For Spotify, the deal removes a major obstacle to going public. The streaming music company, which has been valued by investors at more than $8 billion, has by far the largest service of its kind, with 50 million paying subscribers and at least another 50 million who listen to music on Spotify's free tier, which has advertising. But without contracts in place guaranteeing the presence of the music on its service -- Universal controls around a third of all music sales around the world -- the company would have difficulty attracting investors on the public markets.",The long-awaited agreement with the Universal Music Group will allow artists to withhold new releases from Spotify's free tier for two weeks.,b6af2d83-458b-5c8a-a899-c7951b7828ae,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/04/05/business/05SPOTIFY1/05SPOTIFY1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=b8e7a0b85cc5aabc4278e5bac07126529dae448809884747ba88989fafb0952c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"Lady Gaga, an artist with the Universal Music Group, performing at the Super Bowl in February.

Sports,"M.L.B. Awards: In a Short Season, Veterans Are Standing Out",https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/23/sports/baseball/mlb-awards.html,"A typical baseball schedule is merciless -- six weeks of spring training followed by six months of games, with few days off and many thousands of air miles. The advantage for younger players shows up in the list of Most Valuable Player Award winners; it has been 13 years since anyone started a season in his 30s and won the M.V.P. That was Alex Rodriguez of the Yankees, in 2007 -- and he, of course, used performance-enhancing drugs at various points in his career. The last player to do it without ties to steroids was Jeff Kent of the San Francisco Giants, two decades ago. This pandemic season, as you may have noticed, is far different from any other. With just 60 games in the regular season, and travel limited to divisional regions, it should theoretically be easier for older players to stand out. Sure enough, some leading contenders for the M.V.P. Awards are out of their 20s: The Atlanta Braves' Freddie Freeman was 30 on opening day in late July, and the Chicago White Sox' Jose Abreu was 33. Picking the winners for such a small sample of games will be tricky for voting members of the Baseball Writers' Association of America. (The New York Times does not participate in awards voting.) But as the season enters its final days, this is how the leaders look from here, with all statistics through Tuesday.

Freddie Freeman has a remarkably similar pedigree to that of the Colorado Rockies' Nolan Arenado and the St. Louis Cardinals' Paul Goldschmidt: All are infielders who have won the Gold Glove and Silver Slugger awards and made at least four All-Star teams; all made their debuts in the first part of the 2010s and have spent their careers with mid-market National League teams, earning multiple trips to the postseason but never to the World Series; all rarely stir controversy and seem averse to self-promotion. The M.V.P. Award is its own kind of promotion, and Freeman should become the first of the three to win it after a combined 13 finishes in the top 10. He is leading the N.L. in times on base for the third year in a row, while batting .347 with 12 homers and 50 runs batted in -- numbers all the more impressive because of what came before. In early July, three weeks before the start of the regular season, Freeman struggled with a case of Covid-19. He prayed when his fever spiked to 104.5 degrees, he said. ""My body was really, really hot, so I said, 'Please don't take me,'"" Freeman told reporters when he returned. ""I wasn't ready.""

If we're going to be swayed by the outsize production of a steady, dependable, veteran first baseman in the N.L. race, we've got to endorse Jose Abreu in the A.L. Abreu has been a foundational piece since the White Sox signed him out of Cuba before the 2014 season, and the team refused to trade him during a roster overhaul that has made Chicago a force. Smart move: Abreu leads the majors in hits (74), runs batted in (56) and total bases (141), while playing every game and belting 19 homers. His younger teammate, shortstop Tim Anderson, has continued his ascent with a .353 average. The Yankees' D.J. LeMahieu and Luke Voit, Cleveland's Jose Ramirez and the Angels' Mike Trout and Anthony Rendon have been outstanding, too. But Abreu is the choice.

But Bauer, the iconoclastic right-hander, has been the best at the two factors that should matter most when evaluating pitching excellence: durability and dominance -- that is, overpowering hitters while consistently working deep into games. The Reds can count on Bauer for at least 100 pitches in nearly every start (he has thrown fewer than 100 just once this season), and the results have been dazzling: a 1.80 earned run average with about 12 strikeouts, two walks and five hits allowed per nine innings.

When something very obvious and distinctive identifies a player, he has to be really good to shake it. The Houston Astros' Jose Altuve was always associated with his height (5 feet 6 inches) until he played so well that people stopped bringing it up. Shane Bieber is entering that territory. He's the only Bieber in major league history, but, of course, he's hardly the most famous entertainer with the name. For Players' Weekend last summer, Bieber, 25, poked fun at himself by wearing a jersey with ""NOT JUSTIN"" stitched across the back. He still trails Justin Bieber in Twitter followers by the slim margin of 112.4 million to 30,800, but he has become so successful on the mound that his eye-catching name is an afterthought. We mention it here only because Bieber's greatness as a pitcher has been so obvious. He leads the majors in wins (8), E.R.A. (1.74) and strikeouts (112), and should win the Cy Young Award unanimously. It will be his first, but may not be his last.

The Phillies' Alec Bohm has blazed through September as Jake Cronenworth's production has waned. But Bohm did not debut until Aug. 13. By then, Cronenworth was hitting .333 and had started at first and second base, helping to steady the Padres until their late-August surge. Cronenworth, who is hitting .304 with an .886 OPS, would be just the third Padre to win the Rookie of the Year Award and the first since Benito Santiago in 1987. Besides from Bohm, he could face competition from starter Dustin May of the Dodgers, a team whose past is brimming with rookies of the year. Starting with the award's namesake, Jackie Robinson, in 1947, Dodgers players have won the award 18 times.

The Mariners haven't had a rookie of the year since Ichiro Suzuki in 2001, which was also their last playoff season. Their drought is the longest in baseball, and longer than that of any team in the N.F.L., N.B.A. and N.H.L., too. It will continue through 2020, but Seattle's long-term plan is taking shape, with Lewis as a pillar. Though he never played in Class AAA, he has built off a 2019 cameo to hit .272 with 11 homers, a good eye at the plate and sensational defense. Lewis, who played at Mercer University, was chosen 11th over all in the 2016 draft, which means 10 teams whiffed on a future star. In Seattle, he is a worthy heir to the tradition of dynamic center fielders who came before him, like Ken Griffey Jr., Mike Cameron and Adam Jones, a first-round pick the Mariners traded, something they regretted for a decade.",The top contenders for baseball's annual awards include two 30-somethings who could take home the Most Valuable Player Awards.,60616add-ab7d-5a40-8ca5-c385d4197ff0,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2020/09/23/sports/23mlb-awards1/23mlb-awards1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2020&h=550&w=1050&s=6e6bf87bba9e9c36b97fee427f68900a38cb8303fd7e6eb35e4238bd6d37461d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Freddie Freeman is having an M.V.P.-caliber season despite dealing with a frightening Covid-19 case before the season.,60616add-ab7d-5a40-8ca5-c385d4197ff0,N24News/imgs/60616add-ab7d-5a40-8ca5-c385d4197ff0.jpg,9

Technology,Huawei Founder Slams U.S. Charges as 'Politically Motivated',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/18/technology/huawei-ren-zhengfei-bbc.html,"BEIJING -- Ren Zhengfei, the founder of the Chinese technology giant Huawei, has accused the United States of having political motivations in leveling criminal charges against the company and his daughter, a top Huawei executive.

The comments, made in an interview with the BBC that was published Monday, mark a rhetorical escalation. Mr. Ren and the firm had previously declined to say much on the case, citing respect for the legal process. But he appears to be sharpening his language as a hearing nears on whether his daughter should be sent to the United States to stand trial.

Dance,Love-Struck Hero in a Quandary: The Other Woman's a Real Doll,https://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/02/arts/dance/coppelia-returns-to-american-ballet-theater-repertory.html,"What all these dissimilar interpretations shared was an element of monstrosity. I don't hesitate to say Mr. Zhurbin's could be their equal. He has been an exceptional performer in many roles large and small. In this Franklin version, however, he -- like others who have played the same role in it -- is merely a harmless buffoon. (An artificial nose and a wig of untidy white hair make him unrecognizable and less authoritative.) There are other reasons this ""Coppelia"" should be immediately replaced. It cuts good music from Act III; it takes the czardas, an Act I highlight, and inserts it into Act III, where it dilutes the aural atmosphere; and it diminishes the central role of Swanilda by blurring her musical and entrancing energy. (I'd love to see this company acquire the production that Sergei Vikharev staged in 2009 for the Bolshoi, which reconstructed the 1894 St. Petersburg version with its marvelous scenic detail and temperamental range. It is the only other current production to equal the Balanchine-Danilova staging across Lincoln Center plaza at New York City Ballet.)

Ms. Copeland -- one of Ballet Theater's several remarkable female soloists -- has played full-length roles before, notably Gamzatti in ""La Bayadere."" She has the charm, liveliness, and technique for Swanilda. In another production, she would surely shine brighter; I'd love to see her rival Coppelius in determined monstrosity in Act II, and play teasingly with the music of her solos in Acts I and III. It's not her fault if this heroine becomes trite; the production has had the same effect with more experienced ballerinas.

Instead, the life-enhancing character was Mr. Cornejo's Franz. When ""Coppelia"" was last revived here in 2011, an injury kept us from seeing his good interpretation. Instead we saw the amazing Ivan Vasiliev, who blew the Metropolitan Opera stage apart with the large scale of his dancing. Yet now that we see Mr. Cornejo's Franz, it proves every bit as superb. Mr. Cornejo -- different in every role -- is the most miraculous male dancer before the New York public, and the most complete, complex artist in Ballet Theater's roster.

The way he claps his legs together in an ultrahigh cabriole is thrilling; and here again was his rapid-fire, pop-pop-pop series of three double air turns. His Franz is no moral paragon: Mr. Cornejo is very funny in the way he slicks his hair down in his efforts to impress Coppelia (thinking she is Coppelius's daughter rather than the perfect doll of his making), and vivid in the way he mimes his quandary of choosing between her and Swanilda. He's impulsive, ardent, lovable, and a fountain of energy. At his Act III wedding celebration, however, love makes him not just heroic but chivalrous and poetic, too.","The three-act ""Coppélia"" returned to the American Ballet Theater's repertory on Friday, with Misty Copeland, Herman Cornejo and Roman Zhurbin playing the leading roles.",e9c6e59f-679e-5a4d-a3ec-a09a514e2862,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2014/06/02/arts/coppellia/coppellia-articleLarge.jpg?year=2014&h=611&w=600&s=a9170932b289b7f3c7e1f2a623022c1ae8f1938a70feebfa41e4b196fa751e75&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"American Ballet Theater  Herman Cornejo in the company's version of the three-act ""Coppélia"" at the Metropolitan Opera House.",e9c6e59f-679e-5a4d-a3ec-a09a514e2862,N24News/imgs/e9c6e59f-679e-5a4d-a3ec-a09a514e2862.jpg,6
Opinion,The F.D.A. Commissioner's Fuzzy Math,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/25/opinion/fda-plasma-coronavirus.html,"Dr. Hahn knows this -- or at least he ought to. As an oncologist by training and a former hospital executive, he should be familiar with basic statistics. The trouble is, Dr. Hahn is serving a president who routinely demonstrates an overt hostility to science and who is facing a tough re-election. And he's being pressed by that president to clear drugs and vaccines for use as quickly as possible -- even if they may not have been proven safe and may not be effective.

Convalescent plasma is not an unreasonable thing for doctors and scientists to pin their hopes on -- it has proved effective for other diseases, and so far it does appear to be safe for Covid-19 patients. But it has not yet shown any real benefit for them, and it's the job of officials like Dr. Hahn to be as clear as possible about that. There is a playbook for communicating information during a public health crisis -- it calls for honesty about what isn't known and transparency about how decisions are being made in light of that uncertainty.

Dr. Hahn could have stood by leaders from the National Institutes of Health who advised hitting pause on the use of convalescent plasma until more data was available. Or he could have defended F.D.A. scientists who advised moving forward even though data was limited. Instead, he followed his boss's lead, propping up victorious statements with fuzzy numbers. That's perhaps unsurprising: In a world where disinfectant therapy is discussed with a straight face, the difference between relative and absolute may indeed seem small.

But even small compromises with the truth can have big consequences for public trust, and for the course of global pandemics. It's worrisome that a doctor in charge of one of the nation's top regulatory agencies -- who will play a leading role in the coming decisions about which vaccines are safe and effective enough to be injected into Americans' bodies -- doesn't seem to realize that.",Stephen Hahn made misleading remarks about a coronavirus treatment.

Art & Design,A Tadao Ando-Designed Exhibition Space Opens in Chicago,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/12/arts/design/a-tadao-ando-designed-exhibition-space-opens-in-chicago.html,"On Friday, Wrightwood 659, a new art exhibition space designed by Tadao Ando that specializes in architecture and activist art, opened to the public in Chicago's Lincoln Park neighborhood with a show dedicated to Mr. Ando and Le Corbusier.

The venue was founded by Fred Eychaner, a media entrepreneur and philanthropist, and Dan Whittaker, an architectural historian.

""I think there are some interstitial spaces that are open for new work and new viewpoints in Chicago,"" Mr. Eychaner said in an interview on Thursday. ""That's not a criticism of any existing institutions. But we think there are a lot of things we can do here that nobody else is doing.""

For example, when the Art AIDS America show, organized by Jonathan David Katz and Rock Hushka, was struggling to find a venue in Chicago, he stepped in and created a gallery space for it. The show subsequently traveled to museums like the Bronx Museum of the Arts and the Tacoma Art Museum in Washington State.","Wrightwood 659, founded by the entrepreneur Fred Eychaner and Dan Whittaker, an architectural historian, is dedicated to architecture and activist art.",63f95cca-f3b9-5f81-b7c2-88ff3ff264e3,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/13/arts/13chicagoart-item/13chicagoart-item-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=304&w=579&s=1376c5fcc7b365f9b198e73287fbf915417ac111d21e8b1e4371925c0dc7b13c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,"The interior of the Tadao Ando-designed Wrightwood 659, a new art exhibition space founded by Fred Eychaner and Dan Whittaker.",63f95cca-f3b9-5f81-b7c2-88ff3ff264e3,N24News/imgs/63f95cca-f3b9-5f81-b7c2-88ff3ff264e3.jpg,14
Education,College Radio Heads: Off the Dial,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/education/edlife/college-radio-heads-off-the-dial.html,"INSIDE a broadcast booth, at the radio station of the State University of New York Fredonia, Jud Heussler was presiding over his hourlong comedy show ""The Morning Inferno."" In a barreling voice, he announced that he would soon be throwing a few things up on the show's Facebook page: a photo of a drunken moose he had uncovered online; a YouTube clip used for his segment ""The Yoga Minute,"" in which he and his co-host hyperventilate giddily along to the words of an earnest yoga instructor; and a video clip of the comedian Donald Glover, who was to perform on campus that night. ""Call, text, Facebook, whatever you want,"" Mr. Heussler shouted to his listeners as he logged onto Facebook to check out who was posting on the show's wall. Meanwhile, he sipped apple juice and fiddled with knobs on the audio board, plotting one of the day's big activities: the videotaping of a campus groundbreaking. Who would shoot it? Someone who knew how to operate the station's beloved Flip camera -- flipping, as it's called. If none of this sounds like classic college radio, it's not. Fredonia, a campus of 5,700 about an hour southwest of Buffalo, has two stations. And WDVL, the more popular, is so far removed from traditional radio it can't even be found on the FM dial. Instead, that station streams on the Internet, which means tousled-haired disc jockeys in faded band T's are constantly encouraging listeners to check out a rolling supply of podcasts, YouTube clips, photos and campus news on the station's Web site.

Mr. Heussler, a senior majoring in audio-radio production, is general manager of both stations. He pointed boastfully at a printout of the station's latest stats. ""You could argue that WDVL has a bigger impact beyond the campus than we do on it,"" he said. The station has about 350 online listeners a day; 40 percent of them live almost 300 miles away in the New York City area, while a mere 4 percent are on or near campus. Other log-in clusters? Los Angeles and the Czech Republic. ""People listen from everywhere,"" he said. Fredonia's radio station, with its tattered band posters and fading stickers, rickety desks and swivel chairs, and the occasional forlorn turntable or microphone jack, is plush by college standards. There is a mustard-colored couch from the 1960s in the lounge and an oversize banner of the call letters in red and black draped over an office divide. And nostalgically, a large closet houses thousands of dusty vinyls and CDs. Most of the Intercollegiate Broadcasting System's 700 college members now stream on the Internet along with, or instead of, their broadcasting efforts. The Web's freedom from Federal Communications Commission regulations is not the point. At stations like Fredonia's, the goal is to transform themselves into the multimedia platforms they believe students with unprecedented tech appetites actually want, and it is changing the ethos, content and vibe of collegiate stations. ""No one brings a radio to their dorm today,"" says Sean Owczarek, a recent Yale graduate who helped remake WYBCX, the university's online-only station, during his time as general manager there.

Instead, students arrive on campus armed with smartphones, iPods and tablets on which they can listen to music services like Pandora, an Internet station that uses an algorithm to determine what songs to play. And now that Facebook has teamed with peer-to-peer applications like Spotify, users can share music right there on the site. ITunes carries some 225 college stations. YESTERDAY, TODAY Servers at Fordham's WFUV, right, store the music that once was spun on vinyl. The two corners of the station make for a fitting symbol of the changes in college radio. Michael Appleton for The New York Times In this crowd, luring listeners, and keeping them entertained, is a matter of survival. A dispiriting number of college administrators, unclear on the need for radio stations at all, are selling their coveted space on the AM-FM dial. In the last two years 14 stations have been sold or have pending sales, according to College Broadcasters Inc., an industry association. Despite vociferous protest, Vanderbilt University in June sold the broadcast license to its indie station WRVU, a Nashville institution that promoted its music as the kind ""you can't hear anywhere else."" The sale price: $3.35 million. Brown's BSR lost its FM spot this summer, too. And after multiple attempts to scuttle the deal, Rice University recently sold its license for KTRU, which played everything from Philip Glass to shoegaze, a British rock subgenre characterized by noisy guitars and motionless musicians on stage. All three stations are now streaming online. (WRVU and KTRU can also be found on HD Radio, for hybrid digital, which requires special receivers.) To improve morale, Rob Quicke, a communications professor and general manager of the station at William Paterson University, in Wayne, N.J., organized a College Radio Day on Oct. 11. It was a call to unity in which 365 stations showcased their best work and played a segment by Professor Quicke on the value of college radio. Station managers, sounding more business than boho, increasingly meet to strategize ways to stay relevant. ""One of the big things we do is monthly conference calls with our board of directors where we brainstorm the future of our station,"" says David DyTang, a policy analysis and management major and general manager of Cornell's rock station, WVBR. ""How do we reach out to students? How do we access them through modern media?"" In one way, the students are creating an app to access the station's Web site from a smartphone. Three years ago, Fordham started up the Alternate Side as an edgier, visually stimulating option to its FM-based station, WFUV. The Alternate Side streams 24/7 on the Internet, a few hours a day on the FM dial, and on HD Radio. Student technicians videotape and edit live jam sessions that are e-mailed to listeners in a weekly newsletter and posted on the station's page. ""We call ourselves a radio station,"" says John O. Platt,WFUV's communications director. ""But we're really a multimedia content provider."" Students at Yale's WYBCX refer to their station as a ""global entity."" In response to lost listenership in 2007, students voluntarily transformed their free-format AM station into an Internet-only outfit with a highbrow mix of pop-electronica and contemporary classical. While WYBCX is like many stations in that it offers live college sports, its disc jockeys would never be satisfied streaming for just a dorm buddy. ""All our shows are designed for audiences beyond Yale,"" says the general manager, Carl Chen, a junior sociology major who is as comfortable discussing an 11-member hip-hop collective from Los Angeles as the ""media model"" the station ought to be pursuing to compete for listeners. The plan is to develop niche followings with eclectic interview shows like ""The Art World Demystified,"" ""A Glimpse of Islam"" and ""fsck,"" on the tech world.

Once upon a time, it was a hyper-local focus that constituted the beauty of the often unpolished, old-school college radio show. Disc jockeys shouted out to roommates cramming at 3 a.m. for calculus II exams, played cranky ballads to ex-boyfriends, and introduced new, underground bands. For those who recall stations as carefree places where a kid who was into music could play some tunes, even ones no one was likely to enjoy, this global-minded, strategic maneuvering is unsettling. ""College radio has traditionally been rooted in a community, a place and a time,"" says Casey Rae-Hunter, deputy director of the Future of Music Coalition, a nonprofit group that has been involved in the fight to preserve college radio. ""It's live and it's local. There is a tremendous romance to that. Without it, college radio stations risk losing their uniqueness."" DePaul University's Internet-only station garners listeners from as far away as Tokyo, and when a marketing class was asked to evaluate what the station could do to improve, there was overwhelming consensus: focus more on what's happening here, on the Chicago campus.

WKDU has long positioned itself as West Philadelphia's answer to corporate music. Playing Top 40 tunes is not allowed. Jake Cooley, a junior and the station manager, chuckles when he recalls the time, a few years back, when a D.J. propped a vacuum cleaner up to his microphone and let it roar to mimic the noisy dissonance of a black metal drone band. It was part musical experience, part D.J. bravado. Would Mr. Cooley sanction such a performance today? ""Probably not,"" he says almost apologetically. ""It's a fine line."" Larry L. Epstein, faculty adviser to WKDU, has watched the transition up close. ""These college stations are still social environments,"" says Mr. Epstein, who is also an executive board member of Cornell's WVBR. But students tend to be more deliberate about their time at them and more demanding of one another. While some of this has to do with the changing work ethos on American campuses, he says, it also has to do with the pressure stations are under. ""Their programming has to be relevant to their core audience,"" he says. ""The days of college stations that only appeal to the students who work there has come to an end."" Mr. Epstein is direct. ""I tell them: You don't want to end up another Vanderbilt."" It wasn't always like this. As mainstream radio in the 1980s and 1990s became more focused on profits, and hence more risk averse, college radio became one of the rare broadcast venues where new sounds could be introduced, according to Susan Smulyan, author of ""Selling Radio: The Commercialization of American Broadcasting."" ""College radio became a hideout,"" she says. And it relished the role. In the 1980s college radio catapulted the post-punk pop of R.E.M. into the mainstream, and is credited with discovering and promoting the 1990s grunge bands Nirvana, Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. In the early 2000s, it was college radio that helped ignite a garage band revival with the White Stripes. Even Coldplay was lifted up through the ranks of college radio. David Hargis, a former student disc jockey at Princeton's WPRB, says the power of these stations has been diluted because music blogs like Pitchfork and social networking sites, which he calls ""word of mouth on steroids,"" are offering those same opportunities to discover new music. ""There are too many other ways to get what college radio gives you,"" says Mr. Hargis, who was a paid program coordinator for KUSF, the University of San Francisco's student station, which now is found only streaming on the Internet. Mr. Vyverman, the faculty manager at Radio DePaul, says college radio can etch out a new role, but online so young listeners can do what they have grown accustomed to doing: participating. ""College students don't want: You listen to what we tell you,"" he says. ""They want two-way communication. They want to feel that their voice is being heard.""

Mr. Heussler believes another way to foster these connections is to help listeners find information on artists they want to learn more about. To illustrate this, he told the story of how two years ago, WDVL conducted a phone interview with an indie electro-pop band from Colorado called 3OH!3. The podcast included a recording of ""Don't Trust Me,"" the band's catchy, tongue-in-cheek tune about the perils of hooking up. When that song shot to No. 1 on the music charts, fans from around the world, seeking news about the band, found the Fredonia site. To old radio heads, what Mr. Heussler was describing wasn't really introducing someone to something new. You find what you're looking for; you don't find what you're not looking for. But he is not the type to get bogged down in what used to be. When asked which station was WDVL's biggest competitor, Mr. Heussler, taking a rare break in the foam-padded interview room, shrugged. ""Who are we competing with? We're competing with past generations.""","More college stations now stream on the Internet, changing the ethos, content and vibe of campus radio.",a4764df7-6ec8-5641-9433-56d5363e262b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/10/31/education/edl-06radio-t-1/edl-06radio-t-1-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=315&w=600&s=751e60a86ea76e0ed7d98241290f23dd46259af0ce90446e9ab2f2a0594f8b12&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"RADIO YOU CAN SEE Erica Talbott, foreground, a sophomore at Fordham, videotapes the Canadian group Austra for the Alternate Side, the Web counterpart of the Bronx university's station, WFUV.",a4764df7-6ec8-5641-9433-56d5363e262b,N24News/imgs/a4764df7-6ec8-5641-9433-56d5363e262b.jpg,22
Fashion & Style,In Love With 'Wonderful Things',https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/16/fashion/tim-walker-photography-victoria-albert-museum.html,"Credit...Campbell Addy for The New York Times



LONDON -- Few individuals can get the great and the good of the fashion world to put aside the gossip, rivalries and angst of runway show season. But on Tuesday night, many will dress up and mount the steps of the Victoria & Albert Museum to celebrate Tim Walker, responsible for some of the most instantly recognizable and ambitious fashion imagery of the last quarter-century, and the opening of ""Tim Walker: Wonderful Things,"" the largest solo exhibition of his photography. ""Tim is a dream catcher,"" said Amanda Harlech , a fashion consultant and longtime collaborator with Mr. Walker, who is expected to join FKA Twigs , Edie Campbell and the British Vogue editor in chief Edward Enninful for the opening. ""His photographs harness a sense of possibility. He creates strange and beautiful creatures in parallel universes that open you up onto other worlds. He deserves to be celebrated."" Since his arrival on the scene in the mid-1990s -- when he assisted Richard Avedon in New York and shot his first Vogue story at age 25 -- Mr. Walker's extravagant fairytale-themed dreamscapes, fantastical tableaux with hints of contemporary reality and muses like Kate Moss, Karen Elson and Tilda Swinton have made him one of the best-known names in the business.

That last shot is among those shown in the new V&A show, which will run from Saturday through March 8. But it is a series of major recent works that lie at the heart of the exhibition: Ten photographic projects, presented in room sets designed by Shona Heath , inspired by Mr. Walker's monthslong search through the museum's permanent collection of more than two million objects and 145 public galleries in London . It had been, Mr. Walker said as he stood in his sun-dappled East London headquarters earlier this month , a two-year labor of love that distracted him from heartbreak after the end of a 15-year relationship. ""This project really saved me. I was able to have an incredible transformation through the things I've seen and the conversations I've had,"" said Mr. Walker, 48, as he leafed through prints of the 10 shoots. ""The whole process was an enormous privilege and I feel very at peace with what we've created."" Among the objects that inspired him were a 16th-century German stained-glass window of a sleeping couple on their wedding night; a black ink print by the 19th -century English illustrator Aubrey Beardsley ; a 17th-century treasure box that took a young girl five years to make, and a series of vivid South Asian miniature paintings from 1590.

Although Mr. Walker has always stressed that he avoids being influenced by client demands or commercial constraints -- ""they are annoying, and I'm not at all motivated by the wheel of fashion and commerce,"" he said during the interview -- many of the object-inspired photographs feature luxury brand clothing and have appeared in glossy magazines. ""We had a certain budget but it wasn't going to be enough for all I had envisioned and the right caliber of crew. So I went to some magazine editors, who really let me run with the ideas -- though I didn't explain that I was doing it for the museum as it would have got complicated,"" Mr. Walker said. Mr. Enninful, who published a shoot inspired by the South Asian paintings last year , noted in an email that ""Every shoot he does is always distinctly Tim, he never compromises on his vision. He pushes the narrative one step further, every time, to a place of real wonder."" According to Mr. Walker, the V&A staff, and particularly its curator of photographs, Susanna Brown , gave him ""total free rein.""

""I was particularly interested in whether nudity and homosexuality was taboo in the V&A, partly in the wake of the Mario Testino and Bruce Weber allegations but also at a time when fashion has become quite buttoned up and worried about expressing sensuality,"" Mr. Walker said. ""But it is rife in the V&A; there are beautiful statues of men everywhere. It was reassuring to see how long artists have been expressing beauty for, and that it's all been done before."" Exploring, challenging and even subverting ideas of beauty has always been at the heart of Mr. Walker's body of work, from his 1990s coming-of-age studies set against a backdrop of the supermodels and grunge to his 2017 Pirelli calendar reimagining of Lewis Carroll's ""Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"" with an all-black celebrity cast. Today, although the fashion establishment has been clamoring about commitment to diversity and positive social change, Mr. Walker said he felt it still lagged behind wider culture and society. ""There are still so many rules and subtleties and powers and parameters that prevent people from being free in the industry,"" he said. ""That said, things are moving in the right direction. Anything that turns up the volume and includes those who have been cut out of the story until now is good as far as I'm concerned."" Less good, he said, has been the impact of social media on fashion. While the arrival of more democratic platforms for aspiring creatives has been positive, Mr. Walker said, he is troubled by what he termed the ""vanity and incessant showing off.""","Tim Walker's fashion photography, with flaming Spitfires to prowling leopards, is going on display at the Victoria & Albert Museum.",95bd4096-7407-55e3-b621-640c9fa568e7,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2019/09/16/fashion/17TimWalkerVandA-tim-walker/16TimWalkerVandA-tim-walker-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2019&h=550&w=1050&s=2d7859d32218e4c6ec194418c69c3d2369027b91d12fd0615db16693881b47a6&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,The British photographer Tim Walker at his studio in London.,95bd4096-7407-55e3-b621-640c9fa568e7,N24News/imgs/95bd4096-7407-55e3-b621-640c9fa568e7.jpg,19

""You'd roll up to La Cienega and Santa Monica Boulevard and there'd be a guy with a shaved chest and his shirt pulled down to his belly button. 'Oh, my God. What have we done?'"" Ms. Alonzo, at 37 perhaps the most influential former senior creative director you have never heard of, was sitting in a friend's apartment just off Central Park West, talking about her decadelong career with the brand that turned the T-shirt ad into an R-rated experience, before filing for bankruptcy last year. ""The first jeans we ever came out with were these high-waisted jeans,"" she said. ""That was my thing. The tube socks with three stripes. The disco pant. For better or worse, the deep V-neck.""

Indeed, her new endeavor, a clothing and lifestyle-goods company, is called Everybody. Started in November 2015 with Carolina Crespo, 38, another American Apparel alum (she was director of graphics and kids'), the brand has an unusual business model: Instead of designer-as-dictator, the women choose guest collaborators who come up with products. Ms. Alonzo, who comes across as both laid-back and intensely focused, was prompted to explore the idea, she said, by the countless times someone discovered that she worked for a clothing brand and said, ""You know what you should make?"" It wasn't the only lesson from what could have been a very painful experience. Ms. Alonzo was dismissed from American Apparel twice: in 2014, after Mr. Charney was forced out, and then, after being brought back months later, was fired again last year after the company hired a new management team.

And she had to overcome the stigma of working at a company that publicly is considered disorderly at best and at worst allegedly hostile to its work force. ""I started thinking about what I could take away from those 11 years and 11 days,"" she said. ""I went back to all the things that inspired me."" That list includes old issues of Colors magazine, the artist and designer Nathalie du Pasquier, printed matter of any kind, supporting garment workers, sewing and the work of Tibor Kalman, a graphic designer who died in 1999. Ms. Alonzo is a polymath who graduated from high school early and spent ages 16 to 24 enrolling at community colleges around Los Angeles, learning and dabbling without earning a degree.

During this time, she also interned for Nylon magazine, worked at an agency that represented photographers and was the creative director for the Freshjive Propagandist, a publication put out by the streetwear label Freshjive. Then came American Apparel, and 80-hour weeks with no vacations. Still, it all made Ms. Alonzo wonder: ""Why do the ideas have to come from a designer? I know a lot of people -- they're writers or they're architects or they're kids. But they have their own style, their own passions.""

One of those people, for example, is Jean Pigozzi, the businessman, art collector and global bon vivant who is one of the first round of Everybody collaborators. Ms. Alonzo met and befriended Mr. Pigozzi while working for American Apparel and asked him to come up with a product for the new company. The 6-foot-4 Mr. Pigozzi scribbled a design for an eight-foot body pillow, shaped like a snake that has swallowed a house. Ms. Alonzo and Ms. Crespo then applied their manufacturing know-how and fine-tuned the Hungry Snake Pillow to bring it to market. As at American Apparel, there is a focus at Everybody on local workers, and the founders say they are committed to reducing their ecological impact. One of the label's core items is a white T-shirt offhandedly called the ""trash tee"" because it's made from 100 percent recycled cotton from a mill in South Carolina, an industry first, Ms. Alonzo said. Still, Everybody, unlike her former employer, is a start-up on a shoestring budget. Only four items are currently available, ranging in price from $25 for the T-shirts to $250 for the pillow, and they're being sold only through the website Everybody.world.","Iris Alonzo, popularizer of the high-waisted jean and the tube sock, begins her second fashion act.",0919c84c-28ad-5e10-9b5e-1af5ff288464,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/11/13/fashion/13EVERYBODY4-WEB/13EVERYBODY4-WEB-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2016&h=550&w=1050&s=b49e7abb3d21ad537d17fba41269647ab353ebaf214e7502e0d98bf0b5c5612a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,Iris Alonzo had a long career at American Apparel until last year.,0919c84c-28ad-5e10-9b5e-1af5ff288464,N24News/imgs/0919c84c-28ad-5e10-9b5e-1af5ff288464.jpg,19
Automobiles,'Vette Set: An Artist's Dream Collection Relocates,https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/automobiles/collectibles/14corvette.html,"AS I carried the recyclables from my Brooklyn apartment to the building's basement garage one recent Sunday morning, I noticed that my Corvettes were gone. All 36 of them. The cars, I should make clear, were not actually mine, in that they did not belong to me in the legal sense. But they had been stored in my apartment building's garage for years, and over time I'd become a bit possessive. When friends came to visit, I'd show off the collection, pointing out the early models as my personal favorites. Although the cars were a spectacular thing to find in such an unlikely location, they looked dingy. The tires were flat. The convertible tops sagged. They were layered in dust so thick that cat prints were clearly visible from 20 feet. In the grime obscuring the rear windows, someone had written the year of each car -- '53, '54, '55 -- a complete set of Chevrolet Corvettes all the way up to 1989. What a shame, my friends usually said; someone ought to be taking care of those cars. Maybe, my father told me, you could talk to the owner -- see if he'd let you care for them.

Typing ""Brooklyn"" and ""Corvettes"" into Google quickly pointed me to the cars' back story: they were the prize in a contest sponsored by VH1, the cable music channel, in 1989. The contest awarded the whole lot to one winner, Dennis Amodeo, a carpenter from Long Island. Mr. Amodeo might have won the Corvettes, but he didn't own them for long. Before taking delivery, he sold all 36 to Peter Max, the Pop Art icon, who bought the collection for an art project. When the project was back-burnered, the cars were stored in several locations around New York City before arriving in the garage of my building. The basic story was all there on the Internet, and had inspired a vehement reaction from Corvette fans. After an article on New York magazine's Web site showed the cars in a state of seeming neglect, writers who posted on Corvette message boards let loose. Among car lovers, my father's idea was a popular dream. Patrick Gramm, the owner of a Web site, DigitalCorvettes.com, said he would be happy just to borrow one of Mr. Max's cars, the 1953 model.

""We'd love to bring it to the Corvette museum until he's ready to do something with it,"" he said. ""And then we'll bring it back."" Others who posted messages volunteered to clean up the cars and restore them free. It's fair to say that the collection exists because Jim Cahill had his own dream two decades ago. A freelance television producer, Mr. Cahill conceived and produced the promotion for VH1. ""The No. 1 reason it was done was to raise VH1's profile nationally,"" Mr. Cahill said recently. The network, then four years old, was lagging its sister network, MTV. A 1989 article in this newspaper noted that VH1 had only 65,000 viewers a day, compared with 278,000 for MTV. And VH1 was struggling to attract the older audience it was intended to reach. The promotion, Mr. Cahill said, ""had to be big, but the theme of it had to resonate with baby boomers."" Mr. Cahill, who owns a marketing and branding agency in Los Angeles, Heat Seeking Multimedia, said he came up with the idea for the contest while stuck in freeway traffic. ""I saw one of the original Corvettes slowly go by me on the other side of the freeway, and I wondered why I never bought a Corvette,"" he said. The cars lined up on Pacific Street on the day they were moved. Then he realized that the car's history aligned well with the boomer generation. ""There were Corvettes for the Elvis years, there were Corvettes for the Beatles years and there were Corvettes for the Eagles years,"" Mr. Cahill said. ""I figured that for $1 million, you could buy the whole set, taking out my entire frustration at once.""

Mr. Cahill developed an impressive way to present the idea to Tom Freston, who was president of MTV Networks at the time. He hid a batch of scale-model Corvettes under a cloth in the conference room while he explained his idea, whisking it off with a flourish when he was done. ""Tom said, immediately, 'Do it,'"" Mr. Cahill said. ""It was one of the most exciting pitch meetings I've ever been in."" Another executive pulled him aside, Mr. Cahill said, and told him to buy the cars quickly because if anyone called a finance meeting and saw what he was doing, they would stop it right away. The Corvettes were bought over several months in 1988. ""I got to shop for all the Corvettes that I'd always wanted,"" he said. ""We actually assembled them pretty quickly. The '53 was pretty hard to find -- but there's that big auction down in Scottsdale, and if you've got the dough, you can get the car."" The promotion was a big success, getting VH1's name mentioned in newscasts on local stations across the country, enticing 1.3 million callers to enter the contest by calling a 900 number (and paying a $2 fee). Mr. Amodeo was surprised when he got the call telling him of his good luck. ""I forgot all about it,"" Mr. Amodeo, now 52, said recently. ""Then they called me up and told me I won the 36 Corvettes.""

Mr. Amodeo flew to California, where he was given the cars' keys by the musician Mike Love, of the Beach Boys, at a ceremony in Culver City. It was around this time that Mr. Max heard about the contest. A friend called him, Mr. Max said in a recent interview, and told him about Mr. Amodeo's good fortune. ""I was half-asleep and went back to sleep after the call,"" Mr. Max said. ""Then I had the biggest dream ever: I was in the bleachers at a football game, and suddenly these Corvettes come out of the tunnels."" Each of the cars had a cheerleader on the back, waving pom-poms, he said. ""And the whole stadium screams, 'They're Peter Max's cars!' I've never had such a powerful dream."" Mr. Max invited Mr. Amodeo to his spacious studio near Lincoln Center in Manhattan. But the artist's initial enthusiasm had waned. ""There was a part of me that didn't know if I should get out of it,"" Mr. Max said. Nevertheless, he struck a deal to buy the cars for $250,000 in cash, artworks valued at $250,000 and a percentage of the proceeds from any future sale of the cars, up to an additional $1 million.

Mr. Max, occupied with other projects and a legal battle with the I.R.S., was not ready to start realizing his Corvette dream immediately. ""For a while, maybe a year or two, I didn't know what to do with them,"" Mr. Max said. ""I started feeling guiltier and guiltier. What do you do with 36 cars?"" In this case, he shuffled them among storage garages, finally ending up in the basement of my Brooklyn apartment building, which was once a Daily News printing plant. Taking up much of the available garage space, the collection prompted some resentment from residents. Mr. Max, whose original idea for the project involved painting the cars in the vivid, saturated colors he is famous for, says he now intends to proceed. But the new plan, he said, represents ""a blend between what Peter Max the artist would do and what Corvette people would do."" In contrast to the jet he once painted for Continental Airlines or the racecar he painted for the late Dale Earnhardt, his new vision calls for a more subtle treatment. ""I'm going to paint them so it's respectful,"" he said. Each car would incorporate some of Mr. Max's best-known images, like his famous LOVE poster or his Cosmic Runner, a striding figure in bell-bottoms and a star-spangled jacket.

The new project, if it proceeds, would include a total of 50 cars -- the added cars taking the collection up to 2003 -- Mr. Max said. After being painted, the cars would go on an exhibition tour before being auctioned as a set. But the project's fate hinges on the participation of a business partner, whom Mr. Max would not identify, to provide the money for 14 more cars. ""Can you imagine showing these cars at Yankee Stadium or Giants stadium?"" Mr. Max said. ""It would be a fun thing to re-enact the dream."" In the meantime, the cars have been relocated from the garage in my Brooklyn building to a building in Upper Manhattan, where they await the next development. ""Sometimes the little boy in me comes up with things, but you have no idea how to realize it,"" Mr. Max said. ""Like a dream, right?""","A collection of 36 Corvettes, once the prize in a nationwide contest and now owned by the artist Peter Max, has gathered dust for 20 years.",d88ea293-64dd-5b12-99db-7ad4803cdd31,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/02/14/automobiles/14corvette-span/14corvette-span-articleLarge-v2.jpg?year=2010&h=400&w=600&s=e72484cd068df65abc30595fa816717bd35317f90388e336586279850fcdfbff&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN,EVICTED Peter Max's Corvettes in the Brooklyn garage.,d88ea293-64dd-5b12-99db-7ad4803cdd31,N24News/imgs/d88ea293-64dd-5b12-99db-7ad4803cdd31.jpg,23
Global Business,Advice on Debt? Europe Suggests U.S. Can Keep It,https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/17/business/global/europeans-struggle-to-clear-hurdles-to-latest-euro-rescue-plan.html,"WROCLAW, Poland -- The United States has long been considered a financial adviser to the rest of the world. But these days, American officials come carrying baggage. Financial officials from the United States, once called ""the committee to save the world"" after the Asian crisis in the 1990s, now find themselves uttering apologies for the harm caused to the world by the 2008 financial crisis and coating their advice to European nations with the knowing nod of the battle-hardened. The change in tone was on display here on Friday when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner made an unusual appearance at a meeting of euro zone finance ministries. Mr. Geithner had been invited to offer some advice on fixing Europe's sovereign debt and banking problems. European leaders, who have been slow to react to the root causes of the problem, emerged from the meeting dismissive of Mr. Geithner's ideas and, in some cases, even of the idea that the United States was in a position to give out such pointers.

""I found it peculiar that, even though the Americans have significantly worse fundamental data than the euro zone, that they tell us what we should do,"" Maria Fekter, the finance minister of Austria, said after the meeting Friday morning. ""I had expected that, when he tells us how he sees the world, that he would listen to what we have to say."" Such criticism was echoed by other attendees of the meeting, including the finance minister of Belgium, Didier Reynders, who said Mr. Geithner should listen rather than talk. Jean-Claude Juncker, president of the finance minister group, said European officials did not care to have detailed discussions about expanding their bailout fund ""with a nonmember of the euro area."" American officials are aware that they need to tread carefully when advising others, especially now, and they have avoided offering specific plans or proposals. Instead, they point to recent programs in the United States simply as case studies. On Friday, Mr. Geithner, among other recommendations, encouraged the European leaders to add more firepower to their bailout funds, and described how the United States used leverage in 2008 to help bolster the markets. The Treasury department said in a statement Friday that ""Secretary Geithner encouraged his European counterparts to act decisively and to speak with one voice."" And a Treasury official said the department did not feel Mr. Geithner was rebuffed, because he did not have a specific agenda.

In the past, countries with financial problems have not always received the United States' advice with open arms, at least until they needed financial support. Europe, analysts say, may never need outside support if its political leaders can find a way to use the wealth of nations like Germany to shore up more debt-troubled countries like Italy. Still, it is hard to argue that the United States is not in a far weaker place to be doling out advice than it was in past crises, especially after the gridlock in August over raising the debt limit. ""We're in a very different world environment right now,"" said Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, a political consulting firm. ""The United States has diminished credibility -- it can't simply tell Europe what to do. And it lacks the political will or means to throw a lot of cash at European troubles, even though they could become American problems very quickly."" It was unusual for Mr. Geithner to attend an internal meeting of the 17 financial ministers from European Union countries that use the euro. The meeting was held on the first of two days of talks in Poland, and so far European finance ministers are no closer to overcoming the hurdles holding up the plan they developed for Greece back in July. Mr. Geithner did not offer up a fully developed plan or urge one particular action. According to an American official who was not authorized to comment publicly, the Treasury secretary urged Europe to send a strong message to the market by putting up a large enough sum of money to support its debt-ridden nations and banks. He suggested that could be done through the use of borrowed money, as the United States did in some programs in 2008. One program, known as TALF, was meant to revive lending in the consumer and small-business markets. ""If you show the market that you have what it takes to stand behind your banks and stand behind your sovereigns, it will cost less in the end,"" said Lael Brainard, under secretary for international affairs at the Treasury. Some Europeans have expressed ideas similar to Mr. Geithner's for a broader rescue plan. Still, the United States faces a different sort of audience when giving ideas to Europe than it does when facing officials in developing economies.

""In the 1990s, there were lots of countries that would say, that's working in the United States, how can we copy that?"" said Gary Gensler, who worked at the Treasury in the 1990s and now leads the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. ""We're still very much the leader in financial regulations and in the financial markets, but the 2008 crisis showed we failed. Our financial regulatory system failed and Wall Street failed."" Some policy makers say the United States might even be wise to turn to China as a partner in persuasion. ""Maybe this should be a joint effort,"" said Sheila C. Bair, a senior advisor at the Pew Charitable Trusts, who was the chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation until this summer. She said it would be helpful for China and the United States to give European leaders the same message. But, she said, referring to the United States' financial crisis in 2008, ""we certainly don't have clean hands in all this."" Countries with financial problems do not want outside advice until they need outside money, said Jeffrey Shafer, who was the under secretary for international issues at the Treasury in the 1990s. ""There are different stages in this process, and Europe right now is kind of in a halfway house,"" he said. ""The reality is that you get more influence when you are providing support."" It would be difficult for the Obama administration to persuade Congress to give loans to Europe, analysts say, but there are other options. The Federal Reserve can open its discount window to European banks or, as it has already done, it can use foreign exchange lines. The Treasury could also lend out money from a facility that helps with exchange-rate problems. Or the United States could promote additional aid from the International Monetary Fund. Even if the United States offered more aid, it is unclear if Europe would want it. Edwin M. Truman, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute who has worked with Mr. Geithner, said the United States had questions to answer, too. ""It's not just a question of being the scolding school teacher,"" he said. ""Geithner will also have to give a convincing story that we're dealing with our problems.""",The United States has long been considered a financial adviser to the rest of the world — until now.,c77e3d52-711f-5485-8fee-360c1b4e4f9b,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2011/09/17/business/global/17euro-sub/17euro-sub-articleLarge.jpg?year=2011&h=330&w=600&s=0791380012cb0f93118efdeca6bad261ba70d72ca3f0f5c53011bdda14ae58ab&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1,"Treasury Secretary Timothy F.
